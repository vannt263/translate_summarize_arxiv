    "massive stars are born , evolve and end their lives in clusters .",
    "massive stars in general possess fast and dense stellar winds that interact with their surroundings .",
    "initially , the wind sweeps up interstellar material , until the wind - blown bubble encounters a similar bubble produced by another nearby star , at which time an interaction between these two stellar winds takes place .",
    "these interactions occur at highly supersonic velocities , leading to diffuse emission at x - ray frequencies , as has recently been demonstrated both theoretically ( raga et al .",
    "2001a ; cant , raga & rodrguez 2000 ) and observationally @xcite for the _ arches _ cluster near the galactic center .",
    "the most massive stars have very short lifetimes ( @xmath110@xmath2 years ) and they reach the supernova ( sn ) stage while all of the other stars are still on the main sequence , or have just recently evolved beyond it .",
    "thus , it is to be expected that when the sn occurs , the ejecta will encounter and collide with the stellar winds of the other massive stars within the cluster .",
    "these interactions should also be a source of x - rays . in this paper",
    "we analyze the consequences of such collisions , and we apply the results to snr 0057 - 7226 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and its possible interaction with the stellar wind of the luminous blue variable / wolf - rayet ( lbv / wr ) binary system hd 5980 .",
    "hd 5980 is the most luminous point source in the small magellanic cloud and is believed to consist of a close binary pair , both having wolf - rayet characteristics ( niemela 1988 ) and a third , possibly line - of - sight o4 - 6 type component ( koenigsberger et al . 2002 ) .",
    "its eruptive mass - shedding events as well as the wind - wind interactions within the close pair have kept it under scrutiny for several years .",
    "hd 5980 is found at the edge of ngc 346 , the largest cluster in the small magellanic cloud .",
    "the age of the cluster is estimated at @xmath110@xmath2 years .",
    "a nebulosity believed to be a supernova remnant lies on the foreground of hd 5980 .",
    "this remnant might give rise to the @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 component observed in the uv absorption lines towards hd 5980 ( see fitzpatrick & savage 1983 ) .",
    "this nebulosity , snr 0057 - 7226 , is associated with the x - ray source ikt 18 ( inoue 1983 ) , that was confirmed to be a non - thermal radio shell by ye et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , having a diameter of 3.2  ( 55 pc ) .",
    "it is the second most luminous snr in the smc at 843 mhz .",
    "an x - ray image recently obtained with chandra @xcite displays extended emission ( @xmath5 ; i.e. , 39@xmath629  pc ) with a luminosity of @xmath7 ergs s@xmath4 in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev band .",
    "the fact that the x - ray emission is centered on hd 5980 could well be a coincidence .",
    "however , uv and fuv observations ( de boer & savage 1980 ; koenigsberger et al . 2001 ; hoopes et al . 2001 ) indicate that the portions of the snr that are approaching the hd 5980 system have a different ionization balance than the opposite side ( i.e. , the side approaching the observer ) .",
    "these observational results could be explained if the receding portions of the snr are interacting with the stellar wind from hd 5980 .",
    "the analysis of this possibility is the primary motivation for undertaking the present study .",
    "for the numerical simulations carried out in this paper , we have used an axisymmetric version of the _ yguaz - a _ adaptive grid code , which is described in detail by raga et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and which has been tested with laboratory explosion simulations ( sobral et al .",
    "2000 ; velzquez et al .",
    "2001a ) , in snr models @xcite and jets @xcite .",
    "the gasdynamic equations are integrated with a second order accurate ( in space and time ) implementation of the  flux - vector splitting \" algorithm of van leer ( 1982 ) , together with a system of rate equations for atomic / ionic species .      due to the symmetry of the problem given by the axis which is joining the location of the sn explosion with the position of the star , we perform the integration of the cylindrically symmetric gasdynamic equations .",
    "a 4-level binary adaptive grid with a maximum resolution of @xmath8  cm was employed , in a 50@xmath6  25 pc ( axial@xmath6  radial ) computational domain .    for the initial conditions , several assumptions are possible : ( a ) the snr and the stellar wind are  turned on \" simultaneously , ( b ) the stellar wind is already present when the sn explodes , or ( c ) the sn explodes first , and then the stellar wind is  turned on \" .",
    "we assume that the sn explosion and the stellar wind are turned on at the same time .",
    "simulations can be carried out varying all of the different parameters of the calculation ( terminal wind velocity , mass loss rate , distance between the star and the snr , energy of the sn explosions , ism density ) .",
    "however , we limit the present study to models with characteristics applicable to the hd 5980 system . hence ,",
    "in all simulations we have fixed the stellar wind mass - loss rate at @xmath9  yr@xmath4 , which is typical of massive o - type stellar winds .",
    "the wind - shedding star is located at @xmath10  cm from the origin of the coordinate system , while the center of the snr is located at @xmath11  cm .",
    "thus , the separation between the pre - sn and the normal star is of @xmath12  cm .",
    "the calculations were initialized considering that the the radius of the initial remnant is of @xmath13  cm .",
    "the density of the homogeneous ism into which the snr and the stellar wind are expanding is assumed to be of 1  @xmath14 , while its temperature is of @xmath15  k.    five numerical simulations were carried out considering different values for the initial sn explosion energy , @xmath16 , and the terminal velocity of the stellar wind , @xmath17 .",
    "these numerical models are labeled `` a '' to `` e '' and are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the different values of @xmath16 are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ergs , while the values of @xmath17 are 1500 and 2500 km s@xmath4 .",
    "columns 2 and 3 of table [ table1 ] list the values of these parameters that correspond to each model .    in order to compare our numerical simulation with chandra observations ,",
    "we have computed x - ray emission maps for the 0.3 - 10 kev photon energy range , using the chianti atomic database ( dere et al .",
    "2001 ) . for the calculation of the x - ray emission coefficient we have assumed a modified shull ionization equilibrium ( shull & van steenberg 1982 ; arnaud & rothenflug 1986 ; landini & monsignori fossi 1991 ) and that all of the excitation is in the low - density regime ( in this case , the emission coefficient is proportional to the square of the density ) . the abundances for heavy elements were taken from the fit to the x - ray spectrum by naz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a comparison between the density evolution for model a ( panels on the right ) and model e ( panels on the left ) .",
    "the top panels ( for @xmath22  yr and @xmath23  yr ) represent the density distributions at the time when the encounter between the snr shock wave and the stellar wind first occurs . the spherical shell located on the left hand side is the wind - blown bubble surrounding the star . note that there is a difference of more than 2 orders of magnitude between the density in the wind - blown bubble and the stellar wind which it encloses , due to the fact that the stellar wind has swept up material from the interstellar medium into which it is flowing . as expected , the more energetic sn results in a remnant that expands and reaches the wind of the star sooner ( 8000 yr , model e ) than the less energetic sn ( 17000 yr , model a ) .",
    "once the snr shock wave has reached the wind - blown bubble , two secondary shock waves are produced , one propagating into the remnant ( s1 ) and the second one in the direction of the star ( s2 ) , sweeping up the material in the wind - blown bubble and in the stellar wind .",
    "this is illustrated in the following panels of figure 1 , which present the density evolution at temporal intervals of 5000 years , from top to bottom .",
    "the secondary shock wave that is propagating into the snr material ( s1 ) is almost spherical , unlike the shock wave that is moving into the stellar wind ( s2 ) , which initially presents a wavy structure that subsequently evolves into finger - like features .",
    "the propagation of these finger - like structures is clearly seen in model e , in which the evolution occurs more rapidly than in the lower energy sn models . at @xmath24  yr ( bottom left panel ) ,",
    "these structures have reached the opposite side of the wind - blown bubble .",
    "the eventual fate of the wind - blown bubble is that only a small portion lying close to the symmetry axis of the interaction remains while the rest will have been swept up by the snr .",
    "as the snr advances into the stellar wind , the s2 shock adopts the shape of a bow - shock , enveloping the star .",
    "the bottom - left panel of figure 1 shows this structure very clearly ( at @xmath25  cm ) .",
    "the finger - like features are most likely produced by rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instabilities for the following reasons .",
    "the basic conditions for the onset of the r - t instability are the existence of two media with different densities , and an effective gravity with an orientation in the direction that goes from the high density to the low density medium .",
    "both of these conditions are met in the interaction region .",
    "the gas behind the snr shock wave is almost two orders of magnitude denser than the gas in the wind bubble ; and a calculation of the gradient of the ram pressure across the interaction region for the @xmath26  erg simulation at @xmath27  yr , yields an effective gravity at the location of the snr / wind interaction region of @xmath28  cm s@xmath29 , directed outwards from the sn .",
    "furthermore , using the values given above for the effective gravity and the density ratio , and considering a typical size of @xmath30  cm for the initial perturbation ( consistent with the radius of the wind bubble at the time when the wind / snr interaction starts to take place , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , one obtains a @xmath31  s@xmath4 growth rate for the r - t instability . this growth rate is equivalent to a @xmath32  yr timescale , which is consistent with the time in which the finger - like structures develop in our simulation ( which is smaller than the 5000  yr time - intervals between the successive frames of fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the qualitative nature of the interaction does not depend significantly on the velocity of the stellar wind , for values that are reasonable for o - type stars .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] , the general features described above for the density evolution of the interaction also appear for a stellar wind having @xmath33  km s@xmath4 ( model b , panels on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the panels on the right of this figure reproduce the case with @xmath34  km s@xmath4 ( model a ) . from top to bottom , the panels of figure 2 display the morphology of the interaction at temporal intervals of 10000  yr , starting with initial contact between the snr and the stellar wind .",
    "an example of the kinematical characteristics of the flow that would be seen by an observer located along the symmetry axis in the positive @xmath35 direction is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "assuming that the observer is at rest with respect to the undisturbed environment of our simulations , the radial velocities of the absorbing ( or emitting ) gas are given by @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the axial velocity of the flow ) .",
    "in this example , we present the velocity profile of the gas that lies along the symmetry axis at t=27000  yr , for model a ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the wind - shedding star is located at @xmath38 cm , and the portion of its stellar wind that is receding from the observer can be seen as the ( cut - out ) maximum to the left of this position .",
    "the portion of its stellar wind that is approaching the observer is seen as the ( cut - out ) minimum , just to the right of this position .",
    "the extension in the @xmath35-direction of this portion of the stellar wind is not as great as in the case of the receding wind , since it encounters the snr ejecta ( denoted as `` a '' in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this encounter not only slows down the wind , but it leads to a shock wave ( s2 , described above ) having a velocity in the opposite direction ( i.e. , towards the star ) .",
    "it is interesting that even though the expansion velocity of the snr is lower than the velocity of the stellar wind , the balance of the momentum is in favor of the snr and the interaction region has this net velocity towards the star .",
    "the velocity along the @xmath39axis towards the star at position `` a '' is 120 km s@xmath4 , not too different from the radial velocity of high - ionization ultraviolet ism components observed in absorption at 150 km s@xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath40  km s@xmath4 after sustracting the average systemic velocity for the smc of @xmath1 150  km s@xmath4 ( de boer & savage 1980 ; koenigsberger et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the components observed in the far - ultraviolet absorption components ( hoopes et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the shock wave that is moving into the snr ( s1 ) has a velocity of @xmath1@xmath4140 km s@xmath4 ( denoted as `` b '' in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) in the direction of the observer . in front of this shock ,",
    "unperturbed snr material is found , having velocities of 60 km s@xmath4 , decreasing systematically as the location of the progenitor of the snr ( at @xmath42 cm ) is approached , where @xmath43 .",
    "the velocities between this point and the unperturbed ism , in the direction of the observer , range from 0 to @xmath41150 km s@xmath4 .",
    "note that this latter velocity , when corrected for the average smc systemic velocity ( @xmath1 150 km s@xmath4 ) , lies at the velocity of the local ( galactic ) ism .",
    "hence , the absorption features that may be produced in this region of the snr ( marked  c \" in fig .",
    "3 ) would be superimposed on the local galactic ism absorptions and thus would be very difficult to observe .    if we assume a systemic velocity of @xmath44  km s@xmath4 for the snr ( koenigsberger et al .",
    "2001 ) , the absorption components generated by our models at the opposite sides of the snr ( locations `` a '' and `` c '' in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) would be observed at @xmath45  km s@xmath46  km s@xmath4 and @xmath47  km s@xmath48  km s@xmath4 , thus suggesting that the pair of lines corresponding to the snr that were observed by koenigsberger et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are really the @xmath49  km s@xmath4 pair .      for all of the numerical models",
    "we have obtained simulated x - ray emission maps . for each of these maps ,",
    "we have calculated total x - ray luminosities within the 0.3 - 10 kev band at different times , and these results are summarized in columns 5 and 6 of table [ table1 ] .",
    "the time for which the calculation is made is listed in column 4 .",
    "the first time corresponds to initial contact between the snr and the stellar wind ; the second and third times correspond in all cases , except for model e , to 10000 yrs and 20000 yrs after initial contact . in the case of model e ,",
    "the calculation was made at 15000 yrs .",
    "the relative orientation of the snr / wind collision region with respect to the observer is an important parameter for the calculation of the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission , and we shall discuss this below . for the moment , however , we shall concentrate on the case in which the angle between the @xmath39axis of our calculations and the line - of - sight to the observer is 0 ; that is , the observer is situated on the extreme right in figures 1 and 2 and , therefore , views the interaction region `` face - on '' .",
    "the top panel in figure [ fig4 ] displays the x - ray emission at the time of initial contact between the snr and the stellar wind for model a. superposed on the emission arising in the snr as a whole , two zones of higher intensity x - ray emission can be identified : a ) the rim of the snr , where the mass density is high due to the swept - up ism ; and b ) a central dot , which corresponds to the location of first contact between the snr and the wind . the x - ray emission at this stage is dominated by the snr .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity is @xmath50  erg s@xmath4 in the 0.3 - 10 kev band , of which only 1.3@xmath610@xmath51  erg s@xmath4 arises in the shocked and unshocked stellar wind .    as time procedes ,",
    "the interaction between the snr and the stellar wind involves more and more material , and the emission from the unperturbed snr decreases .",
    "thus , the relative contribution to the x - ray emission arising in the interaction zones becomes more significant .",
    "the second panel in figure [ fig4 ] illustrates the x - ray emission at @xmath52 yr , 20000 yr after initial contact .",
    "the ring of intense x - ray emission that is visible in this figure corresponds to the regions of stellar wind that are making their first contact with the snr .",
    "these regions have densities that are particularly high due to the presence of swept - up material ( both by the snr and the stellar wind ) .",
    "there is also a small ring near the center of the bright ring which , although significantly fainter , is visible in this same figure .",
    "this ring corresponds to emission from the bow shock that by this time has been formed , enveloping the star .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity at this time is @xmath53  erg s@xmath4 .",
    "our simulations indicate that the combination of unperturbed stellar wind + shocked stellar wind contribute 1.4@xmath610@xmath51  erg s@xmath4 to this luminosity ; i.e. , 35% of the total x - ray luminosity .    figure [ fig5 ] presents the same results discussed above in relation with figure [ fig4 ] , but for model e. the outer ring and the inner ring correspond to the interaction of the snr with the ism and the bow shock enveloping the star , respectively , as in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "in addition , the third ring ( counting outwards ) is analogous to the bright ring in the lower panel of figure [ fig4 ] ; i.e. , it corresponds to the first contact between previously unperturbed portions of the wind - blown bubble and the snr .",
    "because the sn in this example is more energetic , the evolution of the snr / wind interaction takes place on shorter timescales than in the example shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "thus , the lower panel in figure [ fig5 ] displays features that have not yet formed at the evolutionary time illustrated in the lower panel of figure [ fig4 ] . in particular , the second ring ( counting from the inside ) corresponds to the finger - like features illustrated in the right panels of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the total x - ray luminosities are much larger for this case , reaching values of up to 9@xmath54  erg s@xmath4 at @xmath55 yr , but the stellar wind+interaction regions account for only @xmath56 ergs s@xmath4 of this emission .    these simulated x - ray luminosities may be compared with the values obtained from the chandra maps of the regions around hd  5980 by naz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who derive @xmath57 erg s@xmath4 in the 0.3 - 10 kev band .",
    "this luminosity lies within the range of values for the luminosity of the entire region ( snr+stellar wind+interaction regions ; column 5 of table [ table1 ] ) obtained from our simulations , for a sn explosion with @xmath16 in the 1@xmath415@xmath610@xmath58 erg range . for @xmath5910@xmath58 ergs ,",
    "the predicted x - ray luminosities are too large compared with the observations .",
    "note that for such an energetic sn , the relative contribution to the x - ray luminosity is completely dominated by the snr , with a negligible contribution from the stellar wind and from the wind / snr interaction region .",
    "we now turn to the morphology of the region , and as mentioned above , the angle between the symmetry axis ( @xmath39axis ) and the plane of the sky as viewed by an external observer has a significant effect on the shape of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "we have already discussed the morphology for the case in which the observer is located along the @xmath39axis . in figure",
    "[ fig6 ] , we compare the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission arising in the density distribution computed for model a at 37000 yrs and for model e at 23000 yr , but viewed at three different angles . at 80 ,",
    "the morphology is very similar to that illustrated in figures 4 and 5 , but the central rings are displaced to one side of the star s location . at 45 ,",
    "the displacement is significantly more noticeable , and in the case of model e , only a segment of the bright ring formed by the interaction between the stellar wind and the snr is apparent . at 60 , the morphology is intermediate between the other two angles for which the x - ray emission is illustrated .",
    "naz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) describe the morphology of the x - ray emission as having a size of @xmath60 , i.e. 37@xmath629  pc and containing a few bright or dark arcs , with no obvious limb - brightening .",
    "one of the arcs that appears to be centered on the star is rather diffuse and clumpy , and has an approximate diameter of 60 , corresponding to a physical size of @xmath61  cm . in figure 7",
    "we reproduce the x - ray image of hd 5980 , presented by naz et al .",
    "( 2002 ; their figure 8) , and compare it with the results of model a ( top panel ; t=37000 yr ) and model e ( middle panel ; t=23000 yr ) , both of which are calculated under the assumption of an 80angle between the symmetry axis and the plane of the sky .",
    "the crosses in the simulations indicate the location of the star , which is clearly visible as the dark dot in the chandra image ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the size of the extended emission is closer to that given by model a than that of model e. if we assume that the outermost regions of the extended emission can be associated with the snr rim , then this region is also more similar to model a than to model e , which has too bright a rim .",
    "however , the contrast between the internal ring in model a and the background x - ray emission is much greater than the observed contrast . in this respect ,",
    "the observations are more similar to model e. furthermore , there is obviously much more structure in the observations as predicted by model e , rather than model a. hence , the extended emission associated with hd 5980 presents a morphology that may be described as intermediate between the morphologies predicted by models a and e , consistent with the result that the observed x - ray luminosities lies between the ones predicted from model a and e. a feature that is not predicted by the simulations is the protrusion at the top left of the x - ray image .",
    "clearly , the simulations are based on idealized assumptions concerning the symmetry and homogeneity of both the snr and the stellar wind and its wind - blown bubble . in reality , each of these components are likely to be clumpy and may depart significantly from spherical symmetry , and could possibly give rise to the more complex structures observed in the chandra image .",
    "in this paper we describe the interaction of a snr with the wind of a nearby massive star .",
    "this interaction leads to localized sources of x - ray emission embedded in the diffuse emission of the snr .",
    "the emission arising in the snr / stellar wind interaction is a substantial fraction of the total x - ray luminosity several thousand years after the snr - stellar wind interaction has initiated .",
    "the x - ray luminosity depends primarily on the energy of the supernova event .",
    "the simulations are consistent with the general features recently observed in the extended x - ray emission surrounding the wr / lbv binary system hd 5980 , supporting the possibility that this extended x - ray emission includes contributions from the interaction between the snr and hd 5980 s wind . assuming this scenario ,",
    "the initial energy of the sn was 1 - 5@xmath62 ergs , and the sn event occurred between 23000 and 37000 years ago .",
    "in support of this scenario , the radial velocities of ism features that have been observed in the uv and fuv wavelength regions at @xmath40 km s@xmath4 ( or @xmath63150 km s@xmath4 with respect to the stationary smc ism ) are consistent with the velocity of the shock front that is expanding into the stellar wind of hd 5980 which is predicted by the simulations .",
    "however , before concluding that the 300  km  s@xmath4 heliocentric component observed in the spectrum of hd 5980 indeed comes from the wind / snr interaction region , detailed predictions of the absorption line profiles using gasdynamic models are required .",
    "the simulations predict the presence of x - ray bright rings .",
    "the observations indicate the presence of arcs , rather than rings .",
    "the rings appear as a consequence of the assumed symmetry in the stellar wind and in the snr . clearly , a more detailed model for hd 5980 should contemplate the possibility of a more irregular structure . in particular , hd 5980 consists of two stars with strongly interacting stellar winds , which can lead to the formation of large - scale structures .",
    "in addition , hd 5980 has undergone a recent lbv - type eruption associated with the star that is currently undergoing a transition from o - type to wr star . in the past ,",
    "similar enhanced mass - loss episodes are likely to have occurred .",
    "hence , the stellar wind which the snr is encountering is likely to be structured , with high and low density regions .",
    "this will lead to additional fluctuations in the density stratification of the interaction region , and will definitely produce a more irregular x - ray emission map than the one predicted from our simple model .",
    "the interaction with the snr ends up destroying the wind - blown bubble that surrounds the star , leaving only a bow shock separating the snr and the stellar wind , and a small segment of the material that was swept - up by the stellar wind on the opposite side of the star .",
    "the entire phenomenon for the cases we have modeled is very short - lived ( @xmath64  yr ) , which , combined with the low frequency of sn events , makes it a very rare phenomenon , not likely to be frequently observed .",
    "however , a long - lasting effect is the fact that once the interaction of the snr with the stellar wind has transpired , any material that had been swept up by the stellar wind is removed , and the subsequent propagation of the stellar wind into the ism proceeds unhindered , as it expands into the snr cavity .",
    "the short - lived phenomenon we describe must occur in all young massive star clusters .",
    "we can speculate that if the sn explodes near the center of the cluster , the ejecta will interact with a large number of o - type stars , not just one , as in our simulations .",
    "assuming that each interaction region leads to a luminosity of @xmath110@xmath65 ergs s@xmath4 , and that there are 100 nearby o - type stars , a luminosity of @xmath110@xmath66 ergs s@xmath4 is predicted from the whole cluster .",

    "<S> we model the x - ray emission from the snr - stellar wind collision region and we compare it with recent results from x - ray observations carried out with the chandra satellite of the smc supernova remnant snr 0057 - 7226 which could be interacting with the wind of the wolf - rayet system hd 5980 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations predict the presence of shell - like regions of enhanced x - ray emission which are consistent with the presence of x - ray emitting arcs in the chandra image . </S>",
    "<S> also the observed x - ray luminosity is comparable to the x - ray luminosities we obtain from the simulations for a supernova with an initial energy in the 1 - 5@xmath0 erg range . </S>"
