    "when sequence sites evolve independently under a markov process along the branches of a tree @xmath2 , the sequences observed at the tips contain information concerning the underlying tree .",
    "this allows for the tree @xmath2 to be reconstructed accurately from sufficiently long sequences ; this is the basis of modern molecular systematics @xcite .",
    "the number of sites required to reconstruct @xmath2 accurately depends on how long the edges of the tree are .",
    "more precisely , it depends on the expected number of substitutions on each branch ( edge ) @xmath3 of the tree  which we refer to as the _ branch length _ of @xmath3 ( this is the product of the temporal duration of the branch and the substitution rate ) .",
    "a number of authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have considered various ways to quantify the phylogenetic signal in aligned dna sequences , and to estimate the sequence length required to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree .",
    "most of these studies have involved simulation or heuristic approaches , although some analytical bounds have also been obtained @xcite . typically",
    ", these bounds state that if an interior branch length is very short , or if a terminal ( external ) branch length is long , then a large number of sites will be required .    in this paper",
    "we explore these results further by obtaining bounds that are expressed purely in terms of the relative sizes of the branch lengths , not their absolute values .",
    "one motivation for our approach is that different genes are known to evolve at different rates , so that any particular branch length will depend on which gene is considered ; however , the ratios of the branch lengths will be unchanged if the gene - specific rate applies uniformly across the tree .",
    "a particularly difficult tree reconstruction problem , requiring long sequences to resolve , arises when one has an interior edge with a short branch length incident with edges ( or subtrees ) having large branch lengths .",
    "such a scenario occurs , for example , when a relatively rapid speciation event ( leading to the short branch length for that edge ) occurred in the distant past ( leading to the large branch lengths for the incident edges ) .",
    "several examples of this have been highlighted in the literature @xcite and include the origin of metazoa and the origin of photosynthesis .    in this paper",
    "we analyse a scenario which , although somewhat idealised , nevertheless captures the essence of this problem  a four - taxon tree , where the terminal edges have equal branch lengths that are @xmath4 times the branch lengths of the interior edge , and a simple symmetric model of site evolution ( specifically , we assume sites evolve independently according to a common two  state markov process ) .    we provide a mathematical analysis to the question of how many sites are required to resolve the tree correctly ( from the three possible resolved topologies on four taxa ) .",
    "we are particularly interested in how the growth of the sequence length , @xmath5 , depends on @xmath0 , independent of the absolute value of a particular edge length .",
    "we establish that @xmath5 must grow at the rate @xmath1 , which implies that regardless of how fast ( or slow ) any particular sequence is evolving , we can set definite lower bounds on the length of sequences required to resolve the tree .",
    "we then show that for our setting , @xmath1 growth in @xmath5 is the best possible , as an existing method ( namely , maximum parsimony ) achieves this bound .",
    "our results complement an earlier simulation - based analysis @xcite .",
    "we contrast our results by considering a quite different model of site evolution ( the infinite state model ) and establishing that order @xmath0 growth in @xmath5 can sometimes suffice for this model .",
    "we also extend the approach to more general markov processes on trees , obtaining exact , but less explicit lower bounds on @xmath5 and which involve absolute ( rather than relative ) branch lengths .",
    "our arguments are based on standard techniques from probability theory , such as central limit approximation , and information - theoretic arguments based on the properties of hellinger distance .",
    "consider an unrooted binary phylogenetic tree on four taxa , say @xmath6 , with branch length @xmath7 for the interior edge @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the terminal edges @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and the topology of the tree is shown at the top of fig .",
    "the other two competing topologies ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) are also shown in fig .",

    "suppose that a sequence of binary characters are generated independently and identically ( i.i.d . ) under a symmetric two - state model on the tree .",
    "this model is often called the cfn ( cavender - farris - neyman model ) or more briefly the neyman 2-state model ( for more details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although it is the simplest non - trivial markov process on a tree , it allows for an exact analysis .",
    "moreover , stochastic results for this model typically extend to more general finite - state models where an exact analysis is usually more complex @xcite , and in section  [ extend ] we show how some of our approaches extend to more general markov processes .",
    "if we denote the substitution probability on edge @xmath15 by @xmath16 , then for each terminal edge we have @xmath17 while for the central edge @xmath8 , we have @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 for @xmath20 then we can express these five @xmath21 values in terms of @xmath22 as follows : @xmath23    now , if we fix @xmath7 and let @xmath0 grow , or , alternatively , if we fix @xmath9 and let @xmath7 tend to zero , then the sequence length @xmath5 required to reconstruct the topology of the generating tree accurately tends to infinity .",
    "this holds for any tree reconstruction method that treats all three topologies fairly ( if a method has an a priori preference for one topology , it will perform worse on an alternative topology ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 is fixed , then @xmath5 grows at the rate @xmath24 as @xmath7 tends to zero ( by theorem 4.1 of @xcite ) .",

    "<S> in evolutionary biology , genetic sequences carry with them a trace of the underlying tree that describes their evolution from a common ancestral sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the question of how many sequence sites are required to recover this evolutionary relationship accurately depends on the model of sequence evolution , the substitution rate , divergence times and the method used to infer phylogenetic history . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly challenging problem for phylogenetic methods arises when a rapid divergence event occurred in the distant past . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse an idealised form of this problem in which the terminal edges of a symmetric four  taxon tree are some factor ( @xmath0 ) times the length of the interior edge . </S>",
    "<S> we determine an order @xmath1 lower bound on the growth rate for the sequence length required to resolve the tree ( independent of any particular branch length ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that this rate of sequence length growth can be achieved by existing methods ( including the simple ` maximum parsimony ' method ) , and compare these order @xmath1 bounds with an order @xmath0 growth rate for a model that describes low - homoplasy evolution . in the final section , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a generic bound on the sequence length requirement for a more general class of markov processes .    </S>",
