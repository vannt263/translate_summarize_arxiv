    "the morphological class of a galaxy correlates well with its physical properties : hi content , stellar population via color , specific angular momentum ( e.g. roberts & haynes 1994 ) , present and past average star - formation rates ( kennicutt , tamblyn , & congdon 1994 ) .",
    "principal component analysis indicates that , for both disk and elliptical galaxies , roughly 90% of the variance in galaxy properties is accounted for by only two variables which are related to form ( or morphology ) and scale ( luminosity or size ) , respectively ( okamura , watanabe , and kodaira 1988 ) .",
    "fortunately , both of these quantities can be measured by imaging alone at large distances and , furthermore , these properties are closely related to the formation process and thus likely to be keys to understanding the formation and evolution of distant galaxies .",
    "hubble ( 1926 ) devised our basic system of galaxy classification , and this was extended by devaucouleurs ( 1959 ) and by sandage ( 1961 ) .",
    "the morphological type of a galaxy is determined by a number of properties including the bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio and the tightness and degree of resolution of spiral arms .",
    "the classification has historically done from rest frame blue band images .",
    "the process is subjective , but it is repeatable and there is a good measure of agreement between different workers ( lahav 1995 , buta et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the ability to classify galaxies by hubble type visually from ground - based images is severely compromised as redshift increases , and the process is impossible at the redshifts investigated here because much of the detail is smoothed away by the effects of seeing .",
    "nevertheless , quantitative information can be obtained from the light distribution and a classification based on fractional bulge luminosity ( larger in early - type galaxies ) can be done at high redshift .",
    "the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) provides a sample of @xmath14 galaxies with@xmath15 and measured redshifts ( see le fvre et al .",
    "1995 cfrs ii , crampton et al .",
    "1995 cfrs v , and references therein ) .",
    "the high median redshift ( @xmath16 ) together with the @xmath17 band ( 8300  = rest frame @xmath18 at @xmath19 ) selection makes it possible to construct high - redshift samples of galaxies that are directly comparable to the local population .",
    "the evolution of the tri - variate galaxy luminosity function @xmath20 is discussed by lilly et al .",
    "1995 ( cfrs vi ) .",
    "the luminosity function of the red population evolves very little whereas that of the blue galaxies varies strongly with redshift .",
    "the luminosity function is a statistical description of the population and does not imply any particular physical interpretation .",
    "the observed behaviour of the blue population can thus be equally well described as a uniform brightening of individual galaxies with increasing redshift or as the presence of a numerous new population that is absent at the present day .",
    "physical information about individual galaxies , such as morphology or kinematics , is needed to break this degeneracy .",
    "the fine resolving power of the hubble space telescope makes it uniquely powerful for studying high - redshift galaxies .",
    "work is in progress ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1994 , griffiths et al .",
    "1994a ) but , to date , few redshifts exist for faint ( @xmath21 ) , high - redshift ( @xmath22 ) field galaxies that have been observed with hst .",
    "schade et al . 1995",
    "( cfrs ix ) present results for a sample of 32 galaxies with @xmath23 from two fields of the cfrs , the first analysis based on secure redshifts from a carefully selected sample .",
    "the present work relies critically on the excellent seeing at mauna kea , and exploits the wide field capabilities of ground based imaging cameras to establish the basic morphological properties of larger numbers of high - z galaxies in the cfrs .",
    "although the resolution is much lower than @xmath13 , at the present time this is the largest sample with secure redshifts and is thus an important preliminary to large numbers of observations of @xmath24 galaxies with hst .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the modelling of the two - dimensional luminosity distributions of high - redshift galaxies with functions that have been found to be appropriate for nearby objects (  2 ) and present simulations to demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach using ground - based imaging (  3 ) .",
    "our observations for a sample of 195 objects ( both stars and galaxies ) are described in  4 along with the results of the model - fitting . in  5 we discuss the relation between the morphological results and the evolving luminosity function and compare our work with previous results including our own @xmath13 imaging .",
    "photometry is presented in the @xmath25 systems ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , and it is assumed throughout that @xmath28 km sec@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "our choice of models is guided by the two considerations .",
    "first , the fitted parameters must be comparable to morphological parameters that have been derived from nearby galaxies and , second , it must be possible to extract these parameters reliably for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the resolution in physical units in the frame of the galaxies is much smaller in this study than in similar local studies so that these two considerations are not trivial .",
    "the best approach is to use the simplest models that have been used to fit the luminosity profiles of nearby galaxies .    a discussion of techniques for photometric decomposition of galaxies into distinct components is given by simien ( 1988 ) .",
    "few systematic studies have been carried out on samples larger than 50 galaxies .",
    "surface photometry on small samples of galaxies has been done by freeman ( 1970 ) , kormendy ( 1977b ) , burstein ( 1979a,1979b ) , boroson ( 1981 ) , and analyses of larger samples have been done by van der kruit ( 1987 ) , kent ( 1985 ) , and kodaira , watanabe , and okamura ( 1986 ) .",
    "these references include discussions of the relative merits of various fitting functions and the difficulties of decomposing multi - component luminosity profiles .",
    "most of the above studies use the devaucouleurs @xmath31 law to describe the compact spheroidal components and an exponential profile to fit the disk components . clearly",
    "the gross structure of most galaxies can be described by these models . on the other hand ,",
    "all studies find some anomalous galaxies that can not be well - fitted by standard models .",
    "the fraction of such galaxies ranges from about 25% ( poor or impossible fits from kent 1985 ) to 13% ( kodaira , wanatabe , and okamura 1986 ) and the failures are caused by the presence of structures such as bars , dust lanes , spiral structure , and galaxy cores which are not accommodated by the simple models adopted here . the most severe difficulty in a study like the present one is not the statistical uncertainties in the model - fitting process but the likelihood of systematic errors due to these additional structures .",
    "nevertheless , the majority of the measurements will be meaningful if the high - redshift galaxy population has a similar distribution of morphological properties to the local population .",
    "in particular , the gross size measurements of disks will be largely unaffected by moderate peculiarities in the luminosity profiles .",
    "disk - dominated galaxies constitute 60%80% of the field galaxy population ( buta et al .",
    "1994 ) and the typical disk size ( @xmath32 few kpc scale length or 0.35 arcseconds at @xmath33 ) is large enough to be measured using ground - based imaging with excellent seeing .",
    "the typical scale size of the galaxies discussed here is smaller than the fwhm of the point - spread function so that a careful treatment of the convolution with seeing is an important part of the present analysis .",
    "empirical point - spread functions ( psfs ) formed the basis of the analysis using daophot software ( stetson 1987 ) to construct and manage the psfs .",
    "the construction of the psf followed usual procedures for stellar photometry ( stetson 1987 ) using a number of bright stars , fitting and subtracting , examining the residuals to exclude stars with near neighbors or other flaws .",
    "the psf varied little with position on the ccd whereas frame - to - frame variations were large .",
    "the radius over which the psf was defined was typically 5 arcseconds .",
    "an idealized , continuous galaxy model is transformed into the observational space by defining the galaxy center , orientation , and scale with respect to the detector pixel grid .",
    "the galaxy model is convolved with the point - spread function and the resulting luminosity distribution is integrated over each pixel to produce the expected number of counts in each pixel of the observed image , given the model parameters .    in practice , a discrete point - spread function ( psf )",
    "is used ( it can be derived directly from the data thereby dispensing with the requirement that it conform to some analytical form ) and the continuous galaxy model is integrated over each detector pixel .",
    "the convolution is then executed using discrete fast fourier transforms .",
    "the bulge component is represented by a devaucouleurs @xmath34 law : @xmath35\\ ] ] and the disk component by : @xmath36 where i(0 ) is the central surface brightness , @xmath37 is the bulge effective ( or half - light ) radius , and @xmath38 is the disk scale length . if @xmath39 give the position of the galaxy center , then at a position @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the position angle of the major axis of the bulge component and @xmath47 is the axial ratio ( minor / major ) of the bulge .",
    "a similar equation holds for the disk component .",
    "the position angles of the two components are allowed to vary independently .    in order to minimize sampling errors ,",
    "the psf is shifted to the position of the centroid of the galaxy .",
    "a fixed - precision simpson s rule integration scheme evaluates each integral to a minimum precision of 1 part in a thousand .",
    "multiple images of an object ( as many as 30 in our data ) are paired with their corresponding psfs and all fitted simultaneously . in this way , images of an object obtained with different instruments and filters ( including parameters accounting for the difference in color between bulge and disk ) can be efficiently analysed .",
    "weighting is strictly according to poisson statistics .",
    "pixels affected by cosmic rays were excluded from the fits . a levenberg - marquardt non - linear fitting algorithm ( press , teukolsky , vetterling , & flannery 1992 ) which proved robust , was used to locate the minimum in @xmath48 .",
    "errors were estimated from the covariance matrix and verified using simulations .",
    "extensive simulations were done to gain an understanding of both the parameter space being investigated and the properties of the fitting procedure . the simulations used idealized models of galaxies at @xmath16 and @xmath49 ( 0.5 magnitudes brighter than our limit : 30% of the cfrs sample is fainter than this ) with signal - to - noise ratios typical of the data used in this paper .",
    "galaxy models did not include bars , dust lanes , spiral structure , or other irregularities .",
    "the point - spread - functions ( psfs ) are empirical and derived from the data .",
    "they were assumed to be known exactly .",
    "the seeing in the simulations was set at 0.67 arcseconds ( fwhm ) , roughly equal to the median of the real data .",
    "errors in centroiding , sky subtraction and psf shifting were included .",
    "the pixel scale for all simulations was 0.20 arcseconds / pixel to match our prime focus imaging .",
    "three models were fit : a ) disk only , b ) bulge only and c ) bulge - plus - disk model , and the model with the smallest value of @xmath48 was accepted .",
    "most of the galaxies are expected to be disk - dominated ( an expectation supported by the outcome of this study ) .",
    "thus , a typical and important case is represented by a galaxy with a small bulge fraction ( b / t=0.20 : approximately sb ) at @xmath16 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the bulge size was fixed according to local relations ( sandage and perelmuter 1990 ) at @xmath51 arcseconds ( 2.2 kpc ) .",
    "galaxies similar to these are expected to be common in the present sample .",
    "the sky was measured and fixed prior to the fitting process and galaxy models were normalized to the number of counts in the data being fit .",
    "the normalization was done after convolution and within an aperture corresponding to optimum signal - to - noise ratio ( computed individually for each galaxy ) .",
    "derived parameters were compared for the two cases where the sky was known exactly and where the dispersion in the sky determination was 0.1% ( typical of the sky level uncertainty in the real data ) .",
    "the mean recovered parameters and the dispersion in those parameters were not measurably different in the two cases . on the other hand , errors of 1.0% in the sky determination had a severe effect on the determined parameters ( and their errors ) showing that the sky must be well - determined .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of varying the disk scale length , @xmath38 , ( and thus the surface brightness since the total luminosity is fixed ) from 0.10 arcseconds ( 0.8 kpc at @xmath16 or 0.5 pixels ) to 1.6 arcseconds ( 12 kpc ) .",
    "the fitted parameters were disk scale length , axial ratio ( the true value was @xmath52 ) , and position angle as well as bulge fraction ( @xmath2 ) , bulge effective radius , and bulge axial ratio ( the true value was @xmath53 ) .",
    "the position angles of the bulge and disk were assumed to be coincident .",
    "the dispersion in the recovered scale lengths is about 20% and systematic errors are small .",
    "the worst errors are at the largest scale length which has the lowest signal - to - noise ratio per unit area .",
    "the dispersion over the most relevant range in size ( @xmath54 arcseconds ) is 5 - 10% . showing that meaningful measures of disk size can be made from ground - based imaging for realistic - sized late - type galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the typical dispersion in the recovered integrated disk brightness is 15% over the range @xmath54 arcseconds and this represents a reasonable uncertainty for late - type galaxies in the sample of real galaxies .",
    "the dispersion in recovered bulge fractions ( @xmath2 ) depends on scale length but @xmath55 of the galaxies ( with true @xmath56 ) have a measured @xmath57 . over the range of the most relevant scale lengths ( @xmath54 arcseconds )",
    "@xmath58 is a good estimate of the error .",
    "a set of simulations was constructed of a galaxy at @xmath16 with varying b / t ( results in figure 2 ) .",
    "as @xmath2 varies , the bulge and disk sizes were also varied to agree with locally - defined surface brightness constraints .",
    "the axial ratios of the bulge and disk were 0.9 and 0.75 respectively . over the full range of @xmath2 ,",
    "the worst dispersion is @xmath59 in @xmath2 and the median dispersion is 0.14 .",
    "distinctions between early and late - type systems can be made but the further subdivision of late - type systems is difficult . for galaxies like these we can construct perhaps three classes : 1 ) early ( @xmath60 ) , 2 ) mid - type ( @xmath61 ) 3 ) late - type ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the corresponding hubble types are roughly 1 ) e , 2 ) s0-sa , 3 ) sb - sd .",
    "the preceding experiment also indicates that is possible to obtain useful measurements ( @xmath63 or better ) of disk scale lengths for galaxies with @xmath64 . for earlier - type galaxies",
    "the disk contributes much less light and its size is very difficult to measure .",
    "bulge sizes can be measured reliably for galaxies only if @xmath65 .",
    "it has been shown that model parameters can be recovered with reasonable accuracy from simulated datasets . in reality , the galaxy type is not known beforehand and it must be demonstrated that the fitting process does not result in a biassed estimate of the population properties .",
    "this could happen , for example , if a large fraction of mid - type galaxies were systematically mis - classified as ellipticals .",
    "only a crude classification is attempted here ( @xmath2 larger or smaller than 0.5 ) to determine the fraction of disk galaxies that might have been misclassified .",
    "such misclassification might result in a biassed view of the properties of the disk galaxy population .    in order to derive the completeness fraction for disks as a whole , it is necessary to know the intrinsic distribution of types and use this knowledge as input to the simulation process .",
    "this information is not available but can be estimated either from the local galaxy population or from the results of the fitting of the high - redshift population . in figure 3 a simulated population",
    "is shown ( type is determined by bulge fraction @xmath2 ) .",
    "this generic distribution ( a bias toward later types ) is similar to the magnitude - limited distributions shown by buta et al .",
    "the galaxies that make up this simulated population cover a range in sizes and inclinations consistent with the real objects at high redshift and are all simulated at @xmath49 .",
    "the top panel of figure 3 shows the distribution of types used as input to the simulation .",
    "the second panel of figure 3 shows the recovered distribution of @xmath2 after fitting the simulated population . the number of galaxies in the extreme bins ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) is large and has been shared with the adjacent bins to improve the plots . the fraction of galaxies that are correctly classified as early ( @xmath68 ) or late ( @xmath69 ) was computed and found to be in excellent agreement with the fraction expected if the error in determining @xmath2 was @xmath58 . if the distribution of types were uniform ( all types equally likely ) then 84% of the population would be correctly classified according to our criterion . in the example population shown here",
    "the completeness is higher : 88% of the late - type galaxies are correctly classified .",
    "the final panel shows the measured distribution of @xmath2 in the real galaxy sample .",
    "the number of galaxies with @xmath70 is 67 and these have again been redistributed over 3 adjacent bins for plotting purposes .",
    "evidently the sample of real galaxies is dominated by late - type ( disk - dominated ) systems .",
    "a distribution of this shape ( heavily weighted toward late types ) will result in a higher fraction of correctly classified galaxies than would either a uniform distribution or the distribution used as input to the simulation shown in figure 3 .",
    "it could , therefore , be argued that 90% or more of the real galaxies are correctly classified .",
    "however , this is expected to be true of galaxies like those in the simulations ( smooth profiles with no bars , dust lanes or any other structure ) .",
    "any structural irregularities could modify this fraction substantially .",
    "a comparison of the ground - based results with those from @xmath13 imaging ( cfrs ix ) demonstrates that such abnormal structure does not severely affect the present results .",
    "there are 22 objects in common between the present sample and the _ hst _ imaging work in cfrs ix .",
    "( a number of galaxies at @xmath71 that did not appear in that work are included here . )",
    "figure 4 shows a direct comparison of the parameters derived from ground - based and _ hst _ imaging for the galaxies in common .",
    "disk scale lengths are measured consistently from both datasets .",
    "the scatter in @xmath2 is large but note that @xmath72 of the @xmath2 values lie within @xmath73 of one another .",
    "solid symbols are galaxies that were classed as peculiar / asymmetric based on the _ hst _ images .",
    "several of the most serious differences between the measurements of @xmath2 from the two data sets are for these asymmetric objects .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , ( at least for objects that are measured as bulge - dominated from @xmath13 and disk - dominated from the ground ) the measured disk scale lengths agree well for these asymmetric objects .    an estimate can be made of the effect that asymmetric objects will have on the measurements in the present study . according to cfrs ix ,",
    "the asymmetric objects constitute 30% of the high - redshift sample . according to figure 4 about half of the asymmetric objects",
    "have their fractional bulge luminosities underestimated from the ground - based data .",
    "( but bear in mind that the parameter @xmath2 may be poorly - defined for asymmetric objects . )",
    "it seems likely that objects of this type would tend to produce spurious measurements that would be interpreted as high surface brightness disks and this is a possible source of bias in measured disk properties .",
    "an examination of the scatter in the comparison of @xmath13 and ground - based measurements suggests that the number of objects with @xmath74 as measured from the ground should be increased by a factor of 1.6 to account for those scattered to smaller @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , 3/4 of the scattered objects are likely to be asymmetric / peculiar ( a propertiy that increases the likelihood that they will be scattered to @xmath57 ) and , therefore , likely to be bngs .",
    "this correction factor will be used in /s4.4 .    in addition , the relative fractions of early and late - type galaxies will be affected by the errors in ground - based measurements of @xmath2 and this will scatter galaxies with @xmath75 into the disk - dominated region , with the result that these will be classified and measured as disk - dominated systems .",
    "the main effect will be to introduce a population of small `` disks '' with high central surface brightness .",
    "the effect of such a possible bias is not too severe simply because disk - dominated galaxies are in the majority .",
    "the conclusion from figure 4 is that both disk sizes and bulge fractions are measured well from both ground - based and space - based images _ if the galaxies are regular_. there is considerable dispersion in the estimates of @xmath2 and a small number of serious discrepancies .",
    "the latter may be responsible for quantitative differences in , for example , the amount of disk brightening as measured from _ hst _ compared to cfht and this issue will be addressed in  4.4 .",
    "a number of conclusions can be drawn from the simulations and the comparison of ground - based and space - based imaging .",

    "\\5 ) a comparison with results derived from @xmath13 imaging shows that the major source of serious error is due to un - resolved irregular or asymmetric structure that can not be detected from the ground .    taken together these results",
    "indicate that it is possible to make useful quantitative measures of normal high redshift galaxies from high - quality ground - based data . in particular , measures of disk sizes can be made reliably for the majority of normal galaxies assuming the morphological mix is similar to that observed locally .",
    "on the other hand , the effect of non - regular structure must be taken into account .",
    "it is important to reiterate that these results are for high - redshift galaxies near the magnitude limit of the cfrs survey .",
    "it is substantially easier to measure parameters for brighter galaxies or those at lower redshift .",
    "observations were obtained at canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) 1992 june 2 - 3 and 1994 may 7 - 8 . during the first run",
    "the prime focus ccd camera was used with pixel scale of 0.207 arcseconds per pixel and the seeing ranged from fwhm 0.6 to 0.8 arcseconds .",
    "a complete description of the 1992 observations is contained in cfrs i. the field was observed in @xmath82 and @xmath17 filters for equal integration times in a mosaic pattern which resulted in a varation of exposures for a given galaxy from 2700 to 10800 seconds in each filter .",

    "the images were bias subtracted and flat - fielded with dome flats . finally , for each frame a sky flat was created from a median of the program frames excluding the frame to be flattened .",
    "the exclusion was done to remove the effect of each program galaxy on the flat that was used to process its own image .",
    "local sky values were measured for each galaxy and the mean for each group of 10 nearby galaxies was adopted as the sky for all of the 10 members of that group .",
    "the dispersion in sky for a group on the prime focus imaging was typically 0.1% of the sky value for the prime focus images .",
    "fewer galaxies were available on each sis image .",
    "consequently , the error in the sky was typically 0.3% .",
    "the prime focus imaging has a wide field ( @xmath84 ) and typically 6 - 8 reasonably bright stars are included in the psf , but the higher resolution ( sis ) data covered a much smaller field of view per ccd frame and a correspondingly smaller number ( 1 - 3 ) of possible psf stars were available . as many as 30 images of a single galaxy were available ( in total from both instruments in both colours ) and each image was extracted and retained as a separate datum , each with a corresponding point - spread function to minimize the effects of sampling and uncertainty in the psf .",
    "the fitting of each galaxy was done simultaneously over all of the individual images of that galaxy .",

    "the distributions of axial ratios ( shown in figure 5 ) for disk - dominated ( @xmath57 ) and bulge - dominated ( @xmath75 ) galaxies are significantly different .",
    "this is expected if the intrinsic flattenings of the two populations differ and the result suggests that we are making meaningful classifications based on @xmath2 .",
    "the flat distribution of axial ratios also indicates that a bias in central surface brightness is unlikely .",
    "the distributions of rest - frame color , @xmath86 ( obtained by interpolatation among the spectral energy distributions of coleman , wu , and weedman 1980 , see cfrs vi for details ) are shown in figure 6 .",
    "galaxies with @xmath75 have a redder distribution of rest - frame colors than those galaxies whose light profiles are dominated by a disk .",
    "this is further support for the @xmath2 classifications although there is evidently a small population of apparently bulge - dominated galaxies with very blue colors ( these are the `` blue - nucleated galaxies '' identified in cfrs ix , see below ) .",

    "a crude correction factor was derived in  3.4 to account for the scattering of galaxies with @xmath75 into the region @xmath57 .",
    "the correction was derived from very few galaxies and is thus uncertain .",
    "the fractions of galaxies with @xmath75 in the cfht and @xmath13 samples are 0.23 ( 33/143 ) and 0.41 ( 13/32 ) respectively , a significant difference . applying the correction factor of 1.6 indicates that @xmath90 galaxies with @xmath75 may have been scattered into the @xmath57 .",
    "then the corrected fraction for the ground - based sample is 0.37 ( 53/143 ) , comparable to the @xmath13 sample . of these 20",
    ", 75% are likely to be asymmetric and we will assume that these are all bngs .",
    "then the corrected freqeuncy of bng s would be 26% at high redshift ( compared to 30% from @xmath13 ) and 13% at low redshift , roughly a doubling in the rates of occurrence due to this correction .",
    "this result is plausible and brings the ground - based and @xmath13 results into close agreement .",
    "this analysis demonstrates that no significant contradiction exists between the ground and space - based results and that systematic errors due to unresolved structures are likely to be responsible for any apparent differences .",
    "figure 8 shows the relation between scale length and disk luminosity .",
    "the relation for galaxies with @xmath91 ( median @xmath92 ) does not differ substantially from the freeman ( 1970 ) constant surface brightness relation ( dotted line ) or the samples of kent ( 1985 ) and van der kruit ( 1987 ) ( small symbols ) . the mean inclination corrected central surface brightness in the rest frame is @xmath12 ( standard error of the mean ) .",
    "this agrees with the findings of colless et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that little evolution in disk properties has occurred at these redshifts . the same relation for 70 galaxies with @xmath22 ( median @xmath93 )",
    "is shown on the lower panel of figure 8 .",
    "nearly all of the galaxies lie away from the fiducial realtion .",
    "the mean rest - frame central surface brightness is @xmath9 , approximately 1.6 magnitudes brighter than the freeman value .",
    "a comparison of the disk brightening with the value derived from @xmath13 imaging ( cfrs ix ) shows good agreement .",
    "the @xmath13 value ( @xmath94 magnitudes ) differs at the 1.5 @xmath95 level but this discrepancy is easily explained as a result of small systematic errors due to scatter in the @xmath2 measurements due to asymmetric structure ( see  3.4 ) .",
    "it is interesting to examine the space density of disks as a function of size and compare this `` size function '' at high and low redshift . in principle , the present sample is magnitude limited with no selection related to galaxy size ( cfrs i ) .",
    "weighting by the inverse of the accessible volume ( calculated as in cfrs vi ) allows us to derive the space density as a function of scale length within the apparent magnitude limits of the survey .",
    "the space density of disks as a function of scale length @xmath38 ( the size function ) is shown in figure 9 . at high",
    "redshift the number of small disks ( scale lengths @xmath96 kpc ) with luminosities greater than @xmath97 is @xmath98 mpc@xmath99 compared to @xmath100 mpc@xmath99 at low redshift , a substantial difference .",
    "the number of disks at @xmath6 in this same size range but more luminous than @xmath101 is @xmath102 mpc@xmath99 .",
    "thus it is necessary to reach only @xmath103 magnitudes lower in luminosity at low redshift to find a space density of small disks directly comparable to that at high redshift .",
    "this simply demonstrates that a scenario of moderate luminosity evolution of individual disk galaxies reproduces both the observed evolution of the luminosity - size relation and the observed change in the space density of small luminous disks between @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "no change in numbers of galaxies is required .",
    "this is directly analagous to the situation with the luminosity function of blue galaxies ( cfrs vi ) where it is necessary to reach down a magnitude or so deeper into the luminosity function at @xmath106 to get the same space density as at @xmath107 .",
    "it was found ( cfrs vi ) that the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function is dependent on galaxy color .",
    "the luminosity function of the reddest galaxies ( redder than present - day @xmath88 ) shows very little change , either in number density or characteristic luminosity .",
    "the luminosity function of the blue galaxies shows strong evolution .",
    "the luminosity function provides a statistical description of the galaxy population . as such",
    ", it contains no direct information about the evolution of individual galaxies .",
    "the observed luminosity function is consistent with the fading of each of its constituent galaxies by @xmath108 magnitude between @xmath33 and @xmath109 .",
    "it is also consistent with the existence of a new population of objects at @xmath33 with a luminosity distribution similar to the normal population but with a space density a factor @xmath110 times as high as the population that exists at @xmath109 .",
    "more complicated scenarios including color evolution whereby galaxies cross the red - blue divide can also be constructed that are consistent with the luminosity function behavior . in other words ,",
    "the behavior of the luminosity function can be described equally well by a number of evolutionary schemes .",
    "morphology provides further constraints on the evolution of individual galaxies .",
    "the relation between color and morphology indicates that the color selection applied in the luminosity function derivation is similar to our purely morphological cut at @xmath78 , between disk - dominated galaxies and bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "in particular , disk - dominated systems form the majority of our galaxies and are nearly all bluer than the nominal red - blue division . therefore , it is reasonable to identify those galaxies with @xmath68 with the blue population whose luminosity function is evolving rapidly .",
    "( the bng galaxies are a second component of the blue population . )",
    "galaxy disks at @xmath71 have a size - luminosity relation that is consistent with no evolution compared to the local relation .",
    "the luminosity function at these same redshifts agrees reasonably well with that determined locally ( cfrs vi ) .",
    "the morphological result agrees basically with the luminosity function result .    at @xmath24",
    "the morphological analysis reveals an apparent brightening of a large fraction of disk galaxies relative to the local population .",
    "this represents a dramatic change in the properties of these galaxies .",
    "the evolution in the luminosity function shows a brightening of the characteristic luminosity by @xmath108 magnitude .",
    "this rough correspondence of the morphological and luminosity function analyses suggests that one of the components of the evolution in the lf is due to the brightening of individual ( nearly normal ) disk galaxies rather than to a dramatic change in number density due to merging or the disappearance of an exotic population .",
    "these results , taken at face value , imply that _",
    "nearly all _ disks have substantially enhanced rates of star - formation compared to present - day galaxies whereas local observations indicate that the star - formation history of nearby disk galaxies is a strong function of their present - day hubble type ( kennicutt , tamblyn , & congdon 1994 ) .",
    "the ratio of present to past - average star - formation rates varies from @xmath1111/10 to unity for @xmath112 to @xmath113 galaxies respectively .",
    "this implies that some fraction of disks should have higher surface brightness in our high - redshift sample but not all .",
    "in fact , those with constant star - formation rates are expected to have lower surface brightness at high redshift .",
    "why do we see , almost exclusively , enhanced disk surface brightness ?",
    "selection is probably part of the answer : if part of the population has higher surface brightness ( and therefore higher luminosity ) then that part of the population will be preferentially observed in a magnitude limited sample .",
    "the full answer is likely to be more complicated and a detailed reconciliation of these results needs to be done .",
    "in addition to the observed disk - brightening , a second evolutionary effect appears to be the emergence of the `` blue nucleated galaxies '' ( bngs ) identified in cfrs ix .",
    "it has been argued (  4.4 ) that the frequency of this phenomenon in the ground - based sample should be corrected for the effects of abnormal structures .",
    "the derived correction factor leads to the estimate that bngs make up 26% of the sample at @xmath24 ( compared to 30% of the @xmath13 sample ) , and 13% at low redshift .",
    "the difference in frequency is suggestive but not very significant .",
    "the bng phenomenon has been shown to be strongly associated with asymmetric structure and mergers / interactions ( cfrs ix ) but these perturbations are difficult or impossible to detect from ground - based data so we can not confirm this association .",
    "the virgo cluster contains a population of spiral galaxies with large , star - forming bulge - like central concentrations ( van den bergh , pierce , & tully 1990 ) that may be a related phenomenon .",
    "this class of objects makes up a significant fraction of the total population and is probably a second major component of the evolution of the galaxy population at high redshift .",

    "the present work is consistent with these previous results .",
    "our disk sizes are supported by the work of griffiths et al ( 1994a ) .",

    "the work by driver et al .",
    "( 1995 ) has a number of strong similarities to our own conclusions .",
    "the ground - based imaging lacks sufficient resolution for a meaningful estimate of the fraction of irregular / peculiar galaxies discussed by glazebrook , ellis , and santiago ( 1995 ) although @xmath13 imaging a ( cfrs ix ) indicates that 30% of high - redshift ( @xmath24 ) galaxies have display structural asymmetry .",
    "that fraction counts as asymmetric / peculiar those galaxies with more than @xmath117 of the total galaxy flux contained in an asymmetric component .",
    "the peculiar fractions agree if each is taken at face value , but the lack of a consistent definition of peculiar / asymmetric structure among different groups makes it unclear whether frequencies of the same types of structures are being compared .",
    "in addition to the concern that different groups may be defining asymmetric , peculiar , or irregular structure differently , there is a complete lack of analogous measurements in the local galaxy population . without that context , the frequency of such structures in the faint galaxy population is difficult to interpret .",
    "the disks of late - type galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath118 ) have a higher mean surface brightness than either their local counterparts ( freeman 1970 ) or the galaxies in the present sample at @xmath119 .",
    "the majority of the disks that we detect are apparently forming stars at a higher rate at high redshift than at low by a factor of 2 - 4 .",
    "the correspondence of the change in disk central surface brightness and the behavior of the luminosity function of blue galaxies ( cfrs vi ) suggests that moderate luminosity evolution of normal disk galaxies is a major evolutionary effect on the galaxy population .    at high redshift ,",
    "14% of the galaxy population are classified as `` blue - nucleated galaxies '' but the true frequency of occurrence is probably larger by a factor of 2 when the effect of systematic errors is included .",
    "there is a hint ( at the @xmath120 level ) that the frequency of this bng phenomenon increases with redshift .",
    "this phenomenon is probably an important second component in the evolution of the galaxy population .",
    "the multi - variate galaxy luminosity function + @xmath121 shows that strong evolution is occurring in the blue galaxy population at high redshift ( cfrs vi ) .",
    "the present results illustrate the progress that can be made when additional morphological dimensions are added to the general multi - variate galaxy distribution function + ( e.g. , @xmath122 ) ) of which the luminosity function is one projection .",
    "a discussion of a second projection , the `` size function '' , gives additional weight to the suggestion that luminosity evolution of individual disk galaxies is a major component of the evolution of the population .",
    "the evolution of an individual galaxy can be described by a vector with components @xmath123 , etc . , and the sum of these individual vectors gives the corresponding changes in the distribution function @xmath124 .",

    "the present ground - based sample begins to demonstrate the power of this approach to morphological analysis but detailed measurements of the morphological parameters of a sample much larger than that presented here , and with much higher - quality imaging ( only possible with _ hst _ ) will produce more stringent constraints on models of galaxy evolution than those that exist at the present time .",
