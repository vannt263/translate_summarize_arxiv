    "first , this is where future large space - based proposals are likely to focus their attention ; jwst will already provide an important new large aperture facility for science longward of @xmath2 m .",
    "second , below @xmath2 m is where the future capabilities of ao from the ground are most uncertain and least documented .",
    "ao corrections in the infrared ( ir ) are typically more capable and less technically challenging than in the optical ( see section  [ s : aotypes ] ) . however , in comparing performance of space versus ground in the ir , careful consideration must be given to the role of background emission in achieving a given signal - to - noise ratio @xmath3 ( see section  [ s : sn ] ) .",
    "we will not discuss here the relative cost for new optical observing facilities on the ground or in space .",
    "observational facilities in space are generally more expensive to build and operate than those on the ground .",
    "so they are usually pursued only if they open up parts of parameter space that are not accessible from the ground .",
    "we highlight which parts of observational parameter space are uniquely accessible only from space .",
    "scientific motivations for access to this parameter space are briefly mentioned where relevant .",
    "costs and science drivers are discussed in detail in other submissions to the decadal survey .",
    "one of the main advantages for ground - based facilities is that they can generally be constructed with larger telescope diameters @xmath4 than what is possible in space , which impacts two important characteristics : the collecting area and the diffraction limit .",
    "[ [ collecting - area ] ] 2.1.1 .",
    "collecting area + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the collecting area of a telescope scales as @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that large - aperture ground - based telescopes are generally able to collect more photons than space - based telescopes , which is one of the factors that determines the achievable depth and signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath3 ; see section  [ s : sn ] ) .",

    "this implies that large - aperture ground - based telescopes generally have a smaller diffraction limit than space - based telescopes .",
    "however , due to atmospheric turbulence it is more difficult for ground - based telescopes to achieve image quality near the diffraction limit than it is for space - based telescopes , especially at optical wavelengths ( see sections  [ ss : imqual ] , [ s : aotypes ] and  [ s : contrast ] ) .",
    "one of the most fundamental advantages of space - based over ground - based observations is the fact that light can be observed unaffected by the atmosphere .",
    "this impacts several important characteristics of the observational parameter space .    [",

    "this blocks an entire wavelength range in which many astrophysical problems can be uniquely studied . even in",
    "the optical there are spectroscopic absorption features ( possibly time - variable ) associated with telluric bands .",
    "these need to be corrected using observations of standard stars , which themselves are only characterized to finite accuracy .",
    "[ [ background ] ] 2.2.2 .",

    "figure  1 compares the background at mauna kea and l2 .",
    "the shot noise from the background affects the the achievable depth and @xmath3 ( see section  [ s : sn ] ) .",
    "in addition , background variations can lead to systematic errors due to imperfect subtraction.=-2    [ [ line - emission ] ] 2.2.3 .",
    "line emission + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in addition to a continuum background , ground - based observations accumulate photons from atmospheric emission in well - defined bands with many narrow emission lines ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the presence of these emission lines increases towards the ir , and their strengths vary with time .",
    "this limits the ability to study spectral features in astronomical objects at particular wavelengths .",
    "[ [ atmospheric - extinction ] ] 2.2.4 .",
    "atmospheric extinction + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    atmospheric extinction must be corrected on the basis of airmass estimates and standard star observations , to obtain absolute photometry .",
    "the accuracy with which these corrections can be done are critical for certain areas of science .",
    "the image quality depends both on the diffraction limit of the telescope ( section 2.1.2 ) and the ability of the telescope to reach this diffraction limit .",
    "[ [ strehl - ratio - sr ] ] 2.3.1 .",
    "strehl ratio ( sr ) + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the sr is the ratio of the peak flux in the normalized point - spread function ( psf ) to that for a diffraction limited system . it",
    "( and other measures of image quality ) describe the extent to which the light is concentrated in the psf core as opposed to the wings .",
    "a space - based telescope is typically designed to be diffraction limited ( commonly defined as @xmath7% ) , at some target wavelength driven by the science . by contrast",
    ", large ground - based telescopes need an ao system that aims to optimize a combination of the complimentary goals of high sr and large field of view ( see sections  [ s : aotypes ] and  [ s : contrast ] ) .",
    "even when an ao system achieves a diffraction - limed core , a low sr can severely limit the science .",
    "for example , in a crowded field the psf wings of bright stars create an elevated background that drowns out the light of fainter stars .",
    "[ [ field - of - view - fov ] ] 2.3.2 .",
    "field of view ( fov ) + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the fov sizes for space- and ground - based telescopes are both limited by technological , design , and cost constraints related to their optics and detectors .",
    "however , for ground - based observations the fov is further limited by the area over which ao correction is possible ( see section  [ s : aotypes ] ) .",
    "this limits the ability to do certain kinds of science , e.g , wide area surveys at high - resolution .",
    "[ [ stability ] ] 2.3.3 .",
    "stability + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    another advantage of space observations is the long - term stability of the environment , with no gravity , no seismic disturbances , no weather , and generally smaller thermal fluctuations . as a result ,",
    "the psf and optical geometric distortions are extremely stable .",
    "this makes the space - environment uniquely suited for science that requires high photometric or geometric precision .",
    "absolute photometry is possible from space to levels around @xmath8 mag , and relative differential photometry to levels of order @xmath9 mag .",
    "the latter is critical for photometric variation studies such as for planet transits ( as in the kepler mission ) .",
    "the photometric quality for ground - based ao is limited by temporal and spatial ( field - dependent ) psf variations , which become more significant for decreasing wavelength and increasing field size . in the near - ir , current accuracies of @xmath10 mag ( e.g. , davidge et al .",
    "2003 ; vacca et al .",
    "2007 ) can likely be reduced to near space quality with the advent of , e.g. , mcao systems ( see section  [ s : aotypes ] ) .",
    "ground - based ao observations ( e.g. , for the galactic center ) and space - based observations ( e.g. , for globular cluster stars ) have both produced superb proper motions results , with the former benefitting from the small diffraction - limited core , and the latter from the exquisite geometric stability over large time baselines.=-2      [ [ time - sampling ] ] 2.4.1 .",
    "time sampling + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one other obvious advantage of space , and in particular the l2 sun - earth lagrange point , is that there is no day - night cycle ( this does not apply to low - earth orbit satellites such as hst ) . from l2 it is possible to continuously follow time - variable phenomena and to take continuous deep exposures , without the need to compare or co - add data from different nights during which observing conditions may have been different .",
    "[ [ sky - coverage ] ] 2.4.2 .",
    "sky coverage + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    ao observations require bright guide stars to correct for atmospheric turbulence . with natural guide stars ( ngss ) ,",
    "only @xmath11% of the sky is accessible depending on the galactic latitude , for k - band imaging at moderate strehl ratios ( @xmath12% ; frogel et al .",
    "this limitation has now been mostly overcome through the use of laser guide stars ( lgss ) .",
    "however , even with an lgs system the sky coverage is not complete , since it still requires an ngs for the tip - tilt correction ( although this ngs can be several magnitudes fainter than for a pure ngs system ) .",
    "in general , sky coverage drops with increasing sr and galactic latitude .",
    "for example , nfiraos on tmt is expected to cover @xmath13 at the galactic pole ( ellerbroek , priv .",
    "comm . ) and up to 100% at low galactic latitude .",
    "projects and proposals exist to improve sky coverage further using various techniques , both on tmt and on smaller telescopes ( e.g. , keck , cfht ) .",
    "the limitations imposed by atmospheric turbulence can be characterized by the fried diameter @xmath14 , turbulence lifetime @xmath15 , and isoplanetic angle @xmath16 .",
    "all are proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "for example , typical magnitudes for a good groundbased site are @xmath18 cm , @xmath19 ms , and @xmath20 at 5000 and @xmath21 cm , @xmath22 ms , and @xmath23 at @xmath24 m .    for a given sr ,",
    "the number of subapertures that must be corrected is proportional to @xmath25 in a time interval @xmath15 .",
    "consequently the technology challenges of both applying a sufficiently high fidelity wavefront correction , and making a sufficiently accurate wavefront measurement within a turbulent cell of scale length @xmath14 in a time interval @xmath15 are much more manageable for ao corrections in the near - ir than at optical wavelengths .",
    "the number of photons required for a constant level of correction is roughly @xmath26 ( the @xmath27 comes from the area of the subaperture and time scale over which a given number of photons are required ; the @xmath28 comes from the need to achieve the same path error expressed in waves ) .",
    "hence , lower wavelengths require much larger laser power for wavefront sensing.=-2    today , ao for near - ir observations is in routine operation on the keck , vlt , gemini and other telescopes .",
    "a detailed overview of current ao capabilities was provided by frogel et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) , together with a roadmap for future development .",
    "they found that both ao performance and the number of ao - enabled refereed science papers has grown steadily over the last five years .",
    "we discuss the various types of ao in turn below .",
    "[ [ classical - ao ] ] classical ao + + + + + + + + + + + +    in classical ao , a single guide star , either natural ( ngs ) or laser ( lgs ) , is used to measure the deformations of the incoming wavefront with a wavefront - sensor and to correct them with the help of a single deformable mirror ( dm ) . in this case",
    "the fov is limited to a few times the isoplanetic angle @xmath16 . since @xmath29 for @xmath30",
    "m , this is an important limit for many scientific applications .",
    "one limitation of classical ao with an lgs is the so - called called `` cone effect '' .",
    "this results from the incomplete sampling of the turbulence in front of the aperture due to the finite distance of the lgs .",
    "this becomes increasingly problematic for larger telescope diameters and shorter wavelengths .",
    "[ [ ltao ] ] ltao + + + +    in laser tomography adaptive optics ( ltao ) , multiple lgss and wavefront sensors are used to measure the full volume of turbulence above the telescope in order to solve for the cone effect and operate a single conjugate deformable mirror , as in classical ao .",
    "this is what is planned for visible 10m - class ao systems , and for near - ir first light use on 30m - class ground - based telescopes such as the tmt .",
    "the sr will range from 0.3 at @xmath31 m to 0.8 at @xmath32 m over a fov of about @xmath33 , with a technical fov for guide star acquisition of @xmath34 .",
    "the short wave cutoff for science will be @xmath35 m , where one might still expect a diffraction limited core at very low sr ( ellerbroek , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "[ [ mcao ] ] mcao + + + +    an exciting recent advance has been the advent of multi - conjugate adaptive optics ( mcao ) , in which multiple dms are optically conjugated at different altitudes .",
    "multiple wavefront sensors use lgss to tomographically measure and compensate for turbulence - induced phase aberrations in three dimensions .",
    "this new technique increases the compensated fov , provides a more uniform psf over the field , and also solves for the `` cone effect '' .",
    "the solar community has been using mcao to deliver arc - minute scale , fully corrected near - ir images of the solar granulation .",
    "a demonstrator at the eso / vlt has delivered stable arc - minute scale images with @xmath36% psf variations .",
    "the first mcao on gemini will deliver nearly - uniform performance over a @xmath34 fov with sr ranging from 45% to 80% from 1@xmath37 m .",
    "[ [ glao ] ] glao + + + +    ground - layer adaptive optics ( glao ) is a `` lite '' form of mcao , in which only the ground - layer turbulence is corrected .",
    "this technique does not provide the same image quality improvement as mcao .",
    "it is therefore sometimes referred to as `` seeing enhancement '' , with fwhm improvements of a factor of a few .",
    "however , the technique offers the advantage of a large fov ( up to several arcmin ) .",

    "we should see these technologies ( and others pursued on , e.g. , cfht / vasao and palomar / palm3k ) move to large ground - based telescopes , as the cost - effectiveness of high - density dms and high - power lasers improve ( e.g. , dekany et al .",
    "however , the delivered srs will always decrease strongly towards lower wavelengths .",
    "moreover , the technological challenges to extend the fov remain enormous . because the guide star brightness requirement scales with @xmath39 ,",
    "challenging amounts of laser power will be necessary for visible ao ( independent of @xmath4 ) .",
    "solutions exist to mitigate these power requirements , for example using predictive control or uplink correction ( gavel et al .",
