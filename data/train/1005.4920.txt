    "<S> pulse splitting is a crucial and common process in nonlinear fiber optics . when an intense laser pulse is launched into a highly nonlinear fiber , a stream of fundamental solitons is generated , their temporal separations increasing during propagation . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the onset of a variety of perturbations , including higher - order dispersion and the raman effect . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it has been experimentally observed that the well - known law determining the amplitudes and the temporal widths of each soliton , however , breaks down due to the unexpected formation of metastable 2-peak localised states with constant temporal separation between the two maxima . in the vicinity of certain magic input powers the formation of 2-peak states is quite common in many types of highly nonlinear photonic crystal fibers . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a full theoretical understanding of the above recent observations . based on a gravity - like potential approach </S>",
    "<S> we derive simple equations for the magic peak power ratio and the temporal separation between pulses forming these 2-peak states . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a model to calculate the magic input power of the input pulse around which the phenomenon can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict the existence of exotic multipeak states that strongly violate the perturbative pulse splitting law , and we study their stability and excitation conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> pulse splitting is a well - known process occurring in the very initial moments of pulse propagation in nonlinear optical fibers @xcite . according to the most accredited theory of pulse splitting @xcite , in the femtosecond regime , </S>",
    "<S> higher - order solitons are affected by stimulated raman scattering ( srs ) and higher - order dispersion terms , becoming unstable and eventually breaking up into several fundamental solitons . </S>",
    "<S> explicit expressions for the peak power @xmath0 and temporal width @xmath1 of the @xmath2-th fundamental soliton created in the splitting process are given by ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the peak power and temporal width of the initial hyperbolic secant pulse and @xmath7 is the so - called soliton order , see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . after splitting , </S>",
    "<S> intrapulse srs causes fundamental solitons to shift continuously to lower frequencies via the raman soliton self - frequency shift ( rsfs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of rsfs is proportional to @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , pulse splitting together with rsfs eventually leads to the complete breakup of a higher - order soliton , which ejects a stream of fundamental solitons one after another . according to eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ power]-[width ] ) , solitons that are ejected earlier have higher amplitudes , shorter duration , and , as a result , demonstrate stronger rsfs . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a sequence of fundamental solitons with different carrier frequencies , which constantly increase their temporal separations during propagation due to the rsfs - induced walk - off effect .    </S>",
    "<S> however , this well - known description ignores some processes that could affect the soliton dynamics , such as interaction between solitons , and the emission of dispersive wave radiation near a zero group - velocity dispersion ( gvd ) point . in a series of recent experiments ( see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , short and intense pulses have been launched in highly nonlinear photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs , see also ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the unexpected formation of long - lived , 2-peak soliton states for specific magic input pulse energies was observed @xcite . in these experiments , it was clear that this phenomenon is quite universal for a large variety of highly nonlinear optical fibers , especially in the deep anomalous gvd regime far from zero gvd points . </S>",
    "<S> such localised states always show peaks of differing amplitude with a well - defined peak power ratio ( @xmath9 in the mentioned experiments ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the temporal separation between the two peaks is also uniquely determined by @xmath10 and the raman parameter @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , under certain circumstances a pair of solitons with unequal amplitudes can form a localised state , which can propagate over long distances even in the presence of raman effect .    </S>",
    "<S> such soliton states were numerically discovered and studied in 1996 by akhmediev _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> single peak and 2-peak states were found by solving the simplified nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) , see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nlse ] ) - ( [ gagnon ] ) below . the analysis in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is limited to two aspects : ( i ) finding the localized 2-peak solutions of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gagnon ] ) , and ( ii ) the question of numerical stability of such solutions .    in this paper , inspired by the recent experimental observation of the raman multipeak states in refs </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and by the early numerical findings in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we investigate the issue of raman multipeak states in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we propose qualitative and quantitative explanations for all the experimental observations , based on the powerful concept of gravity - like potential introduced in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the general point - of - view introduced by our approach allows one to make several important predictions to be tested in future experiments , namely the possibility of forming raman soliton states with more than two peaks in pcfs , thus leading to a complete violation of the soliton splitting law of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ power]-[width ] ) , and to new ways to manipulate scg in microstructured fibers by controlling exotic states of light in the fiber . </S>"
