    "these systems exhibit cometary morphologies with long tails , and emit broadband synchrotron radiation from radio to x - rays ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "as compared to pwne within snrs , bow - shocks are governed by simpler boundary conditions , therefore , providing a powerful probe of the local ism environment .",
    "at radio frequencies , pwne generally show a larger extent than their x - ray counterparts , due to long synchrotron cooling timescale of radio - emitting particles , which can be up to @xmath4@xmath5yr . therefore , radio pwne can act as direct calorimeters to reflect the integrated history of the systems .",

    "radio observations of pwne also reveal the nebular magnetic field structure via polarimetry .",
    "previous studies indicate a diverse @xmath6-field configuration among bow - shock pwne , from a helical field perpendicular to the tail @xcite to a @xmath6-field parallel to the tail @xcite , but the origin of the variation remains a puzzle .",

    "based on the lack of an ir counterpart , @xcite concluded that the radio emission is nonthermal and the source is an snr . in this case",
    ", we suggested that the highly unusual linear feature is due to the trailing relativistic wind of a fast pulsar moving outward from the central birth place .",

    "the polarized emission generally follows the total intensity , except across the kink , where it shows a slight depolarization .",
    "we estimate that the polarization fraction is up to @xmath240% and @xmath250% at 6 and 3 cm , respectively .",
    "a reduced polarization fraction at lower frequency has been observed in other sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and it could be attributed to beam depolarization . however , we note that these values are rough estimates due to high background .",
    "also , variations in polarization angle could shift power in the polarized image into smaller scales , to which the interferometric observations are more sensitive ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "we performed monte carlo simulations to quantify the probability of chance association .",

    "2012 , in preparation ) and found that at this sky position , an average of 0.2 field radio pulsars are expected within 20  from the shell , younger than @xmath5yr and with a radio flux larger than that of psr  j1437@xmath05959 .",
    "if we further require the pulsar s projected motion in the past to intercept any part of the shell , then the number greatly reduces to 0.0012 , therefore , strongly suggesting an association between psr  j1437@xmath05959and the frying pan .",
    "although the tail does not point toward the exact geometry center of the shell , this is not uncommon and could be the result of asymmetric supernova explosion , the progenitor s proper motion , or a slight gradient in the ism density ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to estimate the kinematics of the system , we extrapolate the tail inside the shell and take the closest approach to the center as the supernova site , which is 145 away from the pulsar location .",
    "this implies a distance @xmath32 cm traveled by the pulsar since birth , at the source distance of @xmath33kpc . here",
    "we assume the pulsar motion lies in the plane of the sky for simplicity .",
    "the pulsar velocity @xmath34 and age @xmath35 are then related by @xmath36 .",
    "even if the pulsar travels as fast as 2000kms@xmath1 , the system would still be older than 15kyr , such that g315.9@xmath00.0  has long passed the free expansion phase .",
    "on the other hand , the transition from the sedov phase to the snowplow phase occurs at @xmath37kyr with a shell radius @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the supernova explosion energy in units of @xmath40erg and @xmath41 is the ism number density in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "our observed shell radius of 7  gives a physical size @xmath42pc , slightly smaller than @xmath43 for the typical values of @xmath44 and @xmath41 between 0.1 and 1 .",

    "the bow - shock stand - off distance @xmath48 ahead of the pwn is determined by the ram pressure balance between the pulsar wind and the ism . for isotropic wind ,",
    "@xmath49 assuming a constant @xmath47 across the field , we can solve equations ( [ eqt : snr ] ) and ( [ eqt : pwn ] ) to obtain @xmath50 this corresponds to an angular scale @xmath51 , too small to be resolved by the observations .",
    "it is interesting to note that this value is independent of the system age , pulsar velocity and ambient density .",
    "also , it is one of the smallest stand - off distances among bow - shock pwne , e.g. , an order of magnitude smaller than that of the mouse @xcite .",
    "this indicates either a very large mach number or a very dense ambient medium .",
    "we argue that the latter case is less likely , since the co map @xcite shows no evidence of molecular clouds in the region .",
    "as mentioned , there is a marginal detection of a compact feature at the tip of the pwn with a flux density @xmath31jy at 6 cm .",
    "if this is from the pulsar , then comparing to the pulsed flux density of 75@xmath52jy at 20 cm @xcite indicate a rather flat radio spectrum . as an alternative",
    ", this could also be the surface of the backward termination shock , which has an extent of @xmath53 according to hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , such a small - scale structure would not be resolved in our images .",
    "further observations with high time resolution could distinguish between these cases .",
    "finally , we note that the pwn half - width near the tip is about 40@xmath48 , much greater than the value found in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations @xcite",
    ". the discrepancy could possibly be due to anisotropy of the pulsar wind or mass loading through contamination ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming cosmic abundances , we substitute @xmath48 into equation  ( [ eqt : pwn ] ) to obtain @xmath54 and hence @xmath55 while we argue above that @xmath41",

    "this indicates @xmath56 , providing support to the sedov phase for the snr .",
    "we also note that the age estimate is much younger than the pulsar s characteristic age of 110kyr , which could be reconciled if the pulsar was born with a spin period close to the present - day value ( see * ? ? ?",

    ", we can estimate the pressure @xmath57 at the head of the bow shock and the pulsar mach number @xmath58 using @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ambient pressure and @xmath61 is the ism adiabatic index . since different phases of the ism",

    "* ) , the inferred mach number would be even higher .",
    "while such a highly supersonic motion is expected to produce a very sharp mach cone with a small half - opening angle @xmath67 , the observed width of the tail increases from 6  to 60  over its entire length of 7 , implying @xmath68 .",
    "the discrepancy could be the result of overpressure in the tail , such that @xmath69 see section [ sect : pressure ] below for further discussion .",
    "figure  [ fig : pl ] shows a kink in the tail at 1  from the pulsar .",
    "we argue that this is unlikely caused by flow instability or by a global ism pressure gradient , since the magnetic field is highly ordered across the kink and the tail resumes its original orientation further downstream . instead , it could be the result of interstellar turbulence . comparing the kink s 6-lateral displacement to its 1-separation from the pulsar",

    "both the frying pan handle and the mouse have a very similar magnetic field geometry that runs parallel to the tail @xcite , while g319.9@xmath00.7 shows a @xmath6-field perpendicular to the tail @xcite .",
    "the origin of this diversity is unclear .",
    "it may depend on the pulsar spin orientation relative to its motion or the flow condition of the system . in the regime of high postshock flow speed",
    ", the magnetic field may be sheared by the flow so that the field lines are stretched along the tail .",
    "more examples are needed to verify this picture .",
    "finally , we note that the polarization vectors in both the mouse and g319.9@xmath00.7 exhibit abrupt switches at large distances from the pulsar @xcite , which is not observed here .",
    "therefore , we believe that this is not a universal feature among long pulsar tail .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a detailed radio study focusing on the handle of the frying pan snr ( g315.9@xmath00.0 ) using atca and most observations .",
    "our results confirm the 20pc - long protrusion as a bow - shock pwn associated with psr  j1437@xmath05959 .",
    "the detection of both the pwn and the parent snr makes this system a powerful probe of the pulsar environment .",
    "the very small bow - shock stand off distance of 0.002pc we deduced implies a large pulsar velocity over 1000kms@xmath1  and a high mach number @xmath2200 .",
    "the pwn has a highly ordered magnetic field that runs parallel to the tail orientation and has an average strength @xmath220@xmath52 g .",
    "based on the pressure estimate and the tail s opening angle , we found some hints of a small magnetization in the postshock wind of the order of 0.010.1 .",
    "also , the ions in the wind could be less energetic than the electrons and positrons . finally , we suggest that the kink observed in the tail is a result of supersonic ism turbulence .    as a caveat ,",
    "the main uncertainties in our derived quantities come from the distance estimate .",
    "it is not uncommon for dispersion measure - based distances to be off by 25% or more . while we may have to wait for the square kilometer array for a direct distance measurement with parallax @xcite , multiwavelength studies are essential to further understand the physics of this remarkable system . in particular",
    ", x - rays observations can provide a complementary picture of the particle energetics and reveal the flow structure of the highest energy particles .",
    "if tev emission is detected , as in other pwne , a joint modeling of the synchrotron and inverse compton scattering emissions can give an accurate measurement of the magnetic field strength .",
    "for a pulsar space velocity of 2000kms@xmath1 , a direct proper motion measurement with the atca would require a time span over 10yr .",
    "therefore , other techniques , such as vey long baseline interfermometry or timing observations , would be more practical . the latter is also essential for a deeper search of @xmath15-ray pulsations in future _ fermi _ data .",
    "we thank the referee for careful reading and useful comments .",
    "we thank gemma anderson to help carry out the 2009 june atca observations .",
    "the australia telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
