    "higher - twist parton distributions are conceptually very interesting as they go beyond the simple parton model description and allow one to quantify correlations between the partons .",
    "unfortunately , they prove to be very elusive . despite considerable efforts ,",
    "very little is known even about the simplest , twist - three distributions which contribute , e.g. structure function @xmath2 in the polarized deep - inelastic scattering @xcite and transverse single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) in the collinear factorization approach @xcite .",
    "one general reason for this is that the structure of higher twist parton distributions is much more complicated compared to the leading twist : they are functions of two and more parton momentum fractions .",
    "the usual strategy to extract parton distributions from experimental data has been to assume a certain functional form with a few adjustable parameters at a reference scale , and find the parameters by making global fits to the available data .",
    "this is a standard approach which works quite well for the leading twist .",
    "unfortunately , it does not work for higher twist ( or , at least , has not been applied systematically ) because there is no physical intuition on how such distributions may look like .",
    "also the asymptotic behavior of higher - twist distributions both at small and large @xmath3 is poorly understood .",
    "hence it is very hard to guess an adequate parametrization .    in this work",
    "we make a step in this direction .",
    "recall that the case of higher - twist parton distributions is not unique in that they are functions of several kinematic variables : in studies of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) or `` unintegrated '' transverse - momentum dependent distributions ( tmds ) the same complication arises . in both cases , representations in terms of overlap integrals of light - cone wave functions have been extremely useful for developing the underlying physics picture and provide one with a good basis for theoretical modelling . in what follows",
    "we try to follow the same path for the construction of higher - twist distributions as overlap integrals between fock states with the minimum ( valence ) and next - to - minimum ( one extra gluon ) parton content .    in order to keep the model as simple as possible , in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to contributions of the states with total zero angular momentum .",
    "we overtake the expressions for three - quark wave functions from ref .",
    "@xcite which have been shown @xcite to provide one with a good description for quark parton densities at large @xmath3 and the nucleon magnetic form factor .",
    "the new contribution of this paper is to include into consideration the fock states with one additional gluon which were considered in  @xcite on a qualitative level .",
    "we find that there exist three independent @xmath1 wave functions with zero orbital momentum .",
    "our analysis of their symmetry properties does not agree with earlier results  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the normalization of these new wave functions using qcd sum rule approach and construct explicit models by the requirement that their light - cone limit ( zero transverse separation ) reproduces the nucleon twist-4 distribution amplitudes introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "having specified the wave functions , we calculate the quark and gluon polarized and unpolarized parton distributions and find agreement with the existing parametrizations at large @xmath3 without any fine - tuning of the parameters .",
    "encouraged by this , we construct the twist - three correlation function involving a quark , antiquark and gluon fields which is relevant for the structure function @xmath2 and single spin asymmetries . in our model",
    "this correlation function vanishes at the boundaries of parton regions where one of the momentum fractions goes to zero , but non - zero values are obtained at higher scales perturbatively through the qcd evolution .",
    "this phenomenon is in full analogy to the generation of a large gluon parton distribution at small @xmath3 starting from the `` valence''-like ansatz in the grv approach  @xcite .",
    "such , radiatively generated , soft - gluon pole and soft - fermion pole contributions to the spin asymmetries are calculated and compared to the existing parametrizations .",
    "the sign of radiatively generated soft pole terms as well as the sign of the twist - three contribution to the structure function @xmath2 at large @xmath3 are largely model - independent predictions of our approach ; these signs turn out to be in agreement with the data in all cases .",
    "finally , we discuss possible generalizations of our simple model that may provide one with usable parametrizations for the phenomenological analysis .",

    "the advantage of using the higher scale is that we have been able to use qcd perturbation theory and operator product expansion to get some insight in the structure of the lowest fock states , but the price to pay is that the nucleon at the scale 1  gev already contains significant admixture of yet higher states , with several gluons and quark - antiquark pairs , which we do not know much about .",
    "these additional contributions are not taken into account in this work , and this is the reason that we underestimate parton distributions at small @xmath3 , cf .",
    "[ fig : pd ] .",

    "in what follows we show the results corresponding to the evolution of our model twist - three parton distribution from @xmath366  gev@xmath166 to an _ ad hoc _  scale @xmath367  gev@xmath166 .",
    "this calculation should be considered as an illustration , since effects of the qcd evolution from the grv scale @xmath363  gev@xmath166 are , generally , much larger .    as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : tdfd ] we show the the quark - antiquark - gluon twist - three correlation function @xmath368 ( with opposite sign ) at the model scale @xmath369  gev@xmath166 ( left ) and after the evolution to @xmath370  gev@xmath166 ( right ) .",
    "as already mentioned above , in our model ( left picture ) this correlation function is only nonzero in the two left - most triangle regions corresponding to emission and subsequent absorption of the ( valence ) quark .",
    "the upper and the lower triangles corresponds to gluon emission and absorption , respectively .",
    "the longest diagonals of the hexagon , connecting diametrically opposite vertices , correspond to vanishing of one of the parton momentum fractions .",
    "in particular , on the horizontal diagonal @xmath361 , i.e. it corresponds to the sgp kinematics , and on the other two diagonals either @xmath371 or @xmath372 , so they stand for the sfps .",

    "[ fig : t3pd ] where a gluon is emitted and a quark - antiquark pair is absorbed ( or vice versa ) .",
    "these contributions are thus analogous to the so - called erbl regions in off - forward parton distributions and , formally , are of higher order in the fock expansion .",
    "finally , the two right - most triangles correspond to the antiquark distributions .    once the qcd evolution is taken into account , different parton regions get mixed .",
    "in particular the gap between the @xmath289 and @xmath373 regions gets closed and the sgp term appears , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tdfd ] ( right picture ) .",
    "the sfp terms are also generated , but remain very small because the corresponding terms in the evolution equations are @xmath374 suppressed .",

    "[ fig : sp ] and compared there with the results of phenomenological studies of spin asymmetries in high transverse momentum meson production in @xmath376 colisions  @xcite .",
    "our distributions are of the same sign and similar shape compared to these studies , but about one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "it is plausible that much larger sgp contributions can be generated from the similar valence - like ansatz if the qcd evolution is started at a low scale of the order of @xmath363  gev@xmath166  @xcite .",
    "the sfp contributions that we obtain in this exercise appear to be two orders of magnitude below the estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite , albeit with the correct sign .",
    "it is unlikely that such large contributions can be obtained radiatively starting from the valence - like ansatz , unless one assumes the existence of antiquarks with large momentum fraction at low scales in the proton wf .",
    "in this work we explored the possibility to construct higher - twist parton distributions in a nucleon at some low reference scale from convolution integrals of the light - cone wave functions .    to this end",
    "we have studied the general structure and introduced simple models for the four - particle nucleon lcwfs involving three valence quarks and a gluon with total orbital momentum zero , and estimated their normalization ( wf at the origin ) using qcd sum rules .",
    "we have shown that truncating the fock expansion at this order , that is taking into account valence three - quark configuration and those with one additional gluon , provides one with a reasonable description of both polarized and unpolarized parton densities at large values of bjorken variable @xmath0 .    using this set of lcwfs ,",
    "twist - three quark - antiquark - gluon parton distributions have been constructed as convolution integrals of @xmath1 and valence three - quark components , which enter the description of many hard reactions in qcd in the framework of collinear factorization . in particular",
    "the twist - three contribution to the polarized structure function @xmath2 is given by a certain integral of the three - particle distribution over the parton momentum fractions , and thus is a measure of its `` global '' properties .",
    "our calculation correctly reproduces the sign and the order of magnitude of the twist-3 term at large @xmath3 , without free parameters .",
    "transverse single spin asymmetries , on the other hand , are sensitive to `` local '' properties of the three - particle correlation functions in specific configurations where one of the momentum fractions vanishes .",
    "since our approximation for the nucleon wave function only includes a few lowest fock components , and since the lcwf of each fock state vanishes whenever momentum fraction of any parton goes to zero , both `` soft gluon pole '' and `` soft fermion pole '' terms vanish at the scale where the model is formulated .",
    "they are , however , generated by qcd evolution that brings in multiple soft gluon emission .",
    "our results suggest that realistic dynamical models of the the twist - three distributions ( and the pole terms ) can be obtained following the grv - like approach on the level of wfs , i.e. assuming that the nucleon state at a very low scale can be described in terms of a few fock components , including the valence quarks , one additional gluon and , probably , a quark - antiquark pair , and applying qcd evolution equations .",
    "an obvious problem with this strategy is that the starting scale has to be chosen very low , of the order of @xmath363  gev@xmath166  @xcite , and thus the modelling of the wave functions necessarily becomes purely phenomenological . in spite of this , and the usual criticism of the application of perturbative qcd evolution equations at very low scales , we believe that such an approach has good chances to provide us with some intuition on the structure of higher - twist parton distributions in general , which is currently not available .",
    "this work is in progress and the results will be published elsewhere .",

    "<S> we explore the possibility to construct higher - twist parton distributions in a nucleon at some low reference scale from convolution integrals of the light - cone wave functions ( wfs ) . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we introduce simple models for the four - particle nucleon wfs involving three valence quarks and a gluon with total orbital momentum zero , and estimate their normalization ( wf at the origin ) using qcd sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these wfs provide one with a reasonable description of both polarized and unpolarized gluon parton densities at large values of bjorken variable @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> twist - three parton distributions are then constructed as convolution integrals of @xmath1 and usual three - quark wfs . </S>",
    "<S> the cases of the polarized structure function @xmath2 and single transverse spin asymmetries are considered in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the so - called gluon - pole contribution to twist - three distributions relevant for single spin asymmetry vanishes in this model , but is generated perturbatively at higher scales by the evolution , in the spirit of grv parton distributions . </S>"
