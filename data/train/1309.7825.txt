    "observations of emission lines in active galaxies point to the presence of photoionized gas in a wide range of radii , ionization states , gas densities and velocities .",
    "the radii @xmath9 , h nuclei densities @xmath10 , and velocities @xmath11 seem to be strongly coupled , with dense @xmath12 and fast @xmath13 ionized gas appearing on sub - pc scales ( the broad line region , or blr ) , while lower @xmath14 and lower @xmath15 ionized gas appears at scales of tens of parsecs to several kiloparsecs ( the narrow line region , or nlr ) . in some low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , an intermediate region with @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "is also observed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this decrease of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with increasing @xmath9 seems to appear also within specific regions .",
    "resolved observations of the nlr show @xmath10 increases towards the nucleus ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while the unresolved intermediate line region shows an increase of @xmath10 with @xmath11 ( see @xcite and citations thereafter ) .",
    "an association of @xmath11 with @xmath9 is expected if the gas kinematics near the center are dominated by the black hole gravity , but what causes the association of @xmath10 with @xmath9 ?    on the other hand , the large scale stratification seen in @xmath10 is not observed in the ionization state .",
    "quite the contrary is true  in both the nlr and the blr ions from a wide range of ionization potentials ( ip ) are commonly observed , including narrow lines of  ( ip=10ev ) ,  ( ip=35ev ) ,  ( 97ev ) ,  ( 234ev ) , and broad lines of  ( 8ev ) ,  ( 48ev ) ,   ( 114ev ) and  ( 207ev ) .",
    "moreover , resolved maps of emission lines with widely different ip indicate that the high ionization gas and low ionization gas are co - spatial .",
    "a strong spatial correlation is seen between the high ip extended x - ray line emission and the relatively low ip  emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a similar correlation is also seen between the optical and near infrared high ip emission and the  emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the co - spatiality of the high ionization and low ionization gas suggests a common origin of these two components .    also , in mid infrared emission lines , where extinction effects are minimal , high ip and low ip lines exhibit a very small dispersion in their luminosity ratios",
    "the @xmath18}}~14.32{\\,\\mbox{$\\mu$m}}$ ] , @xmath19}}~25.89{\\,\\mbox{$\\mu$m}}$ ] and @xmath20}}~15.55{\\,\\mbox{$\\mu$m}}$ ] emission lines have ips of 97ev , 55ev  and 41ev  respectively , but the dispersion in their luminosity ratios between different objects is @xmath21 dex ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this small dispersion also suggests a common origin for the low ionization and high ionization gas . why is low ionization gas always accompanied by high ionization gas , and vice - versa ?    a possible physical source of the characteristics mentioned above is the mechanism which confines the ionized layer of the illuminated gas . on the back side , beyond the ionization front",
    ", cool dense gas can supply the confinement .",
    "however , an optically thin confining mechanism is required at the illuminated surface .",
    "several optically thin confining mechanisms have been suggested for the ionized gas in agn , usually for a specific region .",
    "a hot low @xmath10 medium in pressure equilibrium with cooler line - emitting gas has been proposed for the blr ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and for the nlr ( @xcite ) .",
    "other proposed confining mechanisms include a low density wind striking the face of the gas ( e.g. @xcite ) , and a magnetic field permeating the intercloud medium ( @xcite and @xcite for the blr ; @xcite for the nlr ) .",
    "most of the above suggestions require an additional component for confining the gas , implying that the gas pressure is an independent free parameter .    however , one source of confinement is inevitable in a hydrostatic solution , and incurs no additional free parameters .",
    "photoionization must be associated with momentum transfer from the radiation to the gas .",
    "thus , the pressure of the incident radiation itself can confine the ionized layer of the illuminated gas , without requiring any additional components . in this simpler scenario , where the gas is radiation pressure confined ( rpc ) , the gas pressure is set by the flux of the incident radiation .",
    "@xcite ( 2002 , hereafter d02 ) , @xcite , and @xcite ( 2004b , hereafter g04 ) showed that the gas pressure in the nlr gas is likely dominated by radiation pressure .",
    "they derived a slab structure where the ionization decreases with depth , which implies a common source for low ip and high ip emission lines .",
    "also , this slab structure implies that the low ionization layer sees an absorbed spectrum , as observed in some nearby agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "building on the work of d02 and g04 , we show that in rpc the same slab of gas which emits the low ionization emission lines can have a highly ionized surface which emits x - rays lines .",
    "we show that because the gas pressure is not an independent parameter , this slab structure is unique over a large range of @xmath9 and other model parameters .",
    "this specific structure is likely responsible for the tight relation between the low ip emission lines and the high ip lines observed in the x - ray , optical and ir .",
    "if the ionized gas is rpc , then the pressure at the ionization front , where most of the ionizing radiation is absorbed , equals the incident radiation pressure , which is @xmath22 .",
    "since the temperature near the ionization front is @xmath23 , rpc implies @xmath24 .",
    "we show below that this @xmath24 relation quantitatively reproduces the decrease of @xmath10 with @xmath9 seen in resolved observations of the nlr , and the increase of @xmath10 with @xmath11 seen in the unresolved intermediate line region . in a companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii )",
    "we show that rpc also reproduces @xmath10 at the blr .",
    "together , these findings imply that rpc sets @xmath10 of ionized gas in active galaxies over a dynamical range of @xmath5 in @xmath9 , from sub - pc to kpc scale , and a dynamical range of @xmath6 in @xmath10 , from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "hydrostatic radiation pressure effects were also applied to models of ionized gas in star forming regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and to models of ` warm absorbers ' , i.e. ionized gas in agn detected in absorption ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is built as follows . in ",
    "2.1 we present the necessary conditions for rpc . in ",
    "2.2   2.6 , we derive several analytical results from these conditions .",
    "we use cloudy  ( @xcite ) to carry out detailed numerical calculations .",
    "the emission line emissivities vs. @xmath9 implied by rpc are presented in  2.7 . in ",
    "3 we compare the rpc calculations with available observations . in  4 , we analyze the observational and theoretical evidence for the existence of dust in the ionized gas , which has a strong effect on the structure of rpc slabs .",
    "we discuss our results and their implications in  5 , and conclude in  6 .",
    "we assume a one dimensional , hydrostatic , semi - infinite slab of gas .",
    "the slab is assumed to be moving freely in the local gravitational field , so external gravity is canceled in the slab frame of reference .",
    "the ionized layer of this slab is confined by radiation pressure if it satisfies two conditions .",
    "the first condition is that the force applied by the radiation needs to be the strongest force applied to the gas . under this condition ,",
    "the hydrostatic equation is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gas pressure , @xmath27 is the depth into the slab measured from the illuminated surface , @xmath28 is the flux of ionizing radiation at @xmath27 , and @xmath29 is the sum of the mean absorption and scattering opacity per h nucleus , weighted by the ionizing flux .",
    "we define a correction factor @xmath30 , which accounts for the additional radiative force due to the absorption of non - ionizing photons in the ionized layer , and the correction due to anisotropic scattering .",
    "we show below that for a typical agn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , @xmath31 in dust - less gas and @xmath32 in dusty gas .",
    "other sources of pressure , including magnetic pressure and the pressure of the trapped emitted radiation , are assumed to be small compared to @xmath26 .",
    "the second condition , presented by d02 , is that the radiation pressure needs to be significantly larger than the ambient pressure , i.e. , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the pressure of the ionizing radiation at the illuminated surface ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the luminosity at @xmath37 ) . for properties which are defined as a function of @xmath27 , such as @xmath26",
    ", we use a subscript ` 0 ' to denote a value of a certain variable at the illuminated surface , and a subscript ` f ' to denote a value near the ` ionization front '  the boundary between the  and  layers .    at the ionization front ,",
    "most of the ionizing radiation has been absorbed , therefore equations [ eq : hydrostatic only radiation ] and [ eq : prad > pgas ] imply that @xmath38 where we assumed that @xmath39 , so @xmath34 is not geometrically diluted with increasing @xmath27 ( see  2.6 ) .",
    "the natural units to discuss rpc is @xmath40 .",
    "this definition of @xmath41 differs from the common definition ( @xcite ) by a factor of @xmath30 , which is the natural extension for including the effect of pressure from non - ionizing radiation .",
    "also , we follow d02 and drop the factor of 2.3 in the original definition . in these units , equations [ eq : prad > pgas ] and [ eq : pgasf ] are simply @xmath42 and @xmath43      near the ionization front , @xmath44 to within a factor of @xmath45 ( e.g. @xcite ) . therefore , using @xmath46 and @xmath47 , eq .",

    ", we plot the typical ism pressure in the solar neighborhood , @xmath55 ( @xcite ) . the pressure induced by",
    "the agn radiation is stronger than the ism pressure at @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the radiation pressure of seyferts will likely have a significant effect on the ism of the whole host galaxy , while quasars can also significantly affect the pressure equilibrium in the circum - galactic medium .",

    "[ eq : n vs r ] ) for different @xmath36 ( noted in @xmath57 ) .",
    "for comparison , we plot the typical @xmath10 of the blr ( gray stripe ) , the @xmath58 of various forbidden lines ( dotted lines ) , the gravitational radius of influence for @xmath59 ( solid gray , see  [ sec : low lledd profiles ] ) , and the typical ism pressure in the solar neighborhood , in units of @xmath60 ( short dashed line ) .",
    "the agn radiation pressure is larger than the typical ism pressure at @xmath61 .",
    "since forbidden line emission drops at @xmath62 , rpc implies a stratification of line emission according to @xmath58 . in low luminosity agn",

    "[ fig : n vs r ] also shows the critical densities @xmath58 of various forbidden lines with relatively low ionization levels . for a broad distribution of @xmath10 , the emission of a certain forbidden line",

    "the low ionization levels of these lines ensure they are emitted near the ionization front , so @xmath52 is a measure of @xmath10 where these lines are emitted .",

    "[ fig : n vs r ] .",

    "[ eq : pgasf ] we get @xmath75 the numerical value of @xmath76 is appropriate for an ionizing slope of @xmath77 , as seen in luminous agn ( @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath78 is measured at the illuminated surface , before any absorption has occurred .",
    "using @xmath79 for the effective @xmath80 is reasonable , since most of the absorption occurs near the ionization front , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( see d02 and next section ) .",
    "therefore , eq . [ eq : uf ] implies that at @xmath83 rpc gas is similar to constant @xmath10 gas with an initial ionization parameter @xmath84 .",
    "this effective @xmath71 is independent of the boundary conditions @xmath53 and @xmath78 , and therefore a general property of rpc gas .",
    "the value of @xmath80 is set only by the ratio of the gas pressure per h - nucleus ( @xmath85 ) to the pressure per ionizing photon ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "[ eq : uf ] , d02 showed that in seyferts the derived values of @xmath71 and the small dispersion in @xmath71 between different objects suggests that the nlr gas is rpc . in paper ii",
