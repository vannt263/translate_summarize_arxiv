    "we note that the second line of eq.([eq : korringa ] ) is the well - kwon korringa relation @xcite in the context of nmr relaxation theory , and the first line is its extension to the case having a finite energy - level splitting @xcite .",
    "since the static susceptibility can be calculated by the exact solution , we need to evaluate the density of states @xmath42 and the self energy @xmath43 .",
    "fortunately , this can be done by exploiting the friedel sum rule .",

    "( b ) conductance on log scale : we can see distinct exponential dependence between the su(4 ) ( zero field ) and su(2 ) ( strong field ) cases in the kondo regime.,width=245 ]    when the dot - level @xmath53 is above the fermi level , the conductance is small , since the resonant tunneling does not occur .",
    "as @xmath53 goes down through the fermi level , the conductance is enhanced by the kondo effect , which is analogous to an ordinary single dot case .",
    "however , in contrast to the single dot system , for which the conductance is saturated in the kondo limit with deep @xmath53 , it continues to increase exponentially .",
    "the increase is caused by the inter - dot charge fluctuations enhanced by the inter - dot  orbital \" kondo effect @xcite .",

    "we assume that the direction of the magnetic field is parallel to spin@xmath61 .",
    "it is seen that the magnetic fields enhance the conductance , in contrast to the ordinary kondo effect in a single - dot system .",
    "the inter - dot kondo effect is caused by the degenerate energy levels in two dots , which still possess su(2 ) symmetry in strong magnetic fields .",

    "we take @xmath69 for the su(4 ) double - dot case ( zero field ) and @xmath70 for the su(2 ) double - dot case ( strong fields).,width=226 ]    the results obtained in both cases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dif ] .",
    "in contrast to the magnetic - field dependence discussed above , the conductance decreases monotonically as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "the decrease is caused by the suppression of the inter - dot kondo effect in the presence of finite energy difference @xmath29 .",
    "we note here that the ordinary  spin \" kondo effect still persists even in finite @xmath29 , giving rise to the enhanced spin fluctuations .",
    "although such enhancement in spin fluctuations may not be observed in transport properties , it should show up if we observe the nmr relaxation rate in the double - dot system .",

    "inter - dot tunneling @xmath3 ( intra- and inter - dot coulomb repulsions ) is assumed to be sufficiently small ( large ) here again .",

    ", we can calculate the conductance between two leads in the triple - dot system by the exact solution of the su(6 ) anderson model , because there are 6 available electron states including spin degrees of freedom in the three dots . in this case",

    "inter- as well as intra - dot coulomb repulsions are assumed to be sufficiently strong.,width=151 ]      transport properties for the above three - dot systems depend on how the current is observed . to be specific , we change the gate voltage attached to the dot 3 with keeping the voltage in the dots 1 and 2 fixed , and observe the conductance between the leads 1 and 2 as well as between the leads 1 and 3 .",
    "+   + the computed conductance is shown in fig . [",
    "graph : tricon](a ) as a function of the energy difference @xmath29 between the energy level in the dot 3 and those in the dots 1 and 2 .",
    "we set the sign of @xmath29 positive when the energy level in the dot 3 is higher than the others .",
    "let us first observe the current between the leads 1 and 2 .",
    "it is seen that the conductance increases with the increase of @xmath74 .",
    "this increase is attributed to the enhancement of the inter - dot kondo effect in the presence of the energy deference , which is similar to that for the double dots in magnetic fields discussed in the previous section . at @xmath75 ,",
    "the current flows via an su(6 ) kondo resonance ( i.e. 6-fold degenerate kondo resonance ) . on the other hand , for large @xmath29 , the su(4 ) kondo effect is realized within 4 lower states in the dots 1 and 2 .",
    "this gives the enhancement of the inter - dot susceptibility between the dots 1 and 2 , resulting in the increase of the conductance . according to the exact solution of the su(6 ) anderson model @xcite , the effective kondo temperature for large @xmath29",
    "is given by , @xmath76 and the corresponding conductance is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the kondo temperature for su(6 ) triple - dot systems .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath79 , the su(2 ) spin kondo effect occurs in the lower 2 levels in the dot 3 , while the spin kondo effects in the dots 1 and 2 are suppressed because the number of electrons in the dots 1 and 2 decreases ( see fig . [ graph : tricon](b ) ) .",
    "also , the inter - dot kondo effect between the dots 1 and 2 is suppressed . as a result",
    "the conductance decreases when the current is observed between leads 1 and 2 .",
    "if the current is observed between the leads 1 and 3 , distinct properties appear in the conductance . as seen from fig .",
    "[ graph : tricon](a ) , for large @xmath80 ( irrespective of its sign ) , the conductance decreases because the energy difference suppresses the inter - dot kondo effect between the dots 1 and 2 . notice that around @xmath81 , the conductance has a maximum structure , where charge fluctuations between the dots 1 and 3 are slightly enhanced .",

    ", we assume that the energy levels of three dots are same ( symmetric dots ) .",
    "the computed conductance between two leads under magnetic fields is shown in fig .",
    "[ graph : triconmag ] .",
    "the conductance increases as the zeeman splitting @xmath30 increases although the kondo effect due to spin fluctuations are suppressed by the field .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , this enhancement is caused by the inter - dot kondo effect among three dots . for large magnetic fields ,",
    "half of the internal degrees of freedom are quenched , so that the symmetry of the system changes from su(6 ) to su(3 ) . as a result , the su(3 )",
    "kondo effect caused by inter - dot charge fluctuations is enhanced , and therefore the conductance is increased .",
    "the effective kondo temperature in large fields is given as , @xmath82 and thus the conductance is enhanced like @xmath83          we can generalize our method to systems with more than three dots : a lead is attached to each dot , where the electrons feel strong intra- and inter - dot coulomb repulsions .",
    "all the dots are connected to each other via small inter - dot coupling @xmath3 .    in similar manners",
    "mentioned above , we can calculate the conductance in such multiple - dot systems .",
    "the calculation can be done by using the formula eq.([eq : conductance ] ) in the second order in tunneling @xmath3 , where all the correlation effects are incorporated through the dynamical susceptibility .",
    "we can use the exact solution of the su(@xmath84 ) anderson model @xcite for an @xmath72-dot system .",
    "the conductance shows similar properties to those observed in the double and triple dots : if we change the gate voltage of the dot @xmath21 , the conductance between the lead @xmath21 and one of the other leads is generally suppressed , while it is enhanced otherwise .    in this paper",
    "we have assumed small inter - dot coupling @xmath3 , and calculated the conductance up to @xmath85 .",
    "it should be mentioned that for a system with more than two dots , a fano - type interference effect may emerge in higher order terms in @xmath3 .",
    "this interference effect may give another interesting aspect of multiple - dot systems , which is to be studied in the future work .",
    "we have studied transport properties in the double - dot system connected in series that possesses not only intra- but also inter - dot coulomb repulsions .",
    "it has been shown that the application of the ward - takahashi identity enables us to use the exact solutions of the anderson model for calculations of the conductance at zero temperature .",
    "we have clarified how the inter - dot kondo effect affects the conductance under the gate - voltage control and the magnetic - field control . in particular , the conductance is decreased by the suppression of the inter - dot kondo effect in the gate - voltage control , whereas it is increased by the enhanced kondo effect in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the latter conclusion is consistent with the results of the numerical renormalization group .",
    "the method has also been applied to calculate the conductance in multiple - dot systems including more than two dots . by taking a triple - dot system as an example ,",
    "we have shown how the conductance is controlled by tuning the inter - dot kondo effect .",
    "naively , it seems not easy to observe the kondo effect in multiple - dot systems ( more than two dots ) experimentally .",
    "we would like to mention , however , that the kondo temperature in multiple - dot systems can be much higher than that in single - dot systems when the inter - dot repulsion is relevant , as assumed in this paper .",
    "therefore , if such multiple - dot system could be fabricated , the kondo effect may be possibly observed even in multiple - dot systems considered here .",
    "finally a comment is in order on the ordinary  spin \" kondo effect in our multiple - dot system .",
    "we have focused on the inter - dot  orbital \" kondo effect in this paper , which directly affects transport properties .",
    "concerning the spin kondo effect , the impacts of the gate voltage and the magnetic field appear differently from the inter - dot kondo effect , e.g. the magnetic field ( gate - voltage difference ) suppresses ( enhances ) the spin kondo effect .",
    "if we use the dynamical spin susceptibility instead of the pseudo - spin susceptibility , the present analysis can be straightforwardly applied to low - frequency dynamics such as the nmr relaxation rate , which may be important to discuss an application to quantum - bits in quantum computation .",
    "in fact , the expression eq.([dynamical ] ) gives the nmr relaxation rate for the double - dot system , if the dynamical susceptibility is regarded as the spin susceptibility .",
    "it is of particular interest that the nmr relaxation rate in our multiple - dot systems can be controlled by the gate voltage , e.g. the difference in the energy - levels of double dots can enhance the relaxation rate .",
