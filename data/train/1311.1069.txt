    "the description of the states that a pack of macroscopic objects can take has become an important subject of debate in physics since basic equilibrium statistical mechanics was proposed as a suitable framework to deal with this problem @xcite .",
    "it is expected that macrostates consisting of a large collection of configurations ( or microstates ) compatible with given macroscopic variables that describe the macroscopic state can be readily defined and that the preferred macrostate for the system under given constraints would be predictable as the mean of a suitable distribution of such microstates .",
    "the aforementioned collection of microstates have to be generated with a well defined protocol of repeated perturbations applied to the packing .",
    "such perturbations are necessary since macroscopic objects ( such as the grains of a granular sample ) interact through non - conservative forces ( inelastic collisions and friction ) and so dissipate all kinetic energy at the particle scale .",
    "hence , to move from one configuration to another , an external input of energy is mandatory .",
    "whether a given protocol of perturbation leads to a collection of microstates that can be defined as an equilibrium macrostate in the sense described by thermodynamics is still a matter of debate .",
    "nonetheless , there exist some consensus that in some cases this may be the case . for instance , annealed tapping protocols are known to give reproducible volumes ( and its fluctuations ) for a given tap amplitude and tap duration @xcite .",
    "however , the question remains as to what are the macroscopic variables that fully describe the macroscopic state @xcite .",
    "volume fluctuations present a controversial feature .",
    "plotted as a function of volume , fluctuations display a maximum at an intermediate volume between the maximum and minimum volume reached by the macrostates in some studies @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with results from experiments using fluidized beds @xcite ( they show a minimum in fluctuations ) and experiments with non - jammed packings @xcite ( they present a monotonic decrease of fluctuations with increasing packing fraction ) .    in this work",
    "we exploit a model recently introduced by bowles and ashwin @xcite that allows for a full analytic calculation of the density of states of a frictionless granular packing .",
    "the model has the advantage of corresponding to a realistic representation of an experimentally realizable system and then allows for a validation of the ability of the theory of ensembles to describe steady states attained by real granular samples .    under edwards proposal , in the volume ensemble , all possible configurations compatible with a given macroscopic volume are equally probable .",
    "however , the configurations sampled in the lab by using external perturbations can not be set at a prescribed volume .",
    "therefore , it is generally assumed that the collection of states generated by a repeated perturbation , after any transient has fade , should be compatible with a `` canonical ensemble '' of constant compactivity ( the analogue of temperature ) .",
    "we generate such collections of microstates by tapping at different intensities using realistic simulations of the bowles ashwin model .",
    "then , we compare the results with the prediction of the `` canonical ensemble ''",
    ".    we will show that the probability distribution of microstates generated by tapping agree with the prediction of the `` canonical ensemble '' only for intermediate tap intensities . for high and low tap intensities ,",
    "the simulation explores only a portion of the phase space available .    despite the shortcomings of the ensemble theory , this solvable model predicts a non - trivial maximum in fluctuations that can be observed in the simulations but only for the frictional case",

    "previous works using this library have shown that simulations are consistent with other more complex interaction models for granular particles @xcite .",
    "tapping is simulated by setting the initial velocity @xmath36 of the container ( originally at rest ) to a given positive value in the vertical direction . in doing so , the container , and the particles inside , moves upward and fall back on top of a zero restitution base . while the box dissipate all its kinetic energy on contacting the base , particles inside the box bounce against the box walls and floor until they fully settle . after all particles come to rest a new tap",

    "the intensity of the taps is characterized by the initial velocity imposed to the confining box at each tap ( i.e. @xmath37 ) .",

    "we initially decrease @xmath38 from about @xmath40 down to a very low value and then increase it back to its initial high value .",
    "we repeat this protocol on the sample three times . at each value of @xmath38",

    "in fig . [ phi ] , we show the mean packing fraction @xmath0 as a function of the tap intensity @xmath38 for various system widths @xmath7 for frictional and frictionless disks .",

    ", frictional disks still take volumes predicted for frictionless disks in a much prominent fashion .",

    "the assumption that tapping takes the system to a macroscopic state compatible with a bath at fixed @xmath5 is fair .",

    "ashwin model predicts a maximum in the fluctuations for a packing fraction above @xmath8 .",
    "it is clear form fig .",
    "[ fluct ] that fluctuation present a maximum for the frictional disks .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath57 , frictionless disks under tapping sample higher values of @xmath0 where a monotonic decrease in @xmath6 is predicted . for @xmath1 , frictionless disks do sample states at @xmath0 low enough for the maximum in fluctuations to be observed .",
    "although subtle , it can be seen that fluctuations grow slightly up to @xmath58 and decay quickly beyond that value .",
    "the maximum in the fluctuations has been observed previously in quasi-2d experiments of tapped granular columns @xcite .",
    "however , contrasting results have been found in 2d and 3d packings @xcite where a monotonic decay with increasing packing fraction has been observed , whereas in 3d fluidized beds a minimum in the fluctuations was reported @xcite . while dimensionality and jamming state may be the reasons behind such strong qualitative discrepancies between experiments , it is clear that in the present system , both , the analytic ensemble theory and the dem simulation of tapping agree in that a maximum in fluctuations exists .",
    "figure [ fluct ] makes apparent an additional feature of fluctuations in the case of frictional disks .",
    "different fluctuations are observed even if the mean volume of the macrostate is the same [ see parts ( b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "this has been observed before in similar systems @xcite .",
    "the implication is that the macrostates are not fully described by the volume and further macroscopic variables are needed . in refs . @xcite it was concluded that adding the force moment tensor as an extra extensive variable allowed the states to be fully described having same fluctuations if the same mean volume and mean force moment tensor where observed for two states obtained through different tap intensities and tap duration",
    "we have tested the prediction of the edwards ensemble for the bowles  ashwin model by running dem simulations of tapped columns of frictionless and frictional disks .",
    "these simulations of a realistic protocol of generating steady states for a model with analytic solution is particular suited to validate the ensemble approach to describe the statistics of static packings .",
    "one interesting finding is that fluctuations are predicted by the ensemble theory to display a maximum as a function of @xmath0 and this has been indeed observed in the simulations .    beyond the overall similarity between the theoretical and simulation results , there are clear differences that suggest the ensemble theory is unable to capture some of the response of the realistic system .",
    "in particular , the range of volumes explored through tapping is much narrower than the full range of allowed volumes .",
    "this feature akin to ergodicity breaking @xcite .",
    "tapping may condition the system to explore only a region of the phase space .",
    "however , we find that independent instances of the tapping protocol do not lead to sampling a different portion of the phase space as expected in ergodicity breaking systems such as glasses",
    ". this would imply that the flat measure in the volume ensemble proposed initially by edwards is inadequate at least for this system ( but possibly for most granular systems ) .",
    "a revision may be necessary to consider that each type of perturbation would induce the system to sample the phase space in a different way .",
