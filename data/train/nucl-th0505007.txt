    "the solar neutrino problem is one of the central issues in the neutrino physics  @xcite . the current interpretation of the solar - neutrino deficit is the neutrino oscillation induced by the mass difference among @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and their mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "attention is now focused on the determination of the oscillation parameters .",
    "the cross section of the @xmath7-capture reaction @xmath0be(@xmath1)@xmath2b at incident energy in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) frame of the @xmath7-@xmath0be system @xmath15 plays an essential role in the solar - neutrino phenomenology , since the observed flux of @xmath2b neutrino is proportional to it ; the magnitude of the cross section @xmath16 is customarily expressed by the astrophysical factor @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the sommerfeld parameter .",
    "the required accuracy of @xmath3 , to determine the neutrino oscillation parameters with sufficient accuracy , is the error within 5%  @xcite .",

    "moreover , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the uncertainty of the s - wave @xmath7-@xmath0be scattering length ( with about 50% error ) prevents one from determining @xmath3 with very high accuracy .    because of the difficulty of the direct measurement of @xmath16 at stellar energies , alternative indirect measurements were proposed .",
    "coulomb dissociation  @xcite of @xmath2b is one of such indirect measurements .",
    "so far , extraction of @xmath3 from these experiments has been based on the virtual photon theory with the assumption of @xmath2b dissociation by virtual electric dipole ( e1 ) photon absorption .",
    "nuclear interaction and absorption of quadrupole ( e2)- and multi - photons were not taken into account .",
    "the value thus extracted from the riken experiment at 52 mev / nucleon was @xmath23 ev b  @xcite . in the analysis of the msu experiment  @xcite measured at 44 and 83 mev / nucleon , the e2 contribution to one - step process was estimated from the parallel - momentum - distribution of @xmath0be fragment and subtracted from the breakup spectrum of @xmath2b . as a result ,",
    "the extracted @xmath3 was @xmath24 ev b , which is smaller than the value obtained at riken mentioned above .",
    "however , the analysis of the angular distribution of the @xmath2b breakup cross section of the riken experiment showed no contribution of e2 transitions .",
    "moreover , the recent experiment at rather high energy , 250 mev / nucleon , done at gsi  @xcite showed that the e2 contribution was negligibly small ; the resulting @xmath3 was @xmath25 ev b. even though the significance of e2 transitions can be energy - dependent , the conclusions from the msu and riken measurements at similar energies look inconsistent and roles of the e2 component are still not clear .",
    "more seriously , there exists a non - negligible discrepancy of about 15% between the values of @xmath3 mentioned above that are derived from direct @xmath7-capture and indirect @xmath2b - breakup measurements .",
    "very recently , it was shown by a semiclassical calculation of @xmath4pb(@xmath2b , @xmath5be)@xmath4pb at 52 mev / nucleon that the discrepancy mentioned above was significantly reduced by taking account of nuclear - breakup components , e2 , and higher - order coulomb breakup processes  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this result , we attempt in the present paper to extract a reliable value of @xmath3 analyzing the @xmath2b dissociation experiment measured at riken  @xcite , with the method of continuum - discretized coupled - channels  @xcite ( cdcc ) , assuming a @xmath7+@xmath26be+a three - body model of the system , where a stands for the target nucleus .",
    "the result of the analysis is then used to extract @xmath3 by means of the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) method  @xcite .",
    "cdcc has been successful in describing various processes in which effects of projectile - breakup are essential  .",

    "the wave function of @xmath2b used in the cdcc calculation is found to be consistent with the measured cross section of @xmath0be(@xmath1)@xmath2b at low energies .",
    "we then use the calculated breakup cross section and the @xmath7-@xmath0be separation energy in the @xmath2b nucleus to obtain @xmath3 by the anc method .",
    "an important advantage of the anc method is that there is no restriction of the reaction mechanisms .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty of @xmath3 due to the use of the anc method can quantitatively be evaluated  @xcite .",
    "the construction of the present paper is as follows .",
    "first , we describe how to extract the anc from the three - body model cdcc analysis of @xmath2b breakup .",
    "we show that under a condition , which is satisfied in the present analysis , the calculated cross section is proportional to the square of the anc for the ground state of @xmath2b .",
    "this is by no means trivial since the cdcc wave function contains not only the ground state of @xmath2b but also its continuum states .",
    "we describe in the later section the condition and the angular region of @xmath2b breakup in which it is satisfied .",
    "second , we determine @xmath3 from @xmath4pb(@xmath2b , @xmath5be)@xmath4pb at 52 mev / nucleon by the anc method , taking account of all order nuclear and coulomb breakup processes .",
    "it should be noted that in our cdcc calculation interference between nuclear- and coulomb - breakup amplitudes is explicitly included .",
    "we make use of the eikonal - cdcc method  @xcite ( e - cdcc ) , with some modifications , to obtain the scattering amplitudes corresponding to large values of the orbital - angular - momentum @xmath27 of relative motion between the projectile and the target nucleus .",
    "we then construct a hybrid amplitude from the results of e - cdcc and cdcc .",
    "this makes it possible to carry out very accurate analyses with high computational speed  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties of the extracted @xmath3 are carefully evaluated .",
    "finally , we discuss the contributions of nuclear breakup , e2 transitions , and higher - order processes on the extracted value of @xmath3 .",
    "the anc method is also applied to direct @xmath0be(@xmath1)@xmath2b measurement assuming the same @xmath7-@xmath0be potential in the calculation of the direct capture process as used in the cdcc analysis .",

    "we recapitulate the anc method below , partly to introduce notations . at very low incident energies ,",
    "the @xmath7-capture reaction @xmath0be(@xmath1)@xmath2b leading to the ground state of @xmath2b is extremely peripheral because of the coulomb barrier .",
    "the @xmath28-matrix element of the reaction , therefore , depends on the overlap between the ground state wave functions of @xmath0be and @xmath2b only in the tail region , where the radial part of the overlap has the following form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the range of the nuclear interaction between @xmath7 and @xmath0be of about 4 fm , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the ground state wave function of @xmath0be ( @xmath2b ) , @xmath33 is the relative momentum in the unit of @xmath34 between @xmath7 and @xmath0be , @xmath35 stands for the internal coordinates of the seven - nucleon system , and @xmath36 is the whittaker function where @xmath37 is the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath7-@xmath0be relative motion in the ground state of @xmath2b ; @xmath38 in the present case .",

    "( [ 8bwf ] ) is the anc of our interest .",
    "the cross section @xmath40 , and consequently @xmath3 , are proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "thus , one can evaluate them once the anc , @xmath39 , is known .",
    "the cross section of any reaction in which a proton is transferred to or from @xmath2b is proportional to @xmath41 in dwba if the reaction is peripheral in the sense that it takes place when the transferred proton is distant from @xmath0be more than the range @xmath30 .",
    "based on this idea , dwba analyses of proton transfer reactions such as @xmath42be(@xmath0be,@xmath2b)@xmath43be  @xcite and @xmath44n(@xmath0be,@xmath2b)@xmath45c  @xcite have successfully been made to obtain the required anc .",
    "in the present paper we analyze the data of @xmath2b elastic breakup in which the fragments @xmath0be and @xmath7 are ejected into very forward angles . for brevity",
    ", we henceforth call such a process breakup into forward angles .",
    "since the breakup in such a case takes place at large distance @xmath46 of @xmath2b from the target nucleus , it is mostly due to coulomb interaction .",
    "the operator of the interaction is proportional to @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the dominant contribution to the @xmath28 matrix is from the region of @xmath49 larger than the range of nuclear interaction @xmath30 between the fragments .",
    "this is numerically confirmed as described in sec .",
    "[ errors17 ] .",
    "the reaction , therefore , is peripheral in the sense described above .",
    "thus , the anc can be obtained if its cross section is reproduced and is shown to be proportional to @xmath41 by theory .",
    "we show in the following that the cross section is well reproduced by cdcc and is in good approximation proportional to @xmath41 in the present case .",

    "the function @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the plane wave of relative motion between a and the outgoing @xmath7 ( @xmath0be ) , and @xmath60 is the exact wave function of the system with the incident plane wave of relative motion between @xmath2b and a in the initial channel .    in the riken experiment that we analyze in the present work , emitted fragments",
    "were measured at forward angles with the @xmath0be in the ground state  @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath0be stays in its ground state in the course of @xmath2b breakup .",
    "we have confirmed the validity of this assumption by a @xmath61he+@xmath62he+@xmath4pb three - body model cdcc calculation of the scattering of @xmath0be on @xmath4pb at 52 mev / nucleon .",
    "the cross sections of non - elastic processes including breakup of @xmath0be are less than about 1% of that of elastic scattering for the scattering angle of the c.m . of @xmath0be , @xmath63 , below about @xmath64 .",

    "as one sees from eq .",
    "( [ tap ] ) , @xmath97 plays an essential role in the @xmath28-matrix element .",
    "its calculation , however , requires the wave functions of the two nuclei that are not readily available .",
    "we , therefore , substitute it by a constant @xmath98 times a physically plausible normalized function @xmath99 . in this work",
    "we take it to be a solution of @xmath100 where @xmath101 is a woods - saxon potential that is supposed to represent the single - particle potential of @xmath7 in @xmath2b .",
    "since the norm of @xmath97 is the spectroscopic factor of @xmath7 in @xmath2b , @xmath102 is its approximation if @xmath103 is close to @xmath104 .",

    "thus , in the particular case under consideration , the exact @xmath28-matrix element can approximately be calculated by three - body cdcc .",
    "furthermore , since the reaction is peripheral in @xmath49 as already mentioned , the radial part of @xmath103 in @xmath107 can be replaced by its asymptotic form @xmath108 thus , @xmath69 is approximately proportional to @xmath109 from the definitions of @xmath98 and @xmath110 , it is clear that @xmath39 is in good approximation the ratio of @xmath111 to @xmath112 , i.e. the anc of @xmath113 we look for .",
    "thus , one sees that the cross section is indeed proportional to @xmath41 .",

    "we then obtain @xmath102 by taking the ratio of the measured cross section to @xmath114 . since the amplitude @xmath110 is readily known , the anc , @xmath39 , can then be calculated by eq .",

    "this model is shown to be adequate in the breakup reaction in which the fragments @xmath7 and @xmath0be are ejected in very forward angles , less than 4@xmath273 , which is the case for the experimental data analyzed in this work .",
    "nuclear and coulomb e1 and e2 transitions and multi - step processes of all - order are included in the calculation .",
    "the calculated cross section is shown to be proportional to the squared asymptotic amplitude of the overlap of the ground state wave functions of @xmath0be and @xmath2b , which is a necessary condition for the applicability of the anc method .",
    "the cdcc calculation is made efficient by the use of the eikonal cdcc method  @xcite ( e - cdcc ) for large angular momentum partial waves .",
    "improvements of e - cdcc are made to cope with the coulomb distortions of the incident and scattered waves of relative motion and intrinsic spins of the projectile and the ejectiles .",
    "the main source of the error in the obtained @xmath3 is the ambiguity of the s - wave @xmath7-@xmath0be interaction potentials for the channel spin @xmath326 and @xmath327 states .",

    "the error of each result is obtained by adding the theoretical and experimental errors in quadrature .",
    "the results are compared with @xmath3 extracted from the precise measurement of direct capture @xmath328 cross section  @xcite ( closed triangle ) and those obtained from @xmath2b dissociation with first - order perturbation theory ( closed circles ) .",

    "the results of first - order iterative solutions of cdcc , designated as one - step cdcc , correspond to and agree with those of first - order perturbation theory in the previous work  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the coulomb quadrupole ( e2 ) transitions , scaled by 0.7 , in the one - step calculation decreases @xmath3 by about 6% , and multistep processes increase it by about 20% .",
    "this shows the crucial importance of accurate description of the @xmath2b breakup process by cdcc including nuclear and coulomb e1 and e2 transitions and all higher - order processes",
    ". it will be interesting to apply the method of the present paper to analyses of wider range of experiments such as those in refs .",
