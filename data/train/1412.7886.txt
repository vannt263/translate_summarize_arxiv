    "systems with long range interactions may present unusual properties such as as non - ergodicity , anomalous diffusion , aging , non - gaussian quasi - stationary states ( qss ) , negative microcanonical heat capacity , ensemble inequivalence , and more importantly for the present work very long relaxation time to thermodynamic equilibrium of a qss , diverging with the number of particles @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a pair interaction potential is long - ranged in @xmath8 spatial dimensions if it decays at long distances as @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamics of such systems can be decomposed in three stages : a violent relaxation into a qss in a short time , a slow relaxation of the qss and the final thermodynamic equilibrium . in some cases after the violent relaxation the system may also oscillate for a very long or even infinite time around a qss  @xcite . by introducing a kac factor proportional to @xmath11 in the pair - interaction potential the fluid ( vlasov ) limit is well defined and given by @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is exactly described by the vlasov equation for the one particle distribution function , while for finite @xmath0 it is valid only for short times .",
    "collisional terms must be considered for a more accurate description of the dynamics for finite @xmath0 , leading to kinetic equations such as the landau or balescu - lenard equations  @xcite .",
    "as already noted , the dynamics of relaxation to equilibrium depends on the number of particles in the system and has been extensively studied in the recent literature  @xcite .",
    "its dependence on @xmath0 can be obtained from collisional corrections to the vlasov equation , i.  e.  by determining the relevant kinetic equation .",
    "two - body collisions lead to a collisional integral in the kinetic equations of order @xmath11 , and thus relaxation occurs in a time scale proportional to @xmath0 , an exception being three - dimensional gravity with a relaxation time of order @xmath13  @xcite",
    ". for one - dimensional homogeneous systems two - body terms in the kinetic equation vanish identically as collisions between two particles results only in momentum exchange  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the balescu - lenard and boltzmann equations for a homogeneous one - dimensional system with a pair interaction potential are respectively written as  @xcite : @xmath14 and @xmath15 , \\label{boltzeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the one - dimensional momentum variable , @xmath17 the particle density , @xmath18 the dielectric function and @xmath19 and @xmath20 the post - collisional momenta for incoming particles with momenta @xmath21 and @xmath22 . setting @xmath23 is equivalent to neglect collective effects and yields the landau equation . in both cases",
    "the right hand is identically zero due to the dirac delta function in the collisional integral in eq .",
    "( [ ballen ] ) , while for the boltzmann equation in eq .",
    "( [ boltzeq ] ) we have @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in both cases we obtain @xmath26 if only two - body collisions are considered , and the dominant term comes then from three - body or higher order terms .",
    "this has been considered recently for the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model , resulting in a dynamics of the homogeneous states scaling with @xmath7  @xcite , at variance with previous results with scalings proportional to @xmath6 and @xmath27 which are due to small @xmath0 effects  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 was also reported for a classical anisotropic heisenberg model by gupta and mukamel in ref .",
    "@xcite and the question remains if it is due also to small @xmath0 effects . in this paper",
    "we investigate this issue for small and large @xmath0 .",
    "we re - obtain a @xmath7 scaling for large @xmath0 as predicted from kinetic theory , while non - integer exponents in the scaling are due to finite @xmath0 effects , as a result of the failure of basic approximations usually considered for the determination of kinetic equation in closed form , as shown below .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we present the model and discuss some of its properties .",
    "the scaling of the dynamics of a qss is determine numerically in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "we address the limits of applicability of kinetic theory in section  [ sec3 ] and close the paper with some concluding remarks in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "the mean - field classical anisotropic heisenberg model consists of @xmath0 classical spins @xmath28 , @xmath29 , of unit length globally coupled , with hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath30 the first term in the right - hand side with @xmath31 describes a ferromagnetic mean - field coupling and the second term , a local anisotropy . following gupta and mukamel we take @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "note that the coefficient @xmath11 in the coupling term in hamiltonian is a kac factor that makes the energy extensive .",
    "the magnetization of the system is defined by : @xmath34 using spherical coordinates the spin components are written as @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and the equations of motion are given by : @xmath38 with @xmath39 and the poisson bracket : @xmath40 thus @xmath41 these equations of motion admit as first integrals the @xmath42-component @xmath43 of @xmath44 , the total energy and the the length of each spin .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the equations of motion as @xmath45 as a first result we observe that these equations are canonical and derive from the hamiltonian : @xmath46 . \\label{hamiltoniana}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] were @xmath47 and @xmath48 are canonically conjugate and correspond to the momentum and position variables respectively . as a consequence",
    "the model is effectively one - dimensional and thus explains why a scaling proportional to @xmath1 with @xmath49 is observed . as the model is effectively one - dimensional and hamiltonian",
    "the tools of kinetic theory can be used to derive a kinetic equation , as described for instance in ref .",
    "the first consequence of this fact is that for a homogeneous state in @xmath50 , the collisional integral proportion to @xmath11 of the balescu - lenard equation vanishes , and one must go to the next order in an expansion in powers of @xmath11 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in order to study the dynamics of a homogeneous state , and for comparison purposes , we use here the same initial condition as in ref .",

    "the state is spatially homogeneous and stable for this energy . from ref .",
    "@xcite the expected scaling of the dynamics of this qss is @xmath7 . on the other hand gupta and mukamel obtained from numerical simulations a different scaling in @xmath6 .",
    "we argue that , similar to what occurs in the hmf model , the @xmath6 scaling only occurs for sufficiently small number of particles , while for larger @xmath0 the scaling becomes proportional to @xmath7 .    in a homogeneous stable state",
    "the spatial distribution for variable @xmath50 is always uniform up to small fluctuations , but the distribution for variable @xmath56 slowly varies with time towards thermodynamic equilibrium  @xcite . as a consequence , the dynamics can be probed by the statistical moments @xmath57 .",
    "odd moments of @xmath56 vanish for an even distribution in @xmath56 as is the case here .",
    "figure  [ fig0 ] shows the second moment @xmath58 as a function of time .",
    "it varies very slowly for the states considered here ( it is almost a constant of motion ) so we consider the time evolution of the fourth moment @xmath59 which is more responsive to small changes in the statistical state of the system . in ref .",
    "@xcite gupta and mukamel considered the average @xmath60 which is more difficult to characterize the small variations in the distribution function of @xmath56 ( compare for instance fig .  3 of their paper to our figures  [ fig0 ] and  [ fig1 ] below ) .",
    "the equations of motion in eq .",
    "( [ eqmotion ] ) are solved using a parallel implementation of a fourth order runge - kutta algorithm in a graphics processing unit using the cuda extension to the c language  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to perform simulations with a much greater number of particles than considered in ref .",
    "the time - step used is @xmath61 and ensures a maximum relative error in the energy or order @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the time evolution of @xmath59 for different number of particles up to @xmath63 .",
    "figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] show the same results but with @xmath64 and @xmath65 time rescalings , respectively . a better data collapse is obtained for the @xmath7 scaling .    in order to compare quantitatively ours with previous results",
    ", we performed a series of simulations with the same number of particles as in ref .",
    "@xcite but also considering values of @xmath0 up to @xmath66 . by averaging over many realizations",
    "we compare the time evolution of @xmath59 for a given value of @xmath0 with the previous smaller number of @xmath0 in the simulations , and perform a least squares fit for the difference between both time series rescaled by @xmath67 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tabela ] and corroborate , up to some small deviations , a scaling in @xmath7 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the statistical moment @xmath59 for the same number of particles as in table  [ tabela ] with time scaled as @xmath65 with a very good data collapse for @xmath68 .",
    "we note that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , gupta and mukamel determined the scaling behavior considering the values @xmath69 .",
    "the difference of theirs and our results for the case @xmath70 and @xmath71 comes from the fact that considering the magnetization as a relevant variable yields more imprecise results then when considering the statistical moments of the momenta variables ( see also the discussion of this in ref .",

    "two and three particle correlation functions contribute with terms proportional to @xmath11 and @xmath65 , respectively . as two - particle contributions to the kinetic equation vanishing in the present case",
    "one must retain the contributions from three - particle collisions which are proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "these considerations are based on the introduction of the kac factor in the hamiltonian and the scaling proportional to @xmath74 reported by gupta and mukamel is re - obtained here for smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "this unusual scaling stems on the failure for small @xmath0 of the markovianization hypothesis used in the determination of the balescu - lenard and landau equations , which requires that the force auto - correlation function ( for homogeneous systems ) differs significantly from zero only for very short times if compared to the dynamical time scale over which the one - particle distribution function varies significantly .",
    "let us show this explicitly for the simpler case of the landau equation , i.  e.  for weak coupling , as the same kind of approximations are used in the deduction of the balescu - lenard equation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a thorough discussion on these assumptions ) .",
    "the @xmath0-particle distribution function @xmath75 is the probability density in the @xmath0-particle phase space for a particle at time @xmath76 to have position @xmath77 and momentum @xmath78 . defining the @xmath79-particle distribution function by @xmath80 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the position and momentum vectors of particle @xmath81 in @xmath8 dimensions .",
    "liouville equation then implies that the reduced distribution functions satisfy the bbgky hierarchy  @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the gradient operator for the position of particle @xmath85 . in order to obtain a closed kinetic equation for the one - particle distribution function @xmath86 we have to determine the functional dependence of @xmath87 on @xmath86 ( bogolyubov hypothesis  @xcite )",
    "this can be accomplished in the present framework by writing the reduced distribution functions in the form of a cluster expansion , which for a homogeneous system is given by : @xmath88 and so on , where the time dependence is kept implicit , @xmath89 stands for permutations of particles @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the @xmath79-particle correlation function . let us consider a parameter @xmath94 characterizing the strength of the interaction , i.  e.  @xmath95 .",
    "a two - particle correlation requires the interaction of two particles to be created and therefore @xmath96 is of order @xmath97 .",
    "a three - particle correlation requires the interaction between two pairs of particles and thus @xmath98 is of order @xmath99 , and so on . by considering the case @xmath100 in eq .",

    "\\label{landau1}\\ ] ] the two - particle correlation function is the solution of the equation obtained by replacing eq .",
    "( [ cluster3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ bbgky2 ] ) for @xmath102 and discarding higher order terms containing three - particle correlations : @xmath103 its solution can be written as : @xmath104 the first term in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "( [ landau3 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ landau1 ] ) and noting that the mean - field force vanishes in a homogeneous state , we obtain ( using @xmath106 for large @xmath0 ) : @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the force auto - correlation of the @xmath110 at position @xmath111 is defined by @xmath112 thence we have : @xmath113 this is a master equation which is non - markovian as it depends on @xmath86 at previous times form @xmath114 to @xmath76 . to obtain a true ( markovian ) kinetic equation",
    "the usual procedure is to assume that the dynamic time scale @xmath115 over which the one - particle distribution function @xmath86 varies significantly is much greater than the time scale @xmath116 such that the force auto - correlation is sufficiently small . in this case",
    ", one can replace @xmath117 in the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ landau6 ] ) by @xmath118 , which corresponds to the ballistic approximation ( free motion for a homogeneous system ) , and extend the time integration to infinity .",
    "we then finally obtain the landau equation : @xmath119 this form will suffice for the present discussion .",
    "the same type of considerations are also necessary in the determination of the balescu - lenard equation  @xcite . as discussed above , for a one - dimensional homogeneous system these corrections vanish and one must go one order further in the @xmath11 expansion .",
    "usually one always considers a markovianization procedure taking into account the time scales such that @xmath120 .",
    "a failure of this condition implies , among other things , that the collisional integral does not vanish exactly for a one - dimensional homogeneous system , and one should expect that the scaling of the dynamics is therefore affected .    in order",
    "do address this point , we compute the force auto - correlation function from numeric simulations by : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the force on particle @xmath81 at time @xmath76 due to all other particles .",
    "figure  [ fig5]a shows @xmath123 for different number of particles for the present model and the time evolution of @xmath124 for variable @xmath56 .",
    "we observe that the time required for a significant decrease of @xmath123 , i.  e.  the correlation time @xmath116 , is roughly the same for all values of @xmath0 , while the dynamical time @xmath115 is smaller for smaller @xmath0 as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in this way",
    ", the correlation time can become of the same order of magnitude as the dynamical time , breaking down the markovian condition , and therefore the usual derivation of kinetic equations from the bbgky hierarchy is no longer valid .",
    "figure  [ fig5]b show the fourth moment @xmath59 of variable @xmath56 and it becomes evident that markovianity is not valid for @xmath125 and @xmath70 , while it is approximately valid for @xmath126 . for @xmath127 the system is clearly markovian , in agreement with the results in table  [ tabela ] .",
    "this explains why a different scaling in @xmath1 of the dynamics with @xmath128 is observed for homogeneous one - dimensional systems for small @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we shown in this paper that the mean - field anisotropic heisenberg model introduced by gupta and mukamel in ref .",
    "@xcite is effectively a one - dimensional classical hamiltonian system , and the dynamics of a qss scales as @xmath7 for large @xmath0 while the scaling in @xmath6 previously reported is due to small @xmath0 non - markovian effects in the dynamics . for large @xmath0 a kinetic equation for a homogeneous one - dimensional long - range interacting system must consider three - body collisions , which are of order @xmath65 .",
    "this approach is only valid if @xmath0 is sufficiently large such that the contribution of strictly two - body collisions does vanish , while for small @xmath0 the arguments leading to the @xmath7 scaling fail .",
    "the small @xmath0 case can be tackled using an approach developed by ettoumi and firpo by determining the diffusion coefficient in terms of action variables who used a mean passage time approach  @xcite and obtained a @xmath6 scaling for the hamiltonian mean field model  @xcite .",
    "based on time evolution of the auto - correlation of the force for the homogeneous case , one can consider if a similar behavior occurs for non - homogeneous one - dimensional and for higher dimensional systems , and whether and how it influences the scaling for small @xmath0 .",
    "this will be the subject of a separate publication .",
    "this also raises the question whether similar effects might have a role in astrophysics .",
    "indeed smaller globular clusters can have a number of stars of the order of just a few thousand , as opposed to @xmath129 stars in a typical galaxy .",
    "other long - range interacting systems may also have a similar behavior .",
    "more recently , gupta and mukamel introduced a different model of classical spins in a sphere described bu a two - dimensional hamiltonian  @xcite and also displaying a scaling of the dynamics of a homogeneous qss in @xmath6 .",
