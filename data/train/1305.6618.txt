    ", we summarize results for the remaining 4 platonic - shells : dodecahedron - shell , cube - shell , octahedron - shell and the tetrahedron - shell .          the buckling behavior of the dodecahedron - shell ( also known as the @xmath46 icosadeltahedral shell ) is similar to that of the icosahedron - shell . in our case , we consider @xmath47 , which has 482 vertices , 1440 edges and 960 facets , with twelve 5-fold disclinations .",
    "the initial spherical shell quickly becomes faceted at the locations of the twelve symmetrically positioned five - fold coordinated points of the triangular mesh resulting in a structure that resembles a dodecahedron .",
    "as we increase the pressure , the facets of the shell become concave inward , and we see the emergence of twelve inward bulges as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dodec_lu ] .",
    "these dimples become more pronounced as we increase the pressure until at a critical buckling pressure @xmath48 , the shell loses stability and collapses , forming a structure that looks like a slightly squashed cube ( label ( 4 ) ) .",
    "thus , the number of inward bulges reduces from twelve to six and they become deeper as the pressure is increased even further . as the pressure is decreased ,",
    "the bulges become shallower until eventually four of the bulges disappear and the shell forms a discocyte - like structure .",
    "it is axisymmetrical with two inward dimples at the north and south poles ( label ( 6 ) ) . as the pressure",
    "is decreased still further to the original pressure , the shell resumes its original form as shown as shown in label ( 7 ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : dodec_lu ] .",
    "consistent with the higher buckling pressure @xmath49 , the hysteresis is larger for the dodecahedral - shell compared to the icosahedral - shell .",
    "our shape analysis of the dodecahedron - shell under hydrostatic pressure reveals a similar picture as compared to the icosahedral - shell as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dodec_lu ] . during the buckling phase",
    ", there is a spontaneous breaking of the icosahedral symmetry and the emergence of additional @xmath28 modes . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : dodec_lu ] , the @xmath50 s for @xmath51 modes become comparable ( @xmath5230% ) to @xmath53 mode .",
    "the slight asymmetry of the curves about shape ( 4 ) reflects the hysteretic behavior of the system . for the shape indicated by the label ( 6 )",
    ", we see that there is a spike in @xmath54 mode . initially , the nonvanishing @xmath55 s are @xmath56 . as",
    "the shell buckles , @xmath57 increases from 0 to @xmath58 , suggesting the emergence of octahedral / tetrahedral - symmetry .",
    "the value of @xmath57 stays pretty constant at 0.13 along the hysteresis loop except at the start and end points where it almost vanishes .",
    "also , we see that during the buckling transition , @xmath59 decreases from @xmath60 to @xmath61 indicating a suppression of icosahedral - symmetry ( @xmath62 ) and the emergence of the octahedral - symmetry ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "@xmath64 stays around 0.05 during buckling , which is fairly close to that of the octahedral / tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "additionally , @xmath65 after buckling , indicating the presence of @xmath66-wave excitations .",
    "unlike the icosahedron - shell , in this case , the positive value of @xmath67 indicates a reduced symmetry which is prolate in nature .",
    "overall , we find that the dodecahedron - shell displays similar hysteretic behavior to the icosahedral - shell",
    ".      for the cube - shell , denoted @xmath68 in the caspar - klug notation , we have 770 vertices , 2304 edges and 1536 facets , with six 4-fold disclinations .",
    "our simulations show that the initial spherical surface quickly becomes cubical .",
    "as we increase the pressure , the shell becomes more and more faceted , with well - defined ridges , and the buckled shape becomes more and more cubical .",
    "the six evenly distributed inward bulges become deeper as we increase the pressure resulting in a more shriveled structure .",
    "as we decrease the pressure , the shell starts to swell up again , along a different pathway . at a certain pressure , @xmath69 ,",
    "the bulges disappear and the shell becomes globally convex and there is a noticeably jump in the volume . we find that @xmath70 throughout the lu cycle .",
    "this process is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : cube_lu ] . the hysteresis of the cycle , defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum pressures that define the loop , is larger than that for the icosahedral and dodecahedral shells .",
    "there are three distinctive parts to the hysteresis loop : 1 ) the buckling phase from label ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) ; 2 ) the relaxation phase from shape ( 3 ) to ( 5 ) and the restoration ( or pop - out ) phase from label ( 5 ) to ( 6 ) .",
    "there is no noticeable  snap - through \" phase as structurally , the shell appears to retain cubical symmetry throughout the cycle .",
    "the plots of @xmath33 and @xmath71 reveal a similar picture as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cube_lu]a and b. during the buckling phase , the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 all become more prominent , while modes with other @xmath28 s are suppressed .",
    "the most important mode corresponds to @xmath75 , with an amplitude that is almost twice as large as the second highest mode @xmath76 .",
    "however , as we decrease the pressure , all the excited modes amplitudes decrease in magnitude , as the shell resumes a more spherical shape .",
    "throughout the hysteresis cycle @xmath71 for @xmath77 remains constant and only @xmath78 shows a slight departure from the initial value , while the other @xmath79 s are vanishingly small .",
    "thus , the shrinking shell retains its cubic symmetry to a high extent through the buckling process .",
    "hence , there is no symmetry group breaking wherein the @xmath54 terms appearing during the lu cycle , e.g. @xmath80 .",
    "the case for the octahedron - shell is very similar to the cube - shell , which is unsurprising since they are dual to one another .",
    "we study a @xmath81 in the caspar - klug notation , a triangulation that has 1026 vertices , 3072 edges and 2048 facets , with six 4-fold disclinations .",
    "the spherical shell quickly becomes octahedral - like in shape at the start of the simulation , consistent with what we observed in the previous section .",
    "as we increase the pressure , the shell retains the octahedral symmetry , and we see eight inward triangular bulges appear symmetrically on the surface . as the pressure is further increased , the bulges become deeper , facilitating a smaller volume .",
    "there is no noticeable buckling behavior as the shell remains octahedral - like throughout .",
    "as we decrease pressure to go the opposite sense in the hysteresis loop , the shell starts to swell up and the depressions become shallower and at @xmath82 , the depressions disappear as the volume jump significantly and all the concave regions disappear from the shell .",
    "the whole hysteresis loop is summarized in fig .",

    ", we find that the most important modes are @xmath83 and @xmath84 followed by @xmath75 and @xmath85 .",

    "[ fig : octa_lu]b . for the case of @xmath71",
    ", we find that @xmath57 , @xmath59 and @xmath64 remain fairly constant during the whole hysteresis cycle . as the shell becomes buckled , we see the simultaneous emergence of @xmath86 , signaling a reduced symmetry which is prolate in nature and the reduction in @xmath87 and @xmath78 .",
    "overall , we see small deviation from octahedral - symmetry and the emergence of @xmath66-wave modes ( @xmath28 = 2 ) .    upon comparing the mechanical response of the octahedron - shell and cube - shell , we see that qualitatively they are very similar as both types of shells maintain high degree of octahedral - symmetry throughout the hysteresis cycle as seen from the constant values in @xmath71 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cube_lu ] and [ fig : octa_lu ] ) .",
    "the only significant deviation is that for the octahedron - shell , we see the emergence of @xmath54 mode , which is absent in the cube - shell .",
    "the hysteresis effect in both octahedron - shell and cube - shell is more pronounced as compared to the icosahedron - shell and dodecahedron - shell .",
    "finally , we consider the @xmath88 tetrahedron - shell .",
    "our triangulation has 514 vertices , 1536 edges and 1024 facets , with four 3-fold disclinations .",
    "on increasing the ambient pressure , the spherical shell quickly becomes tetrahedral - like in shape at the start of the simulation due to the presence of the disclinations .",
    "as we increase the pressure , the shell retains the tetrahedral symmetry , and we see four inward triangular bulges appear symmetrically on the surface . as the pressure is further increased , the bulges become deeper , facilitating a smaller volume .",
    "there is no noticeable buckling behavior as the shell remains tetrahedral - like throughout .",
    "as the pressure is decreased , the shell starts to reswell and the dimples become shallower ; eventually for @xmath89 , they disappear .",
    "the whole hysteresis loop is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetra_lu ] . in terms of the @xmath33",
    ", we find that the most important modes correspond to @xmath90 followed by @xmath75 and @xmath91 .",
    "the other non - zero modes correspond to @xmath92 which are all very small in magnitude . during the loading and unloading cycle ,",
    "we find that the magnitude of @xmath93 fluctuates while the rest of the @xmath94 s remain fairly constant in magnitude . in terms of the @xmath95",
    ", we find that the non - zero modes are @xmath96 with @xmath75 being the most dominant .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath97 throughout , even though @xmath98 . presumably , this is due to the fact that the tetrahedron is self - dual .",
    "all the @xmath71 except for @xmath78 remain constant during the whole loading - unloading cycle implying that the symmetry is conserved during the whole loading - unloading cycle . in this case",
    "we do not find symmetry breaking although we still see the presence of hysteresis .",
    "note from table i that the sign of @xmath55 for the smallest @xmath28 for which @xmath55 is nonzero distinguishes the icosahedron from its dual , the dodecahedron and the octohedron from its dual the cube .",
    "@xmath97 , presumably because this object is self - dual .",
    "note that any discrete triangulation punctuated by a regular array of defects will inevitably lead to small nonzero values of @xmath99 with the appropriate symmetry , even though the overall shape is nearly spherical .",
    "however , the effect of these small background ordering fields is negligible , in light of the large first - order - like transition displayed in fig .  3 ."
