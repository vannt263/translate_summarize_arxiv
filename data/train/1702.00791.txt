    "the details of our new results will be published elsewhere @xcite .",

    "+ in @xcite we were interested in noncommutative resolutions ( = ncrs ) of certain non - normal hypersurfaces , so - called free divisors , and explicitly constructed a ncr of a normal crossings divisor . after some extensive calculations we realized that there was a more conceptual way to understand this particular ncr as a quotient of the skew group ring of the polynomial ring in @xmath6 variables and the reflection group @xmath7 by a two - sided ideal generated by an idempotent of the skew group ring . and since the normal crossings divisor is the discriminant of a real reflection group , we had the idea to carry out the same quotient procedure for other discriminants of reflection groups .",
    "it was readily verified that indeed this construction works for any discriminant of a finite reflection group . + after some more painful calculations and serious doubts , that these quotients are endomorphism rings in general , we were finally able to also prove this for reflection groups generated by reflections of order @xmath8 , and discovered the surprising fact that the corresponding reflection arrangement is in some sense the noncommutative resolution of the discriminant of a reflection group . moreover , our work generalizes auslander s theorem about skew group rings of small subgroups @xmath9 and thus our ncrs give rise to a mckay correspondence for reflection groups . for reflection groups",

    "the following result is the key theorem in proving the correspondence between indecomposable cm - modules and irreducible representations .",
    "however note that the assumptions on @xmath16 are more general than before : we may take any @xmath16 which does not contain any pseudo - reflections and the dimension of @xmath17 may be greater than @xmath8 :    let @xmath19 be as above and assume that @xmath12 , @xmath129 , is small and set @xmath130 .",
    "then we have an isomorphism of algebras : @xmath131 moreover , @xmath132 is a cm - module over @xmath1 and @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .    this result can be phrased in terms of nccrs :    if @xmath135 , that is , @xmath1 is a gorenstein singularity , then @xmath124 is an nccr of @xmath1 .",

    "in particular , is there also a noncommutative resolution hidden somewhere ?",
    "the first problem in generalizing auslander s theorem is that if @xmath16 is a pseudo - reflection group , then the map @xmath147 is no longer surjective .",
    "one can see this for example for @xmath148 .",
    "then @xmath143 contains the so - called demazure operators , see e.g. @xcite , which are not contained in the skew group ring .",
    "however , one can show in this case that @xmath124 is the intersection of @xmath149 in @xmath150 , the quotient ring of @xmath124 , where @xmath151 is a particular anti - involution on @xmath143 , for details see @xcite .",
    "+ another `` problem '' is that @xmath130 is no longer singular if @xmath16 is generated by pseudo - reflections , by thm .",
    "[ thm : cst ] .",
    "this , however , can be remedied by looking at the discriminant @xmath152 : the discriminant defines a singular hypersurface , whose singularities occur in codimension @xmath95 . more precisely : it was shown by saito and terao that the discriminant of a reflection arrangement @xmath43 is a so - called _ free divisor _ in @xmath1 , that is , the jacobian ideal of @xmath51 is a cm - module over @xmath153 .",
    "one can also show that the reflection arrangement itself defines a free divisor in @xmath19 . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "+ the above facts already suggest our strategy to attack the problem of finding an analogue of auslander s theorem and a noncommutative resolution for the discriminant : we will start with the twisted group ring @xmath141 and using the small group @xmath154 we will cook up a ncr of @xmath51 , which will also yield a @xmath155-correspondence to irreducible representations of @xmath16 .",
    "for this section let us change the notation slightly : first , we will assume that @xmath16 is a true reflection group , i.e. , @xmath156 , @xmath129 , is generated by reflections of order @xmath8 ( some of our results also hold for pseudo - reflection groups but the main correspondence only works in this case so far )",
    ". we will denote the invariant ring @xmath59 by @xmath157 . by theorem [ thm : cst ]",
    "@xmath158 $ ] for the basic invariants @xmath159 .",
    "since @xmath16 is a true reflection group @xmath160 and the hyperplane arrangement @xmath43 is defined by the polynomial @xmath161 .",
    "the discriminant @xmath51 is then defined by the equation @xmath162 , where @xmath51 is in @xmath157 .",
    "its coordinate ring will be denoted by @xmath163 . for our construction of the ncr of @xmath51",
    ", we consider the small group @xmath164 , with invariant ring @xmath110 .",
    "we have an exact sequence of groups @xmath165 , where the quotient is @xmath166 .",
    "moreover , as above , we denote by @xmath123 the twisted group ring of @xmath16 .",
    "+ the first result deals with the problem that @xmath124 is not isomorphic to @xmath167 . we can show that @xmath124 is still isomorphic to an endomorphism ring - yet over another twisted group ring :    [ thm : bilodeau ] with notation introduced in the paragraph above , there is an isomorphism of rings @xmath168    this result follows from generalizing the approach of h.  knrrer for curves @xcite ( also using ideas from j.  bilodeau @xcite ) . + for simplifying notation set @xmath169 .",
    "now one can interpret @xmath170 as the path algebra over @xmath157 of a quiver @xmath171 modulo some relations .",

    "one crucial observation here is that @xmath174 is isomorphic to @xmath163 as rings .",
    "thus , using the functor @xmath175 from the standard recollement we obtain the following result :    [ thm : knoerrer ] the functor @xmath176 induces an equivalence of categories @xmath177 where @xmath178 denotes the ideal generated by the object @xmath179 in the category @xmath180 .    theorem",
