    "numerical studies of interacting galaxies have come far since the first efforts , but every study to date has grappled with the huge variety of encounters which are possible . in a fundamental paper , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tt ) introduced a key set of parameters and illustrated how these parameters influence the outcome of a tidal encounter .",
    "many subsequent studies have adopted similar parameterizations and explored some subset of galactic encounters .",
    "for example , a number of authors have focused on equal - mass encounters , in which both galaxies have the same initial structure , and systematically examined the tidal response as a function of encounter parameters such as initial disc orientation .",
    "somewhat less attention has been given to the ways in which tidal interactions depend on the _ internal _ structures of the galaxies involved .",
    "for tt , this issue was almost moot  with all the gravitating mass concentrated in a central point , all they needed to do was to vary the outer radii of their test - particle discs .",
    "once self - consistent simulations became possible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the question of internal structure , and in particular the amount of dark matter , became more interesting .",
    "@xcite simulated encounters between galaxies with various disc / halo mass ratios , and reported that only relatively low - mass haloes permitted the formation of long tidal tails .",
    "later studies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sw ) examined this claim in detail , and converged on a more precise conclusion : tail length constrains potential - well _ shape _ , not disc / halo fraction ( see   [ sec : tailform ] ) .",
    "but these studies largely focused on the specific question of tail formation , and paid less attention to the broader relationship between internal structure and tidal interactions .",
    "hierarchical galaxy formation includes stochastic elements which inevitably produce variations in galactic properties and structure .",
    "disc galaxies display a range of rotation curves ; some have gently rising profiles , while others reach a maximum at a few disc scale lengths and remain flat or gradually decline at larger radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even within the constraints implied by the baryonic tully - fischer relationship ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) there seems to be room for interesting variety , with the luminous mass fraction ( including both stars and gas ) varying by a factor of a few from galaxy to galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus in modeling tidal encounters of disc galaxies , there are good reasons to experiment with different halo structures .",
    "ultimately , detailed modeling of interacting galaxies may provide a way to study the initial structure of their progenitors .",
    "this could offer a unique window on halo properties , involving the dark matter as a fully dynamical participant and probing its distribution out to relatively large radii . at present",
    ", however , it s not clear how much information can be extracted from modeling ; for example , can dynamical modeling correctly diagnose halo structure , or do the plethora of parameters available insure that the observations can be matched tolerably well even with the wrong choice of halo model",
    "? to frame this question more tightly , suppose we",
    "the orbital and viewing geometry of an interacting system  under this very idealized set of circumstances , detailed modeling yield a correct picture of halo structure ?",
    "distinctive tidal features form when galactic discs are subject to relatively brief but violent tides during close encounters ( tt ) . unlike the rather broad tidal bulges that the moon creates on earth , the tidal features extracted from spinning galactic discs are often quite narrow and extended . in a typical encounter ,",
    "each disc produces two such features : a _ bridge _ toward the galaxy s companion , and a _ tail _ stretching in the opposite direction .",
    "the most pronounced bridges and tails develop when a galaxy s spin angular momentum is parallel to the orbital angular momentum of a passing companion . in this case , the angular velocities of individual stars resonate with the angular velocity of the companion , creating a strong response ( tt ; @xcite ) .",
    "an extended tail can only form if the companion s mass is comparable to or exceeds the victim s ; otherwise , the result is a weaker ` counter - arm ' which soon falls back into the parent galaxy . in systems like ngc  4676 where _ both _ galaxies exhibit tails , this implies that the two galaxies have comparable masses .",
    "sw , , showed that even under otherwise favorable circumstances , if the quantity @xmath3 exceeds a certain value .",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 are the escape and circular velocity , respectively , .",
    "the situation for encounters with mass ratios @xmath6 has not yet been investigated .",
    "this criterion can be directly visualized on a plot of gravitational potential @xmath7 .",
    "[ fig : escplot ] illustrates the relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for a keplerian potential , @xmath10 everywhere , so @xmath11",
    "this implies that . for comparison , consider the @xcite model , which has a potential of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the scale radius .",
    "it s evident that @xmath14 everywhere , and @xmath15 , , in the @xmath16 limit .",
    "the condition @xmath17 is satisfied at radii @xmath18 .",
    "thus , to produce tails , a disc of test particles embedded in a @xcite potential with scale radius @xmath19 must have a median radius @xmath20 .",
    "similar considerations apply to other extended mass distributions , .",
    "this simple example suggests that modeling will indeed be able to provide some information on halo structure  the very existence of long tidal tails implies , at a minimum , that some galaxies have @xmath17 . but further work is needed to find out how much more we can learn .      to determine what detailed modeling of tidal encounters might teach us",
    ", it seems reasonable to investigate encounters between a variety of galaxy models .",
    "this is not an entirely new direction ; in particular , sw and @xcite provide significant precedents . the present study expands on their work , testing a wide range of galaxy models , classifying tidal responses , and systematically comparing tidal .",
    "like these studies , it shares one key limitation : the two galaxies in each encounter are ` twins ' , with the same mass _ and _ the same internal structure .",
    "however , a fairly wide range of internal structures are employed , producing a variety of interaction dynamics and tidal configurations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 first develops a set of galaxy models and identifies those which are stable and therefore suitable raw material for further investigations , and next describes the set of encounters simulated using these galaxies .",
    "section  3 presents simulation results , focusing on orbital evolution , while section  4 covers characterization of tidal features .",
    "section  5 takes up the hypothetical modeling problem just described , and asks how well tidal response can constrain halo structure .",
    "conclusions appear in section  6 .",
    "technical details are described in appendix  a , while tests of isolated galaxy models appear in appendix  b.",
    "each galaxy model contains three collisionless components , profiles ; in order of decreasing mass , halo , disc , and bulge .",
    "the halo is composed of dark matter , while the disc and bulge are composed of luminous material ( stars ) , but all are assumed to obey the same @xmath21-body equations of motion .",
    "the halo has a ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter nfw ) profile , parameterized by a total mass @xmath22 , a scale radius @xmath23 , and a taper radius @xmath24 . within @xmath25 ,",
    "the profile is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass within @xmath23 . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the density profile tapers off exponentially , using the functional form devised by sw .",
    "the taper radius @xmath24 is usually called the ` virial radius ' and identified with @xmath29 , the radius within which the average density of the halo is @xmath30 times the critical density of the universe ( nfw ) .",
    "this identity constrains the scaling of numerical models to physical units , but is nt directly relevant for the present calculations , which treat the tapered nfw profile as a convenient functional form .",
    "in addition , the nfw profile is used ` as is ' , without adiabatic compression ; this is further discussed in   [ sec : halo_compress ] .",
    "the disc has an exponential - isothermal profile , parameterized by mass @xmath31 , inverse scale length @xmath32 , and scale height @xmath33 : @xmath34 no outer limit is imposed on the disc profile . in the present experiments , discs account for @xmath35  percent of the luminous material .",
    "the scale height is independent of @xmath36 and is fixed at @xmath37 for all models .",
    "the central bulge has a @xcite profile , parameterized by mass @xmath38 and scale radius @xmath39 : @xmath40 bulges account for the other @xmath41  percent by mass of the luminous material , so @xmath42 .",
    "the bulge scale radius is taken to be @xmath43 in all experiments .",
    "such a compact bulge has little direct effect on the dynamics of tidal interactions , but it helps to stabilize the disc against bar instabilities . in @xmath21-body simulations",
    "the @xmath44 tail of the bulge profile presents some difficulties , since the outermost body has radius @xmath45 ; as described in @xcite , it s convenient to smoothly taper ( [ eq : bulge - profile ] ) at large @xmath36 .",
    "the first and most fundamental parameter is the luminous mass fraction , @xmath46 . in @xmath0cdm models",
    "_ wmap _ and _ planck _ , baryons comprise @xmath47  percent of the matter @xcite .",
    "if all baryons were incorporated into galactic disc and bulge then it would be appropriate to set @xmath48 .",
    "this value is almost certainly too high in view of the evident inefficiency of galaxy formation , as illustrated by observations of massive outflows from star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", experiments are run with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the second parameter is the halo concentration , @xmath52 . in @xmath0cdm simulations ,",
    "the concentration of a halo depends on its formation history ; haloes which have recently been restructured by major mergers typically have low concentrations , while those which have been quietly accreting for a long time have higher concentrations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "as noted above , ( [ eq : halo - profile ] ) is used here as a convenient function , and the value of @xmath24 is not tied directly to the cosmology . to sample a range of both realistic and counterfactual possibilities , values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55",
    "are adopted ; the first of these makes contact with earlier experiments which typically used rather small haloes .",
    "the third parameter is the disc ` compactness ' , @xmath56 ( the slightly nonstandard terminology is a reminder that larger values of @xmath56 imply _ smaller _ discs , and vice versa ) . values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are used here .",
    "note that these values are almost equally spaced logarithmically by factors very close to @xmath62{2}$ ] .",
    "the range of @xmath56 values is dictated by two considerations .",

    "quantified by the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath63 here @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are the proto - galaxy s mass , angular momentum , and binding energy , respectively . in a simple picture where discs form via gradual gas cooling within initially well - mixed and undifferentiated haloes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these parameters may be estimated as follows .",
    "neglect of accretion or outflows implies @xmath67 .",
    "gas and dark matter are both subject to the same tidal torques @xcite , and therefore should have the same specific angular momenta ; assuming that the gas conserves angular momentum as it cools , @xmath68 , where the right - hand side refers to the _ present _ disc .",
    "finally , @xmath66 may be by assuming that the virialized proto - galaxy had the same radial distribution as the present halo .    fig .",
    "[ fig : vrot ] shows @xmath69 values for each model , simulations of formation in @xmath0cdm indicate that the spin parameter has a median value @xmath70 , with some dependence on the algorithm used to define bound haloes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the distribution of @xmath69 is , with 10th and 90th percentiles differing by a factor of @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "most of the stable galaxy models in fig .",
    "[ fig : vrot ] have estimated @xmath69 values exceeding @xmath72 .",
    ", given the width of the @xmath69 distribution , it seems reasonable to view models with @xmath73 as generally consistent with galaxy formation in a @xmath0cdm universe .      unlike earlier studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; sw )",
    ", the nfw halo profiles in the present models were not modified to account for adiabatic compression by the gravitational field of the disc and bulge .",
    "this is partly a matter of convenience ; the process of model construction and any auxiliary calculations are more straightforward if the nfw profile is used without modification . however , there are two additional considerations .",
    "* 1 . * the standard halo compression algorithm , due to @xcite , is based on the assumption that the halo responds as if its constituent particles are on circular orbits . in practice",
    ", this may not be a good assumption ; haloes formed by gravitational collapse are likely to have _ radially _ biased velocity distributions . a number of studies @xcite have found that the @xcite algorithm significantly _ overestimates _ the response of initially isotropic or radially - biased haloes",
    ". @xcite describe an algorithm , based on @xcite s treatment of adiabatic compression in spherical systems , which describes the compression of such haloes more accurately .",
    "observational evidence suggests that the effect of galaxy formation on halo structure is considerably more complex than models of adiabatic compression imply .",
    "dwarf disc galaxies , in particular , appear to have haloes with constant - density cores or cusps shallower than the @xmath74 nfw profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one possible explanation invokes what might be called _ non - adiabatic decompression _ of dark haloes in response to explosive ejection of baryonic material ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . while compressed nfw haloes fit the rotation curves of massive galaxies fairly well ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , direct evidence for massive outflows ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) shows that baryons do nt always accumulate in a gradual and monotonic fashion .    in sum ,",
    "the standard recipe for halo compression should probably be replaced by a more accurate treatment including both adiabatic and non - adiabatic processes .",
    "however , it s not yet clear what effects must be included .",
    "the exploratory calculations presented here are relatively insensitive to the details of the inner halo profile ; halo compression alter the main results of this study .",
    "the bulge , disc , and halo components of each model are initialized in approximate dynamical equilibrium with their combined gravitational field . for the halo and bulge , a smoothing formalism @xcite",
    "is used to compute their contributions to the gravitational field , while the disc s contribution is approximated by an equivalent spherical mass distribution .",
    "isotropic distribution functions for the bulge and halo are computed using eddington s formula , and ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the disc is initialized using jeans equations to constrain moments of the velocity distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while this procedure is somewhat ad hoc , it s very fast ; this is when many simulations are planned .",
    "the large number of experiments dictates relatively modest particle numbers : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 to  @xmath78 .",
    "however , to study tidal responses .",
    "further details of the simulations are given in appendix  a.      all of the encounters described here have the same mass ratio , @xmath79 , initial orbital eccentricity , @xmath80 , and encounter geometry .",
    "disc lies exactly in the orbital plane and rotates in the same direction that the two galaxies pass each other ; this disc therefore has inclination @xmath81 .",
    "the other disc has an inclination of @xmath82 and a nominal pericentric argument , relative to the idealized keplerian orbit , of @xmath83 .",
    "thus , while both discs have prograde ( @xmath84 ) encounters , the second disc is tilted by a fairly large angle , generating rather different tidal features .",
    "the primary spans a grid of four parameters .",
    "three describe the galaxy model and .",
    "the remaining parameter specifies the pericentric separation of the initial orbit , @xmath85 .",
    "all four of these parameters are dimensionless quantities ; to summarize , the values used are @xmath86 since only @xmath87 of the @xmath88 galaxy models are stable , the primary sample contains a total of @xmath89 different encounters .",
    "in addition to the primary sample , @xmath90 encounters with pericentric separations interpolating between the values in ( [ eq : primary - encounter - grid ] ) were run .",
    "this secondary sample contains six galaxy models ; three with luminous fraction @xmath91 , disc compactness @xmath92 , and halo concentration @xmath93 , and three with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath93 .",
    "pericentric separations of @xmath96 when combined with the primary grid , provide finer coverage in @xmath85 .",
    "this secondary sample is useful in exploring trends with pericentric separation for the six models it includes .",
    "an encounter s pericentric separation @xmath97 is related to the angular momentum @xmath98 of its initial parabolic orbit : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the mass of a single galaxy .",
    "this angular momentum is presumably generated by tidal torques acting on the two galactic haloes as they collapse out of the hubble flow , reach their maximum separation , and fall back towards each other ; the amount of momentum torques generate implies an upper limit to @xmath97 . to estimate this limit ,",
    "assume that haloes merge without significant ejection of mass , angular momentum , or binding energy ; the remnant will then have spin parameter @xmath101 where @xmath102 is binding energy of the initial configuration . since initially the orbit is parabolic and",
    "the galaxies are well - separated , @xmath102 is just twice the binding energy of a single galaxy , @xmath103 , where the form factor @xmath104 has a weak dependence on @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath56 . evaluating this factor",
    "numerically yields @xmath107 where the given uncertainty encompasses the full range of values possible for all @xmath87 stable galaxy models .",
    "the upshot is that encounters with @xmath108 to  @xmath109 have orbital angular momenta within the range which can be produced by the tidal torque mechanism .",
    "wider encounters are probably rare , requiring special circumstances to so much angular momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "closer encounters can occur and are certainly worth investigating .",
    "a tidal encounter between two extended , self - gravitating objects transfers energy and momentum from relative motion to internal degrees of freedom . as a result ,",
    "the orbits of interacting galaxies evolve and eventually decay , merger .      while keplerian trajectories neatly parameterize the ingoing orbits of a pair of initially well - separated galaxies , they do nt describe the circumstances of deeply interpenetrating encounters very well .",
    "in such encounters , galaxies begin diverging from their initial orbits even before their first passage .",
    "such divergence is to be expected : once they are close enough to interpenetrate , the mutual gravitational acceleration of two spatially extended structures is less than that of two equivalent point masses . with less acceleration to bend their trajectories ,",
    "the galaxies undergo a first passage both wider and slower than their initial keplerian orbit would imply .",
    "accurate orbital trajectories are needed to examine this effect . at every time - step , the central position @xmath110 and",
    "velocity @xmath111 of galaxy @xmath112 were computed by averaging over a fixed set @xmath113 of tightly - bound bodies .",
    "these sets were constructed by initially sorting the bulge bodies of galaxy @xmath112 by binding energy , and using the @xmath41 percent most tightly bound as @xmath113 . while some diffusion in binding energy occurs due to @xmath21-body scattering and dynamical evolution , the most tightly - bound quartile of the bulge is stable and provides a robust determination of galaxy position , capable of tracking the motion of the dynamical centre through at least the first three pericentric passages .",
    "( galaxy velocities are determined a bit less accurately since the bodies in @xmath113 have a larger spread in velocity than in position , but in practice the inner quartile of each bulge averages over enough bodies to provide good results . ) as these trajectories are computed , it s straightforward to identify the instant @xmath114 of closest approach ; a snapshot of the system at this time is saved for subsequent analysis .",
    "let latexmath:[$r_{\\mathrm{p1 } } =    latexmath:[$v_{\\mathrm{p1 } } =    separation and relative velocity at time @xmath114 ; these may be compared to the corresponding keplerian values , @xmath97 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "the ratio @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the galactic half - mass radius , quantifies the degree of interpenetration which _ would _ occur if the galaxies on their initial trajectories . despite its somewhat hypothetical formulation ,",
    "this ratio is a good predictor of orbital behavior ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , it predicts the actual pericentric separation @xmath119 ; as fig .",
    "[ fig : interpen ] shows , all @xmath120 simulations presented here follow a fairly tight power - law of the form @xmath121 .",
    "similar relationships are obtained using @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the radii enclosing one quarter and three quarters of the mass , respectively , although the former correlation shows more scatter . in the limit of very wide , non - interpenetrating passages ,",
    "@xmath124 presumably approaches @xmath125 from above , so these empirical power - laws ca nt be universal . however , fig .",
    "[ fig : interpen ] nicely illustrates how initial pericentric separation and halo concentration jointly influence first passage via the degree of interpenetration .",
    "deviations from keplerian trajectories are largest for close encounters ( red : @xmath126 ) between extended galaxies ( triangles : @xmath127 ) , and smallest for wide encounters ( blue : @xmath128 ) between compact galaxies ( stars : @xmath53 ) .",
    "[ fig : radvelperi ] displays measured pericentric separations @xmath119 and relative velocities @xmath129 , normalized by the corresponding values for the initial keplerian orbits . this plot reveals a simple pattern : across the entire set of @xmath120 self - consistent encounters , the specific angular momentum at pericentre @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the specific angular momentum of the initial orbit .",
    "this factor of @xmath132 appears because tidal interactions , operating even _ before _ first passage , have transferred about @xmath55  percent of the initial angular momentum from orbital motion to internal degrees of freedom within each galaxy .",
    "it seems remarkable , given the range of encounters studied here , that such a consistent fraction of orbital angular momentum is lost . for comparison , the three open symbols in this figure show experiments with very heavily softened point masses , which can be thought of as rigid mass profiles . because they can not deform ,",
    "their orbits do not decay , and their encounters conserve orbital momentum exactly .",
    "a final point concerns the argument of pericentre @xmath133 for the second ( @xmath82 ) discs .",

    "_ pericentre .",

    "as tt showed , tidal responses are typically strongest for @xmath137 and weakest for @xmath138 . in the present study , since @xmath139 , most of these discs should respond in a fairly uniform manner , with variations in @xmath140 playing only a minor role .",
    "all of these galaxy pairs become bound their first passage , and subsequently fall back together .",
    "the time between first and second , @xmath141 , is comparable to the orbital period at the galactic half - mass radius , @xmath142 , since @xmath142 is the time - scale for a galaxy to rearrange its mass distribution .",

    "disc compactness has almost no influence on these trajectories ; for the @xmath49 encounters , apocentric separation decreases slightly as @xmath56 is reduced , but no discernible effect is seen for smaller values of @xmath106 .",
    "this is not very surprising since the disc is a small fraction of the total mass .",
    "rather more surprising is the _ reversal _ of orbital angular momentum following close passages of extended , massive haloes .",
    "this can be seen , for example , in the large plot for ensemble @xmath149 , where the oval curves traced by the wider encounters give way to increasingly hairpin turns at apocentre as @xmath85 is reduced .",
    "for the two closest members of the ensemble ( green and red curves , for @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively ) , the hairpin becomes a self - crossing loop , and galaxy  @xmath109 falls back toward galaxy  @xmath125 on a slightly _ counter - clockwise _ path .",
