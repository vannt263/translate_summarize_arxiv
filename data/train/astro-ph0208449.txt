    "carbon stars are tracers of the intermediate age population in galaxies .",
    "either they are currently undergoing third dredge - up on the ( thermal - pulsing ) asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb )  the cool and luminous n - type carbon stars  , or have been enriched with carbon - rich material in a binary system when the present - day white dwarf was on the agb ( the carbon dwarfs and ch - stars .",
    "the r - stars may be the result of a coalescing binary [ mcclure 1997 ] ) .",
    "since their spectral signature is very different from oxygen - rich and s - type stars , it is relatively easy to identify carbon stars even at large distances . in sect .",
    "2 the main technique to identify carbon stars is briefly discussed , and in sect .",
    "3 the various surveys for carbon stars in external galaxies are summarised .",
    "that section is in fact , an update of a review i gave at iau symposium 191 ( groenewegen 1999 ; hereafter g99 ) , and here i will only refer to new results published since then , or older literature when i use it to obtain new results",
    ". please refer to g99 , and the similar review by azzopardi ( 1999 ) for the full story .",
    "the results and some recent theoretical predictions are discussed in sect .",
    "this has been discussed in some detail in g99 . briefly",
    ", the most effective method for large scale surveys of late - type m- and c - stars uses typically two broad - band filters from the set @xmath1 , and two narrow - band filters near 7800 and 8100  , which are centred on a cn - band in carbon stars , and a tio band in oxygen - rich stars , respectively . in an [ 78 - 81 ] versus @xmath2 $ ] ( or similar ) colour - colour plot , carbon stars and late - type oxygen - rich stars clearly separate redwards of @xmath3 1.6 . for an illustration of this ,",
    "see cook & aaronson ( 1989 ) , or kerschbaum et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "a caveat is that , unfortunately , not all groups adopt the same `` boxes '' in these diagrams to select m- and c - stars ( e.g. compare nowotny et al . 2001 and demers et al .",
    "furthermore , in many cases , only the photometry is published for the stars the respective authors consider to be the m- and c - stars , so its impossible to apply ones own selection criteria a posteriori .",
    "furthermore , one usually applies the same lower - limit on the broad band colour ( @xmath4 , or @xmath5 ) to select m - stars ( usually chosen to correspond to m0 and later ) to c - stars , while it is known ( e.g. kerschbaum et al .",
    "1999 ) that the hottest c - stars ( spectral type c0 ) are bluer than this limit .",
    "so , applying the same lower - limit on the broad - band colour will bias against the hottest c - stars .",
    "in this section the ( recent ) surveys for carbon stars in external galaxies , or new results in general , are described .",
    "a huge new survey of the lmc was presented by kontizas et al .",
    "( 2001 ) covering about 300 sq.degree and containing 7760 objects .",
    "i used the listed @xmath6 data to calculate the bolometric magnitude using bolometric corrections ( bcs ) from costa & frogel ( 1996 ; hereafter cf ) for a reddening of @xmath7 = 0.06 .",
    "kunkel et al . ( 2000 ) present a new survey of carbon stars in the periphery of the smc , and present @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and heliocentric velocities for 150 stars .",
    "it should be mentioned that the data release of the infra - red surveys denis and 2mass has allowed to identify many candidate agb stars based on colour criteria , e.g. egan et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who combine 2mass with msx data , to suggest about 500 candidate agb stars , or nikolaev & weinberg ( 2000 ) who analyse 2mass data to find that there is a significant population of agb stars . in the near future multi - object spectroscopy will assign spectral types and measure radial velocities for many of them .",
    "the total number of known carbon stars is 26 , with an estimated total of about 100 ( whitelock et al . 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath0 photometry is listed for 11 of them in whitelock et al .",
    "i correlated all 26 of them with 2mass , finding 14 matches , 9 also with photometry in whitelock et al .",
    "the object with the largest difference in @xmath10 , is the object classified by whitelock et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as a mira , actually the first confirmed mira - type variable in a dwarf spheroidal .",
    "the bolometric magnitudes for the 16 stars are calculated adopting @xmath7 = 0.15 and bcs from bessell & wood ( 1984 ; hereafter bw84 ) .",
    "azzopardi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) lists a total known number of 104 , with an estimated total of 120 .",
    "demers & irwin ( 1987 ) identify 30 long - period variables but none with mira - type amplitudes .",
    "bersier & wood ( 2002 ) give a list of 85 candidate lpvs .",
    "stetson et al . ( 1998 ) present a list of 161 candidate luminous red stars in a field of 1274 sq.arcmin based on @xmath8 and @xmath9 exposures .",
    "cross - identifications with demers & kunkel ( 1979 ) , westerlund et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and lundgren ( 1990 ) are also given .",
    "demers et al .",
    "( 2002 ) consider the 2mass observations in the direction of fornax and the lmc and use a selection in @xmath11 to identify 5 new candidates , and confirm 21 known carbon stars in fornax .",
    "i took the coordinates from stetson et al . and made a correlation with the 2mass catalogue in 2 steps . first using a search radius of 2 arcsec , finding 140 matches .",
    "plotting the offsets between the input coordinates and the 2mass coordinates revealed that there is an offset of 0.66 arcsec in ra and 1.10 arcsec in dec . in a second pass , the stetson et al .",
    "coordinates were corrected for this offset , and a search radius of 1.5 arcsec was used .",
    "152 matches were found , with an rms in the difference between 2mass and input coordinates now 0.42 arcsec in ra and 0.32 arcsec in dec .",
    "this sub - sample of 152 stars contains 41 c- , 7 s- and 19 m - stars .",
    "bolometric magnitudes are calculated adopting a reddening @xmath7 of 0.020 , and bcs to the @xmath10 magnitude from bw84 .",
    "figure  1 and 2 show the colour - colour and colour - magnitude diagram for these 152 red stars with 2mass counterparts . from both diagrams",
    "it is clear that the carbon stars stand out from the m- and s - stars , a feature that is well known and related to the different molecular absorption features in the nir .",
    "the carbon stars are on average more luminous than the m- and s - stars .",
    "note that the two reddest stars seem to have a relatively low luminosity again .",
    "this is likely to be an artifact , since these red colours are influenced by circumstellar reddening because of mass loss , and hence a simple bcs formulation to obtain @xmath12 may become inaccurate .    .@xmath13 and @xmath14 colours of m - stars ( with no mass loss ) derived from the spectra in fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "figure  3 shows the well - known correlation between metallicity and absolute visual magnitude .",
    "the interpretation being that the more luminous galaxies are also the more massive ones that have had more gas mass available to transform into stars and enrich the interstellar medium .",
    "there is a clear outlier , sagdig , but several research groups find a similar low metallicity for this galaxy ( see discussion in momany et al .",
    "2002 )    figure  4 shows the number of carbon stars in a galaxy versus @xmath15 represented in two ways .",
    "first , the total number of c - stars in a galaxy was estimated by simply multiplying the known number by the ratio of total surface area of a galaxy to the survey area . as for some galaxies",
    "the survey area is less than a few percent , this correction factor can be quite large ( and uncertain ) . to circumvent this",
    ", the bottom panel shows the surface density of carbon stars in the particular survey .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that it does not take into account the spatial variation of the density of carbon stars within a galaxy . in neither approach",
    "did i correct for the fact that we do not see these galaxies face - on .",
    "some interesting things can be noticed . there is a clear relation between the ( estimated ) total number of c - stars and @xmath16 , and there seems to be a maximum surface density of about 200 kpc@xmath17 averaged over a galaxy . in both plots",
    "ngc 55 , 300 and 2403 are clear outliers .",
    "these are the most distant galaxies surveyed , and one might suppose that the surveys have been incomplete . for ngc 55",
    "the explanation probably lies as well in the fact that we see this galaxy almost disk - on , and so both the total number as well as the surface density have been underestimated .",
    "reddening within the galactic disk of the galaxy can also play a role . for ngc 2403",
    "the small number of carbon stars lies in the fact that the survey has been incomplete .",
    "all 4 known c - stars have luminosities that are much higher than the average in galaxies for which we know the lf in more detail .",
    "the same is true for ngc 300 .",
    "a last note of caution is that i did not try to make a distinction between carbon stars on the tp - agb and lower - luminosity carbon stars .",
    "for example , the data for our galaxy represents tp - agb stars only , while on the other hand the smc is known to contain a large fraction of low - luminosity carbon stars ( see later ) .",
    "figure  5 shows the ratio of c- to late m - stars , and it confirms the well known trend ( cook et al .",
    "1986 , pritchet et al .",
    "the interpretation is that a star with a lower metallicity needs fewer thermal pulses to turn from an oxygen - rich star into a carbon star .",
    "figure  6 shows the ratio of the total estimated number of carbon stars over the visual luminosity of the galaxy ( e.g. aaronson et al .",
    "most of the galaxies scatter between a value of 3 and 4 , with a few outliers which are the same as noticed in fig .  2 .",
    "figure  7 shows the c - stars bolometric lf for the galaxies for which it could be constructed ( sect .",
    "2 ) ; for the magellanic clouds see groenewegen ( 1998 ) for details .",
    "table  3 lists the maximum , minimum and mean magnitude , as well as the spread , calculated from the rms deviation from the mean . also listed",
    "are the number of stars that went into the calculation and are plotted in fig .  7 , and the number of c - stars that are fainter than @xmath18 , the luminosity of the tip of the rgb .",
    "this is not an absolute foolproof limit between true agb stars and binary masqueraders as ( low initial mass ) genuine agb stars may have a luminosity fainter than @xmath18 when experiencing the first few pulses on the tp - agb and/or when they happen to be observed during the luminosity - dip of the thermal pulse cycle ( about 10 - 20% of the inter pulse time ) . as an aside",
    "it is noted that in the case the luminosity is not conclusive about the agb nature of an object , one could try to observe one or more technetium lines ( e.g. abia et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) , as the presence of this unstable isotope indicates recent nucleosynthesis .",
    "the data show that in well populated lfs , the mean @xmath12 is between 4 and 5 .",
    "it also shows that the mean in ngc 300 and ngc 2403 is much higher .",
    "unless one would invoke a large uncertainty in the distance or a burst of recent star formation , the most natural explanation lies in the incompleteness of the surveys in these distant galaxies .",
    "finally , the data shows that in the fainter galaxies the mean magnitude increases and that a fair number of c - stars are of the low - luminosity type .",
    "this is more clearly seen in fig .",
    "8 where the mean magnitude is plotted .",
    "a lf which is dominated by faint carbon stars is indicative of an absent intermediate age population , and a corresponding star formation history .",
    "it is also evident that there is a considerable spread at a given metallicity or @xmath16 , inhibiting the use of the mean carbon star luminosity as a distance indicator .",
    "in a recent paper mouhcine & lanon ( 2002 ) present evolutionary population synthesis models , including chemical evolution , with special focus on intermediate age populations .",
    "their models are the first that are able to account for the observed trend in fig .",
    "3 adopting ` typical ' sfh for sa , sb , sc and irr hubble type galaxies . the agb phase is included through a semi - analytical treatment of the third dredge - up , with efficiency parameters set to values that have been determined in other studies to fit the lmc carbon star lf and c / m ratio .",
    "in principle , the overall carbon star lf and c / m ratio contains information about the star - formation rate history from , say , 10 gyr ago ( the low - luminosity c - stars in binaries ) to a few - hundred myr ago ( the high luminosity tail of the lf ) . its a challenge to theoretical models to use these constraints together with other data to derive the chemical evolution and star formation history of these galaxies .",
    "the models of mouhcine & lanon represent a first successful step in this direction .",
    "+    i thank pierre royer ( kul ) for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation ."

    "<S> this is the unofficial proceeding of my invited review at the ringberg castle workshop on `` the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies '' , july 28th - august 2nd , 2002 , and presents an update of a similar review i gave in 1999 . </S>",

    "<S> although many carbon stars and late m - stars have been identified in local group galaxies , a coherent understanding in terms of the chemical evolution- and star formation history of a galaxy is still largely lacking . </S>",
    "<S> although a few major new surveys have been carried out over the last three years , the observational data is still incomplete in many respects : 1 ) for some of the larger galaxies only a small fraction in area has been surveyed so far , 2 ) surveys have been conducted using different techniques , and some of the older surveys are incomplete in bolometric magnitude , 3 ) only for some galaxies is there information about the late m - star population , or it is sometimes unpublished even when the data is available , 4 ) not all galaxies in the local group have been surveyed , 5 ) especially for some of the older work insufficient data is available to determine bolometric magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> i have correlated carbon star positions with the 2mass 2nd incremental data release to obtain @xmath0 , and bolometric magnitudes , to remedy this situation in some cases .    from the existing observations </S>",
    "<S> one can derive the following : the formation of carbon stars is both a function of metallicity and star - formation history . in galaxies with a similar star formation history , there will be relatively more carbon stars formed in the system with the lower metallicity . on the other hand , the scarcity of agb type carbon stars in some galaxies with the lowest metallicity indicates that these systems have had a low , if any , star - formation over the last few gyrs . </S>"
