    "since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite , numerous attempts have been proposed to explain the origin of this biggest mystery in modern cosmology .",
    "a vast class of models for cosmic acceleration invokes a scalar degree of freedom , @xmath0 , which may couple minimally or nonminimally to gravity and ordinary matter . in the case of nonminimal coupling , the models are commonly called modified gravity ( or `` dark gravity '' ) rather than dark energy , as @xmath0 participates in the long - range gravitational interactions and thereby accelerates the cosmic expansion .",
    "modified gravity models must be designed with care , because otherwise the effect of modification could persist down to small scales , which could easily be inconsistent with stringent tests in the solar system and laboratories .",
    "for this reason , screening mechanisms for scalar - mediated force are crucial .",
    "there are mainly two approaches for screening the scalar degree of freedom in modified gravity models .",
    "the first one is the chameleon mechanism  @xcite , by which the scalar acquires large mass in a high density environment .",
    "this is employed in viable @xmath1 gravity  @xcite , which is equivalent to a scalar - tensor theory with an appropriate potential .",
    "the second one is the vainshtein mechanism  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath0 s kinetic term becomes effectively large in the vicinity of matter due to some nonlinear derivative interaction , suppressing the effect of nonminimal coupling .",
    "the vainshtein screening is typical in galileon - like models  @xcite and nonlinear massive gravity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the vainshtein case",
    ", nonlinearities play an important role in possible recovery of usual gravity on small scales even in a weak gravity regime . to test models of modified gravity against experiments and cosmological observations , we therefore need to clarify the behavior of gravity around and below the scale at which the relevant nonlinearities set in . in this paper",
    ", we explore the consequences of the latter mechanism in detail , taking into account the nonlinear effect .",
    "we study gravity sourced by a density perturbation of nonrelativistic matter , on subhorizon scales in a cosmological background , using the ( quasi)static approximation .",
    "to provide generic results , we work in the most general scalar - tensor theory with second - order field equations  @xcite , which can be derived by generalizing the galileon theory  @xcite and therefore is expected to be endowed with the vainshtein mechanism . in the context of the galileon , previous works focus only on the scalar - field equation of motion to see the profile of ( the gradient of ) @xmath0 , ignoring gravity backreaction  @xcite . since our approach follows the cosmological perturbation theory on subhorizon scales  @xcite , the effect of metric perturbations can naturally be taken into account consistently .",
    "the results in this paper can be applied to various aspects of cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define the theory we consider and then present the equations governing the background cosmological dynamics in the next section . in sec .",

    "v we present some simple applications of our results and finally we conclude in sec .  vi . in appendix",

    "note in particular that if a constant piece is present in @xmath12 then it gives rise to the einstein - hilbert term .",
    "we assume that matter , described by @xmath13 , is minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ gg ] ) gives the most general scalar - tensor theory with second - order field equations in four dimensions .",

    "this is because @xmath35 could be larger than @xmath36 below certain scales , where @xmath37 is a typical length scale associated with @xmath38 which may be as large as the present hubble radius . [ as we will see",

    "thus , from the traceless equation  ( [ traceless - h ] ) we obtain @xmath49    the @xmath50 component of the gravitational field equations reads @xmath51 where @xmath52    finally , the equation of motion for @xmath0 reduces to @xmath53 where @xmath54 equations  ( [ trlseq ] ) , ( [ 00eq ] ) , and  ( [ seom ] ) , supplemented with the matter equations of motion ( see sec .  [ mdp ] ) govern the ( quasi)static behavior of the gravitational potentials and the scalar field on subhorizon scales .",
    "note that in deriving eqs .",
    "( [ 00eq ] ) and  ( [ seom ] ) we have neglected the `` mass terms '' @xmath55 and @xmath56 . these contributions could be larger than the higher spatial derivative terms , and in that case the fluctuation @xmath57 will not be excited .",

    "this fact will be used explicitly in the next section .",
    "we now want to consider a spherically symmetric overdensity on a cosmological background . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to use the coordinate @xmath63 .",

    "note also that in deriving eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) we have set the integration constants to be zero , requiring that @xmath75 is a solution if @xmath76 .    for sufficiently large @xmath68",
    ", we may neglect all the nonlinear terms in the above equations .",
    "the solution to the linear equations is given by @xmath77 where we defined @xmath78 .",
    "in this regime , the parametrized post - newtonian parameter @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 which in general differs from unity .      a simple example for which nonlinear terms can operate is the model with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath84 in this case , we have @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we also have the relation @xmath87    the lagrangian  ( [ gkgb ] ) corresponds to a nonminimally coupled version of kinetic gravity braiding  @xcite , and has been studied extensively in the context of inflation  @xcite and dark energy / modified gravity  @xcite .",
    "of course the nonminimal coupling can be undone by performing a conformal transformation , but in the present analysis we have no particular reason to do so .",

    "that in this case the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
