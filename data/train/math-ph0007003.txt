    "a surface is developable if it has zero intrinsic curvature everywhere ( with the exception of possible singular points and lines ) .",

    "a sheet may be smoothly bent into a portion of the surface of a cone or cylinder , but not into a portion of the surface of a sphere .",
    "the former are developable while the latter is not .",
    "consider a flat sheet smoothly bent into a portion of a cone or a cylinder without stretching as in fig  [ fig : develop ] . through each point on the surface , there exists at least one line , the _ generator _ , that is a geodesic ( straight line ) both in the sheet when it is flattened out in @xmath34 and in the sheet as it is embedded in @xmath35 .",
    "these generators can be characterized by the fact that @xmath19 and @xmath36 are two points on a generator if and only if @xmath37 , the distance between @xmath19 and @xmath36 on the sheet is the same as @xmath38 , the distance between the images @xmath21 and @xmath39 in the embedding space @xmath35 .",
    "thus , in these examples , given a point @xmath19 in the sheet , one can find a straight line that extends from @xmath19 to some point @xmath36 on the boundary .",
    "the length of this line in @xmath35 is equal to the distance between @xmath19 and @xmath36 in the sheet .",
    "consequently , no sphere whose diameter is smaller than half the diameter of the sheet can contain the sheet .",
    "= 0.7    we now consider a general isometric embedding of a @xmath10-disk in @xmath9 .",
    "we can choose global cartesian co - ordinates on the disk and also on @xmath9 .",
    "in these co - ordinates , the embedding is given by three real - valued function @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are cartesian co - ordinates on the disk .",
    "if we let @xmath42 denote a vector valued function with components @xmath43 , the _ strain _ is given by @xcite @xmath44 and the curvature is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the unit normal to the surface .",
    "the _ principal curvatures _ are the eigenvalues of the symmetric matrix @xmath47 .",
    "the _ gaussian curvature _ is defined as the product of the principal curvatures .    to show the existence of generators for all isometric immersions of a flat sheet in @xmath35 , we need gauss _ theorema egregium _ @xcite .",
    "this theorem asserts that the isometric immersion yields a developable surface , so that the gaussian curvature is zero everywhere .",
    "consequently , at least one of the principal curvatures is zero at every point on the surface .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the center of the 2-disk that is embedded in @xmath33 .",
    "we first consider the case where only one principal curvature is zero at @xmath19 . since",
    "only one principal curvature is zero , there is a unique generator through @xmath19 .",
    "it can be shown that this generator can be extended until it runs into the boundary of the disk at @xmath36 . since the image of the generator @xmath48 in @xmath35 is also a straight line , @xmath49 implies that @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , the sheet can not be embedded inside a shell with a diameter less than @xmath51 .",
    "we now consider the remaining case : that _ both _ principal curvatures vanish at @xmath19 . in this case , there is nt a unique generator through @xmath19 .",
    "further , not every local generator through @xmath19 need be extendible as a straight line in the embedding space ( @xmath35 ) all the way to the boundary as is evident from fig .",

    "[ fig : brkn_sgmnt ] ) .",
    "since the point @xmath55 has one nonzero principal curvature , from the argument in the previous paragraph , it follows that there exists a point @xmath57 on the boundary such that the image of the geodesic @xmath58 in the sheet is a straight line in @xmath35 .",
    "if the curvature is everywhere bounded , by making @xmath59 sufficiently small , we can make the angles between the segments @xmath58 and @xmath52 virtually the same in both the sheet and in the space so that @xmath60 is as small as we please .",
    "= 0.7    we will now show this rigorously .",
    "the difference between @xmath61 and @xmath62 is due to two factors .",
    "one contributing factor is that the small segment @xmath63 is flat in the sheet but curved in the embedding space , so that @xmath64 .",
    "however , both these lengths are small , since they are bounded by @xmath65 , and the contribution of this segment to @xmath60 is bounded by @xmath66 .",
    "another contributing factor is that , since the curvature is not zero on the segment @xmath63 , the angles between the straight segments @xmath52 and @xmath58 in the embedding space and in the sheet are not equal .",
    "let @xmath67 denote the angle between the segments @xmath52 and @xmath58 in the sheet and let @xmath68 be the angle between the images of these segments in the embedding space . since the curvature is a measure of the rate of change of the angle that a tangent vector makes with respect to a fixed axis , it is easily seen that @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a bound on the components of the curvature tensor @xmath71 . since the segments @xmath52 and @xmath58 are straight both in the sheet and in the embedding space , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "also , @xmath74 . combining the estimates @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 with the results from above and using @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the radius of the disk , we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant .",
    "note that the bound on the right hand side reflects the contributions of both the factors  the term @xmath66 is the contribution from the length of the segment @xmath63 , and the term @xmath82 is the contribution from the difference between the angles @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "now , we choose a sequence @xmath83 and repeat this construction with @xmath84 , for each @xmath85 .",
    "this will yield a point @xmath86 on the boundary with @xmath87 so that @xmath88 as @xmath89 .",
    "since the boundary of the unit disk is compact , the sequence @xmath90 has an accumulation point @xmath36 on the boundary and there exists a subsequence @xmath91 that converges to @xmath36 . from the above estimate , it follows that @xmath92 and @xmath49 implies that the disk can not be isometrically embedded inside a spherical shell with a diameter less than @xmath51 .",

    "[ sec : thm ] , is along the same lines as the argument above for developable surfaces in @xmath35 . now",
    "the local curvature is a vector - valued tensor rather than a scalar - valued tensor , so that there are no obvious `` principal curvatures '' and no obvious generalization of the gaussian curvature .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that there are analogs of the local generators .",
    "in the situation @xmath32 , lemma  [ lem : kernel ] along with corollary  [ cor : null ] asserts that there exists at least one line through the point @xmath19 in the @xmath0-sheet that has zero curvature in the embedding space at @xmath19 .",

    ", there exists a sequence @xmath603 with @xmath604 . using the compactness of @xmath590 to extract a subsequence that converges and using the continuity of @xmath605 and @xmath606",
    ", it follows that there exists a @xmath607 such that @xmath608 .",
    "therefore , @xmath609",
    "the theorem proved above sheds light on the global consequences of requiring that an embedding be isometric .",
    "though the isometry condition is a local one , it leads to a global constraint on the minimal span of the embedding .",
    "the interest of this theorem is in identifying more general constraints of this nature . in this section",
    "we discuss possible generalizations and limitations of the theorem .",
    "the mere existence of global geometric constraints arising from local ones is not surprising .",
    "for example if our @xmath0-dimensional manifold is replaced by a @xmath12-dimensional solid , all the isometric embeddings are related by rigid motions . in particular , every geodesic in the manifold is then a geodesic in the embedding space .",
    "the interest of the embeddings studied above is that a global constraint exists despite substantial allowed deformations of the manifold .",
    "each point has many possibilities for bending deformation .",
    "a given straight line in the manifold may bend and twist in many directions . yet",
    "the constraints among these bending modes due to the isometry condition are sufficient to force the existence of at least one line through any given point in the manifold that is also a geodesic in the embedding space and which runs all the way to the boundary .",
    "this gives a certain `` rigidity '' to the sheet in the sense that it can not be deformed isometrically into an arbitrarily small sphere .",
    "note that this `` rigidity '' of an @xmath0-sheet in @xmath7 for @xmath610 is a global phenomenon in the following sense . for the confinement of an @xmath0-sheet , we can always find a smooth ``",
    "local '' isometry , that is , given any small ball @xmath3 , and a point @xmath19 in the @xmath0-sheet , we can find an open neighborhood @xmath93 of @xmath19 such that there exists a smooth isometry @xmath611 provided @xmath13 .",
    "a consequence of the fact that there exist such `` local '' isometries is that this `` global rigidity '' may be easily compromised .",
    "though a smooth two - dimensional sheet may not be embedded in a small sphere , a sheet with creases or folds may be readily embedded . to remove the rigidity , it suffices to violate the smoothness requirement on a set of measure zero . for a 2-sheet in 3-space , violation of smoothness at isolated points",
    "is not sufficient ; though violation on a union of one - dimensional manifolds ( the folds ) is sufficient .",
    "an interesting question is the nature of the minimal set on which we will have to violate the smoothness requirement in order to embed an @xmath0-sheet in an arbitrarily small @xmath12-sphere where @xmath32 .",
    "one natural way to weaken the isometry constraint is to treat the manifold as an elastic object , with a local energy quadratic in the strain that measures the departure from isometry .",
    "if such an object is forced into a small sphere , what shape minimizes this energy ?",
    "simple examples suggest that , in the limit that the thickness of the sheet goes to zero , the least costly form of deformation is to concentrate all the strain in a small subset of the entire sheet ",
    "the _ singular set _ , rather than deforming smoothly in which case the strain",
    "is distributed over the entire sheet .",
    "the energy of the smooth deformation is typically much larger than the energy of the singular deformation for embeddings with @xmath32 . in a real elastic 2-sheet",
    "embedded in 3 dimensions , this singular deformation is limited by the finite thickness of the sheet . however , the width of the singular region scales as a fractional power of the thickness  @xcite , leading to an intriguing boundary - layer behavior .",
    "the properties of these boundaries or ridges of elastic 2-sheets confined in 3 dimensions have been recently explored by energy - balance arguments , numerical calculations and classical boundary - layer analysis  @xcite .",
    "the singular regions anticipated in the confinement of elastic manifolds resemble the topological defects seen in various condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "a classical example of a topological singularity is the whorl singularity that arises if one attempts to put a smooth non - zero vector field on a sphere .",
    "a well known result from topology , analogous to our result in theorem  [ thm : crumple ] , is that there is no smooth everywhere non - zero vector field on a sphere @xcite .",
    "note however , that there do exist smooth , everywhere nonzero , vector fields on any proper subset of the sphere .",
    "consequently , there exist everywhere non - zero vector fields on a sphere that are smooth everywhere except at a single point , which is the singular set in this case .",
    "this is very similar to the singularities in a crumpled sheet , where , as discussed above , one has to violate the smoothness requirement only on a small subset of the entire sheet .",
    "these topological singularities are explored in homotopy theory , where one studies the mappings of a group into another group .",
    "the topological singularities arise from the group structure of the groups in consideration in contrast to our case where we map a manifold into a manifold , and the singularities arise from the presumed metric properties of the manifolds .",
    "one may ask what useful knowledge emerges from our high - dimensional analysis .",
    "the specialization of our theorem to three - dimensional embedding leads only to the well - known properties of developable surfaces , as noted in the introduction .",
    "embedding in spaces of more than three dimensions has no obvious realization . yet",
    "physical phenomena often find natural expressions in terms of high - dimensional spaces .",
    "quasi - crystals may be elegantly described as three - dimensional slices in a six - dimensional crystal  @xcite .",
    "string theory and its recent generalizations  @xcite describe elementary particles and relativistic interfaces as manifolds embedded in high - dimensional spaces .",
    "finally , the dynamics of a material object is conventionally described by embedding the three - dimensional array of particle labels into the six - dimensional space of co - ordinates and momenta .",
    "the constraints explored here may have implications for these cases .",
    "in conclusion , we will point out some of the avenues for future work .",
    "one class of interesting questions is about extending our result .",
    "[ fig : tooflat ] strongly suggests that the following result is true for the case of a 2-sheet embedded in 3 dimensions ",
    "if @xmath109 is the index of relative nullity at a point @xmath19 in the sheet , there is a @xmath109 simplex @xmath612 with its @xmath613 vertices on the boundary of the sheet , such that @xmath612 contains @xmath19 and @xmath612 is totally geodesic in the sheet as well as in the embedding space .",
    "this is true for almost every point in the sheet .",
    "the only points where this does nt hold for the embedding in fig .",
    "[ fig : tooflat ] is at three isolated points on the boundary of the sheet , which have @xmath356 , but have no straight lines of finite length containing them that are flat in the embedding .",
    "every other point in one of the regions with one curved direction lies on a generator , which is a straight segment of finite length with end points on the boundary .",
    "also , every point in the region with two flat directions , lies in the inner triangle which is a @xmath10-simplex with three vertices on the boundary .",
    "this is certainly more general than our result , which only says that there is a line segment containing @xmath19 and a point on the boundary , that is totally geodesic in the sheet and the embedding space .",
    "we believe such a general result will hold , for this case of a 2-sheet in 3 dimensions and also for the general case of embedding an @xmath0-sheet in @xmath12-dimensions and we will investigate this question further in the future .",
    "another interesting question is generalizing our results to the situation where the sheets and the embedding space are not intrinsically flat , our theorem is restricted to flat manifolds mapped into flat embedding spaces . but",
    "the notion of isometric embedding readily generalizes to curved manifolds and curved embedding spaces .",
    "there must be restrictions on how close together the manifold points can be brought , analogous to those of our theorem .",
    "to formulate the proper generalization of our theorem is a challenging task .",
    "hopefully the ideas above will provide a helpful framework for this task .",
    "finally , one might investigate what other kinds of local constraints will lead to global constraints analogous to those found here . by analogy with crumpling",
    ", we would expect that such local constraints will give the system a global rigidity which can be destroyed by violating the local constraints on small regions in the system .",
    "this may prove useful in the understanding of various phenomena in continuum physics where large scale forcing of a system can lead to strong non - uniformities or nearly singular behavior in small localized regions .",
    "we will use @xmath614 to denote the euclidean length of the vector @xmath615 .",
    "a set @xmath616 is _ open _ , if every point @xmath617 is an interior point , that is there exists an @xmath30 such that @xmath618 . in what follows , by the neighborhood of a point @xmath619 , we will mean an open set @xmath93 containing @xmath620 .    a ( smooth ) @xmath85-dimensional",
    "manifold is a set @xmath15 with a collection of sets @xmath621 where @xmath612 is an index set such that    1 .",
    "the collection @xmath622 covers @xmath15 , that is @xmath623 2 .   for every @xmath624",

    "3 .   if @xmath627 , the map @xmath628 is smooth ( @xmath629 ) where @xmath630 .    in the rest of this appendix",
    ", we will assume that @xmath15 is a @xmath85-dimensional manifold .",
    "the definition above can be paraphrased as follows : every point in @xmath15 has a neighborhood that looks like ( is in a one - to - one correspondence ) with an open subset of @xmath8 .",
    "this correspondence gives a system of co - ordinates on this neighborhood . if there is more than one way to put co - ordinates on a neighborhood of a point , the transformations between the various sets of co - ordinates are smooth .",
    "the set @xmath631 is called a co - ordinate patch and the function @xmath632 is a co - ordinate system . the co - ordinates enable us to go back and forth between euclidean spaces and general manifolds and this allows one to extend notions like continuity and smoothness which are defined for functions between euclidean spaces to the case of functions between manifolds .",
    "for instance , given a function @xmath633 and a point @xmath24 , we can choose a co - ordinate patch @xmath631 containing @xmath19 and use the associated co - ordinate system @xmath632 to define a function @xmath634 , where @xmath626 is an open subset of @xmath8 as defined above .",
    "this procedure enables us to extend notions of differentiability and smoothness to function @xmath635 .",
    "we will say that @xmath636 is differentiable ( smooth ) at a point @xmath19 if @xmath637 is differentiable ( smooth ) at @xmath638 . likewise , a function @xmath639 is differentiable ( smooth ) at a point @xmath640 , if @xmath641 is smooth at @xmath642 , where @xmath632 is a co - ordinate system on a patch @xmath631 containing @xmath643 .",

    "we will call the vector @xmath664 defined by this procedure the tangent vector to the curve at @xmath19 and denote it by @xmath665 or @xmath666 .",
