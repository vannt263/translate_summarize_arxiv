    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ; including qsos ) are essentially a kind of radiation and line - emitting systems powered by gravitational accretion onto suppermassive black holes .",
    "the global spectra of agns are remarkably similar , emission lines with similar intensity ratios sitting atop a blue continuum that has a similar slope among agns regardless of their luminosities and redshifts ( davidson & netzer 1979 , korista 1999 ) .",
    "however , this similarity is only a zeroth - order approximation ; in 1977 , baldwin found that , among the qso ensemble , the equivalent width ( ew ) of the civ  @xmath11549 emission line correlates negatively with the continuum luminosity ( baldwin 1977 ) . from then on ,",
    "such a negative ew ",
    "l correlation has been found for almost all emission lines in the ultraviolet and optical bands , and has been termed as `` baldwin effect '' ( hereafter beff ; see osmer & shields 1999 , sheilds 2007 for reviews ) .",
    "furthermore , also found are the three kinds of 2nd - order effects of the beff , namely , the dependence of the beff slope ( the slope of the logew  logl relation ) on luminosity , on ionization energy , and , particularly , on velocity . the civ  beff is stronger in the peak and red wing than in the blue ( francis & koratkar 1995 , richards et al . 2002 ) !",
    "the velocity dependence betrays the nature of the beff : this kind of negative correlation relates to the line - emitting gas gravitationally bound in the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "in order to explore the origin and the underlying mechanism of the beff , based on the homogeneous sample of 4178 @xmath2 seyfert 1s and qsos with median spectral s / n @xmath3 per pixel in the sdss dr4 , we have conducted a systematic investigation of the line  line and line  continuum correlations for broad and narrow emission lines in the near - uv and optical , from mgii  @xmath4 to [ oiii ]  @xmath5 .",
    "our findings are as follows : + ( i ) the strongest correlations of almost all the emission - line intensity ratios and ews are with @xmath0 , either positively ( e.g. feii  ew ) or negatively ( e.g. mgii  ew ) , rather than with @xmath6 or @xmath7 ; besides , generally intensity ratios have tighter correlations with @xmath0  than the ews of the related lines .",
    "+ ( ii ) the intensity ratios of feii  emissions  both narrow and broad  to mgii  have very strong , positive correlations with @xmath0 ; interestingly enough , ( narrow feii  @xmath8)/mgii  has a stronger correlation with @xmath0  than the optical and uv ( broad feii)/mgii , with spearman @xmath9= 0.74 versus 0.58 ( optical ) and 0.46 ( uv ) ; see fig . 1 ( dong et al . 2009a ) .",
    "these findings argue that eddington ratio ( @xmath10 ) ) , by definition , is the luminosity at which the gravity of the central source acting on an electron ",
    "proton pair ( i.e. fully ionized gas ) is balanced by the radiation pressure due to electron thomson scattering ; @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16are the gravitational constant , speed of light , mass of the central source , proton mass , thomson scattering cross - section , respectively . in accretion - powered radiation systems , @xmath0",
    "is often referred to as _ dimensionless accretion rate @xmath17 _ ( the relative accretion rate normalized by eddington accretion rate @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 being mass accretion rate and @xmath21 the accretion efficiency ) as @xmath17 is not an observable ; yet the two notations are different both in meaning and in scope of application . even in the accretion - powered radiation systems like agns ,",
    "@xmath0  ( @xmath6 ) is not equivalent to @xmath17 ( @xmath20 ) except in the simple thin accretion disk model of shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "therefore , we would rather call @xmath0__dimensionless luminosity _ _ ( @xmath22 ) . ]",
    "is the origin of the beff , as of other regularities of almost all emission lines ( e.g. , the feii[oiii ]  anticorrelation , boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "this once has been suggested by baskin & laor ( 2004 ) and bachev et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the civ  beff .",
    "we propose that the underlying physics is certain self - regulation mechanisms caused by ( or corresponding to ) @xmath0 ; these mechanisms maintain the normal dynamically quasi - steady states of the gas surrounding the central engine of agns ( dong et al .",
    "2009a , b ) .",
    "briefly , the essential one is that _ there is a lower limit on the column density ( @xmath23 ) of the clouds gravitationally bound in the agn line - emitting region , set by @xmath0 _",
    "( hereafter the @xmath23@xmath0  mechanism ; see also fig . 1 of fabian et al .",
    "2006 , marconi et al .",
    "as @xmath0  increases , the emission strength decreases for high - ionization lines ( e.g. civ ) and optically thick lines that are emitted at the illuminated surface ( e.g. ly@xmath24 ) or in the thin transition layer ( e.g. mgii ) of the blr clouds ; for low - ionization , optically thin lines such as feii  multiplets that originate from the volume behind the hydrogen ionization front ( i.e. , from the ionization - bounded clouds only ) , as @xmath0  increases the emission strength increases . is linked tightly to @xmath17 anyway ( cf .",
    "footnote 2 ; merloni & heinz 2008 ) .",
    "thus there is an additional effect associated with @xmath22 yet directly via @xmath17 as follows .",
    "the increase in @xmath22 means , meanwhile , the increase in @xmath17 , the gas supply .",
    "reasonably , it is from the supplied gas spiraling into the central engine that ( at least a significant part of ) the line - emitting clouds originate ; this is particularly true for the blr and inner nlr clouds that are located between the torus ( as the fuel reservoir ) and the accretion disk ( e.g. gaskell & goosman 2008 ) .",
    "hence , as @xmath22 increases , the total mass of line - emitting gas increases . ] this is schematically sketched in fig .",
    "@xmath25 an implication is that bg92 s pc1 , if only the spectral correlations in the uv  optical are concerned , shares the same origin with pc2 that is exactly the heii beff .",
    "a lesson is that we should be more cautious about the premises of blind source separation methods such as principal component analysis .    @xmath26 as suggested insightfully by g.  richards ( e.g. richards 2006 ) , _ the civ  line blueshifting ( in other words , blue asymmetry ) is the same phenomenon of beff_. the underlying physical picture is clear now : there are two components in the civ  emission , one arising from outflows and the other from the clouds gravitationally bound in the blr ; the fraction of bound clouds that optimally emit civ  line decreases with increasing @xmath0  according to the @xmath23  ",
    "@xmath0  mechanism .",
    "@xmath27 if the observed large scatter of feii / mgii  at the same redshift is caused predominately by the diversity of @xmath0 , then once this systematic variation is corrected according to the tight feii / mgii  ",
    "@xmath0  correlation , it is hopeful to still use feii / mgii  as a measure of the fe / mg abundance ratio and thus a cosmic clock ( _ at least in a statistical manner _ ) .",
    "this appendix is to present more results taken from dong et al .",
    "( 2009b ) that did not appear in the proceedings paper due to page limit .",
    "the aim is to show that the traditional beff  the dependence of emission - line ews on luminosity  is likely not to be fundamental , but derived from the dependence on eddington ratio ( @xmath22 ) . to avoid any confusion , below we call the latter ell effect ( _ ell _ stands for @xmath22 , eddingtion ratio ) .",
    "the ell effect is the 1st - order small variation to the 0th - order global similarity of qso spectra that is well explained by `` locally optically - emitting clouds '' ( loc ) photoionization modeling ( baldwin et al . 1995 ) .",
    "as discussed above , in the study of the qso emission - line correlations , the focus seems to be shifting from the physics ( _ microphysics _ ) mainly of the accretion process to the ` statistical physics ' ( _ macrophysics _ ) of the surrounding clouds ( korista 1999 ; korista , private communication ) . with more realistic constraints to be accounted for [ e.g. , the distribution function of the cloud number with @xmath22 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; cf .",
    "2 ] , the 1st - order regularities and even the 2nd - order effects of qso emission lines ( see  1 ) may be reproduced exactly by future loc modeling .",
    "3 confirms that @xmath22 is the primary driver of the beff of mgii  @xmath4 .",
    "4 shows that , at the 0th - order approximation , mgii  luminosity is directly proportional to the continuum luminosity , exactly as predicted by photoionization theory ; at the 1th - order approximation , for different @xmath22 the proportional coefficient is different , @xmath30  this is just the ell effect illustrated in fig . 3c .",
    "some researchers once have found that the slopes of the emission line versus continuum luminosity relations in the log  log scale is not unity ( see references in  2 of shields 2007 ) .",
    "we must note that this is likely not to be intrinsic ( see dong et al .",
    "2009b for a detailed investigation ) .",
    "it is caused partly by selection effect inherent in any magnitude - limited sample , with high - luminosity objects having higher @xmath22 and thus smaller ews . for optical emission lines particularly ( e.g. h@xmath31 ) , this is mainly caused by the contamination of the host - galaxy starlight ( cf .",
    "croom et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the starlight contamination aggravates gradually towards longer wavelengths ; moreover , within a fixed aperture , it aggravates with decreasing agn luminosity .         with @xmath23  ( panel a ) and of the total volume @xmath32 with @xmath23  ( panel b ) of the clouds bound in the broad - line region and inner narrow - line region of agns .",
    "the sketches are plotted assuming the distribution of the cloud number to be @xmath33 with @xmath34 ; the lower - limit @xmath23  cutoff is set by the @xmath23@xmath0  mechanism , roughly scaling with @xmath0 .",
    "note that the strengths of high - ionization lines ( e.g. civ ) and optically - thick lines ( e.g. ly@xmath24  and mgii ) are roughly proportional to @xmath35 while that of low - ionization , optically - thin lines such as narrow - line and broad - line feiiroughly proportional to @xmath32 ( dong et al .",
