    "recent literature @xcite has been witness to an interesting debate on the question of a possible @xmath3-violating difference in the partial widths of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays , into conjugate channels such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this discussion has taken place in the context of a model in which the decays of the top quark are mediated , not only by @xmath12 bosons , but also by charged higgs bosons @xmath13 with @xmath3-violating couplings @xcite .",
    "two specific questions that have arisen in this regard are ( i ) the correct form of the propagator for an unstable @xmath14 boson @xcite , and ( ii ) the implications of @xmath9 invariance and unitarity for partial rate asymmetries generated by absorptive parts of decay amplitudes @xcite.in this paper , we present an analysis that , we believe , is more complete than that in refs . @xcite .",
    "central to our analysis is the derivation of the propagator matrix of the coupled @xmath6 system , taking account of vacuum polarization effects induced by fermion loops .",
    "the propagator matrix includes off - diagonal transitions between @xmath4 and @xmath2 , which turn out to be essential for obtaining a partial rate asymmetry that respects the constraints of @xmath9 invariance .",
    "the model we use is defined by the lagrangian @xcite @xmath15\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\overline u\\gamma^{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_5)dw_{\\mu}^++\\overline d \\gamma^{\\mu}(1-\\gamma_5)uw_{\\mu}^-\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( u , d)\\to ( c , s)+(u , d)\\to ( t , b)\\biggr\\},\\\\ { \\cal   l}_h&=&\\frac{g}{2\\sqrt 2}\\biggl\\{-\\sum_{l = e,\\mu , \\tau}\\bigl [ h^+z \\frac{m_l}{m_w}\\overline { \\nu}_l(1+\\gamma_5)l+h^-z^*\\frac{m_l}{m_w } \\overline l(1-\\gamma_5)\\nu_l\\bigr ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + h^+\\overline u\\bigl [ y\\frac{m_u}{m_w}(1-\\gamma_5)+x\\frac{m_d}{m_w } ( 1+\\gamma_5)\\bigr ] d\\nonumber\\\\ & & + h^-\\overline d\\bigl [ x^*\\frac{m_d}{m_w}(1-\\gamma_5)+y^*\\frac{m_u } { m_w}(1+\\gamma_5)\\bigr ] u\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( u , d)\\to ( c , s)+(u , d)\\to ( t , b)\\biggr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we neglect quark - mixing . the parameters @xmath16 appearing in @xmath17 are permitted to be complex relative to one another , so that this term is @xmath3-violating .",
    "the interaction @xmath17 may be imagined to arise as a special case of the weinberg model with three higgs doublets @xcite , in which the remaining charged scalars are sufficiently heavy to be disregarded .",
    "we are concerned with the propagator ( in unitary gauge ) of the coupled @xmath6 system , which we describe by a @xmath5 matrix @xmath18 the inverse of this matrix is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the metric tensor with elements @xmath21 .",

    "the function @xmath32 , representing the @xmath33 element of the propagator matrix , can be decomposed into transverse and longitudinal pieces : @xmath34 with @xmath35 it will turn out that only the longitudinal part @xmath36 contributes to the partial width asymmetry .",
    "if the term proportional to @xmath37 is dropped , the function @xmath36 coincides with that in refs . @xcite .",
    "we work initially with the full expression in eq .",
    "( 8) , in order to obtain results that are also valid for @xmath38 , a region that is physically accessible if @xmath39 .",
    "the amplitude of the decay @xmath40 , including vacuum polarization effects in the @xmath41 propagator , is given by the sum of the four diagrams shown in fig .",

    "by contrast , the leading term of our result ( eq .",

    "we have been able to trace the difference to the neglect of the off - diagonal part of the @xmath6 propagator in refs .",
    "@xcite , which inevitably leads to a violation of the @xmath9 condition ( eq . ( 25 ) ) .",
    "+ ( v ) in the absence of any scalar interaction of the form @xmath17 , the transverse and longitudinal parts of the propagator @xmath32 obtained by us agree with those in refs . @xcite .",
    "+ ( vi ) numerically , the partial width asymmetries resulting from @xmath6 interference , in the models discussed here , are exceedingly small . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , larger differences between @xmath10 and @xmath101 occur if one compares the spectra of these reactions , not only in the variable @xmath102 but also in the complementary dalitz variable @xmath103 @xcite .",
