    "since the discovery of neutrino oscillations , many models of neutrino mass have been constructed .",
    "the most straightforward is to incorporate dirac neutrino masses into the standard model ( sm ) by introducing three ( or two  @xcite ) right - handed neutrinos @xmath2 coupled to the sm higgs doublet @xmath3 analogously to the sm quarks and charged leptons .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian becomes , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the conjugate of the higgs doublet , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the left - handed quark and lepton doublets , respectively , and a sum over the generation indices @xmath8 is implied .",
    "this implementation has two problems .",
    "first , realistic dirac neutrino masses below @xmath9  ev require nine independent dimensionless yukawa couplings @xmath10 .",
    "second , the right - handed neutrinos @xmath2 are uncharged under the sm gauge group , so that majorana mass terms @xmath11 are allowed by the gauge symmetry .",
    "the majorana mass terms can be eliminated by imposing a global symmetry such as lepton number .",
    "alternatively , a large majorana mass for the right - handed neutrinos leads to naturally light left - handed majorana neutrinos via the type-1 seesaw  @xcite , @xmath12 , where @xmath13  gev is the sm higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "this possibility motivates the experimental search for neutrinoless double beta decay , which can happen only if the neutrino is a majorana particle .",
    "most other neutrino mass models also yield majorana neutrinos .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a minimal model for _ dirac _ neutrino masses that does not require tiny neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "our motivation is to provide a viable , renormalizable model with minimal new field content which appears entirely below the tev scale .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino masses relative to those of the quarks and charged leptons is explained by sourcing them from a second higgs doublet @xmath14 with a tiny vev @xmath15  ev .",
    "the second higgs doublet yields two neutral scalars and a charged scalar pair at the electroweak scale , providing signatures at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) that can be used to discriminate the model from other neutrino mass models and to extract new information about the neutrino masses .",
    "the charged scalar also contributes to the lepton flavor violating decay @xmath0 at a rate potentially within reach of the currently - running meg experiment , which would provide additional sensitivity to the model parameters .",
    "the model can be made consistent with all existing experimental constraints , including standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) which generally constrains models with new light degrees of freedom .",
    "the second doublet has the additional benefit of allowing a heavier sm - like higgs boson to be consistent with the precision electroweak data , thereby easing the fine - tuning problem of a light higgs boson  @xcite .    in the next two sections we describe the model and",
    "show that consistency with bbn can be achieved by keeping the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath16 below about @xmath17 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] we discuss the phenomenology .",
    "after considering the decay modes of the new higgs bosons , we derive a constraint on the charged higgs mass from existing data from the cern large electron - positron ( lep ) collider .",
    "we then address predictions for @xmath0 .",
    "we also show that the model is consistent with constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment and tree - level muon and tau decay .",
    "we finish with a discussion of lhc search prospects for the charged higgs and possible effects on the phenomenology of the sm - like higgs .",
    "finally we summarize our conclusions in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the field content is that of the sm with the addition of a new scalar doublet @xmath14with the same gauge quantum numbers as the sm higgs doublet @xmath3and three gauge - singlet right - handed neutrino fields @xmath18 which will pair up with the three left - handed neutrinos of the sm to form dirac particles .",
    "we impose a global u(1 ) symmetry under which the new fields @xmath14 and @xmath18 carry charge @xmath19 while all sm fields are uncharged .",
    "this u(1 ) symmetry is needed to forbid majorana mass terms for the @xmath18 while simultaneously enforcing a yukawa coupling structure in which only @xmath14 couples to right - handed neutrinos . the 4th term in eq .",
    "[ eq : smyuk ] is then replaced according to @xmath20 if the u(1 ) symmetry is unbroken , @xmath14 has zero vev and the neutrinos are strictly massless  @xcite .",
    "an identical yukawa structure can be obtained using a @xmath21 symmetry , as in the models of refs .",
    "@xcite ; however , this does not forbid majorana mass terms for @xmath18 .    in order to generate a vev for @xmath14",
    ", we break the global u(1 ) _ explicitly _ using a dimension-2 term in the higgs potential of the form @xmath22 .",
    "this results in a seesaw - like relation  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass of the neutral pseudoscalar ( defined below ) . for @xmath25  gev",
    ", @xmath15  ev is achieved for @xmath26 of order ( a few hundred kev)@xmath27 . by breaking the global u(1 )",
    "explicitly we avoid an extremely light scalar as is present in the model of ref .",

    "\\label{eq : potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can choose @xmath26 real and positive without loss of generality by rephasing @xmath14 and putting the excess phase into @xmath29 , which is already a general complex matrix .",
    "stability of the potential requires @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "note that even after the global u(1 ) is broken , conventional lepton number survives as an accidental symmetry of the model .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay is thus absent . , which yields a majorana mass term for the left - handed neutrinos of order @xmath33  mev  compare effective electron neutrino majorana masses @xmath34  mev for the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy and @xmath35  mev for the normal hierarchy ( except for a possible cancellation region ) if the neutrinos are majorana particles  @xcite .",
    "because the rate for neutrinoless double beta decay is proportional to the square of the effective electron neutrino majorana mass , a planck - suppressed majorana mass term would yield a neutrinoless double beta decay rate of order @xmath36 times smaller than the ultimate reach of the 100-ton - scale experiments  @xcite proposed to probe the normal hierarchy in majorana neutrino scenarios . ]    the mass - squared parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 suffer from large radiative corrections with quadratic sensitivity to the high - scale cutoff of the theory , just as the sm higgs mass - squared parameter does .",
    "the resulting hierarchy problem could be solved as in the sm by embedding our model into a supersymmetric or strong - dynamics theory at the tev scale .",
    "note however that because @xmath26 is the _ only _ source of breaking of the global u(1 ) , its size is technically natural  radiative corrections to @xmath26 are proportional to @xmath26 itself and are only logarithmically sensitive to the cutoff .",
    "the smallness of @xmath26 required in our model could thus be explained by higher - scale physics ; e.g. , through spontaneous breaking of the u(1 ) in a hidden sector which is then communicated to the higgs sector by heavy messenger particles or at high loop order .",
    "we minimize the potential with the following considerations .",
    "@xmath3 must obtain the usual sm higgs vev through spontaneous symmetry breaking with @xmath39 ; neglecting @xmath26 and @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 . to avoid a pseudo  nambu - goldstone boson with mass @xmath42 , the global u(1 )",

    "can be ignored when @xmath50 , as we assume here .",
    "the physical masses are , @xmath51 where we again neglect terms suppressed by @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are degenerate and can be lighter or heavier than @xmath1 depending on the sign of @xmath54 . note that a mass splitting @xmath55 of either sign in this model yields a positive contribution to the @xmath56 parameter  @xcite , which serves to increase the best - fit value for the sm - like higgs mass @xmath57 in the electroweak fit .",
    "this eases the tension  @xcite between the standard electroweak fit , which prefers a light higgs in the sm , and the lower bound on the sm higgs mass from lep .",
    "it also eases the `` little hierarchy problem , '' i.e. , the fine - tuning of the higgs mass - squared parameter against radiative corrections required for a cutoff above 1  tev  @xcite .    in the limit @xmath58",
    "the yukawa couplings of the new scalars are given by @xmath59,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , for which we use the convention of ref .",
    "in particular , the scalar yukawa couplings are entirely fixed by neutrino - sector parameters and the vev @xmath40 of the second doublet .",
    "the scalars also couple among themselves ; neglecting couplings suppressed by @xmath40 , the feynman rules for all triple - scalar couplings in the model are @xmath61 for the @xmath62 vertex , @xmath63 for the @xmath64 and @xmath65 vertices , and @xmath66 for the @xmath67 vertex .",
    "in our model the right - handed neutrino degrees of freedom will be populated in the early universe due , e.g. , to @xmath68 via t - channel @xmath1 exchange . the model is thus constrained by the limit on new relativistic degrees of freedom during bbn , @xmath69  @xcite at 95% confidence level ( cl ) . to evade this bound",
    ", the right - handed neutrinos must be colder than the left - handed neutrinos , @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "this can be achieved if the right - handed neutrinos drop out of thermal equilibrium early enough ; in terms of the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath71 at the times of decoupling of the left- and right - handed neutrinos we have @xmath72 .",
    "inserting @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 photon and @xmath75 @xmath76 and @xmath77 spin degrees of freedom ) , we find @xmath78 .",
    "we therefore require that the @xmath2 decouple from the thermal bath above the quark - hadron transition at 200400  mev , yielding 51 extra effective degrees of freedom from muons , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 quarks , and gluons .",

    "the tree - level couplings of @xmath52 , @xmath53 to @xmath98 and @xmath99 bosons , quarks , and charged leptons are suppressed by @xmath45 .",
