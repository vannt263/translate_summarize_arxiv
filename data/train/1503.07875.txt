    "when snia hubble diagrams revitalized @xmath3cdm , one could hardly guess how successful this cosmology would be in meeting cosmological data . in spite of its coincidence and fine tuning problems ,",
    "therefore , @xmath3cdm is surely the benchmark for any attempt to improve our understanding of cosmology .    in this series of works we present a detailed analysis of a new class of cosmologies that preserves all successes of @xmath3cdm models on large and intermediate scales . in turn , they improve the agreement with the observed dark matter distribution on small scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at the same time easing the coincidence and fine tuning problems of @xmath3cdm , while possibly launching a bridge between the reheating stages in the late inflationary regime and today s dark energy ( de ) nature .",
    "these cosmological models are based on the presence of three dark components : i ) a very  warm dark matter component ( wdm ) , uncoupled ( like the baryons ) , and constituting the observable dark matter at the present time ; ii ) a scalar field @xmath0 which acts as dark energy ; iii ) a peculiar cold dark matter component ( cdm ) , whose coupling to @xmath0 played an essential role in cosmic history , but whose density at @xmath5 naturally became almost negligible .",
    "we dubbed these models scdew ( strongly coupled de + wdm ) .",
    "the basic features of these models were discussed in two previous papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; bslv12 and bm14 respectively , hereafter ) . bslv12 dealt with background components : they showed that a purely kinetic scalar field @xmath0 strongly coupled to a cdm component would both exhibit densities @xmath6 ( @xmath7 scale factor ) , during the radiative eras , expanding along a tracker solution , with ( primeval ) density parameters @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "the derelativisation of a further wdm component eventually turns these components into quintessential de and a tiny cdm component .",
    "the radiative eras of these models are therefore characterized by three low density components , in top of the _ usual _",
    "@xmath10 s and @xmath11 s : wdm , coupled cdm and scalar field , accounting for constant fractions of the overall density , and sharing similar densities .",
    "bm14 then deals with fluctuation evolution , showing that cmb anisotropy and polarization spectra , in these models , are hardly distinguishable from the @xmath3cdm benchmark , while coupled cdm fluctuations continue to grow also between their entry in the horizon and matter  radiation equality , being so able , in spite of the low cdm density , to revitalize wdm fluctuations on scales suffering an early free streaming , even when the wdm particle mass @xmath12 is quite small .",
    "the @xmath0cdm coupling is therefore an essential feature in the early model evolution .",
    "after wdm has derelativized , instead , the @xmath0cdm coupling is unessential , while leading to technical difficulties , as @xmath13 ( cdm fluctuation amplitudes ) tend to approach unity , developing then some early non - linearities , typically involving @xmath14 of the total mass",
    ". however , switching off the @xmath0cdm coupling after the break of `` conformal invariance '' , yields more comfortably tractable models .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall formulate the lagrangian theory for strongly coupled dark energy cosmologies .",
    "it confirms the prediction on the coupled @xmath0cdm component densities , while outlining possible links with inflationary theories . in section 3",
    "we discuss the evolution of background parameters , focusing on the exit from the primeval stationary regime .",
    "we also widen the range of models in respect to bslv12 and bm14 papers , by allowing for @xmath15 fading after the exit from conformally invariant expansion . in section 4",
    "we discuss fluctuation evolution , taking also into account a possible @xmath16 fading .",
    "the effects of the early growth of cdm fluctuations are therefore analised , both as cause for the restart of wdm and baryon fluctuations , and for the possible formation of late cdm structures .",
    "we also show that , in order to mimic @xmath3cdm phenomenology through scdew models , the mass of wdm particles and the coupling are significantly constrained . in section 5",
    "fluctuation spectra are obtained and the model for n  body simulations of paper ii is conveniently selected .",
    "the last discussion section outlines the predictions of scdew models , namely for what concerns their discrimination from @xmath3cdm , whose main results are however faithfully reproduced .",
    "we also outline how scdew cosmologies , besides of easing low ",
    "scale @xmath3cdm conundrums , free us from its coincidence paradox and fine tunings .",
    "there are direct evidences that dark matter ( dm ) is a physical cosmic component , mostly clustering with observable baryons .",
    "doubts have been cast , on the contrary , on the true nature of dark energy ( de ) ; here we assume it to be a self  interacting scalar field @xmath0 , keeping essentially unclustered . in this scheme ,",
    "both dark components interact with baryons and radiations just gravitationally , so that the energy _ pseudo_conservation equation @xmath17 holds ( here @xmath18 are the stress  energy tensors of dm and de , their traces reading @xmath19 ) .",
    "this sum can vanish thanks to separate vanishings of both terms .",
    "the alternative option that @xmath20 however , is also widely considered in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , together with other possible options for energy transfer between dm and de ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling @xmath21 sets the intensity of the energy flow from dm to de .",
    "the option of scale dependent @xmath22 is also discussed in the literature , namely in connection with specific models ( see , e.g. , r.  mainini & s.a .",
    "bonometto 2004 ) .",
    "let the background metric then read @xmath23 ( @xmath24 conformal time , @xmath25 the spatial element ) ; eqs .",
    "( [ conti1 ] ) then yields @xmath26 @xmath27 being the dm density , while @xmath28 is a self  interaction potential , as is required within quintessential de models .",
    "the rational is to allow for an energy flow from ( cold)dm to de . in this way",
    ", the field density could keep a steady fraction ( some permils ) of cdm density during the whole cosmic expansion , in spite of @xmath0 being essentially kinetic above a suitable redshift @xmath29 . at @xmath30",
    "the de state parameter therefore shifts from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and such shift is found to be a generic feature , indipendently of the shape of @xmath28 . by keeping a significant field density at high @xmath4",
    ", this option eases one of the coincidence problems of @xmath3cdm .      within a field theory context",
    ", a possible assumption is that cdm is a non  relativistic dirac spinor field @xmath33 , interacting with @xmath0 through a yukawa  like lagrangian @xmath34 here 2 mass scales , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are introduced for dimensional reasons , @xmath37 being the planck mass . in particular , @xmath38 coincides with the coupling parameter in eq .",
    "( [ beta ] ) ( see below ) .    by assuming a kinetic part of the scalar field lagrangian @xmath39 its equation of motion reads @xmath40 once we work out that @xmath41 in the absence of a significant kinetic term for the spinor quanta .",
    "notice that the number density operator for the spinor field @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 according to the findings of @xcite .",

    "( [ eqmot ] ) reads @xmath50 , while the whole equation means that @xmath51 ( thence @xmath52 ) or , equivalently , @xmath53 by comparing this equation with the friedmann eq .",
    ", we deduce a constant early density parameter for cdm @xmath54 in turn , @xmath0 being purely kinetic , owing to eq .",
    "( [ dotf ] ) , its energy density @xmath55 coinciding with its pressure .",
    "the state parameter of the future quintessential field is then @xmath56 , while its _ early _ density parameter @xmath57 in connection with the scale dependence found for @xmath27 , let us outline that , if we read @xmath58@xmath59 as a mass term of the dirac spinor , its mass scales @xmath60 ( as though being _ redshifted _ ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "both @xmath0 and cdm energy densities scale as @xmath61 . in the absence of coupling",
    "they would scale as @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the flow of energy from cdm to @xmath0 is tuned to yield a faster ( slower ) cdm ( @xmath0 field ) dilution .",
    "the key issue , however , shown in bslv12 , is that these conditions are an attractor : even significantly perturbing `` initial conditions '' , the cosmic evolution rapidly settles on the behavior here described .",
    "accordingly , such kind of evolution could last since a very early epoch , even since the late inflationary stages .",
    "we might tentatively assume that cosmic reheating was due to the very @xmath0 field decaying into @xmath33 field quanta , a process stopping as soon as the attractor solution is attained .",
    "interactions of @xmath33 with other fields would then allow the @xmath0 field energy to reheat other cosmic components , including both @xmath10 s & @xmath11 s , as well as any other component then belonging to the _ thermal soup_.    the ensuing self  similar expansion , that can be defined _ conformally invariant _ ( in the sense discussed , e.g. , by parker 1969,1971 ) , can only be broken if a component scaling differently from @xmath61 achieves a significant density .",
    "if the attractor solution is followed since inflation , @xmath0 has had just a logarithmic time dependence since then .",
    "its today s value , therefore , is just @xmath64 times its value at the end of the reheating stages .",
    "in any reasonable cosmological model , baryon density would eventually break the conformally invariant expansion at a redshift @xmath65 . adding just a baryon component to radiative components ( coupled and uncoupled ) is however insufficient to meet observations . among viable possibilities",
    ", bm14 outlined the option of including a warm dm ( wdm ) component of thermal origin , with a temperature parameter @xmath66 .",
    "its derelativization occurs when @xmath67 ( mass of wdm quanta ) at a redshift @xmath68 . at @xmath69 , being @xmath70",
    ", it is @xmath71 and wdm is one of the components of the _ thermal soup _ ; then , at @xmath72 , being @xmath73 and therefore @xmath74 , wdm shall overcome the radiative component density so that the early stationary regime reaches an end .",
    "this also sets an end to the attractor solution of the coupled components . during their successive evolution , as in any model allowing for cdm  de coupling with small or large @xmath15",
    ", the state parameter of the field component must turn from + 1 to @xmath75 .",
    "this must occur _ about a suitable redshift @xmath30 _ so to allow a fair amount of today s de . in any approach based on a self interaction potential",
    "@xmath28 , the fair @xmath30 value is obtained by tuning some parameter(s ) inside @xmath28 expression itself .",
    "scdew models behave similarly .",
    "it is just convenient to make use of the first order field equation @xmath76 instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) ; here @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this equation , shown by bslv12 , requires @xmath79 to be assigned , instead of a potential @xmath28 . in this way , we select @xmath30 directly , without arguing about untestable @xmath28 expressions . more explicitly ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "in bm14 we also discussed the ( minimal ) dependence of results on the parameter @xmath82 ( @xmath83 here ) , whose arbitrariness replaces the choice of @xmath28 expression .",
    "an option , not mentioned by bslv12 and bm14 , is that @xmath15 gradually fades , after the rise of @xmath84 broke conformal invariance .",
    "no wanted feature of this class of cosmologies really depends on a late coupling and we shall see that , if @xmath15 fading occurs late enough , just minor quantitative changes arise .",
    "let us then consider the option that @xmath85 with @xmath86 . if we expect @xmath15 fading to be a sort of _ consequence _ of the loss of conformal invariance , if should be @xmath87 .",
    "accordingly , different options will be labelled by the value of the delay ( del . )",
    "@xmath88 which is an extra parameter we introduce here . in figure [ den ]",
    "we show the scale dependence of cosmic components in 4 different cases , passing from the option of ever lasting coupling , down to the case of delay @xmath89 . in this figure and anywhere in paper i , we select the following parameter values : @xmath90 here @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 are the present de and baryon density parameters , the present hubble parameter in units of 100 ( km / s)/mpc , the cmb temperature , the number of ( almost ) massless @xmath11 s , the primeval scalar fluctuation index , respectively . in the list , @xmath97 and @xmath98",

    "an earlier decoupling , instead , bears a number of consequences . among them , a rise of today s cdm density parameter @xmath105 , because the energy leaking from cdm to de has a stop . if keeping @xmath106 , this rise is limited and , in this range of @xmath107 values , the present cdm density parameter @xmath108 : the present cdm contribution to the cosmic budget is @xmath109 of baryons .",
    "a related effect is the formation of a dip in @xmath110 evolution . as a matter of fact ,",
    "until @xmath0 is purely kinetic , its density keeps @xmath111 , thanks to the energy inflow from cdm . in the radiative era , when @xmath112 , @xmath110 is then constant .",
    "the transition to matter dominance should strengthen @xmath113 decline ; however , when this occurs , coupled cdm density starts to increase , so providing a stronger @xmath0 feeding .",
    "if the feeding stops before the kinetic ",
    "potential transition , occurring at @xmath30 , a progressive dilution of @xmath113 is unavoidable .",
    "however , this produces a significant dip only if @xmath114 . owing to these reasons , in the rest of this paper i",
    "we shall never consider options @xmath115 .",
    "we shall also verify that models with any @xmath116 exhibit just minor differences .",
    "all through this discussion , we deliberately refrained from introducing any detailed physics causing a @xmath15 fading .",
    "possible mechanisms are discussed in appendix a and further options surely exist , but the introduction of a further parameter can hardly be avoided .",
    "the treatment given in this work keeps on the phenomenological side , just showing that @xmath15 fading can be self consistently introduced , so allowing a plain treatment of nonlinear stages .",
    "early nonlinear evolution will can be expected to induce a hierarchical rippled cdm distribution , made of `` virialized '' structures , on growing scales .    when and if @xmath15 fades , cdm turns into a component of fast heavy particles .",
    "we expect them to cause no substantial effect on the linear evolution of other components , also because of the smallness of the cdm density parameter ; on this ground we decided to not consider these effects in our linear treatment .",
    "before concluding this discussion on background evolution let us outline that the relation between expansion factor @xmath117 ( or redshift ) and ordinary time @xmath118 are almost identical in scdew and @xmath3cdm models ; discrepancies never exceed 0.01% for any values of coupling @xmath15 and delay @xmath107 .",
    "in bm14 fluctuation evolution is studied in detail . out of horizon _",
    "initial conditions _ are determined and the system of differential equations , holding after the entry into the horizon , is numerically solved . here",

    "( [ transition ] ) .",
    "all variables in this expression are known at each step of a linear evolutionary algorithm .",
    "it is then significant that , within this formulation , also in the fluctuation equations only @xmath133 and @xmath134 appear , while @xmath0 values never matter .",

    "figure [ evolve ] and [ evolve1 ] then show a few examples of linear evolution , for fluctuations in the different cosmic components , from before their entry in the horizon , down to @xmath5 .",
    "the background cosmic parameters are the same of figure [ den ] .",
    "the mass of the warm component is anywhere 90@xmath135ev , its range being fixed by the arguments discussed below , in the next subsection .",
    "the @xmath126 values selected for figure [ evolve ] , where the delay parameter is @xmath136 , correspond to the mass scales of @xmath137 ( or 8 , top panel ) , @xmath138 ( central panel ) , and @xmath139 ( lower panel ) .",
    "figure [ evolve1 ] is for 2 intermediate scales and @xmath140 . for the sake of comparison",
    ", the evolution of baryon and cdm fluctuations in a @xmath3cdm model with the same cosmological parameters is also overplotted .",
    "a first result is shown in the top figure [ evolve ] : the low@xmath4 growth of fluctuations , namely on ( scales close to ) the linear regime , is the same in @xmath3cdm and scdew cosmologies .",
    "numerical outputs confirm that discrepancies between @xmath3cdm and scdew growth factors , for @xmath141 , are below the expected precision of the algorithms used .",
    "it is so in spite of the ( slightly ) different final amplitudes . in the non  linear regime , discrepancies are appreciable , although still small .",
    "aside of that , it is worth outlining that scdew models are also indistinguishable from @xmath3cdm , as far as cmb spectra are concerned .",
    "discrepancies between scdew and @xmath3cdm cmb spectra , for @xmath142 are again below the expected precision of the algorithms used .",
    "another evident feature is the fast growth of _ coupled _ cdm fluctuations , not discontinued at the time when the horizon attains the fluctuation size . in @xmath3cdm ,",
    "_ uncoupled _ cdm fluctuation grow much more slowly , namely until radiation exceeds cdm density , as radiation fluctuations ( still coupled to baryons ) have stopped their growth , being in the sonic regime . in scdew models ,",
    "this extra growth is expected , in spite of the small density @xmath143 ( @xmath144 total density ) of the coupled cdm component : in the non  relativistic regime , coupling causes an increase of the _ effective _ cdm  cdm gravity by a factor @xmath145 @xcite ; * for @xmath146 , * this factor erases the division by @xmath147 so that , as far as self ",
    "gravity is concerned , it is as thought cdm had a density close to the total density @xmath148 .",
    "in addition , cdm particle velocities are enhanced by a continuous push due to their progressive mass decrease ( the so  called antidrag term ) .",
    "all these effects are taken into account by the linear program and cause an increase of cdm density fluctuations , after their entry in the horizon and in the radiation dominated epoch , approximately  @xmath149 .",
    "large amplitude cdm waves cause a restart of fluctuations in wdm , as soon as it becomes non  relativistic .",
    "as is also visible in figures [ evolve ] and [ evolve1 ] , wdm derelativizes at @xmath150 .",
    "derelativization is linked to the value taken by the @xmath151 ratio , between wdm and photon temperatures . if wdm particles decoupled from the _ thermal soup _ when its density was @xmath152 , today @xmath153 ( @xmath154 number of ( almost ) massless @xmath11 s in the cosmic background ; @xmath155 : number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of wdm decoupling ) , while @xmath156 for @xmath157 we have then @xmath158 so that @xmath159 if @xmath160 and @xmath161ev .",

    "thermal soup_.    at the time of wdm derelativization , cdm fluctuations @xmath13 exceed then any other fluctuations , by a scale dependent factor @xmath165@xmath166 for galactic scales .",
    "there is no boost to the cdm  wdm gravity due to coupling , but the cdm density excess @xmath167 is boosted by the factor @xmath168 , compensating the division by @xmath169 due to the small cdm density . as the factor @xmath168 depends on the time elapsed since the entry in the horizon , the restart of wdm fluctuations should be more and more effective towards greater @xmath126 values . in turn ,",
    "wdm particle escape velocity from smaller size fluctuations is smaller , so that the effect is only partially visible in the final spectra .    on the contrary , this very effect is unchallenged in baryons , whose mean velocities are negligible .",
    "also the ( later ) restart of their fluctuations is mostly due to cdm . in the absence of residual particle velocities ,",
    "baryon fluctuations growth even exceeds wdm fluctuations , both at high @xmath4 and at @xmath5 , namely at high @xmath126 .    since @xmath170 ,",
    "wdm density starts to dilute just @xmath171 , and primeval conformal invariance is broken . also baryon density growth violates such invariance , of course , but baryon density overcomes radiative components at a redshift @xmath172 . in principle , it can make sense that a break of conformal invariance and @xmath15 fading are related events : when wdm has turned non relativistic , the @xmath15 coupling appears like a residual pleonasm .",
    "leaving apart detailed options to model a relation between these effects , we just quantify it with the parameter defined in eq .",
    "( [ delay ] ) .",

    "wdm fluctuation regeneration in scdew models contrasts with undisputed free streaming effects in standard @xmath3wdm models , causing a large@xmath126 cutoff to the spectral function @xmath178 ( @xmath179 transfered spectrum ) , because of the erasing of any fluctuation entering the horizon before wdm has derelativized . with @xmath180ev ,",
    "the decline of @xmath181 starts at @xmath182mpc@xmath183 , @xmath181 being already damped by a factor @xmath184 at @xmath185mpc@xmath183 .",
    "accordingly , viable @xmath3wdm models currently refer to wdm masses @xmath1863  kev , allowing fluctuations to survive up to @xmath187@xmath188mpc@xmath183 .",
    "unfortunately , the need of such a large @xmath12 partially invalidates the choice of warm instead of cold dm .",
    "the residual motions of low  mass particles , e.g. , are then insufficient to reduce the number of expected mw satellites or to prevent them settling on a nfw ( navarro , frank & white 1997 ) profile .",

    "it is then significant that the linear theory of strongly coupled  de models exhibits a full restart of fluctuations .    before concluding that a solution to low ",

    "the former aim is fulfilled here below , the latter one is the target of paper ii .",
    "meanwhile , let us outline that there are a few other elements in favor of choosing @xmath180ev , indipendently of the expected halo and satellite predictions .",
    "the very figure  [ den ] shows that the contributions of wdm , cdm and @xmath0 to the primeval _ thermal soup _ are all within half order of magnitude .",
    "even though this is due to the choice of @xmath15 and @xmath12 , it would be reckless to conclude that it fixes their ranges , but it would also be hard to believe all that to be fully casual .",
    "-1.3truecm    figure [ denso ] then shows a strictly related point : the primeval density parameters @xmath193 plotted there are for cdm , @xmath0 and wdm .",
    "the wdm density parameter exhibits just quite a mild @xmath15 dependence .",
    "in fact , only for very low @xmath15 values , its level is significantly eaten by a non ",
    "negligible @xmath194 contribute .",
    "on the contrary , the wdm level would siginificantly depend on @xmath195 .",
    "should this mass be greater by @xmath196 , wdm derelativize earlier by @xmath197 and the wdm line should be lower . in order to recover the nearly  coincidence between primeval @xmath193 , fairly greater @xmath15 values should then be selected , as the dependence on @xmath16 is quadratic .",
    "the opposite would occur for lower @xmath12 values , with the risk to approach the limits of the physical range for  @xmath15 s .",
    "this plot should be however taken together with a third argument , which can be made only after giving details on spectra ( see figure [ sigbet ] , below ) : equal normalizations for cmb angular spectra and @xmath198 , in @xmath3cdm and scdew models , should be required ; this fixes a narrow @xmath15 range , once @xmath199ev is selected . in turn , figure [ denso ] returns @xmath199ev for that @xmath15 range .",
    "altogether , the two constraints are close to a system of 2 algebric equations with 2 unknown , although yielding softer constraints . @xmath200 and @xmath199ev are at the middle of the narrow allowed bands . if n",
    " body simulations will confirm that this selection favours observational profiles , etc .",
    ", we may say that this follows from the optimal parameter choice within the model .",
    "recovering ( wdm or ) baryon fluctuations thanks to coupled cdm action , on those scales where they had been erased , requires cdm fluctuations 1001000 times wider than uncoupled cdm fluctuations in @xmath3cdm models . in fact , coupled cdm has a much smaller density parameter than _ usual _ cdm , when its action is needed .",
    "luckily enough , such wide amplitude is an intrinsical feature of scdew models . in turn",
    ", this feature can cause the birth of early cdm nonlinearities .",

    "higher mass structures can also form up to a scale depending on the delay @xmath107 .    the most immediate problem related to cdm non  linearities concerns the reliability of linear algorithms predicting fluctuation evolution .",

    "accordingly , no excessive effects are expected on scales never overcoming a mild non  linearity .    at an advanced stage , evolved cdm non  linearities shall then be non  linear structures embedded in an almost unperturbed continuum , taking also into account that , altogether , the cdm density parameter has reduced to @xmath8@xmath210@xmath211 , so that the perturbing bodies shall be relatively rare .",
    "let us also outline that , also after @xmath15 fading , the linear algorithm will continue to treat cdm and baryons separately . as a consequence ,",
    "the cdm fluctuation @xmath13 can still overcome unity while the baryon fluctuation @xmath212 is still @xmath213 .",
    "however , in these conditions , cdm and baryon obey the same equations of motion and the physical variable is @xmath214 unless this is non  linear , physical non  linearities do not exist . also if , slightly before @xmath15 fading , @xmath13 approached unity , but without badly loosing coherence , the physical post  fading variable will be @xmath215 ; however , even if coherence is partially lost , that part of @xmath13 still coherent with @xmath212 will enter a unified growth regime .",
    "accordingly , the effect of marginal non linearities can be thought to be just a slight boost of the cdm+baryon fluctuation amplitudes .",
    "a quantitative estimate of such boost is not immediately feasible , although one must however recall that @xmath216 , so that the very uncertainty shall not be too large .",
    "when considering the spectral function in the next section , which are a product of linear algorithms , one must therefore discriminate among different possible _ meanings _ of apparently high @xmath217 for the cdm component at high @xmath126 .",

    "an alternative option is that only dm dynamics is modified , as occurs in `` ordinary '' coupled de theories .",

    "the very equation of state of de remains somehow arbitrary , although state parameters @xmath263 would require suitable extentions of the approach described in this work .",
    "all above experiments are therefore expected to yield results seemingly consistent with @xmath3cdm cosmologies .",
    "this point has been accurately verified in this work . in comparison with bslv12 and bm14 ,",
    "two further points were outlined here : ( i ) by providing a lagrangian approach to the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath33 fields ( de and cdm , respectively ) and stressing the logarithmic growth of the former one , we outlined the possibility that @xmath0 is both inflaton and de .",
    "( ii ) the risk of cdm fluctuations reaching an early non  linear dynamics was also outlined and _ circumscribed . _",
    "we shall further discuss the ( i ) point in another work .",
    "as far as the ( ii ) point is concerned , it is strictly linked to the _ minimal _ assumption of a constant interaction constant @xmath15 .",
    "we tentatively suggested to overcome such option by admitting @xmath15 to fade , once it accomplished its aim to allow us an ( almost ) conformally invariant cosmic expansion through cosmic ages .",
    "possible mechanisms directly relating conformal invariance break to @xmath15 fading , however , were not discussed .",
    "a number of alternative options are briefly discussed in appendix a.    altogether , the picture considered remains fully viable and leads to a phenomenological picture quite close to @xmath3cdm . in its theoretical framework , however , most of the unpleasant fine tunings and coincidences of @xmath3cdm are significantly eased .",
    "scdew and @xmath3cdm cosmologies are however distinguishable through a number of observables : first of all , scdew suggests a dm particle with mass @xmath264ev .",
    "if this kind of warm  hot dm replaces the cdm of @xmath3cdm models , in the absence of strong coupling there would be almost no structure in the universe .",
    "even the option of mixed cold and hot  warm dm is far from fitting data on dwarf rotation curves or large galaxy satellites . accordingly , _ discovering a sterile neutrino or a gravitino in the 100@xmath135ev mass range would mark a strong point in favour of scdew models . _",
    "the other critical prediction of scdew cosmologies is the formation of early coupled ",
    "cdm structures : coupled  cdm fluctuations @xmath13 , to be able to revive baryon and wdm fluctuations , had to be quite large when wdm particles finally became non ",
    "this is what theory predicts and is also the only way to make their density excess @xmath265 significant ; in fact @xmath266 or less .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 approaches unity earlier than other components . if , meanwhile , the cdm@xmath0 coupling fades , baryons and cdm share identical equations of motion and only their total fluctuation matters .",
    "non  linearity then becomes just a formal and harmless feature .",
    "should it be not so , bound cdm structures form .",
    "this however occurs over mass scales @xmath267 ( let us however recall that , altogether , coupled cdm density is @xmath268 of the very baryon density , today ) .",
    "this risks to weaken the predictivity of linear codes . when growing non linear , cdm fluctuation gravitation becomes stronger than linear codes compute , speeding up the growth of other components .",
    "this effect is however weakened by @xmath27 becoming even smaller than @xmath269 , as the universe turns from radiation to matter dominated , and by the fact that other component fluctuations have recovered such a significant amplitude to yield an at least comparable push .",
    "accordingly , we suggested the extra gravitational push of cdm to bear effects equivalent to shifting the parameter @xmath107 from 2 to 4 . although based on qualitative arguments , this option is not unlikely to approach the real effect .",
    "accordingly , n ",
    "body simulations in the accociated paper ii are based on the @xmath224 option .",
    "all that implies a clear prediction : that early cdm primeval structures have formed .",
    "although being extremely rare because of the low overall cdm density ( @xmath109 of baryon density ) , they could be the main existing structures at high redshifts ( @xmath270 ) and might have an effect at later times on the formation of the first stars and/or cosmic reionization ; we plan to address these issues in future work .    in our opinion , however ,",
    "the strongest argument in favour of scdew models is the apparent easing of fine tunings . in particular",
    ", a twofold dm is an option often considered on purely phenomenological bases .",
    "however , the _ true _ dm , in scdew cosmologies , is the warm one ; cdm is a sort of handyman component , fist allowing @xmath0 to keep on its tracker solution , then allowing inhomogeneities to revive on observational scales , eventually creating bound systems where it _ hides _ today .",
    "the real challenge of these models is finding out its hideouts .",
    "apart of that , replacing @xmath3 with a scalar field might seem not a fresh option . also the independence from i.c .",
    ", thanks to the presence of a field attractor , is not new .    in respect to standard quintessence theories , however , scdew models are favoured due to a few strong points :",
    "( i ) they are apparently independent from the choice of any specific potential for the @xmath0 field .",
    "( ii ) the quintessential @xmath0 field is shown to have necessarily been a significant cosmic component since long time , possibly since the end of inflation .",
    "( iii ) again , the attractor solution it fulfills is not linked to any potential choice .",
    "( iv ) the possibility that de and inflaton are the same field @xmath0 can also be pursued : in effect , since inflation , @xmath0 had just a logarithmic growth matching , e.g. , the logaritmic evolution of constants in a coleman  weinberg  like potential , so able to provide potential energy both then and now .",
    "the idea that @xmath3cdm is such a successfull model because it _ mimics _ an underlying more complex cosmology is not completely new .",
    "for instance , @xcite investigated cosmologies where de arises because of the increase of neutrino mass , aiming to a scenario substantially indistinguishable from @xmath3cdm .",
    "any such cosmology requires the introduction of extra parameters . in scdew models",
    "2 extra parameters ( apart of the delay @xmath107 ) are needed : the mass of the wdm particle and the coupling @xmath15 . however ,",
    "if we vary these parameters within a reasonable range , we obtain cosmologies which could also be _ mimiced _ by sorts of @xmath3cdm with a different choice of its basic parameters .",
    "moreover , the mass @xmath195 could soon become a non ",
    "free parameter , if a particle candidate is found . in this case , the costraints on @xmath15 , deriving from fluctuation amplitude , cmb spectrum , density parameter choice , etc .",

    ", we can assume @xmath275 ; an expression relating @xmath276 and @xmath277 to @xmath278 and @xmath279 is then obtainable , so to achieve similar results .    a smarter option ,",
