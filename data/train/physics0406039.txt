    "changing the propagation properties of light by designing a novel material is of interest both from a basic science point of view , and for technological applications .",
    "recent advances such as slowing down@xcite or stopping light@xcite , or left handed metamaterials @xcite promise advances in fields ranging from optics @xcite to quantum computation@xcite .",
    "it is desirable to find new materials in which electromagnetic waves exhibit novel behavior , and there is a flurry of activity both theoretically and experimentally in this direction .",
    "the macroscopic electromagnetic ( em ) properties of a medium are characterized by the frequency dependent dielectric constant@xcite @xmath0 and the magnetic permeability @xmath1    speed of an em wave of frequency @xmath2 in this medium is given by @xmath3 where c is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the index of refraction is then @xmath4    the dielectric constant of the medium shows large variations near a resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ when the frequency of the external field is near an internal state transition .",
    "this makes it easy to change the refractive index of a medium by properly tuning the frequency of the em wave to just above or below a transition .",
    "recently this fact was employed combined with quantum coherent effects to get very high refractive indices in atomic gases @xcite .",
    "although @xmath5 can change appreciably for a gas of atoms at optical frequencies , the magnetic permeability @xmath6 is always very close to its free space value",
    ". one can give arguments in classical electrodynamics to explain this @xcite , or understand it in terms of atomic transitions as follows .",
    "magnetic field component of an em wave couples to the atom much weaker than the electric field component .",
    "the magnetic coupling to an atom is proportional to the bohr magneton @xmath7 , while the electric coupling is @xmath8 .",
    "the fine structure constant @xmath9 also shows itself in the induced magnetic dipole moment .",
    "overall the effect of an em wave on magnetic permeability is @xmath10 weaker than its effect on the electric susceptibility .",
    "another important fact is that magnetic dipole transitions are allowed only between states which have the same radial wavefunction , and generally two such states are not separated by optical frequencies in energy .    now that it is hard to get @xmath6 to be different than one , we need to question why it is important to have another value for it .",
    "after all it seems from eq.([speedoflight ] ) that all the optical properties of the medium depend on the product @xmath11 the answer to this question is that the refractive index alone does not completely represent the medium @xcite .",
    "one can imagine two media , one with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "they would have the same refraction index , however , quite different optical properties .",
    "materials with both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are called left handed materials , named for parity of the coordinate frame formed by @xmath18 .",
    "optical properties of left handed and right handed materials differ mainly because , the poynting vector points opposite to @xmath19 in left handed materials .",
    "most remarkable change happens at the interface between a left handed material and a right handed material , where the usual snell s refraction law gets a sign change .",
    "in addition to the inverse snell s law , the reverse cerenkov radiation and the reverse doppler shift would also be possible in such materials@xcite .",
    "left handed artificial materials in the microwave region have recently been built@xcite by assembling a composite lattice of metallic split ring resonators and metallic wires@xcite , with periodicity much smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic field , or using anomalous propagation properties of light in a photonic crystal , with periodicity is in the order of the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation@xcite .",
    "all such systems ( called metamaterials ) , require delicate manufacturing of spatially periodic structures . in the microwave region ,",
    "improvements of focusing , filtering and steering properties of microwaves would be useful for many practical applications .",
    "similar improvements would also be valuable for applications operating at optical frequencies . in this paper",
    "we examine the case of an atomic gas without any spatial periodicity that could exhibit behavior similar to metamaterials at optical frequencies .",
    "we have remarked that the magnetic dipole response to an oscillating magnetic field is smaller by a factor of @xmath10 compared to the electric dipole response to an oscillating magnetic field . in an em wave @xmath20 and @xmath21 fields",
    "are always perpendicular to each other and are always in phase .",
    "if one can get the atom to respond to an electric field @xmath20 with a magnetic moment @xmath22 perpendicular to it , and in phase with it , one can effectively think that the magnetic dipole moment is induced by the magnetic field of the em wave .",
    "thus , it is possible get a magnetic response which is only @xmath23 times smaller than the electric response .",
    "such response enables one to achieve a regime where the propagation properties of light are significantly different .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the feasibility of this idea to modify the magnetic permeability of an atomic gas electromagnetically . to this end",
    ", we introduce a model system in the next section and find the necessary conditions for the applicability of our scheme . in section",
    "iii we present the results of our calculations for two different parameter regimes , a dilute gas and a dense gas .",
    "we then go on to discuss the consequences of our results for experiments .",
    "finally , we give a summary of our results and conclusions in section iv .",
    "in this section , we construct a model system for which the magnetic permeability can be optically modified .",
    "we also describe the scheme for modification in detail , and discuss its limitations .",
    "one can readily conclude by parity arguments that it is not possible to get a magnetic response to an electric field if only two states are involved .",
    "an electric field causes transitions to states which are of opposite parity to ground state , and such states do not have a magnetic dipole matrix element with the ground state . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we use a three level scheme , similar to the one used in electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite where an optically thick substance is made transparent and exhibits large dispersive response to the external field close to atomic resonance .",
    "the particular eit scheme here serves several useful features required for left - handedness , such as being dispersive and exhibiting resonance phenomena .",
    "eit materials do not suffer from linear absorption at resonance .",
    "they exhibit small transmission losses even at high densities . as a consequence of the resonance , the eit medium stores large amount of energy over the cycles of interaction , leading to strong material response . in order to have a negative electric and magnetic material response",
    ", we need both the macroscopic polarization and magnetization of the material become simultaneously so strong that they would be immune even the sign changes of the applied fields . for the weak probe beam",
    ", eit can not achieve this feat single - handedly . by considering a dense medium , with many particles within a cubic resonance wavelength , we let the local fields in the substance help to enhance the material responses .",
    "indeed , we see that , circularly polarized probe electric field , under eit conditions , together with the help of the lorentz - lorenz local field contribution , could maintain strong local currents that could give rise to large enough magnetization , insensitive to sign changes of the probe magnetic field . at the same time , the electric response also becomes negative .",
    "the remainder of the section presents the mathematics behind these ideas as well as the conditions of their applicability .",
    "we require the three states to have the following non - zero matrix elements : @xmath24 here @xmath22 is the magnetic dipole moment operator given by @xmath25 where the first two terms are the magnetic moments due to the electronic orbital angular momentum @xmath26 and spin angular momentum @xmath27 , while the last term is the contribution of nuclear spin angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the coefficients are @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( within a small @xmath31 correction found by quantum electrodynamical calculations ) .",
    "nucleon magneton is about 1800 times smaller than the bohr magneton .",
    "typical nuclear magnetic moments are about @xmath32 times smaller than their electronic counterparts and hence usually negligible .",
    "if the hamiltonian is parity invariant , we can choose all the states to be eigenstates of the parity operator @xmath33 . to satisfy the requirement ( [ matrixcondition ] )",
    "one should have @xmath34    we assume that the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 are coupled with an intense coherent beam while a weak probe beam will excite transitions between @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will investigate the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of a medium consisting of such atoms as a response to the probe beam .",

    "the interaction hamiltonian is written under the electric dipole approximation .",

    "it is useful to note here that these equations could be written more generally for a dense media in terms of the total local field . within the linear response theory , and assuming the material under consideration is linear , we will take into account lorentz - lorenz correction after determining the dilute material response as usual@xcite .",

    "carrying out standard linear response method , to the first order in the probe field amplitude , we replace the inversion @xmath58 by its initial value which is taken to be @xmath59 , assuming only a small fraction of atoms are pumped out of their initial states .",

    "we observe that this contributes to the complex permeability tensor of the system .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath71 and for small @xmath66 , we recover the well - known results for an electromagnetically induced transparent system .",
    "now , using the equation @xmath72 we deduce the relation @xmath73 for the new variable @xmath74 .",
    "we can now calculate the induced magnetic dipole moment of the atom using @xmath75 where @xmath76 is considered for the magnetic dipole operator by assuming the contribution from nuclear spin are negligible .",
    "the electronic spin part is for simplicity .",
    "as the lower levels are of opposite parity with the upper level , the only non - vanishing contribution may arise if the lower levels are of the same parity . in this case",

    "this is achieved when @xmath79 .",
    "setting aside the static field solution we consider the case of @xmath80 . the other possibility @xmath81 would be the case of a static electric field as the coupling field .",
    "this should be separately discussed as it is necessary to examine stark shifts of the levels and modify the present theory accordingly .",
    "the driving field is taken to be resonant with the @xmath82 when the probe is resonant with the @xmath83 so that @xmath84 which puts a constraint on the three level system as @xmath85 .",
    "this constraint is , however , a major obstacle in realizing the predicted effects here at a realistic experimental setting as it is not straightforward to find a system with two states , which have a matrix element of @xmath22 between them and at the same time have energy difference in the optical range .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that @xmath86 is an angular operator and the two states involved should have the same radial wavefunctions to give a non zero matrix element .",
    "one can imagine , some external magnetic field adjusting the separations to give the necessary energy conditions .",
    "however , for an atomic system to get splittings in the optical regime , the external field would be impractically large .",
    "one can try to investigate systems in which @xmath22 is not an angular operator , such as molecular gases , and try to find optically separated states which have a magnetic dipole matrix element between them .",
    "as far as atomic gases are concerned , the best option seems to be to take two states which have the same @xmath26 value but which are split due to l - s coupling to be the states @xmath87 and @xmath88 and try to get a third level of opposite parity to fulfill the energy condition .",
    "another direction to proceed would be to consider all our discussion for an atomic system under high electric field . in that case",
    ", it will not be too hard to get to fields which give shifts on the order of optical frequencies , however one must carefully do the preceding analysis again taking into account the effect of static electric field on all three states .",
    "we assume this condition is fulfilled with our hypothetical model atom and proceed by writing the product @xmath89 explicitly , so that we can examine the directional character of the magnetic response of the atom to the probe field .",
    "electric dipole of the probe transition and the magnetic dipole of the lower levels are combined through a tensor product relation such that @xmath90 where we introduce @xmath91 the tensor @xmath92 demonstrates the combined effect of electric and magnetic field components of the optical field on the directional character of the magnetic response of the medium .    to calculate the induced magnetic dipole moment matrix elements , it is convenient to consider angular momentum basis in which we can also calculate the elements of electric dipole moment using the wigner - eckart theorem",
    ". let us identify the states as @xmath93 and @xmath94 matrix elements of the angular momentum are readily obtained in this basis as @xmath95    the matrix elements of the electric dipole operator can be conveniently calculated by expressing it as a spherical tensor operator of rank @xmath96 so that its components become @xmath97 we use the wigner - eckart theorem in the form @xmath98 here , the first factor is the clebsh - gordan coefficient where we choose a notation resembling its symmetric form in terms of wigner-3j coefficients .",
    "the second factor is the reduced matrix element which is independent of the orientation of the magnetic dipole characterized by the angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath99 . in our case",
    "it is given by @xmath100 which is always non - vanishing , with @xmath101 being the radial wavefunction . by the @xmath99-selection rule",
    "( @xmath102 is required for non - vanishing matrix elements ) , we see that matrix elements of the @xmath103 vanish .",
    "the sole nonvanishing matrix element of @xmath104 determines the matrix elements of @xmath105 and @xmath106 components of the position operator which are found to be @xmath107 combining eq.[eq : mdipole ] and eq.[eq : edipole ] , we finally get @xmath108\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the matrix which determines the orientation of the induced dipole moment .",
    "it should be noted that the matrix @xmath92 gives zero response to positively polarized em waves in accordance with the dipole selection rules . for our particular set of levels , we need negatively polarized em waves as they provide the photons with correct helicity to satisfy the angular momentum conservation in the probe photon emission and absorption processes between the states 1 and 3 . for negatively polarized waves ,",
    "@xmath92 just reduces to a scalar .",
    "it is worth noticing that the structure of the tensor @xmath92 resembles that of gyrotropic substances with both @xmath109 and @xmath86 are tensors such as pure ferromagnetic metals and semiconductors .",
    "these were argued to be most likely candidates to demonstrate left - handedness in the original paper by veselago@xcite .",
    "further calculations require setting the polarizations of the coupling and the probe beams .",
    "to cause transitions between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; the coupling beam polarization @xmath110 has to have a component along the quantization direction @xmath111 .",
    "so let us take the coupling beam to propagate in the @xmath112 plane , and be linearly polarized along @xmath111 . to cause transitions between states @xmath37 and @xmath36 , the probe beam must have a polarization vector lying in the @xmath112 plane .",
    "let us take it to be propagating along the @xmath111 axis with polarization lying in the x - y plane .",
    "then , our general expression for the induced magnetic moment leads to @xmath113 where @xmath2 now denotes the frequency of the probe beam and @xmath114+\\mid \\omega_2 \\mid^2\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with this definition of @xmath115 we can extend our result to macroscopic electromagnetics of a gas with concentration n. in the spirit of clausius  mossoti equation @xcite , we define the magnetization per unit volume as @xmath116 now we recall the fourier transform of the curl equation for electric field in maxwell s equations . for a negatively polarized wave @xmath117 combining equations ( [ mequation]),([bequation ] )",
    ", we have @xmath118 finally by using the definitions @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we get @xmath121 with @xmath122 is the relative ( effective ) permeability .",
    "we shall see that combined effect of electric and magnetic field components of the optical fields , as well as local field effects lead to novel light propagation regimes in particular on the eit resonance frequency .",
    "we consider a gas of @xmath123na atoms with @xmath124 to examine the case of dense media where the lorentz - lorenz local field corrections play significant role and @xmath125 , for the case of a dilute gas where the local field effects are weak .",
    "our results are presented in fig.[fig2 ] for the dense media and in fig.[fig3 ] for the dilute gas .     and",
    "the relative magnetic permeability @xmath126 of the dense gas of three level atoms with @xmath124 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131.,width=312 ]    we see that both the relative dielectric permittivity @xmath132 and the relative magnetic permeability @xmath133 can become negative over a band of frequency @xmath134 .",
    "this allows the propagation of light through otherwise opaque medium at high densities where the electromagnetically induced transparency would not work . at resonance",
    "we find @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "it is natural to have transmission losses in our model , similar to other left - handed structures , as they are unavoidable due to the kramers - kronig relations ensuring the causality in the system . on the other hand , theoretically it is not a trivial task to estimate the amount of losses@xcite and to rigorously prove the causality in left - handed materials@xcite",
    ". we can give a simple and rough estimate by simply taking into account the imaginary part of the refractive index which gives that after several microns the optical field will be damped by @xmath137 due to linear absorption .",
    "at such length scales , our atomic system with the given densities may be found in bose - einstein condensed state due to the interatomic interactions .",
    "multiple scattering of photons as well as higher order many body correlations may contribute in addition to the local field correction .",
    "such effects are argued to be about the same order with the local field correction @xcite .",
    "it is an intriguing possibility that the present result of induced left - handedness could improve and benefit from contributions arising from the quantum correlations in a dense bose - einstein condensate or in a dense degenerate fermi gas . in this paper , we will be content with limiting ourselves to classical gaseous media and hope to discuss the case of quantum gases elsewhere in detail .",
    "but for the case of dilute gas with @xmath125 . here , the electric susceptibility and the magnetic susceptibility are plotted as the relative permittivity and the permeability do not change appreciably from unity.,width=312 ]    in the dilute gas limit , we recover the usual behavior of the electric susceptibility under electromagnetically induced transparency conditions .",
    "the transparency region is in the valley between the twin peaks in the imaginary part of the electric susceptibility where the peaks correspond to the two dressed absorption lines , the autler - townes doublet@xcite .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility exhibits steep variation over a narrow band of frequencies in the vicinity of the resonance while in magnitude the relative permeability remains close to unity for all @xmath138 . when @xmath139 , similar results to those shown in fig.[fig3 ] are found where now @xmath140 varies between @xmath141 and @xmath142 over @xmath143 .    in our numerical calculations",
    ", we estimate the dipole matrix element from the spontaneous emission rate @xmath128 using the relation @xmath144 . here",

    "in summary , we suggested a method for optical modification of magnetic permeability using a three level scheme and derived the necessary conditions for its applicability .",
    "we found that it is in principle possible to electromagnetically induce left - handedness to a spatially homogeneous media .",
    "the major challenge we face is to have two levels separated at optical frequencies while having a non - vanishing magnetic dipole matrix element .",
    "such level splittings require large external magnetic fields or should be engineered by other means such as external electric fields or spin - orbital couplings .",
    "one may also consider molecular gases , or try to utilize excitonic energy levels in solid state heterostructures to engineer three level system fulfilling the energy condition .",
    "the predicted effect is fundamentally based upon the lorentz - lorenz local field contribution in an electromagnetically induced transparency medium of three level atoms with a non - vanishing dipole moment between lower levels . in dense medium limit ,",
    "in which the medium becomes opaque normally with a negative dielectric constant , the presence of magnetic dipole gives rise to a negative magnetic permeability so that the probe beam would still propagate within the otherwise optically thick dense medium for several microns before it is finally absorbed .",
    "it should be emphasized that the presented method is applicable to spatially homogeneous media and does not need any spatial periodicity which is unavoidable in metamaterials . in the dilute medium limit , the value of permeability do not change from unity appreciably , however , in this case we observed that it demonstrates steep changes over a small band of frequency .",
