    "the dynamics and rheology of immiscible fluid mixtures ( emulsions ) are vital in many practical applications such as pharmaceutics , cosmetic and the food industry . while they are macroscopically phase separated at rest , droplets of various sizes and shapes are created under flow field , which deform , rupture and reconnect in a steady state .",
    "the rheological property of such a system is intimately related to the statistics of domain structures , i.e. , the spatial profile of the interfaces  @xcite .",
    "this can be quantified by the interface tensor @xmath0 and the interfacial area density @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the unit vector normal to the interface and the integral is over the whole interface in the system volume @xmath3 .",
    "note the summation convention for the repeated indices is implicit throughout the paper , that is , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . from the analysis of the time evolution of these quantities , doi and ohta proposed a constitutive equation for binary fluid mixtures having the same viscosity and density , mixed with the volume ratio of about 1 : 1  @xcite .    throughout the present paper",
    ", we shall assume the above condition to hold , but as a new element , allow the two fluids to have a mismatch in their dielectric constants , which are denoted as @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "then , the system acquires an ability to respond to an electric field , leading to the shape change of droplets and interfacial instabilities  @xcite .",
    "this change in the domain structure is expected to affect the flow properties of the system , thus giving rise to the electro - rheological effect  @xcite . despite its fundamental and practical importance",
    ", the theoretical study on this subject has been limited so far .",
    "na _ et al _ have carried out theoretical analysis of electro - rheology based on maffettone - minale model for a single droplet  @xcite , and orihara _ et al _ have analyzed their data by using the interface tensor for an ellipsoidal droplet  @xcite .",
    "but the constitutive equation describing this type of electro - rheology is not available yet .",
    "it is noted that , here , in addition to the viscous stress @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the macroscopic velocity gradient and @xmath10 is the viscosity of the fluids , there are two contributions to the stress tensor : the first arises from the interface @xmath11 which is expressed via the interface tensor with interfacial tension @xmath12 as a proportionality factor .",
    "the second is the maxwell stress @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the local dielectric constant and the electric field at the spatial position @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "since the maxwell stress is created at the boundary with dielectric gap , its spatial average @xmath17 is expected to be correlated with the interfacial configuration .",
    "indeed , it has been shown  @xcite that under the weak electric field and the small dielectric mismatch @xmath18 , the average maxwell stress is expressed as @xmath19 with the coupling tensor @xmath20 which is a function of the typical length scale @xmath21 of the domain . here the external electric field @xmath22 ( defined as the voltage difference across the capacitor divided by its gap width ) is constant in space and @xmath23 . in what follows",
    ", we will omit the argument in @xmath24 when @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the typical domain size under steady flow with the shear rate @xmath27 ; otherwise ( @xmath28 ) , we make the argument explicit .",
    "note that @xmath29 is not a parameter given externally , but emerges as a result of the dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the electro - rheology of the immiscible fluid mixture under the situation , where the relative magnitude of the electric field is weak compared to the flow field .",
    "more concretely , the condition of the weak electric field can be stated that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the trace of the tensor @xmath32 .",
    "physically , the quantity @xmath33 measures the ratio of the electrostatic energy to the interfacial energy at the length scale @xmath21 .",
    "our procedure composes of two steps .",
    "first , by adding the term arising from the electric field effect into the original doi - ohta theory , we derive the time evolution equation of the interface tensor under the simultaneous action of the flow and electric fields .",
    "second , we need to take account of the maxwell stress contribution to the stress tensor , which can also be expressed in terms of the interface tensor through eq .",

    "iii , we apply the derived equations to examine the steady state rheology , where the constant electric field is imposed on top of the constant flow field .",

    "al , in which the dynamical stress response to the oscillatory electric field has been measured  @xcite . summary and future challenges are given in sec . v.",
    "under flow field , but in the absence of the electric field , the stress tensor for the mixture of two fluids with the same viscosity @xmath10 can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the pressure . the second term on the right hand side is the interface contribution , where the interface tensor ( cf .",

    "we adopt this traceless form as the definition of these interfacial and coupling tensors to facilitate the symmetry argument .",
    "it is noted here that the flow field and the interfacial tension are two main factors affecting the interface tensor . the former enlarges and orients the interface , and the latter counteracts it , hence providing the physical mechanism for the relaxation . by accounting these factors separately , and summing them up , doi and ohta proposed the following time evolution equations for the interface tensor and interfacial area density  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 with positive numbers @xmath44 and @xmath45 which may depend on the volume fraction .",
