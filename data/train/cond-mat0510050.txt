    "a quantum degree of freedom of an electron localized in a quantum dot ( qd ) , i.e. its spin , is thought to be a useful tool for the realization of nanoscale devices that can be used for information processing.@xcite the interaction of spins with the environment on the one hand allows necessary _ read and write _ procedures on the other hand , leads to losses of the information held by the system .",
    "thus , a critical issue regarding the possibility to convert quantum dots into a hardware realization of quantum information devices is the the ability to manipulate quickly the spins of electrons localized in quantum dots and to keep them in the desired states as long as necessary .",
    "the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling in qds plays a crucial role both for the spin manipulation and lifetime of the prepared spin states . for example , the so coupling allows the effective manipulation of spins by an external electric field due to the fact that the electric field influences the orbital degrees of freedom , and , through the so coupling , the spin states .",
    "the most interesting example of such a manipulation is the electric dipole spin resonance @xcite , the effect that occurs when the electric field of the incident electromagnetic wave causes spin - flip transitions resonating with the wave frequency . in this case",
    "the electric field is a much more efficient tool for manipulating the spins than the magnetic field .",
    "the spin states in quantum dots can be prepared and controlled by an external optical field @xcite too , thus allowing an optical realization of the @xmath0and @xmath1 operations for applications in information technologies .",
    "the so coupling in two - dimensional systems based on ( 001)-type structures is described by the sum of the rashba @xcite @xmath2 and dresselhaus - originated@xcite @xmath3 terms , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the coupling constants , @xmath6 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath7 is the in - plane momentum of electron . here",
    "@xmath8 is the electron charge , and @xmath9 is the vector - potential of the external field . @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms arise due to the artificial macroscopic asymmetry of the structures and due to the microscopic inversion asymmetry of the unit cells , respectively . for holes",
    "the so hamiltonian is more sophisticated leading to a more complicated spectra of spin excitations and spin dynamics @xcite .    in gaas",
    "/ al@xmath12ga@xmath13as structures @xcite and si - based transistors@xcite , the so coupling constants typically range from 10@xmath14 to 10@xmath15 ev@xmath16 cm .",
    "it is important to mention that by applying an external bias across the quantum well , it is possible to manipulate the magnitude of @xmath17 in ingaas / inalas - based @xcite and gaas / alas - based @xcite systems and even change its sign by doping @xcite . in the asymmetric si / si@xmath13ge@xmath12 quantum wells investigated in refs.@xcite , where the dresselhaus term is absent due to the unit cell inversion symmetry and the the band gap is relatively large , the doping - induced so coupling is three orders of magnitude weaker than in zincblende systems @xcite .",
    "the so coupling not only provides an ability to manipulate spins with an electric field , and thus , hopefully , to design a spin transistor @xcite , but also leads to spin relaxation .",
    "the dyakonov - perel mechanism@xcite , which requires random scattering of electrons by impurities and/or phonons , describes the spin relaxation of non - confined electrons in the bulk and in two - dimensional ( 2d ) structures where the electron momentum @xmath18 is a relatively well defined quantum number . here the orientation of the spin precession axis in the so field @xmath19 changes randomly through scattering events .",
    "the spin ( @xmath20 ) and momentum relaxation rates are inversely proportional to each other in this case .",
    "the resulting spin relaxation rate is @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the momentum relaxation time , and @xmath23 depends on @xmath5 and @xmath24 .",
    "the spin relaxation can also arise from the random paths of electrons in regular systems of antidots @xcite and the tunneling of holes in arrays of si / ge qds @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms of so coupling and spin relaxation were reviewed recently in ref ..    for this reason it is necessary to understand the limits to the abilities to manipulate the electron spins in qds , where , due to the localization , the electron momentum is not a good quantum number , and thus the spin dynamics @xcite , and hence the spin relaxation require a more sophisticated consideration .",
    "a possible `` admixing '' mechanism of spin relaxation in qds arises since so coupling mixes the electron states with opposite spins , and , therefore , can cause spin - flip transitions by the emission a phonon @xcite .",
    "this effect is a manifestation of an effective spin - phonon coupling caused by the so interaction .",
    "it has been shown , however , that other mechanisms can be important for the spin relaxation .",
    "for example , the interaction of the electron spin with the spins of nuclei in gaas qds can lead to spin relaxation even if no so coupling in the rashba or dresselhaus form is present @xcite .",
    "this interaction limits the maximal spin relaxation time . in si - based qds",
    "the spin relaxation can arise due to the modulation of the electron @xmath25factor by phonons @xcite . however , theoretically considered @xcite and recently observed @xcite rashba- and dresselhaus - type so coupling in 2d si systems can lead to a more conventional  admixing  mechanism of the spin relaxation there .",
    "we note here that the randomness in so coupling leads to a gaussian rather than to an exponential decay of the spin polarization @xcite as well as to a serious limitation of the operational modes of the proposed spin transistor devices @xcite .",
    "thus , the possibility to manipulate the spin states depends on the so coupling strength , which , therefore , plays both a positive and negative role in the spin dynamics of qds . a solution to this dilemma can be found in the ability to change the strength of the so coupling by switching it on and off when the desired spin states are produced and preserved , respectively .",
    "for example , the effects of the structural asymmetry of a quantum well can be strongly reduced @xcite and/or the rashba and the dresselhaus terms can be effectively compensated by applying an external bias @xcite .",
    "if realized experimentally , the suggestion of ref.@xcite , is expected to open a route for a larger ( up to 100 @xmath26 m ) size spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite    here we concentrate on the effect of random so coupling on spin relaxation in qds arising in systems where the artificial asymmetry and , in turn , the rashba - type so coupling is produced by one - sided doping .",
    "the randomness of the so coupling in our model arises due to fluctuations in the dopant concentration . because of the randomness , the so coupling can not be completely compensated by applying an external bias since the bias is uniform as a function of the in - plane coordinate .",
    "we show that even when the bias removes the regular part of the so coupling , the spin relaxation rate is still finite due to the residual random so coupling .",
    "this effect limits a possible decrease of the spin relaxation rate to two orders of magnitude at most . as another example of the role of inhomogeneous so coupling in qds we note its influence on the localization effects @xcite and on spin dynamics of electrons in quantum rings interacting with the surrounding nuclei @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents a model of the random so coupling in two - dimensional structures and provides us with the basis for the calculations for qds . in the third section we present a theory of spin relaxation in qds with random so coupling , emphasizing ingaas - like structures .",
    "a summary of the results and a discussion of possible extensions of this work is given in the conclusions .",
    "in 2d systems where so coupling arises due to one - sided doping , the @xmath24 parameter can not be considered as a constant in space since fluctuations of the concentration of the dopant cause its randomness . for doped si and ge bulk crystals",
    "the importance of randomness of the so coupling was first understood by melnikov and rashba @xcite .",
    "below we consider the dopant fluctuations - induced rashba field in lateral qds , calculate the corresponding spin relaxation rate , and show that for applications the randomness imposes important restrictions on the minimum spin - flip rate .    a structure consisting of a 2d channel where the qds are formed and a narrow dopant layer with a 2d concentration @xmath27 of dopants with charge @xmath28 is considered , with @xmath29 being the 2d in - plane radius - vector . as the factor that determines the local strength of the so coupling",

    "the fluctuations are taken to obey gaussian statistics , as is commonly considered in the theory of doped semiconductors @xcite . with the increase of the distance between the layers ,",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath45 become smaller and smoother .",

    "the physics behind these two relaxation processes in systems of qds coupled to phonons is similar @xcite .",
    "therefore , the randomness of the so coupling considered above also influences the dephasing time @xmath206 .",
    "this is an interesting problem which will be investigated separately .",
