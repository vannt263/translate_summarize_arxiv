    "we exploit this relationship to significantly strengthen previous uniqueness results concerning equation  ( [ + ddereal ] ) .",
    "our main uniqueness result is that  ( [ + ddereal ] ) has a unique solution ( up to a multiplicative constant ) in the class of exponentially bounded functions .    to exploit the relationship between the two equations  ( [ + ddereal ] ) and  ( [ -ddereal ] ) , we need to amass a certain amount of information concerning a solution to the latter . in this direction",

    "the particular properties of the parameters in this case are exploited to show that any solution to the underlying equation which is not polynomially bounded must be very wild indeed .",

    "we now know of at least four types of number theoretical problems in which difference differential equations arise .",
    "these may be loosely classified according to the context of the original problem .",
    "the first type , `` psixyology ''  @xcite encompasses those problems associated with determining the probability distribution of the prime factors of an integer  @xcite .",
    "the second type , `` sieve theory ''  @xcite is concerned with the problem of estimating the size of a finite set of integers after certain residue classes have been eliminated  @xcite .",
    "the third type deals with the problems relating to the determination of the cycle decomposition of a random permutation  @xcite , and is closely related to the first  @xcite .",
    "the fourth type focuses on estimating incomplete sums of multiplicative functions  @xcite .    despite the extensive literature on the subject ,",
    "apart from the treatment of a few isolated cases  @xcite the main focus has been on the application to problems in number theory and combinatorics as opposed to the study of the underlying difference differential equations as a problem in its own right .",
    "although a systematic study of equation  ( [ + ddereal ] ) in full generality was initiated in  @xcite , there is still additional work that remains to be done with regard to providing a comprehensive treatment .",
    "the present paper can be viewed as a further contribution in this respect , in that we explore more deeply the question of uniqueness , and reveal more fully the role of the adjoint equation  ( [ -ddereal ] ) .",
    "it is hoped that some of the analytical techniques used herein  and more generally our ongoing program of study  will be of interest to researchers in number theory and the wider differential equations community as well .",
    "as in  @xcite , we fix a non - negative integer @xmath22 , real numbers @xmath23 , complex numbers @xmath24 , and put @xmath25 . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",

    "the main interest in @xmath28 stems from the fact that it provides a @xmath42 solution to the difference differential equation  ( [ + ddereal ] ) .",
    "more specifically , combining proposition  2.2 and corollary  2.4 of  @xcite yields the following result .",

    "the proof in  @xcite of this latter result is unnecessarily complicated , applying residue theory to the inverse laplace transform of a suitably high order derivative of a supposed solution . before proceeding further , it may be of interest to give a simpler proof which has the additional advantage of requiring only that the supposed solution be majorized by a polynomial on the positive real half - line .",
