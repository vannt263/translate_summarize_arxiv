    "assuming self - similarity near a rupture point ( @xmath56 ) , the film thickness may be expressed as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the similarity variable given by @xmath59 substituting ( [ eq : similarity_ansatz ] ) in ( [ eq : pde ] ) , we find that @xmath60 satisfies the ordinary differential equation @xmath61 ' , \\label{eq : sim}\\ ] ] where the similarity exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 are determined uniquely by matching the powers of @xmath64 premultiplying each of the viscous , capillary and disjoining pressure terms : @xmath65    the fourth - order similarity equation ( [ eq : sim ] ) must be closed by four boundary conditions .",

    "thus , @xmath72 for general @xmath3 , @xmath73 is not an exact solution of equation ( [ eq : sim ] ) ( this , however , is the case for @xmath0 , for which @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) .",

    "in fact , the condition @xmath84 effectively imposes two boundary conditions on ( [ eq : sim ] ) .",
    "this may be deduced by analysing the ` stability ' of @xmath85 as @xmath71 using the wkb ansatz @xmath86 linearising ( [ eq : sim ] ) for small @xmath87 results in @xmath88 ' = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that only the leading - order behaviour in @xmath58 is required to determine the exponent @xmath89 .",
    "assuming @xmath90 , which will be confirmed _ a posteriori _ , the dominant balance in ( [ eq : fflinear ] ) is between the second term and the highest - order derivative in the expansion of the third term , that is , @xmath91 substituting the assumed forms for @xmath92 ( again , only the leading - order term @xmath93 is required ) and @xmath94 and keeping the highest - order terms in @xmath58 results in @xmath95 finally , matching the exponents gives the value for the power @xmath96 of the function in the exponent , while matching the coefficients gives a quartic equation for the eigenvalue  @xmath89 : @xmath97 here we have used ( [ eq : alphabeta ] ) to express @xmath62 and @xmath63 in terms of @xmath3 .",

    "in addition , @xmath96 is positive for any @xmath98 and thus there are two values of @xmath89 with positive real parts ( the zero eigenvalue allows for perturbations in the parameter  @xmath83 ) .",
    "the constants on the eigenfunctions @xmath94 corresponding to these values must be zero to achieve ( [ eq : ff ] ) , thus two constraints are imposed on the problem by this far - field condition . when @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 , which was derived previously@xcite",
    ".    there are some critical values of @xmath3 to take note of .",
    "care must be taken in applying the far - field boundary conditions when @xmath101 , as the quasi - stationarity condition only implies ( [ eq : ff ] ) when @xmath102 . in our computations of self - similar solutions",
    ", we will not observe solution branches that extend below @xmath44 , so this potential issue is not of concern .",
    "in addition , when @xmath103 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are negative , and the similarity ansatz  ( [ eq : similarity_ansatz ] ) does not represent rupture . at @xmath104 ,",
    "the similarity exponents @xmath62 and @xmath63 in ( [ eq : alphabeta ] ) are undefined",
    ". at this critical value , the scaling no longer behaves as a power law , and instead of ( [ eq : similarity_ansatz ] ) the appropriate ansatz to make is @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath62 is undetermined from the scaling ( it is possible in this case that @xmath62 is determined as a second - kind similarity solution  @xcite , given an appropriate quasi - stationary far - field condition , but we do not pursue this issue further in the current study ) .",
    "following @xcite , we enforce the far - field condition ( [ eq : ff ] ) approximately by applying two mixed conditions that are satisfied by ( [ eq : ff ] ) at @xmath107 , the simplest of which are @xmath108 the task is now to compute solutions to ( [ eq : sim ] ) , for a given @xmath3 , that satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ eq : simbc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : simbc2 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this will be achieved using numerical continuation .",
    "the general aim of numerical continuation is to compute a solution to a nonlinear , algebraic system of equations ( including discretisations of differential equations ) , which feature one or more parameters .",
    "the dependence of the solution on a given parameter , that is , the solution branch , is traced out numerically using a predictor  corrector method : given one point on the branch ( for a given parameter value ) , a small step is taken along the branch , varying both the parameter and the solution , to a new point on the branch . as this step can only be taken approximately , this predictor is then used as the initial guess in a correction algorithm , usually a variation of newton s iteration .",
    "this process may be repeated to compute the branch over a longer interval .",
    "it is advantageous to parameterise the solution branch by its arclength ( or at least a local approximation ) , rather than the system parameter , in order to easily handle turning points in the solution branch . in this case , the method in known as pseudo - arclength continuation@xcite .",
    "the parameters used in a continuation procedure may be model parameters or artificial parameters introduced for expediency , and we will make use of both in the following .",
    "the computations are done with software auto07p@xcite , which utilises the pseudo - arclength continuation method and has been developed primarily for continuation and bifurcation detection in boundary - value problems .",
    "first , we convert ( [ eq : sim ] ) to a system of first - order equations by introducing the state variables @xmath109 the state variables satisfy the system [ eq : simodes ] @xmath110 note that @xmath111 has been introduced so that the system is autonomous .    as a starting solution",
    ", we note that when @xmath0 , ( [ eq : sim ] ) has the exact solution @xmath112 satisfying the far - field conditions ( [ eq : simbc2 ] ) , but not conditions ( [ eq : simbc1 ] ) at @xmath113 .",
    "equivalently , we have an exact solution @xmath114 that satisfies ( [ eq : simodes]a  e ) and far - field conditions ( [ eq : simbcsu ] ) , but not the equivalent of the left - hand boundary conditions ( [ eq : simbc1 ] ) , namely @xmath115 at @xmath113 .",
    "we thus introduce artificial parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 into the left - hand boundary conditions , as well as an approximate left - hand boundary location @xmath118 to handle the coordinate singularity at @xmath113 , and enforce the conditions @xmath119 the far - field boundary conditions ( [ eq : simbc2 ] ) are also enforced at the large but finite value @xmath120 .",
    "given appropriate values of @xmath121 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , namely , @xmath122 @xmath114 satisfies ( [ eq : simbc3 ] ) , so may be used as a starting point for our computation . using numerical continuation , we now take @xmath117 and @xmath116 to zero for positive @xmath123 , allowing @xmath121 to be free in each case . now ,",
    "as @xmath123 is taken to zero , we approach a solution to the original problem ( [ eq : sim ] ) satisfying the correct boundary conditions ( [ eq : simbc1 ] ) .",
    "the introduction of the artificial parameters also provides a systematic way of computing the other members of the discrete family of solutions . for @xmath124 and @xmath125",

    "this figure is qualitatively similar to the corresponding figure for the plane - symmetric case@xcite .    as the magnitude of oscillations of @xmath117 decreases , the selection of discrete solutions becomes more difficult to resolve .",

    "the most interesting phenomenon to note is the merging of pairs of branches at a value @xmath68 as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "the branch with the largest value of @xmath121 merges with the second branch at the critical value @xmath147 . at @xmath0 ,",
    "this branch is the only stable one @xcite , and it is reasonable to assume these stability properties carry over to other values of @xmath3 .",

    "subsequent pairs of solution branches also merge at turning points , as depicted in figure [ fig : branches]a . while these turning points are less than @xmath149 , these solution branches are expected to be unstable .",
    "since we compute eight solution branches in total , we have found four turning points ( including the first point at @xmath149 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the numerical problem for higher branches makes computation of further points highly difficult , so we do not attempt to estimate the asymptotic behaviour of the turning points ( particularly given the unreliability of seemingly accurate power - law fits as discussed below in section [ subsec : asymptotics ] ) .",
    "however , this is an interesting question that could possibly be answered using asymptotic techniques , as discussed further in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the non - existence of a stable similarity solution for @xmath148 raises the issue of the dynamical behaviour of the time - dependent problem ( [ eq : pde ] ) in this regime .",

    ", we also compute the asymptotic behaviour of solutions for large branch number @xmath136 . in the literature , it is standard to characterise the solutions by the coefficient @xmath134 in the far - field condition ( [ eq : ff ] ) ; we compute the dependence of both @xmath121 and @xmath134 on @xmath136 . both @xmath121 and @xmath83",

    "of particular note is the fact that the exponents for @xmath121 are roughy equal to @xmath151 , while the exponent @xmath152 for @xmath134 when @xmath0 is equal to the previously derived value @xcite .",
    "however , while the numerically computed results are seemingly well - fit by a power law , the true asymptotic behaviour of these solution coefficients is likely to be more subtle , as indicated by the recent study by chapman et al .",
    "these authors performed the asymptotic analysis of the plane - symmetric version of ( [ eq : sim ] ) for @xmath0 , using the techniques of exponential asymptotics .",
    "the main result is that the apparent power law behaviour does not hold in the @xmath150 limit ; instead , they find that the correct asymptotic behaviour is actually @xmath153 for positive constants @xmath154 and @xmath155 ; these constants depend on the leading - order ( ) solution , which can only be solved numerically .",
    "a similar formula to ( [ eq : asymp ] ) is likely to be true for axisymmetric rupture and general exponent @xmath3 , so the numerically fitted power laws in figure [ fig : branches ] can not be taken to be representative of the true large-@xmath136 behaviour .      given the existence of branch - merging for axisymmetric thin films , it is worth checking to see whether the same phenomenon occurs in the plane - symmetric version of the same problem .",
    "if the axisymmetric film ruptures in a self - similar way at a point away from the origin ( corresponding to ring rupture ) , then the local behaviour is identical to plane - symmetric rupture @xcite , so the existence of stable plane - symmetric solutions is therefore also of relevance to the fate of the time - dependent , axisymmetric film governed by ( [ eq : pde ] ) .    in a plane - symmetric geometry ,",
    "the equation for the similarity solution @xmath60 is , @xmath156 where now @xmath157 , with @xmath158 denoting the cartesian coordinate .",
    "appropriate boundary conditions are ( [ eq : simbc1 ] ) at the origin , which are now interpreted as symmetry conditions , and the same stationarity conditions ( [ eq : simbc2 ] ) as for the axisymmetric problem .",
    "the major difference in the plane - symmetric case is that , since the square root function @xmath159 is no longer an exact solution , we must choose a different starting point .",
    "for this reason , we directly extend the solutions generated by @xcite for @xmath0 , where the starting point for continuation was obtained by homotopy continuation from the marginal stability problem of a near - flat film , to the similarity equation ( [ eq : planesim ] ) .",
    "another difference is that the boundary conditions may be imposed at @xmath113 without encountering a coordinate singularity . otherwise , the process of computing solution branches over @xmath3 is the same as carried out above for the axisymmetric problem .",
    "the solution branches thus computed are plotted in figure [ fig : planesim ] .",
    "it is clear that the different geometry has only a minor effect on the branches , and branch pairs still merge as @xmath3 decreases .",
    "in fact , the first turning point , which we denote by @xmath160 , is equal to @xmath161 within numerical error , which is slightly larger than the corresponding value @xmath162 in the axisymmetric case .",
    "thus , when @xmath163 , there are no stable similarity solutions of either plane or axisymmetric form .     against @xmath121 ) of the self - similar rupture problem with plane symmetry ( [ eq : planesim ] ) .",
    "the first turning point @xmath164 ( to two decimal places ) is slightly above the first turning point @xmath149 in the axisymmetric problem .",
    "the following three turning points are at @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 . ]",
    "we now compute solutions to the time - dependent evolution of a rupturing film ( [ eq : pde ] ) , and we contrast our results with the similarity solution for different disjoining pressure exponents @xmath3 . in particular , we focus on the difference in behaviour between @xmath168 , where a stable axisymmetric similarity solution exists , to @xmath148 , where no stable axisymmetric similarity solution exists .    the time - dependent computations are performed on a finite spatial domain @xmath169 , such as depicted in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "we thus need two boundary conditions at @xmath56 and two conditions at @xmath43 .",
    "these are @xmath170 recall that @xmath33 is the flow rate in the radial direction per unit length in the angular direction , as defined in ( [ eq : pde ] ) .",
    "the conditions at @xmath56 are necessary for smoothness of the solution at @xmath56 . by expanding the expression for @xmath33 near @xmath56",
    ", it is easily obtained that the zero - flux condition at @xmath56 is equivalent to @xmath171 .",
    "the zero - flux condition at @xmath43 fixes the amount of mass in the system , while the zero - slope condition is chosen for convenience ; with such a condition a uniform film @xmath172 is an exact solution , whose linear stability can be determined analytically .",
    "a more realistic condition may involve a prescribed contact angle @xmath173 , or a pinned contact line @xmath174 , but in any case the condition should not affect self - similar rupture at @xmath56 , so is not important for our purposes .",
    "recall that for the chosen non - dimensionalisation of ( [ eq : pde ] ) , the dimensionless average film thickness is unity , while the domain size @xmath29 is a parameter of the problem . if the derivative of disjoining pressure is such that @xmath175 , the flat film @xmath176 is unstable to perturbations of sufficiently long wavelength .",
    "there is , therefore , a critical domain size @xmath29 above which the flat film becomes unstable , as derived by @xcite ; since the linearisation of ( [ eq : pde ] ) with conditions ( [ eq : bcs ] ) is self - adjoint , the critical value of @xmath29 may be determined from the marginal stability problem : @xmath177 here , @xmath29 is an eigenvalue .",
    "the solution to ( [ eq : stab ] ) may be represented exactly in terms of zeroth - order bessel functions of the first kind , and subsequently the critical value @xmath178 is given by the smallest root of @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the first - order bessel function of the first kind . by our choice of scaling to reach the non - dimensional equation ( [ eq : pde ] ) , @xmath181 for all @xmath182 .",
    "we must therefore choose a domain size @xmath29 greater than @xmath183 in order to observe instability leading to rupture .",
    "in fact , for @xmath0 , witelski and bernoff @xcite showed that there exists a small interval @xmath184 in which there is a stable , axisymmetric , non - uniform solution . in our computations",
    "below , we adopt @xmath185 , which is sufficiently large so that the uniform film is seen to be unstable and a non - uniform stable solution does not exist in all the computations we carry out .      the solution is obtained using the finite - volume method@xcite .",
    "this method involves explicit computation of the fluxes , which means that conservation of mass is guaranteed and flux conditions are easy to implement on the boundaries .",

    "the results for @xmath219 , included in figure [ fig : numsols1a ] , show that the thickness profile develops oscillatory structures and @xmath207 behaves approximately as a power law , but not of the value @xmath220 predicted by the self - similar ansatz ( [ eq : alphabeta ] ) .",
    "instead , by numerically fitting to a large subset of the data we find that the power law exponent is approximately @xmath212 .",

    "again we see the formation of a cascade of oscillatory structures .",
    "it is interesting to note that this secondary behaviour has been observed in previous numerical results pertaining to a thin film destabilised by thermocapillary marangoni stress , not only in the lubrication approximation@xcite but also using the full stokes@xcite and navier - stokes@xcite equations .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the destabilising effect of thermocapillarity is equivalent to a logarithmic disjoining pressure , and corresponds to the special case @xmath49 in our formulation .",
    "our results show that this qualitative behaviour extends to higher values of @xmath3 .    for @xmath168",
    ", the existence of stable self - similar solutions means that finite - time film rupture is generic in this regime .",
    "what is much more difficult to ascertain from the numerics is whether the film ruptures in finite time for smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath224 suggests that for @xmath225 , the minimum thickness behaves roughly as a power law and thus tends to zero in finite time , while for @xmath200 it decays exponentially to zero as @xmath226 .",
    "however , the numerical scheme can not reliably capture the behaviour of solutions of thickness less than the spatial discretisation , a problem encountered by other studies of this problem @xcite .",
    "there is therefore scope for analytical results in this area , as we discuss in the conclusion .",
    "in this study , we have determined self - similar , axisymmetric rupture solutions for a generic thin - film equation that arises in the study of film dewetting due to intermolecular forces . we have shown that for sufficiently large disjoining pressure exponent @xmath3 , discrete solutions exist .",
    "pairs of discrete solution branches merge as @xmath3 decreases , leading to a critical value @xmath4 below which stable self - similar point rupture does not occur .",
    "we also numerically computed solution branches for the plane - symmetric version , showing that the first pair of solution branches merges at @xmath227 .",
    "thus , for @xmath148 , neither self - similar point nor line rupture ( nor ring - rupture in an axisymmetric setting , which behaves locally like line rupture ) is stable , and films will evolve in a non - self - similar fashion .",
    "this prediction is supported by the numerical solution of the full time - dependent problem .",
    "the numerical results also suggest that when @xmath200 , finite - time rupture may not occur at all .",
    "it is certainly plausible that there exists a critical value @xmath228 below which finite - time rupture can not happen , even in a non - self - similar fashion .",
    "there are some related examples for other equations of the form ( [ eq : genpde ] ) .",
    "for instance , bertozzi et al .",
    "@xcite explore the possibility of rupture for the general equation ( [ eq : genpde ] ) with @xmath229 and @xmath230 . in that case",
    "the possibility of finite - time rupture depends on the exponent @xmath96 , and it is proven that finite - time rupture can not occur when @xmath231 . on the other hand , if @xmath232 then the possibility of finite - time blow - up ( @xmath233 as @xmath70 ) is strongly dependent on the exponents @xmath96 and @xmath33@xcite . while our numerical results are not conclusive , they do point to an interesting conjecture , that finite - time rupture for ( [ eq : pde ] ) does not occur for @xmath234 .",
    "it is worth further study to see if such a result can be established rigorously , perhaps using similar methods as those in @xcite .",
    "multiple discrete solutions were found via homotopy continuation by allowing an artificial error parameter @xmath117 in the left - hand boundary conditions to vary .",
    "this method is similar to the one used previously in the plane symmetric case@xcite .",
    "however , the axisymmetric case is made more complicated by the fact that the left - hand boundary condition must be applied at a point @xmath125 , in order to avoid the coordinate singularity at @xmath113 .",
    "an alternative approach would be to introduce an artificial parameter into the system ( [ eq : simodes ] ) in such a way that the boundary conditions are maintained , and the artificial parameter oscillates around zero as the solution value at the origin , @xmath121 , is decreased .",
    "experimentation with the modified system , however , did not result in any obvious way of introducing such a parameter , so we leave this as a topic for future research .    the presence of cascading oscillations in the parameter regime @xmath235 may indicate the existence of ` limit - cycle ' solutions in the self - similar coordinate system , where the steady states ( that is , the self - similar solutions ) are unstable .",
    "the phenomenon of limit cycles in self - similar coordinates has been referred to as ` discrete self - similarity ' , as the self - similarity is seen periodically in ( logarithmic ) time@xcite .",
    "computation of these limit - cycle solutions will require careful linear stability analysis of the higher solution branches ( of the plane - symmetric problem , as for @xmath148 rupture does not generically occur at the origin ) to detect any hopf bifurcations .",
    "in addition , it would be very useful to perform time - dependent computations in the self - similar coordinates ( with a logarithmic time variable ) ; however , this is difficult in practice due to exponentially growing modes that correspond to translations in space and time  @xcite , and is therefore left as a topic for future investigation .",
    "finally , we note that the exponential asymptotic analysis of the plane - symmetric rupture problem with @xmath0 could be extended to both the axisymmetric geometry and general @xmath3 , likely leading to asymptotic behaviour such as ( [ eq : asymp ] ) for the far - field coefficient @xmath134 ( appearing in ( [ eq : ff ] ) ) as the branch number @xmath136 becomes large .",
    "whether it will have the same form as ( [ eq : asymp ] ) with different coefficients , or different powers on @xmath134 , is not immediately clear ; in any case , as this study ( and previous power - law estimates in @xcite ) indicates , obtaining such a delicate asymptotic behaviour from numerical results alone is practically impossible , and using techniques from exponential asymptotics is required .",
    "it is also likely that the asymptotic position of the turning points for large branch number may be obtained from such an analysis .",
    "it is open as to what the asymptotic behaviour of these turning points is ; if , as we suggested above , there is a critical value @xmath236 below which no finite - time rupture is possible , this may coincide with the limiting behaviour of the turning points in the solution branches , as in this case we would not expect to have even unstable similarity solutions for @xmath237",
    ". we shall consider this and related issues in future studies .",
    "this study is a byproduct of extensive discussions with howard stone on thin - film rupture .",
