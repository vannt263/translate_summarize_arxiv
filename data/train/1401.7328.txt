    "an observed trend of increasing blue galaxy fraction with redshift ( the  butcher - oemler  effect ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been interpreted as evidence for higher star formation activity and stellar mass build - up in higher redshift clusters  or alternatively , that star formation is quenched more recently by one or more processes in over - dense regions .",
    "several physical mechanisms can account for the quenching of star formation in over - dense regions ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies in environments with sufficiently low velocity dispersions can be strongly perturbed by mergers .",
    "galaxies can also be transformed more gradually by an ensemble of small perturbations with neighbours , a process called harassment @xcite . tidal forces can strip away a galaxy s halo gas ( starvation ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , cutting off a fuel source for future star formation and leading to a gradual decline in sf activity . in the high - density cores of massive clusters , the hot ( @xmath6 ) intra - cluster medium ( icm ) can quench star formation by removing gas from galaxies via ram - pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "the relative strengths of these physical mechanisms are strongly dependent on the cluster or group properties ( dynamical state , mass , and intra - cluster or intra - group medium ) and environment",
    ".    targeted studies of galaxy clusters or groups at @xmath7 have revealed overwhelming evidence that galaxy transformation occurs not just in dense cluster cores , but at lower densities characteristic of cluster outskirts or galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "studies with star formation tracers in the ir @xcite , uv @xcite , and optical emission - line measures @xcite have shown evidence of _ pre - processing _ , whereby infalling galaxies undergo changes prior to their arrival in the galaxy cluster , or galaxies are transformed entirely in the group environment @xcite .",
    "the pre - processing hypothesis has also been supported by studies of the environmental dependence on galaxy morphology @xcite and colour @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have also been used to study the causes and implications of galaxy pre - processing .",
    "@xcite showed that the dominant physical processes galaxies are likely subjected to in group environments , specifically the frequent weak tidal interactions of harassment , are capable of transforming late - type , disk - dominated galaxies into bulge - dominated , early - types .",
    "furthermore , @xcite used simulations of dark matter halo merger trees , with semi - analytic models ( sams ) to populate the haloes with galaxies , and traced the histories of the simulated galaxies that ended up accreting onto cluster - mass haloes in different epochs . in doing so",
    ", @xcite determined what fraction of those cluster galaxies had resided in haloes characteristic of group - masses for a long enough time to have been pre - processed prior to entering the cluster .",
    "the results of their simulation showed that at low redshift a large fraction of cluster galaxies could have been affected by their environment prior to entering the cluster , while at earlier epochs the fraction of pre - processed galaxies in clusters should steadily decline .",
    "the fraction of cluster galaxies affected by pre - processing in the @xcite simulation depends on the assumed timescale for the physical process(es ) in group environments to affect galaxies , and also has a stellar mass dependence .",
    "although many assumptions go into this simulation , the result highlights a key point that the role of pre - processing has likely varied significantly over cosmic time , and that at @xmath8 pre - processing should be extremely prevalent .",
    "recent studies have suggested that the quenching of sf activity in cosmic history is primarily driven by two distinct , and possibly separable , components : secular evolution ( or ` mass quenching ' ) and environmentally - driven processes ( or  environment quenching  ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , see also @xcite for a discussion about how _ history bias _ affects one s ability to disentangle mass- and environment - quenching .",
    "nevertheless , any attempt to examine the environmental dependence on galaxy evolution must include a careful account for the possibility that one s galaxy selection function has mass biases , particularly since the galaxy stellar mass function is known to vary with environment @xcite .",
    "concerns about biases introduced by the galaxy selection function are compounded when examining galaxies over a wide range in redshift , as one s sensitivity , in galaxy mass and in other properties , like sfr , will undoubtedly also vary with @xmath9 . as a result ,",
    "in many of these studies that extend to higher-@xmath9 one must restrict one s sample to only massive galaxies with high sfrs , and thereby have a less complete picture of the effects of environment on galaxy evolution .",
    "furthermore , studies extending to higher-@xmath9 tend to sample a smaller dynamic range of environments , which similarly reduces one s ability to draw general conclusions about environmentally - driven processes .",
    "a comprehensive view of galaxy evolution in different environments must be sensitive to a large dynamic range of local densities in order to capture not just the dense regions , like clusters and groups , but the more diffuse filament and void regimes .",
    "a key challenge faced when interpreting the many results examining galaxy evolution , in addition to the aforementioned sources of potential bias , is the wide range of methods employed to characterise environment .",
    "recently , @xcite used an array of different environmental mapping techniques , which could be roughly grouped into two categories : nearest - neighbour methods , which measure galaxy density with an aperture that changes depending on the local galaxy density , and fixed - aperture techniques , whose apertures do not vary , to examine a mock galaxy catalogue .",
    "@xcite found that these techniques can analyse the same data set and get different results , but that the nearest - neighbour methods appear to be optimal for mapping the density fields within massive haloes , while the fixed - aperture methods are better suited for probing superhalo distance scales .",
    "therefore , the technique that is optimal to identify large scale structures ( lss ) , like clusters , groups , and filaments , is not necessarily the best choice for measuring the density fields within those structures .    in this work",
    ", we seek to quantify the role of pre - processing in the local universe by analysing the rest - frame colour and star - formation activity of galaxies as a function of environment over about three orders of magnitude in projected density in the coma supercluster . by focusing on a low-@xmath9 field ,",
    "we ensure that our sample of galaxies , taken from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is spectroscopically complete down to dwarf masses ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "furthermore , we do not have to rely on photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath9 ) measurements , which would introduce additional contamination due to interlopers in our sample and significant smearing along the line - of - sight . to map the environments of the supercluster , we employ two complementary techniques : voronoi tessellation ( vt ) and the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) .",
    "the former is a nearest - neighbour - based approach , which can measure the local density field effectively over the large dynamic range of densities that we find in the coma supercluster .",
    "the latter technique is most effective at characterising continuous structures , like clusters , groups , and filaments , and therefore we use the mst to differentiate the types of environment extending over super - halo scales . our combined vt and mst approach allows us to select discrete components of the cosmic web by exploiting the fundamental density contrasts of the cluster , group , filament , and void environments .",

    "studies of the coma supercluster have been primarily focused on the most massive cluster , a1656 .",
    "its low redshift , high galactic latitude ( @xmath21 ) , and richness ensured that it received a great deal of attention from observers in early extragalactic studies ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a significant substructure @xmath01 mpc sw of the centre of a1656 , which has since been positively identified as an infalling group @xcite , was noticed first by the high local concentration of galaxies centred on the galaxy ngc 4839 , and was later confirmed by a diffuse x - ray profile and radial velocities of member galaxies .",
    "@xcite found a large number of ` post - starburst ' ( or k+a ) galaxies coincident with the ngc 4839 group , leading to the conclusion that the ngc 4839 group had experienced a burst of star formation @xmath22 gyr ago @xcite , possibly triggered by tidal effects of the group - cluster merging @xcite .",
    "a study by @xcite , examining emission - line and k+a galaxies in the core region of a1656 , found a spatial correlation between these galaxies and known x - ray sub - structures from @xcite , which indicates that stripping from the shocked icm might be an important factor in triggering starbursts , and subsequent quenching , for infalling galaxies .",
    "studies of the entire supercluster population had to wait for new all - sky surveys with sufficient sensitivity to detect galaxies down to dwarf masses .",
    "furthermore , a positive identification of supercluster members necessitates spectroscopic redshifts , which , prior to the sdss catalog , only existed for the most massive galaxies and those immediately around the two clusters .",
    "@xcite were the first to conduct an extensive survey of the environmental dependence of star - formation activity in galaxies using the sdss , by comparing the sfrs , among other spectroscopic and photometric measures of galaxy properties , to the local density around @xmath0122 000 galaxies in the sdss data release one ( dr1 ) .",
    "they found that for galaxies at fixed stellar masses , the sfrs sharply decline at higher densities , and that the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is also much more common in galaxies with greater local density .",
    "@xcite used @xmath23 low-@xmath9 galaxies in sdss dr4 , and showed a strong bimodal distribution between active and passive sf activity , using the equivalent width ew(h@xmath24 ) , and determined that the passive galaxies preferentially lie in regions with higher local galaxy density .",
    "one of the first major systematic studies of the environmental dependence of galaxy properties across coma , using spectroscopically - confirmed members , was by @xcite .",
    "they used sdss dr7 to select @xmath04000 supercluster members , and characterised the local environment around each galaxy by measuring the volume density of galaxies within a cylinder of radius @xmath25mpc and a half - length of 1000 km s@xmath15 ( but with a slightly modified treatment of galaxies associated with the clusters , as described in appendix [ appendix_b ] ) .",
    "they examined the optical colours , morphologies , and frequency of post - starburst galaxies in different environments , and found a weak dependence of galaxy colour and morphology with environment for the most massive galaxies and a strong dependence of colour and morphology on environment for dwarf galaxies , and also that almost all post - starburst galaxies reside in higher - density regions .",
    "@xcite , using a similar sample of sdss - selected members of coma , examined the local fraction of star - forming and agn - hosting galaxies ( characterised using sdss spectral line measurements ) vs local projected density .",
    "they found a similar broad trend as @xcite , whereby star formation in dwarf galaxies is strongly quenched at higher densities , and more massive galaxies show a weaker dependence on local density .",
    "@xcite also used observations from _ spitzer _",
    "mips at 24@xmath26@xmath27 , which are available only for the core regions of a1656 and a1367 , to obtain a complete accounting of star formation activity in the highest - density regions of coma .",

    "the m@xmath38 cut - off excludes just 130 galaxies , but it s necessary to prevent our sample , which is @xmath39-band selected , from being biased at the lowest galaxy masses towards only those dwarf galaxies which are the most actively star - forming .",

    "@xcite used the emission lines of the sdss galaxy spectra to classify galaxies according to a baldwin , phillips , & terlevich ( bpt ) diagram @xcite , which cleanly delineates those galaxies which host liner and agn emission compared to those dominated by emission from hii regions .",

    "a key component of our analysis is to characterise the local environment in a physically meaningful way .",
    "typically , this approach has involved a calculation of the local surface ( 2d ) or volume ( 3d ) density of galaxies to describe the environment near a given galaxy based on the local density .",
    "a proper characterization of environment requires not just a measurement of the local galaxy density , but a technique to resolve the structures ( groups , filaments , etc . ) traced by galaxies .",
    "the latter task can be very difficult , as lss mapping techniques are often susceptible to biases introduced by a characteristic shape or size scale one is examining .",
    "we have developed a technique to map lss and characterise galaxy environments in a manner which is independent of the shape and size scale of the structure , and allows one to estimate local projected galaxy density over an arbitrarily large dynamic range of densities , by using a combination of voronoi tessellation ( to calculate local surface density ) and the minimal spanning tree ( to resolve continuous structures ) .",
    "vt is a method of decomposing a set of points into polygonal cells ( voronoi cells ) , where each cell corresponds to one point and the boundaries of the cell enclose all of the surrounding space closest to that point .",
    "vt has proven to be a very powerful tool for characterizing the galaxy density field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when using a 2d surface density measurement to define the local galaxy density , one must be careful to not allow projection effects to significantly contaminate the density estimates . to help mitigate this",
    "we are using only spectroscopically - confirmed members .",
    "we show in appendix [ appendix_b ] that our surface densities in the coma supercluster correlate strongly with volume density estimates calculated following the procedures of @xcite . for an additional strong demonstration of the effectiveness of surface density measurements as tracers of the volume density ,",
    "see figure 1 of @xcite , which shows a tight correlation between surface density and volume density over about two orders of magnitude in density being probed in the abell 901/902 supercluster .",
    "a common challenge when trying to measure the galaxy density field is determining the area ( or volume ) over which to measure the density at each galaxy s position .",
    "often the density measurements are made on a size scale set by the n@xmath63 nearest neighbour or by using a characteristic kernel with an adaptive size scale .",
    "although these methods have flexible size scales , the shape of the region used to calculate the density field is generally fixed . calculating densities reliably over a very large dynamic range of environments requires a technique that can adjust to arbitrary size scales _ and _ local geometry .",
    "vt addresses the difficulty of needing both adaptive size and shape by using cells which automatically adjust to the nearby density , and which assume no _ a priori _ shape . in regions of lower source density the cells are larger on average , and the cells get progressively smaller in higher density regions . with vt , one can calculate the local density around a given galaxy s position by taking the inverse of the area of the cell that encloses that galaxy .",
    "we compute the vt of the coma supercluster using the qhull function @xcite in * idl * , which calculates convex hulls for the 2d distribution of points .",
    "a common issue with vt , and with any method of measuring the local density field , is spurious density estimates arising near the edges of the map , where many cells can be artificially large or even unbounded .",
    "we avoid this issue entirely by adding galaxies from the sdss dr9 in a 10 degree - wide ` buffer ' surrounding our coma supercluster map , which all have redshifts consistent with coma and the same selection criteria defined in section [ sdss ] , when calculating our vt .",

    "[ fig : tessduo ] ( left ) we plot the voronoi cells over the supercluster .",

    "[ fig : tessduo ] ( right ) we show the cumulative distribution of cell densities observed in coma compared to the mean cumulative distribution of projected voronoi cell densities for the set of random realizations .",
    "these random maps are necessary to establish a baseline density with which to compare our observed voronoi cell densities in coma .",
    "figure [ fig : tessduo ] ( right ) highlights a couple of key differences between the cell density distribution of the observed supercluster population and that of the random realizations . as one would expect , since the supercluster contains regions of extremely high galaxy density , there is a much larger fraction of cells with densities upwards of 100 - 1000 gal h@xmath64 mpc@xmath65 than in the random distributions .",
    "but we also find that there is a larger fraction of cells in the coma supercluster at very low densities , around 1 - 10 gal h@xmath64 mpc@xmath65 , as a more clustered population implies that one finds more prominent voids as well .",
    "the cumulative distribution of projected cell densities in our full coma catalogue gradually increases over a density range of log(@xmath66)=0.53.5 [ gal h@xmath64 mpc@xmath65 ] , meaning that our supercluster map samples about three orders of magnitude in projected galaxy density .",
    "the random distributions tend to sample about one order of magnitude in galaxy density with any appreciable number of cells .",
    "vt measures the density field across the huge dynamic density range of the supercluster , but it is less effective at resolving continuous structures .",

    "@xcite , hereafter m2010 , presented a table of 110 dwarf k+a galaxies in the coma supercluster , which come from a parent supercluster galaxy sample very similar to that of the present work , and with an identical set of criteria to select the post - starburst galaxies ( see section [ kpa_vs_environ ] ) .",
    "however , we find only 62 such k+a galaxies .",
    "we matched the published m2010 k+a catalogue to our own , and find that 91 of the 110 galaxies proposed by m2010 are indeed in our parent supercluster sample .",
    "however , only 41 of the 110 proposed k+a galaxies from m2010 show spectral characteristics , based on our sdss line measurements , indicative of being k+a .",
    "figure [ fig : h_alpha_delta_compare ] shows the comparison between the m2010 ew(h@xmath24 ) and ew(h@xmath43 ) measurements , and those from the present study , for the 91 proposed k+a galaxies matched to our sample .",
    "it s abundantly clear that there are significant differences in the spectral line measurements for both lines relevant for selecting k+a galaxies , with a prominent systematic offset for h@xmath24 and a large scatter in the measurements of h@xmath43 .",
    "the reasons for these inconsistencies stem from the different techniques used to obtain the line measurements .",
    "the data used in the m2010 catalogue come from the * specline * products , but for the present work we use * galspecline * and * galspecindx * , which are based on the mpa - jhu analysis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "for the * specline * data products , the spectrum continuum is fit using a sliding mean / median filter ( c. tremonti , private comm . ) , while for * galspecline * and * galspecindx * the continuum is fit with stellar population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "the differences in continuum fitting techniques are responsible for most of the systematic offset between h@xmath24 measurements in figure [ fig : h_alpha_delta_compare ] , as the underlying h@xmath24 from the stellar population has not been subtracted from the measurements used in m2010 .",
    "there is also a factor of @xmath68 difference because the * specline * measurements were not converted to the rest - frame , but for the redshift of coma this is a relatively small effect .",
    "the differences seen in h@xmath43 come from a combination of the lack of robust continuum fitting and the fact that the * specline * products measure h@xmath43 using a simple gaussian .",
    "the h@xmath43 measurement used for our present study comes from the lick index h@xmath44 , first proposed by @xcite , and also described in @xcite , which is designed to optimally capture the h@xmath43 absorption feature in the atmospheres of a - type stars ."

    "<S> a similar trend is found using @xmath4 colours , but with a more significant disparity between galaxy mass bins driven by increased internal dust extinction in massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the sfr distributions of massive sf galaxies have no significant environmental dependence , but the distributions for dwarf sf galaxies are found to be statistically distinct in most environments . </S>",
    "<S> pre - processing plays a significant role at low redshift , as environmentally - driven galaxy evolution affects nearly half of the galaxies in the group environment , and a significant fraction of the galaxies in the more diffuse filaments . </S>",
    "<S> our study underscores the need for sensitivity to dwarf galaxies to separate mass - driven from environmentally - driven effects , and the use of unbiased tracers of sf activity .    </S>",
