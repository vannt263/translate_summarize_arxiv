    "if the ring is younger than the star , no planetary influence is necessary apart from the dynamics that led to the collision .",

    "finally , we propose a third formation model in which the ring s morphology is dominated by shepherd planets , analogous to the shepherd moons cordelia and ophelia of uranus s @xmath73 ring @xcite . here , the ring is confined by angular momentum exchange between ring particles and the planets .",

    "* ) at @xmath78 to have the eccentricity observed for the ring ( @xmath79 ) .",

    "mutual perturbations will cause the system to evolve , which narrows parameter space by demanding that interactions between the planets do not destroy the ring . in the massless ring - particle limit , either both planets must be @xmath88 , or they must have an extreme mass ratio .",
    "the planets do not need to be in resonance . a super - earth and a mars - mass planet produce the most narrowly - peaked gaussian for the radial parent body distribution among the simulations presented here .",
    "as the masses for shepherd candidates are comparable to the _ minimum _ estimated parent body mass in the ring , self - gravity of the ring may play a role in the system s evolution .",
    "if the scattered optical light observations have detected fom b , then the candidate could be the innermost shepherd , although there is a discrepancy of @xmath89 au between fom b s proposed @xmath60 and the inner shepherd in our models .",
    "fomalhaut s debris has some similarities to the kuiper belt .",
    "both systems are thin rings , @xmath90 , which seem to owe their morphologies , at least in part , to the presence of planets .",
    "there are nonetheless substantial differences .",
    "the outer edge of the kuiper belt is near the 2:1 resonance with neptune @xcite . for the outer edge of fomalhaut s ring to be at the 2:1 resonance with an interior planet",
    ", the planet would need to have an @xmath91 au . to truncate the ring at this location",
    ", the planet would need to be @xcite and could have been decected by _ spitzer _",
    "if the ring had formed due to outward migration of an interior planet , we would expect particles to be trapped in resonances , like the plutinos in the 3:2 resonance with neptune .",
    "we detect only a single ring .",
    "the kuiper belt has a dynamically hot and cold population with gaussian widths @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively @xcite .",
    "while the kuiper belt object inclination distribution seems to be consistent with truncation due to a stellar flyby @xcite , fomalhaut s parent body population may be too cold to be explained by this mechanism .",
