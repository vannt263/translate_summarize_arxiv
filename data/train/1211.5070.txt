    "the time series of poincar points of the first daughter wave @xmath122 is characterized by weakly chaotic dynamics , and the points remain confined to three narrow bands as shown in fig .

    "the attractor increases in size and becomes the sca .",

    "figure [ fig5](a ) shows the value of the amplitude of the first daughter wave @xmath122 at the @xmath150-th intersection with the poincar map , denoted by @xmath151 , plotted against its third crossing with the map , represented by @xmath152 , using points from a chaotic trajectory at @xmath153 ( thick line ) .",

    "the return map becomes tangent to the line at the same three points ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ) . for @xmath159 , since the dynamics of the attractor changed from chaotic to periodic we construct the return map using points from the surrounding chaotic saddle ( scs , black points ) . due to its fractal nature",
    "the scs has empty spaces or `` gaps '' which prevent us from demonstrating the crossings between the return map and the dashed line .",
    "we solve this by fitting the poincar points of the scs to a curve using a cubic fit , and superposing the interpolated points against the return map .",
    "the return map obtained by this technique is shown as a thin line in fig . [ fig5](c ) .",
    "it is evident that the interpolated points fit well the return map of the scs , and the intersections between the return map and the line @xmath160 clearly demonstrate the creation of a pair of stable - unstable period-3 fixed points .",
    "the interior crisis is characterized by the collision between the wca and the mediating upo and its stable manifold at ic @xcite .",
    "a common technique to compute the stable manifold of an upo requires the integration of the model equations backwards in time @xcite .",
    "however , equations ( [ eq_model1])-([eq_model4 ] ) turned out to be numerically unstable to be solved backwards in time with the traditional numerical integration schemes . since the stable manifold of the mediating upo and the stable manifold of the chaotic saddle are practically indistinguishable @xcite , an alternative approach is to compute the stable manifold of the scs and extract its `` contour '' to represent the stable manifold of the mediating upo near the collision site .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows an overview of the stable ( gray ) and unstable ( red ) manifolds of the scs ( green ) , for @xmath143 .",
    "the wca is shown in black , and the period-3 mediating upo is represented by crosses .",
    "the scs and its stable and unstable manifolds are obtained using the sprinkler method , in which a grid of @xmath101 initial conditions in the @xmath103 plane was defined , and @xmath161 as indicated in section [ sec_chaotic_saddles ] .",
    "we use the following second - degree polynomial obtained by a quadratic fit to set the value of @xmath104 for the initial conditions @xmath162 the chaotic saddles depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and ( d ) have `` gaps '' clearly distinguished as empty spaces that widen with increasing @xmath111 .",
    "after ic , these gaps are densely filled by the sudden appearance of a special set of upos termed coupling upos , because they have components in the surrounding and the band regions of the phase space , coupling them @xcite .",
    "this gap filling is an example of a bifurcation phenomenon called `` explosion '' whereby new recurrent points suddenly appear at a nonzero distance from any pre - existing recurrent points @xcite .",
    "the gap filling is directly responsible for the crisis - induced intermittency observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) , because trajectories can `` escape '' from the banded region to the surrounding region via the unstable manifold of the newly created coupling orbits . in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) we show the post - crisis strong chaotic attractor ( sca , black ) superposed by the period-3 mediating upo ( crosses ) and its stable manifold ( dashed line ) obtained using the contour of the stable manifold of the scs , for @xmath163 . in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) we plot the bcs ( black circles ) and the scs ( gray circles ) which constitute the so called geometrical `` skeleton '' of the post - crisis attractor @xcite .",
    "[ fig9](c ) shows one example of a period-10 coupling upo ( crosses ) . from this figure",
    ", it is clear that the coupling upo has poincar points located in both the surrounding region and the band region .",
    "this coupling upo was detected by applying the newton method to a large set of candidate points , obtained from the poincar points of the sca located within the gaps of either bcs or scs .",
    "in this paper we performed numerical simulations of a model of nonlinear modulational processes in a plasma , which describes the onset of langmuir turbulence .",
    "we demonstrated the existence of shrimp - shaped structures in a two - parameter space . to our knowledge , this is the first time that these structures are detected in a model of nonlinear wave - wave interactions , rendering support to the universal nature of this phenomenon . using two numerical methods , the pim - triple method and the sprinkler method , we identified chaotic saddles and showed their evolution in the bifurcation diagram .",
    "we focused on two types of intermittency , the type - i pomeau - manneville intermittency , related to a saddle - node bifurcation , and the crisis - induced intermittency , related to an interior crisis . both types of intermittency were shown to display power - law behavior as the control parameter departs from the transition point .",
    "after crisis , we were able to detect one example of a coupling unstable periodic orbit connecting two chaotic saddles , directly responsible for the intermittency observed in the time series after crisis .",
    "nonlinear modulational processes can describe the formation of modulated wave envelopes in plasmas and fluids which are often observed as intermittent `` bursts '' in a time series .",
    "for example , in astrophysical plasmas , observational data of radio signals from pulsars display strong bursts that are intermittent in time @xcite .",
    "theoretical models of modulational processes can also be used to explain the formation of extreme or `` freak '' waves in oceans , which are isolated , anomalously high - amplitude ocean waves , exceeding at least 2.2 times the significant wave height , which is defined as the average of the highest one - third of nearby waves @xcite , and can appear intermittently in space or time , generally under rough sea conditions @xcite . in the open ocean , freak waves can be produced by nonlinear self - modulation of a slowly - varying wave train @xcite .",
    "simple nonlinear solutions of the nls equation can serve as prototypes of freak waves in the open ocean , as shown by several theoretical works @xcite and recent laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "a system of two coupled nls equations were derived by @xcite , to describe the modulational instability in the ocean .",
    "their model can explain the occurrence of freak waves in crossing sea states .",
    "@xcite derived a nls - type equation in which the bottom stress is taken into account , and found that the bottom friction can affect the formation of freak waves via a modulational instability .",
    "however , the three travelling waves truncation of eq .",
    "( [ eq_schrodinger_2 ] ) imposes some constraints on the applicability of this model to interpret the intermittent features observed in plasmas and fluids .",
    "the choice of one pump wave and one pair of daughter waves might be justified in a weakly nonlinear regime , in which other sets of waves are strongly damped . in this regime .",
    "low - dimensional models of nonlinear wave - wave interactions can be used as an alternative to describe modulational processes in plasmas and fluids .",
    "for example , @xcite compared numerical simulations of the derivative nonlinear schrdinger equation with simulations of a reduced model consisting of three travelling waves in a plasma , and found that the reduced model is in agreement with the dnls when the energy in the system is small and right - hand polarized waves are present .",
    "@xcite showed that , when the wave steepening is sufficiently weak , the theory of nonlinear four - wave interactions is in good agreement with direct simulations of an ensemble of ocean waves using zakharov equations and nonlinear schrdinger equation , and can explain the formation of freak waves .",
    "hence , the model used in this paper may be useful to describe qualitatively the dynamics of nonlinear modulational interactions . in summary ,",
    "our work offers a theoretical explanation for the generation of intermittent bursts resulting from the interaction of chaotic saddles and coupling unstable periodic orbits , and provides new insights to the understanding of these nonlinear phenomena commonly observed in plasmas and fluids .",
