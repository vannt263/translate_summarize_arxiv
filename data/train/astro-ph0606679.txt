    "the process of the electron capture by the nucleus @xmath0be is important since it contributes to the low energy part of the spectrum of neutrinos radiated by the sun . besides",
    ", it is obvious that the balance of the disappearance channels of @xmath0be in the sun regulates the amount of the nucleus @xmath5b which is the source of the high energy solar neutrinos .",
    "this is the main reason why this process attracted considerable attention over many years @xcite .",
    "practically all the discussion so far of the electron capture in @xmath0be is concentrated on considering the electron wave function in the vicinity of the nucleus and on the screening effects on it ; the study of this capture in the plasma was done in ref.@xcite .    in what follows",
    "we will estimate the role of the process that is usually not included in the standard theory of the @xmath6 cycle in the sun .",
    "let us first note that in the standard theory of this cycle the destruction of the nucleus @xmath0be takes place in the following binary reactions @xmath7 since the nucleus @xmath0be participates in both processes , instead of the binary reactions ( [ br1 ] ) and ( [ br2 ] ) we consider the contribution to the electron capture rate from the three - particle initial state . in this case the following reactions can take place @xmath8 as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the screening corrections for the electrons in the continuum are rather small .",
    "therefore , we consider in the initial state the bare coulomb interaction in all two - body subsystems @xmath9 , @xmath10be , and @xmath11be .",
    "in this case one can immediately realize that there is a qualitative difference between the binary and ternary mechanisms of the electron capture .",
    "indeed , if one starts from the three - body initial state , then the processes ( [ br1 ] ) and ( [ br2 ] ) should be interdependent because the wave function of three charged particles can not be presented as a product of pair wave functions , as is required by the binary processes ( [ br1 ] ) and ( [ br2 ] ) . here",
    "we apply the method and results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite where an alternative to the born - oppenheimer approach has been suggested for the calculations of wave functions in the continuum for three charged particles .",
    "in analogy with the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the continuum wave function of three charged particles can be expanded in a small parameter @xmath12 , @xmath13^{1/2 } \\,\\approx\\,\\left[\\frac{m_e}{m_p}\\right]^{1/2}\\ , ,   \\label{eps}\\ ] ] where , in addition to the electron and proton mass , also @xmath14 , the mass of the nucleus @xmath0be , enters .",
    "the expansion of the wave function of the studied three - body system is then @xmath15 since the parameter @xmath16 one expects the effects of the second term at the right hand side of eq.([exp ] ) at the level of 2 % in comparison with the first term .",
    "it was found in @xcite that in the limit @xmath17 the jacobi coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) separate .",
    "it means that the structure of the wave function @xmath20 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the coulomb wave function describing the relative motion of the proton and the nucleus @xmath0be , and @xmath23 is the coulomb wave function that describes the motion of the electron in the field of the effective coulomb potential of the charge @xmath24 .",
    "the crucial point is that the wave function @xmath25 depends on the distance between the electron and the center of mass of the subsystem of heavy particles .",
    "it means that even if the distance between the electron and the nucleus @xmath0be is zero , as is required by the hamiltonian of the weak interaction , the wave function @xmath23 , defining the probability of the electron capture by the nucleus @xmath0be , should be taken at a non - zero distance latexmath:[$|\\vec",
    "r|=\\beta    @xmath0be masses .",
    "it is clear that this phenomenon appears due to the electron movement in the coulomb field of two charged particles with positive charges .",
    "following the arguments presented above we now consider two effects acting in the opposite directions .",
    "on one hand , increasing the effective positive charge of the heavy particles system by one unit will enlarge the electron capture rate .",
    "on the other hand , using the coulomb wave function at finite distances instead of the function taken at zero distance should damp the capture rate .    taking into account that the nuclear matrix elements of the reactions ( [ br2 ] ) and ( [ 3a ] ) are the same , as a measure of influence of the third particle ( the proton in this case ) on the capture rate of electrons by the nuclei @xmath0be we introduce the ratio @xmath27 , which is the function of the distance @xmath28 between the particles and the temperature @xmath29 , @xmath30 here the denominator on the right - hand side of the equation contains the quantity that enters the electron capture rate from the continuum for the reaction ( [ br2 ] ) @xcite . the fermi function @xmath31 is given by the equation @xmath32 where the parameter @xmath33 is given by the equation @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath36 is the electron momentum .",
    "it is obtained by using the solution of the dirac equation with the coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "analogous integral in the numerator should reflect the effect of the coulomb potential on the electron in the continuum for the reaction ( [ 3a ] ) . for the wave function @xmath37",
    ", we use the coulomb continuum wave function for the state with zero angular momentum @xmath38 where the function @xmath39 satisfies the equation @xmath40\\,f_0\\,=\\,0\\ , , \\label{def0}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the sommerfeld parameter . the function @xmath39 can be expressed in terms of the kummer function @xmath14 ( see ref.@xcite , chap.14 ) as @xmath43 where @xmath44 .    instead of the quantity @xmath27 , one can consider @xmath45 using eq.([def0 ] ) , one obtains @xmath46 which is of the same form as the fermi function ( [ ff ] ) ; however @xmath47 .",
    "one can find the following integral representation ( see ref.@xcite , chap.13 ) @xmath48 for this function . in the numerical calculations of the integral over energy in eqs.([rb ] ) and ( [ rcb ] ) , we used this representation of the kummer function for the energies @xmath49 kev . in the interval",
    "@xmath50 kev , the function under the integral in eq.([kf ] ) strongly oscillates which makes the calculations difficult .",
    "instead , we applied the program pfq developed in ref .",
    "let us note that for the energies @xmath49 kev the program pfq and eq.([kf ] ) provide the same results to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "we also introduce the mean value @xmath51 of the function @xmath27 @xmath52 where @xmath53 \\ , \\label{n}\\ ] ] is the normalization constant . in eq.([n ] ) , the function @xmath54 is the error function ( see ref.@xcite , chap.7 ) . it can be seen from eq.([bs ] ) that the quantity @xmath51 depends on the mean distance @xmath55 between the particles defined by the density in the sun and on the temperature @xmath29 . the mean value @xmath56 is defined analogously by using @xmath57 .    we checked the precision of numerical calculations of the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath56 by using mathematica@xmath58 and also independent numerical procedures .",
    "the results of these two independent ways of calculations agree within the required accuracy , which is .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented in table i and figs.[fig2] [ fig4 ] .    in fig.[fig2 ] , the dependence of the mean value given in eq.([bs ] ) on the temperature @xmath29 and the value of the mean distance @xmath55 is shown .",
    "a weak dependence of on the temperature means , as it follows from eq.([rb ] ) , that the temperature dependence of the electron capture by @xmath0be is almost the same for the ternary and binary reactions .",
    "such a behaviour can be understood from the fact that in both cases only rarely is all the kinetic energy carried by one particle , which is the electron . on the other hand",
    ", the dependence of on the value of @xmath55 shows that the contribution to the capture rate of the ternary reaction is presumably suppressed in stars but it can be at the same level as the contribution to the capture rate for the binary reaction or even prevail over it at very high densities .",
    "this is natural because at short distances between the particles the factor of the larger effective charge acting on the electron will dominate .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from fig.[fig3 ] . in this figure ,",
    "the solid and dashed curves practically coincide .",
    "this again shows a very smooth dependence of on the temperature .",
    "let us note that the values of the @xmath55 , considered in fig.[fig2 ] , correspond to rather dense stars .",
    "for example , the value of corresponds to the proton density @xmath59 g/@xmath60 , which is about 11 times larger than in the center of the sun .",
    "let us further discuss the electron capture by @xmath0be solely in the sun .    in table",
    "i , we show the influence of protons on the electron capture in the sun in more detail . for the standard solar model",
    ", we choose model ssmbp2004 @xcite . according to fig.6.1 of ref.@xcite",
    ", the maximal intensity of the electron capture by the nuclei @xmath0be takes place at the distance @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the radius of the sun , and it drops to one half at @xmath63 and @xmath64 . using the data on the temperature , the density , and the fraction of the hydrogen in this area of the sun , we obtain the mean values and presented in table i. in the second column , we add the mean value calculated at @xmath65 = 0.007 which is close to the very centre of the sun",
    ". it can be seen that the change of the average quantities and is very smooth .",
    "table i. the mean values and for the electron capture by the nuclei @xmath0be in the sun .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as can be seen from the first row of table i and from fig.[fig4 ] , the contribution to the capture rate of the ternary reaction at the sun is about 10 % of the binary one ) is expected to change it only by @xmath66 2 % . ] .",
    "this means that it should increase sensibly the burning out of the nuclei @xmath0be in comparison with the binary reaction , thus decreasing the concentration of the nuclei @xmath5b that appear after the capture of protons by @xmath0be .",
    "comparing the first and the second rows of table i shows a difference of 3 % between the values of and .",
    "this variation arises from the difference between the relativistic and nonrelativistic estimations of the electron wave function at zero distance for the binary reaction ( [ br2 ] ) .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "we show the variation of for the reaction ( [ 3a ] ) for larger intervals of @xmath29 and @xmath55 .",
    "one can consider in analogy the influence of the nuclei @xmath67he on the electron capture by @xmath0be in the sun . in this case ,",
    "@xmath68 , @xmath69 , and at the radius @xmath70 the mean distance between the nuclei @xmath67he is @xmath71 fm .",
    "then one obtains from eq.([bs ] ) that = 0.0036 , which is about 27 times smaller that the analogous value of for the protons given in the fourth column of table i. evidently , this influence on the electron capture is negligible .",
    "this can also be seen from fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the main conclusion following from our calculations is that the three - body process due to the presence of the proton in the vicinity of the nucleus @xmath0be results in the capture of the electron by an effective charge @xmath72 instead of @xmath73 , which is qualitatively the new effect that can not be simulated by introducing the debye screening .",
    "this effect can increase the rate of the electron capture from the continuum by @xmath0be in the sun , which will reduce the concentration of the nuclei @xmath5b that appear after the capture of protons by @xmath0be .",
