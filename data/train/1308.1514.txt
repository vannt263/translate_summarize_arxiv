    "thus , it is natural to question how cell polarity contributes to chemotaxis .",

    "_ dictyostelium _",
    "cells spontaneously polarize and migrate in random directions in the absence of extracellular cues .",
    "this polarity manifests as self - organization in signaling systems  @xcite , polarized structures in the cytoskeletal network , and localization of subcellular organelles . to distinguish these polarities from specific cell - shapes and anisotropy in external environments ,",
    "we collectively label them as `` internal polarity '' .",
    "spontaneous internal polarity in the absence of extracellular polarity implies a spontaneous breakdown of the internal isotropy or rotational symmetry",
    ". such spontaneous violation of a continuous symmetry can be illustrated by a state point in the bottom of a potential shaped like a mexican hat , as illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : introduction]a .",
    "this symmetry breaking is accompanied by a memory effect associated with a slowly - changing directional parameter . in other words , in the asymmetric state , cells maintain their current direction .",
    "by contrast , in the symmetric state , directional information rapidly dissipates  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : introduction]a left ) .",
    "asymmetric polarity is considered to underlie the persistence of cell migration over a characteristic period of time , called the persistence time .",
    "the persistence time of _ dictyostelium _ cells ranges from @xmath7 to @xmath8 sec , depending on the chemoattractant concentration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spontaneoustvse]b ) , much longer than the time constant of the chemoattractant - receptor reaction ( @xmath9 sec ) .",
    "such spontaneous intracellular polarities are essential to high chemotactic accuracy . under shallow gradients , activities in the signal transduction network",
    "are modulated by small changes in the likelihood of association between receptor and chemoligand , which induce gradient responses . in the presence of homogeneously - distributed chemoattractant",
    ", the distribution of receptor occupancy along the cell periphery fluctuates due to its inherent stochasticity .",
    "similar to external gradients , these spatial fluctuations can also drive the cell to orientate in a different direction  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a short chemoattractant stimulus of 1 sec . , which is similar to the time constant of receptor - ligand reaction  @xcite , can modulate the state in the signaling pathway of gradient sensing in _ dictyostelium _ cell @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that random cell migration under uniform conditions is linked to the gradient response . because the fluctuations in receptor occupancy depend on the chemoattractant concentration , this concentration might also affect random cell migration . by building these two quantities into a theoretical framework and testing the theory by experiment",
    ", we can understand not merely how they are connected , but also elucidate how symmetry breaking contributes to chemotaxis in shallow chemical gradients .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we seek the connection between random cell migration in a uniform chemoattractant and chemotaxis in shallow gradients .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the persistence of cell migration  @xcite .",
    "chemotactic cell migrations have also received theoretical treatment @xcite . however",
    ", none of the existing theoretical models can explain chemotaxis in shallow gradients or its relevance to random cell migration in a uniform chemoattractant .",
    "first , we study the persistence of random cell migration established by spontaneous internal polarity ( figs .  [",
    "fig : introduction]b and c ) .",
    "we found that the persistence time obtained from the correlation function of migration direction depends on chemoattractant concentration , indicating a chemokinetic effect .",
    "we then introduce directional bias by applying an external gradient ( figs .",
    "[ fig : introduction]b and c ) . considering that the internal polarity responsible for the persistence time is equally applicable to chemotaxis",
    ", we demonstrate that cell polarity enhances the chemotactic accuracy . finally , we determine the model parameters by comparing our theoretical results with experimental data of randomly migrating _ dictyostelium _ cells in a uniform condition .",
    "we show that cell polarity can account for the the high accuracy of chemotaxis exhibited by _",
    "cells in fisher s study _",
    "we first consider cell migration under uniform conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ in the absence of a chemoattractant gradient .",
    "as mentioned above , we consider a spontaneously maintained internal polarity in the intracellular process .",
    "the cells migrate in the direction of the internal polarity , which is subject to change by intra- and extra - cellular perturbations . for simplicity , we assume that the magnitude of the internal polarity and the migration speed are constant .",
    "intracellular perturbations originate from stochastic variability of signal reactions and other processes .",
    "such perturbations introduce randomness to the internal polarity , leading to random cell migration .",
    "the random orientation of the polarity direction  @xmath10 can be described by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a random perturbation described by white gaussian noise with @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the absence of extra - cellular perturbation ,",
    "the total noise strength is @xmath15 ( rad@xmath16/sec ) , where @xmath17 is the dispersion strength of intracellular stochastic perturbations .",
    "when the cell is exposed to a spatially uniform chemoattractant , the stochastic binding of receptors and chemoattractant ligands constitutes another noise source .",
    "the information of the binding states at a particular time decays exponentially with time constant @xmath18 . here , @xmath18 is the correlation time of the receptor state , given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the dissociation and association rates , respectively , and @xmath22 is the dissociation constant .",
    "we denote the average impact of individual changes in the binding state on the internal polarity by @xmath23 . the integrated noise strength during time interval @xmath18 scales as @xmath24 .",
    "since the noise dispersion is proportional to the square of the noise strength , the dispersion of the extracellular - noise contribution @xmath25 through receptors is estimated as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of independent events per unit time .",
    "thus , the dispersion is given by @xmath28 the numerical factor , @xmath29 , is given by the detailed calculation in materials and models ( eq . ) .",
    "while internal polarity dictates the moving direction of the cell , the direction of the internal polarity fluctuates stochastically under intra- and extra- cellular perturbations , as explained above .",
    "therefore , with the resulting increase in total dispersion , @xmath30 , the correlation time @xmath31 of the migration direction or the internal polarity should decrease .",
    "given that the angular diffusion constant @xmath32 has an inverse time unit , the correlation time @xmath31 is given by @xmath33 .",
    "for a detailed derivation of this relation , see eq . in materials and models .",
    "thus , from eqs . and , the correlation time @xmath31 is given by @xmath34 this equality ( eq . ) indicates that the motile behavior of cells depends upon chemoattractant concentration , even if the chemoattrantant is homogeneously distributed in space .",
    "the correlation time @xmath31 increases with increasing average concentration @xmath35 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spontaneoustvse]b ( blue solid line ) . by fitting eq . to the measured concentration dependence of the correlation time , and",
    "knowing the values of the receptor parameters , we can estimate the values of parameters @xmath23 and @xmath17 .      in the presence of chemoattractant gradients , cells perform gradient sensing , and orient their internal polarity in the direction of the gradient .",
    "the quality of the gradient sensing may depend on the stochasticity in the receptor states . when the noise increases or decreases relative to the signal strength , the accuracy of gradient sensing may decrease or increase , respectively  @xcite . thus , the effective gradient information , which we quantify by a non - dimensional parameter @xmath36 , may decrease if the stochastic noise increases .",
    "this bias @xmath36 also depends on the chemoattractant concentration and the steepness of the gradient .",
    "the response of cells to gradient perturbations should depend on the responsiveness @xmath23 ( rad / sec ) , introduced above . as @xmath23 increases",
    ", the chemoattractant gradient should exert greater effect .",
    "thus , the `` driving force ''",
    "@xmath37 exerted on the internal polarity depends on both the bias and the responsiveness , which may be expressed as @xmath38 ( for details of the derivation , see eq . . )",
    "fisher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite specifies the accuracy @xmath39 by the sharpness of the distribution @xmath40 of migration directions @xmath41 , defined by @xmath42 .",

    "@xmath39 is also expected to be proportional to the bias @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath39 should improve as the stochastic perturbations @xmath45 decrease , or conversely , as the correlation time @xmath31 increases .",
    "these conditions are satisfied if @xmath39 takes the form @xmath46 ( details of the derivation are provided in materials and models ; see eq . ) .    to see the significance of the internal polarity on the chemotactic accuracy , we consider the ratio between the chemotactic accuracy @xmath39 and the bias @xmath36 , denoted as the amplification ratio @xmath47 .",

    ", we observe that the amplification is maximized ( @xmath55 ) at @xmath56 .",
    "these results suggest that , for a given value of @xmath17 , there exists an optimum responsiveness @xmath23 that maximizes the chemotactic accuracy .",
    "this maximum accuracy is achieved when the external and intrinsic perturbations are balanced .",
    "if the responsiveness @xmath23 is small , the correlation time  @xmath31 in eq . is almost independent of  @xmath23 , because the dispersion is dominated by the intrinsic stochastic perturbation @xmath17 .",
    "simultaneously , the external driving force @xmath37 in eq . is strengthened as @xmath23 increases .",
    "therefore , for small responsiveness @xmath23 , the accuracy @xmath39 increases proportionally to the responsiveness @xmath23 .",

    "as we have mentioned , the stochastic binding of chemoattractant by the receptor contributes additional noise to the internal polarity . because the characteristic time of the receptor depends on the chemoattractant concentration as shown in eq .",
    ", the correlation time of the migration direction should depend on the chemoattractant concentration , as predicted in eq .  .",
    "to investigate this expected phenomenon , we tracked the migration of single _ dictyostelium _ cells in uniform camp concentrations ( see materials and models ) .",
