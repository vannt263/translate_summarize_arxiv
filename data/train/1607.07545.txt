    "weak gravitational lensing refers to the small but coherent distortion of intrinsic galaxy images by inhomogeneous mass distribution @xcite . since",
    "weak lensing is a pure gravitational effect , it has a wide application in cosmology , including : probing the large scale matter distribution ; constraining cosmological parameters @xcite ; determining the connection between visible galaxies and dark matter through galaxy - galaxy lensing measurement @xcite ; constraining theories of gravity on cosmological scales @xcite .",
    "precise measurement of weak lensing is one of the primary goals of several cosmological surveys ( e.g. , des , hsc , kids , lsst , wfirst ) .",
    "weak lensing induces percent - level coherent shape distortions to the galaxies .",
    "it is well known that smearing due to the point spread function ( psf hereafter ) caused by the atmosphere and telescope is significantly larger than the weak lensing signal . in addition , the photon noise and the pixelation effect are also sources of contamination to the cosmic shear signal .",
    "it is therefore a challenging task to construct unbiased shear estimators @xcite .",
    "typically , quadrupole moments of observed galaxy images are used to construct shear estimator .",
    "it can be shown that a straightforward way of removing the psf effect in shear measurement is to subtract the quadrupole moments of the psf from those of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we notice that this method is not applied in practice .",
    "the most important reason is that the photon noise adds a significant contribution to the measurement of the quadrupole moments of an image , especially at large distances from the center of the source .",
    "most commonly , an additional weight function ( e.g. , gaussian ) of a reasonable size is applied to the image to limit the noise contribution to the shape measurement@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of the weight function leads to a series of other corrections to the shear measurement that are typically hard to calculate .",
    "furthermore , precise measurement of the quadrupole moments always requires an accurate determination of the centroid position of the source , which is difficult in the presence of noise and finite pixel size .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to understand if the noise and centroid problems can be solved by extending the framework of @xcite along another line of thought .",
    "@xcite has proposed to use quadrupole moments of the galaxy power spectrum in fourier space to do shear estimation .",
    "it is found that the centroid problem can be avoided in the fourier domain , and the shear bias from the background and the poisson noise can be systematically removed @xcite ( zlf15 hereafter ) . taking the advantage of zlf15 , we consider applying the idea of @xcite to the auto - convolved galaxy image , which is simply the inverse fourier transformation of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "it turns out that the psf effect can be similarly removed by subtracting the quadrupole moments of the auto - convolved psf from those of the auto - convolved galaxy , instead of transforming the original psf to a gaussian form as done in zlf15 .",
    "both the background noise and the poisson noise can be removed in fourier space statistically . moreover",
    ", this novel method has several other advantages : 1 ) it only needs the quadrupole moments of auto - convolved psf instead of its full morphology ; 2 ) the psf image / moments can contain noise , the effect of which can also be systematically removed ; 3 ) it involves simple and fast image processing procedures .    in  [ s - method ] , we review the relation between the cosmic shear and galaxy quadrupole moments , and introduce the idea of autoconvolution in shear estimation . in  [ s - test ]",
    ", we test the performance of the new method in general conditions .",
    "we also study the requirement on the galaxy stamp / aperture size for avoiding shear recovery error due to the spatial extension of the galaxy profile .",
    "this is neccessary also for avoiding possible interferences from neighbouring objects in real observations .",
    "a brief summary is given in ",
    "[ s - summary ] .",
    "setting the origin of the coordinates at the centroid of galaxy image , one can describe the weak lensing effect as a linear mapping between the intrinsic galaxy image @xmath0 and the lensed image @xmath1 as @xmath2 where ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 the two components of the reduced shear ( @xmath5 ) describe the stretching of galaxy images , and the convergence @xmath6 describes a change in size and brightness for the galaxy image . for convenience in the following discussion , we set @xmath7 , which does not affect our conclusions . assuming the intrinsic galaxy image is statistically isotropic , one can construct the shear estimator with the quadrupole moments of lensed galaxy image as @xcite @xmath8 in which the quadrupole moments of the lensed galaxy image are defined as ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 note that the moments can be normalized by the flux of the source galaxy . in the presence of psf , the shear estimator must be constructed as a function of the observed galaxy ( @xmath11 ) , which is the convolution of the lensed galaxy ( @xmath1 ) and the psf ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 in this case , shear estimators can be built on the moments of the galaxy and psf images as @xcite @xmath14 where the moments of galaxy and psf are defined as ( @xmath9 ) @xmath15 the math details are shown in appendix [ app - pr ] .",
    "real images are recorded on ccd pixels with noise present .",
    "for shear estimator of eq.([estimator revised ] ) to be useful in practice , it requires an accurate determination of the centroid of the source image , and a procedure to remove the shear bias due to noise .",
    "as pointed out by zlf15 , the image of the galaxy power spectrum can be equally used for shear measurement .",
    "more importantly , the centroid of the power spectrum is fixed in the fourier domain , and the noise power can be removed from the source power statistically due to their distinct features in fourier space .",
    "we are therefore strongly motivated to apply the method of eq.([estimator revised ] ) on images related to the power spectrum of the source .",
    "it turns out that the auto - convolved source images , i.e. , the inverse fourier transformation of the source power spectrum , can be used to define the moments in eq.([estimator revised ] ) for the purpose of shear recovery .",
    "the autoconvolution of an image in our case can be defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 could represent the intrinsic galaxy @xmath0 , the lensed galaxy @xmath1 , the observed galaxy @xmath11 , or the psf @xmath12 , and @xmath18 could represents the corresponding auto - convolved image @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "the auto - convolved image has 4 good properties : + 1 ) the auto - convolved image changes likes eq.([shear equation ] ) under the distortion by lensing @xmath23 + 2 ) the autoconvolution of the observed galaxy ( @xmath21 ) is the convolution of the auto - convolved lensed galaxy ( @xmath20 ) and the auto - convolved psf ( @xmath22 ) @xmath24 + 3 ) it is always symmetric to the origin ( see fig.[[auto - convolved image ] ] ) @xmath25 so the centroid of auto - convolved image is always well defined .",
    "+ 4 ) the auto - convolved image @xmath18 is the inverse fourier transformation of the power spectrum @xmath26 @xmath27 in which the power spectrum is defined as @xmath28 therefore autoconvolution can be carried out using fast fourier transformation .",
    "it turns out that the above properties allow us to construct shear estimators similar to eq.([estimator revised ] ) using the moments of @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath29 the corresponding shear estimators are @xmath30 the math details are shown in appendix [ app - ac ] .    , but for the method of zlf15 .",
    ", width=302,height=226 ]      the terms on the right side of eq.([estimator centroid ] ) are contaminated by noise , including both background noise and source poisson noise .",
    "as shown in zlf15 , the background noise contribution can be estimated and directly subtracted using a background noise image near the galaxy location , because they are not correlated with the source shapes .",
    "the source poisson noise statistically exhibits a scale - independent power spectrum in fourier space , therefore its contribution can be estimated at large wave - numbers , and subtracted from the source power spectrum on all scales .",
    "these procedures can similarly be applied in our new method not only for the galaxy , but also for the psf , owing to the fact that the new shear estimators linearly depend on the power spectra of both the galaxy and the psf . in practice",
    ", the psf power at the position of the galaxy can be constructed as a weighted sum of the power spectra of its neighboring stars , each of which is subtracted by the power of its companion background noise image in the neighborhood .",
    "it is in this sense that the new method allows the presence of noise in the psf , an important feature that is not shared by zlf15 .",
    "let us denote the auto - convolved images of background noise for galaxy and psf as @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively . to remove the noise bias , the moments of galaxy and psf",

    "in this section , we use simulated galaxy and star images to test the accuracy of the new method under general conditions . we choose to use circular top - hat aperture to define the galaxy area for shear measurement . an important issue to address is about the convergence of the quadrupole moments as a function of radius , which determines the aperture sizes for the sources .",
    "we consider realistic galaxy and psf profiles , and compare the results with those using the method of zlf15 in  [ s - test - cut - off ] .",

    "each galaxy is placed on a @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is integer ) postage stamp . the pixel size is defined as the length unit .",
    "we use a number of points to simulate every galaxy .",
    "the advantage of point source is that one can apply image distortions ( lensing , rotation , ellipticity ) by directly moving the points , and can add the psf effect by directly turning each point into a 2d profile .",
    "all these procedures can be done without doing any interpolations on the pixel - by - pixel basis @xcite .",
    "we generate point sources that are homogeneously distributed within a round disk to simulate an intrinsic face - on galaxy image .",

    "fig.[[fig_cut_a ] ] shows that our new method performs well for compact sersic galaxies ( @xmath60 ) and the cut - off ratio should be larger than @xmath49 to ensure that multiplicity error is within @xmath61 .",

    "the results show that the required aperture size ( in terms of galaxy s half - light radius ) for the new method is more strongly dependent on the galaxy morphology than the method of zlf15 .",
    "we also show that the new method works well in the presence of noise , albeit with a larger statistical error than zlf15 .",
    "these issues remain to be improved .",
    "a possible solution to these problems is to downweight the contribution of pixels at large distances from the image center .",
    "however , it seems that a nontrivial weighting function ( comparing to our current circular top - hat function ) neccessarily requires more complicated psf correction procedures , as discussed in many other works .",
