    "the doped manganite compounds r@xmath7a@xmath1mno@xmath8 ( r = rare earth ; a = alkaline earth ) have been intensively investigated concerning their colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) properties @xcite .",
    "simultaneous ferromagnetic ( fm ) and metallic properties in these manganese oxides are attributed to double exchange @xcite ( de ) interaction between pairs of mn@xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and mn@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) ions .",
    "substitution of cations with different sizes at the rare earth sites results in lattice distortions that may influence the ferromagnetic de and the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) superexchange interactions differently , for instance increasing the importance of the afm interactions with respect to the fm interactions .",
    "this can create various forms of magnetic disorder , thereby also affecting the transfer integral for itinerant @xmath13 electrons which depends on the relative spin orientation of the localized @xmath14 moments ; @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angle between moments @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . in systems with ferromagnetic de interaction dominating ,",
    "the afm interactions may still cause magnetic disorder and frustration and the system is in this case expected to show a low temperature reentrant spin glass ( rsg ) phase @xcite .",
    "when such a system is cooled from a high temperature , it first exhibits a transition from a paramagnetic ( pm ) to a ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase .",
    "if the cooling proceeds , a transition to a rsg phase occurs .",
    "indications of such a transition have already been reported for cmr compounds , but without presenting convincing experimental evidences for its existence .",
    "usually , the authors consider that a low temperature cusp in the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) magnetisation , leading to a difference between the zfc and field cooled ( fc ) magnetisation curves at low temperatures , is enough to evidence a low temperature rsg phase @xcite .",
    "ac - susceptibility measurements are sometimes added ; a frequency dependent ac - susceptibility is then attributed to the rsg phase@xcite .",
    "but , even if these features are indicative of a deviation from a perfectly ordered ferromagnetic state , they are not sufficient to prove a low temperature rsg phase . moreover , it is possible to envisage other disordered magnetic phases resulting from a competition between ferromagnetic de and antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions .",
    "low temperature spin canted af and fm phases were suggested in the pioneering work of de gennes @xcite .",
    "more recent work indicates that the canted phase is unstable against electronic phase separation and the formation of hole rich ferromagnetic and hole undoped antiferromagnetic regions @xcite .",
    "thus , other and complementary experiments must be performed to dissolve the details of the magnetic phase diagram of the manganese perovskites .",
    "for example in a disordered and frustrated magnetic system like a spin glass , the zero - field cooled ( zfc ) magnetisation relaxes in a characteristic way if the temperature is kept constant ; therefore time - dependent zfc magnetisation measurements may be used to study the evolution of the spin configuration and the possible occurrence of a rsg phase .",
    "+ in the present study , we investigate effects of ion size mismatch induced by replacing la@xmath9 with nd@xmath9 in the manganese oxide la@xmath0nd@xmath1k@xmath2mno@xmath3 .",
    "a rsg phase transition , creating a second peak in the magnetoresistance when applying a sufficiently large magnetic field , is revealed from zfc relaxation measurements .",
    "the results give evidence in support of a recent proposal that the afm superexchange interaction is one mechanism responsible for spin disorder and that the de ferromagnetic interaction is more strongly affected by a variation of the @xmath19 bond with cation substitution@xcite .",
    "single - phase la@xmath0nd@xmath1k@xmath2mno@xmath3 , with @xmath6 ranging from 0 to 0.4 in steps of 0.1 were prepared by solid state reaction between la@xmath20o@xmath8 , nd@xmath20o@xmath8 , mno@xmath20 and k@xmath20co@xmath8 in stoichiometric proportions .",
    "substitution of nd@xmath9 at the la@xmath9 site , nd@xmath9 having a smaller ionic radius , modifies the @xmath19 bond angle and the @xmath21 bond length .",
    "structure and composition of the obtained compounds were checked by room temperature x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) on a high resolution stoe transmission diffractometer equipped with a position - sensitive detector .",
    "the scanning range was @xmath22- @xmath23 and cuk@xmath24 radiation was used for all data collections .",
    "we observe a change in structure from rhombohedral @xmath25 to orthorhombic @xmath26 ; table [ table1 ] gives a summary of the structural data ; the change from @xmath25 to @xmath26 at an average a - site ionic radius @xmath27 is in full agreement with earlier reports@xcite .",
    "for @xmath28 , with @xmath29  , it was necessary to include a mixture of the rhombohedral and the orthorhombic structures in the refinements .",
    "+ low field ac - susceptibility measurements , @xmath30 , were performed in a lakeshore ac - susceptometer .",
    "measurements of resistivity and magnetoresistance were performed using a maglab 2000 system from oxford instruments ; the magnetoresistance is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "finally , time dependent zfc magnetisation measurements were performed in a non - commercial squid magnetometer @xcite .",
    "the sample was cooled in zero field from a temperature above @xmath5 to the measurement temperature . after a waiting time ( @xmath32 ) ,",
    "a weak magnetic field ( @xmath33=0.05 to 1 oe ) was applied and the magnetisation @xmath34 recorded vs. observation time @xmath35 .",
    "the relaxation rate , defined as @xmath36 d@xmath37/dlog @xmath35 , was derived from these measurements .",
    "the main frame of fig .  [ fig1 ] shows @xmath38 and @xmath39 vs. temperature for the @xmath6 = 0 and @xmath6 = 0.4 samples . the curie temperature ( @xmath5 ) , defined from the inflection point in @xmath38 decreases with increasing nd doping . at the same time ,",
    "a frequency dependent knee is created in the in - phase component of the ac - susceptibility at a temperature @xmath40 , corresponding to a large and likewise frequency dependent peak in the out - of - phase component ; @xmath41 decreases with increasing nd doping .",
    "this more pronounced frequency dependence of @xmath42 indicates that the magnetic state is more disordered at low temperatures .",
    "the magnetic disorder is a consequence of changes in the crystal structure induced by replacing la@xmath9 with nd@xmath9 .",
    "the smaller @xmath19 bond angle ( cf . table [ table1 ] ) will affect ( decrease ) not only the de hopping integral between @xmath43(mn)-2@xmath44(o)-@xmath43(mn ) orbitals but also the afm superexchange hopping integral between @xmath14(mn)-2@xmath45(o)-@xmath14(mn ) orbitals .",
    "however , due to the nature of the dp@xmath46 hybridization , the afm interaction is expected to be less influenced by changes in bond angle and will thus , relative to the fm de interaction , increase in importance . the strong effect on the de interaction",
    "is confirmed by the variation of the ferromagnetic transition temperature with bond angle presented in the insert of fig .",
    "in passing we note that disorder in the magnetic interactions may lead to one of several possible , distinctly different magnetic states ; a spin canted state @xcite , a state with electronic phase separation between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions @xcite , or a rsg state @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that these possible magnetic states are expected to display quite different magnetic and electrical behaviors , something which will discussed more in detail below .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) presents the zero - field resistivity vs. temperature for all samples . a metal - insulator ( m - i ) transition occurs for nd dopings @xmath47 and @xmath28 at a temperature close to @xmath5 . as the nd doping further increases the resistivity increases and no clear m -",
    "i transition is observed ; the resistivity at low temperatures increases with decreasing temperature . by application of a large magnetic field , the spin disorder scattering induced by competing fm and afm interactions",
    "is removed , creating a new magnetoresistance peak at a temperature lower than the first near-@xmath5 peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ) ; for @xmath6=0.4 , this second peak is larger in magnitude than the first one .",
    "the second peak in the magnetoresistance appears at a temperature close to @xmath41 , suggesting a correlation between these different experimental observations .",
    "this is confirmed re - measuring @xmath48 with a superimposed dc field , as shown in fig .",
    "the dissipation is strongly suppressed by the dc field ; at @xmath49=@xmath50 oe , the frequency dependent ( cf .",
    "insert of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) peaks in @xmath48 are still observed , shifted slightly to lower temperature , while at @xmath49=@xmath51 oe , the dissipation is very weak and the rsg like features are no longer observed .",
    "this indicates that , since the second peak in the magnetoresistance at @xmath52 continues to develop increasing the field further ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ) , weak magnetic disorder remains , in the sense that the spin system is not fully collinear even after suppressing the slow spin dynamics of the rsg phase . + the frequency dependence of the ac - susceptibility and the absence of a m - i transition for larger nd dopings suggest that the ferromagnetic spin arrangement and the electronic configuration are perturbed .",
    "a transition from a fm metallic to an afm partially charge ordered state with electronic phase separation of antiferro- and ferromagnetically ordered regions will result in a sharp decrease of @xmath53 at the transition temperature as well as a likewise sharp increase of the resistivity@xcite .",
    "moreover , in partially charge ordered systems , application of a magnetic field drastically modifies the transport behavior ; a relatively modest magnetic field will turn the insulating state to a metallic state@xcite .",
    "these characteristics are not observed in the presently investigated manganite system . +",
    "another explanation for the observed spin - disorder is that a spin glass phase appears at low temperatures .",
    "one actually refers to a reentrant spin glass phase since the disordered magnetic phase appears at temperatures below where an ordered ( ferromagnetic ) phase first appears .",
    "this kind of samples have been extensively studied in the past , and it has been shown that rsg samples exhibit similar relaxation properties as conventional spin glasses@xcite .",
    "in particular , the time dependence of the zfc magnetisation depends on the time @xmath32 used to equilibrate the spin system before applying a magnetic field .",
    "this dependence is revealed by an inflection point in the @xmath34 vs. log ( @xmath35 ) curve , corresponding to a maximum in the relaxation rate @xmath54 curve , at an observation time close to the waiting time @xmath55 .",
    "the phenomenon is called ageing , and is an inherent property of disordered and frustrated spin systems , while this property is not expected to be part of the spin canted phase originally described by de gennes @xcite . + time",
    "dependent zfc magnetisation measurements have been performed for the sample @xmath6=0.4 to study the behavior of the magnetic relaxation at temperatures both below and above the temperature where the disordered magnetic state appears .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) shows the relaxation rate @xmath54 for @xmath56k ( below @xmath41 ) and @xmath57k ( above @xmath41 ) , for different magnetic fields . the sample displays clear ageing behavior at both temperatures , with a waiting time dependence similar to that observed for ordinary spin glasses @xcite as shown in the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , explicitly proving the rsg nature of the low temperature transition .",
    "the magnitude of the observed ageing phenomenon as well as the magnitude of the peak in @xmath58 prove the effect to be intrinsic to the material rather than confined to a possible spin disorder at grain boundaries .",
    "also , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) the relaxation rate for @xmath56k indicates linear response of the magnetisation up to ( relatively ) high fields in the rsg phase . in the ferromagnetic phase",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( b ) ) , the response is non - linear even in weak magnetic fields and the ageing phenomenon is gradually suppressed when increasing the magnetic field , as it has also been observed in conventional reentrant spin glass materials @xcite .",
    "the resistivity of the la@xmath0nd@xmath1k@xmath2mno@xmath3 system increases with increasing @xmath6 while the curie temperature decreases , both observations indicating a lesser degree of fm double exchange interaction in favor of afm superexchange interaction .",
    "the competition between fm and afm exchange interactions results in spin disorder and frequency dependent characteristics of the ac - susceptibility ; a frequency dependent peak in @xmath59 is observed at a temperature @xmath40 .",
    "the spin disorder is also evidenced by a second magnetoresistance peak at a temperature close to @xmath41 .",
    "time dependent zfc magnetisation measurements show ageing phenomena , both below and above @xmath41 , revealing the identity of the low temperature disordered magnetic state to be a reentrant spin glass phase .",
    "these results show the significance of the afm superexchange interaction between localized @xmath14(mn ) moments and how by substitution of cations it is possible to control its magnitude relative to the magnitude of the ferromagnetic de interaction .",
