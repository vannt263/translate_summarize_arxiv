    "<S> this system has recently been investigated @xcite and a strong dependence of the convergence of the dmrg from the initial basis was observed . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the molecule in a stretched geometry with an interatomic distance of 3.3 . </S>",
    "<S> as initial bases we use the hartree - fock ( hf ) basis of the system and a localised basis derived from the hf orbitals by a foster - boys localisation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such localised orbitals are widely used in qc - dmrg calculations and are known to yield a better convergence for the be ring @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> starting from the according initial basis we iteratively apply the following scheme : we run the standard qc - dmrg for 2 sweeps , perform 8 additional sweeps together with the local mode transformation as described in table [ tbl : algorithm ] and reorder the basis according to its mutual information patterns @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hereby we either fix the truncation error @xmath111 made in each step or set a hard - cut on @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our calculations are show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] . in the left panel of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : results ] we show how the bond dimension behaves for a ground state search with a bounded truncation error @xmath105 and @xmath106 for a calculation in the hf basis and optimised bases obtained by the above scheme starting from the hf orbitals .    </S>",
    "<S> it is key to the method proposed that the optimisation of the basis leads to a significant decrease of needed resources already in the first iteration , where after the tenth iterations of basis optimisation the needed bond dimension is more than one order of magnitude smaller than in the unoptimised orbitals . for realistic applications of the scheme intermediate high bond dimensions during the calculation </S>",
    "<S> need to be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : results ] shows the relative error in energy reached when performing a calculation with @xmath108 starting in the hf and localised basis . as noted before the localised basis allows for a more efficient approximation of the ground state than the hf basis . </S>",
    "<S> the basis optimisation allows us to further significantly optimise both the hf and the localised basis . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the hf orbitals we obtain a basis for which the relative error in energy drops by one order of magnitude from @xmath112 to @xmath113 . beginning at the localised basis allows us to reduce the relative error in energy from @xmath114 to @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the energy in the optimised basis starting from the hf orbitals is slightly worse than the energy obtained in the localised orbitals , reflecting the fact that finding the optimal basis is a hard global optimisation problem .    </S>",
    "<S> we have repeated similar calculations for different configurations of the be ring ; at the equilibrium configuration and close to the avoided crossing . in each case </S>",
    "<S> we have been able to find a physical basis allowing for a more efficient approximation of the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates that the above scheme can significantly and efficiently optimise a given initial basis . </S>",
    "<S> as the local mode transformation can be added with no increase of the computational cost to an existing two - site dmrg and typically yield already in the first iteration of the basis optimisation a significant improvement of the basis our scheme extends the standard qc two - site dmrg .    _ conclusion and perspectives . </S>",
    "<S> _ in this work , we have presented a scheme that adapts the physical basis an mps is formulated in by applying gaussian transformations . incorporating local gaussian transformations into the two - site dmrg algorithm allows us to optimise both the basis and the mps iteratively . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting algorithm successfully optimises the physical basis such that distinctly better approximations of the ground state of a given system by an mps can be identified </S>",
    "<S> .    it should be manifest from the description of the method that the same idea is equally applicable to other tensor networks , due to the locality of the transformations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , _ tree - tensor network _ approaches @xcite can readily be combined with the methods laid out here . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , they are expected to be helpful for 2-d lattice systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the above scheme can be directly combined with recent developments for the time - evolution of mps @xcite in order to obtain a time - evolution with variational physical basis .    </S>",
    "<S> our general strategy  of combining tensor networks with fermionic transformations  complements the recent interesting approach of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is similar in mindset , but where these two components are put together in the opposite order . there </S>",
    "<S> , a matrix - product operator is applied onto a free fermionic wave function . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to that approach , we here retain efficient contractibility , however . the approach taken in this work </S>",
    "<S> can also be seen as a variational principle that allows to find the optimal _ fermionic tensor network _ in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a fixed fermionic basis change is being made use of . widening the scope , these tools seem also helpful in related approaches making use of a _ big data _ machinery to capture strongly correlated quantum systems . for example , _ compressed sensing ideas _ can help finding localised wannier functions @xcite , which in turn can be made use of in density functional theory @xcite . in conjunction with the tools developed here , a combined approach close to optimally representing fermionic correlated states seems within reach .    </S>",
