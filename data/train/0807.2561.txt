    "sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  compounds are a part of the larger family @xmath8cu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( @xmath9 = sr , ca , la , y ,  ) which are considered as quasi - one - dimensional ( q-1d ) copper oxides due to their pronounced anisotropy . they have been investigated intensively during the last years because of their fascinating physical properties,@xcite their close relation to cuprate superconductors@xcite and especially after the superconductivity was achieved under high pressure in a material heavily doped with ca.@xcite    the incommensurate crystal structures of these compounds consist of planes of quasi - one dimensional cuo@xmath10 chains stacked alternately with planes of two - leg cu@xmath10o@xmath11 ladders.@xcite the orientation of these chains and ladders defines the crystallographical @xmath12 axis and are alternately stacked along the @xmath13 axis separated by layers of sr(ca ) .",
    "chain and ladder spin subsystems in sr@xmath14cu@xmath2o@xmath3  interact weakly along the @xmath15 axis .",
    "consequently , the resistivity shows remarkable anisotropy , indicative of a quasi one - dimensional electronic state.@xcite materials with different sr / ca composition are isostructural with only minor modifications of the bond lengths and angles.@xcite all cuprate superconductors found up to now contain square cuo@xmath10 planes , whereas sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  is the only known superconducting copper oxide without a square lattice .",
    "an important feature of the superconductivity in sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  is that it occurs by carrier doping in the low - dimensional antiferromagnetic spin system .",
    "this feature is common to the cuo@xmath10 plane .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the electronic structure upon hole doping is one of the key issues for understanding superconductivity .",
    "sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  is intrinsically hole doped due to stoichiometric reasons . in order for the formula unit to remain electrically neutral",
    ", the average copper valency must be @xmath16 instead of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , there is one hole per four cu ions , or 6 per f.u .",
    "there are four formula units per approximate super - structure cell , implying a hole density of @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "the often accepted doped hole density refers to 1 hole for every 14 cu s in the ladder and 5 holes for every 10 cu s in the chain ( that are localized ) .",
    "the madelung potential calculations@xcite have shown that for the @xmath20 compound holes are staying essentially in the chains where their localization leads to an insulating behavior . upon ca substitution , which does not change the total hole count ,",
    "holes are transferred from the chains to the ladders and the longitudinal conductivity ( along the @xmath12 axis ) increases , leading to q-1d metallic properties .",
    "this hole transfer can be caused by the reduction of the distance between chains and ( sr , ca ) layers , which results in an enhancement of the electrostatic potentials in the chains .",
    "the redistribution of the holes among chains and ladders ( depending on the ca content ) is one of the most important factors which controls the physical properties ( in particular superconductivity ) of these spin - ladders .",
    "however , experimentally , the precise amount of hole transfer is still under discussion , since different experimental techniques have provided contradictory results .    from the optical data ,",
    "et al._@xcite concluded that there is one hole per f.u .  in the ladders for @xmath20 , and 2.8 for @xmath21 .",
    "polarization - dependent near - edge x - ray - absorption fine structure ( nexafs ) , as the technique which can probe the hole distribution between chains and ladders most directly , shows a much smaller hole transfer from the chains into the ladders induced by ca - substitution.@xcite the results predict that 0.8 holes per f.u .  are found in the ladders for @xmath7 and 1.1 for the @xmath22 compound . also , gotoh et al.@xcite performed an x - ray diffraction study on sr@xmath14cu@xmath2o@xmath3crystals . the bond - valence sum calculation based on their data",
    "has indicated that only 0.5 holes per f.u .",
    "reside in the ladders for the @xmath20 compound .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) spectroscopy measurements were also performed on these compounds with different results.@xcite recently piskunov et al.@xcite reported results of a @xmath23cu and @xmath24o study on sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  for @xmath7 and @xmath25 .",
    "they have found that the change in hole number is @xmath26 holes per formula unit in the ladder , which is in a good agreement with nexafs results .",
    "they also reported that the hole distribution changes with temperature and pressure , concluding that the decrease in temperature reduces the hole number in the ladders by transferring them partly back to the chains , while pressure seems to induce an additional transfer of holes to the ladders .",
    "more recently , the distribution of holes in sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  was revisited with semi - empirical re - analysis of the x - ray absorption.@xcite this interpretation of the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) data lead to much larger ladder hole densities than previously suggested ; i.e. , it was concluded that there are 2.8 hole per f.u .  in the ladders for @xmath20 , and 4.4 for @xmath21 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to contribute to the undoubtedly still open question about the amount of holes that participate in the dc transport in sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  for @xmath4 , by studying the temperature dependence of the hall coefficient  the long missing basic experiment . in our work",
    ", we emphasize the temperature region around room temperature where the obtained estimate for the effective number of carriers could be compared with the results obtained by different experimental methods .",
    "the sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  ( @xmath27 ) samples used in the present work were single crystals , made from calcined sintered polycrystalline rods by the floating zone recrystallization method .",
    "samples were @xmath28 mm long and had a cross - section of @xmath29mm@xmath30 .",
    "the resistivity and hall - effect data , that will be presented here , are for @xmath31  and @xmath32  axes .",
    "the @xmath32  direction is the highest conductivity direction ( along ladders and chains ) , the @xmath31direction with intermediate conductivity is perpendicular to @xmath32 in the @xmath31-@xmath32  ladder plane , while the @xmath33  direction ( with the lowest conductivity ) is perpendicular to the @xmath31-@xmath32  plane . for the @xmath32  and @xmath31  axes resistivity measurements , the samples have been cut from a long single crystal along the @xmath32  and @xmath31  axes .",
    "electrical contacts to the sample ( three pairs of hall contacts and one pair of current contacts on the sides of the crystal ) were obtained by using a special dupont 6838 silver paste .",
    "the paste was first applied directly to the surface and heated for 1 h at 450@xmath34c in oxygen flow atmosphere , and then the 30@xmath35 m gold wires were pasted to the baked contact areas of the sample .",
    "the measurements were conducted in the temperature range @xmath36 . due to the semiconducting nature of the samples , the electrical resistances varied from @xmath37  @xmath38 to @xmath39  m@xmath38 ; depending on the resistance , either ac or dc techniques were used for the measurements . for resistivity measurements two pairs of voltage contacts on each side of the sample were used",
    ".    the hall effect was measured in 5 and 9 t magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic field was always along the @xmath33  direction ( @xmath40geometry ) .",
    "for all the samples ( @xmath27 ) the current was @xmath41 , whereas for @xmath7 and @xmath6 , hall data were also taken for current along the @xmath32  direction ( this enabled us to check the possible anisotropy in the hall effect ) .",
    "the latter geometry would have been a preferred choice , but for some samples , on our disposal , it was not eligible ( for accurate hall effect measurements ) to measure in that geometry due to unnested voltages greater than 20% ( which are an indication of inhomogeneous current flow ) . to decrease the inhomogeneous current flow",
    "a mechanical removing ( by using the emery paper ) of the surface layer is important and was performed whenever it was possible for our samples .",
    "particular care was taken to ensure the temperature stabilization .",
    "the hall voltage was measured at fixed temperatures for all three pairs of hall contacts to test and/or control the homogenous current distribution through the sample and in field sweeps from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in order to eliminate the possible mixing of magnetoresistive components ( due to the misalignment of the opposite hall contacts ) .",
    "also , two contacts along one side of the sample could be used as a pair of voltage contacts to compensate ( at zero field ) the hall signal , eliminating in that way the magnetoresistive component directly from the measured data and thus increasing the accuracy of the hall signal measurements . as it will be shown later ,",

    "as it was already shown,@xcite the dc resistivity for @xmath6 exhibits a different behavior than all other @xmath82 compounds : although at low temperatures , below @xmath83  k , the resistivity @xmath79 increases ( as it does for @xmath41direction , indicating a carrier localization ) , a metallic behavior is seen above 80 k. in other words , the @xmath53 dependence of @xmath78 ( which is anomalous in the sense that @xmath84 , i.e. semiconducting , in the temperature range where @xmath85 , i.e. metallic ) , indicates a non - coherent transport along the @xmath31  axis ( along the rungs of the ladders ) .",
    "moreover , an insulator - to - superconductor transition was observed at @xmath86  gpa , accompanied by incoherent to coherent crossover of the transverse ( interladder , @xmath31  axis ) charge transport ; i.e. @xmath79 and @xmath78 have shown quite similar metallic temperature dependences , which indicates that both are subject to the same scattering mechanism.@xcite the application of pressure therefore triggers a dimensional crossover in the charge dynamics from one to two , and the superconductivity in this ladder compound might be a phenomenon in a 2d anisotropic electronic system .",
    "such findings indicate that , at ambient pressure , charge dynamics is essentially one dimensional ( 1d ) and carriers are confined within each ladder .",
    "the phenomenon of interlayer or interchain decoherence in anisotropic metals is still poorly understood . in strictly 1d systems all electronic states",
    "are known to be localized at @xmath87 in the presence of weak disorder , whereas in real materials with finite interchain coupling @xmath88 , the situation is different .",
    "a considerable theoretical work has been devoted to this subject.@xcite recently , in accord with prigodin and firsovs@xcite argumentation , that impurity scattering rates @xmath89 render the system effectively 1d and therefore susceptible to localization at low @xmath53 , the influence of introduced disorder on anisotropic resistivity of prba@xmath10cu@xmath90o@xmath91 was analyzed and interpreted as a consequence of localization effects that are observed for extremely small amounts of disorder.@xcite in other words , once the intrachain scattering rate surpasses the interchain hopping rate , the coherent interchain tunneling is suppressed , the system is rendered effectively 1d and localization sets in .",
    "we believe that this finding shows qualitative agreement with our @xmath54 data for @xmath6 ( the metallic - like behavior in one direction only ) . in sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3",
    "an incommensurability between the chains and ladders creates distortions , which lead to additional modulations of the crystallographic positions that are intrinsic sources of disorder .",
    "moreover , there is an additional disorder introduced by ca - substitution.@xcite accordingly , the difference in the @xmath92 and @xmath93 behavior of @xmath6 compound may be attributed to intrinsic disorder while the appearance of a metallic behavior for @xmath93 under pressure,@xcite indicates that the interladder coupling starts to prevail over one - dimensional effects , which dominate the charge transport at ambient pressure .",

    "the @xmath128  plane in high-@xmath121 is almost isotropic , with metallic - like resistivities for both perpendicular directions . on the other hand , for sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  and @xmath6 the anisotropy ratio @xmath81 is around 13 at room temperature and becomes enhanced at lower temperatures reaching about 55 at 140k ( due to metallic - like @xmath92 and non - metallic like @xmath93 variations )",
    "this leads to the interesting conclusion : the well known @xmath124 dependence of the inverse hall angle , which seems to be largely doping independent in cuprates@xcite is not changed by the increased anisotropy in the ladder plane .",
    "further investigations comprising pressure dependence of @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 for different pressures ( up to the pressures when superconductivity occurs ) and different @xmath59 may give more information about the normal state properties of sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  and could be an important step towards a correct microscopic theory of cuprate superconductivity .",
    "in summary , we have reported measurements of the hall coefficient @xmath94 at ambient pressure of the quasi - one dimensional cuprate sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  for @xmath27 . it is known that isovalent ca - substitution does not change the total hole count , but causes additional transfer of holes from the chains ( where they are localized ) into the ladders ( where they are rather mobile ) , but as far as the amount of transferred holes is concerned , the experiments which have been performed up to now , have given contradictory results .",
    "our findings give a positive , holelike , hall coefficient which is temperature dependent for all samples . for @xmath95",
    "the hall coefficient is activated , and the activation energy agrees well with that obtained from the resistivity data .",
    "the observed behavior is that of a conventional @xmath97-type semiconductor . for @xmath6 @xmath92 and @xmath94 follow different temperature dependences : above 140k @xmath92 increases linearly with temperature , while the hall coefficient is inversely proportional to @xmath53 , giving an overall @xmath124 dependence of the inverse hall angle @xmath125 for @xmath129",
    ". such behavior , which is well known and typical for high temperature copper - oxide superconductors , seems independent of the pronounced anisotropy in the cu@xmath10o@xmath11 ladder plane .",
    "a comparison of our estimate for the effective number of carriers @xmath130 for sr@xmath0ca@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3  ( @xmath27 ) at 300k with the numbers of holes in ladders ( obtained by different experimental techniques ) shows good agreement with nexafs and nmr results and indicates that @xmath101 corresponds to the holes in the ladders that participate in dc transport .",
    "the difference @xmath131 ( this value could be even lower due to , probably underestimated , @xmath101 for @xmath7 ) leads us to conclude that a minor change in number of carriers on the ladders is responsible for a pronounced change in resistivity with ca substitution ."
