    "the small magellanic cloud ( hereafter smc ) is , together with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) the nearest dwarf irregular galaxy to our own , and provides an invaluable laboratory to study star formation and chemical evolution in low mass galaxies .",
    "there is recent evidence that the lmc and smc are on their first pass around the milky way and that the smc may not be bound to the lmc @xcite .",
    "the smc may be a rare example of a comparatively isolated dwarf galaxy and possibly even a surviving fragment from the era of reionization .",
    "however , the smc has also been interacting with the lmc during the past few gyrs and these interactions have modulated the recent star formation history of both galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the smc is best modelled as an old dwarf spheroidal galaxy possessing a gaseous disk @xcite that has been distorted by star formation and tidal stresses , giving the galaxy its present irregular appearance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution and chemical abundances of field stars in the smc thus provide clues to its star formation history .",
    "open questions include : whether there is an ` edge ' to the smc , the metallicity distribution of its field stars , the presence of a metal abundance gradient and whether a metal - poor halo exists around the smc or other dwarf galaxies as it does around the milky way and other giants .",
    "stars belonging to the smc have been found along the magellanic bridge ; an old and intermediate age population out to 5@xmath6 but only a young population at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored three fields to the south of the smc identified smc stellar sequences belonging to the intermediate age population out to 6.5 kpc from the smc centre .",
    "in other galaxies , @xcite observed lmc stars as far as 23@xmath6 from its centre . extended stellar envelopes",
    "are also detected around other dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite , but at least in some cases , these are actually tidal in origin @xcite .",
    "although stars are proved to exist at large projected distances in many nearby dwarfs , these objects may not represent a classical metal - poor halo as is encountered in the milky way or m31 .",
    "for instance , in the lmc stars studied by @xcite , the metallicity distribution is broad and centred around [ fe / h ] @xmath8 , with a large range of ages @xcite , unlike the largely old and metal - poor stars that are believed to populate the outer halos of giant galaxies .",
    "the smc itself appears to have formed stars quickly at early epochs reaching a metallicity of @xmath8 and to have then suffered a series of star formation episodes over the past 3 gyrs , after a period of quiescence , which have produced younger stellar populations and more metal rich stars @xcite .    in the innermost regions of the smc",
    ", @xcite found an average metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath8 , in agreement with previous studies , but also claimed to have detected a metal abundance gradient ( richer inward ) , arguing that this is related to an age gradient , with younger ( and more metal rich ) stars towards the smc centre . while this agrees with the earlier work of @xcite , the study of smc clusters and field giants ( in the proximity of clusters ) by @xcite , as well as the work by @xcite on the c / m ratio of agb stars in the smc , do not support the existence of the metal abundance gradient claimed by @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we report on a pilot program for an extensive radial velocity and calcium triplet survey of the smc , based on data collected during a similar survey of the galactic bulge .",
    "the observations and data reductions are described in the next section , while we present the main results and our discussion in the following sections .",
    "we adopt the most recent distance modulus of 18.79 for the smc @xcite .",
    "data for this project were obtained as part of the bulge radial velocity assay ( brava  @xcite ) . the brava survey was allocated a series of runs between august 2008 and august 2009 to carry out radial velocity measurements of @xmath9 m giants in the bulge of the milky way .",
    "the allocated times were somewhat sub - optimal for bulge observations and left about 1/3 of each night free , after the bulge sank to high airmass at about 02:30 .",
    "we decided to dedicate this remaining time to an exploratory survey to study the kinematics and chemical abundances of k giants in the smc .",
    "observations were taken at the v. m. blanco 4 m telescope on cerro tololo , chile , using the hydra multi - fiber spectrograph .",
    "we used the kpgld grating ( 790 l / mm , blazed at 8500  ) , with the 200 @xmath10 m slit mask to achieve a resolution of 4200 , covering a spectral range of 1800   centred on 7900  , including the three calcium triplet ( cat ) lines at 8498 , 8542 and 8662  .",
    "further details on the survey may be found in the brava paper by @xcite .",
    "exposure times for each target were 3 @xmath11 seconds .",
    "targets were selected from the 2mass database @xcite as luminous red giants at the distance of the smc , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the selection range and method are analogous to those used for the galactic bulge brava survey .",
    "figure 1 shows our targets overplotted over the padova isochrones @xcite shifted to the assumed smc distance .",
    "table 1 shows , in column order , the identification of the fields , their positions of the fields ( equinox 2000 ) , their distances from the smc centre ( in kpc , assuming the above distance modulus ) , the number of stars we attribute to the smc ( see below for the definition of the velocity range we considered ) , the number of stars with successful redshifts we obtain and the total number of stars surveyed .",
    "figure 2 plots the positions of the fields on the sky with respect to the smc ( using 2mass data ) .",
    "we have one field at each of the four cardinal points , at projected distances of 0.9 and 1.9 kpc , and two fields to the east of the smc , at distances of 3.9 and 5.1 kpc .",

    "at this point we rejected cosmic rays with the laplacian edge algorithm @xcite .",
    "we then extracted the spectra using the specialized iraf package dohydra and finally combined all the individual spectra for each star using the scombine task .",
    "we derived radial velocities by cross - correlating our data with spectral templates @xcite focusing on the region containing the cat lines .",
    "we then measured the cat index @xcite for our stars using the _ indexf _ program @xcite and converted our measurements to [ fe / h ] using the fitting functions tabulated in @xcite , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 from the padova isochrones @xcite .",
    "our stars are actually comparatively faint , with @xmath21 of 16 to 17 , plus we often observed after moonrise , so our errors are relatively large : @xmath22 km s@xmath2 in radial velocity and @xmath23 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "in figure 3 we show radial velocity histograms for all fields ( as marked in the figure legend ) and a comparison with expectations from the besancon model of the galaxy @xcite , assuming the same selection criteria as our smc fields and over the @xmath24 field of view sampled by hydra .",
    "we assume that all stars with heliocentric radial velocity greater than 100 km s@xmath2 can be attributed to the smc , as implied by the distribution of velocities in the besancon model ( figure 3 ) . in the northern 0.9 kpc field ,",
    "the stars follow a gaussian distribution with @xmath25 km s@xmath2 , while the south 0.9 kpc field has @xmath26 km s@xmath2 .",
    "these values are broadly consistent with previous measurements as tabulated by @xcite .",
    "however our east 0.9 kpc field shows a bimodal distribution . the kmm algorithm @xcite returns two peaks at 162 and 205 km s@xmath2 with 72% significance",
    ". in the western 0.9 kpc field there also appears to be a bimodal distribution , with peaks at 143 and 180 km s@xmath2 but at much lower significance .",
    "the lower velocity peak is consistent with the conventional smc recession velocity , while the other peak may correspond to a high velocity component , detected in hi observations @xcite .",
    "for the 1.9 kpc fields , the northern field has @xmath27 km s@xmath2 , while for the southern field the distribution appears to be bimodal with peaks at 156 and 206 km s@xmath2 with a 75% significance according to the kmm algorithm . as for the 0.9 kpc field , the eastern field also appears to show a bimodal velocity distribution , with peaks at 162 and 211 km s@xmath2 at a 58% significance level .",
    "the western field is instead consistent with a single component with @xmath28 km s@xmath2 . in all these cases",
    "we recover the ` typical ' smc velocity dispersion of about 25 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we also observed two fields to the east , at a distance of 3.9 and 5.1 kpc from the smc centre .",
    "the smc is clearly present in the 3.9 kpc field .",
    "this has a pronounced bimodal velocity distribution , with peaks at 106 and 211 km s@xmath2 .",
    "while the high velocity component is at approximately the same radial velocity in all eastern fields , and in the southern field as well , the velocity separation with the lower velocity component appears to increase significantly outwards from the smc centre .    on the other hand",
    ", the smc contribution is very small to non - existent in the most distant field to the east .",
    "this suggests that the edge of the smc in this direction is close to this field .",
    "to estimate this , we first calculated the number of smc stars in each of our eastern fields based on the derived completeness and fraction of stars we attribute to the smc in table 1 .",
    "we then integrated a 10 gyr old , [ fe / h]=@xmath29 luminosity function from @xcite and derived the surface brightness of smc stars in our fields , after correcting for incompleteness and sampling .",
    "we then fit this to a hernquist profile and extrapolated to a surface brightness of 26 mag arcsec@xmath30 in @xmath31 , which we take , arbitrarily , as the smc ` limit ' .",
    "this exercise returns a distance of 5.8 kpc , unlike what observed by @xcite along the magellanic bridge , and the detection of smc stars out to about 6.5 kpc to the south of the smc by @xcite .",
    "these latter stars may of course have been formed and/or tidally displaced from the smc by the repeated interactions with the lmc .",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution of metal abundances , from the calcium triplet , in the 8 inner fields . at a projected distance of 0.9 kpc from the smc centre ,",
    "both the east and west fields show broad metallicity distributions centered at [ fe / h]=@xmath32 with a dispersion of @xmath33 and @xmath34 with a dispersion of @xmath35 respectively , consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "the metallicity distribution for the 0.9 kpc field to the north instead appears to exhibit a peak at about [ fe / h ] @xmath36 and another at [ fe / h ] @xmath5 , while in the south the metallicity distribution is also broad and extending to solar or slightly supersolar metal abundances .",
    "the metallicity distributions are also similar in the four 1.9 kpc fields , but the higher metallicity stars in the north and south fields are no longer present .",
    "all these fields have [ fe / h ] @xmath37 with a dispersion of about @xmath38 .",
    "while we do not see a radial abundance trend , as claimed by @xcite the disappearance of the higher metallicity stars in the outer northern and southern fields , with respect to the inner fields , may explain the discrepancy between the claim of @xcite for a metal abundance gradients and the results of @xcite and @xcite . while the majority of the smc stars follow a broad metallicity distribution with no radial trend , some of the inner fields contain a more metal rich , and presumably younger , population .",
    "this would mimic a metal abundance gradient if the bimodality of the distribution is not taken into account .",
    "the data we present here show that , while the smc is detected to large distances ( about 6 kpc ) along the magellanic bridge @xcite and to the south @xcite , we appear to have approached the edge of the smc in our easternmost fields .",
    "we estimate that the smc ` edge ' in this direction lies at about 6 kpc from its centre .",
    "the shape of the smc has however been tidally distorted by interactions with the lmc and it has been elongated along the n - s direction @xcite .",
    "exploration of the radial and azimuthal behavior at larger distances will be one of the outcomes expected from a wider - field spectroscopic survey .",
    "the kinematics of stars in our fields is complex .",
    "there is evidence for the presence of two components in some fields , particularly to the east and the south , i.e. the regions most affected by interactions with the lmc and the magellanic bridge : a low velocity one around 160 km s@xmath2 and a high velocity component at about 210 km s@xmath2 .",
    "although the evidence is weak , while the high velocity component is at the same position in our 3.9kpc field to the east , the low velocity component appears to have lower velocity .",
    "this is reminiscent of the claims for multiple peaks in the hi velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "similar bifurcations are also observed in tidal streams .",
    "the hi features are often attributed to multiple and overlapping gas shells , but their presence in the stellar distributions , especially in the zones to the east and south closer to the magellanic bridge , may favor multiple components models such as those of @xcite .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that we are detecting stars from the lmc in the smc eastern fields : @xcite find the presence of lmc stars as far 23@xmath6 from the lmc centre ( which of course lies to the east of the smc ) , while @xcite has argued for the existence of a common halo encompassing the lmc and smc .",
    "based on the recent study of lmc kinematics by @xcite , we would expect lmc stars to lie at the position of the second velocity peak we observe in the eastern fields .",
    "this seems somewhat less likely because we find that the secondary peaks in our data contain about the same number of stars as the primary velocity peaks , and therefore appear more likely to be associated with the smc velocity structure than the lmc .",
    "since our easternmost fields are closer to the lmc than the 0.9 kpc eastern field , we would expect the lmc contribution ( if it causes the secondary peak ) to increase ` outward ' from the smc , unlike the observations .",
    "it is of course very likely that some lmc stars are actually superposed over the smc , but they can probably be securely separated out only by chemical tagging .",
    "one striking feature we observe in our data is a broad metallicity distribution centered on [ fe / h ] @xmath39 , extending from @xmath4 to solar or even slightly supersolar values .",
    "this is very similar to what observed in the lmc by @xcite and in sagittarius by @xcite and may suggest a very similar chemical evolution pattern in most dwarf galaxies .",
    "in fact the abundance distribution we observe in the smc is also very similar to that measured for the m31 `` giant stream '' population , with a peak near [ fe / h ] @xmath8 and tails to high and low metallicities @xcite . the ingestion of massive galaxies such as the smc has been invoked to explain the wide metallicity distribution and the presence of metal - rich stars in the m31 halo ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in the case of the smc",
    "there is the question of how a galaxy massive enough to host such metal - rich stars could have been accreted by the smc without more significant disruption of the smc ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the broad metallicity distribution may instead imply the presence of multiple stellar generations .",
    "it is known that the smc has undergone recent star formation , possibly induced by encounters with the lmc , after a long period of quiescence @xcite .",
    "@xcite claim that there is a metal abundance gradient in the smc and suggest that this is due to the presence of younger stars in the centre of this galaxy .",
    "we find that the main population of the smc does not exhibit a metal abundance gradient @xcite , but that in the inner fields to the north and south there is a contribution from more metal - rich stars , with peak metallicity around [ fe / h ] @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite find evidence for an intermediate age population in their fields to the south out to 6.5 kpc , while a younger stellar population is detected by @xcite along the magellanic bridge .",
    "the presence of more metal - rich stars forming a separate peak in the inner fields resembles the picture of @xcite where a recent burst of star formation has led to self - enrichment in the inner regions .",
    "the approximate north - south trend is roughly in the directions of the bridge and stream features and it is tempting to speculate that the interactions that created these gaseous features are also responsible for the star formation episodes .",
    "a wider and larger spectroscopic survey will allow us to clarify the structure and kinematics of the smc , explore the existence of metallicity gradients , search for a metal poor halo and detect the presence of streams .",
