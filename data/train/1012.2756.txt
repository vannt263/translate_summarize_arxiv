    "at the begining of 21 century , the standard cosmological model ( scm ) has become the dominant model of the universe , replacing the hot model of the universe ( big bang ) .",
    "scm is based on two important observational results : accelerated expansion of the universe and the euclidean spatial geometry . in addition",
    ", it is assumed that the early universe is adequately described by the theory of inflation .",
    "scm fixes a number of parameters of the universe and , in particular , its energy structure . according to the scm",
    "the universe is currently dominated by dark energy ( in the form of a cosmological constant @xmath0 ) , required to explain the accelerated expansion and dark ( non - baryonic ) matter ( dm ) .",
    "existence of dm gives a possibility to solve a number of contradictions in the big bang model ( non - decreasing behavior of rotation curves , the structure of galactic halo , a chronology of the structures formation , etc . ) .",
    "attributing the acceleration of the universe expansion exclusively to the negative pressure generated by the cosmological constant drastically reduced the possibilities of the scale factor dynamics and condemned the universe to eternal accelerated expansion .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of the scale factor in scm is described by friedmann equations @xmath1\\ ] ] the solution of this equation reads    @xmath2^{2/3 } ,   \\\\",
    "a\\left ( { t \\ll h_0^ { - 1 } } \\right ) \\propto t^{2/3 } ; \\;a\\left ( { t \\gg h_0^{-1 } } \\right ) \\propto e^{h_0 t }",
    ". \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we see that the asymptotic behavior of the solution described the era of matter domination in the early universe @xmath3 and dark energy domination for the later evolution @xmath4 .",
    "we now find the dependence of the deceleration parameter @xmath5 on the redshift @xmath6 for a universe filled with arbitrary components of the state equation @xmath7 . in this case , @xmath8 for the scm , this expression takes the form ( see figure 1 ) @xmath9 in particular , at the present time    @xmath10    a characteristic feature of the dependence @xmath11 - a monotonous tendency to a limiting value of @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "physically , this means that once the dark energy became dominant component ( at @xmath14 ) , the universe in scm is doomed to eternal accelerated expansion .",
    "questioned the adequacy of this result is expressed repeatedly @xcite , @xcite .",
    "discovery of the transient acceleration is quite logical step to ensure the achievement of observational cosmology .",
    "the first step on this thorny path can be regarded as a model of stationary universe . to accomplish the second step , and discover the hubble expansion of the universe it took almost two thousand years .",
    "the next step , though took far less time , still met a lot of objection : even now not every body agree with what was discovered to the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "we suggest that cosmology now came close to make the next step in this direction .    in this section , we discuss some considerations , both theoretical and observational , indicating that this path .",
    "j. barrow @xcite was one of the first to rise the question of validity of such scenario .",
    "he showed that in many well - motivated scenarios the observed period of vacuum domination is only a transient phenomenon .",
    "soon after acceleration starts , the vacuum energy anti - gravitational properties are reversed , and a matter - dominated decelerating cosmic expansion resumes .",
    "thus , contrary to general expectations , once an acceleration universe does not mean an accelerating forever    to show this , we followed @xcite considering a homogeneous and isotropic universe with zero spatial curvature that contains two dominant forms of matter : a perfect fluid with pressure @xmath15 and density @xmath16 linked by an equation of state @xmath17 , with @xmath18 constant , together with a scalar quintessence field @xmath19 defined by its self - interaction potential @xmath20 .",
    "many theorists believe that fields with potentials of the form @xmath21 are predicted in the low energy limit of @xmath22-theory , where @xmath23 is a polynomial .",
    "albrecht and skordis @xcite have proposed a particularly attractive model of quintessence .",
    "it is driven by a potential which introduces a small minimum to the exponential potential , which is provided by the simplest polynomial @xmath24 and the potential takes the form @xmath25 where the constant parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are of order @xmath28 in planck units , so there is also no fine tuning of the potential . in this",
    "quintessence models , late - time acceleration is achieved without fine tuning of the initial conditions .",
    "acceleration begins when the field gets trapped in the local minimum of the potential at @xmath29 , which is created by the quadratic factor in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) when @xmath30 .",
    "once the field gets stuck in the false vacuum its kinetic energy disappears ( @xmath31 constant ) , and the ensuing dominance of @xmath32 by an almost constant value of the potential value triggers a period of accelerated expansion that never ends . in the article",
    "@xcite it was found that this type of behaviour is by no means generic .",
    "transient vacuum domination arises in two ways .",
    "when @xmath33 the @xmath19 field arrives at the local minimum with enough kinetic energy to roll over the barrier and resume descending the exponential part of the potential where @xmath34 .",
    "this kinetic energy is determined by the scaling regime , and so by parameters of the potential and not by initial conditions .",
    "another instance of transient vacuum domination is the whole region @xmath35 . as @xmath26 increases towards @xmath36 , the potential loses its local minimum , and flattens out into a point of inflexion",
    "this is sufficient to trigger accelerated expansion temporarily , but the field never stops rolling down the potential , and matter - dominated scaling evolution with @xmath37 is soon resumed .",
    "it is possible for the universe to exit from a period of accelerated expansion and resume decelerated expansion .",
    "moreover , for the well - motivated family of albrecht - skordis potentials this is the most likely form of evolution , rather than a state of continuing acceleration .",
    "a. starobinsky @xcite and co - workers investigated the course of cosmic expansion in its recent past using the constitution sn ia sample ( which includes cfa data at low redshifts ) , jointly with signatures of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the galaxy distribution and fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . allowing the equation of state of dark energy ( de ) to vary",
    ", they find that a coasting model of the universe ( @xmath38 ) fits the data about as well as @xmath0cdm .",
    "this effect , which is most clearly seen using the recently introduced @xmath39 diagnostic @xcite , corresponds to an increase of @xmath39 and @xmath40 at redshifts @xmath41 . in geometrical terms",
    ", this suggests that cosmic acceleration may have already peaked and that we are currently witnessing its slowing down .",
    "the case for evolving de strengthens if a subsample of the constitution set consisting of snls+essence+cfa sn ia data is analysed in combination with bao+cmb using the same statistical methods .",
    "note also that in article @xcite it was shown the impossibility to come to agreement with data obtained in observations sn1a about cmb by using the ansatz cpl . to make this possible",
    ", they proposed a new ansatz @xmath42}{2}. \\label{eq : step}\\ ] ] this fit ensures @xmath43 at early times , and then increases the eos to a maximum of @xmath44 at low @xmath6 .",
    "figure[fig_srarob ] shows the deceleration parameter @xmath40 and the @xmath39 diagnostic reconstructed using ( [ eq : step ] ) .    in the work @xcite for snia data ,",
    "there was used the latest union2 compilation released by the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) collaboration recently @xcite .",
    "it consists of 557 data points and is the largest published snia sample up to now ( 2010 year ) .",
    "the authors find that , independent of whether or not the systematic error is considered , there exists a tension between low redshift data ( snia+bao ) and high redshift ones ( cmb ) , but for the case with the systematic error considered this tension is weaker than without the snia . by reconstructing the curves of q(z ) and",
    "om(z ) from union2+bao , we obtain that for both the snia with and without the systematic error the cosmic acceleration has already peaked at redshift @xmath45 and is decreasing . however , when the cmb data is added in analysis , this result changes dramatically and the observation favors a cosmic expansion with an increasing acceleration , indicating a tension between low redshift data and high redshift .",
    "they find that two different subsamples+bao+cmb give completely different results on the cosmic expansion history when the systematic error is ignored , with one suggesting a decreasing cosmic acceleration , the other just the opposite , although both of them alone with bao support that the cosmic acceleration is slowing down .     at the @xmath46 confidence level .",

    "this fact complicates the analysis of our model .",
    "the fact that @xmath40 is independent of the interaction term implies that the region of phase space is the same for all of the models considered .",
    "it is possible to make some qualitative comments about the system ( [ sys_xyz_v ] ) for some special cases .    initially , considering the case , @xmath68 we obtain the constraining relation , which should be imposed on the parameters of interaction for the emergence of critical points .",
    "it is easy to show that in this case , the condition of real energy density requires @xmath69 which necessarily requires @xmath70 this critical point corresponds to the matter - dominated universe and is unstable .",
    "the cases of several such points are possible , but they are of no interest . finally , it can be shown that any of this equilibrium point within ( but not on ) the boundary will exist for @xmath71 for @xmath72 and constrain satisfied ( [ cond ] ) , it @xmath73z_c,\\ ] ] where @xmath74      in this subsection we consider in more detail the case of absence of interaction between the scalar field and dark matter .",
    "critical points of the system ( [ sys_xyz_v ] ) in this @xmath76 case are given in the table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "as can be seen from the table , the system ( [ sys_xyz_v ] ) , there are six physically admissible critical points , the latter of which is the attractor . the first critical point , @xmath77 is unstable and corresponds to the scalar field dominated era with extremely rigid equation of state , the second critical point corresponds to the period of evolution when the scalar field behaves as a cosmological constant .",
    "the other point , @xmath78 is physically unrealistic .",
