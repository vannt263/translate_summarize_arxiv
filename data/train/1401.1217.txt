    "the measurement of the frequencies and mass ratios of binary systems in clusters , which have a common age and history , can clarify how different dynamical processes contribute to their development ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a similar process can be brought to bear on questions about the formation and evolution of planetary systems . currently , there are seven cluster members known to host planets @xcite , and there are indications that small planets may be as frequent within clusters as in the field @xcite .",
    "nearby clusters have also played a large role in refining the distance scale , for example , through comparisons between parallax measurements and stellar model - based isochrone fitting .",
    "the most famous example of this is the pleiades , for which a significant discrepancy persists between _ hipparcos _ parallax measurements on one hand @xcite , and model - based distance measurements from isochrone fitting ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and eclipsing binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the other .",
    "as new parallax measurements are obtained and stellar models are developed , nearby clusters will remain crucial anchors for the distance ladder and the understanding of stellar evolution and structure .    confirmed new cluster members of nearby clusters are also prime targets for high contrast imaging searches targeted at detecting massive exoplanets .",
    "knowledge of the age of the system is essential to translate the luminosity of the detected planet candidates into planetary mass .",
    "surveying young stellar systems with known ages ( i.e.  cluster members ) can help avoid ambiguities in the interpretation of companion mass ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "pc @xcite , coma ber is farther than the hyades ( 45  pc ) but closer than praesepe ( 180  pc ) ; its age of @xmath6 myr is similar to that of the hyades ( @xmath7 myr ) and praesepe ( @xmath8 myr ) clusters @xcite .",
    "however , with @xmath9 known or suspected members , coma ber is substantially sparser than these other two clusters , which each contain several hundred members .",
    "historically , discovery and verification of members of coma ber has been challenging due to its sparsity and its low proper motion ( pm ) ( 14.9  mas  yr@xmath10 ) .",
    "@xcite identified 37 of the highest - mass coma ber members , but subsequent work has only revealed a small number of additional members @xcite .",
    "the most recent photometric and pm studies @xcite present many high - probability candidate members , but do not confirm membership with radial velocities ( rvs ) .",
    "the low - mass end of the main sequence of coma ber is currently poorly constrained , since the targets are optically faint .",
    "the list of confirmed members includes only a few early k dwarfs @xcite and no m dwarfs , although @xcite presented 76 m dwarfs and 43 k dwarfs with high membership probability based on pms and photometry .",
    "these low - mass members are of particular importance to studies of cluster dynamics , as low - mass stars are expected to be the first to evaporate from a cluster . in coma ber ,",

    "@xcite states that their 2004 period for this star was suspected to be half the true period as a result of the star having two dominant starspot groups on opposing stellar hemispheres .",
