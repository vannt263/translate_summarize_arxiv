    "consequently , a digital cavity can have arbitrarily high precision , depending on the time over which the data is acquired .",
    "data acquired for 1s gives a precision of about 1 hz in the measurement of a frequency , and higher measurement time results in better precision regardless of the frequency being measured .",
    "every digitizer , however , has the problem of electronic jitter , which introduces uncertainty in time at which digitizations happen .",
    "jitter in digital cavity is analogous to various noise sources in an analog cavity like the thermal noise and zero point fluctuation ( vacuum fluctuations ) . in the high end digitizers",
    ", jitter can be less than 100 fs .",
    "the jitter does not set an upper limit but increases the data acquisition time to reach the desired precision . with the currently available digitizers it would be possible to analyze the hyperfine transitions in atoms and molecules in general , and atoms used for atomic clocks in particular , with extremely high precision . as the digitization is controlled by a clock , precision measurements with a digital cavity",
    "can also be used to synchronize clocks .",
    "when a microwave of 20 ghz generated by a source controlled by a master clock is used for synchronization then the frequency measurement done by a digital cavity can be used to synchronize the clock of the digitizer to @xmath63s , and a day of measurement enables synchronization better than @xmath64s , which rivals the synchronization that can be achieved using analog techniques based on radio / microwave freqeuncies .",
    "@xcite however , implementing a digital cavity with stable operation for a day or longer could be challenging .",
    "we have presented the theoretical description of the digital cavity and derived some of its properties .",
    "digital cavities , in general , implement the functionality of the analog cavities in time domain and eliminate problems related to power losses in the analog cavities .",
