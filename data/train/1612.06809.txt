    "performance studies of wireless communication systems with fading channels play an important role in our understanding of novel , as well as well - established , communication schemes .",
    "the performance analysis may regard low level physical ( phy ) functions ( e.g. involving combining , modulation , detection ) @xcite , or high level phy functions ( e.g. involving retransmissions , multinode cooperation ) @xcite , for which relevant performance metrics are studied .",
    "for such analysis , analytical fading channel models , like rayleigh- , nakagami-@xmath0- , ricean- , hoyt- , log - normal - distributed fading , @xcite , are commonly encountered .    in @xcite , extending the work @xcite on a laplace transform ( lt)-oriented throughput analysis , we introduced a new performance analysis framework for wireless communication systems with fading channels . this analysis framework modeled fading channels with the matrix exponential distribution ( me - distribution ) , and gave analytical performance expressions in the parameters of the me - distribution . specifically , we focused on a two - node network for automatic repeat request ( arq ) @xcite , and hybrid - arq ( harq ) systems @xcite . in this context , we examined aspects of diversity signal processing , such as maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) and selection diversity combining ( sdc ) @xcite , multiple antenna communication schemes , such as orthogonal space - time block coding ( ostbc ) @xcite and alamouti s tx diversity @xcite . performance were evaluated with respect to ( wrt ) throughput , outage probability , mean - number of transmissions , and packet loss rate .",
    "me - distribution tools , such as the closure of the convolution and integration , were introduced for system modeling and performance analysis . in @xcite",
    ", we extended the me - distribution approach to the effective capacity performance measure for ( h)arq systems .",
    "the insight , and motivation , to introduce the me - distribution approach was due to recognizing the opportunity to give a unified matrix - algebraic bottom - up performance evaluation framework , for a wide class of fading channels , which gives very compact performance expressions .",
    "specifically , the unprocessed wireless channel signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) r.v .",
    "is compactly expressed as a me - distribution , where ( possible ) subsequent processing steps , due to communication system modeling , then gives an effective snr ( or mutual information ( mi ) ) r.v . on a me - distribution form .",
    "then , the final performance evaluation step can express a performance metric of interest with the me - distribution parameters for the unprocessed wireless channel snr , or alternatively , for the effective channel .",
    "the list of works on performance evaluation of wireless systems with fading channels is exceedingly long , and a complete account can not be given .",
    "some notable reference works , however , are @xcite , and references therein . some significant performance studies on communication cases with fading channels that consider higher phy functions are , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "there are also some important works focusing on lower phy functions , analyzing outage probability and diversity combining for general fading channels , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "all works in those areas have , as far as we know , used less versatile , and more specialized , snr fading channel models ( such as rayleigh and nakagami-@xmath0 fading ) compared to the proposed me - distribution model in @xcite , and developed further here .",
    "other works do , as far as we know , also not consistently use ( or allow for ) expression on the same form , such as the proposed me - distribution form , from modeling the unprocessed wireless channel , via possible signal processing steps , as input to higher layer performance evaluation .",
    "notably , many works do not aim for a complete bottom - up system analysis , but stop at evaluating , e.g. , symbol - error - rate ( ser ) , bit - error - rate ( ber ) , or outage probability .",
    "thus , in contrast to @xcite , many prior performance analysis works are executed on a per - case basis , for specialized channels , and for specialized communication systems only . on the other hand ,",
    "the me - distribution has been explored in a wide range of fields , such as economics ( risk and ruin probabilities ) , control theory ( linear ordinary differential equations ) , queuing theory , see e.g. @xcite , and references therein . despite this",
    ", the me - distribution has , apart from @xcite , not been considered for wireless channel snr ( or effective channel ) modeling , nor for performance evaluation for wireless systems with fading channels .",
    "only two other works , @xcite , which like @xcite , consider wireless systems , have used the me - distribution . yet , then only for queuing , but not for fading channel , analysis . however , some shortcomings of @xcite is that it focused primarily on ( h)arq system analysis , and may not have presented the me - distribution approach in a sufficiently well - structured and detailed manner in order to appreciate the full value .",
    "also , while @xcite used the me - distribution approach to analyze ( h)arq , the studied cases are unnecessarily limited , and the derived performance expressions can be simplified further",
    ". the wider application of the me - distribution approach , apart from analyzing single-/multiple - antenna and ( h)arq systems is recognized , but not discussed in great detail . in @xcite , the me - distribution approach was applied to yet another performance measure , the effective capacity , but the focus remained on ( h)arq system analysis , not the method itself .",
    "thus , the aim of this work is to emphasize and focus on the me - distribution approach as a promising tool for performance analysis of wireless communication systems with fading channels .",
    "when it comes to generalizing the me - distribution form to 1d/2d - gaussian- , and rayleigh- , like forms , which is treated at the end of this paper , we are not aware of any such works at all .",
    "the contributions are given next .",
    "this work offers several different contributions , at different levels .",
    "first , a number of results , expressions , and useful me - properties that have , to our knowledge , not been reported in the literature are presented . specifically , closed - form performance expressions , expressed in me - distribution matrix parameters , are given for the following cases : i ) rate adaptive transmission , theorem  [ thm : thm6d4 ] and [ thm : thm6d5 ] , ii ) network coded bidirectional relaying ( ncbr ) , theorem  [ thm : thm6d11 ] , iii ) arq with identical independent distributed ( iid ) me - distributed signal and interferers , theorem  [ thm : thm6d12 ] and with sylvester s equation [ thm : thm6d13 ] , iv ) differential binary phase shift keying ( psk ) and frequency shift keying ( fsk ) with non - coherent detection , theorem  [ thm : thm6d14 ] , v ) binary psk and fsk with coherent detection , theorem  [ thm : thm6d15 ] , vi ) coded transmission with independent fading , theorem  [ thm : thm6d16 ] .",
    "we also give closed - form throughput expressions for vii ) arq , theorem  [ thm : thm6d8 ] , viii ) truncated - harq , theorem  [ thm : thm6d9 ] , ix ) persistent - harq , theorem  [ thm : thm6d10 ] , for me - distributed effective channels which are on more general , but simpler , forms than in @xcite , particularly for truncated - harq .",
    "corollary  [ cr : crl6d4 ] handles , in contrast to @xcite , also @xmath1-fold diversity .",
    "some additional new results are ; x ) the integral expressions in theorem  [ thm : thm6d1 ] , corollary  [ cr : crl6d6 ] and lemma  [ lm : lm6d4 ] , xi ) the expression for the maximum of two me - distributed r.v.s in theorem  [ thm : thm6d2 ] , xii ) the integral expression in theorem  [ thm : thm6d3 ] .",
    "second , compared to @xcite , and in addition to the above , the me - distribution performance analysis framework is more clearly , and better , motivated , defined , and explored .",
    "it is made clear that the framework is generally applicable to various communication problems and performance measures .",
    "a more extensive background on well - known me - distribution properties is given , and some new ones are introduced .",
    "we generalize the ( h)arq cases in @xcite , and refine and simplify the performance expressions .",
    "third , summarizing on a higher level , we consider , analyze and give closed - form performance expressions for many new communication cases never treated with the me - distribution before , introduce the bi- ( multivariate ) me - distribution for wireless system performance analysis , extend the use of the me - distribution ( density ) to model discrete - time r.v .",
    "signals , and generalize the me - distribution to rayleigh- , univariate gaussian , and bivariate gaussian - like probability densities .      in section [ sec : sec6d2 ] , we review the me - function and the me - distribution . we motivate why the me - distribution is introduced for wireless fading channel modeling and system performance analysis in section [ sec : sec6d3 ] . in section [ sec :",
    "sec6d4 ] , we then structure the performance analysis framework , introduce the unprocessed me - distributed snr channel , and give some useful me - properties .",
    "performance evaluation , wrt relevant performance measures , for various communication cases , such as multiple antenna systems , rate - adaptive systems , modulation schemes , and ( h)arq w / wo interference , takes place in section [ sec : sec6d5 ] . in section [ sec : sec6d6 ] , the notion of me - distributed discrete - time signals is proposed , and in section [ sec : sec6d7 ] , generalizations of the me - distribution is considered . the paper is summarized and concluded in section [ sec : sec6d8 ] .",
    "we start by introducing the notion and by reviewing some basic properties of the me - function and the me - distribution .",
    "we let @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 denote polynomials , scalars , vectors , and matrices .",

    "special constants are the standard basis unit vector @xmath14 ( with a one at the @xmath15th position ) , the identity matrix @xmath16 , the shift matrix @xmath17 ( with all ones on the super - diagonal , otherwise all zero entries ) .",
    "the pdf , cdf , and the laplace transform of a pdf of a r.v . @xmath18 are written as @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "effective channel parameters are indicated with a tilde , e.g. as @xmath22 .      consider the square complex valued matrix @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath15 is a scalar .",
    "then , the matrix exponential can be defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the me - function is , e.g. , also possible to write as the limit @xmath27 using the right - hand - side ( rhs ) of , it is seen that the derivative of the me - function is @xmath28 further , using the rhs of , it is noted that @xmath29 commute .",
    "the integral of the me - function , which is a scalar integral in @xmath15 with a matrix parameter @xmath5 , can be expressed as @xmath30 given that @xmath5 is non - singular .",
    "the integral is easily proven by using the rhs of .",
    "note also that @xmath31 .    a good overview of _ nineteen dubious ways to compute the exponential of a matrix _ is found in @xcite .",
    "the me - function is also surveyed in @xcite . more practically , the me - function is , e.g. , implemented in matlab , mathematica , and maple .",
    "note that in matlab , the matrix- and scalar - exponential commands differ , and are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "next , we review the me - distribution and several well - known properties which are often presented in the literature , @xcite .    the cdf of a me - distributed r.v .",
    "@xmath18 is commonly written as @xmath34 where in general @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",

    ". the analogous me - cdf form would be @xmath45 , with me - pdf @xmath46 .",
    "the pdf would , however , have a more complicated lt than ] the laplace - stieltje s transform ( lst ) of , corresponds to the laplace transform ( lt ) of , which is @xmath47 eq .",
    "is also known ( as discussed below ) to correspond to a ratio of two polynomials expressed in the laplace variable @xmath48 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the class of rational lsts is equivalent to the class of me - distributions .",
    "it may be noted that phase - type distributions , introduced by neuts and treated in detail in @xcite , have the same form as the me - distribution , but phase - type distributions have certain parameter constraints and allows for a probabilistic interpretation @xcite .",
    "neuts @xcite states that the phase - type distribution is dense on @xmath49 , and ruiz - castro in @xcite extends this statement to the wider class of me - distributions .",
    "however , neuts @xcite also points out that _ the value of this theorem as an approximation theorem is largely illusory .",
    "no general approximation results are , in fact , known . _",
    "as discussed after , the me - distribution allows for a flexible parameter choice of @xmath4 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",

    "two works that inspired us in @xcite to consider the closure of convolutions for the me - distribution class are @xcite and @xcite .",
