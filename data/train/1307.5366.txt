    "<S> owing to the unusually narrow linewidth of @xmath1na nmr in naco17 , @xmath124 khz at @xmath13 k for @xmath14 t , we have determined the spatial distribution of the incommensurate sdw in the normal and superconducting states shown schematically in the phase diagram in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> naco17 enters into the sdw state at @xmath31 k. since na or as atoms are centered symmetrically above or below four fe atoms , there is a net magnetic field , @xmath29 , at the as or na sites along the @xmath16-axis due to in - plane magnetic moments , @xmath32 , at the fe site  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we attribute this peak to a small amplitude sdw ( s - sdw ) . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of the s - sdw at the satellite position indicates that the electric field gradient ( efg ) is significantly different or disordered at the location of those na atoms that contribute to the narrow middle peak . </S>",
    "<S> existence of an sdw below @xmath20 provides evidence for its coexistence with superconductivity , where the transition temperature was determined from coil detuning and spin lattice relaxation . from the known hyperfine field  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we determined that the moment @xmath32 for the larger sdw ( l - sdw ) was @xmath42 at @xmath43 k and @xmath14 t. if we treat the additional contribution to the linewidth of the narrower middle peak as an unresolved splitting we find the moment for the s - sdw to be @xmath44 , under the same conditions .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) we show @xmath0as spectra for the paramagnetic phase at @xmath13 k , in the sdw state @xmath45 k , and in the superconducting state at @xmath46 k for @xmath15 t along the @xmath16-axis . in the sdw state the wide hump at low frequency for the nmr central transition indicates formation of a large moment sdw . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency interval from the unshifted central - transition to the peak of the hump is @xmath120.2 t ( 1.5 mhz ) at @xmath45 k , as compared with @xmath1na nmr for which the corresponding interval is @xmath120.009 t ( 0.1 mhz ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we allow for the hyperfine field ratio , @xmath47  @xcite , the @xmath0as and @xmath1na nmr consistently depict the same amplitude for the l - sdw at @xmath45 k. we also observe an appearance of two @xmath0as peaks at the unshifted position with a splitting of 0.034 t ( 0.25 mhz ) that indicates a small moment incommensurate sdw with ( @xmath48 ) at the fe site , also in - plane , consistent with the broadening of the @xmath1na spectra discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that the center of the split spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) does not quite match the peak of the spectrum at @xmath13 k. on further cooling , the splitting persists within the superconducting state . </S>",
    "<S> we did not perform a frequency sweep to cover the whole range of the l - sdw at t = 8 k due to a drastic decrease in the signal - to - noise ratio in the superconducting state and the rather wide spread in @xmath29 at the as site . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the small magnetic moment s - sdw is consistent with reports of the amplitude of the sdw observed by neutron scattering on the same material , @xmath49  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as nmr spectra from naco17 in @xmath15 t parallel to the @xmath16-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting near 46.65 mhz in the sdw and superconducting states indicates that the central peak in the @xmath1na nmr is due to a s - sdw not inhomogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath0as nmr spectra in @xmath14 t @xmath50 @xmath17-plane.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    if the external magnetic field , @xmath33 , is aligned perpendicular to the @xmath16-axis , then the net magnetic field at either as or na sites in the sdw state becomes @xmath51 where @xmath29 is parallel to the @xmath16-axis and its shift in nmr frequency is quadratically suppressed . thus there is no splitting expected in the sdw state when @xmath33 is strictly parallel to the @xmath17-plane . if there is misalignment of @xmath33 from the @xmath17-plane , @xmath52 changes to @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the misalignment angle </S>",

    "<S> @xmath20 there are three peaks , two on each side of the unshifted position stemming from the l - sdw and misalignment ( @xmath59 ) , and the central peak appears to be from the s - sdw . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to distinguish which portion of the spectra corresponds to nuclei affected by superconductivity we have measured spin - lattice relaxation rates , @xmath60 .     </S>",

    "<S> a decrease of the rate on cooling through @xmath20 shows coexistence of the l - sdw with superconductivity on a microscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> note that there is minimal change of the transitions with magnetic field in the case of s - sdw from @xmath62.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) shows @xmath64 at the middle peak of the three - peak spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) ( s - sdw ) with @xmath14 t @xmath12parallel to the @xmath17-plane </S>",
    "<S> . on cooling @xmath64 increases due to spin fluctuations  @xcite until @xmath65 k. below this temperature @xmath64 suddenly drops arrhenius - like  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> angle resolved photo - emission ( arpes ) measurements on a similar naco17 sample  @xcite have shown that there is a remnant density of states at the fermi surface in the sdw state and consequently @xmath64 saturates at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> on further cooling , below @xmath20 , the rate decreases more rapidly due to opening of superconducting gaps at the fermi surface  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the existence of superconductivity at the spatial location of the s - sdw is clear . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , @xmath64 at either of the two side peaks corresponding to the l - sdw was found to be the same as the middle peak within @xmath66 at @xmath67 k and consequently we infer that this coexistence with superconductivity exists at a microscopic level uniformly throughout the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed @xmath62 measurements at different spectral positions : the central peak ( s - sdw ) and the hump corresponding to the l - sdw of the @xmath1na nmr spectra in different fields along the @xmath16-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) .    , with period @xmath68 in the superconducting state calculated from @xmath1na nmr  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the s - sdw is separated from the l - sdw by the dashed blue line . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the temperature dependence of the most probable magnetic moment for the l - sdw from the @xmath1na nmr spectrum is shown for two magnetic fields.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath62 behaves similar to @xmath64 increasing on cooling in the normal state and dropping abruptly below @xmath65 k and then saturating in the sdw state . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the s - sdw position in the @xmath1na spectra below @xmath20 , @xmath62 saturates similar to what was noted for optimally doped nafe@xmath69co@xmath70as(naco25 )  @xcite in contrast to @xmath62 at the l - sdw position which drops below @xmath20 similar to @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the saturated value for @xmath62 at the s - sdw corresponds to * q * = ( 0,0 ) ( intra - band ) scattering whereas @xmath62 at the l - sdw is more susceptible to * q * = ( @xmath9,0 ) or ( 0,@xmath9 ) ( inter - band ) scattering where * q * is the momentum transfer , similar to optimally doped naco25 at low temperature below @xmath20  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can calculate  @xcite the real space distribution of local fields with periodicity @xmath68 attributed to an incommensurate sdw with magnetic moment @xmath71 at the fe sites using our @xmath1na nmr spectra in @xmath14 t. fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](a ) shows this spatial distribution as a function of distance , x , in units of the sdw period , where there are two components to @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> one is the dominant l - sdw with a large magnetic moment , @xmath72 and the other is the small amplitude sdw ( s - sdw ) with moment , @xmath73 , evident in the foot of the distribution below the dashed line in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig5](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the kink at x = 0.5 is an artifact from setting the maximum range of the @xmath29 . allowing for effects of doping </S>",
    "<S> , this @xmath32 corresponds well with the magnetic moments from nmr measurements in undoped nafeas where @xmath32 was found to be @xmath74  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the small moment sdw amplitude is comparable to that found in neutron scattering measurements , @xmath49  @xcite and we suggest that this might be the dominate contribution in these experiments . </S>",
    "<S> temperature and magnetic field dependence of the most probable moment from the @xmath1na nmr spectrum is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5](b ) . below @xmath20 , </S>",
    "<S> the moment slowly increases on cooling in contrast to the decrease reported from neutron scattering measurements , which in that case corresponds to the order of magnitude smaller moment  @xcite . as the arpes measurements in co underdoped nafeas indicate that significant energy band modification due to the sdw happens at the energy levels which are far from the fermi energy , more than -50 mev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the discrepancy between the nmr measurement and the neutron scattering can be explained by the different energy excitation scale between the two probes .    </S>",
    "<S> the most natural explanation for the existence of a small moment s - sdw is the disruption of the l - sdw that takes place in the vicinity of a co atom substituted on an fe site . </S>",
    "<S> this will suppress the magnetic moment and affect the local @xmath29 sensed by @xmath1na and @xmath0as nmr . </S>",
    "<S> if this were to correspond to near neighbor and next near neighbor na positions relative to co it would affect @xmath75 of the spectrum in good agreement with our assessment of the s - sdw fraction of the nmr spectra . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the s - sdw should be transverse to the l - sdw to coexist with it . </S>",
    "<S> measurements with well - known and controlled concentrations of dopant will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis .    in summary , we have performed @xmath1na and @xmath0as nmr experiments to show microscopic coexistence of an incommensurate spin density wave and superconductivity , compatible with @xmath8-wave pairing symmetry for nafe@xmath6co@xmath7as . </S>",
    "<S> the sdw has two components differing by an order of magnitude in amplitude the smaller of which might be associated with the co substituting on an fe site . </S>"
