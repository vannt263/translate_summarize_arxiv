    "as a fundamental manifestation of quantum mechanics the tunneling through a potential barrier plays a central role in many areas of the physical sciences . being intrinsically nonlinear phenomena , quantum tunneling problems can not be attacked by standard perturbative techniques while semiclassical methods are known to provide an adequate conceptual framework @xcite .    to be specific , i consider a particle of mass @xmath1 moving in a bistable symmetric double well potential with oscillation frequency @xmath2 :    @xmath3    the minima are located at @xmath4 and the positive quartic force constant @xmath5 ( in units @xmath6 ) is related to the other potential parameters by @xmath7 .",
    "the latter term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ensures that the potential is positive defined and @xmath8 .",
    "as it will be shown in detail below , the minima are asymptotically connected by the classical _ ( anti)kink _ solution , a charge conserving domain wall whose energy is inversely proportional to @xmath5 for a given vibrational frequency inside the well .",
    "thus , even small quartic nonlinearities induce large classical energies which , in turn , enhance the effects of the quantum fluctuations in the overall probability amplitude for a particle to move from one minimum to the next .",
    "this explains why , on general grounds , perturbative methods fail to describe the tunneling physics .",
    "in general , @xmath9 models also host potentials having a quartic @xmath10 @xcite and positive sign of the quadratic term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . in this case",
    "the mid - point of the potential valley would be a classically and locally stable configuration , a metastable state from which the particle would tend to escape via quantum tunneling . in such state , known in many branches of physics as `` false vacuum '' @xcite , the system has a finite lifetime due to the presence of a negative eigenvalue in the quantum fluctuation spectrum which governs the decay into the `` true vacuum '' .",
    "the classical solution of the euler - lagrange equation for metastable potentials is a time - reversal invariant _ bounce _ carrying zero charge .",
    "also this object , whose physical properties generally differ from the _ ( anti)kink _ , has an energy inversely proportional to the anharmonic parameter @xmath5 which makes perturbative analysis of metastability unfeasible .    it has been noted since long that the @xmath11 singularity in the thermodynamic limit of the partition function for the anharmonic potential is formally similar to the condensation point in the droplet model for phase nucleations @xcite . the nature of such singularity has been widely studied in the past also in connection with fundamental investigations of the anharmonic oscillator and its energy levels @xcite .",
    "tunneling problems in quantum field theory have been treated by semiclassical methods @xcite which extend the wkb approximation @xcite and determine the spectrum of quadratic quantum fluctuations around the classical background .",
    "while such methods had been first applied to infinite size systems , generalizations to finite sizes @xcite have been later on developed to obtain correlation functions and spectra of @xmath9 potentials @xcite .",
    "the casimir effect in @xmath9 theories is another remarkable example in which the properties of the system depend on the size of the cavity @xcite .",
    "finite size effects have become a focus of research also on classical mechanical systems @xcite in which spatio - temporal noise of classical origin induces escape from a metastable state .",
    "examples of current technological interest are the switching rate in the magnetization of micromagnets @xcite and the finite lifetime of metallic nanowires shaped by cylinders whose radius undergoes fluctuations of thermal origin @xcite .",
    "such systems exhibit a structure of thermal activation regimes which crucially depend on the system size @xmath12 and the boundary conditions .",
    "the transition in the classical activation rate versus @xmath0 is formally identical to the crossover from the classical activation to the quantum tunneling regime once @xmath0 is made proportional to the inverse temperature of the system .",
    "in general , the finite size formalism offers the bridge to derive the thermodynamics of the system in the spirit of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz @xcite : this is accomplished by a wick rotation which transforms the real time @xmath13 into the imaginary time @xmath14 of the matsubara formalism , @xmath15 , where @xmath14 varies in a periodic spatial box of finite size @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the boltzman constant and @xmath19 the temperature .",
    "accordingly the infinite size system maps onto the zero temperature limit .    with these premises ,",
    "the path integral method in the euclidean version @xcite emerges as a natural tool to deal with finite size / temperature tunneling phenomena in semiclassical approximation .",
    "the quantum probability amplitude is given in terms of a functional integral over all histories of the system depicted by those @xmath20 dependent paths which fulfill ( anti)periodic boundary conditions over a size @xmath0 .",
    "in the semiclassical treatment , the functional integral reduces to gaussian path integrals over quadratic quantum fluctuations around the classical solution of the euler - lagrange equation . the fluctuations contribution to the amplitude",
    "can be evaluated by a number of techniques in the context of the functional determinants theory @xcite that implements the euclidean path integral method . while the latter is well known for the infinite size system ( both for bistable and metastable @xmath9 models ) @xcite , much less known is the mathematics and the associated physics for the finite size case .",
    "a contribution to the research field comes from this paper which analyses the finite size euclidean path integral for the bistable @xmath9 model proposing a new family of classical backgrounds .",
    "i emphasize that the model is intrinsecally non dissipative as there is no coupling to the heat bath while the temperature , as stated above , provides a measure of the system size .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the solution of the euler - lagrange equation , the finite time instanton which minimizes the euclidean action .",
    "this family of paths , expressed in terms of jacobi elliptic functions , generalizes the ( anti)kink peculiar of the infinite time theory and interpolates between the minima of the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "section 3 presents the generalities of the semiclassical path integral formalism posing the problem of the evaluation of the quantum fluctuations functional determinant .",
    "the latter is derived in terms of elliptic integrals and analysed in section 4 .",
    "some final remarks are made in section 5 .",
    "consider the potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the real time formalism does not allow classical motion in a double well potential but , switching to the imaginary time formalism @xmath21 , the potential is reversed upside down and the classical orbit @xmath22 is obtained by solving the classical equation of motion :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 means derivative with respect to @xmath25 . integrating eq .",

    "represents the time at which the bottom of the valley ( of the reversed potential ) is crossed and , by virtue of the @xmath20 translational invariance , it can be placed everywhere along the imaginary time axis .",

    "this study permits to compute , for specific choices of potential parameters , the finite size induced renormalization of the tunneling energy with respect to the predictions of the infinite size instantonic approach . in view of the mapping to the temperature axis allowed by the matsubara formalism , the obtained results may be well applied to calculate , for instance , the thermodynamical properties of systems described by ginzburg - landau field theories @xcite , the finite @xmath19 splitting energy in two level systems arising in amorphous compounds @xcite and materials with local structural instabilities @xcite as well as in solids showing macroscopic quantum tunneling of magnetization @xcite .",
    "along similar semiclassical patterns one can study a metastable @xmath9 model in finite size . for the latter one has to build the generalized bounce solution ( whose properties however differ very much from those of the instanton ) and analyse the quantum fluctuation spectrum with particular care to the ground state negative eigenvalue which causes metastability . the softening of the low lying fluctuation modes together with the decay rate for a finite size system will be the subject of a next work .",
