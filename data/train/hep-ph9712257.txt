    "the inclusive @xmath2 decay has attracted a lot of attention in the past and will undoubtfully attract at least as much attention in the future . on one side , it is an observed flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) process with the measured rate @xmath15 announced by cleo@xcite , and @xmath16 found most recently by the aleph coll.@xcite , and we can expect that the statistical uncertainty of these measurements will be reduced in the near future . on the other side , the standard model ( sm ) prediction with the next - to - leading order qcd corrections included has been calculated as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , since forbidden at tree level it lets the sm compete with the loop contributions from any new physics .",
    "theoretical analyses of this process , which assume minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the sm and are constrained by unification , naturally fall into two categories .",
    "either tan@xmath0 ( the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath18 ) is considered to be low ( _ i.e. , _ close to 1 ) or this parameter is large , of the order 50 .    in the first case ,",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are of the order of the electroweak scale and the hierarchy @xmath21 is triggered by the smallness of the @xmath1 and @xmath22 yukawa couplings @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in effect",
    ", this regime of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has several simple features : radiative electroweak symmetry breaking is rather straightforward to impose , and the terms suppressed by @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be neglected both in the renormalization group equations ( rges ) and in the analysis at the @xmath25 scale . a drawback , if we can say so , is that when considering the mssm as a low energy effective theory , there is no appealing unification dynamics requiring the hierarchy @xmath23,@xmath26 .",
    "the large tan@xmath0 case , on the other hand , is very attractive when considered from the unification point of view .",
    "using the mssm rges one finds that this case offers an amazingly simple option @xmath27 at the unification scale , consistent with the minimal @xmath28 grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "the third generation mass hierarchy is , however , explained by @xmath29-@xmath30gev , the value which is much less than the electroweak scale - the generic scale of the other dimensionful parameters , including @xmath31 . that makes the mssm analysis with large tan@xmath0 challenging in more than just the symmetry breaking sector .",
    "for example , there are fermion masses which are proportional to @xmath20 at tree level , and there is no symmetry which would guarantee the same suppression in their radiative corrections .",
    "contributions at one - loop may be and indeed are proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "the same type of corrections are then also induced to some ckm matrix elements , e.g. @xmath32 or @xmath33 . as a result",
    ", the tan@xmath0 enhanced corrections to such observables must be included into the mssm analysis .",
    "inclusive @xmath2 decay represents an even more sensitive probe if tan@xmath0 is large . as an fcnc process emerging only at a loop level its sm contribution turns out to be suppressed by @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the chargino - squark contributions are proportional to @xmath31 and may dominate the whole process . thus the mssm analysis becomes more powerful ( and restrictive ) than in the case with low tan@xmath0 .    in this work",
    ", we present the results of such a constrained global analysis of the mssm with large tan@xmath0 and pay special attention to the structure of the @xmath2 partial amplitudes .",
    "our actual investigation has been performed within a complete @xmath28 model proposed by lucas and raby@xcite .",
    "the model ( called model 4c ) , was analyzed in detail in @xcite and a very good agreement with low energy data ( including fermion masses and mixings ) was found in a large region of the susy parameter space .",
    "although the primary goal of the analysis was to discriminate among different models of fermion masses , this model turned out to work so well , that the main constraints were the @xmath1 quark mass and the @xmath34 . as a result",
    "we can regard the work as testing the mssm with large tan@xmath0 , with the inclusion of a particular set of 3@xmath353 non - diagonal yukawa matrices at the gut scale .",
    "thus we think that this letter naturally fits into the mosaic of many previous works on @xmath2 in the mssm .",
    "these works studied the @xmath2 process either with low ( or moderate , i.e. less than about 10 ) tan@xmath0 only@xcite or , if the large tan@xmath0 regime was also considered @xcite , then some of the important ingredients of our procedure were not taken into account .",
    "most notably , we improve the previous studies _ ( i ) _ by taking into account the tan@xmath0 enhanced susy threshold corrections to fermion masses and mixings , and _",
    "( ii ) _ by introducing global analysis instead of scatter plots of random points in susy parameter space . due to the latter improvement we can present the contour plots of the interesting quantities from the best fits and observe how these quantities are correlated . additional motivation for",
    "this paper came from the study @xcite .",
    "this work has also introduced global analysis , with one - loop susy threshold corrections properly included , and studied both the low and large tan@xmath0 regimes . however",
    ", this analysis assumed strict gauge unification with no threshold correction to @xmath3 at the gut scale . as a result , it did not concentrate on the regime with rather low values of @xmath36 and positive susy corrections to @xmath37 . therefore , that work does not test the subspace in susy parameter space which we study in this analysis appears to be excluded  see the discussion on negative @xmath38 parameter in section 3 and in @xcite .",
    "( in our conventions , @xmath39 implies negative susy corrections to the @xmath1 quark mass and purely constructive interference among all leading mssm contributions to the decay @xmath2 . ) ] .",
    "thus our main result is that in the regime of susy parameter space where tan@xmath0 is large and the @xmath1 quark mass receives positive corrections we find the analysis consistent with @xmath40 unification and the observed br(@xmath2 ) , in contradiction to previous studies .",
    "dominant effects come from the third generation yukawa couplings and the introduction of @xmath41 , a gut threshold to @xmath3 . in the best fits ,",
    "small negative @xmath41 is correlated with lower @xmath42 , and that in effect decreases @xmath37 .",
    "we also find that the contribution of the inter - generational @xmath43-@xmath44 squark mixing to the @xmath2 amplitude ( tan@xmath0 enhanced compared to the sm contribution ) is numerically significant .",
    "it is , however , model dependent .",
    "note that it is neglected in the approximation of barbieri - giudice @xcite which has been used in many of the succeeding studies .",
    "the main steps of our procedure are described in section 2 . for completeness , the performance of model 4c in the global analysis is presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains the results of this work .",
    "it starts with comment on model sensitivity and includes contour plots in the ( @xmath7 ) plane of constant @xmath34 and various contributions to this process , extracted from our best fits .",
    "we show how the destructive interference among the @xmath2 partial amplitudes provides for two distinct fits , each of a very low @xmath45 in rather complementary regions of the parameter space .",
    "we also discuss phenomenological implications of our findings .",

    "details of our numerical analysis are described in @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the main steps of our procedure relevant for this letter .",
    "we perform a global analysis in a strict top - down approach .",

    "by @xmath50 we actually mean the value @xmath51 one - loop gut threshold correction @xmath41 to @xmath52 , and a : the 33 element common to all three yukawa matrices at @xmath46 .",
    "we assume supergravity induced susy breaking and neglect the effects of running between the planck scale and the gut scale .",
    "the parameters of the susy sector , which are introduced at @xmath46 , include a common gaugino mass @xmath53 , common scalar mass @xmath54 of squark and slepton mass matrices , scalar higgs mass parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 and a universal dimensionful trilinear coupling @xmath57 . for simplicity ,",
    "the @xmath38 parameter and its susy breaking bilinear partner @xmath58 are introduced at the @xmath25 scale , since they are renormalized multiplicatively and do not enter the rges of the other parameters . in the actual model",
    "4c analysis , the structure of the yukawa matrices at @xmath46 is built up using six more dimensionless parameters . as explained in section 4 , these are small numbers and their effects decouple from the observables related to the gauge and susy sectors and from the masses of the third generation fermions .",
    "we use the two - loop rges for the gauge and yukawa couplings , and the one - loop rges for the mssm dimensionful parameters to run down to the @xmath25 scale . at selected points , we check that the full two - loop rges of the mssm @xcite yield the same results . at the @xmath25 scale ,",
    "the mssm is matched to the effective theory consisting of qcd and electromagnetism , leaving out the sm as an effective theory . within the mssm",

    "electroweak symmetry breaking is established implicitly in the process of the @xmath45 minimization by the evaluation of the fermion and gauge boson masses .",
    "the latter are calculated with the full mssm one - loop corrections included .",
    "we also compute all the threshold corrections , proportional to tan@xmath0 , to fermion masses and ckm matrix elements , following @xcite .",

    "the enhancement by tan@xmath0 of the chargino contribution has to be compensated for by rather large masses of the sparticles in the diagrams in figures [ f_dg]c  e . in the second case , described by eq.([r_c_ac ] ) , large destructive chargino interference is required to outweigh the combined sm and @xmath106 contributions and to flip the overall sign of the amplitude .",
    "quite amazingly , it is not so difficult to arrange ( see also @xcite ) since the chargino contribution is the only one enhanced by large tan@xmath0 .",
    "however , large sparticle masses obviously suppress the effect .",
    "the lesson is that we can expect the two cases to work in a complementary susy parameter space and have @xmath112 @xmath113 for the best fits in the region with large ( low ) @xmath54 and/or @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "these expectations are indeed realized in the best fits of model 4c .",
    "figure 2a shows the best fits in the case when the chargino contribution roughly cancels the charged higgs contribution , while the best fits of figure 2b correspond to the case when the chargino piece truly dominates and reverses the sign of the overall amplitude . as anticipated , these two cases work in complementary regions of parameter space .",
    "figures [ f_brgam]a and [ f_brgam]b show how well the fits describe the measured value of the @xmath34 . in these figures",
    "( and similarly in the following ones ) we show the contour lines of constant @xmath45 in the background for reference .",
    "as can be seen , the @xmath34 indeed presents a major constraint since whenever the @xmath45 values go up , the agreement with the observed @xmath2 decay rate gets worse . figures [ f_rh]a  b and [ f_rc]a  b show the contour plots of constant @xmath107 and @xmath108 in each of these two cases .",
    "one can compare the numerical results in these figures with the approximate relations ( [ r_c_ac ] ) and ( [ r_c_ac ] ) .",
    "note also the validity of relation ( [ r_h ] ) in each case .",
    "finally note that due to large tan@xmath0 the effects of susy decoupling start showing up only for @xmath114tev , _",
    "i.e. _ outside the susy space studied in these figures",
    ".      there is one striking feature which is common to both cases .",
    "it is that both fits would like to have the @xmath34 below rather than above the current experimental value @xmath115 .    in the first case",
    ", the tan@xmath0 enhanced chargino contribution tends to be too large when going against the charged higgs contribution , since the latter is not tan@xmath0 enhanced .",
    "the fit clearly favors as large higgs contribution as possible with @xmath107 reaching its maximum ( see fig.[f_rh]a ) .",
    "a phenomenological consequence of this observation is that the charged higgs ( and then also the whole higgs sector ) tends to be as light as possible in this case .",
    "we get , for instance , the best fit value of the pseudoscalar mass @xmath116gev everywhere in the @xmath77 plane .    in the second case , when the chargino part overshoots the combined sm and @xmath106 contributions we observe different effects in the regions with @xmath53 below and above ( roughly ) @xmath117gev . for larger values of @xmath53",
    "the chargino contribution clearly tends to be not big enough . as a result",
    "we might expect to see only very low values of @xmath107 in this region  complementary to the large values in fig.[f_rh]a  and a very heavy higgs sector .",
    "however , the best fit value of @xmath107 varies quite a bit indicating that the charged higgs mass does not stay at some very large value .",
    "that is related to the observation @xcite that one can not have good fits with the higgs sector much heavier than squarks .",
    "when @xmath53 gets below @xmath117gev the @xmath2 decay rate is no longer a strong constraint and two separate minima can be found in the course of the optimization .",
    "the two fits work equally well : @xmath45 in each case stays below 1 per 3dof .",
    "the minima differ by the best fit values of the higgs masses : one minimum corresponds to @xmath118 and @xmath119 at the experimental lower limit ( set to @xmath120gev in our analysis ) while these masses gradually rise in the second `` valley '' up to @xmath121gev .",
    "when crossing the region with @xmath122gev towards larger @xmath53 , the first `` valley '' vanishes and the optimization slides down to the second minimum because of the @xmath34 . in the allowed corner with @xmath123gev , the two `` valleys '' approach each other and finally coincide . the effect of the doubled minima is indicated in figures [ f_rh]b and [ f_rc]b with the solid black ( dashed gray ) contour lines corresponding to the heavier ( lighter ) higgs sectorb and [ f_dmb]b . ] .    in summary ,",
    "if the future experimental analysis confirms the discrepancy between the cleo measured value and the nlo sm calculation @xcite , the mssm with large tan@xmath0 could be the solution .",
    "similarly , if the nlo calculation is completed for the mssm , and if it turns out to increase the lo result as occurred for the sm , then the large tan@xmath0 regime will apparently have no problem fitting the @xmath2 rate exactly .",
    "that seems to be in contrast with the fits in the low tan@xmath0 regime of ref.@xcite , which get below the sm value only for @xmath124gev and small @xmath54 .",
    "it is interesting to note the significance of the inter - generational squark mixing in fig.[f_dg]e . in analogy",
    "to eq s ( [ rh ] ) , ( [ rc ] ) we define r^(c23 )",
    "= c_7^(c23 ) / c_7^(sm ) , [ rc23 ] where @xmath127 is the @xmath43-@xmath44 mixing contribution to the coefficient @xmath90 at the scale @xmath60 .",
    "we show the contour plots of the constant @xmath128 in figures [ f_rc23]a and [ f_rc23]b . while the dominant chargino contribution is that proportional to the @xmath44-@xmath129 mixing ( fig.3c ) , @xmath127 becomes important because of the destructive character of the interference among the partial amplitudes .",
    "as one can see , the @xmath43-@xmath44 mixing term can be comparable with the sm and @xmath106 contributions .",
    "more importantly , it always interferes constructively with them . in the case",
    "when @xmath130 @xmath113 , this term helps to counterbalance the large contribution of the left - right stop mixing . in the complementary case ,",
    "when the chargino contribution overturns the sign of the net amplitude the @xmath43-@xmath44 mixing makes this flip more difficult to happen . as a result , it has different consequences for the two fits in figures 2a and 2b , especially important in the region ( @xmath131gev,@xmath132gev ) where the fits start getting worse . in figure 2a",
    ", it improves the fit for lower values of @xmath77 where the contribution from the stop mixing alone would otherwise overwhelm the sum of the sm and @xmath106 diagrams . on the contrary",
    ", it worsens the fit in figure 2b in the same parameter subspace .",
    "these observations are , however , model dependent as has been explained in the introduction to this section , and their validity relies on the boundary conditions assumed at the gut scale .",
    "a general study of the limits imposed by the inter - generational mixings can be found in the review @xcite and the references therein . to make a connection with the general approach we note that typically we get ( ^23_u)_ll ~-(0.010.02 ) [ delta ] at the @xmath25 scale , where @xmath133 is the @xmath134 @xmath135 squark mass matrix after the unitary rotations which diagonalize the fermionic sector are performed in the squark sector too (  sandwiching by @xmath136 s in this particular case ) .",
    "this value is to be compared with the flavor  changing effects originating in the ckm matrix ( figures [ f_dg]a  d ) with @xmath137 .      finally , we would like to comment on the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections .",
    "these have been completed only for the sm @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was shown that the nlo matching at the high scale gives a non - negligible contribution to @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , for the sm we get c_7^eff(_b)&=&c_7^(0)eff(_b ) + ( ^39/23c_7^(1)(m_z ) + ( ^-^ ) c_8^(1)(m_z ) + ) + & = & -0.312 + 0.017(-0.883 - 0.111 + ) , [ c_7_nlo ] where @xmath138 is given in terms of the lo matching coefficients ( our eq.([c_7_eff ] ) ) and for the evaluation in the second line @xmath105 was assumed .",
    "hence within the sm the nlo matching corrections @xmath139 and @xmath140 alone would change the rate by about 10% .",
    "the final nlo corrected result increases the lo value obtained at @xmath141 by about 20% .",
    "( in other words , it effectively lowers the scale @xmath142 of the lo calculations to about @xmath143 as obtained also in ref.@xcite . ) in the mssm , the nlo matching remains to be calculated .",
    "clearly , with large tan@xmath0 the chargino diagrams will likely dominate and their contribution may cause a different effect than in the sm . for",
    "that reason we have left our results without applying the nlo corrections and will just sketch at this point what effects the higher order matching corrections may have in our best fits .    the case when @xmath130 @xmath113 is much like the sm case .",
    "the effect of the unknown @xmath144 and @xmath145 can be readily estimated from the complete form of eq.([c_7_nlo ] ) quoted in @xcite .",
    "if the nlo matching followed the cancellation among the charged higgs and chargino contributions observed in the lo ( eq.([r_c_ac ] ) ) , our results for the @xmath34 would also be about 20% larger , similar to the sm calculation .",
    "we can see from figure [ f_brgam]a that this would increase the parameter space in this case .",
    "effectively , the nlo terms would add to the lo contributions of @xmath146 and @xmath106 , enabling the tan@xmath0 enhanced chargino contribution to be greater in magnitude than what is allowed by eq.([r_c_ac ] )  a welcome feature for lighter susy spectra .",
    "clearly , if the nlo matching terms remain negative and get even larger in magnitude than in the sm case , the fit will improve substantially in the region with low @xmath54 and @xmath53 ( and may get somehow worse in the upper left corner of the @xmath77 plane ) .",
    "on the other hand , we have checked that our lo results remain unaltered for @xmath147 , @xmath148 : for such matching terms all nlo corrections practically sum up to zero .",
    "only if the nlo matching terms turn out to be very large and positive , the fit will be forced to retreat significantly towards larger @xmath53 values .",
    "the second case , @xmath149 @xmath113 , is obviously more sensitive to the unknown nlo matching . despite the sensitivity",
    "our sample calculations indicate that a drop in the value of the @xmath34 is fairly common and more likely to happen than an enhancement .",
    "for instance , we get @xmath150 in the complete nlo calculation assuming the nlo matching terms are @xmath151 , @xmath148 , and keeping @xmath152 and @xmath153 at the values which yield @xmath154 at the lo .",
    "the reduction in the rate is correlated with the opposite signs of @xmath90 and @xmath97 as compared to the sm case .",
    "however , it still holds that the nlo correction would be effectively taken into account by lowering the scale in the lo calculation . for the region with @xmath155gev , where the fit gradually gets worse in this case ,",
    "it means that the @xmath2 decay is likely more constraining than it appears in the analysis based on the lo calculation . as indicated above",
    ", the nlo corrections will improve the fit only if the nlo matching terms are at least seven times larger and opposite in sign compared to the sm nlo matching terms .      for the presented results , it has been important to have a destructive interference among the partial contributions to @xmath2 . with the universal boundary conditions at the gut scale",
    "however , that can be arranged only for a specific sign of the @xmath38 parameter : @xmath157 in our conventions .",
    "that in turn correlates with the positive sign of the susy corrections to the @xmath1 quark mass @xcite .",
    "this fact implies strong constraints on the susy parameter space from @xmath37 since @xmath156 gets a dominant contribution from the tan@xmath0 enhanced gluino exchange , which tends to be very large @xcite and offsets the agreement between the low energy value of @xmath37 and the @xmath1@xmath22 unification at the gut scale .",
    "the gluino correction can be explicitly suppressed by heavy squarks and by the chargino correction which enters with the opposite sign is determined by the product @xmath158 ( the dominant part comes from the same diagram as in fig.[f_dg]c with @xmath159 replaced by @xmath160 and no photon leg attached ) .",
    "our best fits always run into the region where @xmath161 turns out negative , in the conventions which maintain positive gluino mass parameter . ] .",
    "it can also be reduced by lower values of @xmath42 because of the strong couplings in the vertices of the gluino  @xmath1-squark diagram .",
    "the contour plots of the total susy correction to @xmath162 in the best fits are shown in figures [ f_dmb]a  b where one can see that these effects are quite effective in reducing the value of @xmath163 .",
    "note that the impact of large positive @xmath156 is reduced by a lower value of @xmath42 also indirectly  due to the rg evolution of the current @xmath1 mass from @xmath60 down to @xmath164 .",
    "the effect is enhanced if the current mass @xmath37 is converted to the perturbative pole mass @xmath164 in a top  down analysis .",
    "for example , the difference between @xmath42 being 0.115 and 0.121 leads to about 5% difference in @xmath164 , if the same value of @xmath162 is assumed in each case .",
    "this is a significant effect . in our analysis , which assumes larger uncertainty for @xmath3 than for @xmath94 , it pushes @xmath42 down .",
    "the effect can be seen in figures [ f_alpha_s]a  b .",
    "note that one can trade lower values of @xmath3 for higher values of @xmath37 provided a smaller uncertainty @xmath165 is assumed @xcite .",
    "rather low values of @xmath42 are , however , difficult to obtain from the exact gauge coupling unification , traditionally assumed in an mssm analysis constrained by unification . in our analysis , we assumed that there is a few per cent correction to the gauge coupling unification generated by the spread in masses of heavy states integrated out at the gut scale .",
    "it turned out that with a few per cent negative correction @xmath41 to @xmath166 we can accommodate lower values of @xmath42 with no problem .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath41 are presented in figures [ f_eps3]a  b .",
    "clearly , as squarks get lighter the susy correction to @xmath162 ( fig.[f_dmb ] ) has to be increasingly reduced by lower values of @xmath42 ( fig.[f_alpha_s ] ) , which in turn requires a more substantial departure from the gauge coupling unification ( fig.[f_eps3 ] ) in the respective susy parameter subspace .",
    "in summary , we have presented the results of the mssm analysis focusing on the constraint imposed by the measured value of the @xmath34 .",
    "the analysis was motivated by the best of the @xmath28 susy gut models studied previously .",
    "large tan@xmath0 was assumed as a consequence of simple so(10 ) flavor dynamics .",
    "we showed that the effective amplitude for the inclusive @xmath2 decay can be of either sign in such a scenario . in the case , when the sign is the same as in the sm calculation , the often neglected inter - generational @xmath43-@xmath44 squark mixing and the nlo correction tend to increase the allowed susy parameter space .",
    "the best fits favor light higgs spectrum since a substantial charged higgs contribution to @xmath2 helps to counterbalance the chargino contribution . in the complementary case ,",
    "when the sign of the @xmath90 coefficient is flipped by a large chargino contribution , both the @xmath43-@xmath44 mixing and the nlo correction work the other way and tend to reduce the allowed susy parameter space .",
    "the charged and pseudoscalar higgs masses can be either large or small . in each case , the chargino ( and neutralino ) masses are at the experimental limit in the best fits . because of @xmath167 the best fits result in rather low values of @xmath42 , which can be obtained with a few per cent negative correction to @xmath166 . with these guidelines",
    "the large tan@xmath0 regime of the mssm constrained by simple @xmath28 guts remains a viable option for physics beyond the standard model .",
