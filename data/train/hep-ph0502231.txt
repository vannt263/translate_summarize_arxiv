    "it is well known that a neutrino with non - zero mass may have non - trivial electromagnetic properties . in particular , the dirac massive neutrino can posses non - vanishing magnetic and electric dipole moments .",
    "it is believed that non - zero neutrino magnetic moment could have an important impact on astrophysics and cosmology .    in the minimally extended standard model with @xmath1-singlet right - handed neutrino",
    "the one - loop radiative correction generates neutrino magnetic moment which is proportional to the neutrino mass @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bohr magneton , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the neutrino and electron masses , respectively .",
    "there are also models @xcite in which much large values for magnetic moments of neutrinos are predicted .",
    "so far , the most stringent laboratory constraints on the electron , muon , and tau neutrino magnetic moments come from elastic neutrino - electron scattering experiments",
    ". the now days constraints for the magnetic moments of the three flavour neutrinos are as follows @xcite : @xmath6 .",
    "the recent studies of a massive neutrino electromagnetic properties within the one - loop level , including the neutrino magnetic moment , can be found in @xcite , the detailed discussion on the neutrino charge radius is also presented in @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic properties of a massive neutrino in external electromagnetic fields were studied in @xcite and in the background matter were discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) .    in a series of papers @xcite",
    "we have predicted that a massive neutrino moving in matter and external electromagnetic and/or gravitational fields can emit electromagnetic radiation due the neutrino non - zero magnetic moment .",
    "we have named this radiation the `` spin light of neutrino '' ( @xmath0 ) in matter and external fields .",
    "the quasi - classical theory of the @xmath0 in matter was developed in @xcite on the basis of bargmann - michel - telegdi equation generalized @xcite for the case of a neutrino moving in external fields . in our recent papers",
    "@xcite we have developed the quantum approach to the @xmath0 in matter .",
    "however , at the final stage of the performed calculations of the the @xmath0 rate and total power we have considered the limit of low matter density .",
    "therefore , the evaluation of the consistent quantum theory of the @xmath0 in matter has still remained an open issue .",
    "note that the neutrino radiation due to the magnetic moment interaction with a constant magnetic field was considered in @xcite .    here",
    "below we present the quantum theory of the neutrino spin - light exactly accounting for the effect of the background matter on the basis of the obtained @xcite exact solutions of the modified dirac equation for the neutrino wave function in matter .",
    "for developing of the quantum theory of the @xmath0 in matter one has to find the neutrino wave functions with the effect of matter accounted for . to derive the quantum equation for the neutrino wave function in the background matter we start with the effective lagrangian that describes the neutrino interaction with particles of the background matter . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the case of the electron neutrino @xmath7 propagating through moving and polarized matter composed of only electrons ( the electron gas ) .",
    "assume that the neutrino interactions are described by the extended standard model supplied with @xmath1-singlet right - handed neutrino @xmath8 .",
    "we also suppose that there is a macroscopic amount of electrons in the scale of a neutrino de broglie wave length .",
    "therefore , the interaction of a neutrino with the matter ( electrons ) is coherent . in this case",
    "the averaged over the matter electrons addition to the vacuum neutrino lagrangian , accounting for the charged and neutral interactions , can be written in the form @xmath9 where the electrons current @xmath10 and electrons polarization @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lag_f ] ) accounts for the possible effect of the matter motion and polarization .",
    "here @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 being added , we derive the following modified dirac equation for the neutrino moving in the background matter , @xmath18 this is the most general equation of motion for a neutrino in which the effective potential @xmath19 accounts for both the charged and neutral - current interactions with the background matter and also for the possible effects of the matter motion and polarization .",
    "if we neglect the contribution of the neutral - current interaction and possible effects of motion and polarization of the matter then from ( [ new ] ) we can get corresponding equations for the left - handed and right - handed chiral components of the neutrino field derived in @xcite .",
    "the generalizations of the modified dirac equation ( [ new ] ) for more complicated matter compositions ( and the other flavour neutrinos ) are just straightforward . for instance , if one considers the case of realistic matter composed of electrons , protons and neutrons , then the matter term in ( [ new ] ) is ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite and the second paper of @xcite ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the value of the isospin third component of a fermion @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the value of its electric charge and @xmath26 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the fermion s currents @xmath27 and polarizations @xmath28 are given by eqs.([j ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) with the appropriate substitutions : @xmath29 .    in the further discussion below we",
    "consider the case when no electromagnetic field is present in the background .",
    "we also suppose that the matter is unpolarized , @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the term describing the neutrino interaction with the matter is given by @xmath31 where we use the notation @xmath32 .    in the rest frame of the matter",
    "the equation ( [ new ] ) can be written in the hamiltonian form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the neutrino momentum .",
    "we use the pauli - dirac representation for the dirac matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in which @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the pauli matrixes .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian ( [ h_g ] ) implies that the operators of the momentum , @xmath41 , and longitudinal polarization , @xmath42 , are the integrals of motion .",
    "so that , in particular , we have @xmath43 where the values @xmath44 specify the two neutrino helicity states , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the relativistic limit",
    "the negative - helicity neutrino state is dominated by the left - handed chiral state ( @xmath47 ) , whereas the positive - helicity state is dominated by the right - handed chiral state ( @xmath48 ) .    for the stationary states of the equation ( [ new ] ) we get @xmath49 where @xmath50 is independent on the coordinates and time . upon the condition that the equation ( [ new ] ) has a non - trivial solution",
    ", we arrive to the energy spectrum of a neutrino moving in the background matter : @xmath51 where we use the notation @xmath52 the quantity @xmath53 splits the solutions into the two branches that in the limit of the vanishing matter density , @xmath54 , reproduce the positive and negative - frequency solutions , respectively .",
    "it is also important to note that the neutrino energy in the background matter depends on the state of the neutrino longitudinal polarization , i.e. in the relativistic case the left - handed and right - handed neutrinos with equal momenta have different energies .",
    "the procedure , similar to one used for derivation of the solution of the dirac equation in vacuum , can be adopted for the case of a neutrino moving in matter .",
    "we apply this procedure to the equation ( [ new ] ) and arrive to the final form of the wave function of a neutrino moving in the background matter : @xmath55 where the energy @xmath56 is given by ( [ energy]),@xmath57 is the normalization length and @xmath58 . in the limit of vanishing density of matter , when @xmath59 , the wave function ( [ wave_function ] ) transforms to the vacuum solution of the dirac equation .    the quantum equation ( [ new ] ) for a neutrino in the background matter with the obtained exact solution ( [ wave_function ] ) and energy spectrum ( [ energy ] ) establish a basis for a very effective method ( similar to the furry representation of quantum electrodynamics ) in investigations of different phenomena that can appear when neutrinos are moving in the media .",
    "let us now consider in some detail the properties of a neutrino energy spectrum ( [ energy ] ) in the background matter that are very important for understanding of the mechanism of the neutrino spin light phenomena .",
    "for the fixed magnitude of the neutrino momentum @xmath60 there are the two values for the `` positive sign '' ( @xmath61 ) energies @xmath62 that determine the positive- and negative - helicity eigenstates , respectively .",
    "the energies in eq.([energy_nu ] ) correspond to the particle ( neutrino ) solutions in the background matter .",
    "the two other values for the energy , corresponding to the negative sign @xmath63 , are for the antiparticle solutions . as usual , by changing the sign of the energy , we obtain the values @xmath64 that correspond to the positive- and negative - helicity antineutrino states in the matter .",
    "the expressions in eqs.([energy_nu ] ) and ( [ energy_anti_nu ] ) would reproduce the neutrino dispersion relations of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , if the contribution of the neutral - current interaction to the neutrino potential were left out .",
    "in this section we should like to use the obtained solutions ( [ wave_function ] ) of the equation ( [ new ] ) for a neutrino moving in the background matter for the study of the spin light of neutrino ( @xmath0 ) in the matter .",
    "we develop below the _ quantum _ theory of this effect exactly accounting for the matter number density @xmath15 .",
    "note that in our previous studies @xcite the @xmath0 rate and radiation power were derived in the limit of not very high densities of the background matter ( see also our comments to eq.([gamma_1 ] ) below ) .    within the quantum approach , the corresponding feynman diagram of the @xmath0 in the matter is the standard one - photon emission diagram with the initial and final neutrino states described by the `` broad lines ''  that account for the neutrino interaction with the matter .",
    "it follows from the usual neutrino magnetic moment interaction with the quantized photon field , that the amplitude of the transition from the neutrino initial state @xmath65 to the final state @xmath66 , accompanied by the emission of a photon with a momentum @xmath67 and polarization @xmath68 , can be written in the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the neutrino magnetic moment , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the corresponding exact solutions of the equation ( [ new ] ) given by ( [ wave_function ] ) , and @xmath71+i\\gamma^{5}{\\bf \\sigma}\\big\\}.\\ ] ] here @xmath72 is the unit vector pointing the direction of the emitted photon propagation .",
    "note that the developed approach to the considered process in the presence of matter is similar to the furry representation in studies of quantum processes in external electromagnetic fields .    the integration in ( [ amplitude ] ) with respect to time yields @xmath73 where the delta - function stands for the energy conservation .",
    "performing the integrations over the spatial co - ordinates , we can recover the delta - functions for the three components of the momentum . finally , we get the law of the energy - momentum conservation for the considered process , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the energies of the initial and final neutrino states in matter . from ( [ e_m_con ] )",
    "it follows that the emitted photon energy @xmath77 exhibits the critical dependence on the helicities of the initial and final neutrino states . in the case of electron neutrino moving in matter composed of electrons @xmath78 is positive .",
    "thus , it follows that the only possibility for the @xmath0 to appear is provided in the case when the neutrino initial and final states are characterized by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . we conclude that in the considered process the relativistic left - handed neutrino is converted to the right - handed neutrino .",
    "a discussion on the main properties of the @xmath0 emitted by different flavour neutrinos moving in matter composed of electrons , protons and neutrons can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the emitted photon energy in the considered case ( @xmath81 ) obtained as an exact solution of the equations ( [ e_m_con ] ) reads @xmath82 } { \\left ( e-\\alpha m - p\\cos \\theta \\right ) ^{2}-\\left ( \\alpha m\\right ) ^{2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the angle between @xmath84 and the direction of the initial neutrino propagation .    in the case of not very high density of matter , when the parameter @xmath85 , we can expand the photon energy ( [ omega1 ] ) over the above mentioned parameter and in the liner approximation get the result of @xcite : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the neutrino speed in vacuum .",

    "we get @xmath106 in the opposite case @xmath102 we get @xmath107    note that the obtained @xmath0 rate and radiation power in the case @xmath100 for @xmath108 are in agreement with @xcite .    from the obtained expressions for the @xmath0 rate and total power it is possible to get an estimation for the emitted photons average energy : @xmath109    in the case @xmath100 we get @xmath110 in the opposite case @xmath102 for the emitted photons overage energy we have @xmath111",
    "we should like to note that for a wide range of the neutrino momentum @xmath60 and density parameter @xmath78 the @xmath0 power is collimated along the direction of the neutrino propagation .",
    "the form of the radiation power spatial distribution calculated with use of eq.([power ] ) in the case @xmath112 for low and high density of matter are shown in figs . 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "as it follows from these figures , the form of the distribution depends on the density of matter .",
    "the form of the spatial distribution of the radiation moves from the projector - like shape to the cap - like one with increase of the matter density . from ( [ power ] )",
    "we derive , that in the case of @xmath100 for a wide range of the matter densities , @xmath113 , the direction of the maximum in the spatial distribution of the radiation power is characterized by the angle @xmath114 it follows that in a dense matter the @xmath0 radiation in the direction of the initial neutrino motion is strongly suppressed , whereas there is a lighted ring on the plane perpendicular to the neutrino motion .",
    "the quantum calculation of the radiation power with the photon s circular polarization being accounted for ( see also @xcite ) shows another very important property of the @xmath0 in matter . in the limit of low matter density ,",
    "@xmath115 , we get for the power @xmath116 where @xmath117 corresponds to the right and left photon circular polarizations , respectively . in this limiting case",
    "the power of radiation of the left - polarized photons exceeds that of the right - polarized photons .",
    "in particular , this result is also valid for the non - relativistic case @xmath102 for low density with @xmath115 .",
    "it is remarkable that in the most interesting case of a rather dense matter ( @xmath108 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath102 ) , the main contribution to the power is provided by the right - polarized photons , whereas the emission of the left - polarized photons is suppressed : @xmath120 we conclude that in a dense matter the @xmath0 photons are emitted with nearly total right - circular polarization .",
    "finally , we should like to discuss in some detail restrictions on the propagation of the @xmath0 photons that are set by the presence of the background electron plasma in the case of @xmath100 for the density parameter @xmath121 . only the photons with energy that exceeds the plasmon frequency @xmath122 can propagate in the plasma ( here @xmath123 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath124 is the mass of the electron ) . from ( [ omega1 ] ) and ( [ angle_max ] ) it follows that , on the one hand , the photon s energy and the radiation power depend on the direction of the radiation . on the other hand",
    ", we can conclude that the maximal value of the photon s energy , @xmath125 and the energy the photon emitted in the direction of the maximum radiation power , @xmath126 are of the same order in the considered case .",
    "for the relativistic neutrino and rather dense matter the angle @xmath127 , at which the radiation power has its maximum , is very close to zero when the photon energy reaches the maximal value ( [ omega_max ] ) .",
    "therefore , the condition for the effective @xmath0 production and propagation through the plasma can be written in the form @xmath128 for @xmath129 we get @xmath130 .",
    "the investigated properties of the neutrino spin light in matter ( i.e. , the spatial distribution of the radiation power and the angular dependence of the emitted photon s energy , as well as nearly total circular polarization of the radiation ) might be important for the experimental identification of the @xmath0 from different astrophysical and cosmology objects and media .",
