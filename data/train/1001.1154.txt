    "a decade ago , astronomers discovered the expansion of the universe was accelerating via the cosmological dimming of distant supernovae  @xcite .",
    "since then , the combination of numerous , and diverse , experiments has helped to establish the cosmological constant ( specifically a @xmath4cdm model ) as the leading candidate to explain this cosmic acceleration . however , with no theoretical motivation to explain the required low energy vacuum of the @xmath4cdm model , there is no reason to preclude alternative models , especially those based upon the possible violation of fundamental physics which have yet to be proven on cosmological scales  @xcite .",
    "in addition to using geometrical probes like supernovae to constrain the cosmic acceleration , tests based on the formation of structures in the universe also provide a method for validating our cosmological models .",
    "in particular , we can investigate the consistency between the geometrical expansion history of the universe and the evolution of local density inhomogeneities to help reveal a deeper understanding of the nature of the cosmic acceleration  @xcite .    in general",
    ", there are three observables that can be used to quantify structure formation in the universe , namely geometrical perturbations , energy  momentum fluctuations and peculiar velocities ,",
    "all of which will be measured to high precision via future experiments like des , lsst , jdem and euclid ( see details of these experiments in the recent fomswg report  @xcite ) . in more detail ,",
    "such weak lensing experiments measure the integrated geometrical effect on light as its trajectory is bent by the gravitational potential .",
    "likewise , galaxies ( and clusters of galaxies ) measure the correlations amongst large  scale local inhomogeneities , while the observed distortions in these correlations ( in redshift  space ) can be used to extract information about peculiar velocities  @xcite . in this paper , we explore the cosmological constraints on the physics of cosmic acceleration using peculiar velocities , as it is one of the key quantities required for a consistency test of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "early observational studies of the peculiar velocity field , or ",
    "bulk flows \" , have produced for many years discrepant results  @xcite , primarily due to small sample sizes and the heterogeneous selection of galaxies .",
    "however , a recent re - analysis of these earlier surveys  @xcite has now provided a consistent observational picture from these data and finds significant evidence for a larger than expected bulk motion .",
    "this is consistent with new measurements of the bulk motion of clusters of galaxies using a completely different methodology@xcite , which leads to the intriguing situation that all these measurements appear to be significantly greater in amplitude , and scale , than expected in a concordance , wmap5normalised @xmath4cdm cosmological model .",
    "such discrepancies with @xmath4cdm may give support to exotic cosmological models like modified gravity  @xcite .",
    "given the importance of these large  scale bulk flow measurements , we propose here an alternative methodology to help check these recent claims of anomalously high peculiar velocities which are inconsistent with the standard @xmath4cdm cosmology .",
    "we start by outlining a statistical determination of bulk flow motions using redshift ",
    "space distortions in large - scale galaxy or cluster surveys .",
    "such redshift - space distortions are easily seen in the two  dimensional correlation function ( @xmath7 ) , which is the decomposition of the correlation function into two vectors ; one parallel ( @xmath8 ) to the line  of  sight and the other perpendicular ( @xmath9 ) to the line  of  sight . on small scales , any incoherent velocities of galaxies within a single dark matter halo ( or cluster ) will just add to the cosmological hubble flow thus causing the famous ",
    "fingers - of - god \" ( fog ) effect which stretches the 2-d correlation function preferentially in line - of - sight ( @xmath8 ) direction .",
    "these distortions depend on the inner dynamics and structure of halos and therefore , any cosmological information is difficult to distinguish from the halo properties .",
    "however , on large scales ( outside individual dark matter halos ) , the peculiar velocities become coherent and follow the linear motion of the matter thus providing crucial information on the formation of large - scale structure  @xcite .    in this paper , we compare predictions for @xmath10 to observations based on the c4 cluster catalogue  @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  @xcite . using the kaiser formulation  @xcite , a theoretical model for @xmath10 is fit to the measured 2-d correlation function in configuration  space , with the @xmath11 parameterised by a shape dependent part and a coherent evolution component .",
    "we also propose that the 1-d linear velocity dispersion ( @xmath0 ) is a interesting quantity to report when measuring redshift  space distortions , and complementary to traditional quantities like @xmath12 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 discussed recently  @xcite , as it is independent of both bias and the normalisation method .",
    "therefore , the measured @xmath0 provides an unbiased tracer of the evolution of structure formation .",
    "the redshift  space two - point correlation function of mass tracers ( @xmath7 ) is an anisotropic function  @xcite . on small scales ,",
    "it is elongated in the @xmath8-direction by the  fingers - of - god \" effect , while on large scales , the gravitational infall into overdense regions preferentially compresses the correlation function in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "therefore , peculiar velocities can be statistically measured by analyzing the observed anisotropic pattern of @xmath7 in both the linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "@xmath7 is derived from the convolution of @xmath15 with a probability distribution function of peculiar velocities along the line of sight , which is usually called the streaming model  @xcite .",
    "even with the simplest form of a gaussian probability distribution , the streaming model describes the suppression effect on @xmath7 on small scales .    in the linear regime",
    ", the density fluctuations and peculiar velocity are coherently evolved through the continuity equation , which is known as the kaiser limit .",
    "thus the known correlation function of @xmath15 from the linear perturbation theory developed by gravitational instability is uniquely transformed into @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the large scale limit of the streaming model is consistent with the kaiser limit  @xcite , when both the density and peculiar velocity fields are treated as statistical quantities  @xcite .",
    "this consistency test was developed further to show that , even in the kaiser limit , the description of @xmath7 in linear theory can be modified due to the correlation between the `` squashing '' ( in the @xmath9 direction ) and dispersion effects ( in the @xmath8 direction )  @xcite . with the assumption of a gaussian pair - wise velocity distribution function , the dispersion effect smears into the kaiser limit description of @xmath7 at around the percent level which for our present work can be ignored .",
    "thus we adopt the kaiser limit for the description of @xmath7 in linear regime while considering dispersion effect as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "we introduce below a new parameterisation of @xmath7 in terms of the cosmological parameters and construct a method to measure the mean velocity dispersion @xmath0 in a model independent way .",
    "= 3.0truein = 3.0truein    the discovery of cosmic acceleration has prompted rapid progress in theoretical cosmological research and prompted many authors to propose modification to the law of gravity beyond our solar system .",
    "for example , some theories based upon general relativity can be modified by screening ( or anti - screening ) the mass of gravitationally bound objects  @xcite , while others include a non - trivial dark energy component ( e.g. interacting dark energy  @xcite , or clumping dark energy  @xcite ) thus breaking the dynamical relations between density fluctuations and peculiar velocity in the simplest dark energy models .",
    "these theoretical ideas motivate us to express various power spectra of the density field in a more convenient way to test such theories .",
    "we assume a standard cosmology model for epochs earlier than the last scattering surface , and that the coherent evolution of structure formation from the last scattering surface to the present day is undetermined due to new physics relevant to the cosmic acceleration .",
    "thus we divide the history of structure formation into two regimes ; epochs before matter - radiation equality ( @xmath16 ) and a later epoch of coherent evolution of unknown effect on structure formation from new physics.we can then express various power spectra of the density field splits into these two epochs , with the shape - dependent part determined by knowledge of our standard cosmology , and the coherent evolution part only affected by new physics .",
    "mathematically , this is written as , p_(k , a)&=&d_(k)g_^2(a ) , + p_bb(k , a)&=&d_m(k)g_b^2(a ) , + p__m_m(k , a)&=&d_m(k)g__m^2(a ) , where @xmath17 denotes the curvature perturbation in the newtonian gauge , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denotes the map of the re - scaled divergence of peculiar velocity @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "these power spectra are then partitioned into a scale  dependent part ( @xmath22 ) and a scale - independent ( coherent evolution ) component ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "we define here @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the standard linear bias parameter between galaxy ( or cluster ) tracers and the underlying dark matter density .",
    "the shape of the power spectra is determined before the epoch of matter  radiation equality . under the paradigm of inflationary theory ,",
    "initial fluctuations are stretched outside the horizon at different epochs which generates the tilt in the power spectrum .",
    "the predicted initial tilting is parameterised as a spectral index ( @xmath28 ) which is just the shape dependence due to the initial condition .",
    "when the initial fluctuations reach the coherent evolution epoch after matter - radiation equality , they experience a scale - dependent shift from the moment they re - enter the horizon to the equality epoch .",
    "gravitational instability is governed by the interplay between radiative pressure resistance and gravitational infall .",
    "the different duration of modes during this period results in a secondary shape dependence on the power spectrum .",
    "this shape dependence is determined by the ratio between matter and radiation energy densities and sets the location of the matter - radiation equality in the time coordinate .",
    "as the radiation energy density is precisely measured by the cmb blackbody spectrum , these secondary shape dependences are parameterised by the matter energy density @xmath29 .",
    "both of these parameters are now well  determined by cmb experiments .",
    "the shape factor of the perturbed metric power spectra @xmath30 is defined as d_(k)=^2__0(k)t^2_(k ) which is a dimensionless metric power spectra at @xmath16 , where @xmath31 is the initial fluctuations in the comoving gauge and @xmath32 is transfer function normalized at @xmath33 . the primordial shape @xmath31 depends on @xmath28 , as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the amplitude of the initial comoving fluctuations at the pivot scale , @xmath36 .",
    "the intermediate shape factor @xmath32 depends on @xmath37 .",
    "the shape factor for matter fluctuations and peculiar velocities @xmath38 are given by the conversion from @xmath30 of , d_m(k)d_(k ) , where @xmath39 .",
    "unlike the shape part , the coherent evolution component , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not generally parameterized by known standard cosmological parameters .",
    "we thus normalize these growth factors at @xmath16 such that , g_(a_eq)&=&1 , + g__m(a_eq)&=&a_eqg_(a_eq ) , + g__m(a_eq)&=&- . instead of determining growth factors using cosmological parameters , we measure these directly in a model - independent way at",
    "the given redshift without referencing to any specific cosmic acceleration model and with the minimal assumption of coherent evolution of modes after @xmath16 .",
    "considering the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath40 from the cmb anisotropy , which is degenerate with the optical depth of re - ionization , we combine both @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 denotes each component of @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath19 ) with proper scaling for convenience as @xmath43 . throughout this paper , we use @xmath44 for the mean @xmath40 value from the wmap5 results .",

    "in addition to this contribution , the overall amplitude of @xmath47 depends on @xmath37 by a weighted transformation between @xmath30 and @xmath38 . considering the marginalisation over cmb priors",

    "the overall shifting can be re - scaled by adjusting the pivot point to the effective median scale of the survey . with the measured wmap5",
    "prior of @xmath54  @xcite , we expect variations of a few percent on the shape , while for an estimated planck prior of @xmath55  @xcite , we expect @xmath47 to be nearly invariant to @xmath28 .",
    "the shape of @xmath47 is affected maximally during the intermediate epoch , from horizon crossing to the matter - radiation epoch .",
    "the decay rate of the inhomogeneities differs by the ratio between matter and radiation energy densities .    once cmb constraints are placed on the shape part of eqn .",
    "6 , the coherent history of structure formation is obtained from the anisotropic moment of @xmath7 . even though both @xmath50 and @xmath51 weight the evolution sector simultaneously , their contribution to @xmath7 are different , which enables us to discriminate @xmath51 from @xmath50 . in the monopole moment , @xmath50 is the dominant component since @xmath56 unless their is an excessive bulk flow .",

    "<S> this measurement does not lend support to recent claims of excessive bulk motions ( @xmath6 km / s ) which appear in conflict with @xmath4cdm , although our large statistical error can not rule them out . from the measured coherent evolution of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a technique to re - construct the perturbed potential , as well as estimating the unbiased matter density fluctuations and scale  independent bias . </S>"
