    "energy spectra beyond 60 kev are now well determined only for the hardest and strongest sources in the sky . for most objects , even for the most powerful , above 70 - 80 kev the spectra are scarcely known ( see examples in fig .",
    "[ f : herx1 ] , fig .",
    "[ f : mkn3 ] ) .",
    "however the @xmath360 kev energy channel is crucial to study many open issues of high energy astrophysics . among them , we wish to mention the following :    * the physics in presence of super - strong magnetic fields ( mass accreting x - ray pulsars , anomalous x - ray pulsars , soft gamma  ray repeaters ) ; * high energy cut - offs of bh binaries and , more generally , high energy tails of compact x  ray binaries ( low and high mass ) ; * study of the hard x/soft gamma - ray emission level from low and high mass x  ray binaries in quiescence ; * the role of inverse compton with respect to synchrotron or thermal processes in grbs . * the role of non thermal mechanisms in extended objects ( supernova remnants , galaxy clusters ) . * high energy cut - offs in the spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . * the origin of the high energy cosmic x-/gamma - ray background ( cxb ) . synthesis models ( see , e.g. , fig .  [",
    "f : cxb ] ) require a spectral roll - over with an e - folding energy of 100 - 400 kev in agn .",
    "so far only a few sparse measurements of these sources , mainly with are available .",
    "it can not be excluded that a new source population , with a cut - off clustered around 100 - 400 kev , is responsible for the observed cxb spectrum .",
    "much more sensitive observations than those performed with   at hard x  ray energies are urgent . *",
    "nuclear ( e.g. , @xmath4ti ) and annihilation ( 511 kev ) lines .",
    "a more extended discussion of these issues was given in the proposal submitted in response to the esa call for ideas for cosmic vision 20152025 `` exploring the hard x/gamma  ray continuum sky at unprecedented sensitivity '' by frontera et al . ) .",
    "results of a feasibility study of a laue lens with broad energy bandpass ( typically 60600 kev ) have already been reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "the technique adopted is bragg diffraction from mosaic crystals .",
    "the geometrical configuration of the lens ( see fig .  [",
    "f : lens ] ) is spherical , with sphere radius equal to 2 times the focal length @xmath5 .",
    "the lens is covered by mosaic crystal tiles with sizes as small as possible ( e.g. , @xmath6  mm@xmath7 or less ) .",
    "the crystal tiles are positioned in the lens according to an archimedes spiral . in fig .",
    "[ f : lens_pm ] we show an example of this crystal tile disposition for a lens prototype which we are currently developing ( see below ) .",
    "the archimedes spiral geometry allows a smooth dependence of the lens effective area with energy .",
    "the size of the lens and thus its effective area scales with the square of the focal length .",
    "the adopted material is cu  ( 111 ) , which we can produce with a mosaic structure of angular spread @xmath8  arcmin ( fwhm ) .",
    "reflectivity test results ( see example in fig .  [",
    "f : tests ] ) performed on samples of cu  ( 111 ) are consistent with the theoretical expectations ( @xcite ) . a hard x  ray facility ( larix ) for testing the laue lenses",
    "is also being developed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the development of a demonstration model ( dm ) is now in progress .",
    "it consists of 30 tiles of cu  ( 111 ) mosaic crystal with 5 arcmin ( fwhm ) mosaic spread and @xmath9  mm@xmath7 cross section .",
    "the goal is to establish the crystal assembling technique . the development of a prototype model ( pm ) with 500 crystals and 210 cm @xmath5 is already scheduled as the next step",
    ". the nominal energy band of the pm will be from 60 to 200 kev .",
    "in addition to the laboratory tests , the pm is also expected to be tested in a balloon flight .    the focal plane detector required for the laue lenses should have a high detection efficiency in the entire range of operation of the lenses ( almost all focussed gamma ",
    "rays should be detected ) , a spatial resolution @xmath10  mm , an energy resolution ( fwhm ) @xmath11  kev at 500 kev for the study of the nuclear and annihilation lines , and a detector sensitive to the photon linear polarization .",
    "the polarization sensitivity is a key requirement given that most of the emission processes of gamma  ray radiation in the source classes mentioned in section 1 are expected to partially produce polarized photons .",
    "in order to show the expected capabilities of laue lenses in the hard x-/soft gamma - ray band , we report here two possible configurations of multi - lens telescopes .    1 .   * configuration 1 * ( see fig .  [",
    "f : conf1 ] ) with a focal length of 15 m and a nominal energy passband from 1 to 600 kev .",
    "it includes : * 1 low energy lens ( lel ) with a nominal passband from 54 to 200 kev ; * 4 high energy lenses ( hel ) with a nominal passband from 150 to 600 kev ; * in the hole left free from the lel , a wolter i multi - layer ( ml ) optics , confocal with the latter , to cover the 1 - 80 kev energy band ; 2 .   * configuration 2 * ( see fig .  [",
    "f : conf2 ] ) with a nominal passband from 1 to 900 kev .",
    "it includes : * 1 low energy lens ( lel ) with a nominal 54 - 200 kev passband ; * 4 high energy lenses ( hel ) with a nominal 150 - 600 kev passband ; * 1 nuclear line lens ( nll ) devoted to specifically study nuclear lines in the two energy bands : 450 - 540 and 800 - 900 kev ; * in the hole left free from the nll , a wolter i multi - layer ( ml ) optics ( not shown ) , confocal with the latter , complements the lenses to cover the 1 - 80 kev energy band .    in configuration 2 , ml mirrors and lel and hel lenses",
    "are assumed to have a focal length of 20 m and a mosaic spread of 2 arcmin , while the nll lens is assumed to have a focal length of 80 m. the inconvenience of the very high focal lengths ( @xmath12 m ) is their requirement for a very small spread ( @xmath13  arcmin ) of the mosaic crystals , which is now much more difficult to produce .",
    "lens configurations with one single focal length are being investigated .",
    "a ray tracing code devoted to study the optical properties of the laue lenses for offset incident beams is also in progress .    in figs .",
    "[ f : sens1 ] and [ f : sens2 ] we show the expected @xmath14 sensitivity of the multi - lens configurations 1 and 2 ( only lel and hel ) , in which a crystal thickness of 2  mm for the lel and 4  mm for the hels was assumed . the crystal thicknesses can be further optimized to increase the lens sensitivity .",
    "note that the lel sensitivity can also be improved increasing its diameter .",
    "the exposure time is assumed to be @xmath15  s , while the band width is @xmath16 .",
    "the detection efficiency is @xmath17 .    in configuration 2 ,",
    "the expected hel sensitivity to a 511 kev annihilation line of 3 kev fwhm , is @xmath18  photons  @xmath1  s@xmath2 .",
    "laue lenses appear to be a promising approach in order to overcome significantly ( even by 2 orders of magnitude , depending on energy ) the sensitivity limitations of the current generation of direct - viewing telescopes , with or without coded masks .",
    "we have shown two examples of multi - lens configurations capable to cover the 60 to 600 kev band with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "we acknowledge the financial support received from the italian space agency asi for this project in 2001 and 2002 .",
    "we wish also to thank for their contribution to the dm development t. franceschini and s. silvestri ."
