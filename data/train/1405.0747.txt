    "stability analysis is a very crucial topic in systems theory .",
    "there are different kinds of stability problems ( e.g : stability of equilibrium points , stability of periodic orbits , input - output stability etc . ) that arise in the study of dynamical systems .",
    "stability of the equilibrium points of an autonomous system is characterized using lyapunov theory .",
    "existence of a lyapunov function is a sufficient condition for stability of an equilibrium point of an autonomous system .",
    "however for a large class of autonomous systems , finding a lyapunov function may not be an easy task .",
    "+ in case of linear systems , the problem of finding a lyapunov function reduces to solving a simple linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) ; and hence there is a systematic way to find a lyapunov function .",
    "also in case of electrical and mechanical systems , there are natural lyapunov function candidates in terms of physical energy functions @xcite .",
    "however in general for non - linear systems , there is no systematic method to find a lyapunov function @xcite . in theory",
    "there is a variable gradient method ; but for many autonomous systems , the variable gradient method is extremely difficult to apply .",
    "+ in @xcite a technique is given for an algorithmic construction of a lyapunov function for non - linear autonomous systems , with polynomial vector fields , using semidefinite programming and sum of squares decomposition .",
    "in @xcite this technique is extended to include systems with non - polynomial vector fields , which can be transformed to an equivalent system with polynomial vector fields under equality and inequality constraints on the state variables .",
    "unfortunately these techniques are limited to only certain class of autonomous systems . in general , it is numerically difficult to check the conditions to be satisfied by a lyapunov candidate and a lyapunov function .",
    "checking positive definiteness of simple polynomial functions is also an np - hard problem when polynomial has degree @xmath4 or higher @xcite .",
    "+ checking the global asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point of a nonlinear autonomous system is a more difficult problem than checking stability or asymptotic stability of an equilibrium point .",
    "this is because while checking the global asymptotic stability , one can not use the technique of local linearization about an equilibrium point . in this paper",
    ", we provide a necessary condition in terms of a local minima of the @xmath5 function ( to be defined later in section-[h - function ] ) that every lyapunov function @xmath1 , corresponding to the globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of @xmath0 , must satisfy . as this necessary condition on a lyapunov function does not involve system dynamics , it is easier to check .",
    "moreover , since every lyapunov function corresponding to the globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of @xmath0 has to satisfy this condition , the set of valid lyapunov function candidates becomes much smaller .",
    "this would naturally benefit any method of finding a lyapunov function corresponding to the globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of @xmath0 .",
    "+ for the global asymptotic stability analysis of an equilibrium point , the necessary condition obtained from the theorem [ chimu ] can be used as a first level test for a lyapunov function candidate . note that , this first level test is based on the generalized steepest descent method given in section-[huer ] , and is easier to check than checking positive definiteness of a function .",
    "therefore , the computationally more intensive positive definiteness check can be spared for functions which fail to satisfy this first level test . the generalized steepest descent method given in section-[huer ]",
    "can also be used as a heuristic to check the local positive definiteness of a function , which is a well known necessary condition for a lyapunov function corresponding to a stable and/or asymptotically stable equilibrium point of an autonomous system . +",
    "while tackling the problem of finding a lyapunov function to conclude the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point , one obvious start is by employing continuously differentiable and coercive functions which can be written as sum of squares . in order to conclude that a function in the above class is a lyapunov function , one needs to check that the time derivative of this function along system trajectories is negative definite , which is again numerically very difficult . with our proposed necessary condition , the set of functions on which this negative definiteness condition ( involving system dynamics ) needs to be checked can be drastically reduced . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section-[not - pre ] , we explain notations and some preliminaries . lyapunov theory and lasalle s invariance principle are described in brief in section-[lpv - theory ] . in section-[h - function ] , we define the @xmath5 function which will be used later to state our necessary condition .",
    "we state and prove our main result in section-[main - result ] , which gives a necessary condition for a lyapunov function @xmath1 corresponding to the globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point . in section-[huer ] , we explain the generalized steepest descent method to check the necessary condition obtained from theorem [ chimu ] .",
    "this method is useful for numerically ruling out some lyapunov function candidates corresponding to the global asymptotic stability .",
    "we also give some examples to demonstrate usefulness of our necessary condition .",
