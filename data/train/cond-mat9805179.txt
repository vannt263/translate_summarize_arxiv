    "the mixing of a scalar field @xmath0 in a velocity field @xmath1 is governed by the advection - diffusion equation , @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is a diffusion constant and @xmath4 is an external source of scalar .",
    "the velocity field is determined independently of the scalar field ( hence the adjective _ passive _ ) and ( in this discussion ) is incompressible ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the incompressible flow simply transports the scalar , without changing any of the scalar s values .",
    "the diffusion term smooths the resulting scalar differences , while the source term generates new scalar to compensate for this smoothing .",
    "the mixing of a scalar field @xmath0 is characterized experimentally by its structure functions , defined as @xmath6 for positive integers @xmath7 .",
    "it has been established experimentally that passive scalar structure functions are scaling functions of @xmath8 over a wide range of length scales when the advecting flow is turbulent .",
    "this range of length scales , known as the inertial range , extends from a macroscale ( usually determined by the flow geometry ) down to a dissipative cut - off scale .",
    "the lower end of the inertial scaling range is set either by the viscous scale of the velocity field ( the scale where viscosity damps out the fluid motion ) or by the scalar s dissipation scale ( the scale where molecular diffusivity damps out scalar fluctuations ) .",
    "the ratio of these length scales , known as the prandtl number , is a material property of the system .",
    "this work will focus exclusively on systems in which the molecular diffusivity imposes the lower bound on the inertial range ( prandtl number less than one ) .",
    "in such systems the size of the inertial range is measured by the peclet number , defined as the ratio of the macroscale to the dissipation scale .",
    "the inertial range scaling exponents @xmath9 , defined by @xmath10 , are measured experimentally .",
    "the simplest possible prediction is based on the belief that the scalar difference between two points separated by a distance @xmath8 will typically have a magnitude @xmath11 which scales with @xmath8 , @xmath12 ( for some @xmath13 ) .",
    "this implies @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the scaling exponents satisfy @xmath15 , which is known as ` regular scaling . '",
    "experimentally , the exponents are seen to exhibit ` anomalous scaling , ' @xmath16 .",
    "such scaling indicates that there is no typical magnitude for @xmath11 , and this wide variation in magnitudes is known as _",
    "multiscaling_. experimentally , measured scaling indices for passive scalars in turbulent flows are quite anomalous . @xcite",
    "until recently , relatively little attention was paid to this observed anomalous scaling in the passive scalar field .",
    "this is perhaps because the phenomena had often been attributed to anomalous scaling of the underlying velocity field .",
    "however , a model proposed by robert kraichnan @xcite suggests that a hypothetical regular - scaling velocity field would still generate anomalous scaling in the scalar structure functions .",
    "in addition , the scaling exponents would be universal , independent of details such as the geometry of the flow . in this model ,",
    "the passive scalar is advected by a stochastic velocity field with regular scaling in space but with an extremely short correlation time .",
    "it is possible to form equations for the structure functions in this model , provided a closure assumption is made .",
    "the proposed closure @xcite @xcite leads to structure functions which scale with @xmath8 , but with scaling exponents @xmath9 which grow like @xmath17 rather than @xmath7 .",
    "others , however , have applied different techniques to the same model ( avoiding a closure ansatz ) and claim to have found different results .",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite a review of the disagreement is given by shraiman and siggia .",
    "@xcite    to study this closure ansatz and the passive scalar structure functions numerically , i use a one - dimensional model @xcite in which the structure functions @xmath18 obey statistical equations with the same closure problem as in kraichnan s model .",
    "the model is simple enough to allow direct numerical study of the structure function scaling ( over 2 orders of magnitude in the separation @xmath8 ) and the proposed closure ansatz . mixing occurs through a random mapping function chosen to mimic an incompressible flow and induce scaling in the structure functions . because it is restricted to one dimension , the model is best viewed as representing scalar mixing in a turbulent pipe flow .    in this model",
    "the second order structure function can be determined analytically . for large peclet number it scales with @xmath8 with a scaling exponent @xmath19 determined by the advective mapping function .",
    "the higher order structure functions @xmath20 also scale ( numerically ) , with exponents @xmath9 which appear to approach a constant value at large @xmath7 .",
    "the closure ansatz proposed by kraichnan is seen to fail in numerical simulations of this model .",
    "the source of this failure can be traced to the finite size of the largest mixing events .",
    "this upper length scale is analogous to the largest eddy size in a fluid flow ( in a pipe this size is determined by the pipe diameter ) .",
    "very large scalar differences can not be produced by a single mixing event , but instead arise from the combined action of several events .",
    "for this reason large scalar differences are exponentially improbable .",
    "deviations from the closure ansatz are observed only for these large scalar differences .",
    "however , the behavior of the large @xmath7 structure functions is determined by these rare events . in this model",
    "the scaling exponents approach a constant at large @xmath7 , in contrast to the @xmath21 behavior predicted for kraichnan s model .",
    "in addition , the value of the constant might depend on the largest eddy size , so that the large @xmath7 behavior of the exponents would be geometry dependent .",
    "because these conclusions rest primarily on the fact that the largest mixing events are much smaller than the system size , one might expect them to be independent of the details of the small - scale mixing process .",
    "mixing in a turbulent pipe flow should exhibit this separation of length scales , and there is some experimental evidence to support the idea that large scalar differences are exponentially unlikely in such a flow .",
    "@xcite      robert kraichnan first introduced the ` white - advected ' passive scalar model in 1968 @xcite , and introduced the anomalous - scaling solution in a pair of recent papers .",

    "this scaling in space holds until @xmath8 approaches some large correlation length @xmath27 , representing the largest motions in the system .",
    "the scaling correlation in space is similar to real turbulent flows , while the very short range of temporal correlations is unphysical but desirable for technical reasons .",
    "the velocity statistics are chosen to be gaussian , so higher order velocity structure functions can be expressed in terms of this second order function .",
    "consequently , the velocity structure functions exhibit regular scaling , and so any anomalous scaling found in the passive scalar structure functions must arise from the structure of the scalar advection - diffusion equation and not from the underlying velocity scaling .",

    "its correlations are specified by @xmath28 the spatial function @xmath29 is assumed to be smooth , so that @xmath30 for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the correlation length of the source field .",

    "the dissipation function @xmath46 can be evaluated by commuting derivatives with @xmath47 and with the averaging process @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 the mean - squared scalar dissipation @xmath50 is constant , and can be determined by balancing against the scalar source ( since the flux of scalar is conserved ) . at very large separations",
    "@xmath51 , the source correlation vanishes ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 must approach a constant .",

    "can then be re - cast as @xmath55 assumming @xmath30 .",
    "the two differential operators which act on @xmath53 possess different scalings .",
    "the length scale at which the operators are equal is defined as the dissipation scale , @xmath56 : @xmath57 the upper limit of the inertial ( scaling ) range is set by the lesser of the two macroscales , @xmath32 and @xmath27 . in the inertial range ( @xmath58 ) , the second operator can be neglected , and the solution is approximately @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the second - order scaling exponent . alternately , in the dissipation range ( @xmath61 )",
    ", the first operator can be neglected , and the solution is approximately @xmath62    there are two possible approaches for determining the higher order scaling exponents .",
    "the first is to balance the eddy - diffusivity operator against the forcing term .",
    "if the @xmath63-th structure function has scaling exponent @xmath9 , then the corresponding eddy - diffusivity term scales with @xmath8 with the scaling exponent @xmath64 .",
    "the source term has scaling @xmath65 . if these terms are equal ( _ i.e. _ if @xmath66 is negligible ) then the scaling exponents are given by @xmath67 , which is regular scaling .",
    "the other possibility , first proposed by kraichnan @xcite , is to balance the eddy - diffusivity operator against the dissipation term @xmath66 .",
    "this basically assumes that the dominant scaling is set not by the source term , but by a homogeneous solution ( or _ zero mode _ ) of the structure function equations .",
    "consequently , the scaling could be _ universal _ , independent of the details of the source term .",
    "unfortunately , evaluation of the @xmath66 requires a closure ansatz stating how the laplacian of the scalar field at two distinct points , @xmath68 depends on the scalar difference @xmath69 between those points .",
    "the proposed closure ansatz is best understood in terms of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for scalar differences @xmath70 .",

    "the structure functions @xmath20 are the moments of this pdf : @xmath71 the unknown closure information is expressed in the conditional probability @xmath72 which gives the ensemble - averaged value of @xmath68 subject to the constraint that the scalar difference between the two points take on the particular value @xmath47 .",
    "the dissipation functions can be expressed using @xmath73 and the pdf for scalar differences @xmath70 : @xmath74 the closure ansatz proposed in @xcite is that @xmath73 is approximately a linear function of @xmath47 : @xmath75 with some unknown slope @xmath76 .",
    "this assumption can be viewed as a truncation of the taylor series expansion of @xmath77 ( by symmetry , the series has only odd terms ) . by substitution , the dissipation functions are @xmath78 .",

    "unfortunately , it is not possible to consider higher order corrections to the taylor series for @xmath77 because the resulting equations for @xmath18 can not be solved .",
    "however , others have approached the model using techniques which avoid the need for a closure ansatz and , in certain limits , have found values of @xmath9 which disagree with kraichnan s result .",
    "the competing approach to determining scaling exponents in this model focuses on the @xmath7-point correlation functions of the scalar ( known as @xmath7th order moments ) , defined as @xmath85 the @xmath7th order structure function can be expressed in terms of the corresponding moment by allowing points to fuse together .",
    "the moments convey more information than the structure functions and can be viewed as the more fundamental objects , but moments are generally not measured experimentally .",

    "hopf _ equations ) .",
    "there is no closure problem associated with the dissipative terms .",

    "several groups have assumed an overall scaling for the @xmath7th order moment when all separations lie within the inertial range , and then attempted to calculate the scaling exponent in certain limits using perturbation theory . in each case",
    "it is assumed that the dominant contribution comes from a zero mode of the hopf equation .",
    "these exponents differ from the structure function scaling exponents proposed by kraichnan .",

    "unfortunately , the huge difference in approach makes it difficult to ascertain the source of the disagreement .",
    "another limit in which a descrepancy was found is the limit of large space dimension ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "@xcite @xcite in this case the scaling is again nearly regular , with a small correction in @xmath95 .",
    "the corresponding limit of equation [ kraexp ] is also regular , but the correction term differs from that obtained from the hopf equation calculation .    one proposed reconcilliation between these calculations is a generalization of kraichnan s closure based on the ` fusion rules . '",

    "consequently , a one - dimensional scalar field is preferable",
    ". however , a one - dimensional incompressible velocity field would be quite dull , so we are forced to choose some other form of mixing that retains certain traits of an incompressible flow .",
    "the attribute preserved in this model is that the mixing simply re - arranges the scalar field , without altering any scalar values .",
    "any advection of this type will necessarily be non - local .",
    "the particular method of re - arrangement is based on a picture of a turbulent flow consisting of many swirling eddies , and is constructed to induce scaling in the passive scalar structure functions . because the model is one - dimensional , it is best thought of as being analogous physically to a turbulent pipe flow .",

    "@xcite    the model is designed to produce structure functions which obey statistical equations with the same form as equation [ stateq ] .",
    "the dissipation functions @xmath66 are identical , so that the closure problem is reproduced , but the eddy - diffusity operator @xmath38 is altered ( although it remains a scaling operator ) .",

    "in particular , the separation of length scales ( between the largest eddy size and the system size ) required for exponential tails in the scalar difference pdf can be achieved in pipe flow .",
    "the finite diameter of the pipe limits velocity eddies to this size , while the pipe itself can be much longer ( analogous to this one - dimensional model ) .",
    "the mixing in the eddy model at small scales is quite different from real flows , but the likelihood of transport across distances larger than @xmath27 ( analogous to the pipe diameter ) could be similar ( statistically ) to real pipes .",
    "this suggests that , for large @xmath7 , the scaling exponents in pipe flows would approach a constant value .",
    "further , since the slope of the pdf tails depends on the pipe diameter ( @xmath222 ) , this value might be geometry - dependent .",
    "recent experiments on pipe flows @xcite have revealed pdf s of scalar values with exponential tails .",
    "no attempt has been made to study scalar differences , but the arguments of the previous chapter suggest that exponential tails in the scalar value pdf would imply exponential tails in the scalar difference pdf . if true , this would force structure function scaling exponents in turbulent pipe flow to approach a constant ( non - universal ) value at large @xmath7",
    ".    flows in other geometries ( such as a box , for example ) , would not be expected to display this effect .",
    "if the largest velocity eddy is comparable to the system size , large - scale mixing can occur under the correlated motion of a single large eddy , and the mechanism for generating exponential tails in the pdf would not exist .",
    "hence there is no reason to expect that scaling exponents @xmath9 would approach a constant at large @xmath7 in such geometries . the structure function scaling exponents of the passive scalar might therefore be geometry - dependent , with pipes exhibiting a different large @xmath7 asymptotic behavior than more open flow geometries .",
