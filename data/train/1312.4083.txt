    ", a generalized convolution is a binary associative operation @xmath0 on probability measures such that the convolution of point - mass measures @xmath1 can be a nondegenerate probability measure , while the usual convolution gives @xmath2 .",
    "the study of weakly stable distributions , initiated by kucharczak and urbanik ( see @xcite ) and followed by a series of papers by urbanik , kucharczak , panorska , and volkovich ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , provided a new and rich class of weak generalized convolutions on @xmath3 ( called also @xmath4-generalized convolutions ) .",

    "for additional information on generalized convolutions and weakly stable laws , see @xcite .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive theory of generalized and weak generalized convolutions and discuss the related classes of infinitely divisible distributions .",
    "we construct lvy and additive processes with respect to such convolutions .",
    "lvy process with respect to generalized convolutions form interesting subclasses of markov processes , such as the class of bessel processes in the case of kingman s convolution ( see @xcite ) , but in general , they are heavy tailed markov processes ( see remark  [ h - tail ] )",
    ". then we construct stochastic integrals of deterministic functions associated with such convolutions and the corresponding lvy processes .",
    "we also introduce the weak summability property of generalized convolutions .",
    "if a convolution admits the weak summability , then the stochastic integration theory related to such convolutions becomes more explicit and concrete .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we give definitions and properties of generalized and weak generalized convolutions that will be used throughout this work .",
    "we also provide an extensive list of examples . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we recall main results on infinite divisibility with respect to generalized and weak generalized convolutions .",
    "this information is crucial for further considerations .",
    "the main result of section  [ sec4 ] states that under minimal assumptions on generalized convolutions an analog of processes with independent increments can be constructed .",
    "we follow and extend an approach of n. van thu @xcite . in section  [ sec5 ] , we consider stochastic integral processes with respect to generalized convolutions .",
    "section  [ sec6 ] is devoted to the property of weak generalized summation . in section  [ sec7 ]",
    ", we construct `` independently scattered '' random measures based on a weak generalized summation ; these measures are used in section  [ sec8 ] to construct lvy and additive processes .",
