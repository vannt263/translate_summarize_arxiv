    "<S> functional renormalisation group approach is applied to a system of kaons at finite chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> a set of approximate flow equations for the effective couplings is derived and solved . at high scale </S>",
    "<S> the system is found to be at the normal phase whereas at some critical value of the running scale it undergoes the phase transition ( pt ) to the phase with a spontaneously broken symmetry with the kaon condensate as an order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the condensate turns out to be quite sensitive to the kaon - kaon scattering length .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of phase structure of dense hadron matter is one of the key problems of the strong interaction physics described by qcd . at low energy </S>",
    "<S> the qcd can be reduced to an effective theory containing goldstone bosons as effective degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of this effective theory to finite density requires taking into consideration nonzero isospin / strange chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the physical motivation for such an extension is provided by a wide range of phenomenon occurring in heavy - ion collisions and the equation of state ( eos ) of the neutron stars @xcite . at finite density </S>",
    "<S> these bosons may condense . </S>",
    "<S> this condensation shows up in a variety of the physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there is a strong possibility that a kaon condensation may exist in a core of the neutron stars so that a realistic analysis of such possibility as well as estimates of the value of the condensate may turn out to be important for establishing correct eos . </S>",
    "<S> it is rather well known that , depending on the value of the chemical potential , the following phases can be realised : normal phase with the trivial vacuum , pion condensation / kaon condensation . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the kaon condensation which will be studied in the framework of the functional renormalisation group ( frg ) . </S>",
    "<S> the more general case of the mixed pion / kaon condensation will be reported elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> the frg method has been applied to a wide spectrum of the problems ranging from cold atoms to quantum gravity . in the context of pt </S>",
    "<S> the approach has been used to study the phase structure of neutron matter @xcite , the phenomena of bose - einstein condensation ( bec)@xcite and both balanced @xcite and imbalanced @xcite systems of cold fermionic atoms etc .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach makes use of the legendre transformed effective action : @xmath0=w[j]-j\\cdot \\phi_c$ ] , where @xmath1 is the usual partition function in the presence of an external source @xmath2 . the action functional @xmath3 generates the 1pi green s functions and it reduces to the effective potential for homogeneous systems . in the frg </S>",
    "<S> one introduces an artificial renormalisation group flow , generated by a momentum scale @xmath4 and we define the effective action by integrating over components of the fields with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the rg trajectory then interpolates between the classical action of the underlying field theory ( at large @xmath4 ) when the quantum fluctuation effects are excluded , and the full effective action ( at @xmath6 ) with all quantum fluctuations taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution equation for @xmath3 @xcite in the frg has a one - loop structure and can be written as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : gamevol}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the matrix containing second functional derivatives of the effective action with respect to the boson fields and @xmath9 is a matrix containing the corresponding cut - off functions which must vanish when the running scale approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> the flow equation as written above is just a differential form of a general functional intergal and has therefore a little practical sense . in order to actually solve the flow equations one needs to choose a certain ansatz for the effective action motivated by the form of the action at the starting scale and the undelying symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the ansatz assumed in this work is    @xmath10 = \\int d^4x\\ , \\left[z_\\phi\\,(\\partial_0 + i \\mu)\\phi^\\dagger\\,(\\partial_0 - i \\mu)\\phi -z_m\\,\\partial_i\\phi^\\dagger\\partial_i\\phi - u(\\phi,\\phi^\\dagger)\\right],\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the renormalisation factors depending on the running scale and @xmath13 is a complex doublet field defined as follows @xmath14 the first and second components of the doublet can be identified with the pair of ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) mesons correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> the effective potential depends only on the combination @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> we expand the effective potential @xmath18 near its minima and keep terms up to order @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 where first three terms correspond to the expansion near the minimum with respect to the first doublet and the rest is the expansion near the minimum with respect to the second doublet . </S>",
    "<S> note that the standard mass term is included in the definition of the @xmath21 coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential is provided by the external conditions ( we assume @xmath22 0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the action is invariant under the global @xmath23 group , where @xmath24 is the isospin group and @xmath25 is related to hypercharge . </S>",
    "<S> it essentually captures the mean features of the kaon condensation phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> substituting the ansatz for @xmath3 into the flow equation and performing the contour integration one can get the evolution equation for the effective potential which acts as a driving term generating the flow of the couplings . at large scale </S>",
    "<S> we expect symmetric state with the trivial minimum of the effective potential whereas at lower scale comparable with the value of chemical potential a formation of the condensate is expected .    @xmath26    where    @xmath27    and    @xmath28    here @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 and @xmath31 determine the pole positions of the corresponding propagator    @xmath32    another two poles are those with the overall minus sign in front . </S>",
    "<S> the positive and negative values of energy correspond to creation and annihilation of the exitations , respectively . for our purposes </S>",
    "<S> it is sufficient to pick up only positive eigenvalues .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the pole position defines the corresponding dispersion relations in the general case of nonzero regulator @xmath33 0 . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 0 one can recover the dispersion relations in the broken phase derived in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath37    another dispersion relations , also derived in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the limit of @xmath34 , @xmath35 take the form    @xmath38    as one can easily be seen from the above expressions two of the dispersion relations describe goldstone bosons , i.e gapless modes when @xmath39 0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the example of the nontrivial situation when the number of the broken generators is not equal to the number of the massless modes . indeed , since the initial global @xmath23 symmetry is broken to @xmath25 one could expect three massless modes . </S>",
    "<S> the problem was studied in details in @xcite where is was shown that in the system with a broken lorenz symmetry the number of gapless modes may be lesser then the number of broken generators . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason is the presence of the chemical potential which induces a mass splitting between the doublets ( @xmath15 ) and ( @xmath16 ) so that the first one acquire the effective mass @xmath40 whereas the effective mass for the second one becomes @xmath41 .    </S>",
    "<S> the couplings may in general depend not only on running scale but also on the magnitude of the condensate so that we define the total derivative as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> applying this to the effective potential and neglecting higher order terms gives the set of the flow equations @xmath44    the actual flow is determined by the choice of the cut - off function @xmath45 . in this exploratory study we have chosen the cut - off in the form suggested in @xcite @xmath46 the advantage of this form of cut - off is that it simplifies some algebra , allowing part of the calculations to be carried out analytically . </S>",
    "<S> one notes , however that this advantage may disappear for more complicated cases like , for example , in the mixed boson - fermion systems . to solve the system of the flow equations one needs to fix a set of initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> they were determined as follows . </S>",
    "<S> one starts from the effective action in vacuum where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is determined by the value of kaon - kaon scattering length in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the flow equations in vacuum can easily be obtained from the general expression for the @xmath51 by differentiating it with respect to @xmath52 and @xmath53 and putting @xmath54 , @xmath55 afterwards . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the flow equation for the couplings @xmath56 and @xmath57 take the form    @xmath58     = 510 mev , 550 mev and 595 mev correspondingly.,width=453 ]    and    @xmath59    the flow equations for the other couplings can be obtained in a similar way . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath60 is found to be very small at @xmath61 compared to the lower order couplings and the coupling @xmath62 does not really run in vacuum so that we put @xmath63 at starting scale .    </S>",
    "<S> these equations are solved using the values of couplings at @xmath6 as initial conditions . from the vacuum flow the values of the couplings at the starting scale for the general flow @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> are extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the scale @xmath65 is chosen to be much larger then any other mass scale involved in the problem . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken the value @xmath66 gev as the starting scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is large enough to provide practically independent results for the couplings at the physical scale @xmath67 . at the scale @xmath68 the mass term approaches zero thus signaling the onset of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath13 becomes nonzero and the system undergoes phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we show on fig.1 the behaviour of the mass term in the vicinity of the critical scale at several values of the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the critical value of the chemical potential for such a transition is found to be at @xmath69 as it should . at the scale @xmath70 3 gev the curves merge and follow this pattern up to starting point .    </S>",
    "<S> the change of the transition point as a function of the chemical potential is such that it grows with the increase of the chemical potential but , in any case the system undergoes the transition to the broken phase at the scale @xmath71 . at this scale the mass term vanishes and </S>",
    "<S> the condensate develops .    on the other hand the character of </S>",
    "<S> the change of the mass term for the other fields in @xmath72 is such that it stays positive for any scale so that ssb never happens . </S>",
    "<S> one may , therefore conclude that , whereas @xmath73 and @xmath74 mesons condense , the pair of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 mesons does not in agreement with the results from @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one notes that the mechanism of the condensation considered in this paper and in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is related to an instabilities in the colour - flavour locked phase of qcd @xcite is therefore quite different from the conventional condensation of @xmath76 mesons suggested in @xcite which is related to attractive interaction between @xmath76 mesons and nucleons .     </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to kaon - kaon scattering lengths from the lattice calculations @xcite(upper curve ) , lowest order chiral perturbation theory @xcite ( middle curve ) and phenomenological model @xcite ( lower curve),width=381 ]    .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.2 we show the behaviour of the condensate as the function of chemical potential at physical scale when @xmath77 and for three values of the @xmath78 coupling . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see from fig.2 the value of the condensate grows with the increase of the chemical potential in all three cases . </S>",
    "<S> this growth is relatively fast at the threshold @xmath79 and then slows down for the larger values of the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> we note however that the results become less reliable with an increase of the chemical potential as the energy / momentum dependence of the couplings neglected in this study may become progressively more important at larger @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> the important ingredient of the approach is the running coupling @xmath78 , which is related to the kaon - kaon scattering length . to get the results shown by the upper curve on fig.2 we used the value for the scattering length obtained in the lattice calculations @xmath80= </S>",
    "<S> -0.310 @xmath81 , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the middle curve corresponds to the use of the lowest order chiral perturbation theory result @xmath82 @xcite and the lower one is obtained using the phenomenological model from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from fig.2 that the difference between the results is quite noticeable , especially at the threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> it becomes less sensitive to the kaon - kaon interaction at the chemical potentials significantly larger then kaon mass but then using energy / momentum independent interaction vertices may not be sufficient . taking into account the next to leading order in chiral perturbation theory does not make this difference any smaller . on the contrary , the next - to - leading order chiral perturbation theory leads to even larger deviation from the lattice results . </S>",
    "<S> in any case the chiral perturbation theory based estimates are not very reliable as @xmath83 chiral perturbation theory does not converge well and some sort of resummation techniques are probably required like those developed for the kaon - nucleon scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> overall one can conclude that the @xmath78 coupling generates a significant source of the theoretical uncertainty related to a poor knowledge of the kaon - kaon scattering amplitude at threshold . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is important for establishing the correct equation of state ( e0s ) for neutron stars .    in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we have used the frg approach to analyse the phenomena of kaon condensation . </S>",
    "<S> we found that at @xmath84 the system undergoes the transition to the broken phase with a nontrivial vacuum resulting in formation of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> however the exact value of the condensate ca nt in present be determined accurately because of lack of knowledge about the magnitude of the kaon - kaon scattering length .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several ways of how the approach can be extended and improved . </S>",
    "<S> first , the energy / momentum dependence of the interaction vertices should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> it may be important for estimation the effect of depletion of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> second , instead of rather toy model for effective action , used in this paper one can utilize a more realistic action based on effective lagrangian like that derived in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the induced or effective chemical potential considered there will emerge as the result of the rg flow . </S>",
    "<S> third , physically interesting case of competing chiral and kaon condensates can be considered . </S>",
    "<S> apart from that it would be interesting to consider a mixed system with both kaon and pion condensates . </S>",
    "<S> these condensates may influence each other via @xmath85 scattering which may have important consequences for the neutron stars eos . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the mixed pion - kaon system will be reported in future publications . </S>"
