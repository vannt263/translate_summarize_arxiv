    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will collide 7 tev proton beams with luminosities ranging from 10@xmath1 to 10@xmath2@xmath3s@xmath4 .",
    "the very high energy and luminosity foreseen will allow to investigate the tev scale in search for new phenomena beyond the standard model .",
    "reaching such performance is an outstanding challenge for both the collider and the detectors .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter of the atlas detector , one of the two multi purpose experiments at lhc , is a lead and liquid argon sampling calorimeter with accordion shaped absorbers . in its dynamic range covering the few gev up to the few tev domain an excellent measurement of the energy of electrons and photons",
    "is required in order to resolve potential new particle resonances , and to measure precisely particle masses and couplings .",
    "one of the salient benchmark processes that has guided the design of the electromagnetic atlas calorimeter is the higgs boson production with subsequent decay into a pair of photons .",
    "this event topology will be observable only if the higgs boson mass is smaller than @xmath5150  gev / c@xmath6 . in this channel",
    "the capabilities of the calorimeter in terms of photon pointing resolution and @xmath7/@xmath8 discrimination are of chief concern .",
    "an excellent and uniform measurement of the photon energy is essential .",
    "another process involving the higgs boson where it decays to a pair of z bosons and subsequently into four electrons also requires a uniform measurement of the electron energy over a large dynamic range . finally , among the processes which will require the most accurate knowledge of the electron energy is the w mass measurement whose goal precision is @xmath50.2 @xmath0 .",
    "for all these processes the constant term @xmath9 of the three main resolution elements : @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the noise and stochastic terms respectively ) plays an important role .",
    "it arises from various sources encompassing the calibration and readout electronics , the amount of material before and in the calorimeter , the energy reconstruction scheme and its stability in time .",
    "the @xmath11 term comprises the electronic noise and the pile - up .",
    "many years of r&d work  @xcite have led to the atlas calorimeter design whose first performance assessments on pre - production modules were reported in  @xcite . since then , modifications were made in order to improve the production , the quality control and the performance of the calorimeter modules . during the three years of module construction , four barrel and three endcap modules have been exposed to electron beams in the north area at cern s sps .",
    "the primary aim was to assess the quality of the production by measuring the response uniformity over the complete acceptance .",
    "however , these measurements have led to numerous further improvements of the calibration , signal reconstruction and the simulation of the calorimeter .",
    "this paper reports on measurements of the uniformity and a study of the different contributions to the constant term of the electron energy resolution for barrel and endcap modules exposed to high energy electron beams .",
    "the actions taken to optimize the electron energy resolution and in particular the uniformity of the response are also described .",
    "finally a review of all sources of non - uniformities is presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calomod ] the main features of the calorimeter modules are described and the differences with respect to the pre - production modules are briefly presented . a description of the readout and calibration electronics is then given in sec .",

    "the atlas electromagnetic calorimeter is a lead and liquid argon sampling calorimeter using an accordion geometry for gaps and absorbers .",
    "it is composed of a cylindrical barrel centered on the beam and two endcaps .",
    "the usual slightly modified polar coordinate system is used , where the @xmath13-axis coincides with the beam axis , @xmath14 is the azimuthal angle and the polar angle @xmath15 is replaced by the pseudo rapidity @xmath16 .",
    "a detailed description of the detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the main characteristics are , however , described hereafter .",
    "the atlas barrel calorimeter is divided in two half barrels covering the positive and the negative pseudo rapidities , from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the inner and outer diameters are about 2.8 m and 4 m. each half barrel consists of sixteen 3.2 meter long modules made of 64 accordion shaped absorbers interleaved with readout electrodes .",
    "modules are made of two types of electrodes denoted a and b covering the pseudo rapidity ranges @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] separated by 2.5 mm at the transition point .",
    "the construction and testing of these modules is reported in  @xcite . in each of these regions",
    "the lead thickness is different in order to maintain an approximately constant stochastic term of the energy resolution ( 1.53 mm for @xmath21 and 1.13 mm for @xmath22 ) .",
    "the drift gap on each side of the electrode is 2.1 mm which corresponds to a total drift time of about 450 ns at 2  kv .",
    "the electrodes are segmented in three compartments in depth ( front , middle , back ) .",
    "the first section with narrow strips along @xmath23 , ends after 4 radiations lengths ( @xmath24 ) , while the second stops after 22 @xmath24 .",
    "the total thickness of the module varies as a function of @xmath23 between 22 and 33 @xmath24 . summing boards , plugged on the electrodes ,",

    "a presampler is placed in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter inside the cryostat .",
    "each unit provides coverage in @xmath26 from 0 to 1.52 and covers a region of @xmath27 .",
    "the signal is sampled in a thin active layer of 11  mm of liquid argon with a readout cell granularity of @xmath28  @xcite . in total",
    ", there are 3424 readout cells per module .",
    "the high voltage is supplied independently on each side of the electrode by sectors of @xmath29=0.2@xmath30 0.2 corresponding to 32 electrodes .",
    "four barrel modules ( two of each half barrel ) where exposed in the h8 beam test line , namely m13 , m10 , p15 and p13 .",
    "they are now part of the final atlas calorimeter . however , because of the incorrect mounting of the support of a cerenkov counter , non homogeneous material was added in the beamline while the module m13 was being tested . as a consequence",
    "its performance could not be thoroughly measured .",
    "therefore , only results for m10 , p13 and p15 are presented .",
    "the atlas electromagnetic endcap calorimeter ( emec ) covers the rapidity region from 1.375 up to 3.2 and consists of 2 wheels , one on each side of the electromagnetic barrel .",
    "each wheel , divided into eight wedge - shaped modules , is 63 cm thick with internal and external radii of about 30  cm and 2  m. for technical reasons , it is divided in one outer ( @xmath31 ) and one inner ( @xmath32 ) wheel , both projective in @xmath23 .",
    "the crack between the wheels is about 3  mm wide and is mainly filled with low density material . in @xmath14 , one outer ( inner ) wheel module is made of 96 ( 32 )  accordion shaped absorbers interleaved with readout electrodes , covering a range of @xmath33 . accommodating the accordion shape in the endcap region induces a quite complicated geometry .",
    "most of the design parameters vary along the radius direction ( corresponding to @xmath23 )  : liquid argon gap , sampling fraction , accordion wave amplitudes or folding angles . a continuously varying high voltage setting along @xmath23 ,",
    "would partially compensate for this and imply an almost @xmath23-independent detector response .",
    "however , the high voltage is set by steps .",
    "the outer ( inner ) wheel is divided into seven ( two ) high voltage sectors . in each of them",
    "a residual @xmath23-dependence of the response will need to be corrected .    in the region devoted to precision physics ,",
    "where the tracking information is available ( @xmath34 ) , the depth segmentation is similar to the barrel one . at large rapidity",
    ", there are only two compartments in depth .",
    "twelve adjacent electrodes are summed for one strip cell and 3 ( 4 ) for middle and back cells in the outer ( inner ) wheel .",
    "the segmentation of the emec is summarized in table  [ tab : granularity ] .",
    "there are 3888 readout cells per module .",

    "the response uniformity of the atlas liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter to high energy electrons has been studied in the pseudo rapidity range from 0 to 3.2 .",
    "these results encompass both the barrel and endcap calorimeters which were independently tested in different beam lines using 245 and 119  gev electrons respectively .",

    "[ fig : summary]_,width=529 ]    for the barrel modules a modified version of the energy reconstruction scheme developped in  @xcite mostly based on a full monte carlo simulation is used .",
    "most potential sources of non - uniformity were reviewed and their impact was independently estimated . when comparing the estimated non - uniformity to the measured one a very good agreement is observed thus indicating that the sources of non - uniformity are well understood . for the endcap modules the material upstream of the calorimeter is approximately constant , a simpler energy reconstruction scheme is thus applied . a full monte carlo simulation accounting for the complex geometry of emec modules",
    "is performed and is in good agreement with the data .",
