    "for nearly a decade it has been assumed that the universe is presently undergoing a period of acceleration driven by an exotic form of dark energy . in a new model proposed by one of us",
    ", it has been claimed that it is possible to fit type ia supernovae ( sneia ) luminosity distances without exotic forms of dark energy , and without cosmic acceleration .",
    "the new model was developed on the basis of a suggestion of kolb , matarrese , notari and riotto ( 2005 ) , that cosmological evolution must take into account super  horizon sized remnant perturbations from an epoch of primordial inflation .",
    "the new model cosmology of wiltshire ( 2005a,2005b )  henceforth the fractal bubble ( fb ) model  shares the basic assumption of  that the observed universe resides within an underdense bubble , , in a bulk universe which has the geometry of a spatially flat friedmann  robertson  walker ( frw ) geometry on the largest of scales .",
    "in other respects , however , the differs substantially from that of . in particular , the  is based on exact solutions of einstein s equations , whereas  based their analysis on linearized perturbations , with a number of approximations . furthermore , while kolb  suggested that the deceleration parameter would behave as @xmath6 at late times , in the @xmath7 . the  has the added advantage that it can make quantitative predictions for many cosmological quantities in the epoch of matter domination based on two parameters , the hubble constant , @xmath8 , and the density parameter , @xmath2 .",
    "the  makes two crucial physical assumptions .",
    "the first , as just mentioned , is that our observed universe resides in an underdense bubble , which is a natural outcome of primordial inflation .",
    "the second assumption is that on account of the bottom  up manner in which structure forms and spatial geometry evolves in an inhomogeneous universe with the particular density perturbations that arise from primordial inflation , the local clocks of isotropic observers in average galaxies in bubble walls at the present epoch , are defined in a particular way .",
    "the small scale bound systems which correspond to typical stars in typical galaxies retain local geometries with an asymptotic time parameter frozen in to match the cosmic time of the average surfaces of homogeneity in their past light cones at the epoch they broke away from the hubble flow .",
    "that local average geometry was a spatially flat einstein  de sitter universe , even though the presently observable universe , , is underdense when averaged on the larger spatial scales where structure forms later .",
    "these arguments are clarified at length by wiltshire ( 2005b ) .",
    "the physical implication of this is that we must consider an alternative solution to the fitting problem in cosmology ( ellis and stoeger 1987 ) .",
    "the open frw geometry [ frwopen1 ] s^2 = - ^2 + ^2 ( ) , retains meaning as an average geometry for the whole universe at late epochs , but most closely approximates the local geometry only in voids , these being the average spatial positions on spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "however , in the matching of asymptotic geometries between those scales and the non  expanding scales of bounds stars and star clusters in average galaxies in bubble walls , it is assumed that a non - trivial lapse function @xmath9 enters , so that observers in such galaxies describe the same average geometry ( [ frwopen1 ] ) in terms of a different conformal frame [ frwopen3 ] s^2 = ^2()^2 , where [ frwopen4 ] ^2= -^2 + ^2 ( ) , and @xmath10 .",
    "the lapse function is uniquely determined , and with a careful re  calibration of cosmic clocks , a model cosmology can be constructed , which has the potential to fit luminosity distances without cosmic acceleration .",
    "it is the aim of this _ letter _ to test this claim against the available sneia data .",
    "we adopt the notation and conventions of wiltshire ( 2005a,2005b ) .",
    "starting from the standard definition of the redshift @xmath11 , 1+z , the luminosity distance for the cosmological model given in ( wiltshire 2005a )  is d = , [ dl ] where @xmath8 is the currently measured value of the hubble constant , @xmath12 is a conveniently defined parameter , related to the current matter density parameter , @xmath2 , according to = 6 - 2 , and @xmath13 is given by = - + .",
    "to make contact with observation the luminosity distance ( [ dl ] ) is related to the distance modulus @xmath14 by the standard formula m - m = 5_10(d ) + 25.let us define @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the apparent magnitude for the @xmath17 universe . a plot of @xmath18 versus @xmath11 for the  as compared to the  and open frw models is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltamu ] . for @xmath19",
    "the distance modulus of the fb model is indistinguishable from that of a milne universe over the range @xmath20 ; while even the @xmath21 fb model is closer to a milne universe than the @xmath19 open frw model .",
    "we have compared the new  to the supernova data using the `` gold data set '' recently published by riess  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 and bayes factor method employed followed the one outlined in ng and wiltshire ( 2001 ) .",
    "use of the luminosity distance ( [ dl ] ) requires a series expansion near @xmath23 to avoid numerical problems : for @xmath24 we used a laurent series to order @xmath25 .",
    "the results are presented here in figs .",
    "[ fig : lcdm ] and [ fig : fb ] , where the 1@xmath26 , 2@xmath26 and 3@xmath26 confidence contours are plotted in the @xmath27 parameter space .",
    "a good fit for the @xmath28cdm model was at @xmath29 and @xmath30 with ( @xmath31 ) ( riess  2004 ) .",
    "for the  the best fit values are at @xmath32 and include the @xmath33 range @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath36 is affected so little by the value of @xmath2 in this range that we do not quote a single best  fit value .",
    "the @xmath37 confidence limit is @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath2 can be made arbitrarily small within the @xmath33 bounds .",
    "since recalibrated primordial nucleosynthesis bounds for baryonic matter are typically in the range @xmath39@xmath40 , we see that the supernova data fit well for the  regardless of whether or not there is cold dark matter in addition to baryonic matter .",
    "a bayes factor for the two models can be calculated from the data by b_12 = .",
    "[ bayes]this result can be interpreted using table [ tab : bayesfac ] .",
    "for very wide priors , namely @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the bayes factor is 396 in favour of .",
    "however , we note that the bayes factor is very sensitive to the range chosen for the priors , since the best  fit values for the two models are include quite distinct values of @xmath2 .",
    "this is seen in table [ tab : bayescomp ] , where narrower priors are used for @xmath8 , and a variety of priors for @xmath2 .",
    "the examples with baryonic matter only use values of the baryon matter density from primordial nucleosynthesis bounds , as specifically recalibrated for the fb model by wiltshire ( 2005b ) : it is found that the density fraction of ordinary baryonic matter is 23 times that which is conventionally obtained , and typically @xmath43 is expected .",
    ".interpretation of bayes factors [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to characterise the parameter space better , we also give a plot of the @xmath36 value as a function of @xmath2 for the best ",
    "fit value of @xmath8 in each model in fig .",
    "[ fig : slice ] , and similarly plot @xmath44 for the two models for the whole parameter space spanned by @xmath2 and @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bayesplot ] .",
    "the  is favoured for lower values of @xmath2 and @xmath8 , and  for higher values of both parameters . also observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : slice ] how insensitive the  is to the value of @xmath2 in the range @xmath45 .",
    "while sneia serve as excellent standard candles there is some dispersion observed in their absolute magnitudes .",
    "however , a relation first proposed by phillips ( 1993 ) , relates the absolute magnitude , @xmath46 , to the change in apparent magnitude from peak to 15 days after peak , @xmath47 , as measured by clocks _ in the rest frame of the supernova_. various methods have been used to fit light curves to obtain absolute magnitudes ( drell , loredo & wasserman 2000 , tonry 2003 ) .",
    "it is also well demonstrated that redshift causes a broadening of light curves ( leibundgut 1996 ) corresponding to the phenomenon of cosmic time dilation . in standard cosmology",
    "the redshift is entirely attributable to cosmic expansion .",
    "it is then a simple matter to transform the observed light curve to the rest frame . in the 1+z",
    "= , so that the measured redshift differs from that inferred from ( [ frwopen1 ] ) .",
    "however , for null geodesics the transformation to the rest frame only involves only the overall @xmath48 factor of the measured redshift , so that the light curve broadening determination will be unaffected .",
    "only measurements which involved some independent determination of @xmath49 , would lead to measurable differences between this model and models based on the conventional identification of clock rates .",
    "it is impossible to comment on the phillips relations , and other related aspects of data  fitting , without access to the raw data .",
    "however , since these are relations are empirical , it is not likely that there would be significant differences in the .",
    "the only likely systematic errors that are as yet unaccounted for in reducing the data for comparison with the  are those effects directly related to the inhomogeneous geometry .",
    "the metric ( [ frwopen1 ] ) represents an average geometry only , and for the redshifts which presently constitute the bulk of the sample , a better understanding of intermediate scales in the fitting problem may be required .",
    "studies of local voids  at scales well within the bubble  do reveal that measurable effects on cosmological parameters are possible ( tomita 2001 ) . in the present model ,",
    "the average rate of expansion of typical @xmath50 mpc voids would differ from that of much larger voids . while the dominant effect on luminosity distances suggested here is a new effect due to the identification of an alternative homogeneous time parameter in solving the `` fitting problem '' , further scale dependent corrections in the fractal geometry are certainly to be expected .",
    "from the standard bayesian analysis with wide priors we would conclude that on the basis of the `` gold data set '' of ( riess  2004 ) , the standard  model is very strongly favoured over the .",
    "nonetheless , this conclusion depends strongly on the priors assumed , as illustrated by table [ tab : bayescomp ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : slice ] and [ fig : bayesplot ] .",
    "we must also bear in mind that the average geometry ( [ frwopen1])([frwopen4 ] ) is just a first approximation to the fitting problem . a better understanding of the differential expansion rates of different characteristic sizes of voids in the inhomogeneous geometry may improve the fit of the  at those redshifts which are most significant for the claims of cosmic acceleration , rather than a nearly empty universe deceleration .",
    "the has other significant advantages in terms of it greatly increased expansion age ( wiltshire 2005a ) , which has the potential to explain the formation of structure at large redshifts .",
    "thus it should be considered as a serious alternative to models with dark energy , quite apart from its intrinsic appeal of being a model based simply on general relativity and primordial inflation without needing exotic dark energy , the presence of which at the present epoch would be a mystery to physics .    in the end",
    ", nature is the final arbiter , and future supernova observations at higher redshifts , such as those of the snap mission , will certainly be able to much more decisively distinguish between the  and , given the significantly more rapid deceleration of  at redshifts @xmath51 .",
    "* note added * : after this work appeared an independent sneia data analysis of the milne universe  considered as an approximation to a variety of alternative theories  has been performed ( sethi , dev & jain 2005 ) .",
    "they obtain a comfortable fit just as we would expect from our results given that the fb model mimics a milne universe for @xmath52 .",
