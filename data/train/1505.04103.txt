    "let us consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath51 we have @xmath52 where eigenfunctions @xmath53 form a basis in @xmath47 .",
    "therefore @xmath54 for the fractional power of the operator @xmath37 , we have @xmath55    using the above approximations , we arrive from ( [ 2.4 ] ) at the discrete problem @xmath56    an approximate solution is sought as a solution of an auxiliary pseudo - time evolutionary problem @xcite .",

    "for the solution of the problem ( [ 3.3 ] ) , ( [ 3.5 ] ) , it is possible to obtain various a priori estimates .",

    "the numerical implementation of the difference scheme ( [ 3.7 ] ) , ( [ 3.8 ] ) involves the solution of standard elliptic boundary value problems @xmath92 with the given @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "the inversion of the operator @xmath95 may be enough difficult .",
    "thus , it seems natural to construct difference schemes for unsteady problems such that they will be unconditionally stable , but at the same time , their implementation would be considerably simpler .",
    "the most interesting results have been obtained taking into account a special structure of the problem operator @xmath37 .",
    "we define a class of the problems ( [ 3.1 ] ) , ( [ 3.2 ] ) , where the operator @xmath37 has the following @xmath96-component additive representation : @xmath97 assume that the operators @xmath98 are simpler than @xmath37 .",
    "we organize computations in such a way that the transition to a new time level in solving the problem ( [ 3.3 ] ) , ( [ 3.5 ] ) is not more complicated than the solution of the @xmath96 problems for the individual operator terms : @xmath98 .",
    "such difference schemes are called additive difference schemes @xcite .    a decomposition into operator terms in the additive representation ( [ 4.1 ] )",
    "may have a different nature .",
    "in particular , additive difference schemes are used to solve numerically multidimensional transient problems of mathematical physics , where one - dimensional problems are the most simple ones .",
    "on the basis of splitting with respect to the spatial variables , we construct locally one - dimensional schemes . in using computational algorithms of domain decomposition , which focus on modern parallel computers , the original problem is divided into several subproblems , and each of them is solved in its own subdomain on its individual processor .    to solve numerically the evolutionary problem ( [ 3.3])([3.5 ] )",
    ", it seems reasonable to apply the following additive representation of @xmath99 : @xmath100 with pairwise non - permutable operators @xmath101 : @xmath102 for the splitting ( [ 4.1 ] ) , we put @xmath103 with an appropriate choice of the constants @xmath104 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath105 then we may take @xmath106    the problem ( [ 3.3 ] ) , ( [ 3.5 ] ) , ( [ 4.2 ] ) does not allow the use of the standard splitting schemes because here we have a splitting of the operator at the time derivative .",
    "in the work @xcite , we proposed and investigated vector additive - operator schemes with a splitting of the operator at the time derivative into the sum of positive definite self - adjoint operators . here",
    "we consider a class of problems with a splitting of both the leading operator of the problem and the operator at the time derivative .",
    "such problems are typical in studying boundary value problems for pseudo - parabolic equations .",
    "some vector splitting schemes for pseudo - parabolic equations with constant operators are considered in @xcite .    for the cauchy problem ( [ 3.3 ] ) , ( [ 3.5 ] ) , ( [ 4.2 ] ) , we specify the vector @xmath107 . each individual component is determined as the solution of the similar problems @xmath108 @xmath109    here is an elementary coordinate - wise estimate for the solution stability .",
    "subtracting one equation from another , we get @xmath110 in view of the initial conditions ( [ 4.4 ] ) , we have @xmath111 for the individual component @xmath112 , we obtain the same equation as for @xmath113 : @xmath114 thus ( see ( [ 3.6 ] ) ) , a priori estimates @xmath115 are satisfied .",
    "because of this , we have @xmath116 and so , we can treat any component of the vector @xmath117 as the solution of the original problem ( [ 3.3 ] ) , ( [ 3.5 ] ) .    for the vector evolutionary problem ( [ 4.3 ] ) , ( [ 4.4 ] )",
    ", it is easy to obtain ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) a priori estimates for the vector @xmath118 .",
    "let us introduce the hilbert space @xmath119 with the scalar product @xmath120    rewrite equation ( [ 4.3 ] ) as @xmath121 this allows us to write the system of equations in the vector form @xmath122 operator matrices @xmath123 and @xmath124 seem like this @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the equation ( [ 4.6 ] ) is supplemented with the initial condition @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "the principal advantage of using the formulation ( [ 4.6 ] ) results from the fact that in @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 let us consider an a priori estimate for the solution of the vector problem ( [ 4.6])([4.8 ] ) , which , on the one hand , is more complicated than ( [ 4.5 ] ) , and on the other hand , it will serve us as a guide for constructing operator - difference schemes .",
    "for @xmath123 , we introduce the representation @xmath131 where @xmath132 rewrite equation ( [ 4.6 ] ) in the form @xmath133 by ( [ 4.7 ] ) , we get @xmath134 and so we have @xmath135 . multiply ( [ 4.9 ] ) scalarly in @xmath129 by @xmath136 this gives @xmath137 in view of @xmath138 , from ( [ 4.10 ] ) , we get that the estimate @xmath139 holds .",
    "taking into account the representation for @xmath140 , we have @xmath141 thus , the estimate ( [ 4.11 ] ) along with ( [ 4.5 ] ) may be treated as a vector analogue of the estimate ( [ 3.6 ] ) . in view of (",

    "in fact , we construct splitting schemes for the system of unsteady equations ( [ 4.3 ] ) , ( [ 4.4 ] ) , which are coupled via time derivatives . for such problems ,",
    "the construction of unconditionally stable splitting schemes can be carried out on the basis of the triangular splitting of the operator matrices @xmath123 and @xmath124 or the separation of the diagonal part of these operator matrices @xcite . in some cases , it is reasonable to combine these approaches , namely , to conduct the triangular splitting of the operator matrix @xmath123 and to separate the diagonal of the operator matrix @xmath124 , or vice versa .",
