    "the massless wave equation ( [ wave_equation ] ) is used to describe massless scalar particles in flat spacetime , which , as a remarkable matter of fact , have never been observed experimentally in the physical particle spectrum .",
    "the massless case has to be clearly distinguished from the massive case due to group theoretical reasons related to the representation theory of the proper orthochronous poincar group ; there is no classical counterpart to a massless quantum particle .",
    "+ massless scalar fields play some theoretical rle in cosmological inflation models on curved spacetime @xcite , however , contrary to the massive case which differs strongly from the massless case due to the existence of a length scale and the corresponding exponential decay of correlation functions , the scalar massless case with its special properties has not been discussed in the literature in great detail so far .",
    "one reason might be the fact that massless interacting theories like , e.g. , massless scalar electrodynamics , the theory of the electromagnetic interactions of a mass - zero charged scalar field , has led to endless paradoxes like infinite cross sections when one tried to interpret it in a consistent manner , i.e. there is strong evidence against the existence of an s - matrix in such a theory .",
    "however , the coleman - weinberg mechanism shows a way out in the sense that radiative corrections may produce spontaneous symmetry breakdown in theories for which the semiclassical ( tree ) approximation does not indicate such breakdown such that the theory of a massless charged scalar finally becomes the theory of a massive vector meson and a massive scalar meson @xcite .",

    "@xmath5 is equal to one such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",

    "for the sake of completeness , we start with some basic considerations concerning massless scalar fields . in many cases ,",
    "the generalization of the discussion below to the massive case is straightforward .",
    "+ the general solution of the wave equation @xmath12 has its support on the light cone in momentum space , since @xmath13 must hold for @xmath14 , and can be written in the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 , the distributional identity @xmath17 holds , hence the frequency decomposition with @xmath18 @xmath19 \\ , , \\ ] ] follows , with @xmath20 the objects considered above may have a smooth analytic or a singular distributional ( operator valued ) character , depending on the theoretical setting under study . for the moment , @xmath21 shall be considered as a complex klein - gordon wave function .",

    "( [ cc ] ) is that @xmath21 describes two particles with opposite charge : a particle with negative - frequency wave function @xmath38 and an anti - particle with positive - frequency wave function @xmath39 of course , it is a matter of pure convention to label the frequency of the wave function of a particle as negative . both in the negative- and the positive - frequency case , the energy of the ( anti-)particle is positive . + it is common usage to call the current eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) a local quantity , since it depends _ locally _ on quantities of the scalar field like the field strength or its derivatives . still , the situation is a bit more involved .",
    "in order to understand the locality properties of the charge current eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) properly , the structure of the charge density @xmath40 has to be understood from both the single particle wave function aspect as well as from the quantum field theoretical point of view .",
    "a complex klein - gordon wave function @xmath41 can be specified , e.g. , by cauchy data at @xmath42 @xmath43 for the future @xmath44 . however ,",
    "if one considers a wave function describing only one particle alone in the universe , the situation is completely different , since the time derivative @xmath45 depends in this case on the wave function @xmath21 .",

    "( [ kernel ] ) can also be evaluated directly ( with @xmath71 and @xmath72 for notational convenience here ) @xmath73 @xmath74 this divergent integral becomes meaningful as the weak ( i.e. distributional ) limit of the convergent integrals @xmath75 again reproducing eq .",
    "( [ massless_kernel ] ) .",
    "+ we conclude that the klein - gordon density @xmath76 in the setting of single particle wave mechanics is only formally a local quantity , since its definition contains a time derivative depending in a non - local manner on the single particle wave function .",

    "+ in the case of massive particles , the corresponding integral kernel @xmath77 of a particle with mass @xmath78 involves the compton wavelength @xmath79 of course , and decays exponentially on this length scale . the uncertainty in eq .",
    "( [ convo ] ) discussed above has nothing to do with the usual quantum mechanical position uncertainty of a particle due to the spatial extension of the wave function in the non - relativistic case . in a way , it is a generic uncertainty of the single - particle wave function itself .",
    "+ some expressions given above can be obtained as special cases from the general distributional weak limit given for @xmath80 by @xmath81",
    "interpreting @xmath82 generated by a single particle wave @xmath83 function containing one frequency type only @xmath84 has strange consequences , since even in the presence of negative or positive frequencies only @xmath82 can be positive and negative at different spacetime regions .",
    "this can easily be illustrated by superposing two negative frequency plane waves according to @xmath85 concentrating on the spatial origin of the coordinate system for the sake of simplicity , one has ( @xmath86 ) @xmath87 @xmath88 \\ , .\\ ] ] e.g. , for the numerical values @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 one has @xmath92 , and therefore the amplitude of the oscillatory cosine - term , which is greater than the temporal mean of @xmath93 , will cause local oscillations between negative and positive values of @xmath82 . even if the klein - gordon wave function is restricted to a single particle type , the charge density can be indefinite .",
    "this is quite a remarkable result , since the indefiniteness of the klein - gordon density is often attributed in the literature to the presence of both positive and negative frequency solutions of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "if fact , even when one of the frequency types is projected away , the klein - gordon density remains indefinite .",
    "+ the incorrect claim that for negative - frequency wave functions , the timelike component @xmath94 of the klein - gordon current is positive - definite in minkowski space , and that therefore `` a consistent theory [ of localization in minkowski space ] can be developed for a free [ relativistic spin - zero ] particle '' @xcite turns out to be totally false since , as eventually rigorously proved by gerlach et al .",
    "@xcite , the opposite is actually true : for any single - frequency solution of the klein - gordon equation there are points in minkowski space where @xmath95 and points where @xmath96 at the same time .",
    "hence , the klein - gordon current is never a probability current . as a matter of fact",
    ", the problem of sharp localization of spin - zero quantum particles in relation to classical lorentz frames turns out to be unsolvable , as will be discussed in detail at the end of this paper .",
    "this observation remains true for arbitrary spin values , for massive as well as for quantum particles of zero mass .",
    "claims that no problems with the conventional notion of particle localizability occur in the case of relativistic quantum particles of spin-1/2 also turn out to be wrong @xcite .",
