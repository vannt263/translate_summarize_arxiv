    "in the phenomenological study of quark gluon plasma(qgp ) , when its bulk properties are concerned , the system of quarks and gluons is usually treated as gas or liquid",
    ". then the fundamental parameters of qgp such as transport coefficients , are very important information . in the high temperature limit",
    ", they are calculated based on the perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "however , as temperature @xmath2 decreases the perturbative calculation breaks down .",
    "the purpose of this work is to calculate the transport coefficient from the fundamental theory of qcd by lattice simulations in the vicinity of @xmath3 .",
    "+ the calculation of transport coefficients on the lattice is formulated in the framework of linear response theory of kubo@xcite .",
    "they are expressed by the space time integral of retarded green s function of energy momentum tensors at finite temperature .",
    "the shear viscosity @xmath4 is expressed as , @xmath5 similarly the bulk viscosity and heat conductivity are expressed in terms of the retarded green s function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 components of energy momentum tensor .",
    "the direct calculation of the retarded green s function at finite temperature is very difficult .",
    "then the shortcut is to calculate matsubara green s function(@xmath8 ) and then by the analytic continuation , we obtain the retarded green s function at finite temperature .",
    "the analytic continuation is carried out by the use of the fact that the spectral function of fourier transform of the both green s functions is the same .",
    "for the spectral function we use the following simplest ansatz@xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is related to the imaginary part of self energy and partially represents the effects of the interactions . under this ansatz ,",
    "the transport coefficients are calculated as , @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents @xmath4 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is lattice spacing .",
    "notice that if @xmath16 or @xmath17 , transport coefficient becomes zero . in order to determine these three parameters , at least three independent data points in @xmath8 are required in the temperature direction , which means @xmath18 .",
    "it is found that the the fluctuation of @xmath8 is large , and it is a very important problem to reduce the fluctuation of @xmath8 .",
    "we find that by using the iwasaki s improved action , the fluctuation is much reduced@xcite . then we apply iwasaki s improved action for the simulation of su(3 ) gauge theory .",
    "+ the finite temperature transition point at @xmath19 with iwasaki s improved action is @xmath20 on @xmath0 lattice .",
    "we choose our simulation point at @xmath21 and @xmath22 . from @xmath23 monte carlo data ,",
    "we obtain @xmath24 for @xmath6 and @xmath25 .",
    "but they have still rather large errors .",
    "the fit of @xmath8 with parameters by eq.(2 ) is done with sals .",
    "the shear and bulk viscosities are obtained by these parameters by eq.(3 ) , and the errors are estimated by the jackknife method . + the results for shear and bulk viscosities are shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is found that the bulk viscosity is smaller than shear viscosity and is consistent with zero within errors .",
    "this is consistent with the result of perturbative calculation at high temperature limit , which has been @xmath26@xcite .",
    "+    we compare our results for shear viscosity with those perturbative formula at high temperature limit@xcite , @xmath27 . where @xmath28 is a running coupling constants given by , @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 is a scale parameter of qcd .",
    "@xmath31 is a constant depending on the method of calculation ( @xmath32 ) . by using the relation @xmath33 , perturbative formula",
    "is expressed by the lattice spacing @xmath15 as follows , @xmath34    the scale parameter @xmath30 on the lattice is determined by assuming asymptotic scaling relation and @xmath35 at @xmath19 . from the finite size scaling relation reported by the tsukuba group@xcite , @xmath36 at @xmath37 for @xmath19 . and using @xmath38 @xcite for improved action , @xmath30 is determined by , @xmath39 . with these quantities the perturbative formula eq.(4 )",
    "is compared with our calculation as shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is found that our result are located not so different from the simple extrapolation of perturbative calculation on the figure .",
    "but notice that the eq.(4 ) breaks down around @xmath40 .",
    "+ the shear viscosity in the physical unit are obtained if we assume asymptotic scaling relation for @xmath41 region .",
    "the results are shown in fig.3 .",
    "they are slightly smaller than the ordinally hadron masses .",
    "what is the physical effects on the phenomenology of quark gluon plasma , when it has shear viscosity with this magnitudes , is a very interesting problem .",
    "+ in our calculation , @xmath8 of @xmath42 from which the heat conductivity is calculated , has large background and we could not get signal from it . +",
    "at first stage of our calculation we planed to calculate transport coefficients both on confined and deconfined phase . from the simulation of u(1 ) gauge theory ,",
    "it is found that the fluctuation of @xmath8 in the confined phase is much larger than those of deconfined phase , and we could not determine the green s functions even with about @xmath43 data@xcite in confined phase .",
    "similar results are obtained in the case of su(2 ) gauge theory .    to find the the difference of @xmath8 between confined and deconfined phase , we study the gluon propagators at finite temperature on @xmath44 lattice , because @xmath8 are expressed by the gauge invariant combination of gluon propagators .",
    "however the gluon propagator itself is gauge dependent , and we should fix the gauge .",
    "it is done by maximize @xmath45 by successive gauge transformation@xcite , which is a lattice version of lorentz gauge .",
    "+ the stopping condition for maximizing @xmath46 is @xmath47 .",
    "it is found that the gluon propagators are very sensitive to @xmath48 when @xmath49 . with this stopping condition",
    ", we could not find the gauge copies in the deconfined phase . while in the confined phase , gauge copies are found .",
    "then in the confined phase , we repeat random gauge transformation and gauge fixing processes 5 times , and calculate the gluon propagators on the gauge fixed configuration with largest values of @xmath46 . in fig.4 ,",
    "the transverse gluon propagators are shown for confined and deconfined phase which has a momentum of @xmath50 and propagate in the @xmath51-direction which is @xmath52 in lattice size .",
    "+ in the deconfined phase , the gluon propagator is well represented by the the free lorentz gauge gluon propagator on the lattice . while in the confined phase , the propagator shows quite different behavior as first found by nakamura@xcite at the large distance with standard action .",
    "in fig.4 it is found that the effective mass of gluon seems to increase with the distance",
    ". what is a physical meaning of this behavior should further be investigated , but we find that this is a reason why the matsubara green s function of energy momentum tensor is so noisy in the confined phase .",
    "+ acknowledgement + this work is supported by the supercomputer project ( no.97 - 27 ) of high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) . the simulation is also done on sx-4 at rcnp .",
