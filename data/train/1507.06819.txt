    "fermions and bosons play a very different role in the standard model .",
    "it is remarkable that quarks and leptons form three copies of complete multiplets of a grand unified ( gut ) group , @xmath5 or @xmath4 , whereas gauge and higgs bosons are single , incomplete , `` split '' multiplets . in the following",
    "we shall propose a model where this difference is explained by connecting gut symmetry breaking and supersymmetry breaking : scalar quarks and leptons are very heavy because they belong to complete gut multiplets , whereas supersymmetry breaking is small for gauge and higgs fields since they form incomplete gut multiplets .",
    "one is thus led to a picture similar to `` split supersymmetry '' @xcite .",
    "our discussion is based on supersymmetric theories in higher dimensions .",
    "crucial ingredients are gut symmetry breaking by wilson lines @xcite , the generation of a fermion multiplicity by magnetic flux @xcite and the associated breaking of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "interesting orbifold gut models have been constructed in five dimensions for @xmath5 @xcite and in six dimensions for @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we consider supergravity in six dimensions @xcite compactified on the orbifold @xmath6 .",
    "effects of flux and wilson lines , in particular the cancellation of anomalies due to the generated zero modes , have recently been studied in @xcite .",
    "magnetic flux also plays an important role in the stabilization of the compact dimensions @xcite .",
    "the proposed model is based on the gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "the three quark - lepton generations arise as zero modes of a bulk @xmath2-plet due to magnetic flux of the anomalous @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "supersymmetry breaking is large , and squarks and leptons are heavy . following @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite is unbroken at one orbifold fixed point and broken at the other three to standard @xmath7 @xcite , the pati - salam group @xmath8 @xcite and flipped @xmath9 @xcite , respectively .",
    "the intersection of these groups is the standard model gauge group , and the zero modes of bulk fields uncharged under the anomalous @xmath3 form @xmath10 gauge and higgs split multiplets .",

    "our starting point is a supersymmetric @xmath4 model in six dimensions compactified on the orbifold @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to a vector multiplet in the adjoint representation @xmath11 , the model contains several hypermultiplets in the representations @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a strong constraint on the consistency of the model is the cancellation of bulk anomalies .",
    "the anomaly polynomial is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the @xmath4 field strength , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the multiplicities of the indicated representations .",
    "note that we have expressed all traces in terms of the trace in the @xmath21 representation , i.e.  @xmath22 .",
    "the components of the vector multiplet can be split into the components of a 4d @xmath23 vector multiplet @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and a chiral multiplet @xmath26 , where @xmath27 forms a 6d weyl fermion .",
    "correspondingly , a hypermultiplet @xmath28 splits into two chiral multiplets , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are different , left - handed 4d weyl fermions .",
    "with respect to a @xmath33 charge the hypermultiplet , one of the chiral multiplets and the associated complex scalar carry the same charge , hence these fields are all denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the second chiral multiplet and the associated complex scalar carry opposite charge and are therefore denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "the orbifold compactification breaks the @xmath35 symmetry of the bulk to @xmath36 via the boundary conditions @xmath37 where the @xmath38 are parities of the fields @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",

    "such a gut model has indeed been studied , with six @xmath48-plets @xmath49 , two @xmath2-plets @xmath50 , @xmath51 and two @xmath52-plets @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ggstructure ] ) .",
    "this is achieved by generalizing the boundary conditions @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 are matrices breaking @xmath4 to the respective subgroups .",
    "the decompositions of the @xmath4 representations with respect to these subgroups read @xmath63 the intersection of the groups @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 contains the standard model group with an additional @xmath33 factor , @xmath67 , and the various hypermultiplet intersections yield standard model representations .",
    "the parities @xmath68 can be chosen such that the zero modes of the @xmath48-plets are higgs doublets and color triplets , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ; the zero modes of one of the @xmath2-plets and the @xmath52-plets are weak doublets , color triplets and singlets,@xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite . at each fixed point",

    "the various vector - like exotics can become massive .    in the model described in @xcite ,",
    "three @xmath2-plets are introduced at the three fixed points @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "they contain the quarks and leptons of the standard model , in standard notation @xmath81 .",
    "hence , the chiral matter of the standard model is introduced as brane fields , unrelated to the bulk fields .",
    "in contrast , we shall pursue in the following a different approach in which the @xmath82 are not independent fields but rather zero modes of the bulk field @xmath50 generated by the flux of an anomalous @xmath33 .",
    "we therefore extend the bulk gauge group to @xmath0 , assign charge @xmath83 to @xmath50 and charge zero to all other fields .",
    "the total gauge field is @xmath84 and the covariant derivative for the @xmath2-plet reads @xmath85 .",
    "this leads to a mixed bulk anomaly . from the general expressions",
    "@xcite one easily obtains @xmath86 in addition , a fixed point anomaly is generated , @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 is a sum of @xmath90-functions located at the four orbifold fixed points , and @xmath91 is the volume - form of the orbifold .",

    "the bulk and fixed point anomalies and can be canceled by a generalization of the green - schwarz mechanism @xcite .",
    "the bulk part is factorizable and hence can be canceled in the standard way .",
    "moreover , additional localized terms allow to cancel the fixed point anomalies , c.f .",
    "@xcite .",
    "accounting for the @xmath4 symmetry breaking at @xmath93 , the fixed point anomaly becomes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath94 in order to cancel the additional contributions , further localized terms transforming in the various @xmath4 subgroups have to be included in the green - schwarz counter term .",
    "we expect that it is possible to cancel all the gauge anomalies in this way .",
    "in fact , there are examples of similar , anomaly free 6d supergravity theories , e.g.  a 6d @xmath95 model that was obtained as an intermediate step in a compactification of the heterotic string @xcite .",
    "note that also torus compactifications of type i string theory can lead to the pattern of  split supersymmetry \" , see @xcite .",
    "since the focus of this paper is on the additional zero modes generated by bulk magnetic flux , we shall ignore the effects of @xmath4 symmetry breaking on the fixed point anomalies in the following .",
    "a complete discussion will be given in @xcite .",
    "let us now consider supergravity in six dimensions , following the discussion in @xcite .",
    "the bosonic part of the 6d supergravity action with gauge groups @xmath4 and @xmath3 is given by @xmath96 it involves the ricci scalar @xmath97 , the dilaton @xmath28 , the field strengths of the @xmath4 and @xmath3 gauge fields @xmath98 , and the field strength of the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath99 , @xmath100 here @xmath101 is a linear combination of the @xmath33 chern - simons term and localized contributions at the fixed points , @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "invariance of the action under gauge transformations , @xmath104 + d \\lambda'$ ] , requires that the tensor field transforms as @xmath105 introducing the @xmath4 chern - simons 3-form @xmath106 the anomaly polynomials and correspond , up to local counter terms and a normalization , to the anomaly @xmath107 where we have introduced the parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , with @xmath111 the dimension of the representation charged under the anomalous @xmath3 , here @xmath112 .",
    "note that @xmath113 does not depend on @xmath114 .",
    "this fixes the green - schwarz counter term as @xmath115 we now introduce a background field with constant flux , @xmath116 neglecting the dependence of the gauge fields @xmath117 and @xmath118 on the coordinates of the compact dimensions , one obtains from eq .",
    "the 4d anomaly @xmath119 it contains the effect of the 4d zero modes generated by the flux and the boundary conditions . in a consistent truncation , where off - diagonal terms are set to zero , we decompose the redefined tensor field @xmath120 @xcite as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a real scalar field .",
    "the axion transforms as @xmath123 under 4d gauge transformations .    with this truncation",
    "the decomposition of the field strength @xmath124 reads @xmath125 consequently , there is a @xmath126 contribution from the kinetic term of the 3-from @xmath124 , which has to be regularized . in the following we use a regularization that is compatible with anomaly cancellation .",
    "a full description depends on the uv completion resolving the orbifold singularities and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is now straightforward to evaluate the gauge part of the action and the green - schwarz term in the case of background flux , i.e.  for the gauge fields @xmath117 and @xmath127 , following @xcite . performing dimensional reduction , replacing radion and dilaton by the real scalar fields @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 and dualizing the antisymmetric tensor @xmath131 to the real scalar @xmath132 , @xmath133 one finally arrives at @xmath134 =              \\int_{m\\times x } \\big(&-\\frac{1}{2 } e^{2\\phi } h \\wedge \\ast h - \\frac{1}{2 } e^\\phi \\text{tr } ( \\tilde f \\wedge",

    "one easily verifies that the total 4d action is gauge invariant , i.e.  @xmath138 .",
    "hence the chiral anomaly induced by the @xmath3 flux is indeed canceled by the green - schwarz term .    for a bulk flux @xmath139",
    "one obtains @xmath140 left - handed @xmath4 16-plets @xmath82 as zero - modes .",
    "their chiral anomaly is canceled by the green - schwarz term . after performing the wilson - line breaking of @xmath4 to the standard model gauge group ,",
    "an additional doublet @xmath141 associated with @xmath50 ( see sec .  [ sec:6dguts ] ) remains as a zero modes .",
    "it is not immediately obvious why this happens and why the @xmath140 16-plets induced by the flux are not projected by the wilson - line breaking .",
    "an important consistency check is the anomaly cancellation discussed above , and a more detailed picture is obtained by considering the zero - mode wave functions . for a @xmath33 bulk flux the effect has been worked out in @xcite .",
    "the orbifold projection of @xmath142 to @xmath143 yields for each 6d weyl fermion one chiral 4d fermion . without flux most zero modes of the 16-plet",
    "are projected out except for the doublet @xmath141 . with flux one",
    "obtains @xmath144 zero modes for each mode that survives the wilson - line breaking , and @xmath140 zero modes for each mode that is projected out by the wilson lines .",
    "altogether one then obtains @xmath140 16-plets and one doublet ( @xmath141 ) as zero modes .",
    "note that the fields contained in the 16-plets develop different wave function profiles corresponding to their transformation properties with respect to the standard model subgroups of @xmath4 .",
    "a detailed description of the @xmath4 wave functions will be given in @xcite .",
    "the action contains two axions , @xmath122 and @xmath132 .",
    "one linear combination gives mass to the vector boson @xmath145 , whereas a second linear combination , @xmath146 , plays the role of a massless axion .",
    "the vector boson mass and the specific form of the linear combinations depend on the details of the regularization , the vacuum expectation values of the moduli fields @xmath129 and @xmath128 , and the number of flux quanta @xmath147 .",
    "the massless combination @xmath146 couples to the massive @xmath33 vector boson @xmath118 and to the massless gauge fields of the standard model , as qualitatively described by the action @xmath148 note that @xmath146 receives a mass through non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "again , the parameters @xmath149 and @xmath150 are sensitive to the short distance behavior of the compactification . for a pure @xmath33 theory",
    "these quantities have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "in this section we briefly comment on phenomenological aspects of the proposed model .",
    "a definite prediction is the flavor structure of the quark and lepton mass matrices . at the different fixed points the various higgs fields",
    "are projected to representation of the respective @xmath4 subgroups , @xmath151 where we have also indicated the doublets @xmath152 and @xmath153 of the mssm , which are contained as zero modes .",
    "furthermore , we denote here and in the following the representations of @xmath154 with a tilde in order to distinguish them from the representations of @xmath65 .",
    "the three @xmath155-plets , @xmath156 , of zero modes have the decomposition @xmath157 where we have suppressed the @xmath33 charges and the @xmath158 transformation properties which are given in eqs .   and , respectively .",
    "the field @xmath51 , which transforms also in the @xmath159 of @xmath4 , decomposes in the same way . for later reference",
    "we introduce the following notation for some components of @xmath160 : @xmath161    at the fixed points , the @xmath35 supersymmetry of the bulk is broken to @xmath23 supersymmetry .",
    "hence , superpotential terms of the type @xmath162 and @xmath163 are allowed .",
    "they carry charge @xmath164 with respect to @xmath3 , which can be compensated in the standard way by an exponential term involving the two axions . in the following",
    "we suppress the axion dependence in the quark and lepton couplings .",
    "the fixed point superpotential is determined by the symmetry breaking at @xmath93 , @xmath165 at each fixed point , the superpotential couplings of the bulk fields induce matrices @xmath166 of couplings between the zero modes @xmath155 , which are given by the products of the zero mode wave functions at the respective fixed point . since some wave functions vanish at certain fixed points , the matrices @xmath166 have a certain number of zero entries .",
    "hence , one obtains `` textures '' which are determined by the local symmetry breaking patterns . from eq .",
    "one obtains the 4d superpotential @xmath167 inserting the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields , @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , yields the quark and lepton mass matrices @xmath171 which can be read off from eq .  .",
    "the detailed predictions for quark and lepton masses and the ckm and pmns mixing matrices will be described in @xcite .    for three quark - lepton generations",
    "the number of orbifold flux quanta is @xmath172 , and the masses of squarks and sleptons are given by @xcite @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the volume of the compact dimensions .",
    "thus , @xmath175 is a dynamical quantity which depends on the moduli fields .",
    "the corresponding moduli stabilization has to be consistent with the unification of gauge couplings and proton decay . at tree level , gravitino , gauginos , higgsinos and higgs bosons",
    "are massless .",
    "the flux corresponds to a d - term breaking of supersymmetry @xcite , and quantum corrections will generate masses for all theses particles . for @xmath176 , one would have @xmath177 . since at tree level gaugino masses are protected by an r - symmetry and the higgsino masses by a pq symmetry , one has @xmath178 this mass hierarchy is realized in split supersymmetry with gauginos in the tev range @xcite or in `` spread supersymmetry '' with heavier gauginos and a higgsino lsp @xcite .",
    "the details of the mass spectrum depend on the treatment of quantum corrections , in particular the contribution from anomaly mediation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may be left just with the standard model and an axion .",
    "a well - known problem of split supersymmetry is the fine - tuning of the higgs potential , not to mention the cosmological constant .",
