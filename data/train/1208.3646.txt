    "structurally , iron based superconductors are layered materials , in which feas ( or iron chalcogenide ) layer is the main building block for a variety of compounds @xcite . since the dominant contribution to the density of states at the fermi level comes from the iron 3d orbitals , one can expect a significant electronic anisotropy of the compounds revealed in the in - plane and out - of - plane transport .",
    "contrary to this expectation , the most studied families of iron arsenides , those based on bafe@xmath12as@xmath12 , have rather low anisotropy ratio @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15/@xmath16 @xmath104 at @xmath17 @xcite . in transition",

    "another interesting feature of iron arsenides that distinguishes them from the copper oxide based ( cuprate ) superconductors @xcite is a strong variation of the functional form of temperature - dependent resistivity for various types and levels of dopings .",
    "the general trend of @xmath3 evolution is the presence of a @xmath20linear region immediately above @xmath17 for optimally doped compositions @xcite . at higher temperatures this @xmath8-linear behavior , for example in hole - doped ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath12as@xmath12 and in self - doped na@xmath0feas ,",
    "is terminated by the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "systematic studies of the temperature - dependent electrical resistivity are very important for the general understanding of superconductivity in this family of materials .",
    "scattering in the normal state in the vicinity of the magnetic quantum critical point leads to the characteristic @xmath20linear temperature dependence of @xmath3 , which then evolves towards fermi - liquid @xmath21 behavior with doping ( see ref .  [ ] for a review ) .",
    "deviations from this general behavior provide an insight into electronic and magnetic correlations @xcite , in particular , into the mechanism of nematic state formation @xcite .",
    "in this article we report the systematics of doping - evolution of in - plane and inter - plane resistivity of electron - doped na@xmath0fe@xmath1co@xmath2as .",
    "this compound shows a `` dome - like '' phase diagram which is very similar to baco122 @xcite . as such",
    ", this study brings additional insight into the scattering and correlation phenomena of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "ac magnetic characterization of the samples was performed with a tunnel - diode resonator , ( tdr)@xcite .",
    "briefly , tdr is a self - oscillating @xmath22 tank circuit powered by a properly biased tunnel diode .",
    "the sample is mounted with apiezon n - grease on a sapphire rod and is inserted in the inductor ( coil ) .",
    "the sample temperature is controlled independent of the resonant circuit , which is actively stabilized at the constant temperature .",
    "the measured frequency shift is proportional to the differential magnetic susceptibility of the sample @xcite . in this work , for quick mounting and measurement protocols we used a simplified version of the tdr susceptometer ( a `` dipper '' ) , which is inserted directly into a transport @xmath23he dewar and gives very quick",
    "turn - around measurement time of typically 30  minutes per sample .",
    "the trade - off of this quick measurement protocol is reduced stability and higher temperature - dependent background as compared to our high - stability @xmath24he and dilution refrigerator versions of the tdr susceptometer . nevertheless , the `` dipper '' is perfectly suitable to study magnetic signature of the superconducting transition .",
    "single crystals of na(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)as with @xmath25 0 , 0.025 , 0.05 , 0.08 , and 0.10 were synthesized by sealing a mixture of na , fe , as , and co together in ta tubes and heating it to 950 @xmath26c , followed by 5 @xmath26c / hour cooling down to 900 @xmath26c @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 in samples was defined as the nominal ratio , which gives some variation with electron - probe microanalysis values @xcite .",
    "the samples were stored and transported in sealed containers filled with inert gas .",
    "sample preparation was done quickly in air within about 5 minutes to minimize uncontrolled environmental exposure which can induce an increase of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we started sample preparation by cleaving slabs from the inner part of the crystals with typical a thickness of 50 to 100 @xmath27 m .",
    "the slabs had shiny cleavage surfaces and were further cut into smaller pieces for tdr ( typically 0.5@xmath280.5mm@xmath29 ) and resistivity measurements . cleaved internal parts of single crystals did not show any visible reaction with air and turned out to be relatively stable , contrary to crystals with the residue of naas flux , which aggressively reacts with air and moisture .",
    "after preparation , samples were promptly measured and immediately stored after measurements in inert and dry environment .",
    "after each dipper run samples were washed with toluene to remove remaining n - grease in order to control the air exposure .",
    "samples for in - plane resistivity measurements had typical dimensions of ( 1 - 2)@xmath280.5@xmath28(0.02 - 0.1 ) mm@xmath24 .",
    "all sample dimensions were measured with an optical microscope with an accuracy of about 10% .",
    "sample resistivity at room temperature , @xmath30 , was in the range 400 to 500 @xmath31 for all compositions studied .",
    "this value is obtained on a bigger array of samples than in our previous study @xcite and is somewhat higher .",
    "it is also somewhat higher than values found in electron- @xcite and hole - doped @xcite ba122 compounds , typically 300 @xmath31 or less .",
    "we do not have sufficient array of data to obtain lower error bars needed to resolve the doping evolution of @xmath30 , if any exists .",
    "contacts for four - probe resistivity measurements were made by soldering 50 @xmath27 m silver wires with ultra - pure sn solder , as described in ref .",
    "resistivity measurements were performed in @xmath32 ppms , providing magnetic fields up to 9  t. for measurements of the upper critical field , @xmath33 , samples were glued to the side of a plastic block with @xmath34 plane of the sample oriented to be either parallel or perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field ( with an accuracy of about 1@xmath35 ) .",
    "inter - plane resistivity measurements were done using the two - probe technique , relying on very low contact resistance of soldered contacts , typically in the 10 @xmath36 range .",
    "the top and bottom surfaces of the @xmath34-plane ( typically 0.5@xmath280.5mm@xmath29 area ) of the samples were covered with sn solder forming a capacitor - like structure .",
    "a four - probe scheme was used to measure a sample with contacts , giving a sum of series connected sample , @xmath37 , and contact resistance , @xmath38 resistances . since @xmath39 , contact resistance represents a minor portion , on the order of 1 - 5% on the total resistance .",
    "this can be directly seen for our samples for temperatures below the superconducting @xmath17 , where @xmath400 and the measured resistance represents @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "further details of the measurement procedure can be found in refs .  .",
    "the drawback of the measurement of samples with @xmath41 is that any structural and chemical inhomogeneity along the @xmath42axis , a very common problem in soft and micaceous samples of iron arsenide superconductors @xcite , not only increases sample resistance , but admixes in - plane component due to the redistribution of the current .",
    "one way to ascertain correctness of the @xmath43 measurements , is to rely on measurements with the lowest resistivity values .",
    "typically the best results were obtained on the thinnest slabs . to get reliable results we performed measurements of @xmath44 on at least 5 samples of each batch . in all cases we obtained qualitatively similar temperature dependences of the normalized electrical resistivity , @xmath45 .",
    "the resistivity value at room temperature , @xmath46 , however , showed a notable scatting and was typically in the range 2000 to 3000 @xmath36  cm at room temperature .",
