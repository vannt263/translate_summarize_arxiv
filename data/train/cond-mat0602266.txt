    "thin fluid films have a broad range of applications in technology as lubricants , protecting layers , for production processes of layered structures in microelectronics , etc .",
    "in particular , ultra - thin films have become extremely important in the context of nanotechnology @xcite .",
    "the interplay of surface effects and finite - size effects with the bulk behavior of these systems poses challenging theoretical problems @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting problem in this context is the phase separation of binary ( or multi - component ) mixtures in thin films , as most materials of practical interest have more than one component , e.g. , metallic alloys , ceramics , polymer blends , etc .",
    "phase changes in reduced geometries ( e.g. , 2-@xmath1 systems ) differ in many aspects from the bulk behavior in three dimensions .",
    "the interplay between surface and bulk behavior leads to complex phenomena such as wetting transitions , prewetting and layering transitions , etc .",
    "@xcite . these transitions may compete with phase changes that occur in the bulk , such as phase separation in mixtures @xcite .",
    "there has been intense study of phenomena such as _ surface - directed spinodal decomposition _ ( sdsd ) or _ surface - directed phase separation _",
    "@xcite , but our theoretical understanding of these problems is still incomplete .    to gain a better understanding of sdsd in thin fluid films ,",
    "we have undertaken a comprehensive molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of binary mixtures in a slit pore .",
    "a preliminary account of our results has been published as a letter @xcite . in this paper , we present detailed results from this study .",
    "our md simulations are based on a symmetric binary ( ab ) lennard - jones ( lj ) mixture , for which the bulk phase diagram has been determined to high accuracy @xcite .",
    "we also have a good understanding of various other properties of this mixture , e.g. , static and dynamic response and correlation functions , transport coefficients @xcite , and the interfacial tension between coexisting a - rich and b - rich phases @xcite .",
    "many previous simulation studies of phase - separation kinetics in a thin - film geometry @xcite have used ginzburg - landau ( gl ) models , and hence lack any direct connection to a microscopic description .",
    "our present modeling bridges the gap between the atomistic description of liquids and the mesoscale domain structures that form as the kinetics of phase separation proceeds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this direct approach has the further merit that hydrodynamic interactions are automatically incorporated .",
    "it is well - known that these interactions have a pronounced effect on the kinetics of domain growth @xcite .    in order to account for hydrodynamics in the framework of gl models ,",
    "rather extensive computations are required @xcite .",
    "the gl approach is appropriate if one is primarily concerned with the scaling behavior of the late - stage domain growth @xcite . but recent work based on lattice boltzmann simulations questions the quantitative validity of gl models , and reports very slow crossovers extending over many decades in time @xcite ( however , a `` somewhat narrower '' crossover region was reported in a subsequent work @xcite ) .",
    "this study also raises questions about some of the previous work on this problem , using the lattice boltzmann method or related `` lattice gas''-approximations to the navier - stokes equations of hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "however , the lattice boltzmann description is even more remote from an atomistic description of matter than the gl model .",
    "further , it is not clear how one incorporates the proper boundary conditions with respect to complete or partial wetting in such an approach @xcite .",
    "the studies mentioned above are primarily concerned with domain growth in @xmath2 . for the @xmath3 case , it is even controversial @xcite to what extent a scaling behavior describes the late stages of coarsening . in view of these problems , it is useful to undertake an md simulation despite the fact that the accessible scales in length and time are limited .",
    "earlier md studies of bulk phase separation @xcite have addressed coarsening in @xmath2 and in @xmath3 , but the latter work is somewhat inconclusive @xcite .",
    "further , there have only been preliminary md studies of sdsd in thin films @xcite .",

    "a homogeneous binary mixture becomes unstable to phase separation when it is quenched into the miscibility gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . for a symmetric mixture ,",
    "the miscibility gap is symmetric with respect to the concentration @xmath4 .    at the surface of a semi - infinite mixture ,",
    "one may encounter a wetting transition @xcite .",
    "this transition implies a singular behavior of the surface excess free energy @xmath5 , which is defined as ( for a film between two walls at distance @xmath0 ) @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the bulk free energy of the system .",
    "assuming , as done in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , that the wetting transition occurs at the surface of b - rich mixtures ( caused by the preferential attraction of a - particles to the walls ) , the transition is characterized by a divergence of the surface excess concentration of a , @xmath9 .",

    "infinitely thick a - rich wetting layer coating the wall , separated from the b - rich bulk by a flat interface .    at the coexistence curve @xmath16 ,",
    "the surface excess free energy is that of an a - rich phase @xmath17 if the wall is nonwet . for a wet wall , we have @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the interfacial tension between coexisting a - rich and b - rich phases",
    ". these quantities also determine the contact angle @xmath20 at which an a - b interface in the nonwet region meets the wall @xcite @xmath21 if the state of the system is changed such that one increases the temperature but stays always at the coexistence curve @xmath22 , one encounters a wetting transition at temperature @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , where the state of the wall changes from nonwet @xmath24 to wet @xmath25 .",
    "this transition may be of second order ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) or first order ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) . in the second - order case",
    ", @xmath9 diverges continuously when @xmath26 , while otherwise there is a discontinuous jump in @xmath9 from a finite value at @xmath27 to @xmath28 at @xmath29 . in the first - order case",
    ", there is also a prewetting transition in the one - phase region ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) , where the thickness of the a - rich surface layer jumps from a smaller value to a larger ( but finite ) value .",
    "this line of prewetting transitions ends in a prewetting critical point .",
    "this brief review of wetting phenomena provides the basis to understand the equilibrium behavior of binary mixtures in thin films @xcite . if the walls are neutral ( i.e. , it has the same attractive interactions with both a - particles and b - particles ) , the critical concentration remains @xmath30 .",
    "however , the critical temperature @xmath31 is lowered @xcite relative to the bulk : @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xcite is the critical exponent of the correlation length @xmath34 of concentration fluctuations ( in the universality class of the @xmath2 ising model ) .",
    "note , however , that critical correlations at fixed finite @xmath0 can become arbitrarily long - range only in the lateral direction parallel to the film .",
    "thus , the transition at @xmath31 belongs to the class of the @xmath3 ising model .",
    "the states below the coexistence curve of the thin film correspond to two - phase equilibria characterized by lateral phase separation .",
    "when there is a preferential attraction of a - particles to the walls , the phase diagram of the thin film is no longer symmetric with respect to @xmath35 , although we did assume such a symmetry in the bulk .",
    "the shift of @xmath36 and the resulting change of the coexistence curve , is the analog of _ capillary condensation of gases _",
    "@xcite for binary mixtures .",
    "the coexisting phases in the region below the coexistence curve of the thin film are inhomogeneous in the direction perpendicular to the walls ( see fig .  [",
    "fig2]c ) . in the a - rich phase ,",
    "we expect only a slight enhancement of the order parameter @xmath37 , which is defined in terms of the densities @xmath38 , @xmath39 of a and b particles as @xmath40 in the b - rich phase , however , we expect pronounced enrichment layers . as @xmath7 , the thickness of these layers diverges for @xmath41 but stays finite for @xmath42 . in a film of finite thickness , the width of a - rich surface layers also stays finite , e.g. , for @xmath43 for short - range surface forces , while @xmath44 for non - retarded van der waals forces @xcite .",
    "thus , the wetting transition is always rounded off in a thin film . the prewetting line ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) does have an analog in films of finite thickness @xmath0 , for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "this transition splits into a two - phase region at small @xmath45 between the thin - film triple point and the thin - film critical point on the b - rich side .",
    "this two - phase region corresponds to a coexistence between b - rich phases with a - rich surface layers , both of which have finite ( but different ) thickness .",
    "as @xmath7 , the thin - film critical point on the b - rich side moves into the prewetting critical point , while the thin - film triple point merges with the first - order wetting transition . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath0 becomes small , the thin - film critical point and the thin - film triple point may merge and annihilate each other .",
    "for still smaller",
    "@xmath0 , the thin - film phase diagram then has the shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , although one has first - order wetting in the semi - infinite bulk ( fig .  [ fig2]b ) .    finally , we comment on the state encountered below the bulk coexistence curve , but above the coexistence curve of the thin film .",
    "when one crosses the bulk coexistence curve , there is a _ rounded transition _ towards a layered ( stratified ) structure with two a - rich layers at the walls and a b - rich layer in the middle .",
    "the temperature range over which this rounded transition is smeared is also of order @xmath46 around @xmath47 .",
    "hence , for large @xmath0 , this segregation in the direction normal to the walls may easily be mistaken ( in experiments or simulations ) as a true ( sharp ) phase transition .",
    "we stress that this is not a true transition ",
    "one is still in the one - phase region of the thin film , although the structure is strongly inhomogeneous !",
    "the situation qualitatively looks like the concentration profile shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "the difference is that , for @xmath7 , the thickness of true wetting layers scales sub - linearly with @xmath0 , as noted above .",
    "however , for phase separation in the normal direction which gradually sets in when one crosses the bulk coexistence curve , one simply has a - rich domains of macroscopic dimensions ( proportional to @xmath0 ) adjacent to both walls .",
    "unfortunately , the layers resulting in this stratified structure are often referred to as `` wetting layers '' in the literature , although this is completely misleading .",
    "we reiterate that a - rich wetting layers only form when a b - rich domain extends to the surface , which is not the case here .",
    "we also caution the reader that a picture in terms of a - rich layers at the walls and a b - rich domain in the inside of the film is an over - simplification because the thickness of the domain walls can not really be neglected in the region @xmath48 , where a stratified structure occurs in equilibrium .",
    "this is seen from the relation @xmath49 , in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , which shows that @xmath50 at @xmath31 .",
    "thus , domains and domain walls are not well - distinguished in the region under consideration , since the interfacial width is @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "when the interface between a - rich and b - rich domains is treated as a sharp kink ( this approximation is popular in theoretical treatments of wetting @xcite ) , one might think that a sharp wetting transition could still be described in terms of the vanishing of the contact angle @xmath20 as @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "however , it is clear that for a correct treatment the finite width of the interface needs to be taken into account .",
    "thus , for finite @xmath0 , the contact angle in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c is ill - defined , and the transition between the two states depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c is smooth , because a b - rich nonwet domain may also have a thin a - rich layer at its surface ( @xmath9 , in general , is nonzero ) .",
    "one should also note that the contact `` line '' is distorted by line tension effects when it hits the wall , and the line tension of the interface at the wall would also modify eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of estimating the contact angle in finite geometries is well - known from studies of nanoscopic droplets @xcite .",
    "the central conclusion in this subsection is that in the final equilibrium to which , for times @xmath53 and for small @xmath0 , the thin film evolves , there is no fundamental difference whether or not we are above or below the wetting transition temperature , but it matters whether @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "next , we review our understanding of the kinetics of phase separation in bulk fluid mixtures which are rendered thermodynamically unstable by a rapid quench ( at @xmath56 ) into the miscibility gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . the initial state ( @xmath57 is spatially homogeneous , apart from small - scale concentration inhomogeneities .",
    "the final equilibrium state consists of macroscopic domains of the two coexisting phases , with relative amounts determined by the lever rule .",
    "we are interested in the evolution from the initial homogeneous state to the final segregated state . for quenches below the spinodal curve ,",
    "the homogeneous system is unstable and decomposes via the spontaneous growth of long - wavelength concentration fluctuations @xcite ( _ spinodal decomposition _ ) .",
    "understanding the full time evolution from the initial stages to the late stages of coarsening is a formidable problem , and is typically accessed by large - scale simulations of coarse - grained models .",
    "nevertheless , there exist some cases in which simple domain growth laws can be obtained from analytical considerations @xcite .",
    "the _ evaporation - condensation mechanism _ of lifshitz and slyozov ( ls ) @xcite corresponds to a situation where a population of droplets of the minority phase ( say , a ) is in local equilibrium with the surrounding supersaturated majority phase .",
    "the ls mechanism leads to a growth law ( valid for dimensionality @xmath58 ) @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the linear dimension of the droplets .",
    "the droplet _ diffusion - coagulation mechanism _",
    "@xcite is specific to fluid mixtures , and is based on stokes law for the diffusion of droplets , yielding @xcite @xmath62 .",
    "a faster mechanism of domain growth in fluids was proposed by siggia @xcite , who studied the coarsening of interconnected domain structures via the deformation and break - up of tube - like regions , considering a balance between the surface energy density @xmath63 and the viscous stress @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , or @xmath67 in @xmath2 . in @xmath3 ,",
    "the analog of this hydrodynamic mechanism is controversial .",

    "however , recently there is growing evidence @xcite that different characteristic length scales in @xmath3 may exhibit different growth exponents , suggesting that there is no simple dynamical scaling of domain growth in @xmath3 !",
    "finally , we remark that the above growth laws do not constitute the true asymptotic behavior , either in @xmath3 or @xmath2 .",

    "this is done by rescaling the velocities , and by setting the temperature of the nos - hoover thermostat to the new temperature .",

    "of course , in a more realistic model , this thermostatting action of the walls applies only to those fluid particles which are close to one of the walls , and not on particles near the center of the film ( which are only thermostatted indirectly via heat conduction ) . in situations",
    "far from local equilibrium ( such as strongly sheared fluids @xcite ) , there is indeed a noticeable difference between the effects of wall thermostats and the nos - hoover thermostat .",

    "only very thin films are accessible  the distance between the origins of the wall potentials was @xmath246 in units of the lj parameter .",
    "further , the finite size of the lateral linear dimension @xmath165 ( @xmath166 for @xmath128 , and @xmath167 for @xmath168 ) constrains our work to the early and intermediate stages of domain growth . in this regime ,",
    "the characteristic length scale of lateral phase separation @xmath224 has grown by approximately one decade .",

    "the interfaces are locally sharp ( with a correlation length @xmath248 ) , and the time - scale for structural relaxation in the fluids is manageable for md work . the shear viscosity has been estimated previously @xcite to be @xmath161 at @xmath157 , in the standard lj units .",
    "thus , the advantages of the present approach are as follows : ( a ) all material parameters of the model are explicitly known ; ( b ) at small scales , a qualitatively reasonable description of fluid structure is ensured ; and ( c ) long - range hydrodynamic interactions ( resulting from the conservation laws in fluid dynamics ) are automatically included , although only a short - range lj potential is chosen to model the interaction among the point particles .",
    "we use this model to elucidate all the main characteristics of sdsd .",
    "the surfaces become the origin of sdsd waves , which consist of alternating enrichment and depletion layers of the preferred component a. these waves coalesce in the central region of the film , giving rise to a layered structure  see the @xmath217 profile in fig .  [",
