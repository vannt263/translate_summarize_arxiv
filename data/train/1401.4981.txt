    "the beam pointing noise is an issue impacting the performance of various optical systems .",
    "complexity of high power lasers systems usually creates rather unstable pointing performance which can be a major issue for their applications @xcite .",
    "pointing stabilization can be necessary in many areas of physics such as atom optical trapping @xcite , microscopy @xcite or free - space laser communication @xcite .",
    "it can also be a major source of technical noise in km - scale interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors .",
    "indeed , it was identified at an early stage that in case of geometrical asymmetries between the arms of the interferometer ( itf ) , created by spurious misalignments of itf optics , the input beam jitter in the detector frequency bandwidth ( 10hz-10khz ) creates a phase noise directly affecting detector sensitivity  @xcite . in order to mitigate this effect ,",
    "the input beam jitter is filtered out by means of a mode cleaning cavity . despite this precaution",
    ", the commissioning of the first generation of gw detectors showed that the input beam fluctuations can be a limiting technical noise especially for frequencies around 100  hz .",
    "this could be even worse for the second generation of detectors @xcite where jitter specifications at low frequency become even more stringent because of the radiation pressure effects  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fluctuations of beam pointing at low frequencies ( dc-10hz ) can impact the itf lock accuracy , which indirectly degrades the detector sensitivity @xcite .",
    "in this paper the specifications of input beam jitter over the whole frequency band of the @xmath4 generation detector advanced virgo ( dc-10khz ) will be evaluated . a system to monitor the input beam jitter and to estimate the compliance of measured jitter noise with respect to the specifications",
    "will then be described .",
    "finally the control system , the _ beam pointing control _ ( bpc ) system , used to deal with the low frequency large fluctuation of the pointing , due to air flux and thermal drift will be detailed , showing also the control performance .",
    "figure  [ optlay ] shows the general scheme of the advanced virgo double recycled michelson interferometer .",
    "the laser source and some part of the input optics system are placed on a set of in - air optical benches where they experience jitter noise due to spurious electro - optical effects , vibrations , thermal fluctuations and air flux variations before being sent through the suspended in - vacuum optical system . after entering the vacuum system",
    ", the beam passes through a triangular mode cleaning cavity ( imc ) and is then mode matched onto the long arm fabry - perot cavities using a set of shaping optics .",
    "the gravitational wave signal is obtained from the dark fringe of the michelson which is filtered by means of an output mode cleaner cavity ( omc ) .",
    "+ the beam jitter at the input of the imc impacts the detector performance in different ways depending on the perturbation frequency . in this section , the calculation of the jitter requirements in the detection frequency band ( from 10 hz to khz ) and at lower frequencies ( dc-10hz ) will be carried out .      in this section",
    "the method that has been used to compute the beam jitter requirements for advanced virgo at the interferometer ( itf ) input , i.e. at the level of the power recycling mirror ( pr ) , will be described .",
    "the requirements at the imc input will then be determined taking into account the imc and the shaping optics properties .",
    "+ the jitter of the itf input beam couples into the dark fringe signal through optical asymmetries between the two arms of the interferometer and therefore it mainly couples through the residual rms tilt motion of the core optics  @xcite .",
    "+    .[tab_alignmentrms ] angular requirements for advanced virgo for the arm cavity modes ( the ( + ) and ( - ) modes ) and for the central interferometer mirrors , beam splitter ( bs ) , power recycling ( prm ) and signal recycling ( srm ) mirrors . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the _ control _ ( c ) is given by the control matrix , the correctors , the driving matrix and the actuator transfer functions .",
    "the control matrix provides the relation between the set of quadrant signals and the set of input beam displacements .",
    "it s entries are the low frequency limit of the transfer functions between the input beam displacements and the quadrant signals ( see table  [ table : sensing ] ) .",
    "the bpc corrections are computed by filtering the error signals with properly designed control filters ( correctors ) which are sent then to the driving matrix to define the correction voltages to drive the piezo - electric actuators .",
    "20  hz for the tilt direction and @xmath51  hz for the shift direction.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the control filters for the shift and tilt are shown in figure  [ fig : olclfilt ] .",
    "the unity gain frequency of the two loops is @xmath5 20  hz for the tilt direction ( black curve ) and @xmath51  hz for the shift direction ( red curve ) .",
    "the control filters , developed for the bpc control , are very simple and robust . from the open loop transfer function",
    "it can be seen that they demonstrated a large margin of improvement , the u.g.f .",
    "could be indeed increased to @xmath5100  hz for both directions , which is not necessary for the purpose of this study , since the system is already compliant with the control accuracy and noise requirements , but it could be useful for other applications .",
    "+ the acquisition of the error signals and the generation of the corrections is made trough a digital signal processor ( dsp ) with a sampling rate of 10  khz .",
    "as discussed in the previous section the bpc system has a dual purpose .",
    "the first is to mitigate the jitter at low frequency in order to not degrade the overall itf alignment ( see section  [ sec : accreq ] ) .",
    "the second is to monitor the beam jitter at the level of the imc . in this section the performance of the experimental apparatus",
    "will be compared with the advanced virgo requirements .",
    "the low frequency performance of the control is shown in figure  [ fig : olcl ] . the beam shift and tilt spectra at the level of the imc in the case of open and closed control loop ( red and blue curve respectively ) for all the four d.o.f .",
    "are shown .",
    "the spectra have been computed with a statistical approach setting a confidence threshold of 95% ( meaning that the beam displacement spectra will be below the shown curve for the 95% of the time ) .",
    "the control developed for the bpc fully fulfills the rms requirements , computed in section [ sec : accreq ] .",
    "as it is shown in figure  [ fig : olcl ] , the closed loop rms ( the dashed blue curve ) is below the requirement ( the dashed black curve ) for all four degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , the fact that the open and closed loop curves start to overlap above 1  hz means that the re - introduction of control noise can be considered negligible in the detection bandwidth ( above 10  hz ) as it will be described in the following .",
    "the open loop signals are used to monitor the effective displacement of the beam at the input of the imc above 10  hz ( see red curves in figure  [ fig : perfodetband ] ) and have been compared with the advanced virgo requirements evaluated in section  [ sec : highfrequreq ] ( black curves ) .",
    "the sensing is limited by the quadrant sensor noise , dashed red lines in figure  [ fig : perfodetband ] , and it is compliant with the advanced virgo requirements for all the four d.o.f .. + it is worth noting that the displacement measurements performed in the laboratory ( red curves in figure  [ fig : perfodetband ] ) show structures related to the optical mount resonances excited by the environmental noise of the laboratory , mainly acoustic noise , which is expected to be lower for advanced virgo due to the implementation of acoustic enclosures surrounding the optical bench .",
    "in this paper a simple and very effective control system to monitor and suppress the beam jitter noise at the input of an optical system has been described showing the theoretical principle and an experimental demonstration for the application of large scale gravitational wave interferometers .",
    "the control system has shown unprecedented performance in terms of control accuracy and sensing noise .",
    "the bpc system has achieved a control accuracy of @xmath0  rad for the tilt and @xmath1  m for the shift and a sensing noise of less than 1  @xmath2rad resulting compliant with the advance virgo gravitational wave interferometer requirements .",

    "the authors would also like to thank alberto gennai and diego passuelo from infn - pisa for having put at our disposal all the control electronics required in this experiment .",
    "we would also like to thank alain masserot , benoit mours and the lapp group from annecy for the data acquisition system installed in our laboratory which was used in this experiment .",
