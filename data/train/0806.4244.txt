    "development of innovative tools capable of measuring the local magnetization dynamics @xmath4 inside a ferromagnetic nano - structure is an objective of primary importance .",
    "new technology fields related to magnetic materials , like spintronics , depend on one s ability to analyze and predict the out - of - equilibrium state of @xmath5 in nanoscale hybrid structures . in this respect ,",
    "models derived from microscopic principles are often limited because of the numerous degrees of freedom strongly coupled to the magnetization .",
    "hence , phenomenological approaches are often used , and require a constant comparison with experiments .",
    "several original techniques are being pursued to measure the dynamics of @xmath5 on small length scales . among them , x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) transmission microscopy @xcite , xmcd photoelectron microscopy ( peem ) @xcite , microfocus brillouin light scattering ( bls ) @xcite , time - resolved scanning kerr microscopy ( trskm ) @xcite , spin - torque driven ferromagnetic resonance ( st - fmr ) @xcite and magnetic resonance force microscopy ( mrfm ) applied to ferromagnetic resonance @xcite are the most accomplished yet .",
    "this article focuses on the last one , called herein mechanical - fmr , since a mechanical setup is used for the detection of fmr , as shown in fig.[mechanical - fmr ] . here , we shall review the ability of mechanical - fmr to extract _ quantitative _ spectroscopic information in _ individual _ samples .        in fmr ,",
    "the magnitude of the magnetization vector , @xmath6 , is a constant of the motion and equals the saturation magnetization at the lattice temperature .",
    "thus the dynamics of @xmath5 is governed by the position- and time - dependent transverse fluctuations of the magnetization direction , the so - called spin - waves ( sw ) @xcite @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the longitudinal component of the magnetization , defined as the projection of the instantaneous vector @xmath9 along the local precession ( or equilibrium ) axis of unit vector @xmath10 .",
    "because of the exchange interaction , these transverse fluctuations are a collective precession , and become more insightful once decomposed along the normal modes basis of the sample .",
    "therefore the experimental identification of this sw basis is important .",
    "its nature depends primarily on the symmetry of the equilibrium configuration of @xmath11 inside the sample @xcite . in the case of a uniformly magnetized sample",
    ", the sw confinement is mostly governed by the shape of the sample . in thin films ,",
    "the quantization of the lowest energy ( or longest wavelength ) modes develops along the finite thickness direction , whereas in nanostructures , it arises both from the thickness and lateral confinements .",
    "although , there are fundamental interests in studying the magnetization dynamics in the time domain ( or free precession regime ) , the best spectral resolution is obtained by continuous wave spectrometers , which study the harmonic response ( or forced oscillation regime ) .",
    "conventional spectrometers _ excite _ and _ detect _ the sw eigen - modes of a ferromagnetic sample with the same microwave antenna . in a conventional - fmr experiment @xcite , the sample is placed in a region where a large homogeneous static magnetic field aligns the spins in a well - defined direction . on the emission side , a small microwave field @xmath12 ,",
    "applied perpendicularly to the effective magnetic field @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , will ca nt the magnetization away from its equilibrium axis if the resonance condition is met , _",
    "i.e. _ if the photon energy ( @xmath15 ) corresponds to the energy to excite one sw or magnon ( @xmath16 )",
    ". the symmetry of the excitation antenna sets the selection rules and the symmetry of the excited sw . on the reception side ,",
    "the measured quantity in a conventional spectrometer is @xmath17 , the microwave energy absorbed inside the sample per unit of time .",
    "technically , @xmath17 is obtained by monitoring the transmitted or reflected power to a microwave diode , whose dc voltage is proportional to the incident microwave power . in metallic samples ,",
    "the absorbed power per unit of surface can be expressed as a function of @xmath18 , the complex surface impedance of the sample @xcite , which itself depends on the complex electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility . for thin magnetic layers",
    ", it mainly reduces to the dissipative part @xmath19 of the microwave transverse magnetic susceptibility , as in insulators : @xmath20 , where the shorthand notation @xmath21 represents the time derivative .",
    "the dependence of @xmath17 on either the applied magnetic field , @xmath22 , or the frequency of the excitation source , @xmath23 , reveals resonance peaks ( bell - shaped curves ) .",
    "their positions , amplitudes and line widths reflect the complete spectral information about the spin system .",
    "i ) the position is a precise measurement of the effective magnetic field defined as the conjugate variable of the magnetization , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the free energy of the spin system .",
    "ii ) the amplitude is related to the coupling ( overlap integral ) with both the excitation and the detection schemes .",
    "it thus gives a hint about the spatio - temporal profile of the mode .",
    "for instance , with a cavity ( cavity - fmr ) or a stripline antenna ( stripline - fmr ) , the microwave field @xmath12 is uniform over the sample volume . as a result",
    ", it preferentially couples to the longest wavelength sw modes of the sample .",
    "iii ) the _ frequency _ line width gives the decay rate of the excited sw ( coherent with @xmath12 ) to the other degrees of freedom : the degenerate and thermal sw ( incoherent with @xmath12 ) or the lattice ( electrons and phonons ) . in bloembergen and",
    "wang s notation @xcite , the line width is proportional to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it is often easier to monitor the dependence of @xmath17 when @xmath22 is swept at fixed @xmath27 . in this case , it is crucial to repeat the measurement at several frequencies and to renormalize the _ field _ line width by the effective gyromagnetic ratio @xmath28 .",
    "fmr spectroscopy is usually restricted to probe tiny deviations of the magnetization from its equilibrium .",
    "first , reaching large angles of precession requires a lot of microwave energy , especially in metallic samples and second , the interpretation of the high power regime requires a specific analysis since the equation of motion is non - linear @xcite .",
    "the typical angles of precession found in fmr are less than @xmath29 .",
    "although fmr is a sensitive technique , still the sensitivity of most conventional spectrometers is usually not sufficient to detect magnetization dynamics in individual sub - micron size samples .",
    "the crucial parameter here is the ratio between the volume of the sample and the volume of the detector : the so - called filling factor . with the recent development of mrfm",
    ", the sensitivity of magnetic resonance has been tremendously enhanced .",
    "nanometer scale sizes come now within reach as dan rugar and colleagues at ibm almaden recently showed with the detection of a single electron spin @xcite and with a record 90 nm resolution on nuclear paramagnets , where only a few thousands of nuclear spins contribute to the signal @xcite .",
    "the key to such performance comes from the size of the magnetic probe , which has a very strong coupling with the resonant volume , thus ensuring an almost optimized filling factor .    in this paper",
    ", we show how a mechanical - fmr setup can be used to perform fmr spectroscopy of sub - micron size samples .",
    "we present a thorough study of the sw eigen - modes in individual permalloy ( py ) disks , whose fmr spectra are compared to a 2d approximate analytical model and to full 3d micromagnetic simulations of the dynamical susceptibility .",
    "the structure of the rest of the paper is the following .",
    "section [ mrfm ] presents the principles of the mechanical - fmr and gives an extensive analysis of the spectral deformations induced by the magnetic probe on the measured fmr spectra . in section [ data ] , the experimental results are presented . in section",
    "[ models ] , we derive an approximate 2d analytical model and present the results of a 3d micromagnetic simulation . they are both used in section [ comparison ] to analyze the data . section [ conclusion ] contains a summary of the results obtained .",
    "the concept of mechanical detection of the magnetic resonance was first applied to fmr by phil wigen and chris hammel in 1996 @xcite .",
    "fig.[mechanical - fmr ] illustrates the mechanical - fmr setup , while fig.[photography ] presents its experimental realization for the present study .",
    "the sample magnetization is excited by a microstrip antenna placed underneath ( see figs.[mechanical - fmr ] and [ photography ] ) .",
    "the antenna consists of a @xmath30 m thick gold micro - strip patterned by optical lithography on top of a sapphire substrate whose bottom surface is a ground plane ( _ i.e. _ fully covered by au ) . in order to obtain a wide - band antenna , the top au electrode",
    "is shorted to the ground plane at the extremity of the substrate , hereby creating an anti - node of microwave magnetic field at the extremity . placing the sub - micron py disks at this location",
    "ensures a wide - band excitation scheme , at least until the magnetic field node , a quarter of the wavelength away , moves underneath the samples , which occurs at very high frequency ( above 20 ghz ) .",
    "the efficiency of this wide - band setup to induce large variation of the absorbed power , depends i ) on the amplitude @xmath12 of the excitation , ii ) on the volume of the sample , and iii ) on the susceptibility @xmath31 of the sample at resonance , inversely proportional to the line width .",
    "it is important to keep the amplitude of @xmath12 below saturation or other critical thresholds @xcite . indeed",
    ", significant spectral distortions are induced due to non - linear effects .",
    "these distortions being themselves a subject of research @xcite , all the data shown hereafter are taken in the linear regime , where the peak amplitude remains proportional to the excitation power",
    "_ i.e. _ precession angles limited to @xmath32 .",
    "the detection scheme is directly inspired from magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) .    ) and a cylindrical py disk ( diameter @xmath33 ) separated by a distance @xmath34 .",
    "the magnetic configurations in both objects are assumed to be saturated along @xmath35 .",
    "the color lines represent the iso-@xmath36 field lines .",
    "the bright and dark shades separate respectively the positive and negative coupling regions.,width=321 ]    a soft cantilever with a magnetic tip is placed in the stray field of the sample to be studied .",
    "the dipolar coupling between the tip and the sample ( see fig.[iso - bz ] ) creates a small flexion of the cantilever beam , which is detected optically by deflection of a laser beam on a 4-quadrants photodiode .",
    "the pitch angle is produced by the vertical component of the force @xmath37 ( see fig.[mechanical - fmr ] ) but also by the torque @xmath38 , the component perpendicular to the beam axis and to the vertical direction .",
    "in all the experiments below , we will measure with a spherical probe the magnetization dynamics of disk - shaped py samples perpendicularly magnetized by an homogeneous applied field .",
    "@xmath39 is larger than the saturation field of py , such that the magnetic state of the sample is almost uniform . in this situation",
    ", the coupling geometry preserves the axial symmetry , hence the mechanical coupling comes from the force @xmath37 only ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "there is a principal difference between the detected signal obtained by mechanical - fmr and by conventional - fmr .",
    "mechanical - fmr uses detectors which are only sensitive to @xmath41 , the static ( or longitudinal ) component of the magnetization , _",
    "i.e. _ to the susceptibility averaged on time scales which are much longer than any relaxation time in the spin system .",
    "the microwave oscillations of the transverse component do not couple to any mechanical mode of the cantilever , which typically oscillates in the audio range .",
    "when an fmr resonance is excited by the antenna , it is the deviation of @xmath41 from @xmath42 , @xmath43 , that diminishes the force @xmath37 on the cantilever ( see fig.[mechanical - fmr ] ) . in a corpuscular picture",
    ", each magnon reduces @xmath41 by @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the variation @xmath45 is proportional to the total number of magnons being excited by the microwave field inside the sample , independently of their coherence . another way to express",
    "this is through energy arguments . while conventional fmr measures the _ absorbed _ power ( see above ) , mechanical - fmr measures the _ stored _ energy @xcite .",
    "the ratio between these two quantities is actually @xmath46 , the relaxation rate of the out - of - equilibrium full magnons population towards the lattice . in other words",
    ", mechanical - fmr provides an intrinsic information about the dynamics of the sw system , where the area under each resonance peak of the @xmath45 spectrum is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "but the @xmath45 measurement is seldom obtained , because this quantity is a second order effect in the precession angle @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 is thus much smaller than the transverse susceptibility , which is of first order in @xmath48 .",
    "quite naturally , the scanning probe can be used here for imaging purpose .",
    "but the situation is different in paramagnetic @xcite and ferromagnetic spin systems . in a paramagnet ,",
    "the spins are decoupled and the excitation is localized in a `` resonant slice '' @xcite , whose thickness is inversely proportional to the field gradient produced by the magnetic tip .",
    "in contrast , neighboring spins in a ferromagnet are coupled through the exchange interaction , which works against localization effects .",
    "the stray field of the magnetic tip can , however , alter the sample magnetic configuration just underneath the tip , leading to tip - induced fmr resonances .",
    "the group of chris hammel has recently showed , that it is possible to produce these new localized fmr modes by approaching the magnetic tip close to the sample surface @xcite .",
    "exploitation of the spectral features of these new modes is still a challenge at the moment .",
    "detection wise , one benefits from the same advantage of an mfm .",
    "the spatial resolution is related to the size of the magnetic probe and the separation with the sample . in the present study , we are mostly interested by an optimization of the sensitivity of the mechanical detection , allowing us to measure smaller sample sizes . as will be shown below , optimization of the sensitivity requires to chose a size of the magnetic probe of the order of the size of the sample ( optimum filling factor @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , placing the probe far away from the sample surface and working in the weak coupling regime diminishes the spectral alteration produced by the tip .",
    "such conditions are quite obviously incompatible with good imaging conditions and an increase of the spatial resolution ( smaller probe ) must then come at the detriment of the sensitivity .",
    "one of the main advantage of the mechanical - fmr is its exquisite sensitivity .",
    "this is mainly due to the progress in nanofabrication technologies , which can produce micron - size mechanical structures with outstanding performance figures , _",
    "i.e. _ achieving among the best compromise between small size and large quality factor .      exciting the sample at a fixed frequency ( @xmath50 ) , spectroscopy is achieved by recording the cantilever motion as a function of the perpendicular dc applied field , @xmath22 , produced by an electromagnet . as mentioned before , the coupling between the mechanical oscillator and the microwave magnetization dynamics is purely static .",
    "however , it is possible and useful to modulate the microwave power at the mechanical resonance frequency of the first flexural mode of the cantilever @xmath51 khz in our case ) . as a result",
    ", the amplitude of vibration will be multiplied by @xmath52 , the quality factor of the mechanical resonator .",
    "note that the mechanical noise is also amplified .",
    "however , a sensitivity gain is obtained if this intrinsic mechanical noise exceeds the preamplifier noise or the noise of the microwave source .",
    "this modulation technique is referred to source or amplitude modulation .",
    "the amplitude of the microwave field follows the time dependence @xmath53 where the depth of the modulation is 100% .",
    "note that this modulation technique does not affect the line shape in the linear regime , because the period of modulation @xmath54 , is very large compared to the relaxation times @xmath47 and @xmath55 of the ferromagnetic system studied .",
    "we mention that the modulation of the microwave field at @xmath56 also induces a direct vibration of the cantilever , even outside any resonance phenomena of the probe or of the sample .",
    "we attribute this to a modulation of the temperature of the cantilever .",
    "the latter is a direct consequence of the modulation of the microwave heating and eddy currents , mainly induced by @xmath57 , the electric component of the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "this effect can distort the resonance peaks due to the modulation of the applied field on the sample by the vibrating magnetic probe .",
    "for instance , a sphere with a magnetic moment of @xmath58 emu vibrating by 10 nm@xmath59 induces a field modulation of about 6 oe@xmath59 on a sample placed at @xmath60 m from its center ( separation @xmath61 @xmath62 m , see below ) .",
    "this field modulation has no influence on the fmr signal if it is small compared to the line width , but will otherwise significantly broaden the resonance . to eliminate it ,",
    "a forced oscillation out of phase with the spurious contribution is produced by a piezo - electric bimorph slab placed nearby the cantilever .",
    "the resulting total vibration corresponds to a few nanometers at most .",
    "all the spectra shown below are obtained in these conditions , where the amplitude of vibration of the cantilever is compensated so that it has no influence on the measured fmr spectra .      in all mrfm setups ,",
    "the detection noise is only limited by the brownian motion of the cantilever , which behaves as an harmonic oscillator with a single degree of freedom .",
    "the theorem of equipartition of energy stipulates that , in the absence of external force , the vibration amplitude of the cantilever is such that the average kinetic energy associated to the thermal excitation is equal to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath65 is the temperature of the bath .",
    "thus the minimal detectable force follows the relation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the spring constant of the cantilever , @xmath52 its quality factor , and @xmath68 the detection bandwidth .",
    "femtonewton sensitive cantilevers are now readily available commercially .",
    "a biolever b from olympus with @xmath69 n / m has been used for this work . because the cantilever is very sensitive to thermal fluctuations , it is important to stabilize both the intensity of the laser ( to less than 15 ppm ) that is shined on top of the cantilever for the position sensing but also the over - all temperature of the microscope ( to less than 200 ppm ) , that is mounted on peltier elements . to increase the sensitivity ,",
    "the experiment is operated in a secondary vacuum of about @xmath70 torr .",
    "operating in vacuum is important to keep the large value of @xmath71 . as seen in eq.([fmin ] ) , the other parameters that control the minimum detectable force are the temperature and the bandwidth .",
    "working at low temperature and averaging the signal over large period of time allows the detection of attonewton forces@xcite .",
    "all the data shown hereafter are obtained at @xmath72 k and with a lock - in time constant of one second .      ) as a function of the ratio between their diameters , respectively @xmath73 and @xmath33 .",
    "the maximum force occurs when @xmath74.,width=321 ]    obviously the sensitivity directly depends on the strength of the dipolar coupling between the probe and the sample .",
    "as mentioned above , the magnetic probe must be carefully chosen , because there is an optimal size for a given sample ( concept of filling factor ) . in our case ,",
    "the probe itself is a magnetic sphere glued at the apex of the cantilever . for a spherical probe , the static force applied on the cantilever",
    "is simply proportional to @xmath75 , the @xmath35 component of the field gradient created by the sample at the center of the sphere : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the magnetic moment of the sphere . for a disk - shaped sample ,",
    "the largest force is obtained when the radius of the sphere is equal to the diameter of the disk @xcite , as shown in fig.[optimalpsi ] .",
    "the optimum corresponds to the particular case where the sphere captures all the positive field lines emanating from the disk ( see fig.[iso - bz ] ) .",
    "a scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) image of the sphere is shown in fig.[sphere ] .",
    "its diameter is @xmath78 m , which is slightly larger than the optimal size for our @xmath79 and @xmath80 m sample diameters .",
    "this sphere is an amorphous alloy whose main constituents are co ( 80 wt% ) , fe ( 10 wt% ) and si ( 9 wt% ) , as deduced from chemical analysis .",
    "its characteristics are measured after the gluing process of the sphere at the tip of the cantilever .",
    "the magnetization curve is obtained by placing the mounted cantilever above an fe cylinder ( diameter 2 mm , height 8 mm ) , which creates a well - characterized field gradient of @xmath81 g/@xmath62 m . by monitoring the deformation of the cantilever vs. the applied field , we can infer a 1.2 kg saturation field for the sphere .",
    "we also obtain the value of its magnetic moment @xmath82 emu , which is deduced from the known values of the field gradient and the cantilever s spring constant .",
    "we have already mentioned above the interest to preserve the axial symmetry , which is achieved if the center of the sphere is positioned above the center of the disk .",
    "two other comments should be added about the choice of the spherical shape for the magnetic probe .",
    "first , in contrast to cylinders , spheres do not have any shape anisotropy .",
    "this property , combined with the absence of magneto - crystalline anisotropy of the amorphous alloy , considerably decreases the influence of the applied magnetic field on the mechanical resonance frequency of the cantilever .",
    "this is important because the source modulation technique relies on a phase locked loop ( pll ) to keep the source modulation exactly at the resonance frequency of the cantilever .",
    "second , the magnetic probe on the cantilever is itself placed in the field gradient of the sample . as a result , mechanical vibrations of the cantilever are also produced by the excitation of the fmr modes of the probe itself .",
    "this can be seen as a reciprocal effect of the probe - sample coupling .",
    "using different shapes for the probe ( sphere ) and for the sample ( disk ) , the two fmr spectra are completely separated , mainly due to the difference in the shape anisotropies of the two different geometries . in the spectral range shown in this study ( @xmath83 to 10 ghz ) , the fmr resonance of the sphere occurs below 3 koe @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ at much lower field than for the disks studied hereafter .",
    "the optimization of the sensitivity discussed above has , however , a drawback . increasing",
    "the coupling between the probe and the sample inevitably produces a distortion of the spectral features .",
    "it is thus important to understand this effect and to keep it inside the perturbation regime so that one could still deduce the intrinsic behavior of the sample , _",
    "i.e. _ without the presence of the probe . in mechanical - fmr ,",
    "the spectral distortions are due to the stray field of the probe .",
    "it produces an additional field inhomogeneity in the internal effective magnetic field , which affects the detailed sw dispersion relation inside the sample and thus the resonance condition .",
    "the strength of the effect depends on @xmath77 and on the separation @xmath34 between the probe and the sample ( see figs.[mechanical - fmr ] and [ iso - bz ] ) .",
    "we discuss in the following how to ensure that the field inhomogeneity produced by the probe is small compared to the internal dipolar field variations along the radial direction of the sample ( @xmath84 for a non - ellipsoidal shape ) .",
    "thorough experimental studies have been performed in the past on mechanical - fmr of a y@xmath85fe@xmath86o@xmath87 single crystal disk for different separations @xmath34 between the magnetic tip and sample surface @xcite .",
    "it was found that , when the bias field inhomogeneity from the probe is smaller than a few percents of the internal field variation inside the sample , its main effect is to shift the entire spectrum to higher frequency as @xmath34 decreases .",
    "this shift is homogeneous within less than 10% for all the peaks corresponding to the different sw modes . in these conditions ,",
    "their spatial profiles are almost not affected by the presence of the probe , and the relative amplitudes between the peaks are kept to their intrinsic values . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bias field from the tip represents a large perturbation to the internal field inside the isolated sample , the spatial profiles of the sw modes are affected @xcite , and the observed fmr spectrum can not be recognized as intrinsic to the sample .",
    "this situation can also lead to a different coupling between the probe and the sample @xcite .",
    "however , it is to note that since the mechanical probe is independent from the excitation , an increase of the coupling between the sample and the probe do not produce any additional contribution to the fmr line width @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the radiation damping found when the coupling to the microwave resonator increases @xcite .",
    "a quantitative estimation of @xmath88 , the shift induced by the tip on each sw mode , can be obtained analytically within a 2d model . by 2d , we mean here a model where the precessional profile of each mode in the disk only depends on the two in - plane coordinates , _ i.e. _ on @xmath89 in a cylindrical frame ( it is uniform along the thickness direction @xmath35 ) . in that case , the resonance condition depends on the phase delay of the sw accumulated along the diameter .",
    "constructive interferences occur when the phase delay over a cycle is equal to @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to the wkb approximation applied to the dispersion relation of magnetostatic forward volume waves ( msfvw ) , established by damon and eshbach in 1961 @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will use the dipole - exchange dispersion relation developed by kalinikos and slavin @xcite for magnetized thin films and later applied by kakazei _",
    "et al . _ for the case of disks magnetized in the exact perpendicular geometry @xcite .",
    "we start with the normal modes basis of a disk magnetized in the perpendicular direction , which are the @xmath92 , where @xmath93s are the bessel functions of the first kind and @xmath94 is the modulus of the in - plane sw wave vector determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "we shall assume that the modes satisfy the dipolar pinning condition at the circumference of the disk samples , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath95 .",
    "thus @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the @xmath98 root of @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the radius of the disk . in this notation ,",

    "fig.[eigen - modes ] is a color - coded representation of the transverse susceptibility @xmath31 corresponding to the first modes .    , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 indicate respectively the number of nodes in the circumferential and radial direction .",
    "only the modes @xmath103 couple to a uniform microwave excitation.,width=321 ]    the obtention of an analytical formula for the resonance condition shall be detailed in section [ analmod ] for the general case where the applied magnetic field makes a small angle @xmath104 with the normal of the disk ( see eqs.([tyb - arb - theta-1 ] ) and ( [ tyb - arb - theta-2 ] ) ) . for the estimation of the spectral deformations induced by the probe , we are only interested by the @xmath105 limit of the linearization of the equation of motion . the resonance condition for the normal mode @xmath106 in the perpendicular direction is given by the expression @xcite : @xmath107 here , @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the mode dependent effective internal magnetic field @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the total external magnetic field , @xmath112 is the longitudinal matrix element of the effective demagnetizing tensor ( see eq.([n - dyn ] ) ) and @xmath113 is the perpendicular uniaxial anisotropy field ( of spin - orbit coupling origin ) .",
    "@xmath114 is the exchange length , which depends on the exchange stiffness constant @xmath115 , expressed in erg / cm ( @xmath116 in py ) .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath117 is derived in section [ analmod ] , eq.([g - perp ] ) .    in our notation",
    ", @xmath118 is the demagnetizing tensor of the disk .",
    "appendix [ appa ] gives the analytical expression for the different matrix elements of this tensor in the cylindrical coordinates . in eq.([hi ] ) , the demagnetizing field along @xmath35 depends on a matrix element of the effective demagnetization tensor @xmath119 .",
    "the latter is the demagnetizing tensor weighted by the spatial dependence of the normal mode profile @xmath120 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a renormalization constant : @xmath123    to calculate the influence of the sphere on the resonance field of the mode @xmath106 , we need to expand the external field as the sum of two contributions : the homogeneous magnetic field @xmath124 produced by the electromagnet and the inhomogeneous stray field of the sphere @xmath125 : @xmath126 here we are only interested by its @xmath35-component , @xmath127 .",
    "then , the influence of the probe simply yields a modification of the internal magnetic field @xmath128 of eq.([hi ] ) by @xmath129 where the shift @xmath88 induced by the probe is averaged along the radial direction by the mode profile : @xmath130 this expression allows us to give an estimation of the maximum coupling allowed to keep the spectral deformations in the perturbation regime .",
    "the additional contribution @xmath88 must be small compared to the internal field variation inside the sample volume ( @xmath131 ) in order to keep the normal mode basis unchanged . in the opposite case",
    ", the sw mode profiles and their resonance fields must be directly calculated from the msfvw dispersion relation and from the magnetostatic potential .",
    "clear experimental signatures of this strong influence of the probe on the sw mode can be found @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath42 and @xmath135 used in the calculation are those derived below from cavity - fmr studies of the extended thin film .",
    "we also use the physical characteristics of the probe derived from the sem images in fig.[sphere ] and magnetometry .",

    "the value of @xmath104 found here is in disagreement with the previous finding , which is somewhat surprising since the two disks are located nearby , on the same substrate .",
    "several arguments suggest that the true value of @xmath104 is the value for the largest disk , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath266 . as shown in fig.[simu-5d ] , the analytical model tends to underestimate the effect of the angle as the disk shrinks in diameter , compared to the 3d simulation .",
    "this affects the shift in the resonance field and the lowering of @xmath250 , both underestimated by the 2d approximate model .",
    "a fit with this model will thus yield to a larger @xmath104 value than the 3d simulation .",
    "if we now compare the experimental results of fig.[figdisk2 ] with the 3d simulation at @xmath235 of fig.[simu-5d ] , we find that @xmath267 koe , which is a shift larger than the one expected , @xmath268 oe from @xmath269 m ( see section [ shift ] ) .",
    "we emphasize here that the uncertainties mentioned above in the properties of the sample and the probe could translate in substantial errors in the 2d and 3d analytical models .",
    "in fact , finite size effects in the @xmath80 m crucially depend on the exact properties of the sample . moreover , due to the small separation between the probe and the sample , the effect of the radial stray field from the probe is also more important than for the largest disk .",
    "m at 5.6 ghz.,width=321 ]    the amplitude of the modes indicates their coupling with the spectrometer . in the following we attempt to predict the relative amplitudes between the peaks .",
    "we will concentrate on the 5.6 ghz spectrum measured for the largest disk ( cf .",
    "fig.[figdisk1 ] ) .",
    "since the mechanical - fmr is using different schemes for the excitation and detection part , they need to be treated separately .",
    "we first compute the coupling to the excitation , which is identical to all fmr spectrometers .",
    "the microwave field being uniform at the scale of the sample , the coupling is simply given by the overlap integral with the transverse susceptibility . in our notation , we find that the angle of precession is given by @xmath270 where we only consider the coupling to the @xmath221 modes and where @xmath271 is the damping coefficient .    in our case ,",
    "the force induced on the cantilever is given by @xmath272 where the integral is the gradient of field along the @xmath35 direction induced by the local variation of longitudinal component of magnetization inside the sample : @xmath273 and where @xmath274 in eq.[force ] , we have used the fact that our probe has a spherical shape and can be viewed as a magnetic dipole @xmath275 placed at its center .",
    "we have reported in fig.[figamp ] a comparison between the measured spectra and the calculated peak shape using the analytical model and assuming that the line width is identical for all the modes .",
    "we find that the agreement with the data is excellent .",
    "in particular , we observe that the peak amplitude decreases by almost an order of magnitude between the @xmath261 and @xmath262 modes .",
    "this decrease is less pronounced in conventional fmr which measures the transverse component of the magnetization ( see fig.[simu-0d ] ) .",
    "this implies some caution when comparing the relative amplitude of the peaks found in the 3d simulation of the transverse susceptibility with the one found in the mechanical - fmr experiment .",
    "m disk ( full circles ) and the @xmath80 m disk ( open boxes ) . the red triangle indicates the value measured by cavity - fmr on the extended film on si .",
    "the mechanical - fmr data are renormalized by @xmath250 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to a damping coefficient @xmath276.,width=321 ]    another important characterization concerns the width @xmath277 of the resonance line .",
    "the full circles and open boxes in fig.[figwidth ] are the line widths measured as a function of frequency in the py disks of diameters @xmath164 m and @xmath80 m , respectively .",
    "all values have been renormalized by the effective gyromagnetic ratio @xmath278 .",
    "these line widths are among the smallest reported for py , confirming the excellent quality of the material used for this study .",
    "the resonance line width ( half - width at mid - height of the absorption curve ) of the py polycrystalline magnetic layer is described @xcite as the sum of two contributions : @xmath279 the first term relates to the intrinsic relaxation rate of the magnetization vector whereas the second term corresponds to the inhomogeneous broadening induced by a distribution of internal field , as well as by a distribution of polarization angles , of characteristics widths @xmath280 and @xmath281 , respectively .",
    "@xmath280 reflects the spatial inhomogeneity of the field parameter @xmath282 whereas @xmath281 refers to the distribution of the orientation @xmath104 of the applied field with respect to the normal to the surface of the individual crystallites .",
    "the results obtained on the disks should be compared to the value observed by cavity - fmr on the extended thin film . in the cavity - fmr studies ,",
    "the line widths measured on the film grown on the atomically flat si substrate in the parallel and in the perpendicular geometries are equal ( 25 oe ) and reflect almost entirely the homogeneous contribution . the measured value is represented by a red triangle in fig.[figwidth ] .",
    "it allows for an estimate of the intrinsic damping parameter ( @xmath283 ) , found to be @xmath284 .",
    "this value is an upper bound for @xmath271 , since the presence of a small inhomogeneous contribution in the line width would reduce the value of the homogeneous part .",
    "the film grown on mica presents more inhomogeneities than on si , the results of which corresponds to a line width increase of 3 oe .",
    "this is due to the even surface of the mica substrate , which bends over because of the strain between the different sheets of mica .    from the frequency dependence of the line width of the large disk , we can estimate the damping coefficient in the nanostructure , found to be @xmath229 ( dashed line on fig.[figwidth ] ) , in good agreement with the upper bound found on the thin film .",
    "we find that there is no inhomogeneous broadening in the nanostructure , which means that the small amount observed in the extended film deposited on mica is not relevant in structures confined at the sub - micron length scale @xcite .",
    "it also implies that there is no additional broadening induced by the mechanical - fmr . finally , the frequency dependence of the line width at low frequencies and of the small disk is not linear .",
    "in fact , the magnetization configuration becomes not uniform at low applied field , and the renormalization of the field line widths by @xmath250 is not sufficient to recover the intrinsic behavior .",
    "moreover it was shown on the extended thin film that as the applied field is decreased , the increase of the angle between the equilibrium magnetization and the normal of the film increases the line width , through the inhomogeneous contribution associated @xcite to the distribution @xmath281 in eq.[deltah ] .",
    "it was shown in this article how mrfm can be used to detect and _ quantitatively _ analyze the intrinsic fmr spectra of _ individual _ sub - micron size samples .",
    "to realize this objective , the coupling between the magnetic probe attached to the cantilever and the sample has to be optimized .",
    "on one hand , it has to be as strong as possible to detect fmr in tiny samples . on the other hand",
    ", the inhomogeneity induced by the stray field of the probe has to be small compared to the internal dipolar field inhomogeneity in the sample , in order to detect the intrinsic behavior of the latter . using a magnetic sphere",
    "whose size is of the order of the disk - shaped samples enables to meet these two requirements .",
    "we demonstrate a 1000 spins sensitivity at room temperature . using two approximate 2d and 3d models",
    ", we can understand the measured fmr - spectra on py disks patterned out from the same extended film , whose characteristics are well known .",
    "it requires a good understanding of finite size effects and of the homogeneous shift of the the sw modes resonance fields induced by the probe .",
    "finally , we would like to summarize the main advantages of mechanical - fmr : i ) its sensitivity to detect a single magnon excitation in a buried hybrid structure , _",
    "e.g. _ below contact electrodes , ii ) its versatility as a near field technique ( _ i.e. _ only sensitive to the area directly underneath the probe ) , which allows spatial imaging of the magnetization dynamics , and iii ) its ability to measure the longitudinal component of the magnetization , a quantity directly linked to the damping .",
    "we are greatly indebted to o. acher and a .-",
    "adenot for their help and support .",
    "this research was partially supported by the anr pnano06 - 0235 and by the european grant nmp - fp7 212257 - 2 master .",
    "the analytical formula that have been used for the demagnetization tensor , @xmath118 , of a disk of radius @xmath100 and thickness @xmath189 are explicitly written in this appendix .",
    "the formula are actually derived from the published work of s. tandon @xcite but we have chosen to reprint them below because a couple of small typos remain in the original paper .",
    "the only assumption made here is that the magnetization is homogeneous inside the cylindrical volume .    because of the axial symmetry",
    ", the values of the tensor @xmath118 are better expressed in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath285 and , using the notation of ref.@xcite , we introduce the reduced units @xmath286 :    @xmath287    where the notations @xmath288 and @xmath289 are respectively the distance ( in reduced units ) with the bottom and top surface of the cylinder . the function @xmath34 and @xmath290 design respectively the sign and heavisde functions : @xmath291    the integrals @xmath292 have the following expressions :    @xmath293    [ integ ]    where    @xmath294    @xmath295 and @xmath296 are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind and @xmath297 is the heuman s lambda function .    the above expressions are valid everywhere in space .",
    "the magnetic field induction at every point in space ( inside or outside the sample s volume ) simply obeys the formula : @xmath298 where @xmath299 is a function equals to 1 inside the cylindrical volume and 0 otherwise : @xmath300",
    "the notations have been defined in fig.[fig - zeta ] : @xmath301 is the cartesian frame along the principal axis of the disk , with @xmath35 oriented along the normal and @xmath302 the cartesian frame of the magnetization dynamics , with @xmath303 along the equilibrium ( or effective magnetic field ) direction .",
    "both frames are related by a rotation of an angle @xmath304 around the @xmath305 direction .",
    "if @xmath104 is the angle that the external magnetic field makes with the normal of the disk , then @xmath304 is implicitly defined by the equilibrium condition : @xmath306    in all the expressions above , the tensors are expressed in the cartesian frame of the disk @xmath301 .",
    "this applies for the demagnetizing factors @xmath118 in appendix [ appa ] , but also for the matrices : @xmath307 @xmath308    solving eq.([eq - mu ] ) requires to write down the different tensors @xmath309 in the local frame of the magnetization .",
    "this is achieved through the transformation @xmath310 , where @xmath311 is the rotation matrix between the @xmath301 and @xmath302 : @xmath312 and the subscript @xmath189 stands for the transpose ."
