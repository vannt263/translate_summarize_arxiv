    "a finite collection of elements @xmath7 in a separable topological group @xmath8 is called a ( finite ) _ topological generating set _ for @xmath8 if the countable group @xmath9 which they generate is dense in @xmath8 . in this case",
    "we say @xmath8 is _ topologically @xmath10-generated_. in 1990 , hofmann and morris @xcite showed that every separable compact connected group is topologically @xmath11-generated .",
    "their result built upon earlier work of kuranishi @xcite for compact semisimple lie groups .",
    "very recently , gelander and le maitre @xcite have applied the solution to hilbert s fifth problem to give a very general result : every separable connected locally compact group is topologically finitely generated .",
    "the homeomorphism and diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds are far from locally compact , and so different tools are needed for their study .",
    "we are partially motivated in this paper by a desire to study these groups , loosely , as infinite - dimensional analogues of lie groups .",
    "in particular we seek to understand their discrete and dense finitely generated subgroups .",
    "the reader may consult the paper @xcite of the first named author for a large number of remarks and open questions in this program .",
    "it is very well - known that the group @xmath3 of orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the interval @xmath12 $ ] is topologically @xmath11-generated .",
    "the most popular example of a @xmath11-generated dense subgroup in @xmath3 is thompson s group @xmath13 , represented as a group of piecewise linear homeomorphisms .",
    "it is also well - known that the usual embedding of @xmath13 may be `` smoothed out '' to find representations of @xmath13 which lie in @xmath14 , for all @xmath15 @xcite",
    ". however , these representations of @xmath13 are never dense in @xmath14 with respect to the appropriate @xmath16 topology .",
    "in fact , no finitely generated group has been shown to admit a @xmath2-dense representation in @xmath17 .",
    "given that many separable topological groups do not admit finitely generated dense subgroups at all ( this is easy to see in the additive product group @xmath18 for instance ) , we are motivated by the question : is @xmath0 topologically finitely generated or not ?",
    "this question is especially intriguing since the topological group @xmath0 is homeomorphic to an infinite dimensional separable banach space .",
    "establishes a homeomorphism from @xmath0 to the banach space @xmath19 $ ] . ]",
    "the first main result of our paper is to show that , despite a lack of simple examples , dense finitely generated subgroups of @xmath0 do exist .",
    "[ thm : main ] there exists a finitely generated dense subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "the core of the proof lies in constructing a set of seven topological generators @xmath20 for the commutator subgroup @xmath8 of @xmath17 .",
    "stated informally , we use four generators @xmath21 to encode small copies of a countable dense subset @xmath22 of @xmath8 along a sequence of disjoint subintervals @xmath23 of @xmath24 .",
    "the fifth generator @xmath25 is used to `` erase '' finitely many excess copies when they are not needed , while the sixth and seventh generators @xmath26 and @xmath27 are used to magnify the small copies to approximate the maps @xmath28 to arbitrary precision .",
    "our construction relies on the perfectness results of tsuboi @xcite for diffeomorphism groups of the interval , as well as the following original lemma on approximation by diffeomorphisms with iterative @xmath10-th roots which is independently interesting .",
    "[ lem : introroot ] let @xmath29 without a fixed point in ( 0,1 ) and assume that @xmath30 . then for every @xmath31 , there exists a @xmath32 and a positive integer @xmath33 such that @xmath34 is @xmath35-close to identity and @xmath36 is @xmath35-close to @xmath37 , in the @xmath2 metric .",
    "since @xmath0 admits a quotient group topologically isomorphic to @xmath38 , it is not too hard to see that a dense subgroup of @xmath39 requires at least @xmath40 generators .",
    "our construction uses @xmath41 generators , and while this number should be easy to reduce , we are not sure of the least number of generators necessary .",
    "the least number of topological generators for a topological group @xmath8 is sometimes called the _ topological rank _ of @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .    what is the topological rank of @xmath0 ?",
    "of @xmath39 for @xmath42 ?",
    "the next corollary is immediate from our main theorem , using a standard fragmentation argument .",
    "there exists a finitely generated dense subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "write @xmath43)\\cdot{\\mathop{\\rm diff}}_+^1([c , d])$ ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are subarcs of the circle whose union is the entire circle .",
    "@xmath46)$ ] and @xmath47)$ ] are both topologically isomorphic to @xmath0 , so they have finite topological generating sets @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively by theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "then @xmath50 is a finite topological generating set for @xmath1 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors discuss the concept of _ local rank_. the local rank of a separable topological group is the minimal number @xmath10 such that , within any neighborhood of identity , there exists a set of @xmath10 many topological generators for the group .",
    "if no such @xmath10 exists , the local rank of the group is said to be infinite .",
    "examination of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] reveals that the generators we construct may be chosen arbitrarily close to identity in the @xmath2 metric , so the local rank of @xmath0 is at most @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 and @xmath1 have finite local rank .",
    "in the second part of this paper , we are concerned with the question of the generic behavior of finite topological generating sets .",
    "the question dates back to schreier and ulam ( @xcite ) , who showed that for every compact connected metrizable group @xmath8 , the set of pairs @xmath51 which generate a dense subgroup of @xmath8 has full haar measure in @xmath52 .",
    "more recently , winkelmann @xcite has proved the following striking result in the case of connected lie groups @xmath8 : if @xmath8 is amenable then there exists an @xmath33 such that the set of @xmath10-tuples @xmath53 which generate a dense subgroup has zero haar measure for all @xmath54 , while the set of @xmath10-tuples @xmath53 which generate a discrete subgroup has zero haar measure for all @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath8 is non - amenable , then the set of discrete finitely generated groups and the set of non - discrete finitely generated groups both have infinite measure , for every @xmath56 .",
    "in this paper we are primarily concerned with groups which are not locally compact and thus do not carry haar measures . as the natural alternative , we approach the question in terms of baire category . recall that each group of the form @xmath57 or @xmath58 for a compact manifold @xmath4 is a polish ( i.e. separable completely metrizable ) topological group and",
    "thus satisfies the hypothesis of the baire category theorem ( here , @xmath57 denotes the connected component of identity in the full homeomorphism group @xmath59 ; similarly , @xmath58 denotes the connected component of identity in the full diffeomorphism group @xmath60 ) .",
    "we will say that a polish topological group @xmath8 is _ generically topologically @xmath10-generated _ if the set +    @xmath61 is dense in @xmath62    is comeager in @xmath63 ( i.e. if @xmath64 contains a countable intersection of dense open subsets of @xmath63 ) .",
    "if a group is generically topologically @xmath10-generated , then by the kuratowski - ulam theorem , it is generically topologically @xmath65-generated for all @xmath66 .    as an example , each torus @xmath67 is topologically @xmath68-generated , so @xmath69 is non - empty .",
    "this is a consequence of a classical theorem of leopold kronecker ( @xcite ) , which asserts that @xmath69 of @xmath70 consists exactly of those tuples @xmath71 for which @xmath72 is a linearly independent set over the rationals . but this characterization implies something stronger , that @xmath69 is in fact comeager in @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , one may apply kronecker s theorem to show not only that each additive group @xmath73 is @xmath74-generated , but moreover that @xmath75 is comeager in @xmath73 .",
    "by contrast , kechris and rosendal ( @xcite ) showed that the infinite permutation group @xmath76 , endowed with its usual topology , is topologically @xmath11-generated , but since @xmath76 is a totally disconnected group , @xmath64 can not be dense in @xmath76 , let alone comeager .",
    "rather , by direct argument it is easy to see that @xmath64 is nowhere dense in @xmath76 for all @xmath10 .    our main result on this topic is the following .",
    "[ thm : generic ] @xmath3 is generically topologically @xmath11-generated .",
    "it is striking that finitely generated dense subgroups are ubiquitous at the @xmath77 level in @xmath3 , and yet , speaking empirically , to find even one @xmath2-dense finitely generated subgroup in @xmath0 presents a great challenge .",
    "we remark that @xmath3 , despite being non - locally compact , is in some ways analogous to a compact connected topological group , in the sense that it always has finite diameter with respect to any left - invariant metric on the group , and thus has bounded large scale metric geometry .",
    "the diffeomorphism group @xmath0 , by contrast , has a very complicated and certainly unbounded large scale geometry .",
    "this fact may be reflected in the seeming paucity of finitely generated dense subgroups there .    in this paper",
    "we also point out that @xmath24 is the unique compact connected manifold with boundary in which generic finitely generated groups of homeomorphisms are dense . to state this more precisely ,",
    "suppose @xmath4 is a compact manifold with boundary , and denote by @xmath5 the connected component of the identity in the group of homeomorphisms of @xmath4 which fix every point of the boundary @xmath78 .",
    "note that if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 , and @xmath5 is generically topologically @xmath11-generated by our results .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath81 , we have the following .",
    "let @xmath4 be a compact connected manifold with boundary which is not homeomorphic to a closed interval .",
    "then the set @xmath64 of all @xmath10-tuples which topologically generate @xmath5 is contained in a closed nowhere dense subset of @xmath82 for all positive integers @xmath10 .",
    "this theorem is shown using a standard ping - pong argument , which allows one to find open neighborhoods in a group whose elements always generate free discrete subgroups .",
    "the same argument shows that @xmath83 is not generically @xmath10-generated for any @xmath10 , nor is @xmath57 for any compact manifold @xmath4 without boundary .",
    "this argument does not apply on the interval , which stands alone among the compact connected manifolds in this regard .",
    "we begin by showing that the topological commutator subgroup of @xmath17 is finitely generated .",
