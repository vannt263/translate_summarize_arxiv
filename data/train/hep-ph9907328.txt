    " we found that if @xmath2-decay and @xmath2-capture were described by a four - fermion interaction similar to @xmath3-decay , all their coupling constants appeared to be of the same magnitude .",
    "this began the universal fermi interaction .",
    "we then went on to speculate that , in analogy with electromagnetic forces , the basic weak interaction could be carried by a universal coupling through an intermediate heavy boson , which i later called @xmath4 for weak .",
    "naturally we went to our teacher , enrico fermi , and told him of our discoveries .",
    "fermi was extremely encouraging . with his usual deep insight",
    ", he immediately recognized the further implications beyond our results .",
    "he put forward the problem that if this is to be the universal interaction , then there must be reasons why some pairs of fermions should have such interactions , and some pairs should not . for example , why does @xmath5 and @xmath6 a few days later , he told us that he had found the answer ; he then proceeded to assign various sets of numbers , + 1 , -1 , and 0 , to each of these particles .",
    "this was the first time to my knowledge that both the laws of baryon - number conservation and of lepton - number conservation were formulated together to give selection rules .",
    "however , at that time ( 1948 ) , my own reaction to such a scheme was to be quite unimpressed : surely , i thought , it is not necessary to explain why @xmath7 , since everyone knows that the identity of a particle is never changed through the emission and absorption of a photon ; as for the weak interaction , why should one bother to introduce a long list of mysterious numbers , when all one needs is to say that only three combinations @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 can have interactions with the intermediate boson .",
    "[ little did i expect that soon there would be many other pairs joining these three . ]",
    "most discoveries in physics are made because the time is ripe .",
    "if one person does not make it , then surely another person will do it at about the same time . in looking back ,",
    "what we did in establishing the universal fermi interaction was a discovery of exactly this nature .",
    "this is clear , since the same universal fermi coupling observations were made independently by at least three other groups , klein , puppi , and tiomno and wheeler , all at about the same time . yet",
    "fermis s thinking was of a more profound nature .",
    "unfortunately for physics , his proposal was never published .",
    "the full significance of these conservation laws was not realized until years later .",
    "while this might be the first time that i failed to recognize a great idea in physics when it was presented to me , unfortunately it did not turn out to be the last . ",
    "first published proposals about lepton number conservation are dated back to 1953 @xcite . but only after a decade of intensive experimental research @xcite , the lepton number conservation gained the status of firmly established law of nature . at present , experiment provides one the most stringent bounds on violation of this conservation law @xcite .",
    "in fact the present experimental data indicates that each of three lepton generations has his own conserved lepton ( flavor ) number : in all processes , investigated until recently , electron number @xmath11 , muon number @xmath12 and tau number @xmath13 are separately conserved .",
    "this is in a sharp contrast with hadron sector , there only the global baryon number is conserved and individual quark flavors are mixed through their couplings to the electroweak higs field . in the standard model this situation is simply postulated by assuming that there are no right - chirality neutrinos and therefore neutrinos are massless .",
    "this is no more true in various extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "but if neutrinos are massive , the same kind of flavor mixing is expected in lepton sector , as is observed for quarks .",
    "it is amusing that lepton flavor violation of this type ( neutrino oscillations ) were predicted @xcite before any notion of quarks ever emerged in physics , but it took four decades to get at last strong experimental indications @xcite that this phenomenon actually takes place . yet ,",
    "if the super - kamiokande result is really due to @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) oscillations , there is some mystery why neutrino masses are so miserably small .",
    "the mystery which maybe lead to the mirror world @xcite .",
    "neutrino mixing , if present , can trigger other lepton flavor violating processes .",
    "search for such kind of decays began half a century ago @xcite , before lepton flavor was even invented !",
    "no positive signal was ever seen , however .",
    "very small neutrino masses explain this negative result : flavor changing transitions generated by neutrino mixing turned out to be proportional to @xmath16 due to lepton analog of gim mechanism , and so are extremely suppressed 4 . however , neutrino mixing is not the only possibility to have lepton flavor changing transitions , and many extensions of the standard model exist @xcite which allow such transitions with much bigger expected rate .",
    "the tremendous success of the standard model initiated a wide spread of the philosophy that the only respectable symmetries are gauge symmetries .",
    "lepton number symmetries are global @xmath17 symmetries which is deadly wrong in light of this philosophy : any attempt to make them local will lead to the immediate conflict with the fact that the corresponding leptonic photons and mediated by them long range interactions were never observed .",
    "but global symmetries , whatever their origin would be , is commonly believed to be violated by quantum gravity .",
    "the reasoning is simple @xcite .",
    "global charges , like lepton flavor , can be eaten by black holes , which subsequently may evaporate .",
    "therefore nonperturbative quantum gravity effects with formation and evaporation of `` virtual black holes '' can trigger global symmetry violation . the same kind of effect can occur if wormholes exist which may take global charges from our universe to some other one @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the violation of global symmetries due to wormhole effects could be suppressed by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the wormhole action which may eat the global charge @xcite .    on the contrary , local symmetries ,",
    "it is believed , can not be violated by quantum gravity .",
    "the reason is not that black holes can not eat local charges like electric one .",
    "certainly they do eat them with the same appetite as the global ones .",
    "but since the local charge is given by a surface integral at spatial infinity , because of the gauss law , its conservation can not be affected by localized process in space - time , as is the black - hole evaporation @xcite .",
    "this means that the black holes fattened by local charge will eventually form charged extreme black holes which do not evaporate any further @xcite .    but lepton flavor symmetries are not local symmetries .",
    "so they are expected to be violated at list on quantum gravity scale @xmath20 .",
    "what this means for low energy physics at electroweak scale ?",
    "usually it is assumed that effective lepton flavor violating unrenormalizable vertexes will be generated in the low energy effective lagrangian , which are scaled by inverse powers of @xmath21 . in spite of a huge difference between electroweak and the planck scales",
    ", such high dimensional operators can lead to the observable low energy effects @xcite .",
    "recently a very bold idea was pushed forward @xcite that actually quantum gravity scale may be as low as tev , if some extra spatial dimensions are compactified at scales large compared to the electroweak scale .",
    "if @xmath22 stands for the compactification radius of these large extra dimensions and @xmath23  for the quantum gravity scale in the underlying high dimensional theory , the following relation was obtained in @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of extra large dimensions .",
    "assuming @xmath26 , this relation implies @xmath27 already @xmath28 leads to @xmath29  just the distance beneath which gravitational interactions have not been yet tested experimentally .",
    "it is further assumed that usual standard model fields do not directly feel these extra dimensions , because they are stuck on a wall ( `` 3-brane '' ) in the higher ( @xmath30 ) dimensional space - time .",
    "although crazy at first sight , this idea seems not to be in conflict with the present experimental data , and , on the contrary , provides interesting phenomenological implications , as was revealed by ever increasing number of investigations [ 15@xmath3133 ] .",
    "moreover , the picture of ordinary particles confined on the brane , because they correspond to endpoints of open strings attached to the brane , while gravity , represented by closed strings , propagating in the bulk , was realized in the framework of several string models @xcite .",
    "note however , that it has recently been pointed out @xcite that quantum gravity effects can lead to an effective energy - dependent light velocity in vacuum , some kind of `` intrinsic birefringence '' of quantum space - time .",
    "it was further indicated that @xmath32-ray bursts , which have short duration , high energies and cosmological origin , can be used to test this prediction .",
    "recent analysis @xcite of tev @xmath32-ray flare from active galaxy markarian 421 can be interpreted @xcite as lower bound on quantum gravity energy scale @xmath33 .",
    "but it is too premature to conclude that this experimental result excludes low scale quantum gravity scenario advocated in @xcite . clearly",
    "a detailed study of quantum gravity birefringence in the framework of large extra dimensions model is , however , desirable .",
    "nevertheless , if this fascinating @xmath34 scale quantum gravity scheme has something to do with reality , flavor violating effective operators are expected at energies much less than @xmath23 .",
    "because experiment indicates severe restrictions on such operators , this can be quite an ordeal for the new theory .",
    "this question was addressed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that the `` democratic '' maximal mixing between all three families is excluded and only two of them can have significant mixing .",
    "usually , the present experimental data is more restrictive for lepton flavor mixing between the first and second generations .",
    "data involving the third generation are scarce .",
    "this leaves more room for imagination . in this note",
    "we assume that significant lepton flavor mixing between the third and second families is generated by low scale quantum gravity ( or by some other , yet unknown , physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the super - kamiokande data @xcite can be a hint towards such phenomenon ) and consider the phenomenological implications of the corresponding effective 4-fermion operators .",
    "our primary interest will be such lepton flavor violating decays as @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "these decays escaped much attention , on the contrary to the lepton flavor violating decays involving the first and second generation leptons @xcite .",
    "as our aim is to estimate how significant quantum gravity induced lepton - flavor violation could be in lucky circumstances , we do not consider all possible lepton - flavor violating 4-fermion operators .",
    "which of them ( if any ) actually survive in the low energy effective action depends on family - symmetry structure of the underlying theory @xcite and can not be unambiguously guessed from the present experimental data .    instead",
    ", we will focus on some specific 4-fermion operators , which are not excluded at present , and which can lead , as we will see , to sizeable lepton - flavor violation effects .",
    "suppose the following dimension-6 operators are somehow generated @xmath37 & \\\\ & \\delta{\\cal l_v}=\\frac{4\\pi\\alpha_{v}}{\\lambda^2 } \\left [ ( \\bar \\tau_r \\gamma_\\mu\\tau_r)(\\bar \\tau_r\\gamma^\\mu \\mu_r)+ ( \\bar \\tau_l \\gamma_\\mu\\tau_l)(\\bar \\tau_l\\gamma^\\mu \\mu_l)\\right ] &   \\ ; , \\nonumber \\label{eq3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the new physics scale ( quantum gravity ? ) , which generates lepton - flavor violation .",

    "@xmath76 @xmath77 now r is not small and we should use the full loop - integral function @xmath78 but this does nt help much , anyway  the above given ratio is not likely to exceed @xmath79 .",
    "the above considered lepton - flavor changing decays have small rates partly because they are caused by one - loop effects",
    ". we can avoid loop suppression factor @xmath81 in the decay amplitude if manage to find such 4-fermion operators which allow lepton - flavor violating decays at tree level .",
    "is this possible ?",
    "the answer is yes .",

    "one more benefit from such operators is that the @xmath83 ( electromagnetic ) suppression is also overcome in the @xmath64 amplitude .",

    "nonrelativistic approximation looks , however , reasonable for heavy enough @xmath85 and @xmath86 quarks .",
    "so simplification can be achieved by using the fact that in the weak binding limit the state vector of the @xmath87 vector meson can be represented as a superposition of the free quark - antiquark states @xcite : @xmath88 @xmath89 \\bar q[\\frac{m_q}{m_v}\\vec p-\\vec p,\\bar s ] >   .\\ ] ] we use @xmath90 normalization for the meson state vectors while @xmath91 one for the state vectors of quark ( or antiquark ) with mass m. @xmath92 and @xmath93 are three independent polarization 4-vectors for the vector mesons",

    "note that our normalization convention indicates the following anticommutation relations @xmath101 now all what is needed is to decompose quark field operators in the interaction lagrangian @xmath102 in terms of creation and annihilation operators and use the above given anticommutation relations while calculating lepton - flavor changing neutral current matrix element , along with the nonrelativistic approximation @xmath103 . as a result ,",

    "analogous consideration holds for the @xmath66-meson decay .",
    "both cases can be unified by the formula @xmath112 assuming once more strong coupling @xmath113 and @xmath114 , this formula predicts big enough branching ratios : @xmath115 having in mind near future high luminosity meson factories , such rates are clearly observable , are nt they ?",
    "note that ( 7 ) interactions will contribute also into @xmath116 decay .",
    "so the branching ratio for this decay may be even somewhat higher , than given above , if all contributions interfere constructively .",
    "it is a pity that the small mass of @xmath118 meson makes it less sensitive to lepton - flavor violation originated from a new physics at higher scales , because this very smallness of its mass prevents it from decaying into @xmath119 , so considerably reducing background . anyhow",
    "this peculiarity of @xmath117 decay may be of practical interest . in this section",
    "we take a closer look to a possible signature of this decay mode .",
    "let us examine secondary muon spectrum from the final state @xmath41 decay ( because of short lifetime , this final state @xmath41 is not directly detectable )",
    ". in the @xmath41-lepton rest frame @xmath2-spectrum is @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 being the muon energy in this frame .    in the laboratory frame ( @xmath118-meson rest frame )",
    "the muon energy @xmath123 is given by lorentz transformation @xmath124 where latexmath:[\\[\\cos{\\theta^*}=\\frac{\\vec{p^*_\\mu}\\cdot \\vec{p_\\tau}}{|\\vec{p^*_\\mu}|    @xmath41-lepton energy in the @xmath117 decay is @xmath126 , where @xmath127 .",
    "so @xmath128 therefore ( 11 ) can be rewritten as @xmath129 or , introducing the muon energy fraction @xmath130 in the laboratory frame , @xmath131 \\ ; . \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] for a given @xmath132 , @xmath133 may change from @xmath132 ( when @xmath134 ) to @xmath135 ( when @xmath136 or @xmath137 reaches its maximal value of @xmath138 ) .",
    "besides , because @xmath139 \\ ; , \\ ] ] we have @xmath140 but the distribution of muons over @xmath141 is isotropic ( if the initial @xmath118 is not polarized ) .",
    "so from @xmath142 secondary muons only @xmath143 will have the energy fraction in the limits @xmath144 .",
    "therefore we get the following distribution @xmath145 or , substituting ( 10 ) and integrating , @xmath146x^2\\theta(r-2x)+\\ ] ] @xmath147 this spectrum is illustrated on fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "note that energy of primary muon ( not from the @xmath41 , but from the initial @xmath118 decay ) is @xmath148 , while muons from the background @xmath149 decay have equal energies of @xmath150 each . as we see muons from the @xmath151 cascade are considerably softer than muons from the most important background .",
    "therefore we expect rather clean experimental signature for the @xmath117 lepton - flavor violating decay .",
    "as we have seen , the lepton flavor violating decays , considered above , can proceed at an observable level , if the underlying 4-fermion operators are generated via recently proposed low scale quantum gravity effects , unless such operators are forbidden ( or suppressed ) by some symmetry principle .",
    "of course , the same 4-fermion operators could be generated also by some other new physics at a tev scale , not necessarily quantum gravity .",
    "so these decays are not unambiguous signals of the large extra dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental study of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays is of considerable interest , because the existing or near future facilities will allow to place a stringent limit on the lepton flavor violation in these channels , or discover this interesting phenomenon .",
