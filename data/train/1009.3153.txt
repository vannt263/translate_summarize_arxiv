    "in their papers , kreussler - kurke @xcite and poon @xcite investigated algebraic structure of generic twistor spaces on @xmath2 , the connected sum of 3 copies of complex projective planes .",
    "they showed that if the half - anticanonical system of a twistor space of @xmath0 is base point free , then the morphism associated to the system becomes a generically 2 to 1 covering map whose branch divisor is a quartic surface .",
    "further , they determined defining equation of the quartic surface ; for the most generic twistor spaces , with respect to homogeneous coordinates on @xmath3 , the equation is of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a ( homogeneous ) quadratic polynomial with real coefficients . from the equation , the intersection of the quadratic surface @xmath6 and any of the 4 plane @xmath7 is a double conic , and the intersection points of these 4 conics ( consisting of 12 points ) are ordinary double points of the quartic surface . for a generic quadratic polynomial @xmath5 , these are all singularities of the surface , but they showed that when is actually the branch divisor of the twistor spaces , the surface has one more node , which is necessarily real , so that the branch surface has 13 ordinary nodes in total . in this paper , we shall find moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath1 which can be regarded as a direct generalization of these twistor spaces on @xmath0 . more concretely , we show the following .",
    "there exist twistor spaces on @xmath1 such that ( i ) the anticanonical system is 4-dimensional as a linear system , and the image of the associated rational map is a scroll @xmath8 of 2-planes in @xmath9 over a conic , ( ii ) there is an explicit and simple elimination of the indeterminacy locus of the anticanonical map , whose resulting morphisms is a generically 2 to 1 covering map onto the scroll @xmath8 , ( iii ) the branch divisor of the last covering , which will be denoted by @xmath10 throughout this paper , is an intersection of @xmath8 with a quartic hypersurface in @xmath9 , ( iv ) if we take homogeneous coordinates on @xmath9 such that the scroll @xmath8 is defined by @xmath11 , then the quartic hypersurface is defined by the equation @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath5 are linear and quadratic polynomials with real coefficients respectively .",
    "the double covering structure and similarity of the equations with would justify to call these twistor spaces a direct generalization of those by kreussler - kurke - poon .",
    "the main tool of the present investigation is the anticanonical system of the twistor spaces . in section [ s:1 ]",
    "we start by constructing a rational surface @xmath14 which will be contained in the twistor space @xmath15 on @xmath1 as a real half - anticanonical divisor , and then clarify the structure of bi - anticanonical system on @xmath14 .",
    "next in section [ s : anticanonical ] we study the structure of the anticanonical map of the twistor spaces in detail . in section [ ss : acs ]",
    "we show that the anticanonical map induces a rational map to @xmath9 , whose image is a scroll @xmath8 of planes over a conic , and give an explicit elimination of the indeterminacy locus , obtaining a degree 2 morphism @xmath16 .",
    "next in section [ ss : modify ] we analyze the structure of the anticanonical map more in detail , and by applying some explicit blowups and blowdowns we modify the degree 2 morphism @xmath16 to another morphism @xmath17 so as to have no divisor to be contracted .",
    "up to contraction of curves , this gives the stein factorization of the morphism @xmath16 .",
    "although the modifications therein are a little bit complicated , they are rather natural in light of the structure of the anticanonical system , and indispensable for obtaining explicit construction of the twistor spaces . we also obtain a key technical result that the branch divisor of @xmath16 is a cut of @xmath8 by a quartic hypersurface .    in section [ s : defeq ] ,",
    "we explicitly determine a defining equation of the branch divisor of the double covering .",
    "for this , in section [ ss : dc ] we find 5 hyperplanes in @xmath9 such that the intersection of the branch divisor with the hyperplanes becomes double curves , i.e.a curve of multiplicity 2 .",
    "these double curves are analogous to the above 4 conics appeared in the case of @xmath0 , but to understand how they intersect each other requires some effort . in addition , in the present case , finding all the double curves is not so easy , since not all of the double curves are obtained as an image of twistor lines as in the case of @xmath0 . in section",
    "[ ss : quadric ] we show that the 5 double curves are contained in a quadratic hypersurface in @xmath9 , and that such a hyperquadric is unique up to the defining equation of the scroll @xmath8 . in section [ ss : defeq ]",
    "we prove the main result which determines the defining equation of the quartic hypersurface ( theorem [ thm : b ] ) .",
    "the equation includes not only the quadratic polynomial obtained in section [ ss : quadric ] but also a linear polynomial , which might look strange at first sight .",
    "we give an account for a geometric meaning of it . in section [ ss :",
    "sing ] we investigate singularities of the branch divisor @xmath10 of the double covering . as above @xmath10 has 5 double curves , and at most of the intersection points of them , @xmath10 has ( non - real ) ordinary double points .",
    "this is totally parallel to the case of @xmath0 explained at the beginning .",
    "but in the present case there are exactly 2 special intersection points , at which @xmath10 has @xmath18-singularities . besides these ordinary double points and @xmath18-singular points ,",
    "we show that @xmath10 has other isolated singularities and determine their basic invariants ( theorem [ thm:6sing ] ) .",
    "the result means that in general @xmath10 has extra 6 ordinary double points . for obtaining this result , as in kreussler @xcite and kreussler - kurke @xcite in the case of @xmath0 , we compute the euler numbers of the relevant spaces , especially the branch divisor @xmath10 .",
    "we also note that the concrete modification of the anticanonical map obtained in section [ ss : modify ] is crucial for determining the invariants of the singularities .    in section [ ss : moduli ]",
    "we compute dimension of the moduli space of the present twistor spaces .",
    "we first compute the dimension by counting the number of effective parameters ( coefficients ) involved in the defining quartic polynomials .",
    "next we show that some cohomology group of the twistor space an be regarded as a tangent space of the moduli space , and see that it coincides with the dimension obtained by counting the number of effective parameters .",
    "this implies a completeness of our description obtained in section [ s : defeq ] . in section [ ss : gen ]",
    "we discuss genericity of our twistor spaces among all moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath1 , indicated in the title of this paper .",
    "the genericity implies a kind of density in the moduli space of moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath1 . in the course we also give a rough classification of moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath1 under some genericity assumption .    in appendix",
    "we show that an inverse of a non - standard contraction map employed in section [ ss : modify ] can be realized by an embedded blowup with a non - singular center in the ambient space , and point out in a concrete form that the modification can be regarded as a singular version of the well - known operation of hironaka @xcite for constructing non - projective moishezon threefolds .",
    "we should also mention a relationship between this work and our previous paper @xcite . as we explained in the beginning , in the case of @xmath0 , the branch quartic divisor of the double",
    "covering becomes of the form under a genericity assumption . in non - generic cases ,",
    "as showed by kreussler - kurke @xcite , the branch divisor becomes similar but more degenerate form , and in the most degenerate situation , the branch divisor has a @xmath19-action . as a consequence , in that case the twistor spaces have a @xmath19-action .",
    "the twistor spaces studied in @xcite is a generalization of these twistor spaces ( with @xmath19-action ) to the case of @xmath20 , @xmath21 . in this respect",
    "we remark that the twistor spaces in this paper is obtained as a deformation of the twistor spaces studied in @xcite in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "it is very natural to expect that we can obtain a further generalization to the case of @xmath20 , @xmath22 .",
    "we hope to discuss this attractive topic in a future paper",

    "@xmath92    as in the proof , we use the letters @xmath544 and @xmath545 to mean the 3 double curves in the proposition .",
    "then because we know that @xmath10 is a cut of @xmath8 by a quartic hypersurface , we have @xmath546 , where @xmath547 .",

    "but if the 8 points are in a special position ( in certain precise sense ) , then the map contracts extra curves .",
    "it is not difficult to classify all positions which yield this situation .",
    "the appearance of this kind of curves is exactly the reason why the anticanonical map of the twistor spaces contracts some rational curves which can not be found from the equation of the branch divisor . _",
    "in this subsection we compute the dimension of the moduli space of our twistor spaces by counting the number of effective parameters , and verify that it agrees with the dimension of the cohomology group which is relevant to the present case .    for the former purpose , we recall from section [ s : anticanonical ] that @xmath15 canonically determines a birational model @xmath344 and the degree 2 morphism @xmath345 , and from section [ ss : defeq ] the branch divisor of @xmath368 is an intersection of @xmath8 with the quartic surface defined by @xmath847 where @xmath13 and @xmath5 are linear and quadratic polynomials with real coefficients respectively . in this subsection we denote this quartic hypersurface by @xmath848 .",
    "since the quartic hypersurface @xmath848 uniquely determines the double cover via the natural quadratic map @xmath849 ( which takes squares ) , up to small resolutions , @xmath15 is uniquely determined by the quartic hypersurface .",
    "of course , @xmath13 has 5 coefficients and @xmath5 has 15 coefficients , so the equation contains @xmath850 parameters .",
    "further it is elementary to see that two pairs @xmath851 and @xmath852 of linear and quadratic polynomials ( over @xmath853 ) determine the same hyperquartic surface if and only if @xmath854 for some @xmath855 .",
    "this decreases the number of parameters by one . on the other hand , projective transformations which preserve @xmath8 and which preserves",

    "if a pair @xmath852 is obtained from a pair @xmath851 by one of these transformations , then the intersections @xmath858 and @xmath859 are mutually biholomorphic , so that they define mutually isomorphic double cover . but taking an effect of the above equivalence @xmath860 into account , we can suppose @xmath861 and therefore these projective transformations decrease the number of parameters by 3 .",

    "clearly these transformations are not included in the above projective transformations , so they drop the dimension by one .",
    "thus we have obtained that the number of effective parameters in the quadratic hypersurface is 15 .",
    "finally , by theorem [ thm:6sing ] , the pair @xmath851 must satisfy the constraint that @xmath865 has extra 6 ordinary double points in general , which decreases the number of parameters by 6 . therefore we conclude that _ the space of isomorphic classes of the divisors of the form @xmath865 , which can be the branch divisor for the twistor spaces under consideration , is @xmath866-dimensional_.    next we compute the dimension of the moduli space of our twistor spaces by determining the dimension of the first cohomology group of an appropriate subsheaf of the tangent sheaf .",

    ", we deduce that ( c ) can not happen under our assumption . if @xmath931 has a multiple component , since there exists no real @xmath44-curve , it must be a real @xmath42-curve . but this can not happen since as remarked above among the 8 points there is at least one point on any irreducible component of @xmath931 , contradicting the family of twistor lines on @xmath14 . hence in both cases",
    "( a ) and ( b ) @xmath931 has no multiple component .",
    "next we show that in the case ( a ) there is an irreducible component of @xmath931 on which precisely @xmath967 points among the 8 points lie . if not , then because we are excluding lebrun twistor spaces , on each of the 4 irreducible components exactly 2 points are lying among the 8 points . in this case , the restriction @xmath968|_{c}$ ] belongs to pic@xmath969 , which again implies @xmath970 for any @xmath961 as in the above case .",
    "this implies that @xmath15 is not moishezon .",
    "hence the component actually exists .",
    "next we prove that if @xmath931 is in the case ( b ) , there exists another birational morphism @xmath971 preserving the real structure such that @xmath972 falls into the case ( a ) , and such that the images of twistor lines in @xmath14 are @xmath42-curves . for this",
    "we write @xmath973 with @xmath43 and @xmath81 being irreducible @xmath951-curves .",
    "if exactly 4 points belong to @xmath43 , then the remaining 4 points belong to @xmath81 , and also no point coincides with the 2 points @xmath974 . then by a similar reason for the case ( a ) , this implies that @xmath15 is not moishezon .",
    "so the 2 points @xmath974 are included in the 8 points .",
    "therefore @xmath920 factors as @xmath975 where the latter arrow is the blowup at @xmath974 .",
    "we obtain 6 points on @xmath976 as the images of the exceptional curves of @xmath977 .",
    "these 6 points are not on the exceptional curves of @xmath978 by the assumption that the 8 points are distinct .",
    "this implies that the unique anticanonical curve @xmath54 on @xmath14 is a cycle of 4 rational curves , whose self - intersection numbers are @xmath979 .",
    "then for another blowdown @xmath980 in the proposition , it is enough to choose a blowingdown @xmath981 which does not contract the 2 exceptional curves of the original @xmath982 , and composite it with the morphism @xmath977 .",
    "thus we obtained another @xmath980 as claimed , and we can neglect the case ( b ) .    hence @xmath931 can be supposed to be in the case ( a ) and that there is at least one component on which exactly 3 points among 8 points lie .",
    "this directly means the 8 points have to be put on @xmath931 arranged as in ( ii ) , ( iii ) or ( iv ) , as claimed .",
    "@xmath92    needless to say , the case ( ii ) of proposition [ prop : density ] is exactly the situation we have investigated in this paper . since it is clear that all other 3 cases ( ( i ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) can be obtained as small deformations of the case ( ii ) , it would be reasonable to say that among the surface @xmath14 obtained from the 8 points arranged as in ( i)(iv ) , the case ( ii ) is most generic . by deformation theory including a co - stability theorem of horikawa @xcite , the same is true for the twistor spaces containing these surfaces .",
    "namely any twistor spaces on @xmath1 which has @xmath14 obtained from ( i ) , ( iii ) and ( iv ) as a real member of @xmath35 can be obtained as a limit of the twistor spaces investigated in this paper . in particular , the present twistor spaces can be obtained as a small deformation of a lebrun twistor space , and this proves the existence of our twistor spaces .",
    "we also remark that by using the horikawa s theorem , it is possible to show that the present twistor spaces can also be obtained as a small deformation of the twistor spaces studied in @xcite ( on @xmath1 , of course ) .",
    "these are the reason why we call the present twistor spaces to be generic .",
    "finally we remark that a converse of proposition [ prop : density ] also holds .",
    "namely if a twistor space @xmath15 on @xmath1 has real irreducible @xmath189 which is obtained from the 8 points in the case ( ii ) , ( iii ) , or ( iv ) , then @xmath133 and @xmath15 is moishezon .",
    "concerning structure of these twistor spaces , the case ( iii ) can be regarded as a mild degeneration of the present twistor spaces , in the sense that the twistor space still has a double covering structure over the scroll @xmath8 by the anticanonical system .",
    "these twistor spaces ( having @xmath14 obtained from the configuration ( iii ) ) are analogous to a double solid twistor spaces on @xmath0 of a degenerate form found by kreussler - kurke ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , case ( b ) ) .",
    "here we mention that there is _ one more _ another type of twistor spaces on @xmath1 of a degenerate form which do not admit @xmath19-action .",
    "we will study these 2 kinds of double solid twistor spaces on @xmath1 in a separate paper . on the other hand , although moishezon , it turns out that the remaining case ( iv ) does not have structure of double solids , because the anticanonical map of the twistor spaces becomes birational .",
    "so they are rather similar to the twistor spaces of joyce metrics on @xmath1 of non - lebrun type @xcite .",
    "but contrary to the joyce s case , explicit realization of the anticanonical model seems difficult .",
    "we recall from section [ ss : modify ] that the singular variety @xmath344 is obtained from the twistor space @xmath15 via non - singular spaces @xmath984 and @xmath310 , and the transformations therein are standard until getting @xmath310 . on the other hand , the map @xmath337 contracts the reducible connected divisor @xmath985 to a reducible connected curve @xmath780 , and there we used fujiki s contraction theorem .",
    "one would wish to find such a birational morphism through the usual procedure of blowups with non - singular center . in this subsection",
    ", we explicitly see that an embedded blowup at and a small resolution provide the desired situation and point out that the process is in a sense a singular version of the hironaka s construction of non - projective moishezon 3-folds .",
    "for this we consider the double covering of @xmath8 with branch @xmath10 which is the intersection with the quartic hypersurface .",
    "recall that @xmath765 , and @xmath586 consists of two points @xmath986 . as before let @xmath115 be any one of the two points and we work in a neighborhood of @xmath115 as the situation around @xmath116 can see by just taking the image under the real structure . as in the proof of proposition",
    "[ prop : a3 ] , putting @xmath987 and @xmath988 , we can use @xmath769 as coordinates in a neighborhood of @xmath115 in @xmath770 , and we may suppose that the hyperquartic is defined by @xmath772 , while @xmath8 is defined by @xmath773 .",
    "next for studying the structure of the double covering , we introduce another coordinate @xmath989 over the neighborhood of @xmath115 , so that the double cover is defined by @xmath990 ( this is the equation of @xmath344 around the points @xmath343 we promised in section [ ss : modify ] . )",
    "let @xmath991 be this double covering and @xmath992 the projection .",
    "( of course this is valid only in a neighborhood of @xmath115 . )",
    "the singular locus of @xmath991 is @xmath993 which is a union of 2 lines , and @xmath991 has a@xmath994-singularities along these lines minus the origin .",
    "we note that substituting @xmath995 to @xmath773 , we obtain that @xmath991 contains the following distinguished 4 surfaces @xmath996 then obviously we have @xmath997 .",
    "so if we let @xmath998 to be the blowup at the plane @xmath999 and @xmath1000 to mean the strict transform of @xmath991 , then @xmath1001 is an embedded blowup at sing@xmath991 .",
    "then by concrete computations using coordinates it is not difficult to see that the exceptional locus of @xmath1001 consists of 2 irreducible divisors which are over the 2 lines respectively , that the inverse image of the origin is a non - singular rational curve , and that the singularities of @xmath1000 consists of 2 points lying on this rational curve , both of which are ordinary double points .",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate a family of moishezon twistor spaces on the connected sum of 4 complex projective planes , which can be regarded as a direct generalization of the twistor spaces on @xmath0 of double solid type studied by poon and kreussler - kurke . </S>",
    "<S> these twistor spaces have a natural structure of double covering over a scroll of 2-planes over a conic . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the defining equations of the branch divisors in an explicit form , which are very similar to the case of @xmath0 . using these explicit description </S>",
    "<S> we compute the dimension of the moduli spaces of these twistor spaces . </S>",
    "<S> also we observe that similarly to the case of @xmath0 , these twistor spaces can also be considered as generic moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain these results by analyzing the anticanonical map of the twistor spaces in detail , which enables us to give an explicit construction of the twistor spaces , up to small resolutions . </S>"
