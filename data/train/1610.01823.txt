    "the search for the underlying mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity in cuprates remains active for three decades after its discovery @xcite .",

    " normal \" state , above the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 , there is an exotic pseudogap phase whose origin and relation to the superconducting phase are still much debated @xcite .",
    "more recently , evidence of charge order , or charge density wave ( cdw ) , within the cuo@xmath7 planes has been found , below optimal doping , in several families , @xcite further increasing the complexity of the cuprates phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the temperature evolution of cdw @xcite and its behavior under magnetic fields @xcite have indicated that charge order is in competition with superconductivity .",
    "although the phenomenology of cdw has grown fast , it is still patchy and a systematic knowledge of its doping evolution would help clarify its role in high-@xmath0 superconductivity and its relation with the quantum critical points ( qcp ) in the phase diagram .",
    "early evidence of bulk charge order was obtained in la - based cuprates by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) near the hole doping @xmath12 [ , ] and later by x - ray scattering with an approximately commensurate wave - vector @xmath13 reciprocal lattice units ( rlu ) [ ] .",
    "more recently , an incommensurate charge order at @xmath14 rlu along the cu - o bond direction , has been observed by various techniques in ( y , nd)ba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 ( ybco , nbco)@xcite , which might be responsible for the fermi surface reconstructions in high magnetic fields giving rise to quantum oscillations @xcite .",
    "soon after , the enhanced sensitivity of resonant x - ray scattering has also allowed the detection of a short - range charge order in bi@xmath7sr@xmath2la@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( bi2201 ) [ ] , bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath15 ( bi2212 ) [ , ] and hgba@xmath7cuo@xmath16 [ ] , and eventually in electron - doped ( nd , la)@xmath2ce@xmath3cuo@xmath10 [ , ] , indicating its ubiquity in cuprate superconductors .",
    "hereafter we will confine our discussion to hole - doped systems for brevity .",
    "the cdw is strongest in the underdoped regime and persists up to optimal doping @xcite . in bi2201 ,",
    "the charge order was observed by resonant x - ray scattering ( rxs ) in the underdoped region ( @xmath17 ) with wave vector , decreasing with @xmath18 , that was proposed to match the distance between the tips of the ungapped segments of fermi surface ( `` fermi arcs '' ) @xcite .",
    "a previous resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) study on optimally doped bi2201 ( op - bi2201 ) has not found a charge order signal directly @xcite . instead",
    "a low energy feature at @xmath19 rlu was observed up to 200k and was attributed to a phonon signal .",
    "on the other hand , in op - bi2201 angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has shown a particle - hole symmetry breaking and a phase transition below the pseudogap temperature @xcite . and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has found a checkerboard - like electronic modulation in a broad doping range of bi2201 [ ] .",
    "however , electronic states may vary in bulk ( studied with x - rays ) and at the surface ( studied with stm and arpes ) .",
    "the discrepancy between bulk and surface measurements calls for a more accurate investigation : here , by using high resolution rixs at the cu @xmath5 edge , we study the charge order in underdoped ( @xmath20k , ud15k ) and optimally doped ( @xmath21k , op33k ) bi@xmath1sr@xmath2la@xmath3cuo@xmath4 . we will focus on the quasi - elastic spectral component that is sensitive to charge modulations @xcite . along the cu - o bond direction , we observed a bulk charge order peak at incommensurate vector @xmath22 ( 0.23 ) rlu in ud15k ( op33k ) .",
    "this expands up to optimal doping the region where charge order , superconductivity and pseudogap coexist in b2201 .",
    "we also performed temperature measurements on op33k across @xmath0 and @xmath23 to investigate the relations between charge order , superconductivity and pseudogap .",
    "we noticed that a prior energy - integrated rxs measurement on bi2201 reported no cdw signatures along the diagonal ( nodal ) direction @xcite .",

    "the difference increases with doping and reaches 35@xmath73 in the optimal doping , which is out of the error tolerance .",

    "it is known that the carrier concentration is different at the surface and in the bulk , and that the difference grows with doping .",
    "the cdw order arising from the charge modulations can reflect this dichotomy : indeed at low doping @xmath74 the @xmath43 vectors are similar between rxs and stm results , while they separate into two trends and departs further with doping .",
    "a recent stm work , by utilizing the phase - resolved electronic structure visualization , has revealed a surprising doping independent locking of the local cdw wavevector at 0.25 rlu throughout the underdoped phase diagram of ( bi - layer ) bi2212 [ ] . while the generality of this lattice - commensurability cdw in other cuprates , and the supposed correlation with x - ray scattering results through phase slips between different short - ranged correlated domains",

    "if compared to other cuprates , charge order in bi2201 is rather short - ranged , with a real - space correlation length between 17  and 23  , similar to @xmath75  in bi2212 [ ] , but shorter than @xmath76  in ybco [ ] and @xmath77  in lbco [ , ] .",
    "probably lager disorder ( e.g. chemical inhomogeneity ) plays a bigger role in bi2201 and bi2212 [ ] . there is still no report of charge order in overdoped regime of cuprates . for bi2201",
    "the pseudogap state extends to the heavily overdoped regime , which is well defined by the nmr measurements @xcite ( fig .",
    "therefore the end point of pseudogap state does not coincide with the end point of charge order in bi2201 .",
    "also in ybco the high magnetic field hall coefficient measurements showed that the fermi surface reconstruction by charge order ended at the optimal doping _ _ p__=0.16 [ ] , which is distinctly lower than the pseudogap critical point _ _ p__=0.19 [ ] .",
    "as keimer et al .",
    "[ ] have already pointed out , the pseudogap is characterized by several competing ordering tendencies and it would not be surprising that the critical points between pseudogap and charge order do not coincide , although the opposite is not excluded too . moreover , which termination point ( as determined by fermi surface reconstruction @xcite , symmetry breaking @xcite , divergent effective mass @xcite , etc . )",
    "actually relates to the qcp is hotly debated , and there is a need for further experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "besides the in - plane components , x - ray studies of the charge order in ybco and lbco have reported an additional correlation along the _ c_-direction @xcite .",
    "this depends on the relative ( from plane to plane ) phase of the cdw modulations along the _ c_-direction . in zero magnetic field ,",
    "x - ray diffraction of the ionic displacements in ybco [ ] revealed a weak anti - phase correlation in neighboring bilayers , which results in the cdw peaking at half - integral values of _ l_. this finite _ c_-axis coherence of the cdw is rather short - range , with a length of @xmath78 (i.e .",
    "approximately the distance between two adjacent bi - layers ) @xcite . by applying high magnetic fields ( typically @xmath79 t ) ,",
    "the _ c_-direction behavior of the cdw evolves differently along the _ a_- and _ b_-directions : the correlation simply becomes stronger in _ a_-direction while a new peak appears at _ _",
    "l__=1 along the _",
    "b_-direction with increasing correlation length @xmath80 [ ] .",
    "this means the cdws propagating along the _",

    "b_-axis lock their phase with neighboring bi - layers . in lbco",
    "the charge stipe order also exhibits broad maxima at half - integer _",
    ", indicative of a twofold periodicity along the _ c _ axis @xcite .",
    "the reason is that in adjacent planes within one unit cell the stripes align in orthogonal directions arising from the tilting pattern of the cuo@xmath81 octahedra .",
    "in addition , the charge order is offset by @xmath82 between successive unit cells , presumably to minimize coulomb repulsion , resulting in an antiphase relationship between next - nearest - neighbor cuo@xmath7 planes @xcite .",
    "this out - of - plane correlation is very short - ranged @xmath83 @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) and can be enhanced by a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , our @xmath86-direction study of cdw in bi2201 does not show any peak , indicating there is no phase correlation of cdw along the _ c_-direction .",
    "the underlying reason can be the following : the distance between the adjacent cu - o planes in bi2201 is @xmath87  within one unit cell , and neighboring planes are offset by ( 0.5,0.5 ) : cdw correlation is discouraged both by distance and crystalline mismatch , resulting in random phases along the _ c_-direction .",
    "there is no high magnetic field measurement on bi2201 yet , but the 2d cdw is to be expected , since the coupling between the two cu@xmath88 planes within one unit cell is rather weak , let alone the coupling between two unit cells . for double layer bi2212 , we infer that the charge order also has no phase correlation along the _ c_-direction , because the distance between two bilayers is @xmath4712.3  , much larger than in ybco ( @xmath478.5  ) , which maybe also discouraged by the ( 0.5,0.5 ) offset .",
    "we have directly observed a bulk , incommensurate charge order in ud15k and op33k , demonstrating that the short - range charge density modulations persist up to optimal doping in bi2201 . both the cdw intensity and correlation length decrease with doping .",
    "in addition , the cdw vector decreases with doping , showing a bulk / surface dichotomy from rxs and stm measurements .",
    "the doping range of charge order in bi2201 , @xmath89 with @xmath69@xmath720.07 and @xmath71@xmath720.16 , suggests the critical points of charge order are different from those of af , sc and pseudogap . thus , charge order appears to be a separate phenomenon that coexists with af , sc and pseudogap .",
    "temperature measurements have demonstrated that it competes with superconductivity and the signal disappears across @xmath23 due to fluctuations . whether and how it relates to qcp for the mechanism of high-@xmath0 superconductivity requires future experimental and theoretical research .",
    "furthermore , we confirmed there is no charge order along the diagonal direction , suggesting the cdw propagates only along the cu - o bond direction .",
    "this fact is also compatible with the observed _ l_-independence of cdw , indicating there is no phase correlations along the _",
    "c_-direction at variance to ybco and lbco , and hinting at a perfectly two - dimensional charge ordering in single layer bi2201 .",

    "<S> charge order in underdoped and optimally doped high-@xmath0 superconductors bi@xmath1sr@xmath2la@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( bi2201 ) is investigated by cu @xmath5 edge resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have directly observed charge density modulation in the optimally doped bi2201 at momentum transfer @xmath6 rlu , with smaller intensity and correlation length with respect to the underdoped sample . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the short - range charge order in bi2201 persists up to optimal doping , as in other hole - doped cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> we explored the nodal ( diagonal ) direction and found no charge order peak , confirming that charge order modulates only along the cu - o bond directions . </S>",
    "<S> we measured the out - of - plane dependence of charge order , finding a flat response and no maxima at half integer _ </S>",
    "<S> l _ </S>",
    "<S> values . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests there is no out - of - plane phase correlation in single layer bi2201 , at variance from yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 and la@xmath2(ba , sr)@xmath3cuo@xmath10 . combining our results with data from the literature </S>",
    "<S> we assess that charge order in bi2201 exists in a large doping range across the phase diagram , i.e. @xmath11 , demonstrating thereby that it is intimately entangled with the antiferromagnetic background , the pseudogap and superconductivity . </S>"
