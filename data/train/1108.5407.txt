    "in the last few years , great experimental advances have permitted the manipulation of trapped neutral ultracold two - spin - components atomic fermi gases with tremendous accuracy .",
    "the essential technics under full domain are the cooling , trapping , the control of the number of atoms in the sample , and the tunning of the inter - atomic ( s - wave ) interactions via the application of an external uniform magnetic ( feshbach resonance ) field  @xcite .",
    "this allowed the investigation of the crossover from the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase of weakly bound cooper pairs to the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) phase of strongly bound diatomic molecules in three - dimensional ( 3d ) trapped fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "these many - body quantum gases are even more exciting when the two - components have mass , chemical potential or population imbalance , since this situation can be met in many areas of physics , from condensed matter to high - density quark matter .",
    "many exotic phases have been proposed as the ground state of these imbalanced fermi gases , such as the homogeneous sarma  @xcite or breached - pair state  @xcite , the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state with modulated order parameter  @xcite , phase separation of superfluid and normal components in real space  @xcite , deformed fermi surfaces  @xcite , and magnetized superfluid in the bec side of the resonance  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments in imbalanced atomic fermi gases confined in 3d harmonic traps have observed that these systems phase separate into a unpolarized superfluid core surrounded by a normal outer region  @xcite .",
    "the observation of the fflo state is an experimental challenge , since it is predicted to exist only in a narrow window of asymmetry between the particle s chemical potentials .",
    "indeed recent experiments of shin et al .",
    "@xcite have not observed any evidence of the exotic fflo state in 3d .",
    "however , lower dimensions may favor fflo due to the nesting of the fermi surfaces , as in the recent experiments with two spin mixture of ultracold @xmath6 atoms trapped in an array of one dimensional ( 1d ) tubes , where fflo - like correlations were found for a range of polarizations  @xcite .",
    "thus , another very important parameter under control is the trap geometry , which permits the experimental investigation of fermionic atoms in lower dimensions .",
    "a two - dimensional ( 2d ) trapped fermi gas may be achieved in experiments by flattening magnetic or dipolar confinements  @xcite , by trapping atoms in specially designed pancake potentials  @xcite , by radio frequency ( rf)-induced two - dimensional traps  @xcite , by gravito - optical surface traps  @xcite . due to these experimental advances ,",
    "recent studies have reported various features of 2d balanced fermi gases : a 2d fermi gas of atoms has been prepared and directly observed @xcite , the first realization of a strongly interacting 2d fermi gas of atoms has been reported  @xcite , the pairing pseudogap in a 2d fermi gas in the strong coupling regime has been explored  @xcite , the biding energy of fermion pairs was measured along the dimensional crossover from 3d to 2d  @xcite , and in ref .  @xcite the contributions of the effective - range corrections to two - body bound - state energies were considered .    inspired by these experimental progresses ,",
    "some recent papers have investigated two - component fermi gases both in 2d  @xcite , as well as in one - dimensional ( 1d ) fermi systems as , for instance , in refs .  @xcite . besides , spin imbalance has also been investigated in the context of metallic systems as , for example , electron - hole bilayer  @xcite and multi - band  @xcite systems .    in the imbalanced scenario , much effort has been dedicated to study the fermi polaron problem in which a single spin-@xmath7 atom interacts strongly with a fermi sea of spin-@xmath8 atoms  @xcite .",
    "fermi polarons were observed in a tunable fermi liquid of ultracold atoms  @xcite , and experimental evidence for the polaron - molecule transition was recently found  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the zero temperature ( @xmath9 ) ground state of a 2d atomic fermi gas with chemical potential and population imbalance in the mean - field approximation . in this analysis",
    "we do not consider the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) corrections  @xcite to the mean - field results in 2d .",
    "bkt corrections to mean - field results are more important close ( and below ) a certain critical temperature @xmath10 , while at @xmath11 , as considered in the present paper , all the vortices and antivortices are bound in molecules , so bkt corrections are not relevant .",
    "the ( topological ) bkt transition has been investigated in 2d balanced  @xcite , as well as imbalanced systems  @xcite , by taking into account the phase fluctuation effect .",
    "we show that in the grand canonical ensemble the fundamental state is bcs up to a critical value of the chemical potentials asymmetry @xmath1 , after which there is a quantum phase transition to the normal state . in the canonical ensemble we study in detail the issue of phase separation .",
    "we show that the normal phase is always unstable to phase separation when the density asymmetry @xmath4 is less than the critical imbalance @xmath5 .",
    "all calculations are performed in terms of the two - body binding energy @xmath0 , whose variation allows to investigate the evolution from the bec to the bcs regimes .",
    "the possibility of the fflo state is ignored in this work , and we only consider pairing between atoms with equal and opposite momentum .    the main results of this paper may be summarized as : we show that in a zero @xmath9 imbalanced 2d gas of fermionic atoms , bcs is the ground state up to chemical potentials imbalance @xmath1 at which there is a first - order phase transition to the normal state .",
    "we find that @xmath1 is the same as in 3d , namely , the chandrasekhar - clogston limit of superfluidity .",
    "we demonstrate that , as found theoretically and experimentally in 3d , for a fixed two - body binding energy @xmath0 , as the imbalance @xmath4 is increased from zero the stable states are bcs , phase separation and normal phase . for balanced systems ,",
    "the bcs - bec crossover is governed only by @xmath0 . however , for imbalanced systems , the bcs - bec crossover will depend on @xmath0 and the imbalance @xmath4 . for a fix value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the crossover is possible only for asymmetries supported by phase separation . above a critical value of the number densities imbalance @xmath5 ,",
    "phase separation is destroyed ( in favor of the normal phase ) as well as the path to bec regime .",
    "we investigate the conditions for the existence of bound states in the balanced and imbalanced normal phase .",
    "we find that in the balanced normal phase at zero temperature , there will be bound states for any value of the two - body binding energy .",
    "for the imbalanced normal configuration , we find that stable ( and real ) bound states exist when @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the chemical potential imbalance . as we point out in section  [ comp ] , the results we obtain in the canonical ensemble agree with previous works which employed the grand canonical ensemble , as it should be , since the phase diagram should be independent of this choice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ int ] we present the model hamiltonian and derive an analytical expression for the zero temperature thermodynamical potential in the mean - field approximation for the two - component gas of fermionic atoms in 2d . in sec .",

    "we start by considering a 2d nonrelativistic dilute system of fermionic atoms of mass @xmath14 , with two hyperfine states labeled as @xmath15 .",
    "this spin @xmath8 and @xmath7 mixture can be done with the two lowest hyperfine states of @xmath16 atoms , as in the 3d experiments  @xcite .",
    "this 2d system may be experimentally realized confining a 3d fermi gas into a single layer ( or a stack of layers ) by a tight transverse harmonic oscillator potential @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the trapping frequency along the confined direction .",

    "since at low densities ( appropriate to describe the ultracold trapped fermi gases we are interested ) the form of the potential is not probed , it can be considered that the atoms interact via a contact interaction which is modeled by the following pairing hamiltonian :    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    is the kinetic ( free ) part of @xmath24 and @xmath25 is given below . @xmath26 and @xmath27 in eq .",

    "we have shown that if you change the ensemble the results are the same , as expected , since it is known that the physics can not depend on the ensemble used , and we have verified this in detail .",
    "similar studies and results can be found in other very interesting and recent papers  @xcite , and we have obtained the same results of these papers where the order of the phase transition from bcs to normal state at a critical chemical potential imbalanced is first order . results ii mentioned in our introduction also agree with the results found in  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the mean - field zero @xmath9 phase diagram of an imbalanced fermi gas was investigated when there is also mass imbalance .",
    "although they did not consider phase separation , they studied the influence of population and mass imbalance on the different fermi surfaces topologies , associated to stable and unstable phases .",
    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xmath62 has been taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite in a imbalanced 2d fermi gas , and it was found that for large values of the soc there is a topological phase transition from phase separation to a nontrivial superfluid phase .",
    "our phase diagram of fig .",
    "2 is in complete agreement with the ( @xmath231 i.e. , the vertical axes of the ) zero @xmath9 mean - field phase diagrams of fig . 1 shown in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated superfluidity in two - dimensional imbalanced fermi gases . with exact expressions ,",
    "we have constructed the zero temperature mean - field phase diagram of these systems .",
    "we show that in the grand canonical ensemble , bcs is the ground state up to a critical chemical potential imbalance @xmath1 at which there is a first - order phase transition to the normal state . in the canonical ensemble , relevant to current experiments ,",
    "we also show that , as found theoretically and experimentally in 3d , for a fixed two - body binding energy @xmath0 , as the imbalance @xmath4 is increased from zero the stable states are bcs , phase separation and normal phase .    regarding the bcs - bec crossover , in balanced systems it is governed only by @xmath0 .",
    "however , for imbalanced systems , the bcs - bec crossover will depend on @xmath0 and the imbalance @xmath4 . for a fix value of @xmath0 ,",
    "the crossover is possible only for asymmetries supported by phase separation . above a critical value of the number densities imbalance @xmath5 ,",
    "phase separation is destroyed in favor of the normal phase , as well as the path to bec regime .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath232 such that the system phase separates into bcs and normal phases , the bec regime can be accessed by varying @xmath0 from the weak to strong couplings .",
    "a smaller and smaller circular core shall be visibly apparent , as @xmath0 is increased , signalizing the condensation of the cooper pairs .",
    "this is a direct prediction of our results that could be tested experimentally .",
    "we have investigated the conditions for the existence of bound states in the normal phase .",
    "as we have seen , since a two - body bound state exists even for an arbitrarily small attraction in 2d , the normal balanced state at @xmath66 corresponds to the superfluid case . in the imbalanced normal phase ,",
    "bound states are likely to be formed provided @xmath12 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction section , the fermi polaron problem appears in a very large imbalance @xmath233 or , in the unities of fig .",
    "[ pd ] , @xmath234 .",
    "in this situation , the minority species @xmath80 correspond to impurities immersed in the majority species @xmath81 fermi liquid . as the interaction @xmath235",
    "is increased , the impurities @xmath80 surround themselves with a localized cloud of environment @xmath81 atoms , forming fermi polarons  @xcite .",
    "a very interesting phenomena that could also be verified experimentally appears when the value of @xmath235 is fixed and the number of impurities is increased , i.e. , one starts with an imbalance @xmath236 and end up with @xmath232 . in this way",
    ", we expect a transition from polarons to phase separation configuration , since evidence of quasiparticle interactions have been found as the concentration of @xmath80 species were increased in the fermi sea of @xmath81 atoms  @xcite .",
    "finally , we hope that the analytical expressions we have obtained here could be useful for other works studying 2d imbalanced fermi gases .",
