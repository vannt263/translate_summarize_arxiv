    "lang and kohn@xcite introduced the center of mass positions @xmath25 of the induced surface charge density at the electrodes and related the distance between the center of mass positions to the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor in the vacuum ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 .",

    "configs]b ) with the appropriate electron energies to drastically alter the capacitance .",
    "therefore , besides optimizing the thickness and the dielectric properties of the dielectric layer , choosing the appropriate materials of the electrode surfaces provides an independent access to optimizing the capacitance of capacitors .",
    "materials of interest include materials with small electron densities , such as interfaces in oxide heterostructures , low - electron density metals , materials with strong electronic correlations such as transition metal oxides , or graphene - based systems .    because the capacitance of such capacitors is controlled by the energy of the electron system of the plates rather than by the field energy , the standard parallel - plate configuration is not needed to obtain large capacitances or field strengths ( for example , in fig .",
    "[ configs]a all blue surfaces contribute to the capacitance @xmath212 in eq .",
    "( [ capacitance ] ) ) . rather , the surface areas of the electrodes are important .",
    "we note that the desired modification of the capacitance does not require that the electrodes consist entirely of strongly correlated compounds .",
    "it is sufficient to coat the active surface of an electrode with a thin layer of a correlated material , because the net charges are repelled from the interiors of the electrodes .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath213 is a property of the electrode materials and , specifically , it relates to the properties of the materials at their surfaces .",
    "@xmath214 therefore can be tuned by coating the electrodes with thin layers of desired materials and then is given by the dielectric constant of the coating material .",
    "it accounts for the polarizability of the ionic cores and also includes the short - range screening processes from excitations in the adjacent material layers , but not the contributions from the electron gas itself .",
    "the effective dielectric constant @xmath213 is , beyond linear response , also dependent on the charge density .",
    "such a dependence induces feedback effects which alter the capacitance .",
    "while one may consider to estimate @xmath213 from an lda evaluation for the specific heterostructure , there is no simple scheme to calculate @xmath213 .",
    "lacking such a simple scheme , we calculated the capacitance of a simple `` model capacitor '' for several values of @xmath213 .        using optimized capacitor configurations , it is in principle possible to build capacitors that are characterized by a negative capacitance for zero applied voltage .",
    "such capacitors charge themselves to generate finite electric fields and , although they do not contain any ferroelectric component , show parallels to ferroelectric devices .",
    "it is obvious , that for device applications novel possibilities are opened by adding truly ferroelectric layers to structures with unconventional capacities .",
    "intriguing characteristics arise if the capacitances are negative .    in the case of negative compressibility , adding or removing an electron from an electrode involves less energy than the standard work function or electron affinity .",
    "it is intriguing to regard the behavior of the electrons in a single electrode or on the two electrodes of a capacitor , in case the compressibility of at least one electron system is negative . in a capacitor that",
    "self charges , for example , into a positively and negatively charged plate , the electrons and the holes in the two plates interact across the dielectric by their coulomb field .",
    "it seems possible that electron - hole pairs result that form a coherent state , and , for example modify pairing in a superconducting electrode .",
    "such effects may be particularly useful in case the plate capacitor is designed as a transmission line .",
    "we propose that such a superconducting state may even exist if none of the electrodes is superconducting by itself .",
    "even for electron systems with positive compressibilities , the coulomb energies caused by the presence of a second plate will lower or enhance the @xmath215 of a superconducting electrode .",
    "therefore , modifying coulomb energies by using capacitor - type configurations , the electrodes of which may even consist of the same materials , offers new possibilities to realize superconductors .    also ,",
    "because the capacitance can be controlled by the electronic system of the plates , which may be strongly correlated electron systems that are sensitive to magnetic fields , materials may be designed from capacitor - derived multilayer configurations that yield large multiferroic coupling at room temperature .",
    "capacitors for which the non - geometrical capacitances are important , and in which one plate has a non - homogeneous composition , are characterized by inhomogeneous and unusual electric field distributions .",
    "the charge distribution of such an electrode is modified and differs from the charge distribution generated in the corresponding standard configuration .",
    "consequently , in the presence of an electric field , the distribution of the field lines is accordingly altered . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fieldfocus ] , electric field lines can , for example , be focused onto desired areas to extract charges .",
    "or , where desirable , areas can be shielded from electric fields , which may be important to prevent electric breakthrough phenomena .",
    "thus , inhomogeneous electrodes allow to generate desirable distributions of charge densities and electric fields without altering the overall geometrical configuration of a device .",
