    "molecular gas in galaxy mergers is largely influenced by merger - induced physical processes , and obtaining observational constraints on the spatial distribution and dynamics of molecular gas in merging lirgs is important to our understanding of gas - rich galaxy merger processes .",
    "( sub)millimeter interferometric observations of rotational j - transition lines of molecular gas are a powerful tool for this purpose .",
    "high - sensitivity , high - spatial - resolution ( @xmath9a few arcsec ) interferometric observations of merging lirgs using bright co molecular lines have been widely performed @xcite .",
    "these co observations at low - j transitions ( j = 10 and 21 ) have effectively traced the low - density ( 10@xmath10 @xmath11 ) molecular gas properties in great detail due to the low dipole moment of co ( @xmath4 @xmath1 0.1 debye ) . however , in merging lirgs , the fraction of high density ( @xmath310@xmath12 @xmath11 ) molecular gas is much higher than in normal quiescent star - forming galaxies @xcite , and it is within such high - density gas that stars are actually born .",
    "thus , it is vital to obtain observational constraints of the properties of high - density molecular gas in merging lirgs if we are to understand the essential physical processes in gas - rich galaxy mergers",
    ".    observations of molecular gas with high dipole moments , such as hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc ( @xmath4 @xmath3 3 debye ) , can effectively probe high - density molecular gas .",
    "however , these molecular lines are generally much fainter than the bright co lines , and the spatial information of dense gas is still limited to nearby , very bright merging lirgs only @xcite . from these previously performed observations",
    ", it has been shown that the spatial distribution of high - density molecular gas is significantly different from that of low - density molecular gas , in that high - density gas is more concentrated in the nuclear regions of galaxies @xcite . in merging lirgs ,",
    "it is in the nuclear regions where very violent processes , including starbursts (= active star - formation ) and active mass accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) occur .",
    "additionally , feedback to the surrounding interstellar medium and entire galaxy , if present , originates from these regions @xcite .",
    "spatially resolved interferometric observations using dense gas tracers are of particular importance in investigating the interesting nuclear regions of merging lirgs .",
    "starburst and active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity powered by a mass - accreting smbh can have different effects / feedback on the surrounding dense molecular gas at the merging lirg s nuclei .",
    "it is proposed that starburst and agn activity could be distinguishable based on the line flux ratios of dense molecular gas tracers @xcite because ( 1 ) an agn has an energy source with a much higher emission surface brightness than a starburst , and thus it can heat the surrounding dust and gas to higher temperature ; and ( 2 ) an agn emits stronger x - rays than a starburst does . both of these factors could alter the chemical compositions of molecular gas in agns compared with starbursts @xcite ; therefore , agns and starbursts could exhibit different molecular line flux ratios .",
    "high - spatial - resolution interferometric observations of multiple dense gas tracers can thus be used to scrutinize the processes deep inside the obscuring dust and gas in merging lirg nuclei . with the advent of alma ,",
    "such observations are now feasible .",
    "ngc 1614 ( z = 0.016 ; l@xmath7 = 10@xmath13l@xmath6 ) is a well - studied , nearby lirg .",
    "merging signatures are clearly seen in the optical and near - infrared ( 12.5 @xmath4 m ) images as long , prominent tails around a single nucleus @xcite .",
    "it is classified as a starburst galaxy through optical spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the infrared 2.530 @xmath4 m spectrum of ngc 1614 is typical of a starburst - dominated galaxy with no agn signature @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of the starburst - generated 3.3 @xmath4 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature and the br@xmath14 ( 4.05 @xmath4 m ) hydrogen emission , measured through slitless spectroscopy and calculated relative to the total infrared ( 81000 @xmath4 m ) luminosity , are both as high as in starburst - dominated galaxies @xcite , suggesting that the observed luminosity of ngc 1614 is totally accounted for by the detected starbursts , with no need for a significant agn contribution .",
    "the infrared @xmath15-band ( 2.2 @xmath4 m ) spectrum shows a strong stellar - origin 2.3 @xmath4 m co absorption feature @xcite and so supports the starburst - dominated scenario .",
    "high - spatial - resolution infrared 820 @xmath4 m imaging observations reveal spatially extended , but compact ( @xmath12@xmath2 ) , starburst - heated dust continuum emission @xcite , and the measured emission surface brightness is within the range explained by star formation , again requiring no significant contribution from an energetically important agn @xcite .",
    "the pa@xmath14 ( 1.88 @xmath4 m ) emission from star - forming hii - regions is dominated by nuclear @xmath13@xmath2 area @xcite , which suggests that most of starburst activity in ngc 1614 is concentrated in the nuclear regions within @xmath9a few arcsec .",
    "although alma is a very powerful tool for unveiling the molecular gas distribution in detail , it is not sensitive to spatially extended structure beyond the maximum scale , which is @xmath16@xmath2 at @xmath1350 ghz in alma cycle 0 .",

    "we thus performed alma band 7 ( 275373 ghz ) observations of ngc 1614 to study the emission properties of hcn j = 43 , hco@xmath0 j = 43 , and hnc j = 43 lines .",

    "the net on - source exposure time for the hcn / hco@xmath0 j = 43 line observation of ngc 1614 was @xmath126 min .",
    "the frequency of the hnc j = 43 line ( @xmath21 = 362.630 ghz ) is separated from the hcn j = 43 and hco@xmath0 j = 43 lines , and we required independent observations .",
    "the hnc line was covered with one spectral window ( @xmath22 = 356.920 ghz ) , and an additional second spectral window was used to probe the continuum emission ( @xmath22 = 345.079 ghz ) .",
    "the net on - source exposure time for the hnc j = 43 line observation of ngc 1614 was @xmath125 min .",

    "the presence of hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc j = 43 lines were evident in the visibility plot , whereas signatures of other molecular lines were not clearly seen .",

    "we subtracted this continuum level and performed the task `` clean '' for molecular emission lines .",

    "continuum emission is found to be well subtracted in the spectra ( figure 2 right panels ) , and so the moment 0 maps in figure 2 ( left ) should reflect the properties of individual molecular gas emission lines .",
    "the peak flux , rms noise level , and synthesized beams in individual maps are summarized in table 4 ( row denoted `` all '' ) .",
    "the peak positions of hcn j = 43 and hco@xmath0 j = 43 agree with that of continuum `` a '' , whereas that of hnc j = 43 is two pixels ( 0.6@xmath2 ) displaced to the south from the continuum `` b '' peak .",

    "the dense molecular gas in the northern ( southern ) part of the nucleus is clearly redshifted ( blueshifted ) relative to the nuclear velocity of ngc 1614 ( v@xmath23 = 4800 [ km s@xmath18 ] for z = 0.016 ) .",

    "spectra within the beam size , at the nuclear position and the peak position of the red and blue components , are shown in figure 6 .",
    "as expected , spectra at the red ( blue ) component peaks are redshifted ( blueshifted ) , relative to those at the nuclear position for all the hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc j = 43 lines .",
    "gaussian fits were applied to the spectra .",
    "the resulting parameters are shown in table 5 ( rows denoted with `` peak '' , `` red '' , and `` blue '' ) .",
    "the line widths of these dense molecular gas tracers are generally larger in the blue component than the red component , which has also been seen in ionized gas @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the southern part of the nucleus is more turbulent than the northern part .",
    "figure 7 presents the position - velocity diagram along the north - south direction , passing through the nucleus .",
    "the channel map of the brightest hco@xmath0 j = 43 emission line is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the dense molecular gas in the northern region has greater velocity ( more redshifted ) than the southern molecular gas .",
    "the red and blue components of the dense molecular gas show emission peaks at @xmath10.6@xmath2 north and south of the nucleus , respectively , roughly corresponding to the northern and southern parts of the previously identified circumnuclear starburst ring with a radius of 0.51@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the spatial distribution of the 3.3 @xmath4 m pah emission feature , and found particularly strong pah emission at the northern and southern parts of the ring .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath4 m pah emission is a good indicator of starburst activity @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the pa@xmath14 ( 1.88 @xmath4 m ) emission , originating in hii regions , is strongest at the eastern and western sides of the circumnuclear starburst ring @xcite . how are these two kinds of starbursts related ?",
    "one scenario involves an age difference .",
    "the eastern and western starburst regions are probed with the tracers of hii regions where plenty of ionizing ( @xmath25 @xmath9 912 @xmath33 ) uv photons , usually dominated by short - lived massive o - stars , are needed . in contrast",
    ", the 3.3 @xmath4 m pah emission mostly comes from photo - dissociation regions between hii regions and molecular gas , where pahs are excited by non - ionizing ( @xmath25 @xmath3 912 @xmath33 ) stellar uv photons @xcite . for the pah - exciting non - ionizing uv continuum",
    ", the contribution from less massive stars than o stars is higher than that for ionizing uv photons inside hii regions .",
    "thus , the pah emission feature is sensitive not only to very young o - stars dominant starbursts but also to slightly aged starbursts where massive o - stars have mostly died , but less massive stars ( e.g. , b - stars ) still survive and emit a sufficient quantity of non - ionizing pah - exciting uv photons .",
    "@xcite showed that the 8.7 @xmath4 m infrared dust continuum , relative to the hii region tracer pa@xmath14 line ( 1.88 @xmath4 m ) , is enhanced at the northern and southern starburst ring . because non - ionizing uv continuum emission can contribute significantly to the infrared continuum emission but can not do so for the pa@xmath14 emission , the observed spatial variation in the 3.3 @xmath4 m pah to pa@xmath14 and 8.7 @xmath4 m to pa@xmath14 flux ratio is explainable under the scenario that the typical starburst age is older at the northern and southern ring than at the eastern and western ring @xcite . if the circumnuclear starburst ring is formed by nuclear starbursts that are progressing outward @xcite , the age difference in starbursts at different positions of the ring needs to be explained .",
    "dust extinction is another possibility because pa@xmath14 emission at 1.88 @xmath4 m can be more highly flux - attenuated than the 3.3 @xmath4 m pah emission and the 8.7 @xmath4 m dust continuum .",
    "radio free - free continuum emission from hii regions is less susceptible to foreground dust extinction and could help to determine whether pa@xmath14 emission is significantly affected by dust extinction .",
    "high - spatial - resolution radio continuum maps at 5 ghz ( 6 cm ) and 8.4 ghz ( 3.6 cm ) are available @xcite and @xcite ascribe the radio 5 ghz and 8.4 ghz emission in ngc 1614 to free - free emission from hii - regions in young starbursts .",
    "because the effects of free - free absorption inside hii regions are smaller at 8.4 ghz than at 5 ghz , the 8.4 ghz radio emission map is taken as the better probe of the true spatial distribution of hii regions .    in the radio 8.4 ghz map ,",
    "strong emission is detected in the eastern and western starburst ring @xcite , as seen in pa@xmath14 line map @xcite , confirming that luminous hii regions are present at those locations .",
    "however , at 8.4 ghz , bright emission is seen also at the northern starburst ring , where pa@xmath14 emission is not strong @xcite .",
    "similarly , when compared with the eastern starburst ring , the southern starburst ring is more conspicuous at 8.4 ghz than in pa@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the radio 8.4 ghz ( 3.6 cm ) and 1.88 @xmath4 m pa@xmath14 emission indicates that hii - regions at the northern and southern parts of the starburst ring , unveiled by the radio 8.4 ghz emission , are not sufficiently distinguished by pa@xmath14 emission .",
    "these northern and southern regions of the starburst ring are the locations where dense molecular gas is distributed , according to our alma data . given that dust coexists with dense molecular gas ,",
    "dust extinction is a natural explanation for the small pa@xmath14 to 8.4 ghz flux ratio at the northern and southern starburst rings .",
    "weak dust extinction is reported for starburst regions in ngc 1614 compared with other general starburst galaxies @xcite , based on near - infrared observations at @xmath25 @xmath9 2 @xmath4 m .",
    "this could be due partly to the fact that observations at @xmath25 @xmath9 2 @xmath4 m , including pa@xmath14 emission , selectively trace emission from less dusty starburst regions at the eastern and western ring and do not properly probe the dusty starbursts at the northern and southern parts of the ring due to flux attenuation by dust extinction .",
    "our alma data show that the high - density molecular gas in the northern part of the nucleus is redshifted and that gas in the southern part is blueshifted with respect to the nuclear velocity of this galaxy .",
    "this suggests the rotation of dense molecular gas along the east - west axis @xcite .",
    "a similar velocity pattern was found previously in the ionized gas maps @xcite and the lower density molecular gas probed with co j = 32 and j = 21 @xcite .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion is highest in the nuclear region with @xmath180 km s@xmath18 ( figure 4 ) , although it may be affected by the beam smearing of a rotating motion at the center .",
    "this value is similar to those measured through near - infrared spectroscopy @xcite and with ( sub)millimeter co j = 32 and co j = 21 emission lines @xcite .",
    "the rotational motion found in our moment 1 maps ( figure 4 ) can be used to derive the dynamical mass inside the rotating dense molecular gas disk .",
    "we used the hco@xmath0 j = 43 line because it is brighter than hcn j = 43 , and so the achieved s / n ratios are higher . in figure 4 , the rotational velocity is v @xmath1 100 km s@xmath18 at 1.52@xmath2 ( or r = 480640 pc at z = 0.016 ) from the nucleus .",
    "the derived dynamical mass within 1.52@xmath2 radius is m@xmath34 = rv@xmath35/g / sin(i)@xmath35 = 1.52.5 @xmath29 10@xmath5m@xmath6 , where the inclination angle i = 51@xmath36 is adopted @xcite . this mass is comparable to the previously estimated values @xcite .",
    "figure 9 is a plot of hcn - to - hco@xmath0 and hcn - to - hnc flux ratios at the j = 43 transition , derived from the spectra at the nucleus , red component peak position , blue component peak , and all regions with significant signal detection . in all data ,",
    "hcn j = 43 flux is smaller than that of hco@xmath0 j = 43 , but higher than hnc j = 43 flux .    using the j = 10 transitions of hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc , the possibility of distinguishing the hidden energy sources of merging lirg s dusty nuclei",
    "is suggested @xcite . in general , hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratios are small ( @xmath91 ) , and hcn - to - hnc flux ratios are large ( @xmath31 ) in starburst - dominated galaxies , whereas hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratios can be high ( @xmath31 ) in agns .",
    "agns could enhance hcn flux relative to hco@xmath0 , due possibly to hcn abundance enhancement by agn radiation @xcite and/or infrared radiative pumping of hcn @xcite .",
    "the low hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratios obtained in the starburst - dominated galaxy ngc 1614 at j = 43 are similar to other starburst galaxies at j = 10 . to obtain a physical interpretation of the observed j = 43 flux ratio , we need to know the excitation conditions .",
    "the hcn j = 10 flux of ngc 1614 was found to be 7.2 [ jy km s@xmath18 ] by @xcite based on single dish telescope observations . under thermal excitation , the hcn j = 43 flux is expected to be 16 times higher than j = 10 , and so @xmath1115 [ jy km s@xmath18 ] .",
    "our alma observations provide an observed hcn j = 43 flux from all signal - detected regions of 2.8 [ jy km s@xmath18 ] . the smaller flux of our alma data could partly be caused by missing flux , as our alma observations are insensitive to spatially extended emission with @xmath36@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimated that in ngc 1614 , the nuclear ( @xmath9several arcsec ) co j = 10 and j = 32 emission can account for @xmath330% and @xmath345% of the total flux measured with single - dish telescopes . because the hcn j = 43 line traces higher density molecular gas ( @xmath310@xmath37 @xmath11 ) than do co j = 10 and j = 32 lines and because higher - density gas is more concentrated in the nuclear region , our alma hcn j = 43 data should recover @xmath345% of the total flux . even assuming a missing flux of a factor of @xmath12 , the hcn j = 43 flux of ngc 1614 is 5.6 [ jy km s@xmath18 ] , only @xmath95% of the expected flux ( 115 jy km s@xmath18 ) for thermal excitation .",
    "thus , hcn j = 43 line is significantly sub - thermally excited in ngc 1614 , as observed in nearby galaxies at @xmath3100 pc scale @xcite .",
    "since the critical density of hcn j = 43 ( n@xmath38 @xmath1 2 @xmath29 10@xmath39 @xmath11 ) is higher than that of hco@xmath0 j = 43 ( n@xmath38 @xmath1 4 @xmath29 10@xmath37 @xmath11 ) @xcite , hco@xmath0 j = 43 is more easily excited than hcn j = 43 in starbursts . in an agn ,",
    "the emission surface brightness is higher than starburst activity , so the surrounding dust and gas are heated to a higher temperature , which may help to excite hcn j = 43 more than starburst activity .",
    "a high hcn - to - hco@xmath0 j = 43 flux ratio could be a good diagnostic of an agn , simply because of the high excitation of hcn j = 43 in an agn , even without an hcn - abundance enhancement @xcite .",
    "hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratios of known agn - important galaxies are being measured in our alma program ( imanishi et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and they tend to show higher hcn - to - hco@xmath0 j = 43 flux ratios than ngc 1614 , the template starburst galaxy ( see also imanishi et al . 2010a ; sakamoto et al . 2010 ; iono et al .",
    "since the j = 43 lines of hcn and hco@xmath0 are at higher frequencies ( shorter wavelengths ) than the lower j transition lines , the empirical energy diagnostic method , if established at j = 43 , is applicable to more distant merging lirgs using alma .",
    "this advantage is strengthened if hcn excitation is generally thermal up to the j = 43 transition in agn - important galaxies because hcn flux increases proportional to the square of frequency , partly compensating for the increase in earth s atmospheric background emission at higher - frequency alma bands .",
    "however , if the excitation at hcn j = 43 is sub - thermal , then hcn j = 32 or j = 21 lines may be better tracers of agn in terms of actually obtainable s / n ratios with alma . additional molecular line transition data at j = 32 and 21 for starburst - dominated galaxies and",
    "agn - important galaxies are needed ( 1 ) to distinguish whether high hcn - to - hco@xmath0 flux ratios at j = 43 in agn - important galaxies are due to hcn abundance enhancement and/or more hcn j = 43 excitation than starbursts and ( 2 ) to identify the j transition lines that are practically the best diagnostic for separating agns from starburst - dominated galaxies .",
    "we performed hcn , hco@xmath0 , and hnc j = 43 line observations of the well - studied starburst galaxy ngc 1614 to trace the properties of the high - density molecular gas .",
