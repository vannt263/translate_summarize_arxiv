    "for instance , large samples consisting of 100 minihalos may also include stars with up to @xmath7  m@xmath5 @xcite , while some halos with particularly high angular momentum or a large degree of turbulence may host stars with less than @xmath8  m@xmath5 @xcite . in more massive primordial halos exposed to strong radiation backgrounds , supermassive protostars with up to @xmath9  m@xmath5 may form @xcite .",
    "a low - mass star formation mode can be obtained during the merger of primordial minihalos , as shocks enhance the electron fraction and the formation of h@xmath10 and hd @xcite .",

    "the impact of cooling through metal lines and dust has also been explored in detailed one - zone models by @xcite and @xcite , while @xcite and @xcite have demonstrated the importance of h@xmath10 formation on dust grains , which can strongly influence the thermal evolution at metallicities of @xmath13  @xmath12 .",

    "the initial condition for the magnetic field is identical to @xcite , except for the normalization .",
    "the magnetic field has a power - law spectrum @xmath23 on large scales @xcite , peaks on a scale of @xmath24au , corresponding to 20 grid cells in our initial setup , and drops with @xmath25 on smaller scales .",

    "these values have been adopted in order to have a reference case corresponding to the absence of a magnetic field , as well as simulations which start already close to saturation , i.e. where turbulent and magnetic energies are comparable .",

    "the initial magnetic energy amounts to 45% ( 4% ) of the thermal energy , 11% ( 2% ) of the gravitational energy and 114% ( 10% ) of the kinetic energy of the halo .",
    "the simulations with @xmath29 g therefore represent an extreme case where the magnetic field has been maximally amplified .    since we want to follow all simulations to a similarly high density , the different temperatures at a given density for the various metallicities result in different sizes of the jeans length and jeans mass at the resolution limit .",

    "the figure shows that the magnetic field morphology and the formation of filaments by turbulence during the collapse depends critically on the thermodynamics . in agreement with our findings from more idealised simulations with a constant polytropic exponent @xcite",
    ", we observe a virialised , central core and tangled magnetic field vectors as long as the equation of state is super - isothermal , but notice strong shocks with sharp density contrasts and coherent magnetic field vectors on scales much larger than the jeans volume during isothermal or even sub - isothermal collapse phases .",
    "sub - isothermal collapse occurs in simulations with @xmath44 and @xmath45 at densities above @xmath46@xmath17 and @xmath47@xmath17 , respectively . the simulations with @xmath30 and @xmath48 are only slightly super - isothermal for @xmath49@xmath17 , and so the differences in the qualitative behaviour of the simulations becomes smaller as the collapse proceeds .",
    "figure [ fig : z0 ] shows density slices and magnetic field vectors for the three simulations with @xmath30 .",
    "the runs with @xmath50 behave similarly and are displayed in appendix  [ app : magden ] for the sake of completeness . in all cases ,",
    "sink particles form in disc - like , rotating structures at the densest parts of filamentary density enhancements .",
    "these flattened , rotationally supported structures are called pseudo - discs @xcite .",
    "their velocity fields can deviate significantly from keplerian profiles as a result of strong gravitational instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for @xmath51 ,",
    "these pseudo - discs appear to be more stable to fragmentation compared to the simulations with @xmath52 , where sink particle formation and shocks destroy the central , dense structure and sink particle formation proceeds along the forming filaments .",
    "we stress that in the following , we will use the term `` disc '' as abbreviation of `` rotationally - flattened structure '' .",
    "our discs should not be confused with thin discs , which are dominated by the gravity field of the star at the centre , and only gradually become unstable as more gas falls onto the disc and can not be transported inwards fast enough .",
    "we neither see coherently rotating velocity fields nor pronounced radial transport in these discs .",
    "we note that , since we scale the magnetic field vectors by @xmath53 with a reference density @xmath54 to visualise the magnetic field over several orders of magnitude in density , very long arrows can originate from areas with a density much lower than @xmath54 if the magnetic field is comparatively strong there .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath54 , larger arrows mean greater magnetic field amplification beyond pure flux freezing .",
    "gravoturbulent fragmentation at the sites of sink particle formation is so strong that a coherent disc magnetic field can not build up .",
    "the only exception are runs z0b3 and z0b2 , in which the most pronounced disc structures form .",
    "we have followed the evolution of these disks for roughly 5 and 10 orbital times , respectively . nevertheless , we found no evidence for magnetically - driven outflows in our simulations .",
    "this is probably because we would need to simulate more orbital times to allow a strong toroidal magnetic field to build up .",
    "it is obvious that the magnetic field reduces fragmentation and sink particle formation for all metallicities ( compare table  [ table : sim ] ) .",
    "the extreme case is run z0b2 , in which only a single fragment forms in the centre of the disc during the simulation run - time .",
    "hence , although our sink particles do not represent finished stars , we expect the magnetic fields to shift the primordial stellar mass spectrum towards higher masses , similarly to the situation in present - day star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "table  [ table : sim ] displays some basic statistical information about the sink particles that form in the different simulations .",

    "positive values of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 indicate support against gravitational collapse , whereas negative values mean that collapse is promoted . as a measure of the contribution to the ( positive or negative ) support against gravity",
    ", we use the ratio of these support functions and the gravitational compression rate @xmath67 .",
    "thus , we consider the quantities @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we compute @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 for all grid cells and then derive mass - weighted averages for 50 density bins .",

    "positive and negative values are plotted separately . especially in run z0b2 ,",
    "the presence of the magnetic field dramatically enhances not only the magnetic support function , but also the turbulent support function . in the simulations without magnetic fields , the strongest positive support is due to the thermal pressure , while turbulence provides a predominantly negative support due to compressive motions ( see similar results by @xcite and @xcite for a primordial collapse in the presence of strong radiative backgrounds ) .    in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the positive and negative contributions are nearly equal over a wide range of densities , with the exception of the highest densities . in contrast , @xcite find pronounced positive support by magnetic fields .",
    "however , there are important differences compared to the scenario we consider here .",
    "firstly , @xcite compute the support for turbulence produced by external forcing in a periodic box , where gravitational collapse is triggered by supersonic turbulent compressions of the gas .",
    "secondly , no sink particles are inserted in their simulations . as a result",
    ", the magnetic field is squeezed into collapsing gas of arbitrarily high density . in our simulations , on the other hand , the magnetic field is decoupled from the collapsing gas once sink particles are inserted .",
    "this limits somewhat the maximal magnetic pressure that can build up against gravity .",
    "thirdly , we expect our collapsing halo to have a stronger tendency to produce disc - like structures in comparison to turbulence produced by random forcing , which , averaged over the box , induces zero angular momentum",
    ". these rotating discs might affect the field morphology dramatically by winding up magnetic field lines and building up magnetic pressure .",
    "nevertheless , we see that the net magnetic support becomes positive at densities of @xmath74  g  @xmath17 , where a protostellar accretion disc has formed .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced in the simulation z0b2 , but also visible in z0b3 with a weaker magnetic field , as well as in the higher - metallicity simulations . within the disc ,",
    "the magnetic field therefore provides a stabilising contribution , as also reported by @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that the fragmentation timescale increases in the presence of a magnetic field , as supported by a more detailed analysis of the relevant timescales in the system ( section  [ sec : timan ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : jz ] displays the specific angular momentum @xmath75 at the time of first sink formation as a function of radius and enclosed mass for all simulations .",
    "the values shown are the mass - weighted averages over spherical shells centred on the densest grid cell in the domain",
    ". differences between the profiles are very small in general , so that even a magnetic field close to saturation does not seem to substantially impact the specific angular momentum profile .",
    "the magnetised halos have only a slightly larger @xmath75 in the inner @xmath16au .",
    "this behaviour is to be expected for the runs with @xmath30 , because here the disc structure , which is aligned approximately orthogonally to the @xmath76-axis of the simulation grid , becomes much more pronounced when the magnetic field increases , but for @xmath50 it is less clear from the density structures how an enhanced @xmath75 can be interpreted .",
    "the other components of the specific angular momentum vector , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , have more complicated , non - monotonic profiles , and show no strong trend with metallicity or magnetic field strength . in particular , both @xmath77 and @xmath78 change signs several times as a function of radius , so that the situation gets very difficult to visualise .    in their collapse simulations",
    ", @xcite find that magnetic braking transports angular momentum very efficiently and prevents the formation of a disc when @xmath79@xmath80 g , which is of a similar magnitude as our initial field strengths .",

    "the sink particles represent dense collapsing fragments of gas .",
    "such fragments are the very earliest stages of protostars as they have collapsed to high densities but have not yet started to contract to the main sequence .",

    "the extraordinary stability of the disc in run z0b2 is consistent with the unusually large support functions for this simulation ( compare figure  [ fig : lambdaz0b0 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we present a study assessing the relative impact of metals and magnetic fields during low - metallicity star formation . for this purpose , we consider metallicities ranging from the primordial case ( @xmath1 ) up to metallicities of @xmath98  @xmath12 . the magnetic field strength has been chosen such that the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the turbulent energy during the formation of the disc , as expected through the operation of the small - scale dynamo @xcite .",
    "we further pursue comparison runs with no magnetic fields to quantify their dynamical impact . in all cases , we follow the collapse until @xmath99  @xmath100 of gas are converted into sink particles .    in the runs without magnetic fields , we find that the primordial simulation provides the most stable configuration , where the fragmentation timescale @xmath90 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath0 compared to the higher - metallicity runs . for @xmath2 , however , we observe that @xmath90 depends only weakly on the actual metallicity .",

    "is still enhanced by a factor of @xmath3 , but fragmentation is no longer suppressed .",
    "we find , however , a similarity between primordial runs without magnetic fields , and low - metallicity runs with magnetic fields , which have comparable fragmentation timescales .",
    "these results are explored using the thermal , turbulent and magnetic support functions proposed by @xcite . in the absence of magnetic fields , the thermal pressure yields the dominant positive support for all metallicities explored here , while turbulence yields predominantly negative contributions due to the presence of compressible motions . on large scales where collapse has already occured",
    ", magnetic fields have comparable negative and positive contributions , while they act as a stabilising agent on the small scale of the protostellar disc .",
    "the latter explains why the fragmentation timescale increases in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "finally , we assess the impact of these processes on the sink particle mass functions .",
    "these sink particles represent collapsing fragments , not finished stars . at the time when we stop our simulation , i.e. when @xmath99  @xmath100 are converted into sinks , we compare the sink particle mass distribution in simulations of different metallicities and with and without magnetic fields . in the primordial run with a saturated magnetic field , only one single fragment forms , therefore indicating a potentially top - heavy sink mass function . with decreasing field strength , the number of sinks slightly increased , but remains reduced compared to the @xmath2 simulations . a shift towards larger sink masses",
    "is therefore expected in the primordial case , which is particularly pronounced in the presence of magnetic fields .    in the simulations with @xmath2 ,",
    "the sink mass function appears rather similar regardless of the actual value of @xmath34 or the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we note , however , that the number of sinks is somewhat reduced in all simulations with magnetic fields , and there is a weak trend indicating the formation of slightly more massive sinks . in order to more strongly constrain the potential influence of metallicity and magnetic fields on the stellar initial mass function ( imf )",
    ", we would need to follow the simulations until a larger number of sinks has formed , therefore improving the statistics for assessing the imf .",

    "in particular , the data for our barotropic equation of state was extracted from the simulations of @xcite before a disc was formed , which probably results in an overestimate of the temperature and too stable discs . on the other hand ,",
    "our equation of state does not include stellar feedback , which would heat the disc by an unknown amount , stabilising the disc again . which of these two competing processes dominates is at present unclear .",

    "<S> low - metallicity star formation poses a central problem of cosmology , as it determines the characteristic mass scale and distribution for the first and second generations of stars forming in our universe . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a comprehensive investigation assessing the relative impact of metals and magnetic fields , which may both be present during low - metallicity star formation . we show that the presence of magnetic fields generated via the small - scale dynamo stabilises the protostellar disc and provides some degree of support against fragmentation . in the absence of magnetic fields , the fragmentation timescale in our model decreases by a factor of @xmath0 at the transition from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , with subsequently only a weak dependence on metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the accretion timescale of the cluster is set by the large - scale dynamics rather than the local thermodynamics . in the presence of magnetic fields , </S>",
    "<S> the primordial disc can become completely stable , therefore forming only one central fragment . at @xmath2 , the number of fragments is somewhat reduced in the presence of magnetic fields , though the shape of the mass spectrum is not strongly affected in the limits of the statistical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the fragmentation timescale , however , increases by roughly a factor of @xmath3 in the presence of magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our results indicate comparable fragmentation timescales in primordial runs without magnetic fields and @xmath2 runs with magnetic fields . </S>"
