    "( 1993 ) have begun a pioneering search for lensing events of unresolved stars in m31 by monitoring individual _ pixels _ for the time - dependent flux induced by one of the many unresolved stars they contain :   ` pixel lensing ' for short . for a classical lensing event ,",
    "the light curve is obtained by subtracting the reference flux , @xmath3 , from the amplified flux , @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the flux of the lensed star before or after the event and @xmath7 is the residual flux from stars that are not participating in the event .",
    "here the amplification is @xmath8^{1/2 } , \\eqno(1.2)\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the inverse einstein ring crossing time , @xmath10 is the dimensionless impact parameter , and @xmath11 is the time at the maximum amplification . in an uncrowded field where the blending of stars is not important ( @xmath12 ) , one can directly measure the values of @xmath4 and @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is impossible to measure the absolute values of @xmath4 and @xmath3 for the case of pixel lensing since stars can not be resolved .",
    "however , the light curve , @xmath14 , can still be obtained by subtracting the reference image from those in which a lensing event is in progress ( ciardullo et al .",
    "1990 ; tomaney & crotts 1996 ) .",
    "pixel lensing has several advantages over classical lensing .",
    "first of all , one is not restricted to observing fields where stars are resolvable .",
    "second , one can detect @xmath15 events from a season - long observation of m31 in a single field with moderate resources because a large number of stars are monitored ( han 1996 ) .",
    "finally , one looks through the galactic halo when an external galaxy is monitored for pixel lensing ; some fraction of events may be caused by the galactic massive compact halo objects ( machos ) .",
    "if the galactic machos can be distinguished from events caused by the lenses in the external galaxy , pixel lensing will considerably increase the number of galactic macho events .",
    "in addition to the increase in the number of events , one can use the data toward these additional lines of sight to constrain the shape of the galactic halo .",
    "however , events caused by one population are just contaminants in the study of the other population unless they are separated .",
    "the problem becomes more serious when the fraction of contaminating events is large .",
    "it is therefore important to determine the fraction of events caused by each population and to develop methods for distinguishing them from one another .",
    "we estimate that @xmath0 of total events seen toward the m31 bulge area are caused by the galactic halo machos , assuming an all - macho halo .",
    "the first and second year of data observed by the macho group toward the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) gives tentative support to the hypothesis that machos constitute a significant fraction of the galactic halo ( d.  bennett 1995 , private communication ) .",
    "we test various observables for their ability to distinguish the galactic halo events from m31 events .",
    "we find that most high maximum - flux galactic halo events can be isolated through a satellite - based measurement of the flux difference caused by the parallax effect .",
    "this observational strategy is discussed in   4.1 .",
    "proper motion can be measured for @xmath2 of high signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath16 ) m31 events and can also be used to separate galactic halo / m31 events .",
    "in addition , 1% of galactic events can be isolated by determining the lower limit of the proper motion , @xmath17 .",
    "hence , only a small fraction of events can be separated by using the proper motion and proper motion - limit measurements .",
    "the mean optical depth to an m31 star lensed by the galactic halo machos is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distance to m31 , and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the distances between the observer , source , and the lens . for the distribution of matter in the galactic halo ,",
    "we adopt a modified isothermal sphere with a core radius @xmath24 ; @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the distance measured from the galactic center to a macho , the normalization is @xmath27 , the core radius is @xmath28 ( bahcall , schmidt , & soneira 1983 ) , and @xmath29 is the solar galactocentric distance .",
    "the galactic halo model is the same as that adoted by griest ( 1991 ) for his computation of the optical depth toward the lmc except that the halo extends out to @xmath30 , and thus results in higher @xmath31 .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is quite uncertain , but it hardly affects the optical depth determination because m31 is located @xmath32 away from the galactic center . from equations ( 2.1.1 ) and ( 2.1.2 ) , one finds the optical depth contribution by the galactic halo machos to be @xmath33 .    for the m31 halo , we adopt a standard isothermal model with a core radius of the form @xmath34 because it is known that the rotation curve is flat at large radii up to @xmath35 from the m31 center with a rotation velocity of @xmath36 ( kent 1989a ) . the core radius is determined from the relation @xmath37 resulting in @xmath38 with the total mass of the luminous components taken to be @xmath39 , where the total masses of the m31 bulge and disk are determined below . with this density model , the optical depth contributed by m31 halo lenses is computed similarly to equation ( 2.1.1 ) , resulting in @xmath40 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the optical depth along a given line of sight caused by m31 disk+bulge events is computed by @xmath41^{-1 } , \\eqno(2.1.5)\\ ] ] because theses populations work both as lenses and sources ( self - lensing ) .",
    "here @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the m31 disk and bulge densities , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the lower and upper boundaries of mass distribution along the line of sight .",
    "we model the m31 bulge as an oblate spheroid with its ( unnormalized ) matter density as a function of semimajor axis provided by kent ( 1989b ) .",
    "the best - fitting value of axis ratio , @xmath47 , is found by fitting the computed surface brightness ( including extinction ) to a @xmath48-band image of m31 bulge ( han 1996 ) . in the central region where the m31 bulge mass dominates , the rotation velocity is @xmath49 .",
    "we thus normalize the total m31 bulge mass within @xmath50 kpc by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the adopted rotation speed of the galaxy and galactic bulge mass within @xmath50 kpc ( zhao , spergel , & rich 1995 ) .",
    "this normalization procedure results in @xmath54 , which is in a reasonable agreement with the determined value of @xmath55 by kent ( 1989b ) .",
    "the m31 bulge is cut off at @xmath56 .",
    "the m31 disk is modeled by the double exponential disk , i.e. , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the normalization , and the radial and vertical scale heights are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively ( gould 1994c ) .",
    "this results in @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting total optical depth distribution caused by m31 population is shown as a contour map in figure 1 for various lines of sights .",
    "the projected position @xmath62 is defined relative to the major and minor axes of the m31 bulge isophotes .",
    "we note that the determined optical depth is subject to many uncertainties .",
    "the main uncertainty comes from the density distribution of lenses and sources .",
    "for example , braun ( 1991 ) has argued that there is no need to invoke a massive dark halo component . instead of a halo ,",
    "his model has higher disk and bulge densities , c.f . ,",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 within 30 kpc from the center .",
    "pixel lensing experiments may resolve the conflicts in the matter density distribution in m31 from the comparison between the theoretical predictions and future observational result .",
    "now we estimate the fraction of events caused by machos in the galactic halo when a pixel lensing search is carried out toward the m31 bulge from the ground .",
    "the event rate per angular area @xmath65 is determined by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the luminosity function ( lf ) of the source stars ( see   3 ) and @xmath68 is the surface brightness in the m31 bulge area ( see han 1996 for detailed formalism and the surface brightness distribution ) . here",
    "the maximum impact parameter , @xmath69 , within which a lensing event with a source star of luminosity @xmath70 can be detected for a certain required signal to noise ratio , @xmath71 , is obtained from the equation @xmath72",
    "\\over \\beta_{\\rm max } } = \\left ( { \\sigma \\omega_{\\rm psf } \\bar{\\omega } \\over \\pi f_{0}^{2 } \\alpha } \\right ) ( s / n)^2_{\\rm min } \\eta , \\eqno(2.2.2)\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the mean photon detection rate averaged over the duty cycle of the telescope , @xmath74 ( see below ) , @xmath75 is the inverse value of the median einstein time scale , and @xmath76 is the angular area of the point spread function ( psf ) of the source star with a seeing @xmath77 .",
    "the values of @xmath78 are given in figure 1 of gould ( 1996 ) .",
    "the signal suffers from additional noise due to the sky brightness and the time variation of the psf by a factor @xmath79 @xmath80 where the sky brightness is taken to be @xmath81 in @xmath82 band , @xmath83 is the seeing difference between an image and the reference frame , and @xmath84 is the rate of photon detection at the fluctuation magitude of m31 , i.e. , @xmath85 ( tonry 1991 ) .",
    "the event rate , @xmath86 , depends on the observational strategy . here",
    "the event rate is determined under the following observational conditions .",
    "event rates for various other strategies are discussed in detail by han ( 1996 ) .",
    "we assume the experiment employs a @xmath87 ccd array with a pixel size of @xmath88 on a 1-m telescope .",
    "the observation is carried out in @xmath82 band , and the camera can detect @xmath89 for an @xmath90 star .",
    "the observation is carried out for an average @xmath91 per night during the m31 season , which is @xmath92 of a year .",
    "the fractional seeing difference is kept to @xmath93 and each image is obtained by subdividing the exposure time to prevent saturation of pixels . in the computation ,",
    "the sub - integration time is @xmath1 , and thus @xmath94 .",
    "the images taken every day are _ combined _ together , and thus @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the photon detection rate of the camera .    for the computation of event rate",
    ", it is required to compute the median time scale @xmath97 [ see equation ( 2.2.2 ) ] .",
    "the value of @xmath98 depends on the geometry , the mass function , and the transverse velocity of the lens system .",
    "the velocity distribution is modeled by a gaussian with one - dismensional dispersion , @xmath99 .",
    "the galactic macho velocity distribution has @xmath100 . to account for the solar motion around the galactic center",
    ", we increase the dispersion by @xmath101 . by incresing the galactic halo lens speed , one can simplfy the observer s motion to be @xmath102 .",
    "the m31 halo lens has @xmath103 , while the disk and bulge are modeled by @xmath104 , based on the measured value by lawrei ( 1983 ) . with these adopted values of velocity dispersions",
    "the transverse velocity is determined by @xmath105 .",
    "\\eqno(2.2.4)\\ ] ] where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 are the velocity of the source , lens , and observer , respectively . for galactic halo events , one can approximate @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "similarily , @xmath111 and @xmath112 for m31 halo and m31 disk+bulge self - lensing events .",
    "the values of @xmath99 of the transverse speed distributions for events of individual populations are listed in table 1 .",
    "the resultant speed distributions of both m31 halo and disk+bulge events are similar , so we use a common distribution of @xmath113 .    with the transverse speed distribution models , the time scale distribution of self lensing events ( m31 disk+bulge events ) for a constant mass , e.g. , @xmath114 , is then obtained by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the dirac delta function . for the galactic and m31 halo events",
    ", the time scale distribution can be approximated by @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 for galactic halo events while @xmath120 and @xmath121 for m31 halo events .",
    "the additional factors @xmath122 and @xmath123 are included to weight events by their cross section @xmath124 and transverse speed . then the true time scale distribution is obtained by convolving @xmath125 with the lens mass function @xmath126 ; @xmath127 here once again the factor @xmath128 is included to weight by @xmath129 . for the mass of galactic and m31 halo machos , we adopt @xmath130 , which is the upper mass limit of hydrogen burning . note that @xmath131 for other masses .",
    "however , the majority of m31 disk+bulge events are expected to be caused by low mass stars , and thus we adopt a mass spectrum of local galactic stars obtained from hst data ( gould , bahcall , & flynn 1996 ) for m31 disk+bulge lenses .",
    "the mass spectrum is shown in figure 2 of han & gould ( 1996 ) . to compare the time scale distributions for events from individual populations , we present @xmath132 for events at the position @xmath133 as representative distributions in figure 2 .",
    "note that @xmath132 for m31 disk+bulge events depends on the field of observation ; shorter @xmath134 toward the center because the average separation between lenses and sources @xmath135 decreases .",
    "events from the three populations have very similar distributions with @xmath136 and so the time scale can not be used as a tool for the separation of events into different populations .",
    "finally , the total event rate is then found by @xmath137 where the total angular area of the ccd is @xmath138 , which is equivalent to @xmath139 .",
    "the event rate for each population as a function of @xmath71 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the m31 disk+bulge and m31 halo events have a similar event rates , while galactic halo events are @xmath140 times less frequent than events from either of the m31 populations , i.e. , galactic halo events constitute @xmath0 of the total .",
    "the fraction of galactic halo events will increase by choosing a filed that is located away from the m31 bulge . as the field is further away from the m31 center ,",
    "the optical depth for the galactic halo events is virtually the same , but the source star number , @xmath141 , and thus the total number of events , @xmath142 , significantly decreases because @xmath143 .",
    "for example , the number of source stars in the field at @xmath144 is a factor @xmath145 larger than that of the field at @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , it would not be a good idea choosing a field too far away from the m31 bulge just to increase halo / m31 event ratio .",
    "now we return to the main concern of the article ; what kind of information can one obtain from observables of individual events ? to answer this question , we carry out a monte carlo simulation of lensing events toward the m31 bulge .",
    "the following are the distributions from which lensing parameters are drawn ; @xmath147 , &   halo , \\cr \\int dd_{\\rm os } \\rho(d_{\\rm os } ) \\int dd_{\\rm ol } \\rho(d_{\\rm ol})d^{1/2 } \\delta \\left [ r_{\\rm e}-\\left ( { 4gm\\over c^2 } { d_{\\rm ol}d_{\\rm ls } \\over d_{\\rm os } } \\right)^{1/2 } \\right ] , &   m31 , \\cr } &   \\cr g_{\\beta}(\\beta ) = [ 0,\\beta_{\\rm max } ] , &    \\cr } \\eqno(3.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath148 $ ] represents a uniform distribution in the range @xmath149 .",
    "the source star lf is based primarily on the lf of galactic bulge stars determined by j.  frogel ( 1995 , private communication ) .",
    "however , this determination is incomplete at the faint end ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "if it were adopted without correction , the fraction of luminous stars would be overestimated .",
    "the net effect would then be the overestimation of the event rate because events are more likely to be detected for luminous stars .",
    "we model the faint part of the lf by adopting the lf of stars in the solar neighborhood determined by wielen , jahreiss , & krger ( 1983 ) for @xmath151 and by gould , bahcall , & flynn ( 1996 ) for @xmath152 . the corrected model lf yields a fluctuation magnitude of @xmath153 , which matches well with tonry s ( 1991 ) determination of @xmath154 before the extinction correction .",
    "the fraction of light from the stars in the corrected part of the lf is @xmath155 , which is not negligible .",
    "the lfs before ( _ thin _ line ) and after the model correction ( _ thick _ line ) are shown in the first panel of figure 5 .",
    "for each luminosity , the value of @xmath156 is obtained from equation ( 2.2.2 ) .",
    "detectable events are those that satisfy the condition @xmath157 . in addition",
    ", events must satisfy the following two conditions .",
    "the first one is that the effective duration of an event , @xmath158 , must be long enough for the reasonable construction of light curve , i.e. , @xmath159 .",
    "second , the angular size of the source star must be smaller than the angullar einstein ring size , i.e. , @xmath160 , to avoid the maximum flux suppression due to the finite size source effect ( nemiroff & wickramashinghe 1994 ; witt & mao 1994 ; gould 1994a ; simmons , newsam , & willis 1995 ) .",
    "both galactic and m31 halo events have very similar physical parameters .",
    "they have same masses ( @xmath161 ) and similar transverse speeds ( @xmath162 versus @xmath163 ) .",
    "in addition , due to the equivalence between @xmath22 for galactic lenses to @xmath23 of m31 halo events , vice versa , both population events have very similar time scales , as already shown in figure 2 , and einstein ring sizes , @xmath164 .",
    "separating galactic halo / m31 events is important for the better understanding of the global properties of the galactic halo such as its flattening . because galactic halo events account for only @xmath0 of the total , it is possible to use observations toward m31 to constrain the galactic halo only if the halo events can be identified .",
    "sackett & gould ( 1993 ) have proposed that one can constrain the shape of the galactic halo by studying the optical depths toward lmc and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) . to understand the role of m31 in determining the shape of the halo , we write the galactic coordinates of the smc , lmc , and m31 as @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "thus , the lines of sight toward smc , lmc , and m31 are progressively closer to the galactic plane and further from the galactic center .",
    "this implies that by adding the line of sight to m31 , one increases the leverage on the shape of the galactic halo relative to observing the lmc and smc alone",
    ".    additionally , halo events are contaminants for the study of machos in m31 . if the galactic halo is flattened ( dubinski & calberg 1991 ; katz 1991 ; sackett & sparke 1990 ) , the contamination of events toward m31 by the galactic halo events would be more significant than our estimate . if one can separate a",
    "_ large _ fraction of m31 events from the galactic halo events , a better study about the nature of m31 machos will be possible . in this section , we investigate the methods and required observables that can be used to isolate the two populations .",
    "we begin with a brief discussion of the general observables in pixel lensing . near the peak of a light curve ,",
    "the flux is approximated by @xmath168^{1/2 } } ; \\",
    "\\ f_{\\rm max } = { f_0 \\over \\beta},\\ \\ t_{\\rm eff } = \\beta t_{\\rm e } , \\eqno(4.1)\\ ] ] since @xmath169 and @xmath170^{1/2}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath171 is the flux at the maximum amplification .",
    "the values of @xmath171 and @xmath172 are _ directly _ measurable for individual moderately high amplification events .",
    "the distributions of @xmath172 and @xmath171 are determined for events with @xmath173 and @xmath174 by the monte carlo simulation and are shown in figure 4 . since we already know that galactic and m31 halo events have similar physical paramaters , and so similar for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , we show only distributons of galactic halo and m31 disk+bulge events .",
    "we present their distributions at the representative positions of the m31 bulge area at @xmath175 ( _ thick _ line ) and @xmath176 ( _ thin _ line ) .",
    "the distributions for the galactic ( and m31 ) halo and m31 disk+bulge self - lensing events are similar to each other , and thus neither quantity can be directly used for the separation of individual populations .",
    "although @xmath134 can be measured for some of the high @xmath16 ( @xmath177 ) events , it is not in general a direct observable .",
    "however , one can infer @xmath134 from @xmath172 and @xmath171 provided that the color of the source star is known .",
    "the color of a source star can still be measured from the maximum flux since @xmath178 and the event is achromatic .",
    "the approximate value of the luminosity , @xmath179 , can then be determined using a color - mag relation .",
    "however , there can be different types of stars with the same color , e.g. , lower main sequence stars and giants .",
    "therefore , there will be a two - fold degeneracy in determining @xmath179 for low @xmath16 events . for high @xmath16 events , @xmath134 ( and so @xmath180 ) can be approximately determined from the light curve , thereby breaking the degeneracy and allowing unambiguous determination of @xmath179 from the color .",
    "fortunately , the stellar population expected to be detected at low @xmath16 are nearly all main sequence stars , so it should be possible to determine @xmath134 in nearly all cases . in figure 5 , we plot the lf of source stars ( before amplification ) for the expected events with different values of threshold @xmath16 ; @xmath181 and @xmath182 in the second and third panels , respectively . at lower @xmath71 ,",
    "most detectable events are from main - sequence stars . as the @xmath71 increases",
    ", a significant fraction of events comes from upper main - sequence and clump giant stars . as shown in figure 2 , however , @xmath134 is not useful for separating halo / m31 events , either .",
    "two other quantities can be measured under special circumstances : the displacement of the source star in the einstein ring due to parallax effect and the proper motion of the lens , @xmath183 .",
    "one of the tools for the separation of both galactic halo / m31 events is provided by the parallax effect .",
    "the principle is simple .",
    "by observing an event at two different positions , one from the ground and the other from a heliocentric satellite , the light curves display a displacement in the einstein ring , @xmath184 ( refsdal 1966 ; gould 1994b ) .",
    "then the flux measured from the ground will be different from that measured from the satellite for the galactic halo events because the ground - based photometry is carried out when the event is near the maximum amplification , while the flux measured from the satellite , @xmath185 , is not .",
    "however , the flux difference due to parallax effect will be extremely small for m31 self - lensing events due to their negligible amount of parallax @xmath186 $ ] .",
    "therefore , when the difference between the fluxes , @xmath187 , from ground and satellite - based photometry is detected , the event is almost certainly caused by a galactic halo macho .",
    "it will be difficult to precisely measure @xmath184 ; the signal - to - noise ratio will be low and a typical event lasts only @xmath188 , which is too short for the construction of detailed light curve . however , measurement of @xmath187 will still be feasible , and this by itself allows the galactic events to be recognized .",
    "now , we answer the question : what fraction of galactic halo events can be distinguished in this way ?",
    "for this determination , we assume that the satellite photometry will be carried out with a camera on a 0.5 m telescope mounted on a heliocentric satellite .",
    "the ccd camera is exposed for @xmath189 and can detect @xmath190 for an @xmath90 mag star .",
    "we assume that the seeing is slightly larger than the diffraction limit : @xmath191 .",
    "the background surface brightness varies in the range @xmath192 in most of the m31 bulge area except for the part very close to the central region .",
    "the read - out noise is assumed to be negligible .",
    "then the signal to noise ratio from the satellite observation is computed by @xmath193 where @xmath185 is the measured flux from the satellite , the background flux is @xmath194 , and @xmath195 is the flux for @xmath196 .",
    "the flux difference due to parallax is computed as follows .",
    "the earth - satellite separation vector projected onto the lens plane is @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the 3-dimensional earth - satellite vector and @xmath199 is the unit vector toward m31 from the sun . in scalar form , the separation is given by @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the ecliptic latitude of m31 and @xmath202 is the phase of the orbit ( gould 1995 ) . during an m31 season",
    ", @xmath202 varies in the range @xmath203 . the amount of displacement in einstein ring due to the parallax is then calculated by @xmath204 where the projected einstein radius is @xmath205 . for galactic halo events , @xmath206 since @xmath207 .",
    "the angle @xmath208 varies in the range @xmath209 $ ] , i.e. , random orientation , and the distribution of @xmath210 is obtained from equation ( 3.1 ) . then the flux difference is computed by @xmath211 f_0 . \\eqno(4.1.4)\\ ] ]    in table 2 , we present the numbers , @xmath212 , and fractions , @xmath213 , of galactic halo events that can be separated from m31 events by measuring @xmath187 for various values of @xmath171 . both values are determined under the criteria of @xmath214 and @xmath215 ( i.e. , 3 and 5 @xmath99 levels ) .",
    "the numbers of events due to the galactic halo , @xmath216 , and due to all populations ( m31 halo , disk+bulge , and galactic halo ) , @xmath142 , are those that can be detected with @xmath217 from ground observations . for event with @xmath218 , nearly all galactic halo events can be separated , while the fraction decreases significantly for low @xmath171 events because the stars are too faint to be seen .",
    "( to avoid confusion , we note that these faint events can still be detected from the ground because the image combination process yields a higher @xmath16 . )",
    "therefore , the best target for @xmath187 measurement would be high @xmath171 events .",
    "since the photometry can be done with a relatively short exposure time , @xmath219 , it can be carried out as a part of a larger project whose principal mission is parallax measurements of events toward the galactic bulge and lmc .",
    "proper motion of machos can also be used for the separation of galactic halo / m31 events . for a classical lensing event",
    "in which a macho passes over or very close to the face of a star , the part of the star closer to the lens is amplified more than other parts because the source star is not a perfect point source : differential amplification . by measuring the amount of deviation of the light curve from that of point source , one can measure the ratio @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the angular size of the source . since @xmath222 can be determined from the measured color ( and stefan s law )",
    ", one can uniquely determine the @xmath223 and the proper motion of the macho , @xmath224 ( gould 1994a ) .",
    "for pixel lensing events in which the lens transits the source , it is also possible to measure the proper motion .",
    "however , the process is somewhat different from that in classical lensing .",
    "the source can not be resolved , so it is impossible to determine @xmath222 from stefan s law .",

    "generally , it is also not possible to measure @xmath134 .",
    "however , from the deviation of light curve from its point source form , one can determine @xmath226 , which is the time it takes for the lens to cross the stellar radius . the proper motion is then given by @xmath227 .",
    "once @xmath183 is measured , one can easily distinguish halo / m31 events because the values of @xmath183 are quite different for the galactic halo and m31 events . however , the fraction of events for which proper motions can be measured is small . for m31 disk+bulge self - lensing events with @xmath228 ,",
    "the fraction is @xmath2 and similar to m31 halo events .",
    "since the fraction scales inversely with @xmath223 , the galactic fraction is smaller by a factor @xmath229 , and is therefore completely negligible .    in the more usual case when the lens does not transit the source star @xmath230",
    ", one can still set the lower limit of the proper motion of individual events by @xmath231 then a galactic halo event can be isolated whenever @xmath17 is too high to be consistent with m31 self - lensing .",
    "we determine the fraction of galactic halo events that can be isolated in this way by setting the upper limit of the m31 lens population at @xmath232 .",
    "unfortunately , only @xmath233 of galactic halo events can be isolated using proper motion lower limits .",
