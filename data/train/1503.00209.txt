    "devices that violate reciprocity , the symmetry that exists upon exchange of source and observer , are of great practical and theoretical importance .",
    "they allow , for example , the control of information flow in signal processing applications @xcite and violations of detailed balance@xcite . in the microwave domain ,",
    "two ubiquitous and vital directional elements are the matched directional amplifier and the circulator @xcite .",
    "these elements generally function by very different underlying physical phenomena .",
    "amplifiers are typically made with transistors which use the field effect of a metallic gate on a semiconducting channel to unidirectionally increase the power of a weak input signal ( fig .",
    "on the other hand , microwave circulators usually operate by the interference of multiple paths through a magnetically biased ferrite ring which produces non - reciprocal phase shifts ( fig .",
    "both these elements are widely used for the processing of microwave signals in superconducting qubit experiments @xcite",
    ". however , commercially available devices are not ideal for quantum information applications since they suffer from losses , and associated added noise , which harms the quantum properties of flying microwave photons @xcite .",
    "additionally , the required strong magnetic fields prevent easy on - chip integration of circulators with superconducting qubits .",
    "the rather distinct physical phenomena underlying current commercial implementations of circulators and amplifiers would suggest that these directional devices must be improved by completely different means .    here , we demonstrate that both kinds of non - reciprocal functions can be produced in the same device in a dispersive manner via the interference of parametric couplings between multiple resonant structures ( fig .",
    "previously , several circulator designs without magnetic elements have been proposed @xcite , tailored for superconducting qubit experiments .",
    "an rf - frequency circulator with only semiconducting parts has also been recently demonstrated experimentally @xcite , but using lossy components .",
    "the proposed designs specific to superconducting qubit experiments are all based on parametrically pumping a distributed nonlinearity with several rf - sources to produce unity - gain photon conversion between the ports of the device .",
    "these parametric couplings can in fact produce photon number gain as well .",
    "the interference of this gain process with unity - gain photon conversion has been discussed in several recent theory proposals @xcite as a means to realize directional amplification . in particular , the authors of ref .",
    "have developed a remarkable graph - theoretical scheme to predict the minimal non - reciprocal circuit satisfying a given set of constraints . in this work",
    "we experimentally realize a directional amplifier based on this principle , suitable for quantum information purposes .",
    "we further show that via a simple change in pump conditions , we can switch the device into a purely dispersive , ferrite - free microwave circulator which is truly minimal , unlike previous proposals . in the process",
    "we demonstrate the deep physical connection between these two seemingly distinct directional elements .",
    "our device is realized by parametrically pumping the three wave mixing non - linearity of a josephson parametric converter ( jpc ) @xcite .",
    "the heart of the jpc is the josephson ring modulator ( jrm ) , a ring of four josephson junctions , which couples to three orthogonal circuit modes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 shown schematically in fig .",
    "the jrm is embedded at the central current antinodes of two crossed @xmath3-resonators , which constitute modes  and , with frequencies @xmath4  ghz , @xmath5  ghz .",
    "these resonators are accessible by `` ports '' , i.e.   semi - infinite transmission lines giving the modes finite energy decay rates @xmath6  mhz , @xmath7  mhz respectively . the third microwave mode , with frequency @xmath8  ghz , is formed by the common - mode excitation of the jrm , and has an energy decay rate @xmath9  mhz . on applying a flux through the jrm close to half a flux quantum ,",
    "a tri - linear three - body interaction between these three orthogonal modes of the form @xmath10 becomes the leading non - linear term in the system hamiltonian@xcite . here , , and  are the annihilation operators for their respective modes , and @xmath11 is the flux - dependent tri - linear coupling strength .",
    "by off - resonantly driving one mode with a cw tone of the appropriate frequency , we can produce one of two kinds of two - body interactions between the other two modes as discussed below .",
    "the first kind of 2-body interaction is a photon gain process , yielding the conventional non - directional phase - preserving amplification which has been widely used previously @xcite .",
    "this process is achieved by pumping one spatial mode ( e.g.  ) at the sum frequency of the other two ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "provided the pump frequency is sufficiently detuned from any harmonic of the -mode , the pump can be approximated as a classical drive and the interaction hamiltonian reduces to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the pump - power - dependent coupling strength , and @xmath15 is the pump phase , referred to a common clock used for all cw tones .",
    "the gain of the resulting amplification process at zero detuning can be written as @xmath16 .",
    "classically , as @xmath17 , the small signal gain can become arbitrarily large .",
    "this process , denoted graphically as ` @xmath18 ' , bi - directionally connects two modes , up to a phase factor , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "we also give a graphical representation of the scattering matrix in fig .",
    "signals entering through one port are amplified in reflection with voltage gain @xmath19 , and in transmission with gain @xmath20 , together with frequency translation and a pump - phase dependent non - reciprocal phase shift @xmath15 .",
    "phase conjugation is also taking place in the frequency conversion process , as indicated by a white ( rather than black ) arrowhead . a signal incident on one mode",
    "will be combined with amplified vacuum - fluctuations from the other mode , achieving phase - preserving amplification .",
    "due to the symmetry of the amplification process , the signal can be collected from either output port .",
    "the second form of 2-body interaction we employ is a unity - gain photon conversion process @xcite.to demonstrate that any pair of modes can support either two - body interaction , here we chose to couple modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is achieved by pumping the third mode @xmath2 at the difference frequency of the other two ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "again , provided the pump frequency is sufficiently detuned from any mode , the interaction hamiltonian reduces to @xmath22 .",
    "the process is characterized by the conversion coefficient at zero detuning @xmath23 , ranging from 0 ( no - conversion ) to 1 ( full - conversion when @xmath24)@xcite .",
    "the process schematic is shown in fig .",
    "2c , together with a graphical representation of the scattering matrix .",
    "signals incident on either mode are either reflected with coefficient @xmath25 ) , or transmitted with coefficient @xmath26 . as in the gain process , signals transmitted through the device experience frequency translation and a pump - phase dependent non - reciprocal shift ( note that here all arrowheads are black , as no phase conjugation occurs ) . at the full conversion working point ,",
    "@xmath27 , the device resembles a gyrator@xcite but with the complication that it also performs a frequency translation .    as shown in fig .",
    "2d , the three modes of the jpc can be connected with up to six simultaneous gain and conversion processes .",
    "a particular function can be realized by identifying the appropriate pumping configuration .",
    "here , we will focus on configurations based only on one process per pair of modes , calculating the scattering matrices following the method of ref . .",
    "we first consider the case of three simultaneous unity - gain photon conversion processes , which produces a circulator .",
    "a schematic for the device coupling configuration and a graphical representation of the scattering matrix are shown in fig .  3a . in the ideal case ,",
    "the circulator uses three conversion processes , which would each individually achieve full conversion .",
    "the final important control variable is the algebraic sum of the three pump phases ( @xmath28 ) . constructive or destructive interference occurs as signals travel around the device , their phase being controlled by @xmath29 , which acts here as an artificial gauge flux , and plays the role of the magnetic field in a conventional circulator . as shown in fig .",
    "3b , for @xmath30 , a matched circulator with clockwise / counter - clockwise circulation is created .",
    "we note that this circulator is somewhat different from a ferrite - based circulator in that it translates the frequencies of signals passing through it , but this is generally not detrimental as we can freely shift the carrier frequency of our microwave signals without degrading their information content . as a matter of fact , frequency translation is beneficial in amplification chains when unwanted feedback needs to be suppressed .",
    "directional amplification is achieved by combining two gain processes and one conversion process , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "in the ideal case , we set the pairwise processes so that we have two equal gains @xmath18 and one full conversion ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "again , the interference within the device is controlled by a total pump phase @xmath31 , here now given by @xmath32 , with directional amplification occurring at @xmath33 .",
    "unlike the circulator , this schematic has a pronounced asymmetry in signal flow through the device , as shown by the graphical scattering matrix in fig .",
    "we therefore label the three ports in the directional amplifier by the roles played by their inputs as the signal ( s ) input , idler ( i ) input , and vacuum ( v ) input .",
    "signals incident on s correspond to the directional amplifier input , while signals exiting i form its output .",
    "the s port is matched ( no power reflects ) , and incident power is instead transmitted with gain to the i and v ports .",
    "vacuum fluctuations incident on i are responsible for the additional half - photon of added quantum noise necessarily associated with quantum - limited phase - preserving amplification .",
    "signals incident on the v port are noiselessly and directionally transmitted through the device to the s port with unity photon gain",
    ". any device must necessarily reflect , at a minimum , vacuum fluctuations back to the upstream signal source . in our implementation the source of these fluctuations",
    "would be provided by the cold @xmath34  @xmath35 load terminating the v port .",
    "furthermore , the unity - gain transmission of signals from the v to the s port follows from the combined requirements of quantum - limited amplification ( sending it to i would degrade the noise performance of the device ) and the information conserving nature of the device ( no entropy produced since we assume the pump to be perfectly stiff)@xcite .",
    "changing @xmath31 by @xmath36 flips which physical port plays the role of s and v , with i remaining unchanged .",
    "the roles can be further re - mapped by changing which pair of modes is linked via conversion and thus , in general , each of the three physical ports can play each role .",
    "we note that combining two gain processes with gain @xmath18 yields a directional amplifier with gain @xmath18 , not @xmath37 .",
    "the combined operation should be thought of as rerouting the outputs of one port of a non - directional amplifier ( from s to v ) rather than as two independent stages of amplification .    unlike the circulator , which is relatively forgiving of imperfect conversion ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "the directional amplifier is much less tolerant of non - idealities .",
    "its directionality is only achieved when the conversion process is adjusted so that @xmath39 ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "this behavior is demonstrated theoretically in fig .",
    "the gains have been set to a finite value of @xmath40  db , and the input match , initially perfect , degrades as the conversion coefficient decreases .",
    "for any pair of finite gains , there exists a conversion coefficient ( @xmath41 for @xmath42  db ) below which any semblance of directional amplification is lost .",
    "2a shows a schematic of our experimental setup anchored to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator operated below @xmath43  mk .",
    "a detailed diagram of the experimental setup , including both the details of the measurement setup with a 2-port vector network analyzer ( vna ) and the fridge wiring , can be found in supp .",
    "fig .  s4 . in the experiment ,",
    "our jpc is slightly modified from the generic one , having an @xmath44-junction jrm .",
    "the inner four junctions do not participate in the coupling hamiltonian , instead increasing the device s tuneability and providing stability near the half - flux - quantum working point @xcite .",
    "the frequencies of all three modes can be tuned over a 400 mhz span by varying the external magnetic flux through the ring . for this experiment",
    "we have chosen a flux such that mode @xmath0 is at @xmath4  ghz with @xmath6  mhz , mode  is at @xmath5  ghz with @xmath7  mhz , and mode  is at @xmath8  ghz with @xmath9  mhz .",
    "the jpc is connected via cascaded @xmath45 hybrids ( krytar 4040124 ) in order to separately address all three modes .",
    "pumps and probe tones are applied to each mode via the weakly coupled port of a directional coupler ( krytar 104020020 ) connected to each hybrid . for probing the device in the circulator mode ,",
    "the signal power at the output of the vna of @xmath46  dbm was applied , right before saturation effects appeared ( see supp .",
    "s4 for line attenuations ) . for probing the device in the directional amplifier mode ,",
    "the signal power at the output of the vna was @xmath47  dbm , which was well out of the saturated regime .",
    "the difference in probe power for these two modes is expected since the output power of the device must remain the same in both cases .",
    "we verified that in the absence of any pump the modes are completely orthogonal , for example , when probing mode @xmath0 , no response is seen at the frequency of modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "all pumps were generated by physically separate generators locked to a common @xmath48  mhz rubidium frequency standard , ensuring the stability of the total pump phase during an experimental run .",
    "we realize a josephson circulator by coupling all three modes pairwise via conversion processes as previously described .",
    "when the total pump phase is set to @xmath49 , circulation is clockwise from mode  to  to as shown in fig .  3a .",
    "when @xmath29 is changed by @xmath36 , with no other changes to pump parameters , the sense- of circulation is reversed ( fig .",
    "the pump frequencies and powers at their respective generator outputs were @xmath50  ghz , @xmath51  dbm , @xmath52  ghz , @xmath53  dbm , and @xmath54  ghz , @xmath55  dbm , corresponding to conversion coefficients @xmath56 of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "these processes were first applied singly , and the resultant conversion processes were compared to collectively maximize the conversion coefficients while simultaneously matching the single mode frequency responses of all three modes ( supp .",
    "the magnitude of the conversion coefficients were then fine - tuned by maximizing the magnitude and symmetry of both the input match and the reverse isolation of all three ports of the circulator .",
    "figure 3b shows the complete set of measured scattering parameters ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) for the circulator as a function of probe frequency . for the diagonal components of the scattering matrix , the reflected output is directed to an amplifier chain and recorded at room temperature by the vna .",
    "off - diagonal components of the scattering matrix involve inputs and outputs which are at different frequencies , and therefore the output tones are mixed with a local oscillator at the corresponding difference frequency to translate them back to the probe tone frequency prior to being acquired by the vna .",
    "we identify the unknown offset in the total phase @xmath29 by finding the two values , differing by @xmath36 , for which @xmath62 is minimized . following the convention in the theory section",
    ", we assign @xmath49 to clockwise circulation .",
    "we note that it suffices to vary only one pump phase to achieve a desired @xmath29 , and so only the phase of the pump applied to  was varied for all data shown in this paper , although we verified in a separate experiment that the response to all three pump phases was equivalent .    as seen in fig .",
    "3b , on resonance we have a matched device ( with reflection better than @xmath63  db ) exhibiting more than @xmath64  db reverse isolation , and less than @xmath65",
    "db of insertion loss .",
    "the insertion loss is calibrated relative to the three individual conversion processes , which have been previously demonstrated to be efficient to within @xmath66  db@xcite . off resonance , the bandwidth of the individual conversion processes which comprise the circulator combine to give an @xmath67  mhz bandwidth over which the input match of all ports is better than @xmath63  db and the insertion loss is better than @xmath68  db .    simply flipping the pump phase by @xmath36 to @xmath69 , without any other variation of pump parameters ,",
    "switches the direction of circulation , as shown .",
    "we see no degradation in overall device performance , and good agreement with theoretical calculations for the scattering parameters in both directions , given that the only input the theory uses is the three mode bandwidths and the conversion coefficients of the three individually pumped conversion processes .",
    "we note that most deviations are associated with signals input to mode .",
    "we attribute these to the degradation in the spatial mode matching due to phase mismatches in the three cascaded hybrids versus  and  which each pass through a single hybrid .",
    "the overall device performance is limited by imperfections in the pairwise conversion processes and drift in the overall pump phase .",
    "we also characterized the device by measuring two representative scattering parameters , @xmath62 and @xmath70 , as a continuous function of pump phase ( fig .",
    "the data are in excellent agreement with theory , showing three working points with alternating circulation directions at points separated by @xmath36 in phase ( @xmath71 ) , with smooth transitions in the scattering parameters versus frequencies in between .",
    "further experimental and theoretical work are required to predict and characterize the effect of higher order nonlinearities on the fine details of the device performance .",
    "this is especially vital for determining how many probe photons the device can process without degradation of performance .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we realize a directional amplifier by setting , in the triangle of modes , two legs to conjugating photon gain processes and the remaining leg to a unity - gain photon conversion process ( fig .",
    "modes  and  are coupled so that @xmath72 via a pump applied at @xmath73  ghz with a power of @xmath74  dbm at the generator output , modes  and  with @xmath75 db via a pump at @xmath76  ghz with @xmath77  dbm , and modes  and  with @xmath42 db via a pump at @xmath78  ghz with @xmath79  dbm .",
    "these values were chosen experimentally both to approach perfect conversion and to minimize frequency offsets in the single pump mode responses subject to the constraint @xmath80 ( supp .",
    "s2 ) . here , as with the circulator we remove offsets in the pump phases by finding @xmath31 values for which @xmath81 is minimized .",
    "we again define @xmath31 to be @xmath82 at these points , the sign being set by the direction of amplification .    in this mode of operation",
    ", physical ports can take on different roles depending on which modes are coupled via conversion and on the value of @xmath31 .",
    "given our pump frequency configuration , when we set @xmath83 , mode  is the signal port s , mode  the vacuum port v , and mode  the idler port i as shown in the fig .",
    "the scattering parameters are plotted in fig .",
    "4b , showing all the hallmarks of directional amplification .",
    "first , the input ports s and v show a reflection coefficient of @xmath84  db or greater , indicating the device is matched , while the third port shows gain in reflection .",
    "next , signals input at s are amplified and transmitted to i and v ( gain of @xmath85  db ) .",
    "third , signals incident on i are isolated from s ( with isolation of @xmath44  db ) , and are instead reflected from i and transmitted to v with gain .",
    "finally , signals incident on v are transmitted with near unity photon gain to s ( @xmath86  db ) . in normal operation , port v will be terminated in a cold @xmath34  @xmath35 load and can be seen as providing the necessary vacuum fluctuations which must be emitted from s. the directional gain falls off with probe frequency as a lorentzian lineshape with a @xmath87-db bandwidth of @xmath67  mhz , though we note that other bandwidths can be defined based on the required input match or reverse isolation .",
    "changing the total pump phase to @xmath88 switches the roles of mode  and mode .",
    "this is most directly seen by comparing @xmath89 and @xmath90 , in which the direction of the gain reverses . as shown by the correspondence with the theory curves , all the other scattering parameters also change as expected .",
    "again , the theory curves are calculated with the 3 mode bandwidths and the individual gain and conversion coefficients . in general",
    ", the agreement is not as good as for the circulator which we attribute to the fact that there is now gain in the system and therefore misalignments of the pairwise processes and phase drifts can more drastically affect the amplifier performance . in practical implementations ,",
    "interferometric techniques could be used to stabilize @xmath31 , or several matched , low - gain stages could be cascaded to achieve high net gain without requiring extreme pump precision .",
    "as with the circulator , more sophisticated theoretical analysis is needed to understand the effects of higher - order nonlinearities .",
    "the effect of such nonlinearities can be seen , for instance , in distortions of the conversion process shown in supp .",
    "these are also crucial to understanding the dynamic range of the amplifier .",
    "one of the most important characteristics of such paramps is the noise performance .",
    "this is characterized by the noise visibility ratio ( nvr ) of the device , defined as the excess noise visible in a spectrum analyzer at room temperature when the amplifier is turned on versus off .",
    "this technique offers a proxy for the more difficult direct measurement of the noise temperature , for example via the measurement induced dephasing of a qubit@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can infer the directional amplifier noise performance by comparing to the single gain process of the jpc , which has been previously shown to be nearly quantum - limited@xcite . as shown in fig .  4c , we observe nvr only at the outputs which have gain ( i and v ) and not at the isolated input port ( s ) .",
    "the measured nvr for directional gain agrees to within @xmath68   db with the associated single pairwise coupling with the same gain , although there are slight shifts of the center frequencies .",
    "this indicates that the noise performance of the directional amplifier is essentially as quantum - limited as the conventional non - directional phase - preserving amplifier mode of the jpc .",
    "finally , we examine the behavior of the device as a function of the conversion coefficient ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "as detailed in the theory section , the conversion process must dominate for the amplifier to be directional .",
    "the dependence of two representative scattering parameters @xmath62 and @xmath89 corresponding to input match and directional gain , respectively , are shown for selected conversion coefficients . as expected , the magnitude of all scattering parameters rises as the conversion coefficient decreases , with complete loss of input match and even reflection gain being observed once @xmath56 falls below a certain threshold ( here @xmath41 , matching the expected value described in the theory section ) .",
    "this threshold rises with the amplifier gain ; we have chosen a directional gain of @xmath85  db in order to retain sufficient input match .",
    "in general , to achieve a single - stage directional amplifier with high forward gain while retaining a matched input , one requires , surprisingly , a nearly perfect converter as the key element .",
    "we have successfully realized a josephson circuit that performs the functions of both a circulator and a directional amplifier .",
    "each function is determined by a specific pump configuration consisting of three pump frequencies , amplitudes and phases . to our knowledge",
    ", this work represents the first successful implementation of a josephson microwave circulator , a device of great practical and theoretical interest .",
    "since the circuit is minimally composed of purely dispersive elements , we expect it to be essentially noise - less , unlike in previous proposals @xcite .",
    "this same low - loss construction results in nearly quantum - limited noise performance of the circuit when operated as a directional amplifier . additionally , the simplicity of the device can be an advantage when compared to previous josephson junction based directional amplifier implementations such as voltage - biased dc - squids ( superconducting quantum inteference devices ) @xcite , non - linear superconducting transmission lines @xcite , and coupled jpcs @xcite .",
    "our results are in good qualitative agreement with theory , but some discrepancies remain which we attribute to neglect of higher order terms in the theory , as well as imperfection in our control of the relative phase of the pumps .",
    "further work is needed to analyze the dynamic range characteristics , off - resonant response , and higher order mixing products .",
    "our present implementation can be optimized , for example by eliminating the cascaded microwave hybrids .",
    "their elimination by further microwave engineering can render the device fully planar , and will also remove potential sources of loss and mismatch which degrade the device performance .",
    "this methodology , combined with the absence of any large magnetic fields , has excellent prospects for on - chip integration with standard circuit qed @xcite systems , and in other cryogenic measurements using microwave signals , such as kinetic inductance detectors@xcite , dispersive magnetometers@xcite , and quantum nano - mechanical resonators@xcite .",
    "our work also demonstrates that different kinds of non - reciprocal devices can be fundamentally linked . at the basic level ,",
    "directionality in our devices arises from the non - reciprocal phase shift that signals acquire via a parametric two - mode interaction .",
    "this has important implications for the design of future directional devices .",
    "an open question that remains is what are the minimal number and nature of couplings needed to produce a desired non - reciprocal scattering matrix . as an example , still more exotic amplifiers such as a directional phase - sensitive amplifier can also potentially be realized along the same lines as in our experiment by the same three modes coupled via a different set of parametric pumps@xcite .",
    "furthermore , these two - body interactions can be switched on the fly with a switching time limited by the bandwidth of the device .",
    "this results in a flexible device , which can be used to build more complicated signal routing schemes . as an example",
    ", we believe these in - situ switchable directional elements could be the basis of a truly quantum switch matrix / gain medium , as pursued in other quantum information platforms@xcite .",
    "we are indebted to leonardo ranzani for his in - depth presentation at yale of the graph theory of non - reciprocity .",
