    ", mcgrath treated the case of the full plane @xcite , and finally kikuchi studied the exterior domains @xcite . in the case",
    "where the vorticity is only assumed to be bounded , existence and uniqueness of a weak solution has been established by yudovich in @xcite .",
    "we quote that the well - posedness result of yudovitch applies to smooth bounded domains , and to unbounded ones under further decay assumptions .",
    "we stress that all above studies require @xmath5 to be at least @xmath11 .",
    "roughly , the reason is the following : due to the non - local character of the euler equation , these works rely on global in space estimates of @xmath12 in terms of @xmath13 .",
    "these estimates _ up to the boundary _ involve biot and savart type kernels , corresponding to operators such as @xmath14 . unfortunately",
    ", such operators are known to behave badly in general non - smooth domains .",
    "this explains why well - posedness results are dedicated to regular domains .",
    "however the case of a singular obstacle is physically relevant .",
    "for example , the study of the perturbation created by a plane wing stays a capital issue to determine the safety time between two landings in big airports .    without solving the question of uniqueness , taylor established in @xcite the existence of a global weak solution of - in a bounded sharp convex domain .",
    "he used that @xmath15 convex implies that the solution @xmath16 of the dirichlet problem @xmath17 belongs to @xmath18 when the source term @xmath19 belongs to @xmath20 , irrespective of the domain regularity .",
    "nevertheless , this interesting result still leaves aside many situations of practical interest , notably flows around irregular obstacles .",
    "recently , the article @xcite gave such a result in the exterior of a @xmath21 jordan arc , where it is noted that the velocity blows up near the end - points of the arc .",
    "in particular , it shows that the previous property on the dirichlet problem is false in domains with some bad corners .",
    "the question of the existence of global weak solutions is now solved for a large class of singular domains in @xcite .",
    "the authors therein considered two kinds of domains : any open bounded domain where we retrieve a fixed ( possibly zero ) number of closed sets with positive capacity , and any exterior domain of one connected closed set with positive capacity .",
    "_ our goal here is to prove that such a solution is unique if the domain is bounded , simply connected with some corners , or if it is the complementary of a closed simply connected bounded set with some corners .",
    "we prove the uniqueness for an initial vorticity which is bounded , compactly supported in @xmath2 and having a definite sign_.    more precisely , we consider two kinds of domains . on one hand , we denote by @xmath15 a bounded , simply connected open set , such that @xmath22 has a finite number of corners @xmath23 with angles @xmath24 ( i.e. locally , @xmath2 coincides with the sector @xmath25 ) . on the other hand , we denote by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a bounded , simply connected closed set , such that @xmath22 has a finite number of corners .    to define a global weak solution to the euler equation ,",
    "let us point out that the space @xmath20 is not suitable for weak solutions in unbounded domain .",
    "working with square integrable velocities in exterior domains is too restrictive ( see page to note that @xmath12 behaves in general like @xmath28 at infinity ) , so we consider initial data satisfying @xmath29 note that the divergence free condition and this last impermeability condition have to be understood in the weak sense : for any @xmath30 , @xmath31 let us stress that this set of initial data is large : we will show later that for any function @xmath32 , there exists @xmath10 verifying with @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , the weak form of the divergence free and tangency conditions on the euler solution @xmath12 will read : @xmath34 finally , the weak form of the momentum equation on @xmath12 will read : @xmath35    for @xmath2 an open bounded simply connected domain , or @xmath2 the complementary of a compact simply connected domain @xmath36 , we get the existence of a weak solution from @xcite :    [ theorem1 ] assume that @xmath10 verifies",
    ". then there exists @xmath37 which is a global weak solution of - in the sense of and .    in a few words , this existence result follows from a compactness argument , performed on a sequence of solutions @xmath38 of the euler equations on the sequence of approximating domains @xmath39 .",
    "a key ingredient of the proof is the so - called @xmath40-convergence of @xmath39 to @xmath15 ( see @xcite for the details ) .",
    "the main result of this article concerns the uniqueness of global weak solutions , when the initial vorticity has definite sign .",

    "we need the circulation around @xmath27 .",
    "as we will see in subsection [ sect : exist ] , for @xmath10 verifying , we can define the initial circulation : @xmath44 inversely , let us mention that we can fix independently the vorticity and the circulation : we will show that for any function @xmath32 and any real number @xmath45 , there exists a unique @xmath10 verifying with @xmath33 and with circulation around @xmath36 equal to @xmath46 .    assuming a sign condition on @xmath47",
    ", we will prove a uniqueness theorem in exterior domains .",
    "[ main 2 ] let @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a compact , simply connected set , such that @xmath22 has a finite number of corners with angles greater than @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath10 verifying .",
    "if @xmath42 is non - positive and @xmath48(respectively @xmath42 non - negative and @xmath49 ) , then there exists a unique global weak solution of the euler equations on @xmath2 , verifying @xmath43    in particular , we will also prove that the velocity blows up near the obtuse corners : if @xmath22 admits at @xmath50 a corner of angle @xmath51 , then the velocity behaves near @xmath50 like @xmath52 .",
    "we refind that in the case where @xmath36 is a jordan arc ( see @xcite ) the velocity blows up like the inverse of the square root of the distance near the end - points ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "therefore , we manage to adapt the yudovich proof for a velocity ( and the gradient of the velocity ) not bounded up to the boundary .",
    "the key here is to use the sign condition in theorems [ main 1 ] and [ main 2 ] in order to prove that the vorticity never meets the boundary .    for a sake of clarity ,",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is locally a corner , but we can replace a corner by a singular point , where the jump of the tangent angle is equal to @xmath51 ( see remark [ dt loc ] ) .    the remainder of this work is organized in six sections .",
    "we introduce in section [ sect : 2 ] the biholomorphism @xmath54 and the biot - savart law ( law giving the velocity in terms of the vorticity ) in the interior or the exterior of one simply connected domain .",
    "we will recall the existence of weak solution in this section , and derive some formulations ( on vorticity and on extensions in @xmath55 ) .",
    "we will take advantage of this section to show that the weak solution is a renormalized solution in the sense of diperna - lions @xcite , which will allow us to prove that the @xmath56 norm of the vorticity for @xmath57 $ ] , the total mass @xmath58 and the circulation of the velocity around @xmath27 are conserved quantities .",
    "let us mention that the explicit form of the biot - savart law is one of the key of this work , and it explains why @xmath2 is assumed to be the interior or the exterior of a simply connected domain .",
    "this law will read @xmath59\\ ] ] where @xmath60 $ ] is an integral operator .",
    "using classical elliptic theory , we will obtain the exact behavior of the biholomorphism @xmath54 near the corners , and then the behavior of the velocity .",
    "we note that the blow - up is stronger if the angle @xmath51 is bigger .",
    "unfortunately , the following study needs sometimes that the integral operator @xmath60 $ ] verifies good estimates , which are possible only if we assume that all the angles @xmath24 are greater than @xmath41 ( namely in proposition [ biot est ] to prove that @xmath60 $ ] is bounded , in lemma [ ortho ] to establish the equation verified by the extended functions , in lemma [ w11 ] to use the renormalization theory ) .",
    "section [ sect : 3 ] is the central part of this paper : we will prove that the support of @xmath7 never meets the boundary if we assume that the characteristics corresponding to exist and are differentiable .",
    "the idea is to introduce a good liapounov function , which blows up if the trajectories meet the boundary .",
    "next , we will establish some estimates implying that this liapounov energy is bounded which will give the result .",
    "although we can not say that the characteristics are regular for weak solutions , this computation gives us an excellent intuition .    in light of this proof , we rigorously prove in section [ sect : 4 ] , thanks to the renormalization theory , that we have the same property , even if we do not consider the characteristics .    finally , we prove theorems [ main 1]-[main 2 ] in section [ sect : 5 ]",
    ". we will introduce @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the biot - savart kernel in the full plane . as @xmath7 does not meet the boundary , it means that @xmath63 in a neighborhood of the boundary , i.e. @xmath16 is harmonic therein .",
    "this provides in particular a control of its @xmath64 norm ( as well as the @xmath64 norm for the gradient ) by its @xmath65 norm .",
    "although the total velocity is not bounded near the boundary , but just integrable , this argument allows us to yield a gronwall - type estimate , as yudovich did .",
    "therefore , the fact that the support of the vorticity stays far from the boundary will imply the uniqueness result .",
    "this idea was already used in @xcite , in the case of one dirac mass in the vorticity . in this article",
    ", we consider the euler equations in @xmath55 when the initial vorticity is composed by a regular part @xmath66 and a dirac mass .",
    "the equation is called the system mixed euler / point vortex and derived in @xcite .",
    "when trajectories exist , it is proved that they do not meet the point vortex in @xcite if the point vortex moves on the influence of the regular part , and in @xcite if the dirac is fixed .",
    "the method is also constructed on liapounov functions .",
    "an important issue in @xcite is to generalize this result when trajectories are not regular .",
    "the lagrangian formulation gives us a helpful intuition , it is the reason why we choose first to present the proof of uniqueness assuming the differentiability of trajectories ( section [ sect : 3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , proving in section [ sect : 4 ] that the vorticity never meets the boundary , we state that the `` weak '' lagrangian flow coming from the renormalization theory evolves in the area far from the corners .",
    "as the velocity is regular enough in this region , we can conclude that the flow is actually classical and regular .",
    "section [ sect : technical ] is devoted to the proofs of some technical lemmas .",
    "we finish this article by section [ sect : 6 ] with some final comments . in the exterior of the wing plane",
    ", we will try to give a mathematical justification of the kutta - joukowski condition . in the exterior of the jordan arc ( see @xcite ) , we will make a parallel with the vortex sheet problem",
    ". we will also give some explanations about the sign assumptions in the main theorems .",
    "we warn the reader that we write in general the proofs in the case of exterior domains . in this kind of domain",
    ", we have to take care of integrability at infinity , to control the size of the support of the vorticity , and we have also to consider harmonic vector fields and circulations of velocities around @xmath27 . the proofs in the case of bounded domains are strictly easier , without additional arguments .",
    "we will make sometimes some remarks about that .",
    "as in @xcite , the crucial assumption is that we work in dimension two outside ( or inside ) one simply connected domain . identifying @xmath55 with the complex plane @xmath67",
    ", there exists a biholomorphism @xmath54 mapping @xmath2 to the exterior ( resp . to the interior ) of the unit disk . thanks to this biholomorphism , we will obtain an explicit formula for the biot - savart law : the law giving the velocity in terms of the vorticity .",
    "this explicit formula will be used to construct the liapounov function .",
    "we give in the following subsection the properties of this riemann mapping .",
    "let @xmath2 as in theorem [ main 2 ] ( resp .",
    "as in theorem [ main 1 ] ) , then the riemann mapping theorem states that there exists a unique biholomorphism @xmath54 mapping @xmath2 to @xmath68 ( resp . to @xmath69 ) such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( resp . @xmath72 and @xmath73 , for a @xmath74 ) .",
    "we remind that the last two conditions mean @xmath75    [ grisvard ] let assume that @xmath22 is a @xmath76 jordan curve , except in a finite number of point @xmath77 , @xmath78 , ... , @xmath79 where @xmath22 admits corner of angle @xmath80 ( i.e. @xmath2 coincides locally with the sector @xmath25 ) .",
    "then the biholomorphism @xmath54 defined above satisfies    * @xmath81 and @xmath54 extend continuously up to the boundary ; * @xmath82 extends continuously up to the boundary , except at the points @xmath83 with @xmath84 where @xmath82 behaves like @xmath85 ; * @xmath86 extends continuously up to the boundary , except at the points @xmath23 with @xmath87 where @xmath86 behaves like @xmath88 ; * @xmath89 belongs to @xmath90 for any @xmath91 .    as @xmath22 is @xmath92 , the kellogg - warschawski theorem ( theorem 3.6 in @xcite ) states directly",
    "that @xmath54 and @xmath81 is continuous up to the boundary . for the behavior of the derivatives , we use the classical elliptic theory : let @xmath93 as @xmath54 is holomorphic , we have that @xmath94 to localize near each corners , we can introduce a smooth cutoff function @xmath95 supported in a small neighborhood of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we are exactly in the setting of elliptic studies : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the sector @xmath25 .",

    "then , the shift theorem states that @xmath119 belongs to @xmath120 , so it belongs to @xmath115 .",
    "thanks to formula of @xmath121 , we see that @xmath122 is continuous up to the boundary , except near @xmath23 where @xmath123 .",
    "next , we derive once more to obtain that @xmath124 belongs to @xmath125 , so it belongs to @xmath126 for any @xmath1 .",

    "since the vorticity @xmath620 is compactly supported , we have for large @xmath192 @xmath897 hence @xmath661 belongs to @xmath898 for all @xmath578 .",
    "it follows in particular that @xmath899 and also that @xmath900 belongs to @xmath901 .",
    "since @xmath661 is divergence - free , we have @xmath902 , and so @xmath903 .",

    "one of the crucial issues in biggest airports is the following : the wings of a plane create ( at landing and take off ) an important vortex where another plane should not pass through .",
    "we can find in history some examples of crashes due to these turbulences .",
    "consequently , airports decided to define a safety time between two planes , in order that the wake vortex dissipates .",
    "however , this safety time have to be redefined because of `` very heavy '' new airplanes as the airbus a380 . increasing",
    "the time between two planes for security is in contradiction with the traffic jam in the main airports .",
    "several programs were created in order to understand and optimize this phenomena .",
    "one of the solutions investigated is the creation of big radars which try to detect if the vortex ( of course invisible ) has vanished .",
    "however , engineers and physicists are not able to interpret the data given by the radar , because we do not know the exact shape of the vortex behind a plane wing",
    ".    air around an infinite air plane wing can be modeled by euler equation in dimension two around a singular obstacle : smooth except in one point where we have a cusp ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the consequence of this article and of @xcite is to show that we have existence and uniqueness of a solution to such a problem , and that we have an explicit form of the velocity in terms of the vorticity and the shape of the wing . in particular , we show that the velocity blows up like @xmath153 . thanks to this explicit formula ( see ) , it should be possible to plug it in order to obtain the shape of the stream line .",
    "actually , in order to apply exactly this article , we consider that the wing is fixed in the plane frame , but the velocity at infinity is equal to @xmath922 where @xmath923 is the velocity of the plane .",
    "having vector field constant at infinity instead of vanishing , change a bit the biot - savart law but not the final result and the behavior near the obstacle . to be convinced ,",
    "the reader can read ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.4 ) , where we adapt @xcite with constant velocity at infinity .      as the velocity stays tangent to the obstacle , we know that the trajectory of a flow particle which arrives to the solid will be deformed , and the particle will leave behind the solid .",
    "indeed , we have proved that this particle will never meet the boundary . by reversibility of time , it also means that a particle near the boundary stays close to the boundary , even if the particle goes closer and closer to a corner .",
    "therefore , near the trailing edge of a plane wing , the particle has a velocity which blows up , but it stays close to the boundary . for the euler equation ,",
    "this particle should take the turn of the corner with a huge tangential velocity , but moving in a small neighborhood of the boundaries .",
    "such a kind of behavior can justify that for infinite velocity , the euler equations are no longer relevant for modeling the air near the corners .",
    "this observation is well known by engineers and they use an unproved principle , the so - called kutta condition : `` _ a body with a sharp trailing edge which is moving through a fluid will create about itself a circulation of sufficient strength to hold the rear stagnation point at the trailing edge _ '' .",
    "in other word , even if initially @xmath924 , they assume that there is a creation of circulation or vorticity such that the fluid particles near the edge go away from the obstacle .",

    "the existence of a weak solution is a consequence of a compactness argument .",
    "indeed , we consider therein the unique solutions @xmath38 of the euler equations on the smooth domain @xmath39 , which converges to @xmath2 in some senses .",
    "then , in these articles , we extract a subsequence such that @xmath925 and we check that @xmath12 is solution of the euler equations in @xmath2 . putting together the present result with @xcite , we can state the following .",
    "let @xmath364 , @xmath47 , @xmath2 as in theorems [ main 1 ] or [ main 2 ] . for any sequence of smooth open simply connected domains ( or exterior of simply connected domains ) @xmath926 converging to @xmath2 in the hausdorff sense , then the unique solution @xmath38 of the euler equations on @xmath926 , with initial datum @xmath927 such that @xmath928 converges in @xmath929 to the unique solution @xmath12 of the euler equations on @xmath2 with initial datum @xmath930 such that @xmath931      in @xcite , we consider some smooth domains @xmath932 which shrink to a @xmath21 jordan arc @xmath165 as @xmath265 tends to zero .",
    "for @xmath933 and @xmath45 given , we denote by @xmath934 the corresponding regular solutions of the euler equations on @xmath935 .",
    "up to a truncated smoothly over a size @xmath265 around the obstacle , it is proved therein that the resulting truncations @xmath936 and @xmath937 , defined over the whole of @xmath55 , converge in appropriate topologies to the solutions @xmath642 , @xmath938 of the system @xmath939 this is an euler like equation , modified by a dirac mass along the arc .",
    "the density function @xmath940 is given explicitly in terms of @xmath938 and @xmath941 .",
    "moreover , it is shown that it is equal to the jump of the tangential component of the velocity across the arc .",
    "we refer to @xcite for all necessary details .    actually , the presence of this additional measure is mandatory in order that the velocity @xmath642 is tangent to the curve , with circulation @xmath46 around it .",
    "therefore , in the exterior of a jordan arc , appears to be a special vortex sheet , `` special '' because the support of the dirac mass does not move ( staying to be @xmath165 ) and because the normal component of the velocity on the curve is equal to zero . for a general vortex sheet",
    ", we can prove that the normal component is continuous , but not necessarily zero . in both case",
    ", we have a jump of the tangential component .",
    "a consequence of the present work is the uniqueness of a solution of , with the good sign conditions for @xmath364 and @xmath46 ( see theorem [ main 2 ] ) .",
    "for instance , if we assume that @xmath165 is the segment @xmath942 $ ] , then we have the explicit expression of the harmonic vector field thanks to the joukowski function , and we can find in @xcite the following : @xmath943 then , choosing @xmath944 and @xmath945 , we have proven that the stationary function @xmath946 is the unique solution of the euler equations with initial vorticity @xmath947 .    adding a vorticity or considering other shape for @xmath165 complicates a lot the expression of @xmath940 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we do not prove the uniqueness for the so - called prandtl - munk vortex sheet : @xmath948 .      as it is remarked several times ,",
    "the crucial point is to prove that the vorticity never meets the boundary if we consider an initial vorticity compactly supported in @xmath2 .",
    "however , we can extend easily this result to the case of an initial vorticity constant to the boundary .",
    "indeed , for @xmath949 given , choosing @xmath950 in the proof of proposition [ constant_vorticity_2 ] gives in the same way the following .",
    "let @xmath7 be a global weak solution of such that @xmath364 is compactly supported in @xmath847 and such that @xmath951 in a neighborhood of the boundary .",
    "if @xmath364 is non - positive and @xmath421 ( only for exterior domain ) , then , for any @xmath431 , there exists a neighborhood @xmath515 of @xmath516 such that @xmath952.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , in the proof of the uniqueness , we still have on @xmath605 @xmath953 which implies that the velocity @xmath603 is harmonic near the boundary , allowing us to follow exactly the proof made in section [ sect : 5 ] .",
    "let us present in this subsection the different liapounov functions , the advantage of each , and why it is specific to the case studied .",
    "_ vortex wave system in @xmath55 .",
    "_ let us consider that the initial vorticity is composed on a regular part plus a dirac mass centered at the point @xmath342 .",
    "then marchioro and pulvirenti proved in @xcite that there exists one solution to the following system : @xmath954 which means that the point vortex @xmath342 moves under the velocity field @xmath16 produced by the regular part @xmath7 of the vorticity , whereas the regular part and the vortex point give rise to a smooth flow @xmath955 along which @xmath7 is constant .",
    "in this case , we can prove that the trajectories never meet the point vortex considering the following liapounov function : @xmath956 for @xmath957 fixed .",
    "we note that @xmath370 goes to @xmath313 iff @xmath958 , so we want to prove that @xmath370 stays bounded .",
    "next we compute : @xmath959 next , we use that the regular part @xmath16 is log - lipschitz in order to obtain a gronwall - type inequality . to summarize",
    ", we remark that in the case , the important points are : @xmath960 removing the singular part .",
    "_ dirac mass fixed in @xmath55 .",
    "_ marchioro in @xcite studied exactly the same problem as above , assuming that the vortex mass can not move .",
    "therefore , the previous liapounov does not work , because we do not have a difference of two velocities and we can not use the log - lipschitz regularity . in this article , the author introduced a new liapounov : @xmath961 where the first integral is the stream function associated to @xmath16 . then , the first step was to prove that this integral is bounded , which implies that @xmath370 goes to @xmath313 iff @xmath962 .",
    "next , he computed : @xmath963 next , the second step was to prove some good estimate for the right hand side integral in order to conclude by the gronwall lemma . here",
    ", we see that the singular term is now passed in a integral , which is bounded .",
    "similarly , we note that the important points in this case are : @xmath964    _ interior or exterior of simply connected domains . _ in our case , we have again an explicit formula of the velocity by the biot - savart law ( see and ) .",
    "as the velocity near the boundary blows up , we have to make appear some cancellation as marchioro did , in order that the singular part goes in an integral .",
    "to do that , we introduce the stream function associated to the velocity : @xmath965 with @xmath966 in the bounded case .",
    "however , as this function tends to zero ( instead to @xmath967 ) when @xmath968 ( see lemma [ l1 maj ] ) , we add a logarithm : @xmath969 and the goal is to prove that @xmath370 stays bounded . then , we computed in section [ sect : 3 ] @xmath970 and we proved that @xmath444 tends to zero as @xmath971 , comparing the rate with @xmath359 .",
    "then , we see here that it is important that @xmath444 goes to zero where @xmath359 tends to zero .",
    "we managed to prove that @xmath444 tends to zero near the boundary , and the sign condition allows us to state that the boundary is the only set where @xmath359 vanishes ( see lemma [ l1 est ] ) .",
    "for instance , in bounded domain ( i.e. @xmath966 ) we see that a vorticity with different sign can imply that @xmath972 somewhere else than on @xmath22 .",
    "this last remark is the main reason of the sign condition of the vorticity .",
    "next , the sign condition on the circulation follows from the fact that we want the same sign for both terms in @xmath359 .",
    "therefore , one difference with the case studied by marchioro is that the stream function of the harmonic vector field does not blow - up . to conclude ,",
    "let us mention that the liapounov method is specific to the case studied and it is hard to adapt for other cases . for example , we have presented here the case of dirac mass when @xmath973 , when @xmath974 , but we do not know how to prove for other dynamics , like e.g. @xmath975 .",
