    "brane interactions in the brane world have been proposed as the origin of inflation @xcite , an epoch in the early universe that initiated the radiation - dominated big bang . in brane inflation",
    "@xcite the inflaton is an open string mode , while the brane interaction comes from the exchange of closed string modes .",
    "a particularly simple scenario is the @xmath0-brane - anti-@xmath0-brane system .",
    "although the potential between them seems too steep , it was proposed @xcite that the compactification effect in the special case of a hyper - cubic torus will flatten the inflaton potential for enough inflation .",
    "let us call this the @xmath1 scenario .",
    "recently , it was pointed out @xcite that the poisson equation for the inflaton potential @xmath2 in a compactified manifold should include a background term ( the so - called `` jellium '' term in solid state physics ) . as a result ,",
    "the slow - roll parameter @xmath3 in the @xmath1 inflationary scenario ( in the simplified version where the stabilization of compactification moduli is independent of the inflaton ) becomes [ mald ] -2/where @xmath4 is the number of dimensions perpendicular to the branes , @xmath5 .",
    "since we need at least @xmath6 e - folds of inflation , and @xmath7 , the @xmath1 scenario is not viable as an inflationary model .",
    "the impact of the jellium term is clearly important to the analysis of the inflationary properties in some of these scenarios .",
    "this was first studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we would like to point out that the brane inflationary scenario where branes are at a small angle @xcite remains robust because the jellium term is much smaller in this scenario . in the @xmath8 , @xmath9 wrapping scenario ( which reduces to @xmath10 parallel d4-branes after inflation ) , - where @xmath11 is the angle between the two branes ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 are reasonable values ) .",
    "when the jellium contribution to @xmath14 is much less than @xmath15 , the slow - roll behavior of the inflaton is dictated by the other terms in the potential , in particular the quartic harmonic term as measured around the antipodal point , as studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "we would also like to point out that the @xmath1 scenario may still be possible under some special conditions . whether that special condition on the background charge distribution is realized or not depends on the dynamics of moduli stabilization ( the dilaton , the complex and khler structures of the compactified manifold etc . ) , an issue that needs better understanding @xcite .    in section 2 , we give a review of the poisson equation in compact spaces .",
    "a simple ansatz of calculating the potential energy between two charges is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the potential due to the the second charge @xmath18 , irrespective of whether the source charges in compact space add to zero or not .",
    "we shall justify this ansatz by showing that it is equivalent ( up to a constant ) to the potential energy between two charges ( ns - ns or rr ) by directly integrating the potential energy density over the compact space .",
    "this equivalence is simply illustrated in the 1-dimensional case @xcite . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the green s function in compact space may be represented in terms of jacobi theta functions . in section 4 ,",
    "we generalize the method used in solid state physics to show how to obtain the green s function numerically .",
    "this method should be useful in more realistic brane world models .",
    "for flat compact spaces , the green s functions obtained by these two methods agree . in section 5 , we apply the result to brane inflation in the cosmological context .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the slow - roll parameter @xmath3 is too big for the brane - anti - brane scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "the impact of the jellium term in the branes - at - small - angle scenario can be made negligibly small . in this sense , the branes - at - small - angle inflationary scenario remains robust .",
    "section 6 contains discussion .",
    "in non - compact space , the determination of the potential energy ( coulombic or gravitational ) between two charges is well known : we treat one of the charge @xmath19 to be a probe charge , and the potential energy is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath17 is the potential due to charge @xmath18 ( even if @xmath21 ) . here , we argue that this simple ansatz is equally applicable in compact spaces , where @xmath17 includes the contribution of the jellium term .",
    "that is , the potential energy between two charged ( coulombic , ramond - ramond , gravitational or ns - ns ) objects in a compact space will include the same quadratic component due to the jellium term , irrespective of whether the sum of the source charges in the compact space vanishes or not .",
    "consider a compact manifold @xmath22",
    "( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the green s function is given by the poisson equation , [ jeli ] ^2 g(*r * , * r^*)= ( * r*-*r^ * ) - 1/where @xmath24 is the @xmath4-dimensional @xmath25 function and @xmath26 is the volume of the compactified manifold . integrating both sides over the @xmath4-dimensional compact space and using stoke s theorem , we obtain gauss s law . since a compact space has no boundary , this volume integral over @xmath27 vanishes , as does the integral over the rhs of eq.([jeli ] ) .",
    "consider the eigenfunctions @xmath28 of the laplacian operator on the compact manifold with eigenvalues @xmath29    [ eigene ] ^2 u_(*r * ) = u_(*r * ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions satisfy the completeness relation : _",
    "u_(*r*)u_(*r*^ ) = ( * r*-*r*^ ) integrating both sides of eq.([eigene ] ) over @xmath22 , we obtain ( @xmath30 ) , [ intuz ] _ m dv   u _ ( * r * ) = 0 0 in a compact space there is a normalizable zero mode of the laplacian , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "the green s function can be written as : [ blue_function ] g(*r*,*r*^)=_0 note that the zero mode is absent in @xmath33 in eq.([blue_function ] ) , thus avoiding an obvious divergence . using eq.([intuz ] ) and ( [ blue_function ] ) , we have [ intgz ] _ m dv   g(*r * , * r^*)=0    let @xmath2 be the static potential due to a given set of charges @xmath34 ( at @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 , [ phig ] ( * r*)= _ i q_ig(*r * , * r*_i ) using eq.([phig ] ) and ( [ jeli ] ) , the total static energy due to this set of charges @xmath37 is [ tenergy ] v(*r*_k ) = _ m dv ( ) ^2 = -_m",
    "dv   ^2 + = - _ i q_i ( * r*_i ) + _ m dv ( * r * ) using eq.([intgz ] ) and eq.([phig ] ) , we see that the last term in eq.([tenergy ] ) vanishes .",
    "so , irrespective of whether or not the net charge vanishes , [ ue ] v(*r*_k)= - _ i > j q_ig(*r*_i,*r*_j)q_j + constant where the constant comes from the @xmath35-independent self - interaction terms . when applied to the rr interaction , where @xmath38 , we must have @xmath39 in our compact space . for the ns - ns interaction , @xmath34",

    "this effective strength is very small for branes at a small angle .",
    "since the constant term in the potential is linear in the brane tension @xmath47 , @xmath48 can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "this well - known example ( given in ref.@xcite ) illustrates the above result . consider a circle of circumference @xmath49 . for @xmath50 , g(y)= - + - where the constant term may be determined by the @xmath51-function regularization of the divergent green s function @xmath52 of the 1-dimensional lattice , 2 g(y ) = |y| + _",
    "n=1^ |y+nl| + |y - nl| notice that @xmath53 satisfies eq.([intgz ] ) .",
    "let us put a charge @xmath54 at @xmath55 and a second charge @xmath56 at @xmath57 , where @xmath58 so that the total charge in the circle is zero . using eq.([ue ] ) , one finds [ ue1 ] v(y)= q^2g(y ) + = q^2 ( - - ) + where the first term is the linear potential and the quadratic term is due to the jellium effect .",
    "the last term is the self - energy term and is independent of @xmath59 . as we put the charges on top of each other , @xmath60 , as expected .",

    "there is also an arbitrary constant of integration , but the requirement that @xmath2 be independent of @xmath138 yields [ phi3d ] ^(3)(*r*)=_1^(3)(*r * ) + _ 2^(3)(*r * ) - the @xmath138-dependent term comes from the missing zero mode in @xmath162 , as can be seen by differentiating with respect to @xmath138 .",
    "the constant vanishes as @xmath158 , so that eq.([phi3d ] ) recovers eq.([ewald ] ) .",
    "this also satisfies eq.([intgz ] ) . in practice ,",
    "a suitable choice of @xmath138 increases the convergence of the calculation . in condensed matter",
    "a jellium is always used to make the lattice neutral , but a more general term can be easily incorporated into this technique by including the appropriate fourier expansion in @xmath156 .",

    "generally , though , the higher order coefficients @xmath164 will not be small , so it is best to use a numerical fit .      to implement the same procedure in dimensions",

    "in particular , each should converge at least faster than @xmath165 or @xmath166 since the number of points in the sums over the lattice grow as the ( @xmath167 ) power of @xmath168 or @xmath169 .",
