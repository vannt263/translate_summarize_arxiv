    "silicon carbide has long been studied because of its technological potential for electronic devices @xcite . while most semiconductor compounds exhibit only one stable phase at room temperature",
    ", sic possesses many polytypes . of these polytypes , cubic or",
    "@xmath1sic has demonstrated its potential for use in high - temperature , high - frequency and high - power electronic devices .",
    "the lattice parameter of @xmath1sic possesses a lattice mismatch of @xmath420% when compared with the lattice parameters of silicon or diamond .",
    "this has several consequences : first that when @xmath1sic is grown as a film on a si substrate , the interface between the two materials possesses an associated strain field .",
    "second , an unreconstructed si or c - terminated sic surface is under compressive or tensile stress .",
    "this stress is a driving force for significant reconstructions on both surfaces .",
    "depending on the stoichiometry of the @xmath1sic(001 ) surface , a large variety of such reconstructions has been found . for silicon - rich surfaces ( containing more silicon than the si - terminated bulk structure ) , the series of reconstructions ( 3@xmath02 ) , ( 5@xmath02 ) , ...",
    "@xmath52 ) has been observed @xcite , while for less silicon - rich surfaces the @xmath62 ) @xcite or ( 2@xmath01 ) reconstructions are observed @xcite . for c - terminated surfaces ,",
    "the @xmath72 ) reconstruction is favoured @xcite .",
    "it has been found that annealing the highly silicon - rich ( 3@xmath02 ) surface at 1100 k for several minutes leads to the formation of a grating of very long ( @xmath41000  ) , very straight lines at the transition from the ( 3@xmath02 ) to c(4@xmath02 ) surface @xcite , with the separation between the lines of magnitude @xmath46  .",
    "additional heat treatment leads to the removal of this grating and the formation of widely separated atomic lines @xcite , which we refer to as the @xmath52 ) series of reconstructions .",
    "these complex ( @xmath22 ) reconstructions consist of two subunits : the structural elements corresponding to the area between the lines ( believed to be the @xmath62 ) reconstruction @xcite ) , and the structural elements corresponding to the lines themselves .    in stm images of these lines @xcite the bright regions appear to be @xmath49   wide and the separation of these bright features along the line appears to be @xmath4 6  .",
    "the surface lattice vector of the @xmath1sic ( 001 ) surface is 3.08  .",
    "thus it is believed that these lines are formed from the same structural components as the silicon - rich ( 3@xmath02 ) reconstruction , of which there are several models ( see figures  1 - 3 ) : the additional dimer row model ( adrm ) @xcite , the double dimer row model ( ddrm ) @xcite and the two - adlayer asymmetric - dimer model ( taadm ) @xcite .",
    "the adrm has an excess si surface coverage of 1/3 ml ( or one addimer per surface unit cell ) and has an orientation of ( 2@xmath03 ) compared to our other candidate models which have an orientation we term ( 3@xmath02 ) , the ddrm possesses a coverage of 2/3 ml ( or two addimers per surface unit cell ) , and the taadm has a coverage of 1 ml ( or three addimers per surface unit cell ) . in the interests of completeness we also mention the single dimer row model ( sdrm ) which is a unit cell which is a 90@xmath8 rotation of the adrm and which we find has a total energy 2.67 ev higher than the adrm , and so is thermodynamically unfavorable compared to the adrm ; and the two - adlayer - asymmetric rotated dimer model ( taardm ) which is a unit cell which resembles the taadm , but with the top addimer rotated so that it is parallel to the second level ad - dimers , and which we find has a total energy 0.68 ev higher than the taadm and so is thermodynamically unfavorable when compared with the taadm .",
    "we will not consider the sdrm or the taardm further .    in section ii we discuss the various calculational methods used in our simulations , and how we can compare the grand canonical potentials of the various models . in section iii , using _ ab initio _ techniques , we present the structural results that we obtain for the ( 3@xmath02 ) models , the thermodynamic stability of each model , the electronic properties of and how they compare to experiment . in section iv , we perform calculations on the series of ( @xmath22 ) reconstructions modeled by tight - binding , using the thermodynamically favoured ( 3@xmath02 ) model as the parent , and present the details of a change in the structure of the line when @xmath97 .",
    "we then present our conclusions in section v.",
    "we performed the calculations using _ ab initio _ density functional theory using the projector augmented wave method ( paw ) to handle the atomic cores @xcite .",
    "we use the perdew - zunger parameterisation @xcite of the ceperley - alder @xcite treatment of the uniform electron gas .",
    "we solve the kohn - sham equations using the car - parrinello algorithm @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the paw method is to split the all - electron ( ae ) wavefunction into three parts ; @xmath10 @xmath11 is the ae wave function and @xmath12 is a pseudo ( ps ) wavefunction analogous to the wave functions of the pseudopotential method , or the envelope functions of the linear method .",
    "the @xmath13 are a set of ae partial waves within the core region , while the @xmath14 are a set of smooth partial waves which coincide with the corresponding ae partial waves outside the core region .",
    "@xmath15 are projector functions localised within the core region which obey the relation @xmath16 = @xmath17 .    as there are several models for the ( 3@xmath02 ) surface unit cell we modelled all of them , using the surface slab technique with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulation cells were six and ten atomic layers deep ( six layers were used for preliminary checks , ten layers for results quoted here ) ; the bottom two layers were held in their bulk configuration while the other layers were allowed to relax , with the bottom carbon layer passivated with hydrogen atoms . in our calculations we sampled four points of the brillouin zone , corresponding to the @xmath18point , the @xmath19point ( in the [ @xmath2010 ] direction in real space ) , the @xmath21point ( in the [ 110 ] direction in real space ) and the @xmath22point ( see figure  4 ) . for our structural calculations we used a plane - wave cutoff of 20 rydbergs , but for our electronic spectra and total energy calculations we increased the cutoff to 30 rydbergs .",
    "the vacuum spacing between slabs was set to 6.08   .",
    "the convergence of the simulation with respect to vacuum spacing and plane wave cutoff and @xmath23-point sampling was checked .",
    "it was found that increasing the vacuum spacing did not affect the resulting relaxed structure .",
    "the difference between a relaxed cell at a cutoff of 20 rydbergs and 30 rydbergs was negligible , with minor differences in surface dimer length ( @xmath40.10    at most ) and almost identical ad - dimer length ( @xmath4 0.01    difference ) .",
    "dimer buckling was found to be slightly increased for the higher cutoff compared to the case with the lower cutoff ( @xmath4 0.06   increase ) .",
    "we can thus say that our calculations are converged with respect to vacuum spacing and plane - wave cutoff .      tight binding methods ( tb )  @xcite have the advantage of being computationally much less demanding than first - principles methods , while still affording relatively high accuracy .",
    "the disadvantage originates in the fact that the approximations involved are usually of a less controllable nature , and hence are more difficult to improve .",
    "nevertheless , the extreme simplicity and sometimes surprising accuracy of tb methods make them a frequently used tool in computational condensed matter and materials science studies .",
    "we have made use of the tb model known as _ density functional tight binding _",
    "( dftb ) , due to porezag and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "this method goes beyond conventional tb schemes in several ways .",
    "first , an atomic - like basis set is explicitly employed .",
    "because of this , the model that results is non - orthogonal . in empirical tb methods",
    "it is customary to work in terms of an underlying basis set ( normally assumed to be orthogonal ) , but only the matrix elements of the hamiltonian are used , and the basis set is never explicitly constructed . secondly , the model is constructed by directly evaluating the hamiltonian matrix elements within the framework of density functional theory , albeit using a two - center approximation ( i.e. neglecting environment effects ) , while in empirical tb models the matrix elements are adjusted either to empirical or theoretical data . for a detailed description of the model construction procedure",
    ", the reader should consult ref .",
    "@xcite .    in dftb ,",
    "the total energy of the system under study is calculated as follows .",
    "the relative positions of the atoms in the system determine the values of the hamiltonian and overlap matrix elements .",
    "from these , the schrdinger equation for the electronic problem can be obtained in matrix form , and solved by the usual techniques ( for example , by matrix diagonalization ) : @xmath24 here indices _",
    "i _ and _ j _ label atoms , greek indices label basis set functions , and _",
    "n _ labels eigen - states and eigen - values .",
    "once the eigen - value problem  ( [ eq : schroedinger ] ) is solved , the _ band - structure energy _ is calculated : @xmath25 where the sum extends over the occupied eigen - states , and the factor of two accounts for the degeneracy of spin . to complete the total energy of the system a repulsive potential contribution",
    "is added , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the position of atom _ i_. this potential accounts for the core - core repulsion and the double counting of the electron - electron energy implicit in the band - structure term ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we have used a dftb parametrisation consisting of four basis functions ( @xmath28 ) per atom , corresponding to the four valence orbitals of carbon and silicon .",
    "similar models have been used with great success by porezag and coworkers  @xcite to study carbon clusters and hydrocarbons , as well as bulk crystalline phases of carbon , amorphous carbon  @xcite , si and sih clusters  @xcite , crystalline bn  @xcite , and sic structures  @xcite .",
    "we can use the total energies calculated from _ ab initio _ calculations to discover which of the four candidate models possesses the lowest grand canonical potential .",
    "we assume that the formation of the different structures is determined by thermodynamic factors but we can not compare the total energies of different models with different stoichiometries .",
    "a common method of comparing structures is to find the chemical potential @xmath29 for the silicon adatoms and then compare the grand potentials @xcite @xmath30 however , because of the experimental conditions that produce the ( 3@xmath02 ) surface and because sic is a two component system , it is nontrivial to calculate @xmath29 .",
    "nevertheless we can estimate a value for the range of chemical potential that the silicon ad - atoms experience .",
    "we define @xmath31 in terms of @xmath29 by the relation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy of an isolated silicon atom ( -3.80769 hartrees in the paw formalism ) ; @xmath31 is the corresponding value for the cohesive energy per silicon atom in our system .",
    "we must decide what physical / chemical process determines the value of @xmath29 ( and hence @xmath31 ) in our system .",
    "we can make several choices .",
    "we choose to consider the incorporation of si atoms into bulk sic .",
    "@xmath31 would then become the cohesive energy for a si atom in sic .",
    "however this can not be calculated directly , because it is impossible to insert a single si into sic without creating a structural defect of some kind .",
    "we can , though , estimate the maximum range of @xmath29 that the si ad - atoms experience @xcite .",
    "we can write the chemical potential per unit cell of an ideal bulk system of sic as @xmath34 where @xmath29 and @xmath35 are the ( unknown ) contributions from the si and c atoms . in extremely si - rich conditions , @xmath29 approaches the value of bulk si",
    ". we can consider deviations from this bulk value @xmath36=@xmath37 ( with a corresponding definition for @xmath38 ) .",
    "the allowed range is determined by the heat of formation of the sic compound @xmath39 the experimental value of @xmath40 is 0.72 ev @xcite . in a si - rich environment @xmath41 , and therefore @xmath42 . similarly , in a c - rich environment @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this means that furthest deviation the chemical potential of si can make from the value for bulk si is 0.72 ev .",
    "we show our results as a function of @xmath45 over the range from its value for bulk si @xmath46 to the value obtained by assuming that the cohesive energy of sic can be equally divided between the carbon and silicon atoms , we call this value @xmath47 .",
    "it was found from structural calculations that all models we considered were locally stable , with silicon adatoms forming addimers .",
    "all addimers were found to be asymmetric ( apart from the case of the taadm , where the second layer addimers were found to be flat ) .",
    "the structure obtained for the adrm is in agreement with previous _ ab initio _",
    "@xcite , and tight - binding work @xcite , with a strongly bound and asymmetric addimer .",
    "the structure obtained for the taadm is in agreement with previous work @xcite .",
    "there is an alternating arrangement of first layer and second layer addimers as we look along [ @xmath2010 ] , with the top layer addimer strongly bound and asymmetric , and the second level addimers strongly bound and flat .",
    "however , the structure obtained for the ddrm is in disagreement with both previous _ ab initio _",
    "@xcite , and tight - binding @xcite results , as we find that both addimers are buckled and quite strongly bound .",
    "our result corresponds to one of the ddrm models studied previously @xcite ( the lafm - ddrm structure ) .",
    "the other ddrm models were all found to be of higher total energy than this structure , in contradiction with previous work @xcite .",
    "the si atoms of the first si layer of the sic proper were also found to be dimerised in all unit cells , in agreement with previous work @xcite .",
    "table  i provides further information about the equilibrium structure of each model .",
    "we use calculated _ ab initio _ total energies , to find @xmath48 from equation @xmath49 between the various models .",
    "the results presented ( see figure  5 ) are for our most converged simulations ( 30 rydberg cutoff , 4 @xmath23-points sampled ) .",
    "we first of all start off with the assumption that the si adatoms are in equilibrium with the bulk .",
    "as can be seen , all crossover points ( that is the values of @xmath31 for which @xmath48 is equal for two separate models ) are outside the maximum allowable range of @xmath31 as determined by @xmath40 .",
    "we can thus unambiguously apply our calculations of @xmath48 to determine which model is thermodynamically preferred . over the entire range of allowable chemical potentials ,",
    "the taadm model is favored .",
    "our results are in agreement with the previous work of lu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where it is found that the taadm is the thermodynamically preferred model throughout the entire allowable range of @xmath50 . regarding the relative stability of the adrm and ddrm , we agree with other work @xcite , where it is suggested that the adrm is the favoured model , although the taadm is not considered .",
    "we find that the adrm is only favored for @xmath31 which are close to @xmath50 .",
    "but there is no evidence for a ( 2@xmath03 ) reconstruction which is less silicon - rich than the @xmath62 ) reconstruction .",
    "as we find that the c(4@xmath02 ) reconstruction is only preferred over a narrow range of @xmath51 when the adrm is included , ( contrary to observations ) , we conclude that the adrm does not occur in practice , as it would prevent the formation of the c(4@xmath02 ) reconstruction .",
    "we can therefore rule out the adrm .",
    "we have therefore found from our _ ab initio _ calculations of the grand potential that the taadm is preferred over a large range of chemical potential and the other two models can be discounted , with the ddrm found to be never preferred and the adrm only valid for a range of chemical potential which is non - physical .",
    "we can calculate the differences ( the ` dispersion ' ) between the kohn - sham eigenvalues calculated at different points of the brillouin zone , and compare these with recent photoemission experiments performed on the ( 3@xmath02 ) surface @xcite .",
    "our results , and equivalent results in the literature are presented in table  2 .",
    "the magnitude of dispersion in the majority of cases is approximately equal to the magnitude of dispersion measured @xcite ( @xmath40.2ev ) .",
    "the exception is for the ddrm , where we find a large dispersion along @xmath52 .",
    "we attribute this to our modeling of a perfectly ordered periodic ( 3@xmath02 ) surface , whereas the ( 3@xmath02 ) surface has been observed to be almost perfectly disordered @xcite , in the sense that there is no observable correlation between the addimer tilt in one ( 3@xmath02 ) unit cell , and the next ( in either the @xmath03 or @xmath02 direction ) .",
    "the measured dispersion of the surface state bands is @xmath40.2 ev along @xmath53 , with no measured dispersion along @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we find that the only model which reflects this anisotropy of dispersion is the adrm , with the ddrm and the taadm both possessing larger dispersions along @xmath52 and smaller dispersions along @xmath53 , contrary to experiment . as seen in table  ii , there are some disagreements among the different calculations .",
    "we especially highlight the discrepancy between our results and those of lu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for the energetically preferred taadm model .",
    "however we find that the homo state for the taadm exists mostly in the vacuum of the simulation slab , and suggest that as we use plane waves to describe our electron wavefunction , as opposed to the gaussian orbitals used in other work @xcite , our dispersion results more accurately describes the dispersion of the surface state .",
    "we can model the ( @xmath22 ) series of reconstructions by the mixing of two sets of reconstructions , the ( 3@xmath02 ) and the @xmath62 ) .",
    "we use the thermodynamically favoured taadm model as the parent reconstruction of the lines themselves .",
    "we use the favoured mrad model @xcite as the surface between the lines @xcite . due to the large size of the reconstructions , _",
    "ab initio _ methods are inefficient for modelling these surfaces .",
    "we therefore used the non - self - consistent density - functional tight - binding method to simulate these surfaces @xcite .",
    "we performed simulations for @xmath3=3,5,7,9 and 11 sampling both the @xmath18 point and a ( 221 ) @xmath23point mesh generated by the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite .",
    "it was found that structural calculations are converged for this choice of @xmath23point sampling scheme .",
    "all simulation cells are ten atomic layers thick , with the bottom carbon layer terminated with hydrogen to avoid artificial charge transfer .",
    "the results can be neatly summarised in figure  6 .    as can be seen , a comparison of _ ab initio _ and tight - binding simulations for the ( 3@xmath02 ) surface unit cell shows that although the addimer bond length @xmath54 is different in the two cases , with the _ ab initio _ addimer length found to be 2.31  and the tight - binding addimer length found to be 2.62  , we find a similar buckling @xmath55 , ( 0.58  and 0.53   respectively ) .",
    "we find that as we increase the width of the surface unit cell from @xmath3=3 , to @xmath3=5 , the asymmetry and length of the weak addimer @xmath54 remain approximately the same ( this is qualitatively in agreement with previous theoretical work @xcite , wherein it is found that the asymmetry and length of the top ad - dimer remains the same ) .",
    "however , we find that for @xmath97 , the top addimer becomes symmetric and the addimer bond length becomes shorter with a bond length of 2.35  .",
    "this matches stm topographs of the lines , which show that the lines are composed of symmetric units @xcite .",
    "the flat addimer of the ( 7@xmath02 ) unit cell has a shorter bond length than the buckled addimer of the ( 3@xmath02 ) or ( 5@xmath02 ) because there is a stronger @xmath56 bond and a much stronger @xmath57 bond .",
    "the bond angles between the top addimer and the top - adlayer - to - second - adlayer bonds all become @xmath58 , compared to @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the buckled addimer case .",
    "it was also found that if the addimer is buckled and then left to relax in a unit cell where all other atoms are already in their relaxed positions , then the addimer remains buckled , albeit with a higher energy than the flat addimer .",
    "that is , the structural transition may be kinematically limited .",
    "the buckled addimer structure is 0.25 ev higher in total energy than the flat addimer structure ; however we point out that this is less than the average thermal energy of all the surface silicon atoms at room temperature .",
    "the flat and buckled addimer structures could both be accessible to the surface .",
    "analysis of the bond order ( off - diagonal density matrix elements @xmath61 ) between the top adatom and adatoms of the second adlayer show that as the addimer becomes flat this bond becomes much stronger , with larger @xmath56 and @xmath57 components . associated with this stronger bond between top adlayer and second adlayer is the loss of an electron from the top addimer .",
    "this electron is transferred to the surface silicon atoms directly below the addimer as shown in figure  6 .",
    "we also find that coincident with the isolation of the separate lines , there is a change in the homo - lumo ( highest - occupied - molecular - orbital lowest - unoccupied - molecular- orbital ) gap .",
    "analysis of the electronic structure of the unit cell was performed using a ( 551 ) @xmath23point monkhorst - pack net . within our tight - binding formalism , we find that the homo - lumo gap of the ( 3@xmath02 ) unit cell varies from 1.48 ev at the zone centre , to 1.14 ev at the zone boundary . for the ( 7@xmath02 ) unit cell , we find that the homo - lumo gap is decreased by a considerable amount , from 0.87 ev at the zone centre to 0.30 ev at the zone boundary .",
    "we also find that the anisotropy of dispersion of the homo state changes ; for the ( 3@xmath02 ) unit cell the homo state disperses by 0.05 ev along @xmath53 and by 0.43 ev along @xmath52 , while for the ( 7@xmath02 ) unit cell we find that the dispersion of the homo state is 0.43 ev along @xmath53 and 0.05 ev along @xmath52 .",
    "as the homo state is associated with the top addimer , and as this is now more strongly bound to the second level addimers , this means that there there are now strong connections along the line .",
    "therefore the homo state of the isolated lines shows strong quasi - one - dimensional behaviour when compared with the interacting silicon lines that constitute the ( 3@xmath02 ) and ( 5@xmath02 ) reconstructions .",
    "we observe three changes that happen together : that the homo state becomes quasi - one - dimensional in character , that the top adatom of the buckled addimer moves down , and that there is a transfer of an electron from the top adlayer to the top layer of the silicon carbide crystal proper .",
    "we offer one possible rationalisation for this structural transition : that as the lines become separated , the homo state becomes quasi - one - dimensional .",
    "this makes the homo state interact more strongly along the line , which means that there is an extra contribution to the bonds to the addimers of the second layer .",
    "this forces the top adatom closer to the surface , and flattens the buckle of the top addimer . as the dangling bond state rises in energy as the addimer becomes flat",
    ", a state of the top adatom becomes depopulated , and an electron leaves the top addimer , to reside in the silicon atoms of the top layer of the silicon carbide crystal directly below the addimer .",
    "however we are aware that the charge transfer which seems to be involved in this structural transition could be inaccurately treated , as the tight - binding method we use is a non - charge - self - consistent scheme .",
    "we have performed detailed electronic structure calculations on several different models of the silicon - rich ( 3@xmath02 ) reconstruction of cubic silicon carbide .",
    "it was found that the 1 ml taadm model was the preferred model for the ( 3@xmath02 ) reconstruction over the entire range of allowable chemical potential .",
    "our calculated dispersion values for the taadm contradict experiment however , we find that the only model that matches the photoemission data @xcite is the adrm .",
    "the mapping between observed surface states and one electron kohn - sham eigenvalues is not well defined however .",
    "we conclude that the taadm is the theoretically preferred model .",
    "we have also used our dft electronic structure calculations as the basis for a tight - binding analysis of the ( @xmath22 ) series of reconstructions , that is those reconstructions that correspond to the silicon lines observed on the @xmath62 ) surface @xcite .",
    "we find that there is a structural transition associated with a critical value of @xmath3 , where if @xmath97 , then the top addimer of the taadm becomes flat .",
    "we find that the homo - lumo gap associated with the increasing separation of the lines is reduced , so that within the tight - binding formalism the ( @xmath622 ) reconstructions are narrow bandgap semiconductors .",
    "we also find that the homo state associated with the flat addimer is now confined to the line and is strongly dispersed along the line , i.e. it displays quasi - one - dimensional behaviour . our results thus show that the electronic and structural properties of the ( @xmath22 ) series of reconstructions , corresponding to widely separated silicon lines , are very different from the electronic and structural properties of the ( 3@xmath02 ) surface . detailed experimental data on the physical properties of the ( @xmath22 ) series of reconstructions is needed to verify these theoretical results .",
    "this work was supported by the uk engineering and physical sciences research council .",
    "we would like to thank herv ness , john harding , david bowler , marshall stoneham and tony harker for a number of helpful discussions ."
