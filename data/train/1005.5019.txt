    "the study of the behaviour of anisotropic particles has attracted significant attention in recent years . initially the interest arose because they were seen as very simplified models of proteins.@xcite even though important advances have been made using simple isotropic models,@xcite interactions between proteins are highly anisotropic,@xcite and an improved description of the behaviour of proteins can potentially be obtained using models that explicitly incorporate this anisotropy.@xcite for example , anisotropic models can lead to the stabilization of low density crystals,@xcite with packing fractions similar to those typically formed by proteins.@xcite they are also able to reproduce quantitatively the metastable fluid - fluid phase separation of globular proteins,@xcite whereas isotropic models could only reproduce it qualitatively .",
    "in addition it has been suggested that kinetics of protein crystallization could be sensitive to the degree of anisotropy.@xcite in the last few years , a number of experimental groups have developed new methods to produce nanoparticles and colloids with anisotropic shapes or interactions,@xcite and this has led to increased interest in anisotropic particles.@xcite these experimental developments have motivated many theoretical and simulation studies on how these patchy particles would assemble into crystalline structures@xcite or into clusters with a particular geometry.@xcite much of the work in this latter topic has been also aimed at getting a better understanding of the assembly of virus capsids.@xcite one interesting example of the degree of complex behaviour that anisotropic particles can exhibit is provided by one patch particles that mimic janus particles ( colloidal particles whose surface is divided in two areas with different chemical composition)@xcite which have been shown to exhibit simultaneously gas - liquid phase separation and the formation of micelles.@xcite this recent example illustrates the potential richness of the behaviour that anisotropic models can exhibit , and that there is much still to be learnt .    in previous work , we have studied the crystallization behaviour of patchy particles in two and three dimensions and found that the geometry of the patches strongly affects crystallization.@xcite for example , crystallization can be frustrated when the patches are not straightforwardly compatible with a crystalline structure , e.g.  five regularly - arranged patches for two dimensional particles .",
    "however , perhaps more surprising is that even in cases where the symmetry of the particles is compatible with a crystalline structure , there can be strong variations in the crystallization behaviour .",
    "in particular , we found that whereas a simple - cubic structure can be easily obtained by quenching a fluid of six - patch octahedral particles , it is difficult to obtain a diamond structure by quenching a fluid of four - patch tetrahedral particles.@xcite similarly , zhang _ et al .",
    "_ were only able to obtain a diamond crystal from such tetrahedral patchy particles when a crystal seed was inserted in the simulation box or when the model potential included torsional interactions.@xcite by studying the geometry of the clusters formed by the octahedral and tetrahedral model particles , doye _ et al .",
    "_ attributed the different behaviour of the two systems to the frustration between the local order in the fluid and the global crystalline order for the tetrahedral particles.@xcite given the possible applications of a diamond colloidal crystal in photonics due to its predicted optical band gap,@xcite and the growing interest in patchy particles in general , it would be interesting to study in more detail the crystallization behaviour of the tetrahedral patchy particles .    in this work",
    "the phase diagram of model tetrahedral particles is investigated by means of computer simulation . even though there is a very recent study on the phase behaviour of tetrahedral patchy particles,@xcite",
    "the present work differs in the model used to describe patchy particles .",
    "romano _ _ et al.__@xcite used the kern - frenkel ( kf ) model,@xcite in which particles are described as hard spheres with some attractive sites modeled as square wells , whereas in this work particles are modeled using a generalized lennard - jones potential modulated by gaussian functions at the location of the patches.@xcite this model potential ( and modified versions of it ) has been previously used to study crystallization,@xcite phase behaviour@xcite and the self - assembly of clusters of patchy particles with various symmetries.@xcite comparisons between the present work and that of romano _ et al .",
    "_ will allow us to discern the intrinsic behaviour of tetrahedral particles from particular behaviour that arises from the specific shape of the model potential .",
    "anisotropic particles are modeled using a pair potential that consists of a generalized lennard - jones ( lj ) repulsive core and an attractive tail modulated by an angular function that depends on how directly the patches point at each other .",
    "the interaction between two particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 depends on the distance vector between them ( @xmath2 ) and on their orientation ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a generalized @xmath7 lj potential : @xmath8,\\ ] ] and @xmath9 is the distance at which the lj potential passes through zero .",
    "our purpose is to study the phase behaviour for the usual 12 - 6 lj model .",
    "however , we are also interested in investigating the effects of the range of the potential , which can be tuned by modifying the exponents of the generalized lj potential .",
    "although the depth of the potential is independent of the value of @xmath10 , the position of the potential minimum varies and is at @xmath11 .",
    "the phase behaviour of the 20 - 10 model will also be investigated in this work . for this model , the position of the minimum is 1.0718@xmath12 , whereas for the usual 12 - 6 lj potential it is 1.1225@xmath12 .",
    "the generalized lj potential is modulated by the factor @xmath13 , which is a product of gaussian functions that depends on the allignment of the patches with the interparticle vector : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the angle between @xmath16 and patch @xmath17 on particle @xmath0 , and @xmath18 is the patch that minimizes this angle .",
    "thus , @xmath19 when two patches directly point at each other . the parameter @xmath20 is a measure of the width of the patches , with @xmath21 being the full width at half maximum of the gaussian . for computational efficiency , this potential was truncated and shifted at a cutoff distance of @xmath22 .    in this work ,",
    "we study particles with four tetrahedrally - arranged patches with a patch width of @xmath20=0.3 radians . in a previous study of octahedral particles with 6 patches using the 12 - 6 model",
    "it was found that this patch width is sufficiently narrow to stabilize a low density simple - cubic crystal.@xcite therefore , we expect these particles to represent promising candidates for the formation of a diamond crystal at low pressure .    throughout this paper , all quantities will be given in reduced units , i.e.  @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "orientationally - ordered crystal structures for tetrahedral patchy particles : ( a ) diamond , ( b ) bcc and ( c ) fcc .",
    "two views are shown in each case , with the picture on the right corresponding to a rotation of the structure by ( a ) and ( b ) @xmath27 and ( c ) @xmath28 about the @xmath29 axis.,width=321 ]      as mentioned before , the tetrahedral geometry of the particles was chosen in order to explore the possibility that , at sufficiently low temperatures and pressures , the formation of a diamond crystal would be favoured . in the diamond lattice",
    "each of the four patches point directly at one of the four nearest neighbours ( fig .",
    "[ figure_solids](a ) ) .",
    "as the four patches are able to form a `` perfect '' bond ( i.e.with energy @xmath30 ) , the energy will be minimized in this structure .",
    "however , the diamond solid has a very low density and it is expected that a body - centred - cubic ( bcc ) structure ( fig .  [ figure_solids](b ) ) will be competitive with diamond . specifically",
    ", in the diamond crystal there is enough free space to interpenetrate a second diamond lattice displaced with respect to the first one by a vector @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the unit cell parameter of the cubic diamond lattice , and the density of the resulting bcc crystal is exactly twice that of the diamond structure . when the distance between nearest neighbours is equal to @xmath9 , i.e.  when the repulsive cores of the particles touch , then the density of the diamond and bcc crystals are @xmath33=0.6495 and 1.2990 , respectively",
    "however , the energetically - preferred nearest - neighbour distance corresponds to the minimum in the potential , and the corresponding density of the crystals are @xmath33=0.4593 and 0.9186 for the 12 - 6 model and @xmath33=0.5276 and 1.0551 for the 20 - 10 model .",
    "consequently , for both the models that we consider , it is always possible to interpenetrate the two sublattices without any deformation of the two lattices , i.e.  with no energy cost , although there is slightly less room for the sublattices to vibrate in the shorter - ranged model .",
    "this situation is somewhat similar to that found for the octahedral particles , in which case the bcc structure is formed by interpenetrating two simple - cubic lattices.@xcite however , for the octahedral particles the two simple cubic lattices have to be expanded slightly with respect to their ideal densities in order to interpenetrate without the repulsive cores of the particles overlapping , and so there is an associated energy penalty.@xcite    at zero temperature and zero pressure the most stable solid will be that with least potential energy . for the patch width studied in this work",
    "there is a small attractive interaction between the two diamond sublattices in the bcc structure which slightly lowers the energy of the bcc solid with respect to that of the diamond .",
    "therefore , at zero temperature and at zero pressure the bcc solid is the most stable solid .",
    "this represents a difference with the kern - frenkel@xcite model studied by romano _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , for which the bcc and diamond solids exhibit the same energy ( both maximize the number of bonds per particle ) and so they are degenerate at zero temperature and at zero pressure . at zero temperature and pressures above zero , the more stable phase will be that with lower enthalpy .",
    "as the molar volume of the bcc solid is lower than that for diamond , the @xmath34 term is lower for the bcc solid and , therefore , the bcc solid is again more stable than the diamond structure . in summary , for our model , at zero temperature the diamond structure becomes more stable than the bcc solid only at negative pressures . at zero pressure and finite temperatures ,",
    "however , it is probable that the diamond structure has a higher vibrational entropy , because interactions between the two sublattices are likely to reduce the vibrational entropy of the bcc solid , i.e.  the atoms in the bcc solid have less `` room '' to vibrate because of the presence of the other sub - lattice .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the diamond structure could be stabilized if the entropy term , which is expected to be somewhat higher in the diamond structure , overcomes the advantage in the potential energy of the bcc solid .    for completeness the high pressure region of the phase diagram will also be studied .",
    "similar to what has been found for octahedral particles,@xcite it is expected that at high pressures a face - centred - cubic ( fcc ) solid is the most stable phase . for tetrahedral particles",
    "it is not possible to align each of the four patches with a nearest neighbour .",
    "however , an ordered fcc structure ( fcc - o ) can be obtained by starting from the bcc lattice described above and then stretching one of the edges of the unit cell from @xmath32 to @xmath35 so that each one of the four patches will be pointing to four of the twelve nearest neighbours , but the allignment will not be perfect ( fig .",
    "[ figure_solids](c ) ) .",
    "this structure has a somewhat higher energy than the diamond or the bcc lattices .",
    "it is expected to become the stable phase above some given pressure , where this high density structure will be favoured by its lower enthalpy ( the @xmath34 term will compensate for the disadvantage in the potential energy ) .    at high temperatures , where the kinetic energy is high enough to overcome the attractive interactions , it is likely that the ordered fcc will transform into a plastic crystal in which the centers of mass of the particles are arranged in an fcc lattice but where the particles are free to rotate .",
    "the plastic crystal will be denoted fcc - d .",
    "@xmath36 monte carlo ( mc ) simulations were used for both the fluid and the solid phases .",
    "typically about 200000 mc cycles ( plus another 100000 mc cycles for equilibration ) were used for the fluid phase , whereas 50000 mc cycles ( plus 50000 mc cycles for equilibration ) were enough for the solid phases .",
    "each mc cycle consisted of @xmath37 attempts to translate or rotate a particle ( @xmath37 being the number of particles in the system ) plus one attempt to change the volume .",
    "the maximum translational and rotational displacements were adjusted to obtain a 40% acceptance probability and the maximum volume displacement was adjusted to obtain a 30% acceptance probability .",
    "the number of particles used in the simulations was 512 for the diamond crystal , 432 for the bcc lattice , 500 for the fcc solid and 432 for the fluid phase .",
    "these numbers are chosen so that the crystal structures are commensurate with the simulation boxes .",
    "the computation of the phase diagram requires the calculation of free energies .",
    "as the methods used to compute free energies in this work have been previously described in detail,@xcite only a brief summary will be given here .",
    "for the fluid the free energy was calculated by thermodynamic integration with the ideal gas as a reference state.@xcite between 1020 states were used in the integration . for the solid phases we used the recently proposed einstein molecule",
    "approach,@xcite which is a variant of the einstein crystal method of frenkel and ladd.@xcite in this method , the free energy of the solid is calculated by hamiltonian integration with the reference state being an einstein molecule ( i.e.  an einstein crystal in which one of the molecules , e.g.  molecule 1 , does not vibrate ) with the same lattice as the real solid .",
    "as we are considering anisotropic particles , besides the harmonic springs that bind the center of mass of each particle to a lattice position , an orientational field that keeps the particles with the right orientation is also needed .",
    "it is convenient to choose an orientational field with the same symmetry as the model under study.@xcite the orientation of each particle in the reference structure is defined by two unitary vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( non - orthogonal ) parallel to two specified patches . for the tetrahedral particles ( that exhibit t@xmath40 symmetry )",

    "@xmath46 is the angle formed by the closest patch in the instantaneous orientation of molecule @xmath0 and the vector @xmath38 in the reference structure , and @xmath47 is defined analogously .",
    "note that the second sum in eq .",
    "[ field_orient ] runs over all the particles , i.e.  all molecules are allowed to rotate.@xcite the free energy of the reference system and the free energy difference between the reference system and the solid was evaluated by using the procedure described in refs .   and .",
    "once the free energy is known at a given thermodynamic state , the free energy can be computed at other states by thermodynamic integration.@xcite coexistence points were calculated by imposing the conditions of chemical equilibrium , i.e.  equal temperature , pressure and chemical potential .",
    "starting from the coexistence points calculated by free energy calculations , gibbs - duhem integration@xcite with a fourth order runge - kutta algorithm@xcite was used to trace the coexistence lines .",
    "the melting point of the diamond and bcc solids was also calculated by using the direct coexistence method.@xcite we follow the same procedure as that described in ref .  .",
    "in this method , simulations of a fluid - solid interface are performed .",
    "for the fluid - diamond interface , the initial configuration contained 512 solid particles ( i.e.  4@xmath484@xmath484 unit cells ) and 512 fluid particles .",
    "the fluid - bcc interface contained 432 solid particles ( i.e.  6@xmath486@xmath486 unit cells ) and another 432 fluid particles .",
    "finally , in the fluid - fcc - d interface there was a crystalline block of 500 particles ( i.e.  5@xmath485@xmath485 unit cells ) plus another 500 fluid particles .",
    "the interfaces were generated as in ref .  .",
    "the coexistence point was then calculated by performing @xmath36 mc simulations at a given temperature and at different pressures .",
    "monitoring the evolution of the internal energy or the density , it is possible to bracket the coexistence pressure at the simulated temperature . alternatively , at a given pressure , simulations can be performed at various temperatures to bracket the coexistence temperature at that pressure .",
    "let us start with the results for the long - ranged 12 - 6 lj tetrahedral model . before presenting the computed phase diagram",
    ", we first consider the fluid - fluid phase equilibrium . in a previous study of octahedral particles using the same model potential as the one used here",
    ", it was found that for a patch width of @xmath49 0.3 radians fluid - fluid phase separation was metastable with respect to solidification.@xcite as shown in previous work,@xcite the fluid - fluid phase separation moves to lower temperatures as the surface coverage of the patches diminishes . from this result",
    "it follows that , for the same patch width , the fluid - fluid phase separation for the tetrahedral model ( four patches ) occurs at a lower temperature than that of the octahedral model ( six patches ) .",
    "as fluid - fluid phase separation was already metastable for the octahedral model at a patch width of @xmath490.3 radians,@xcite it is likely that it is also metastable for the tetrahedral model .",

    "the important term for understanding the thermal stabilization of the diamond structure is @xmath63 . in the harmonic approximation ,",
    "the vibrational entropy is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the geometric mean vibrational frequency .",
    "note that in a classical statistical mechanics formalism ( as is appropriate for the simulations considered in this work ) , the entropy tends to minus infinity at zero temperature .",
    "however , the difference of entropy between two phases can remain finite .",
    "in particular , it follows that , again in the harmonic approximation , @xmath66 as fig .",
    "[ contributions ] shows , @xmath63 approaches zero as the temperature is decreased .",
    "the vibrational frequencies are related to the curvature of the potential energy surface at the minimum corresponding to the crystal . at this minimum",
    "the two sublattices of the bcc crystal interact only very weakly , and so the vibrational frequencies are essentially the same for the two crystals , except for the three modes corresponding to the displacement of the two sublattices with respect to each other in the bcc crystal .",
    "hence , @xmath67 .",
    "( [ eq : dsvib ] ) also implies that @xmath68 will not vary with temperature if the vibrations are harmonic .",
    "however , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ whalley ] , the variation of the potential energy with temperature deviates from the linearity expected for harmonic vibrations , and it is noticeable that this deviation is more pronounced for the diamond lattice , i.e.  the vibrations in the diamond lattice are more anharmonic . as the magnitude of the vibrations increase with temperature , the presence of another sublattice becomes an increasing constraint on the thermal motion in the bcc crystal .",
    "by contrast , the empty space in the diamond lattice allows the magnitude of the vibrations to increase more rapidly than that for a harmonic system .",
    "it is this greater vibrational entropy that drives the thermal stabilization of the diamond phase .",
    "there is one more subtlety : the increase of @xmath69 with temperature is partially offset by a corresponding decrease in @xmath70 , because the greater vibrational entropy available as the energy increases causes the energy to increase more rapidly than for harmonic vibrations .",
    "this relationship between @xmath63 and @xmath70 is of course inherent in the formulae : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this analysis leaves one question : why is this thermal stabilization of the diamond crystal more pronounced for the shorter - range potential .",
    "firstly , the zero - temperature difference in potential energy between the two crystals is reduced .",
    "secondly , as we noted earlier the density difference between the bcc crystal when at its potential energy minimum and when the repulsive cores start to overlap is smaller for the 20 - 10 model .",
    "hence , the magnitude of the vibrations required for the two sub - lattices to begin to interact significantly is smaller .",
    "the potential effect of this difference is reduced because the magnitude of the bond - stretching vibrations is also reduced for the 20 - 10 model because the potential is stiffer as a function of distance . however , the patch width is the same for the two models and hence the magnitude of the angular vibrations will be similar for the two models , and it is the effect of the reduced `` room '' on the angular vibrations in the bcc crystal that leads to the enhanced entropic stabilization of the diamond structure for the shorter - ranged model .    in summary ,",
    "our results show significant similarities with those of romano _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite firstly , we find that at low pressure , the bcc and diamond crystals have very similar free energies .",
    "secondly , we found that the diamond solid is stabilized as the range of the potential decreases .",
    "however , the main difference with their results is that the region of diamond stability is significantly reduced , and that for a sufficiently long - ranged potential , the diamond crystal is never thermodynamically the most stable phase .",
    "this difference is most likely due to the different shapes of the potential wells for the two models .    in the kf model",
    ", the patches are modeled as square wells , and the flat - bottomed nature of these wells means that , if no bonds are broken ( in the work of vega and monson using the pmw model they indeed found that in both the diamond and bcc solids breaking of bonds was a rare event@xcite ) , the configuration space available to the solid at a given density is independent of temperature .",
    "thus , there is an entropy term associated with the rattling of the molecules in these square wells even at zero temperature .",
    "furthermore , this entropy term will favour the diamond crystal , because of the reduction in the configuration space available to the bcc solid due to interactions between the two sub - lattices .",
    "by contrast , for our patchy lj model , the system becomes localized in the potential energy minimum corresponding to the respective solid at zero temperature , because all vibrations come with a potential energy cost . only as the temperature increases , and hence the amplitude of the vibrational motion increases , does a difference in vibrational entropy favouring diamond",
    "become apparent .",
    "now that the phase diagram for our patchy particles is known , it would also be interesting to perform nucleation studies to investigate which solid structure nucleates from the fluid at different thermodynamic states .",
    "this is by no means a trivial question .",
    "for example , a significant number of systems have been shown to follow ostwald s step rule;@xcite namely , that a fluid does not crystallize in the most thermodynamically stable phase if there is an alternative that is separated from the fluid by a lower free energy barrier .",
    "given the small free energy differences between the bcc and diamond crystals at low pressure , it would not be so surprising if the selection of crystal form was dominated by kinetic effects in this region of the phase diagram .",
    "although a full study of the kinetics of crystallization is beyond the scope of this work , interesting information about the nature of crystal growth from the fluid can be obtained from additional direct coexistence simulations .",
    "firstly , we examine whether a diamond crystal can continue to grow with this structure , even though it is metastable with respect to the bcc solid .",

    "initially the simulation box contained 2000 molecules in the bcc solid ( i.e. , 10@xmath4810@xmath4810 unit cells ) and 2000 molecules in the fluid phase .",
    "molecules that were in the bcc solid in the initial configuration are coloured blue and those that were in the fluid phase in the initial configuration are coloured in red .",
    "as before , the fluid crystallizes in a diamond crystal with some defects.,width=321 ]     final configuration for the bcc - diamond interface for a simulation box containing 864 molecules for the shorted ranged lj 20 - 10 model .",
    "initially the simulation box contained 432 molecules in the bcc solid ( i.e. , 6@xmath486@xmath48 6 unit cells ) and other 432 molecules in the fluid phase .",
    "molecules that were in the bcc solid in the initial configuration are coloured blue and those that were in the fluid phase in the initial configuration are coloured in red.,width=264 ]    we checked that the growth of the diamond crystal from the bcc solid was not an artifact caused by the small size of the system by performing simulations for larger system sizes , which included both enlarging the area of the interface and the distance between the two interfaces in the simulation box . in all these examples",
    "the fluid in contact with the bcc solid crystallized in a diamond crystal ( see figs .",
    "[ lj126_8 ] and [ lj126_10 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we performed simulations for the shorter - ranged 20 - 10 lj model at @xmath59=0.10 and @xmath55=0.05 ( for which bcc is the most stable phase ) and again it is observed that the bcc solid grows into a diamond crystal ( see fig.[lj2010_6 ] ) .",
    "the growth of a bcc solid in contact with the fluid into a diamond crystal is a stochastic process and , therefore , depending on the initial conditions , the diamond crystal can grow following many possible different paths .",
    "even though a detailed analysis of how the diamond crystal grows is beyond the scope of this work , some useful information can be obtained by inspecting the final configuration of our simulations . in all the simulations",
    "performed we observe that one or two incomplete bcc layers grew on the two faces of the bcc solid that were in contact with the fluid ( snapshots are provided in figs.[liq - bcc],[lj126_8],[lj126_10],[lj2010_6 ] ) . as discussed before ,",
    "the vacancies that are left on these two layers are most likely responsible for the growth of a diamond sublattice .",
    "it is observed that the diamond crystal grows from both interfaces . in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ liq - bcc ] the same diamond lattice grew from both interfaces .",
    "however , it is also possible that a different sublattice grows from each interface and an example is provided in fig.[lj126_8 ] . as there is not any reason why the same lattice should grow from the two sublattices ,",
    "there is a 50% probability that they would be the same and 50% probability that they would be different .",
    "it is also observed that the amount of growth from each interface is often different and that when the crystals grown from the two interfaces meet usually some defects appear irrespective of whether the same or a different sublattice has grown from the two interfaces .",
    "these results have important consequences for the formation of a diamond crystal from patchy tetrahedral particles , suggesting that the diamond phase may be able to form even when it is metastable with respect to other crystal structures .",
    "for example , even if the low - pressure nucleation kinetics were to favour the formation of bcc nuclei , these might well then grow into diamond crystals .",
    "furthermore , even if the low - pressure nucleation kinetics were so slow that the system instead formed a glass ( as perhaps suggested by our previous annealing simulations@xcite ) , an alternative pathway might be to use a bcc crystal that was generated at higher pressure as a seed .",
    "the phase diagram of model tetrahedral patchy particles was obtained from free energy calculations . even though the width of the patches was narrow enough for the low - pressure crystal form to be dominated by the energetics of specific patch - patch interactions ,",
    "our results indicate that the diamond crystal is only thermodynamically stable when the range of the potential is below a critical value . at low pressures and finite temperatures ,",
    "the diamond is competitive with a bcc solid , which consists of two interpenetrating diamond lattices . in a diamond lattice",
    ", there is enough empty space to interpenetrate another diamond lattice without repulsive energy between the two sublattices , thus obtaining a bcc crystal .",
    "therefore , both the diamond and the bcc exhibit very similar energies , but the bcc is stabilized over the diamond lattice because of its lower enthalpy ( i.e. , lower value of the @xmath34 term ) . only at finite temperatures can the higher entropy of the diamond crystal make it more stable than the bcc solid .",
    "our results show that the difference of entropy between the bcc and diamond solids increases as the range of the interactions decreases . as a consequence",
    "the diamond solid is only stabilized when the range of the interactions is below some given value .    for the short - ranged model ,",
    "the diamond solid is only stable at low pressures and finite temperatures . on compression",
    "the diamond transforms into the bcc solid .",
    "the rest of the phase diagram is qualitatively similar for the two ranges studied , although there are some quantitative differences .",
    "it is found that , upon compression , the bcc crystal transforms into an ordered fcc crystal , which exhibits a somewhat higher energy because in this case the four patches can not be simultaneously perfectly aligned to four nearest neighbours .",
    "this transition moves to higher pressures as the range of the potential decreases . at high temperatures the fluid freezes into a fcc plastic crystal .",
    "the structure of our phase diagrams show strong similarities to those computed by romano _",
    "for a similar tetrahedral patchy model .",
    "in particular , for both models the diamond structure is stabilized with respect to the bcc solid as the range of the potential is decreased .",
    "however , the differences between the two models  the region of stability for the diamond structure is smaller for our model  also highlight that , as well as the symmetry of the particles , the particular ` shape ' of the interparticle potential can also have a strong effect on the phase behaviour and on the stabilization of the diamond structure .",
    "what type of potential is likely to be representative of the patchy colloids that experimental groups are seeking to produce is not yet clear  it will depend on how the different surfaces of the patchy colloids are functionalized in order to generate selective attractions between the patches .    even though we found that simple anisotropic models can stabilize the diamond solid , the diamond phase is only stable for a very narrow range of pressures .",
    "this behaviour is in contrast with many water models for which ice ic ( diamond structure ) is found to be more stable than ice vii ( bcc structure ) over a wider region of the phase diagram.@xcite these water models consist of a lj at the oxygen site plus two positive point charges on the hydrogens sites and a negative charge whose location depends on the particular model . the stabilization of the diamond structure is related to the penetrability of the water model .",
    "the hydrogen bond distance is about 2.7 , whereas the lj @xmath73 parameter is 3.15 . as a consequence",
    "the interpenetration of a second diamond sublattice has a large energy penalty in water .",
    "if one wants to nucleate a particular crystal from the fluid phase , both kinetic and thermodynamic effects must be considered . for the long - ranged 12 - 6 lj model",
    "we have found that a diamond crystal can be grown by introducing a crystalline seed ( be it of diamond or bcc structure ) into the simulation box .",
    "this is good news for those seeking to produce colloidal diamond using patchy colloids .",
    "it would be interesting to perform nucleation studies on this system to further understand the crystallization behaviour . as seen in previous work ,",
    "the nucleation of a diamond crystal is likely to be a challenging problem , because , besides the bcc solid , the local structure in the liquid frustrates the nucleation of either the diamond or the bcc crystal.@xcite the phase diagram calculated in this work is a necessary precursor to such nucleation studies .    after submitting this manuscript , romano _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite published an extended version of their previous work on the calculation of the phase diagram of tetrahedral particles described with the kf model.@xcite they also propose an explanation for the higher vibrational entropy of the diamond crystal with respect to the bcc solid , which is in line with the discussion in the present manuscript .",
