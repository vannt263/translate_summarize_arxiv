    "topological configurations occur generically in non - abelian gauge theories and are known to be essential for understanding the vacuum structure and hadron properties in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ( for reviews see e.g. topology_vacuum ) .",
    "they have also been shown to play important roles in hot qcd matter ( i.e. quark - gluon plasma ) existing in the early universe and now created in heavy ion collisions @xcite . despite many indirect evidences ,",
    "a direct experimental manifestation of the topological effects has not been achieved and is therefore of great interest .",
    "one salient feature of the topological configurations is the @xmath0- and @xmath1-odd effects they may induce . based on that , it has been suggested @xcite to look for possible occurrence of @xmath0- and @xmath1-odd domains with local strong parity violation for a direct detection of topological effects .",
    "such domains may naturally arise in a heavy ion collision due to the so - called sphaleron transitions in the created hot qcd matter .",
    "in particular , the so called chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) predicts that in the presence of the strong external ( electrodynamic ) magnetic field at the early stage after a ( non - central ) collision , sphaleron transitions induce a separation of negatively and positively charged particles along the direction of the magnetic field which is perpendicular to the reaction plane defined by the impact parameter and the beam axis .",
    "such an out - of - plane charge separation , however , varies its orientation from event to event , either parallel or anti - parallel to the magnetic field ( depending whether the cme is caused by sphaleron or antisphaleron transition ) . as a result",
    "the expectation value of any @xmath0-odd observable vanishes and only the variance of such observable may be detected , making the measurement of cme rather challenging .",
    "recently the star collaboration has published in @xcite measurements of charged particle azimuthal correlations proposed in @xcite as a cme signal , and found interesting patterns partly consistent with cme expectations .",
    "the star data have generated considerable interests and many subsequent works have appeared , proposing alternative explanations fw , ss - sp , sp , asakawa:2010bu , suggesting data interpretations and new observations @xcite , and studying further consequences of cme @xcite .",
    "we start with a discussion of the proposed cme signal as measured by star . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that the cme may be indirectly approached by the measurement of the following two - particle correlation @xmath2where @xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the azimuthal angles of the reaction plane and produced charged particles , respectively . since this observable measures the difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane projected azimuthal correlations , it has been argued that this observable is particularly suited for revealing the cme signal which is an out - of - plane charge separation .",
    "specifically , the cme predicts @xmath6 for opposite sign - pairs and @xmath7 for same - sign pairs .",
    "however , as has been pointed out in @xcite , in non - central collisions the presence of elliptic flow @xcite already differentiates between in- and out - of - plane . as a consequence ,",
    "essentially any two - particle correlation will contribute to the above observable even though the correlations dynamical mechanism may generally be reaction - plane independent .",
    "these so - called `` background '' correlations , need to be well understood theoretically and possibly be determined by independent measurements",
    ". from elliptic flow induced correlations and from the cme have similar centrality trends : both the elliptic flow and the magnetic field , necessary for the cme , increase from central to peripheral collisions . ] the star publication star - p presents data for the correlator @xmath8 together with the reaction plane independent correlator @xmath9 in the midrapidity region for both same- and opposite - sign pairs in @xmath10 and @xmath11 collisions at two energies @xmath12 and @xmath13 gev .",
    "the data are encouraging : at first sight the results for @xmath8 seem to be qualitatively consistent with the cme expectations .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite when taking the correlator @xmath14 into account as well , the interpretation of the data in term of the cme requires almost exact cancellation of the cme and all possible `` background '' correlations . consequently in order to extract a possible signal for the cme , the understanding of these `` background '' correlations becomes crucial at this stage .",
    "one well - known possible source of azimuthal correlation is the conservation of transverse momentum , which has been qualitatively discussed in @xcite and has been suggested to be a significant contribution to the measured observable @xmath8 .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "consider for a moment _ all _ particles in the final state , charged and neutral over all phase - space .",
    "next rewrite the correlator ( [ gam ] ) as ( for simplicity we set @xmath15 here and in the rest of the paper ) @xmath16where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are summed over all particles .",
    "if we further assume that all particles have exactly the same magnitude of transverse momentum @xmath19 , the conservation of transverse momentum implies @xmath20and in consequence one obtains for sufficiently large @xmath21 @xmath22here @xmath23 is the elliptic flow coefficient measured for all produced particles and @xmath21 is the total number of all produced particles ( in full phase space ) .",
    "this contribution to the azimuthal correlations from transverse momentum conservation turns out to be at the order of the data measured by star , and therefore bears interest and importance .",
    "however , the above argument relies on two assumptions which are not realized in the actual measurement .",
    "first , star measures only the charged particles in a small pseudorapidity region @xmath24 , accounting only for about @xmath25 of the total number of produced particles .",
    "second , the magnitude of the transverse momentum is not a constant but rather distributed , more or less according to a thermal distribution .",
    "therefore , a more realistic estimate for the contribution of transverse momentum conservation to the above correlation functions is required .",
    "the influence of momentum conservation on observables in heavy ion collisions has been discussed in the literature in the context of spectra @xcite , elliptic flow bdo , cl and certain two - particle densities @xcite , and corrections of various importance have been established . in the present paper",
    ", we will address the effect of transverse momentum conservation on the correlation functions relevant for the potential measurement of the cme .",
    "to this end we derive the necessary formalism which allows us to quantify the azimuthal correlations due to transverse momentum conservation .    before going into details ,",
    "let us discuss a few qualitative features which are to be expected from transverse momentum conservation , and which will be demonstrated in detail below .",
    "first , transverse momentum conservation introduces a back - to - back correlation for particle pairs , as they tend to balance each other in momentum .",
    "second , the expected correction should scale inversely with total number of particles , as more particles provide more ways to balance the momentum and thus dilute the effect on two - particle correlations .",
    "furthermore the correlation should be stronger in - plane than out - of - plane due to the presence of elliptic flow . as a result",
    "we expect that transverse momentum conservation results in a negative contribution to the observable @xmath8 , which increase with the strength of the elliptic flow , @xmath23 . finally , we note that transverse momentum conservation is `` blind '' to particle charge , leading to identical contributions to same - sign and opposite - sign pair - correlations . because of these features , transverse momentum conservation _ alone _ can not be expected as a full account for the observed charged particle azimuthal correlation patterns .",
    "it should be rather considered as an important background effect that contributes significantly and , therefore , necessitates quantitative studies for establishing any final interpretation of the data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , assuming only transverse momentum conservation , we present analytical calculations of the correlators @xmath8 and @xmath14 . in section",
    "@xmath26 we take into account the star acceptance and compare our results with the available data ( integrated over transverse momentum ) . in section @xmath27 we discuss specific differential observables , such as transverse momentum and rapidity dependent correlations .",
    "our conclusions are listed in the last section , where also some comments are included .",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath21 particles in total produced in a given heavy ion collision event , with individual momenta @xmath28 .",
    "we denote the particles transverse momenta by @xmath29 and their magnitudes by @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath21 particle density @xmath31 ( normalized to unity ) with enforced transverse momentum conservation can be written as @xmath32where @xmath33 is the normalized ( @xmath34 ) single particle distribution .",

    "] we obtain @xmath49as already mentioned , the above correlation function does not distinguish between same- and opposite - sign pairs ( or pairs involving neutral particles ) , as the transverse momentum conservation involves all particles without discrimination on the charge of particles .",

    "let us add that @xmath21 denotes the total number of produced particles ( charged and neutral ) and @xmath63 is the average transverse momentum of the _ measured _ particles .",

    "this may be roughly understood in the following way : if each particle is generated in an independent manner except the constraint from overall transverse momentum conservation , then for each given particle its @xmath19 effectively has a chance of @xmath46 ( in the large @xmath21 limit ) to be balanced by every other particle .",
    "that is equivalent to say that each pair has a back - to - back correlation of strength @xmath46 , which is preserved despite what fraction of particles is selected for measurement .",
    "furthermore , while not changing the order of magnitude of the effect , the details of the @xmath19 and @xmath57 dependence of single particle distribution and @xmath23 may slightly affect the quantitative results .",

    "following similar procedures , we obtain the following result : @xmath71we notice a few interesting features .",

    "if all the produced particles are measured , i.e. @xmath64 , and all have the same magnitude of transverse momentum i.e. @xmath65 , we obtain @xmath75 . *",

[ eq_minus ] ) is the presence of @xmath79 in the former .",
    "therefore , effects of transverse momentum conservation will be much more visible in the correlator @xmath80 .",

    "the star collaboration also presented data for @xmath123 as a function of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "both distributions are very informative : the azimuthal correlation @xmath126 increases roughly linearly with @xmath127 while it depends only weakly on @xmath128 . in @xcite",
    "we showed that such behavior is not inconsistent with the cme and can be understood if we assume that correlated pairs have slightly larger momenta than uncorrelated ones .",
    "as we will show below , a qualitatively similar behaviour can be obtained from transverse momentum conservation . with the two - particle distribution ( [ f_2end ] ) , the @xmath127 differential distribution reads@xmath129and analogously for @xmath125 .",
    "let us first discus the simplified case where @xmath86 is replaced by its average value @xmath23 .",

    "finally let us discus the pseudorapidity dependence of the correlation @xmath36 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath36 on @xmath138 has been measured by star and found to be dominated by @xmath139 , which is consistent with the cme expectation .",
    "it is quite clear that such dependence can not be obtained in the present calculation , as no pseudorapidity dependence appears in the nontrivial part of the two - particle correlation function shown in eq .",
    "( f_2end ) .",
    "consequently , transverse momentum conservation predicts the correlator @xmath36 to be essentially flat as a function of @xmath140 in the midrapidity region except for a very mild dependence due to the slight dependence of @xmath141 and @xmath23 on @xmath57 .",
    "however , here we have assumed that the transverse momentum is balanced over the entire rapidity interval . in an actual heavy ion reaction it is not unreasonable to expect that the transverse momentum is balanced over a shorter rapidity interval .",
    "if this were the case , we would predict not only a stronger rapidity dependence of the signal but also a considerably stronger signal at midrapidity .",
    "therefore , it would be worthwhile to construct and measure an equivalent of the charge balance function @xcite for the transverse momentum .",

    "we have quantitatively investigated the contribution of transverse momentum conservation to the azimuthal correlation observables @xmath142 and @xmath143 measured by the star collaboration as motivated by the possible strong local parity violation and chiral magnetic effect .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "the contribution due to transverse momentum conservation is comparable in magnitude to the prediction of the chiral magnetic effect as well as the data . in the star acceptance",
    "we find this contribution to be approximately equal to @xmath144 , where @xmath23 is the elliptic flow coefficient at midrapidity and @xmath21 is the total number of produced particles ( neutral and charged ) .",
    "this result suggests rather week energy dependence at rhic since @xmath23 and @xmath21 scale similarly with energy . *",
    "taking @xmath145 and @xmath146 where @xmath88 is the number of participants we obtained @xmath147 , which is a factor @xmath97 ( very peripheral  mid - central ) smaller than the experimental data .",
    "thus we may conclude that the transverse momentum conservation alone can not explain the data .",
    "also there is no charge - dependence as opposed to experimental data .",
    "it is however a significant source of background that eventually must be quantified and taken into account if one really wants to extract the possible cme from the present ( and future ) data .",
    "* we have demonstrated that finite acceptance issues , i.e. the facts that particles are measured in a relatively narrow pseudorapidity bin and neutral particles are not detected , do not suppress the effect of transverse momentum conservation on @xmath8 .",
    "* we studied the dependence of @xmath8 vs @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",

    "the dependence on @xmath128 is much weaker @xmath150 with @xmath151 .",

    "we found this contribution to be a factor @xmath99 ( mid - central  very peripheral ) _ larger _ than the experimental data indicating again that the transverse momentum conservation effect is a significant source of background . *",
    "the present calculation is based on the minimal assumption that the transverse momentum is balanced over _ all _ particles ( in the full phase space ) .",
    "thus it is very likely that the calculated contribution to @xmath8 and @xmath14 from the transverse momentum conservation represents rather the lower limit .",
    "should , as it is not reasonable to assume , the transverse momentum be balanced over a finite rapidity interval , we predict not only a stronger effect at midrapidity but also a rapidity dependence of the correlation function @xmath8 and @xmath14 .",

    "<S> we analytically calculate the contribution of transverse momentum conservation to the azimuthal correlations that have been proposed as signals for possible local strong parity violation and recently measured in heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections are of the order of the inverse of the total final state particle multiplicity and thus are of the same order as the observed signal . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections contribute with the same sign to both like - sign and opposite - sign pair correlations . </S>",
    "<S> their dependence on the momentum is in qualitative agreement with the measurements by the star collaboration , while the pseudorapidity dependence differs from the data .    </S>",
