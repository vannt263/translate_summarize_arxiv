    "the transport properties of random media have been a subject of intensive research activity for more than fifty years  @xcite .",
    "the most fascinating aspect of this study is the appearance ( in high - dimensions ) of a metal - insulator phase transition ( mit ) as an external parameter changes . in the metallic phase ,",
    "the eigenstates are extended @xcite and the statistical properties of the spectrum are described well by random matrix theory @xcite . in the localized phase , the levels become uncorrelated leading to a poissonian level spacing distribution @xcite , and the eigenfunctions are exponentially localized @xcite .",
    "the mit where the phase transition from localized to extended states occurs , is characterized by remarkably rich critical properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , the eigenfunctions show strong fluctuations on all length scales and represent multifractal distributions @xcite .",
    "this is one of the most important features at mit and has considerably helped our understanding of different phenomena in mesoscopic systems @xcite . the multifractal structure of the eigenfunctions is usually quantified by studying the size dependence of the so - called participation numbers ( pn ) @xmath6 where @xmath5 is the linear size of the system and @xmath4 are the multifractal dimensions of the eigenfunction @xmath7 . among all the dimensions ,",
    "the correlation dimension @xmath8 plays the most prominent role .",
    "the corresponding pn is roughly equal to the number of non - zero eigenfunction components , and therefore is a good and widely accepted measure of the extension of the states . at the same time , @xmath8 manifest itself in a variety of other physical observables . as examples we mention the conductance distribution in metals @xcite , the statistical properties of the spectrum @xcite , the anomalous spreading of a wave - packet , and the spatial dispersion of the diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "it is therefore highly desirable to have the possibility of measuring the multifractal dimensions @xmath4 , and specifically @xmath8 , directly from an experiment .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge , there is no experimental study of eigenfunction fluctuations at the transition regime @xcite , although in recent years a mit was experimentally accessible in microwave @xcite and optical wave @xcite setups .",
    "the main difficulty is the lack of eigenfunction accessibility in all these experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "new techniques were developed that allow accessibility to various quantities associated with the scattering process . among them",
    "is the wigner delay time @xcite which captures the time - dependent aspects of quantum scattering .",
    "it can be interpreted as the typical time an almost monochromatic wave packet remains in the interaction region .",
    "it is related to the energy derivative of the total phase shift @xmath9 of the scattering matrix @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of channels .",
    "these experimental efforts have promoted the study of wigner delay times to quantities of interest in their own right and attracted a lot of theoretical work . for chaotic systems",
    "many results are known concerning the distribution of wigner delay times @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest has extended to systems showing diffusion @xcite and localization @xcite . at the same time , an intensive activity to understand @xmath13 for systems at critical conditions was undertaken in @xcite .",
    "a possibility of anomalous scaling of inverse moments of @xmath14 with the system size @xmath5 was suggested in @xcite .",
    "specific predictions linking the scaling exponents and the multifractal properties of eigenfunctions of the corresponding closed system were made in @xcite . while in both cases",
    "an anomalous scaling of the inverse moments of delay times was reported , there was a discrepancy in the exact power dictating these scaling laws .",
    "precise reasons for these discrepancies are still not clear ( see though the discussion in @xcite ) and deserve investigation . here",
    "we undertake this task by studying numerically the distribution of wigner delay times at mit for the prototype power - law banded random matrix ( pbrm ) model with one channel attached to it .",
    "we provide clear evidence showing that the inverse moments of wigner delay times @xmath15 scale as @xmath16 where @xmath17 stands for an ensemble average in agreement with the theoretical prediction of @xcite .",
    "however we find that this relation is extremely fragile .",
    "namely we show that it holds for channels attached to a _",
    "typical _ position in the sample . at the same time",
    "we perform a detail analysis of the distribution of phases @xmath0 of the scattering matrix associated with our scattering setup .",
    "we show that @xmath0 is insensitive to the position of the channel while it depends drastically on the band - width @xmath2 which characterize the criticality .",
    "it undergoes a transition towards uniformity as @xmath2 increases .",
    "we note that the theoretical analysis of @xcite applies only for @xmath18 while our numerical investigations extends over the whole @xmath2-range .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the scattering setup and summarize the properties of the corresponding closed system .",
    "section iii discuss the distribution of phases for various bandwidths , coupling strengths , and position of the channel .",
    "in section iv we analyze the statistical properties of delay times .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section v.",
    "the isolated sample is represented by @xmath19 real symmetric matrices whose entries are randomly drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean and a variance depending on the distance of the matrix element from the diagonal @xmath20 where @xmath2 and @xmath21 are parameters . in a straightforward interpretation ,",
    "the pbrm model describes a @xmath22d sample with random long - range hopping .",
    "also , the pbrm ensemble arises as an effective description to a variety of physical systems , such as the quantum fermi accelerator , the scattering by a coulomb center in an integrable billiard , and in billiard systems with non - analytic boundaries .",
    "field - theoretical considerations @xcite and detail numerical investigations @xcite verified that the model undergo a transition at @xmath23 from localized states for @xmath24 to delocalized states for @xmath25 .",
    "this transition shows all the key features of the anderson mit , including multifractality of eigenfunctions and non - trivial spectral statistics at the critical point . at the center of the spectral - band a theoretical estimation for the multifractal dimensions @xmath4 gives @xcite @xmath26^{-1 } \\ & , b \\ll 1 \\nonumber\\\\   1-q(2\\pi b)^{-1 } \\    & , b\\gg 1 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the gamma function .",
    "thus model ( [ pbrm ] ) possesses a line of critical points @xmath28 , where the multifractal dimensions @xmath4 change with @xmath2 .",
    "we turn the isolated system to a scattering one by attaching one semi - infinite single channel lead to it .",
    "the lead is described by a 1d semi - infinite tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath29 using standard methods @xcite one can write the scattering matrix in the form @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian given by @xmath32 here @xmath33 is a @xmath34 vector where @xmath35 is the coupling strength and @xmath36 is the site at which we attach the lead .",
    "all our calculations take place in an energy window close to the band center @xmath37 . the delay time is given by @xcite @xmath38    we will see latter on that the scaling properties of inverse moments of delay times are independent of @xmath35 while they depend drastically on the position @xmath36 . specifically , if @xmath36 is a representative site ( like any site in the bulk of the sample ) where ergodicity of wavefunctions can be assumed , then eq  ( [ mit ] ) applies . instead",
    "if @xmath36 belongs to the boundary ( i.e. @xmath39 or @xmath5 ) , then eq  ( [ mit ] ) does not valid any more .    in our numerical experiments",
    "bellow we used matrices of size varying from @xmath40 up to @xmath41 . for better statistics",
    "a considerable number of different disorder realizations has been used . in all cases we had at least @xmath42 data for statistical processing .",
    "we start our analysis with the distribution @xmath0 of phases of the @xmath43matrix . analytical considerations applied to",
    "the large @xmath18 limit @xcite led to the following expression @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "notice that in the limit of @xmath46 we recover the uniform distribution , where the corresponding setup is associated with perfect coupling of the sample to the leads .",
    "( [ phase ] ) was also derived in the framework of random matrix theory @xcite using the maximum entropy ansatz .",
    "it is interesting that the same expression applies ( see bellow ) in our case as well .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we report our data for various values of @xmath2 and various coupling strengths @xmath35 .",
    "the scattering setup corresponds to one channel attached to the boundary of the sample . for large @xmath2 values",
    ", @xmath0 agrees quite good with the theoretical prediction of eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) while for @xmath47 we observe large deviations for any @xmath35 , even for @xmath48 . for @xmath49 and small values of @xmath2 , two peaks appear around @xmath50 while a gap is created between them . as @xmath2 increases further ,",
    "the two peaks move closer to one another forming one central peak at @xmath50 . in the limit of @xmath51",
    "the distribution becomes a @xmath52function signifying a total reflection at the point where the lead is attached .",
    "similar results ( not reported here ) are found for the case where the lead is attached to the bulk of the sample .",
    "in this section we analyze the distribution of wigner delay times ( [ tauw ] ) .",
    "recent investigations @xcite suggested that inverse moments of @xmath14 scale in an anomalous way with respect to the sample size @xmath5 .",
    "it was further suggested that the scaling exponent is associated with the multifractal dimensions of the eigenfunctions of the corresponding closed system .",
    "this approach allow for an experimental measurement of the fractality of the wavefunctions with scattering techniques . however , these contributions concluded on a different scaling exponent .",
    "it is therefore desirable to investigate the origin of the discrepancy and specify the conditions under which the theoretical expression ( [ mit ] ) is applicable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] we report the delay time distribution @xmath53 for the case where the lead is attached to the bulk of the sample .",
    "similar distributions ( not shown ) are found for the case where the lead is attached to the boundary of the sample .",
    "we report results for various system sizes for bandwidths @xmath54 , 1 , and 10 .",
    "the shape of the distributions for a specific @xmath55value changes with @xmath5 , leading to the conclusion that various moments of the distribution of inverse delay times scale in a different way with the system size . in the insets we concentrate on the scaling of the first inverse moment @xmath56 . a nice scaling is observed . using a least square fitting we can extract the scaling exponent @xmath21 .",
    "= 8.4 cm    our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] where we compare the scaling exponents obtained for the two scattering setups ( channel attached at the boundary and to the bulk ) together with the theoretical expectation ( [ mit ] ) which predicts that in the limit of @xmath57 the scaling exponent @xmath58 . for completeness",
    "we include also the value of @xmath8 numerically extracted from the scaling analysis of eigenvectors of the closed system @xcite .",
    "we observe that eq .",
    "( [ mit ] ) for the @xmath59 valids quite well as long as the channel is connected to the bulk of the sample where the ergodic hypothesis for the statistical properties of the eigenstates of the corresponding closed system holds .",
    "although the theoretical expression ( [ mit ] ) was derived under the assumption of @xmath18 we see that our numerical results for @xmath60 can also be described by eq .",
    "( [ mit ] ) relatively good .",
    "moreover , we find that the scaling relation ( [ mit ] ) persist for any value of @xmath61 in agreement with @xcite . on the contrary , for the case where a channel is attached to the boundary , we observe strong deviations from eq .",
    "( [ mit ] ) .",
    "this is because the boundary is not a representative position and the ergodicity hypothesis as far as the eigenfunctions is concerned is not any more applicable .",
    "= 8.4 cm    = 8.4 cm    let us finally comment on the anomalous scaling behavior of the other moments @xmath15 .",
    "a simple homogeneous fractal would be completely characterized by two of the moments and the respective @xmath62 curve would be a straight line while a non - linearity in @xmath62 would signify a multifractal behavior . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) we report our results for the case with a channel attached to the boundary .",
    "again we see that the numerical data deviates from the theoretical predictions ( [ dq ] ) for any value of @xmath2 . instead , the agreement is quite good for the case where the channel is attached to the bulk of the sample ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4]b ) .",
    "in summary we have studied the distribution of scattering phases @xmath0 and delay times for the power law banded matrix model at criticality . for small bandwidths",
    "@xmath60 the distribution of phases is non - uniform irrespective of the value of @xmath63 , while for large @xmath2 the theoretical prediction of @xcite applies .",
    "we found that the multifractal nature of the eigenfunctions is reflected in the scaling of the inverse moments of wigner delay times @xmath64 with the system size @xmath5 provided that the channel is attached to a _ representative _ position in the sample .",
    "we expect that these results will provide a new method for evaluating @xmath8 ( and in general @xmath4 ) in microwave and light wave experiments where @xmath14 can be extracted even in the presence of weak absorption . at the same time the appearance of the anomalous scaling of @xmath65",
    "can be used as a criterion for detecting mit .",
