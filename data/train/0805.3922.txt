    "the intimate relationship between the short - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlation and superconductivity is one of the most striking features of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "this is followed an experimental fact that the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are mott insulators with the af long - range order ( aflro ) @xcite .",
    "however , when holes or electrons are doped into these mott insulators @xcite , the ground state of the systems is fundamentally altered from a mott insulator with aflro to a superconductor with persistent short - range correlations @xcite .",
    "the evidence for this closed link is provided from the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments @xcite that show the unambiguous presence of the short - range af correlation in cuprate superconductors in the superconducting ( sc ) state .    at zero external magnetic field , the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors exhibits a number of universal features @xcite , where the magnetic excitations form an hourglass - like dispersion centered at the af ordering wave vector @xmath0 $ ] ( in units of inverse lattice constant ) . at the saddle point , the dispersing incommensurate ( ic ) branches merge into a sharp commensurate feature , which is dramatically enhanced upon entering the sc state and commonly referred as the magnetic resonance scattering @xcite . in particular , it has been argued that this commensurate magnetic resonance plays a crucial role for the sc mechanism in cuprate superconductors , since the commensurate magnetic resonance with the magnetic resonance energy scales with the sc transition temperature forming a universal plot for all cuprate superconductors @xcite . to test the connection between the commensurate magnetic resonance phenomenon and sc mechanism , it is desirable to perform further characterization . since a uniform external magnetic field can serve as a weak perturbation helping to probe the nature of the short - range af correlation and superconductivity , therefore the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors in the sc state has been studied experimentally by application of a uniform external magnetic field @xcite . however , there is no a general consensus .",
    "some experimental results show that applying a uniform external magnetic field enhances the amplitude of the ic magnetic scattering already present in the system @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , other experiments indicate that the intensity gain of the ic magnetic scattering is suppressed by application of a uniform external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in particular , the influence of a uniform external magnetic field has been investigated on the resonance scattering peak by using ins technique @xcite .",
    "the early ins measurement @xcite shows that under a modest external magnetic field ( @xmath1 tesla ) , the resonance scattering peak remains almost unaffected , i.e. , although a line broadening occurs without change of the resonance scattering peak amplitude , no shifting of the resonance scattering peak energy is observed .",
    "however , the later ins experiments @xcite show that a modest external magnetic field applied to cuprate superconductors in the sc state yields a very significant reduction in the commensurate magnetic resonance scattering . to the best of our knowledge , there are no explicit microscopic predictions about the effect of a uniform external magnetic field large enough on the magnetic resonance scattering",
    ".    for the case of zero external magnetic field , the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors has been discussed @xcite based on the framework of the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite , and all main features of the ins experiments are reproduced , including the doping and energy dependence of the ic magnetic scattering at both low and high energies and commensurate magnetic resonance at intermediate energy @xcite . in this paper , we study the influence of a uniform external magnetic field on the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors in the sc state along with this line . we calculate explicitly the dynamical spin structure factor of cuprate superconductors under a uniform external magnetic field , and show that the magnetic scattering around low and intermediate energies is dramatically changed with a modest external magnetic field . with increasing the external magnetic field , although the ic magnetic scattering from both low and high energies is rather robust , the commensurate magnetic resonance scattering peak is broadened .",
    "the part of the spin excitation dispersion seems to be an hourglass - like dispersion , which breaks down at the heavily low energy regime .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic formalism is presented in sec .",
    "ii , where we generalize the calculation of the dynamical spin structure factor from the previous zero external magnetic field case @xcite to the present case with a uniform external magnetic field . within this theoretical framework",
    ", we discuss the influence of a uniform external magnetic field on the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors in the sc state in sec .",
    "iii , where we predict that the commensurate magnetic resonance scattering at zero external magnetic field is induced into the ic magnetic resonance scattering by an applied external magnetic field large enough .",
    "finally , we give a summary and discussions in sec .",
    "in cuprate superconductors , the characteristic feature is the presence of the cuo@xmath2 plane @xcite .",
    "it has been shown from arpes experiments that the essential physics of the doped cuo@xmath2 plane is properly accounted by the @xmath3-@xmath4 model on a square lattice @xcite . however , for discussions of the influence of a uniform external magnetic field on the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors in the sc state , the @xmath3-@xmath4 model can be expressed by including the zeeman term as , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath10 are spin operators , @xmath11 is the chemical potential , and @xmath12 is the zeeman magnetic energy , with the lande factor @xmath13 , bohr magneton @xmath14 , and a uniform external magnetic field @xmath15 . this @xmath3-@xmath4 model with a uniform external magnetic field",
    "is subject to an important local constraint @xmath16 to avoid the double occupancy @xcite .",
    "the strong electron correlation in the @xmath3-@xmath4 model manifests itself by this local constraint @xcite , which can be treated properly in analytical calculations within the charge - spin separation ( css ) fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the constrained electron operators are decoupled as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with the spinful fermion operator @xmath19 represents the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself ( charge carrier ) , while the spin operator @xmath20 represents the spin degree of freedom ( spin ) , then the @xmath3-@xmath4 model with a uniform external magnetic field ( 1 ) can be expressed in this css fermion - spin representation as , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the hole doping concentration .",

    "obviously , the incommensurability @xmath99 increases with increasing the external magnetic field . for a better understanding of the influence of a uniform external magnetic field on the resonance scattering , we plot the dynamical spin structure factor @xmath89 in the ( @xmath90 ) plane for @xmath91 and @xmath92 with ( a ) @xmath116 mev ( then the corresponding external magnetic field @xmath117 tesla ) and ( b ) @xmath118 mev ( then the corresponding external magnetic field @xmath119 tesla ) at @xmath120 mev in fig .",

    "when @xmath125 , the external magnetic field is strong enough to induce the ic resonance scattering . on the other hand , when @xmath126 , the commensurate resonance scattering peak is broadened , and remains at the same energy position as the zero external magnetic field case with a comparable amplitude , which is furthermore in qualitative agreement with the ins experiments @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation to the above obtained results can be found from the property of the spin excitation spectrum .",

    "however , as seen from eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) , a modest external magnetic field mainly effects the behavior of the dynamical spin response around low and intermediate energies , and therefore leads to some changes of the dynamical spin response around low and intermediate energies .",
    "this is followed by a fact that the magnitude of the applied uniform external magnetic field is much less than the upper critical magnetic field of cuprate superconductors , i.e. , the zeeman magnetic energy @xmath141 in eqs .",

    "( 6 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) .",
    "this is why there is only a small influence of a modest external magnetic field on the ic magnetic scattering at hight energy .",
    "however , around low and intermediate energies , this small zeeman magnetic energy @xmath143 in eqs .",
    "( 6 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) plays an important role that reduces the range of the ic magnetic scattering at low energy and splits the commensurate resonance peak at zero external magnetic field into the ic resonance peaks , then the ic magnetic resonance scattering appears .",
    "furthermore , at the heavily low energy regime @xmath144 , the magnitude of the zeeman magnetic energy @xmath145 is comparable with these incoming neutron energies , where both incoming lower neutron energy and zeeman magnetic energy dominate the ic magnetic scattering , then the hourglass - like dispersion breaks down .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the influence of a uniform external magnetic field on the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors in the sc state based on the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism .",
    "our results show that the magnetic scattering around low and intermediate energies is dramatically changed with a modest external magnetic field . with increasing the external magnetic field ,",

    "in particular , the part above @xmath111 mev seems to be an hourglass - like dispersion , which breaks down at the heavily low energy regime @xmath112 mev .",
    "the theory also predicts that the commensurate magnetic resonance scattering at zero external magnetic field is induced into the ic magnetic resonance scattering by applying a uniform external magnetic field large enough , which should be verified by further experiments .    from the ins experimental results ,",
    "it is shown that although some of the ic magnetic scattering properties have been observed in the normal state , the magnetic resonance scattering is the main new feature that appears into the sc state @xcite .",
    "in particular , applying a uniform external magnetic field large enough to suppress superconductivity would yield a spectrum identical to that measured at normal state @xcite . incorporating these experimental results",
    ", our present result seems to show that the external magnetic field causes the behavior of the dynamical spin response to become more like that of the normal state .",
    "moreover , in our present discussions , the magnitude of an applied external magnetic field is much less than the upper critical magnetic field for cuprate superconductors as mentioned above , and therefore we believe that both commensurate magnetic resonance scattering at zero external magnetic field and ic magnetic resonance scattering at an applied modest external magnetic field are universal features of cuprate superconductors .",

    "<S> the influence of a uniform external magnetic field on the dynamical spin response of cuprate superconductors in the superconducting state is studied based on the kinetic energy driven superconducting mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the magnetic scattering around low and intermediate energies is dramatically changed with a modest external magnetic field . with increasing the external magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> although the incommensurate magnetic scattering from both low and high energies is rather robust , the commensurate magnetic resonance scattering peak is broadened . </S>",
    "<S> the part of the spin excitation dispersion seems to be an hourglass - like dispersion , which breaks down at the heavily low energy regime . </S>",
    "<S> the theory also predicts that the commensurate resonance scattering at zero external magnetic field is induced into the incommensurate resonance scattering by applying an external magnetic field large enough . </S>"
