    "let @xmath0 be a shift - invariant space in @xmath1 with stable generator @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 nowadays , sampling theory in shift - invariant spaces is a very active research topic ( see , for instance , @xcite and the references therein ) since an appropriate choice for the generator @xmath4 ( for instance , a b - spline ) eliminates most of the problems associated with the classical shannon s sampling theory @xcite .",
    "suppose that a linear time - invariant system @xmath5 is defined on @xmath0 .",
    "under suitable conditions , unser and aldroubi @xcite have found sampling formulas allowing the recovering of any function @xmath6 from the sequence of samples @xmath7 .",
    "concretely , they proved that for any @xmath6 , @xmath8 where the sequence @xmath9 is a riesz basis for @xmath0 .",
    "note that a reconstruction function @xmath10 with compact support implies low computational complexity and avoids truncation errors .",
    "even when the generator @xmath4 has compact support , rarely the same occurs with the reconstruction function @xmath10 in formula .",
    "a way to overcome this difficulty is to use the oversampling technique , i.e , to take samples @xmath11 with a sampling period @xmath12 .",
    "this is the main goal in this paper : assuming that both the generator @xmath4 and @xmath13 have compact support , we study the existence of stable sampling formulas with compactly supported reconstruction functions , which allow us to recover any @xmath6 from the samples @xmath11 , where the sampling period is @xmath14 for some positive integers @xmath15 .",
    "this is done in the light of the generalized sampling theory obtained in @xcite by following an idea of djokovic and vaidyanathan in @xcite .",
    "for the sake of notational simplicity we have assumed that only samples from one linear time - invariant system @xmath5 are avalaible .    in so doing ,",
    "the problem is connected with the search of polynomial left inverses of a certain @xmath16 polynomial matrix @xmath17 intimately related to the sampling problem .",
    "taking advantage of the special structure of the matrix @xmath17 we give a necessary and sufficient condition which involves the matrix pencils theory . concretely",
    ", this condition uses some information contained in the kronecker canonical form of a matrix pencil associated with the matrix @xmath17 . from a practical point of view",
    ", this information can be retrieved from the guptri ( general upper triangular ) form of the matrix pencil .",
    "it is worth to mention that the guptri form can be stably computed .",
    "the mathematical problem of finding a polynomial left inverse of a polynomial matrix @xmath17 has been studied in @xcite by cvetkovi and vetterli in the filter banks setting .",
    "it involves the smith canonical form @xmath18 of the matrix @xmath17 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the smith canonical form of @xmath17 must contain monomials in its diagonal . from a practical point of view",
    ", the smith canonical form has an important drawback : there is not a stable method for its computation .",
    "another algebraic approach is the following ( see , for instance , @xcite ) : assume that @xmath17 is a @xmath16 laurent polynomial matrix ( @xmath15 ) ; whenever the greatest common divisor of all minors of maximum order @xmath19 is a monomial , then its smith canonical form @xmath18 has monomials in its diagonal . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that the @xmath20 minors of order @xmath19 in @xmath17 are polynomials with positive powers in @xmath21 .",
    "invoking euclides algorithm we can obtain @xmath22 polynomials , @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , are the minors of order @xmath19 of @xmath17 and @xmath27 is a monomial .",
    "denote by @xmath28 the adjoint matrix corresponding to the minor @xmath25 and @xmath29 the matrix obtained from @xmath30 by adding @xmath31 zero columns .",
    "thus , @xmath32 , and consequently @xmath33 where @xmath34 could be a laurent polynomial , @xmath26 . from a practical point of view the drawback here is the effective calculation of the @xmath22 minors of @xmath17 whenever @xmath19 becomes larger .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we include the needed preliminaries to understand the raised problem .",
    "the existence of reconstruction functions with compact support depends on the rank , for @xmath35 , of a polynomial matrix @xmath17 , associated with the sampling problem . in section 3 ,",
    "a suitable choice of the sampling period @xmath36 reduces our problem to a matrix pencil problem .",
    "thus , we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of compactly supported reconstruction functions which involves the kronecker canonical form of a singular matrix pencil .",
    "section 4 is devoted to compute a polynomial left inverse of the matrix @xmath17 in the important case where the oversampling rate is minimum .",
    "finally , we briefly remind , as an appendix , the canonical forms alluded in what follows .",
    "from now on , the function @xmath2 is a stable generator for the shift - invariant space @xmath37 i.e. , the sequence @xmath38 is a riesz basis for @xmath0 .",
    "a riesz basis in a separable hilbert space is the image of an orthonormal basis by means of a bounded invertible operator .",
    "recall that the sequence @xmath38 is a riesz basis for @xmath0 if and only if @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the essential infimum of the function @xmath41 its essential supremum ( @xmath42 denotes , as usual , the fourier transform of @xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 and @xmath43 are the optimal riesz bounds @xcite .",
    "we assume throughout the paper that the functions in the shift - invariant space @xmath0 are continuous on @xmath44 .",
    "equivalently , the generator @xmath4 is continuous on @xmath44 and the function @xmath45 is uniformly bounded on @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , any @xmath6 is defined as the pointwise sum @xmath46 on @xmath44 .",
    "besides , @xmath0 is a reproducing kernel hilbert space where convergence in the @xmath1-norm implies pointwise convergence which is uniform on @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the space @xmath0 is the image of @xmath47 by means of the isomorphism @xmath48 which maps the orthonormal basis @xmath49 for @xmath47 onto the riesz basis @xmath50 for @xmath0 .",

    "thus , the generalized sampling theory in @xcite ( see theorem 1 , theorem 2 and its proof ) gives the following sampling result in @xmath0 :    [ sampling1 ] assume that the functions @xmath82 , @xmath69 , defined in belong to @xmath83 ( this is equivalent to @xmath84 ) .",
