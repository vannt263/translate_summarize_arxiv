    "it is well known that an electrical current @xmath0 circulating in a ring with a non - zero resistance @xmath1 is maintained @xmath2 by the fadaday electric field @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath8 is the circumference of the ring ; @xmath9 is the inductance of the ring .",
    "however , the measurements @xcite demonstrate that an electrical current can not decay in spite of @xmath10 and @xmath7 . these mesoscopic quantum phenomena , known as persistent current ,",
    "are observed in a normal metal ring @xcite at temperatures enough low and at temperatures corresponding to the fluctuation region of the superconducting transition @xcite .",
    "the quantum theories @xcite describe these phenomena @xcite as a consequence of the momentum quantization @xmath11 of quantum particles , i.e. particles described by the wave function @xmath12 , and the aharonov - bohm effect , connected with the dependence of the canonical momentum @xmath13 of a charged @xmath14 particle on the magnetic vector potential @xmath15 . the direction and value of the persistent current corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium change periodically with a magnetic flux @xmath16 inside the ring of an area @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 oscillation period corresponds to the flux quantum @xmath19 @xcite .    the persistent current of electrons ( which are fermions with the charge @xmath20 ) observed in a normal metal ring @xcite oscillates with the period @xmath21 and its amplitude can not exceed @xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath23 is the number of one - dimensional channels @xcite and @xmath24 is the current of each channel .",
    "it can be said that the current @xmath24 at @xmath25 is the current of single electron @xmath26 on the fermi level @xmath27 @xcite because the oppositely directed currents of electrons occupying other permitted levels ( 1 ) compensate for each other @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath18 oscillations observed in measurements of real normal metal rings @xcite is appreciably lower than the current of a single electron ( @xmath28 at typical radius @xmath29 and the fermi velocity @xmath30 ) because of electron scattering and non - zero temperature of measurements @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations @xmath18 with the period @xmath31 observed in measurements of a superconducting ring is appreciably higher @xmath32 even near the critical temperature @xmath33 @xcite because all @xmath34 pairs ( bosons with the charge @xmath35 ) in the ring of a macroscopic volume @xmath36 have the same velocity @xmath37 corresponding to the minimum energy @xmath38 .",
    "the quantum theories @xcite describe the quantum oscillations @xmath18 and temperature dependence of their amplitudes both for normal metal @xcite and superconducting @xcite rings .",
    "but these theories do not answer two important questions : `` why does the persistent current not decay in spite of non - zero resistance ? '' and `` could the persistent current induce a persistent voltage in the ring arms of different resistance ? ''",
    "two possible answers to the first question are considered in the paper @xcite . according to the first answer , assumed by the authors of @xcite and @xcite , the persistent current can flow without dissipating energy in spite of non - zero electric resistance .",
    "contrary to this preposterous assumption @xcite the author @xcite emphasized , as far back as 1970 , that weak energy dissipation should not result in the disappearance of the persistent current because this equilibrium phenomenon corresponds to the minimum free energy . according to this second answer",
    "the persistent current observed at non - zero resistance is the brownian motion @xcite similar to the nyquist @xcite ( or johnson @xcite ) equilibrium electric current .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that this second answer rather than the first one agrees with experimental data .",
    "the antithetical answers to the first question also presume opposing answers to the second one .",
    "the authors @xcite use the analogy to stationary electron orbits of an atom as a sole argument for their interpretation of the persistent current as dissipationless .",
    "but the rings used for the observation of the persistent current @xcite basically differ from atoms .",
    "rings have an electric resistance @xmath39 and it is possible to make a ring with different resistance of its arms @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "it is well known that the potential difference @xmath42 is observed in both arms of the ring @xmath43 , @xmath44 when a conventional electric current @xmath45 maintained by the fadaday electric field @xmath46 circulates along the ring circumference @xmath47 .",
    "the sign of the voltage @xmath48 on the arm with smaller resistance @xmath49 is opposite to the @xmath50 sign .",
    "but the current is observed in accordance with the ohm s law @xmath51 and its direction corresponds to the direction of an electric field @xmath52 in both arms , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , due to the non - zero fadaday voltage @xmath55 .",
    "the persistent current , in contrast to the conventional circular current , is observed at @xmath56 and it should be directed opposite to the electric field @xmath57 in one of the arms at @xmath58",
    ". therefore it may seem that no persistent voltage can arise , basing on the idea that no direct electric current can flow against the direct electric field @xmath57 in the ring arm .",
    "but the experimental data @xcite have disproved this .",
    "the persistent current flowing against the electric field @xmath57 is observed in measurements of the little - parks oscillations @xcite .",
    "these oscillations of the resistance observed by w. a. little and r. d. parks as far back as 1962 @xcite is the first experimental evidence of @xmath59 at @xmath10 .",
    "another phenomenon disproving the idea that the persistent current can not flow opposite to the electric field was discovered forty years later @xcite .",
    "the observations @xcite of the dc voltage @xmath60 on the arms of asymmetric rings , the sign and value of which oscillate in magnetic field like the persistent current @xmath61 , give unambiguous evidence that the averaged electric current @xmath61 flows against the dc electric field @xmath62 in one of the arms . in terms of quantum mechanics",
    "these paradoxical phenomena can be described as a consequence of switching between superconducting states with different connectivity of the wave function @xcite .    in order to verify the possibility of persistent voltage existence the amplitude of oscillations @xmath63",
    "should be increased to a measurable value .",
    "in one of the first attempts to observe the persistent current in normal metal rings the authors @xcite measured a magnetization response of an array of 10 million copper rings .",
    "their strategy was to add together many small signals to create a much larger , measurable signal .",
    "this attempt was not quite successful because the persistent current in each normal metal ring has a random sign and therefore the total signal was proportional only to the square root @xmath64 of the number of rings @xmath65 .",
    "in contrast to this case the persistent current in each superconducting ring of identical radius has the same sign at any value of magnetic field @xmath66 .",
    "therefore it can be expected that the persistent voltage of a system of asymmetric superconducting rings connected in series can increase in proportion to the number of rings @xmath65 .",
    "the proportionality @xmath67 implies that the voltage @xmath68 can be made measurable even at very small persistent voltage @xmath69 of a single ring .",
    "for example , in a system of @xmath70 rings the oscillations @xmath68 with an amplitude exceeding the measurable voltage @xmath71 can be observed even at the extremely small persistent voltage value @xmath72 .",
    "our experimental facilities has allowed the fabrication of systems with a much smaller number of asymmetric aluminium rings , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , fig.1 .",
    "the measurements of these systems showed that the number of rings @xmath74 is not sufficient to observe the persistent voltage above the superconducting transition .",
    "nevertheless we could observe oscillations of the dc voltage at temperatures corresponding to the lower part of this transition .",
    "the results of our measurements corroborate the proportionality @xmath75 and allow the estimation of the number @xmath65 required for the observation of persistent voltage above the superconducting transition .",
    "the structures consisting of 110 and 1080 series - connected asymmetric rings were fabricated by the lift - off method by depositing a thin aluminium film @xmath76 thick onto a si substrate .",

    "because of the galvanic connection between the measured sample located at low temperature @xmath104 and the measuring system located at room temperature @xmath105 , a thermal electric noise disturbs the thermodynamic equilibrium of ring system . in this work",
    ", we used a filtration system consisting of low - temperature @xmath106-filters and coaxial resistive twisted pairs with attenuation at high frequencies to reduce this noise and to thermalize samples at low temperatures . owing to the filtration , the frequency of the transmission band of each conductor leading to the sample was equal to @xmath107 , and",
    "the suppression 70 to 80 db was achieved at frequencies in the range @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",

    "were simultaneously digitized by a 16-digit a / d converter with eight differential inputs .",
    "the persistent voltage , i.e. the dc voltage @xmath63 at the thermodynamic equilibrium , may be observed only in the temperature region near @xmath123 corresponding to the resistive transition where @xmath124 because of switching by thermal fluctuations of ring segments between superconducting and normal states .",
    "the resistance of homogeneous one - dimensional superconductor changes from zero @xmath125 to the resistance in the normal state @xmath126 in a narrow interval estimated with the standard scaling factor @xmath127 for the temperature variable @xmath128 , see fig.19 of @xcite and fig.1 @xcite , where @xmath129 is sometimes called the ginzburg number .",
    "a mean free path @xmath130 of the aluminum systems used in our work is short @xmath131 and therefore their resistive transition should be described by a theoretical dependence obtained in the dirty limit , fig.1a @xcite .",
    "according to this dependence the resistance should change , for example , from @xmath132 to @xmath133 in the interval @xmath134 .",
    "the ginzburg number of the one - dimensional aluminum structure used in our work is approximately equal to @xmath135 at its parameters : @xmath136 , the average cross sections of the semi - rings @xmath137 , the thermodynamic critical field @xmath138 and the correlation length @xmath139 @xcite extrapolated to the zero temperature .",
    "our measurements showed that the width of resistive transition of a single ring agrees with the expected value @xmath140 whereas the resistive transition of ring systems is wider .",
    "the latter suggests that these systems are not homogeneous .",
    "the persistent voltage should exponentially decrease above the superconducting transition @xmath141 because the persistent current decrease with temperature increase @xmath142 @xcite . below the transition at @xmath143 the amplitude @xmath144 of the persistent current oscillations @xmath18 increases with temperature decrease @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "the persistent voltage could be expected to exponentially decrease with going away from @xmath123 also at @xmath143 because of an exponential decrease of the resistance calculated in the zero - current limits @xcite , i.e. under equilibrium conditions . according to the relation @xmath146 obtained in @xcite",
    "the resistance of a homogeneous aluminium structure ( with parameters of our structure @xmath147 ) should fall down to @xmath148 at @xmath149 , down to @xmath150 at @xmath151 and so forth .",

    "it increases @xcite and reaches @xmath156 when a non - zero external current @xmath157 exceeds the critical current @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , a non - equilibrium ac current , rather than thermal fluctuations , can switch segments of a one - dimensional superconductor between the superconducting and normal states at @xmath155 when its amplitude exceeds the critical current @xmath159 .",
    "it was discovered that such switching can induce a dc voltage @xmath160 oscillating in magnetic field @xmath66 in superconducting asymmetric rings @xcite and percolating films @xcite .",

    "the observations of the oscillations @xmath167 suggest that the persistent voltage @xmath168 can arise but they can not be interpreted as an unambiguous experimental evidence of this equilibrium phenomena because the dc voltage @xmath60 at @xmath155 was induced by a non - equilibrium noise @xmath169 @xcite or sine current @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "this non - equilibrium phenomenon may be considered as a rectification effect , i.e. the transformation of the ac current power @xmath171 into the power of the dc voltage @xmath172 .",
    "the dc voltage , as well as the average value of the persistent current @xcite , equals zero at @xmath173 , @xmath174 and has a maximum @xmath175 between these values of a magnetic flux , see fig.2 .",

    "the dc voltage @xmath167 is observed at the amplitude of the ac current @xmath190 @xcite when the sine or noise current can switch a ring or its segments to the normal state .",

    "the oscillations @xmath167 appear initially at a high magnetic flux inside the rings , see fig.2 of @xcite and fig.11 of @xcite , because @xmath191 decreases with increasing @xmath193 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath175 of these oscillations is a nonmonotonic function of both ac current amplitude @xmath188 ( at a given temperature @xmath194 ) , see fig.6 of @xcite and fig.12 of @xcite , and temperature ( at a given @xmath188 value ) , see fig.6 of @xcite .",
    "the oscillations @xmath167 are not observed at low amplitudes of ac current , fig.6 of @xcite , fig.12 of @xcite , and low temperatures , fig.6 of @xcite , because the rings can not be switched in the normal state at @xmath195 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath175 decreases down to an immeasurably small value at high temperatures @xmath196 , fig.6 of @xcite , because of a decrease of the persistent current @xcite .",

    "the rectification efficiency @xmath200 allows the estimation of the minimum amplitude @xmath201 of the ac current capable of inducing @xmath167 oscillations with an amplitude @xmath202 , high enough for real observations .",
    "the measurements @xcite have shown that the rectification efficiency of asymmetric aluminium rings is abnormally high in the superconducting state @xmath203 at @xmath204 because of the hysteresis of the current - voltage characteristics in this temperature region . a noise with the amplitude down to @xmath205 could be detected with the help of a 110 ring system ( @xmath93 ) at the measurable voltage @xmath206 and the above value of the rectification efficiency .",
    "but the critical current of this system @xmath207 at @xmath204 is much higher than @xmath208 .",
    "the rectification efficiency decreases at @xmath209 , fig.15 of @xcite , and thus at @xmath210 , fig.2 .",
    "in contrast to the critical current , the value @xmath200 does not fall down to zero at @xmath209 .",
    "therefore it is important that the amplitude @xmath211 of the oscillations @xmath167 induced by ac current of the same amplitude @xmath188 should increase with the number of rings , fig.2 .",
    "both the amplitude @xmath211 and the resistance @xmath212 increase approximately proportionally to the number of rings .",
    "therefore the systems of 110 and 1080 rings have the same maximum rectification efficiency @xmath213 at the same amplitude @xmath214 .",

    "the @xmath167 oscillations with an amplitude to @xmath222 observed in @xcite were due to an uncontrollable noise existing in any real measuring system .",
    "this non - equilibrium noise is a consequence of the galvanic connection between the parts of the measuring system located at low temperature @xmath104 and at room temperature @xmath105 .",
    "additional filtration with the help of low - temperature @xmath106-filters and coaxial resistive twisted pairs reduced the uncontrollable noise .",
    "the diminution of the uncontrollable noise allowed the expansion of the calibration @xmath223 of the ring system as a noise detector @xcite to the lower amplitude @xmath188 , fig.2 . in order to obtain the dependence @xmath223 shown in fig.2 , the maximum @xmath211 of the temperature dependence @xmath224",

    "however there are some factors limiting the frequency of the noise current , both non - equilibrium and equilibrium , capable of inducing of both @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "one of these factors is the time of relaxation to the equilibrium superconducting state .",
    "this time , equal to @xmath257 in the linear approximation , increases near the superconducting transition , limiting the frequency band much stronger in the region where a weak noise current can induce @xmath167 or @xmath168 .",
    "other factors can also contribute to the decrease of the frequency band and consequently the amplitude of the persistent voltage .",
    "nevertheless , the proportionality @xmath242 should allow the detection of the persistent voltage with any amplitude when a system is made with a sufficiently large number of asymmetric superconducting rings .",
    "we assume that the quantum oscillations @xmath167 observed in the 1080 rings , fig.3 , are induced mainly by non - equilibrium noise because of the temperature dependence of the amplitude @xmath224 , fig.4 .",
    "the maximum of the @xmath224 dependence is observed at @xmath219 corresponding to the lower part of the resistive transition @xmath258 whereas the maximum of the persistent voltage @xmath168 amplitude should be expected at @xmath259 corresponding to the middle of the resistive transition @xmath260 .",
    "we could observe the quantum oscillations @xmath167 up to @xmath261 where @xmath262 . however",

    "some rings with lower @xmath265 and @xmath267 may contribute to the resistance @xmath262 whereas other rings with @xmath268 may contribute to the quantum oscillations @xmath167 .",
    "the non - homogeneity of our system can partly explain the decrease of the rectification efficiency @xmath200 with @xmath269 , fig.2 .",
    "a ring @xmath270 with its critical temperature @xmath271 can contribute to the dc voltage @xmath167 only at @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "therefore , all rings can not contribute to the total voltage @xmath167 at any temperature @xmath194 when @xmath274 and our real system of 1080 rings with different @xmath123 could not detect the persistent voltage even if the maximum amplitude of @xmath69 appreciably exceeds @xmath275 .",
    "in summary , we have experimentally studied the possibility to observe the persistent voltage in asymmetric superconducting rings using systems of 110 and 1080 such rings connected in series .",
    "the results of our measurements unambiguously point to the possibility that very weak electric noise can be detected with the help of such systems having a large enough number of asymmetric rings connected in series .",
    "we succeeded in reducing the non - equilibrium noise in the low - temperature part of our measuring system down to a very small power .",
    "nevertheless , the system of 1080 rings could detect this weak noise even in spite of some imperfections of this system : its non - homogeneity , too high critical current of the rings and so on .",
    "our results have corroborated that systems with a larger number of asymmetric rings connected in series can detect a weaker noise down to the equilibrium one .",
    "a possible observation with help of such systems the quantum oscillations of the dc voltage in the temperature region corresponding to the upper part of the resistive transition will be unambiguous evidence of the persistent voltage because non - equilibrium noise can induce a resistance but it can not induce the persistent current .",
    "our results suggest that the persistent voltage can be observed with the help of @xmath276 rings .",
