    "it has long been known that when some fundamental laws of physics that have been well established in labs are applied to the universe as a whole troubles or paradoxes may arise . a famous example that perfectly illustrates the above claim is the application of the second law in thermodynamics to the entire universe , which has led people to propose the idea of heat death for the ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "the heat death hypothesis states that , when time lasts long enough , the universe will reach a thermodynamic equilibrium ( and hence maximum entropy ) state with absolutely uniform temperature and energy , therefore any work process and ordered movement sustained by energy will not be possible any more .",
    "it was first proposed by thomson ( lord kelvin ) and then popularized by helmholtz and rankine @xcite . however , after thomson , planck has put doubt about the heat death by criticizing the definition for the entropy of the universe and has pointed out that such a definition has no meaning ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for comments on the concept of the entropy of the universe ) .",
    "modern investigations on cosmology and gravity have put more doubts on the heat death .",
    "it is well known that structure formation and evolution in the universe is dominantly governed by the law of gravity .",
    "the heat capacity of a gravitationally bound system is negative , so that the temperature of the system increases as it looses energy @xcite .",
    "hence , it appears that the role of gravity is to keep the universe out of thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "einstein s theory of general relativity has led people to believe that the ultimate fate of a massive gravitationally bound system is the formation of black holes .",
    "however , studies on quantum properties of black holes have revealed that black holes are thermodynamic objects and contain a huge amount of entropy proportional to the area of their event horizons @xcite , and black holes evaporate by emitting thermal radiation @xcite . for recent discussions on the entropy and structure formation in the universe based on the concept of gravitational entropy , please refer to @xcite .",
    "although the problem of heat death has not been ultimately addressed yet , the interplay of general relativity and quantum theory has refreshed our understanding about the concept of entropy and may provide a solution .",
    "another historical example for the inconsistency of a fundamental law of physics with a global universe is the so - called neumann - seeliger paradox @xcite . in the 1800s",
    ", @xcite and @xcite independently found that when newton s inverse - square law of gravity was applied to an infinite and static universe with a uniform distribution of matter , one would get that the gravitational field at any position in space had a magnitude of infinity .",
    "the inconsistency can be more easily seen by the following simple argument . for a universe with a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter",
    ", the gravitational field must be vanishing at every space position since otherwise the direction of the gravitational field @xmath0 would specify a preferred direction at that position .",
    "if newton s law of gravity is written in the form of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass density of matter and @xmath3 is the gravitational constant , one immediately sees that it is violated since the left - hand side of the equation is zero but the right - hand side is nonzero .",
    "the same problem is encountered in astrophysics when people consider linear perturbations to a static and uniform system . for a gas of uniform density , pressure , and zero velocity , to the zeroth - order ( i.e. , for the unperturbed state ) the equation of newton s gravity is violated .",
    "astrophysicists steer by this problem by simply ignoring the unperturbed equation for newton s gravity and applying equation ( [ new ] ) only to the perturbed density and the perturbed gravitational field @xcite .",
    "this treatment is usually called the jeans swindle .",
    "the trouble in application of newton s law to the universe as a whole , or to a globally uniform system , is essentially caused by the fact that the entire newton s theory was based on the concept of absolute spacetime . in a universe that is homogeneous and isotropic , at every space position",
    "an object must suffer a zero external force so is an inertial frame . according to newton s first law",
    ", any two inertial frames must be at rest relative to each other , or move to or away from each other with a constant velocity .",
    "however , because of the existence of mass in the universe , any two inertial frames at a distance should accelerate to each other according to newton s law of gravity , unless a positive cosmological constant is introduced .",
    "this paradox constitutes a fundamental and conceptual problem for describing the dynamics of the universe with newton s theory .",
    "the difficulty of newton s law of gravity in application to cosmology completely disappeared after einstein invented the theory of general relativity @xcite and hubble discovered that the universe is expanding @xcite .",
    "in fact , general relativity is the first and the unique widely accepted physical theory that can consistently describe the dynamics of the global universe . in general relativity ,",
    "the usual concept of gravitational field is replaced by that of spacetime curvature : the presence of mass makes spacetime curved and hence affects the motion of objects in the spacetime .",
    "the equivalence between a local gravitational field and the acceleration of a point mass makes it possible to choose a frame at any position in a spacetime ( the local inertial frame ) in which the gravitational field vanishes .",
    "einstein s field equation can describe the dynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic universe without any problem , although it reduces to newton s equation in the limit of weak fields , slow velocity , and small scales @xcite .",
    "so , the neumann - seeliger paradox does not exist in general relativity .",
    "the jeans swindle can also be properly justified in the framework of an expanding universe , at least in principle @xcite .",
    "when maxwell s equations of electromagnetic fields are applied to the universe as a whole , a trouble similar to the neumann - seeliger paradox also arises .",
    "if we replace the @xmath0 on the left - hand side of equation ( [ new ] ) by the electric field @xmath4 and the @xmath5 on the right - hand side by the electric charge density @xmath6 , equation ( [ new ] ) becomes the gauss s law of electromagnetism , i.e. , the first equation in the complete set of maxwell s equations @xmath7 for a homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with a uniformly distributed charge , we have @xmath8 everywhere since otherwise @xmath4 would provide a preferred direction . then gauss s law",
    "is violated , since the right - hand side of equation ( [ cou ] ) is nonzero .",
    "this indicates an inconsistency of maxwell s equations with a homogeneous and isotropic universe containing a net charge . one might object to the ratiocination by the arguments listed below , which we will show not to hold .",
    "the gauss s law in equation ( [ cou ] ) is an equation in a flat spacetime , but the universe is a curved spacetime .",
    "that is true .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "[ fail ] we will show that in the framework of general relativity the above ratiocination also holds and the inconsistency still exists .",
    "in fact , we will see that equation ( [ cou ] ) remains valid in the standard maxwell theory extended to a curved spacetime , if the @xmath9 is interpreted as a covariant derivative operator on a spatial slice of the curved spacetime .",
    "a universe must have a zero total charge then the inconsistency does not exist",
    ". however , there is no known first principle to force the total charge in a universe to be exactly zero .",
    "at least there is yet no such a principle that we know .",
    "in fact , a nonzero total charge can arise from several possibilities , including difference in the magnitude of electron and proton charges , nonvanishing charge of neutrons and neutrinos , and asymmetry of matter and anti - matter .",
    "observational and experimental tests of the charge difference and asymmetry are being persistently carried on by researchers , although positive results have not been obtained yet @xcite .",
    "maxwell s equations determine that the total charge in a universe must be exactly zero .",
    "however , there is no reason to believe that maxwell s equations must be correct on cosmological scales . although gauge invariance is often taken to argue for a massless electromagnetic field , in quantum field theory it is well known that a gauge field can acquire a mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking and the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "so an electromagnetic field equation with a photon mass term is possible .",
    "observational and experimental limit on the photon mass are being actively pursued by many researchers ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the real universe is not precisely homogeneous and isotropic hence the above argument does not apply .",
    "if one considers linear perturbations to a homogeneous and isotropic universe with a uniform distribution of charge , similar to the case of linear perturbations to a static and uniform astrophysical system studied by jeans one may get the correct first - order perturbed maxwell equation by the jeans swindle .",
    "however , the zeroth - order maxwell equation remains unsolved .",
    "in addition , as will be shown latter in this paper , in a closed universe with a nonzero charge the maxwell equation always fails regardless of the symmetry of the spacetime and the distribution of charge .",
    "the inconsistency problem of maxwell s equations in application to a homogeneous and isotropic universe was already encountered by @xcite in 1959 , when they explored the physical consequences of a general excess of charge .",
    "they proposed that the observed expansion of the universe is caused by the repulsive force arising from a uniformly distributed net charge due to a tiny difference in the magnitude of electron and proton charges .",
    "they found that maxwell s equations must be modified to be consistent with the model of a steady de  sitter universe , and a steady creation of charge is required ( see the comment by @xcite and the response by @xcite ) .",
    "however , as @xcite correctly pointed out , in a homogeneous and isotropic universe the electric field must be vanishing as forced by the symmetry of the spacetime , hence there can not exist a repulsive electromagnetic force .",
    "more recent discussions on a charged universe and notes on the inconsistency with maxwell s equations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein .    in this paper , the trouble and paradox arising from application of maxwell s equations to a homogeneous and isotropic universe with a net charge are presented and proved with a rigor analysis in the frame work of general relativity .",
    "they are also generalized to a more general case : in a closed universe or spacetime ( i.e. , the spatial section of the spacetime is a three - dimensional compact manifold ) with a nonzero net charge , maxwell s equations always fail without any requirement on the symmetry of spacetime and of the charge distribution .",
    "then , we investigate how to address the troubles and paradoxes by considering modifications to maxwell s equations .",
    "first , we show that an electromagnetic field equation with a photon mass term ( i.e. , the proca equation ) can address the paradoxes .",
    "although spontaneous symmetry breaking and the higgs mechanism can naturally generate a photon mass term in the electromagnetic field equation , we argue that it is not the ultimate solution since the photon mass disappears when the symmetry is restored .",
    "maxwell s equations with a native photon mass term is not favored because they introduce a new and unusually small dimensional parameter ( a photon mass ) .",
    "then , we consider to modify maxwell s equations in a more fundamental way by introducing to the field equation a term which couples the electromagnetic field potential vector to the ricci curvature tensor of the spacetime .",
    "this is more attractive than introducing a photon mass term , since it does not introduce any new dimensional parameter . in a ricci - flat spacetime , including the flat spacetime as a special case , the curvature - coupled term disappears and the electromagnetic field equation returns to the maxwell equation .",
    "this means that in a ricci - flat spacetime gauge invariance is restored .",
    "since a non - empty universe must not be ricci - flat , the paradoxes can be addressed by the inclusion of a curvature - coupled term in the electromagnetic field equation .",
    "if there is a cosmological constant in the universe , the curvature - coupled term in the electromagnetic field equation implies a photon mass determined by the cosmological constant . in this sense",
    "we can say that the new electromagnetic field equation implies the proca equation .    besides the above mentioned inconsistency problem of the standard maxwell equation in application to a universe as a whole",
    ", we have a stronger motivation for inclusion of a curvature - coupled term in the electromagnetic field equation . in general relativity , a law of physics in a flat spacetime ( except the law of gravity , of course )",
    "is usually generalized to a curved spacetime by the `` minimal substitution rule '' .",
    "that is , in the law of physics , the minkowski metric tensor is replaced by the general metric tensor in the curved spacetime , and the ordinary derivative operator is replaced by the covariant derivative operator associated with the general metric tensor @xcite .",
    "there is a well - known ambiguity in this rule . if the law of physics contains second - order derivative operators acting on a vector or a tensor , the order of covariant derivative operators matters in a curved spacetime . in a curved spacetime , when a second - order derivative operator acts on a vector or a tensor , exchange of the order of derivative operators causes the presence of the riemann curvature tensor in the equation .",
    "because of this ambiguity in the `` minimal substitution rule '' , generalization of a law of physics in a curved spacetime is determined only up to addition of a term coupled to the spacetime curvature .",
    "hence , it is natural to consider an electromagnetic field equation with a curvature - coupled term , since the field equation contains second - order derivatives of the potential vector .",
    "the `` minimal substitution rule '' is essentially reflection of the principle of equivalence , which states that at any point in a spacetime it is possible to choose a free - fall frame where in a sufficiently small region the law of physics takes the form as in a flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "the critical point in the statement of the principle of equivalence is that the region in the question must be sufficiently small : it must have a size much smaller than the radius of the spacetime curvature , so that any term in the law of physics inherently coupled to the spacetime curvature can be ignored . therefore , the presence of a term coupled to the spacetime curvature in the law of physics does not violate the principle of equivalence .",
    "such a term can not be recovered by the `` minimal substitution rule '' , since it does not show up in a flat spacetime . in a region that is not small",
    "compared to the curvature radius of the spacetime , the principle of equivalence breaks down and the effect of a curvature - coupled term can be important . for the case of electromagnetic fields ,",
    "the presence of a curvature - coupled term in the field equation can represent interaction of electromagnetic fields with the spacetime curvature .",
    "in fact , when the standard maxwell equation in a curved spacetime is expressed as a second - order differential equation of the potential vector ( i.e. , as a wave equation ) a curvature - coupled term also appears @xcite , whose effects have been studied in @xcite .    in the paper",
    "we also discuss some consequences of the modified field equations , including the time delay in propagation of photons with different energy , effects on the statistical mechanics of photons , and constraint on the charge excess in the universe and the difference in the magnitude of electron and proton charges .",
    "we also investigate the testability of the new electromagnetic field equation with a curvature - coupled term .",
    "we find that , the effect of the curvature - coupled term can be detectable in an astrophysical environment with a high mass density , or in the early universe when radiation drives the dynamics of cosmic expansion .    throughout the paper , we use the geometrized and planck units with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the speed of light , and",
    "@xmath12 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "however , in a few places the units are restored to get the magnitude of physical quantities .",
    "as a physical law except the gravitational field equation in a flat spacetime is transplanted to a general curved spacetime , one usually adopts the `` minimal substitution rule '' : simply replacing the minkowski metric @xmath13 appearing in the law by the general metric @xmath14 , and the derivative operator @xmath15 associated with @xmath13 by the derivative operator @xmath16 associated with @xmath14 . with this minimal substitution approach , maxwell s equations in a curved spacetime",

    "we call it _ type ii paradox_.    for a universe with a homogeneous and isotropic distribution of matter , which is considered to be consistent in high precision with all modern observations on our universe , we expect that the electromagnetic field must vanish everywhere . otherwise , the electric field or the magnetic field will provide a preferred spatial direction at a position in the universe , which conflicts with the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic ( i.e. , the so - called _ cosmological principle _ @xcite )",
    ". then we must have @xmath21 , and by equation ( [ meq0a ] ) , @xmath22 everywhere in the universe .",
    "this immediately implies that the inhomogeneous maxwell equation ( [ meq0a ] ) can not describe a homogeneous and isotropic universe with a uniformly distributed net charge .",
    "the above statement can be more clearly seen if the maxwell equation ( [ meq0a ] ) is converted to the form of gauss s law .",
    "to do so , consider an observer comoving with the expansion of the universe with a 4-velocity @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the cosmic time .",
    "the electric field and the magnetic field measured by the observer are related to the anti - symmetric tensor @xmath19 by @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , where @xmath27 is the totally anti - symmetric tensor of the positively oriented volume element associated with the metric @xmath14 .",

    "because of the very weak interaction of longitudinal photons with matter , approaching to a statistical equilibrium state of longitudinal photons in a cavity is extremely slow , with a time - scale comparable to the age of the universe @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "the practical impossibility for longitudinal photons to get equally partitioned with transverse photons in energy is due to the very large skin depth of longitudinal photons compared to that of transverse photons ( with a ratio @xmath244 ) @xcite .",
    "so , when @xmath206 , we expect that for radiation containing both transverse and longitudinal photons , in the equilibrium state transverse photons have an energy spectrum determined by equation ( [ pl_law ] ) with @xmath205 , and the spectrum of longitudinal photons should be jointly determined by the spectrum of transverse photons and the power ratio relation given by equation ( [ pr ] ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath209 , the energy spectrum of longitudinal photons should be @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the energy spectrum of transverse photons ( eq .  [ pl_law ] ) .",

    ", the dark electromagnetic energy may play a very important role .",
    "based on convincing arguments we have verified that maxwell s equations cause troubles and paradoxes as they are applied to the universe as a whole .",
    "maxwell s equations can not describe the electrodynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic universe with a uniformly distributed net charge , since in a homogeneous and isotropic universe the electromagnetic field must be vanishing everywhere ( type i paradox ) . for a closed universe ( i.e. , a universe with a compact spatial section )",
    ", maxwell s equations always fail if the total charge in the universe is nonzero , without any requirement on spacetime symmetry and charge distribution ( type ii paradox ) .",
    "we consider this issue as a fundamental flaw in maxwell s equations .",
    "we have investigated the possibilities for getting rid of the paradoxes by modifying maxwell s equations .",
    "although an electromagnetic field equation containing a photon mass term ( i.e. , the proca equation ) can address the problem , the origin of the photon mass term itself need be explained . therefore we have considered an electromagnetic field equation with a curvature - coupled term , i.e. , the field equation ( [ meq2 ] ) .",
    "the new field equation can also address the paradoxes and has the following advantages over the proca equation :    1 .",
    "unlike the proca equation , the new field equation does not introduce a new dimensional parameter . in the proca equation",
    "a photon mass is introduced as a fundamental constant . to be consistent with modern experiments and observations ,",
    "the photon mass has to be incredibly small . in equation ( [ meq2 ] )",
    ", the @xmath123 is a dimensionless constant of order unity .",
    "2 .   in a flat or ricci - flat spacetime",
    ", the new field equation returns to the maxwell equation and gauge invariance is restored . in the proca equation ,",
    "the photon mass term is always there , and gauge invariance is always violated ( though with introduction of a scalar field the gauge invariance can be recovered in the underlying theory ) .",
    "3 .   in a spacetime with a cosmological constant ,",
    "the curvature - coupled term in the new field equation contains a photon mass term , where the photon mass is determined by the cosmological constant . in this sense ,",
    "the new field equation implies the proca equation and hence is more fundamental than the proca equation .",
    "4 .   the new field equation has a strong motivation from the `` minimal substitution rule '' , as discussed in details in sec .",
    "[ der_ccm ] .",
    "it can naturally arise from the maxwell equation when the maxwell equation is generalized to a curved spacetime with the `` minimal substitution rule '' .",
    "the proca equation has no similar motivation , unless the photon mass term is interpreted as arising from a more fundamental theory .",
    "the proca equation may never be testable , if the presumed photon mass is incredibly small .",
    "the new field equation contains a curvature - coupled term , whose effect is determined by the strength of the ricci tensor . in a spacetime region that is strongly curved , the effect can be important and measurable .",
    "so , the new field equation ( [ meq2 ] ) is testable .",
    "we have discussed some consequences of the modified electromagnetic field equations and the testability of the new field equation ( [ meq2 ] ) .",
    "although in normal conditions the effect of a photon mass is hardly noticeable , a couple of places have been identified where the effect of the curvature - coupled term in the new field equation and the lagrangian can be detectable .",
    "the places include the neighbor and interior of neutron stars , and the early universe .",
    "due to the high mass density present inside a neutron star , a pseudo - charge current arising from the curvature - coupled term can affect the structure of the magnetic field of a neutron star .",
    "in the early time when the universe is small , the curvature - coupled term in the electromagnetic field equation affects all the electromagnetic processes on scales comparable to the curvature radius of the universe .",
    "the dark electromagnetic energy associated with the curvature - coupled term in the lagrangian may also play an important role in driving the expansion of the universe .    in summary , to address the inconsistency problem arising from application of the maxwell equation to a universe with a net charge ,",
    "we have proposed and investigated a new electromagnetic field equation ( eq .  [ meq2 ] ) .",
    "the new field equation is strongly motivated by consideration of generalization of the maxwell equation in a flat spacetime to a curved spacetime , and is testable in a strongly curved spacetime region and in the early epoch of the universe .",
