    "recent trends in the field of spintronics@xcite exploit the possibility of controlling electron spins by purely electrical means without using magnetic materials,@xcite which is at the heart of the conceptual proposal of the datta - das spin field - effect transistor.@xcite key to this possibility is the rashba spin - orbit ( so ) interaction@xcite appearing due to structure inversion asymmetry of materials and which has been shown to be tuned by gate voltages in semiconductor heterostructures.@xcite    although the main interest in the study of rsoc has been on its ability of generating and controlling spin polarized currents , another consequence of the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom induced by the rsoc is a flow of spins transversal to the flow of charge which is known as the spin - hall effect.@xcite if transport takes place along a planar strip , the spin - hall effect leads to a spin accumulation with opposite projection on both edges of the strip.@xcite this has been experimentally observed.@xcite hence , the spin - hall effect provides a real - space separation between up and down spin electrons , like two ferromagnets with opposite polarizations , thus enhancing the metallic state and its conductance , and these features could also be employed in spintronics devices .",
    "since most devices and experiments about rsoc have involved semiconductors , electron correlations have mostly not been included so far in theoretical models .",
    "however , there are some systems which have been recently considered in this field where such correlations may play an important role . in the first place",
    ", rsoc has been observed in oxide heterostructures.@xcite important effects of a rsoc have been experimentally observed in other transition metal oxides , particularly the iridates where the relevant degrees of freedom are the 5d electrons on the ir@xmath2 ions , and where strong correlation effects are expected.@xcite it should be also taken into account that correlation effects become increasingly important in systems with low spatial dimensions .",
    "interesting crossovers have been reported when moving from two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems to quantum wires.@xcite in this sense , spin - orbit effects , predominantly of the rashba type have been studied in quantum wires.@xcite the presence of rsoc in graphene and carbon nanotubes has been pointed out@xcite and in fact a theoretical study with up to two interacting electrons has been done on a nanotube quantum dot.@xcite    in this work , an attempt of studying the interplay between electron correlations and rsoc will be performed by considering a hubbard model with a rashba soc . during the last two decades",
    "it has been realized the difficulties of tackling electron correlations theoretically . in studies of rsoc ,",
    "electron correlations have been included only locally regarding quantum dots@xcite or on effective onedimensional ( 1d ) systems using tomonaga - luttinger liquid approach@xcite and conformal field theory.@xcite for this reason , in the present work a two - leg ladder , which may be the narrowest quasi-1d geometry on which a spin - hall effect could take place will be considered .",
    "the hubbard - rashba model on a two - leg ladder is suitable for treatment using essentially exact , unbiased , computational techniques , which have been enormously valuable in the field of strongly correlated electron systems . particularly for mesoscopic systems ,",
    "the full quantum many - body interplay between different terms of the hamiltonian can be reliably captured .",
    "there are many compounds that contain two - leg ladder structures such as cuprates@xcite , vanadates@xcite , iron chalcogenides@xcite , and other organic and inorganic compounds , although so far the presence of a soc has not been reported on such materials .",
    "it should be also stressed that a hubbard model in a two - leg ladder has been proposed for carbon nanotubes.@xcite then , the main goal is to determine and understand the behavior of the spin accumulation as a function of the rsoc and the hubbard repulsion @xmath1 .",
    "the interplay between rsoc and @xmath1 with respect to a possible metal - insulator transition@xcite will not be discussed in the present work .",

    "now , once a @xmath4-hopping has occurred , creating a doubly - occupied site and leaving behind an empty site , a @xmath0-hopping is now possible from the doubly - occupied site to the empty one .",
    "hence the spin - flipping hopping takes place in a direction _ opposite _ to the spin - conserving one thus possibly explaining the observed change of sign of the spin - flipping current .",
    "to summarize , we have considered perhaps the simplest system where some features associated to rashba spin - orbit coupling can be observed.@xcite this two - leg ladder system is suitable to be studied by unbiased , essentially exact , computational techniques , which allow to consider electron correlations on an equal foot with spin - conserving and spin - flipping hoppings . at",

    "the spin - flipping current is suppressed and it becomes negative for large @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while spin accumulation is enhanced .",

    "the present approach could be extended to wider strips which could in principle be studied by dmrg , and also by variational and diffusion monte carlo ( plus a fixed - node approximation ) , and to different electron fillings .",
    "in addition , some subtle and so far controversial properties , such as spin currents , could be studied numerically on this class of strips including electron correlations .",
