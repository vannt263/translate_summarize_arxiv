    "precision data are becoming available for hard scattering processes whose description requires knowledge of off - diagonal ( or so - called skewed ) parton distributions . particularly relevant processes are the diffractive production of vector mesons and of high @xmath8 jets in high energy electron - proton collisions",
    ".    we shall use the off - forward  distributions @xmath9 with support @xmath10 introduced by ji @xcite , with the minor difference that the gluon @xmath11 .",
    "they depend on the momentum fractions @xmath12 carried by the emitted and absorbed partons at each scale @xmath13 and on the momentum transfer variable @xmath14 , see fig .  1 . the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 do not change as we evolve the parton distributions up in the scale @xmath13 .",
    "that is @xmath15 and @xmath1 lie outside the evolution . in the limit @xmath17 the distributions reduce to the conventional diagonal distributions [ eq : aa ] h_q ( x , 0 ) & = & \\ {    c q ( x ) x > 0 + - |q ( - x ) x < 0    . + & & + h_g ( x , 0 ) & = & x g ( x )",
    ". detailed reviews of off - diagonal distributions can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is usual to anticipate that the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath18 is controlled by the non - perturbative starting ( input ) distribution at some low scale @xmath19 .",
    "however here we wish to explore the possibility that , in the small @xmath20 region , the skewed  off - diagonal behaviour comes mainly from the evolution .",
    "indeed we expect this to be the case . at each step of the evolution",
    "the momentum fraction carried by parton @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) decreases .",
    "so when the evolution length is sufficiently large ( i.e.  @xmath23 ) , the important values of @xmath24 of the input @xmath25 ) , which control the behaviour in the @xmath26 domain at the high scale @xmath27 , will satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "clearly we can neglect the @xmath1 dependence in the @xmath29 region and start evolving from purely diagonal partons with @xmath30 .    here",
    "we demonstrate how , in the phenomenologically important small @xmath1 region ( for @xmath31 ) , the off - diagonal distributions are determined unambiguously in terms of the small @xmath0 behaviour of the ( conventional ) diagonal partons which is known from experiment .",
    "we therefore have the attractive possibility to include data described by off - diagonal distributions in a global parton analysis to better constrain the small @xmath0 behaviour of the diagonal distributions .",
    "in terms of the operator product expansion ( ope ) the evolution of the off - diagonal distributions may be viewed as the renormalisation of the matrix elements @xmath32 of the conformal ( ohrndorf @xcite ) operators , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the momenta of the incoming and outgoing protons . for the quark ,",
    "the leading twist operator @xmath35 is of the form [ eq : a1 ] _",

    "[ eq : a8 ] o_n ( q^2 ) = o_n ( q_0 ^ 2 ) ( ) ^_n with the same anomalous dimension @xmath45 as in the diagonal case .",
    "the problem of how to restore the analytic off - diagonal distribution @xmath46 from knowledge of its conformal moments @xmath47 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) has been solved recently by shuvaev @xcite .",
    "the prescription is as follows .",
    "we first calculate an auxiliary function [ eq : a9 ] f ( x^ , ; t ) f ( x^ ) = ( x^)^-n o_n ( ) /r_n ( 1,1 ) using a simple mellin transform , where for simplicity of presentation we shall omit the arguments @xmath48 and @xmath13 of @xmath49 .",
    "next we perform the convolution [ eq : a10 ] h ( x , ) = _",
    "-1 ^ 1 dx^ ( x , ; x^ ) f ( x^ ) , where , for quarks , the kernel is given by [ eq : a11 ] k_q ( x , ; x^ ) = - _ 0 ^ 1 ds ( 1 - y(s ) x^)^-3/2 with [ eq : a12 ] y ( s ) = .    to gain insight into the shuvaev prescription we repeat that",
    ", from a theoretical ope point of view , it is best to analyse experimental data for processes described by off - diagonal distributions in terms of the conformal moments @xmath39 of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) which diagonalize the ( lo ) evolution .",
    "however , phenomenologically it is more convenient to work in terms of the off - diagonal parton distributions themselves .",
    "the shuvaev transform ( [ eq : a9 ] ) and ( [ eq : a10 ] ) performs the necessary inverse of ( [ eq : a2 ] ) at any fixed @xmath48 and @xmath13 ; that is it enables @xmath46 to be constructed from @xmath47 .",
    "so far this is just a mathematical procedure .",
    "the crucial physical step is to relate the auxiliary function @xmath50 directly to the diagonal partons .",
    "it is easy to show , for @xmath51 , that @xmath50 in fact reduces to a diagonal parton distribution .",
    "indeed the conformal moments may be expressed in the form [ eq : a13 ] o_n ( ) = ^[(n + 1)/2]_k = 0 o_nk ^2k , which embodies the polynomial condition  that the power of @xmath1 should be at most of the order of @xmath52 .",
    "for @xmath51 we have [ eq : a14 ] o_n ( ) o_n0 = o_n ( 0 ) .",
    "now , up to the trivial normalization factor @xmath53 , the diagonal moment @xmath54 is equal to the @xmath40 moment of the diagonal parton distribution .",
    "so for @xmath55 we can put @xmath56 in ( [ eq : a10 ] ) , and then use ( [ eq : a11 ] ) to determine the off - diagonal distribution @xmath57 in terms of the conventional quark distribution . in this limit",
    "the kernel @xmath58 just becomes a non - trivial representation of the delta function @xmath59 .",
    "since ( [ eq : a11 ] ) is a principal value integration , the apparent singularity at @xmath60 is not a problem .",
    "however , for computation purposes , it is convenient to first weaken this singularity in the @xmath61 integration by integrating by parts . then ( [ eq : a10 ] ) and ( [ eq : a11 ] ) become [ eq : a15 ] h_q ( x , ) = _ -1 ^ 1 dx^ ( ) . here we have used the properties that @xmath62 as @xmath63 and that [ eq : a16 ] q^s ( x^ ) = -q^s ( - x^ ) , q^ns ( x^ ) = q^ns ( - x^ ) , see ( [ eq : a7 ] ) .",
    "note that , for small @xmath1 , we can identify the auxiliary function @xmath64 of ( [ eq : a9 ] ) with the diagonal partons at any scale , as the same anomalous dimensions @xmath45 control both the diagonal and off - diagonal evolution .",
    "so far we have neglected the @xmath15 dependence and set @xmath65 .",
    "however from the sum rule @xcite we know that the @xmath15 dependence of the first conformal moment is given by the proton form factor @xmath66 , [ eq : a17 ] o_n = 0 ( t ) = p^| _ 0 | p g ( t ) .",
    "in fact it is natural to assume that all the moments are proportional to @xmath66 [ eq : a18 ] o_n ( t ) = o_n ( t = 0 ) g ( t ) and simply multiply ( [ eq : a10 ] ) by @xmath66 to restore the @xmath15 dependence of the distributions .",
    "another argument in favour of such a factorization is the form of the mellin integration ( [ eq : a9 ] ) where , for small @xmath0 , the saddle point is located near the singularity at @xmath67 which comes from the behaviour of the singlet anomalous dimension , @xmath68 .",
    "thus the dominant contribution comes from @xmath69 which is indeed proportional to @xmath66 , and due to the polynomial condition ( [ eq : a13 ] ) does not depend on @xmath1 at all @xcite .",
    "the formula for the gluon is a little different to that for the quarks .",
    "the reason is that in the off - diagonal case the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 form the singlet multiplet which is multiplicatively renormalized .",
    "the additional @xmath0 in the gluon reveals itself as an extra factor of @xmath72 in the kernel .",
    "thus for the gluon , in place of ( [ eq : a15 ] ) , we have [ eq : a19 ] h_g ( x , ; t ) = x h_g^ji = _",
    "-1 ^ 1 dx^ ( ) g ( t ) .",
    "we see that ( [ eq : a15 ] ) and ( [ eq : a19 ] ) completely determine the behaviour of the off - diagonal distributions in the small @xmath73 domain in terms of the diagonal distributions .",
    "in fact by making the physically reasonable small @xmath0 assumption that the diagonal partons are given by [ eq : a20 ] x q ( x ) = n_q x^- _ q , xg ( x ) = n_g x^- _ g we can perform the @xmath74 integration analytically and note that @xmath75 ] .",
    "we obtain [ eq : a21 ] h_i ( x , ; t ) = n_i _ 0 ^ 1 ds ^p ^_i + 1 g ( t ) with @xmath41 or @xmath42 , and where @xmath76 and 1 for quarks and the gluon respectively .    at first sight",
    "it appears that for singlet quarks ( where @xmath77 and @xmath76 ) we face a strong singularity in integral ( [ eq : a21 ] ) when the term @xmath78 in the denominator .",
    "fortunately the singlet quark distribution is antisymmetric in @xmath0 . to obtain the imaginary part of the integral ( [ eq : a15 ] ) we must choose @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "therefore we must treat ( [ eq : a21 ] ) as a principal value integral and take the difference between the @xmath83 and @xmath84 limits .",
    "thus the main singularity is cancelled and ( [ eq : a21 ] ) becomes integrable for any @xmath85 .    note",
    "that the dominant contribution to the @xmath74 integrations of ( [ eq : a15 ] ) and ( [ eq : a19 ] ) comes from the region of small @xmath86 . indeed with the input given by ( [ eq : a20 ] ) , the integral for the quark distribution has a strong singularity at small @xmath74 [ eq : b21 ] i_q ~ dx^(x^)^- _ q - 3 ( ) .",
    "however when we take the imaginary part , the @xmath74 integration is cut - off by the theta function @xmath87 at [ eq : c21 ] x^ = 1/y",
    "( s ) ~ x + ( 1 - 2s ) .",
    "so we obtain the small @xmath1 behaviour @xmath88 , and the distribution ( [ eq : a15 ] ) has the form [ eq : d21 ] h_q ( x , ) = ^- _ q - 1 f_q ( x/ ) .",
    "similarly it follows that @xmath89 .    the predictions for the off - diagonal distributions",
    "are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "in diagrams ( a)(c ) we show the ratio @xmath90 to the diagonal distribution in the form [ eq : a22 ] r = , and so the only free parameter is @xmath91 , the exponent which fixes the @xmath92 behaviour of the input diagonal partons , as in ( [ eq : a20 ] ) .",
    "notice that on account of ( [ eq : d21 ] ) the ratios @xmath90 at small @xmath0 and @xmath1 are a function of only the ratio of the variables @xmath93 .",
    "the ratios @xmath90 of ( [ eq : a22 ] ) are the relevant ratios . for example , high energy diffractive @xmath94 electroproduction is described by two gluon exchange with [ eq : a23 ] x_1 ( q^2 + m_q|q^2 ) w^2 x_2 , where @xmath95 is the centre - of - mass energy of the proton and the photon of virtuality @xmath96 .",
    "a common approximation is to describe the process in terms of the diagonal gluon @xmath97 , sampled at @xmath98 . in this case",
    "the inclusion of off - diagonal effects will enhance the cross section by a factor of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is evaluated at @xmath101 , see fig .",
    "2(b ) or 2(d ) .    for @xmath102",
    "we see that the off - diagonal to diagonal ratios , @xmath90 , tend to unity , as expected .",
    "moreover , due to the @xmath103 antisymmetry property ( [ eq : a7 ] ) , we see that the quark singlet vanishes as @xmath104 .",
    "also for a flat input gluon , @xmath105 constant as @xmath104 ( that is @xmath106 ) , we see that @xmath100 does not depend on @xmath1 at all .",
    "the same is true for the quarks , but now when @xmath107 constant , that is when @xmath108 , as seen in the @xmath109 result of fig .",
    "all the scale dependence of the distributions is hidden in the @xmath96 behaviour of the powers @xmath110 .",
    "the position of the saddle point @xmath111 in the mellin integral ( [ eq : a9 ] ) moves to the right in the complex @xmath112 plane as @xmath96 and so the off - diagonal enhancement  increases ; in other words @xmath90 increases with @xmath96 .",
    "a particular example is the double logarithm approximation when , in the singlet sector , the saddle point [ eq : a24 ] n = _ g ( q^2 ) .    in fig .",
    "2(d ) we show the off - diagonal gluon distribution again , but now using a ( more detailed ) linear scale and comparing with the diagonal distribution @xmath113 taken at fixed @xmath114 , so as to avoid the extra @xmath0 dependence coming from the diagonal gluon in the denominator of the @xmath100 ratio .",
    "this demonstrates that the extra @xmath0 dependence is responsible for the slight decrease observed in @xmath100 of fig .",
    "2(b ) as @xmath104 , and that the decrease is not due to the behaviour of @xmath115 .",
    "the behaviour of the ratios at @xmath116 are explicitly @xmath117 where @xmath76 for quarks and @xmath118 for gluons .",
    "the ratios are plotted in fig .",
    "3 as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "the vertical arrows shown on the plot indicate the values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 obtained from the gluon and sea quark distributions at @xmath121 and 100  gev@xmath122 of a recent global ( diagonal ) parton analysis @xcite . the plot can be used to find the enhancement of the cross section for the high energy diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons arising from off - diagonal parton effects .",
    "the enhancement is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the value of the gluon ratio at @xmath123 , which is shown in fig .",
    "3 , at the appropriate scale , that is at the appropriate value of @xmath124 .",
    "for instance , for the photoproduction of @xmath125 and @xmath126 at hera the enhancement is about ( 1.15)@xmath122 and ( 1.32)@xmath122 respectively ) .",
    "for instance if we were to input @xmath127 in ( [ eq : a19 ] ) and to perform the @xmath74 integration numerically then we find @xmath100 increases from 1.32 to 1.41 for @xmath126 photoproduction at hera where @xmath128 ; the change in @xmath100 occurs because the @xmath0 sampled by the hera data is not sufficiently small .",
    "@xmath129 is in agreement with the previous estimates of the enhancement due to off - diagonal effects @xcite . ] , if we use a scale @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the mass of the vector meson .    from figs .  2 and 3 we see that the off - diagonal or skewed  effect ( the ratio @xmath90 ) is much stronger for singlet quarks than for gluons",
    "the explanation is straightforward . at",
    "low @xmath0 the distributions are driven by the double leading logarithmic evolution of the gluon distribution . at each step of the evolution",
    "the momentum fractions @xmath132 are strongly ordered ( @xmath133 on fig .  1 ) .",
    "for gluons it is just the last splitting function  @xmath134 which generates the main @xmath1 dependence , or skewedness , of the distribution .",
    "however for the sea or singlet quarks it is necessary to produce a quark with the help of @xmath135 at the last splitting .",
    "the splitting function @xmath135 has no logarithmic @xmath136 singularity and so @xmath137 is the order of @xmath138 . consequently both the splitting functions @xmath139 and @xmath140 generate the asymmetry of the off - diagonal distribution .",
    "hence , at low @xmath0 , the singlet quark has a much stronger off - diagonal effect than the gluon .",
    "in order to conclude that the conformal moments allow us to use the diagonal partons to uniquely determine the off - diagonal partons at small @xmath0 and @xmath1 , including also their normalisation and @xmath96 behaviour , it is necessary to consider some further points .",
    "first we could worry that in the analytical continuation in @xmath112 of the conformal moments , [ eq : a25 ] o_n = _",
    "k ^2k o_nk 2k < n + 1 , the higher ( @xmath141 ) terms will generate a singularity at @xmath142 .",
    "in such a case the small @xmath73 contribution would be driven by this singularity .",
    "however we show that such a singularity to the right of @xmath143 can not occur . from the structure of the polynomials @xmath38 of ( [ eq : a3 ] ) and ( [ eq : a5 ] )",
    ", it is clear that there are no such singularities for integer @xmath144 . on the other hand a singularity at non - integer @xmath145",
    "would generate a function @xmath50 of ( [ eq : a9 ] ) which depends on the ratio @xmath146 .",
    "after the convolution ( [ eq : a10 ] ) we would obtain a distribution which violates the polynomial condition @xcite , [ eq : a26 ] dx x^n h ( x , ) = _ k = 0^[(n + 1)/2 ] a_k ^2k , which comes from lorentz invariance ( and the tensor structure of the operators ) . thus the higher @xmath147 terms ( with @xmath141 ) in ( [ eq : a13 ] ) should die out with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "a second consideration is that , from a formal point of view , we may add to the off - diagonal distribution any function [ eq : a27 ] h ( x , ) = g ( x , ) ( - | x | ) which exists only in the time - like erbl region  @xcite with @xmath148 .",
    "such a contribution @xmath149 remains in the erbl region during evolution .",
    "however @xmath149 disappears as @xmath17 and so it can not be restored purely from diagonal partons .",
    "a physical way to model such an erbl contribution is to consider @xmath15 channel meson ( @xmath150 ) exchanges of fig .",
    "the contribution @xmath149 is then given by the leading twist wave function @xmath151 of the meson multiplied by the corresponding regge exchange amplitude [ eq : a28 ] h^reggeon = _ m ( x/ , q^2 ) ^- _ m ( t ) v ( ^2 = q_0 ^ 2 ; ; t ) .",
    "the appropriate exchange is the @xmath152 meson which , in the constituent quark model , is formed from a @xmath153-wave @xmath94 state with @xmath154 .",
    "the regge factor @xmath155 is the analogue of the @xmath156 ( or @xmath157 ) factor in the non - singlet quark distribution @xmath158 ; in our notation of ( [ eq : a20 ] ) and fig .",
    "2 with @xmath159 we have @xmath160 .",
    "phenomenologically we expect that @xmath161 .",
    "the key factor in ( [ eq : a28 ] ) is @xmath162 which specifies the coupling of the reggeon to the proton . from regge",
    "phenomenology the vertex factor @xmath162 was extracted for the diagonal case where the erbl domain does not exist .",
    "let us try to estimate a possible erbl contribution to the off - diagonal distributions .",
    "the value of the pion - nucleon @xmath163-term at low scales determines the number of current quarks and antiquarks in the nucleon to be @xcite [ eq : a29 ] n | |qq | n 8 . allowing for valence quarks , this implies that the average number of @xmath94 pairs is about 2.5 . at such low scales",
    "the partons are distributed more or less uniformly in the whole @xmath164 interval and so the probability to find two partons in the erbl domain @xmath165 is of the order of @xmath147 .",
    "such a @xmath149 is a negligible @xmath166 contribution at small @xmath1 in agreement with our decomposition of the conformal moments .",
    "so far our distributions enable us to calculate the imaginary part of the amplitude , say for compton scattering , @xmath167 and @xmath168 . ] with incoming and outgoing photon virtualities @xmath169 and @xmath170 . at small @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "it turns out that the real part of the amplitude may be calculated easily using a dispersion relation in the centre - of - mass energy squared @xmath171 .",
    "let us consider the cut in the right - half @xmath172 plane , that is the discontinuity for @xmath173 . for fixed @xmath174 and @xmath175 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath176 is fixed as well , since @xmath177 .",
    "thus the energy squared may be written [ eq : a30 ] w_s^2 = ( 1 - x ) = ( 1 - r ) .",
    "however we must take into account the cuts in both right and left half - planes , that is the @xmath61 and @xmath178 channel cuts .",
    "the left - hand cut corresponds to the @xmath178 channel process ( obtained by the interchange @xmath179 ) with energy squared [ eq : a31 ] w_u^2 = - ( 1 + x ) . the unpolarized deeply virtual compton amplitude is the sum of the @xmath61- and @xmath178- channel terms , @xmath180 , and appears to have even signature , that is @xmath181 is crossing symmetric .",
    "strictly speaking at large @xmath0 and @xmath1 there is some asymmetry ( since @xmath182 ) , which may be considered as the odd signature contribution and should be treated appropriately in the dispersion integral .",
    "however the situation is particularly simple at small @xmath183 , where @xmath184 .",
    "then we may write the whole amplitude @xmath185 , with the help of the even signature factor [ eq : a32 ] s^+ = ( 1 + ( -1)^ ) , in the form [ eq : a33 ] a = a ( 1 + e^- i ) .",
    "moreover for small @xmath91 we have [ eq : a34 ] re a a.    strictly speaking the conformal moments @xmath39 only renormalize multiplicatively , as in ( [ eq : a8 ] ) , at leading order ( lo ) . due to a conformal anomaly at next - to - leading ( nlo ) the moment @xmath39 mixes , on evolution , with moments @xmath186 with @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "the mixing is taken into account by a matrix @xmath188 , which obeys its own evolution equation @xcite .",
    "of course the mixing is absent in the diagonal case when @xmath189 , whereas for non - zero @xmath1 we have [ eq : a35 ] o_n^nlo = _",
    "nn^ o_n^^nlo ( diag ) ^n - n^ where @xmath190 and @xmath188 all depend on @xmath191 .",
    "thus in the small @xmath51 limit we can safely use expressions ( [ eq : a15 ] ) and ( [ eq : a19 ] ) for @xmath46 even at nlo .    in summary , in the low @xmath1 region we can use expressions ( [ eq : a15 ] ) and ( [ eq : a19 ] ) to reliably predict the off - diagonal distributions @xmath46 in terms of the diagonal partons at any scale .",
    "all that is required is a two - fold integration .",
    "the expected accuracy is of the order of @xmath147 . as a specific example we assumed in ( [ eq : a20 ] ) that the diagonal partons had a power - like @xmath192 behaviour for small @xmath0 . in this case",
    "one integration can be done analytically and we have even simpler expressions for @xmath70 and @xmath193 , see ( [ eq : a21 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figs .  2 and 3 and",
    "allow the off - diagonal distributions to be determined for any small @xmath73 values at any scale .",
    "one important consequence is that data for processes , which are described by off - diagonal distributions , can be included in a global analysis to better constrain the low @xmath0 behaviour of the ( conventional ) diagonal partons .",
