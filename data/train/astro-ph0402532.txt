    "recent observations suggest that large black holes may reside in the centers of some stellar clusters .",
    "x - ray observations in the last few years have shown unresolved sources in galaxies offset from their nuclei and with fluxes that , if isotropic , correspond to luminosities of @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many of these sources are associated with stellar clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the strong variability observed in these sources suggests that they are black holes , and if the observed fluxes are neither strongly beamed nor super - eddington , the implied masses are as high as @xmath7 .",
    "the fact the sources are non - nuclear implies masses @xmath8 since a larger mass would have rapidly sunk to the center of the host galaxy due to dynamical friction ( @xmath9  yr for a dispersion velocity of @xmath10 and a separation from the galaxy nucleus of @xmath11 as in the case of m82 ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , optical observations of the globular clusters m15 and g1 show velocity profiles consistent with central black holes with masses of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively @xcite , although @xcite demonstrate with their n - body simulations that the observations of g1 can be explained without a large black hole . such intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) would be in a different mass category , and thus likely indicative of a different formation scenario , from either @xmath14 - @xmath15 stellar - mass black holes , which are thought to be the result of core - collapse supernovae , or @xmath16 - @xmath17 supermassive black holes , which are found in the centers of many galaxies .",
    "several models have been proposed to account for the origin of imbhs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that they are the remnants of massive ( @xmath18 ) population  iii stars .",
    "the low metallicity of these stars precludes cooling through metal line emission and enables them to reach masses much larger than ordinary main sequence stars .",
    "these large stars avoid significant mass loss due to stellar winds or pulsations , and the star may collapse to form a black hole with almost the same mass as the progenitor star . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show with numerical simulations that the core of a young stellar cluster may collapse rapidly such that direct collisions of stars will lead to runaway growth of a single object with as much as @xmath19 of the original cluster mass over the course of a few million years .",
    "@xcite propose that over a hubble time stellar - mass black holes in dense globular clusters may grow by mergers to the inferred imbh masses . in their model ,",
    "a black hole with mass greater than @xmath20 will interact with other massive objects to form binaries that will merge due to gravitational radiation .",
    "the merger process may proceed more quickly in the presence of encounters with a third black hole or another black hole binary @xcite if the encounters shrink the binary s orbit , as is known to happen with hard ( tight ) binaries @xcite .",
    "wherever and however imbhs formed , the best candidates are found in stellar clusters where three - body encounters are important .",
    "an imbh in a cluster , whether formed there or later swallowed by the cluster , will find its way to the center .",
    "as all of the heaviest objects in a cluster sink to the center in a process known as mass segregation , the imbh will interact primarily with other massive objects and binaries @xcite .",
    "a single imbh will tend to acquire companions through exchanges with binaries because the most massive pair of objects in a three - body encounter preferentially end up in the binary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the imbh binary will encounter other objects in the dense center of its host cluster , harden further , and ultimately merge .",
    "these events are important sources of gravitational waves .",
    "the advanced ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ) detector is expected to be capable of detecting mergers of imbhs with @xmath21 @xcite , and lisa ( laser interferometer space antenna ) is expected to detect the earlier inspiral phase of an imbh merger @xcite . in order to predict the gravitational wave signature of the inspiral",
    ", the expected separations and eccentricities of the binaries must be known .",
    "because three - body encounters alter the orbital parameters , simulations are needed to predict their distributions as well as the source population and event rates .",
    "the three - body problem has been studied extensively , but with every new generation of computing power , our understanding of the problem advances with a wider range of numerical simulations and a changing perspective on this rich but conceptually simple problem .",
    "previous studies of the three - body problem have tended to focus on the case of equal or nearly equal masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) though other mass ratios have been studied ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nearly equal mass case does not apply to the case of an imbh in the core of a stellar cluster .",
    "in addition the vast majority of previous work has studied the effect of a single encounter on a binary . to determine the ultimate fate of an imbh , simulations of sequences of encounters are needed .",
    "furthermore , to our knowledge no previous work has considered the effects of orbital decay due to gravitational radiation between encounters , which we expect to be important for very tight binaries .    in this paper",
    "we present numerical simulations of sequences of high - mass ratio binary - single encounters .",
    "we describe the code used to simulate the encounters in   [ nummeth ] .",
    "next , we present results of the simulations of sequences of encounters on a range of mass ratios with newtonian gravity (   [ newt ] ) and with gravitational radiation between encounters (   [ grseq ] ) and show that including gravitational radiation decreases the duration of the sequence by @xmath22 to @xmath4 . in   [ imbhformation ] and",
    "  [ gwdetection ] we discuss the implications of these results for imbh formation and gravitational wave detection .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of the interactions of a massive binary in a stellar cluster . simulating the full cluster is beyond current n - body techniques , so we focus instead on a sequence of three - body encounters .",
    "massive cluster objects , such as imbhs and tight binary systems , tend to sink the centers of clusters so that a single imbh is very likely to meet a binary @xcite .",
    "exchanges in which the imbh acquires a close companion are common .",
    "such a binary in a stellar cluster core will experience repeated interactions with additional objects as long as the recoils from these interactions do not eject the binary .",
    "therefore , we simulate a _ sequence _ of encounters between a hard binary and an interloper .",
    "we perform one interaction and then use the resulting binary for the next encounter .",
    "this is repeated multiple times until the binary finally merges due to gravitational radiation . because typical velocities involved are non - relativistic and the black holes are tiny compared to their separations , they are treated as newtonian point masses . in order to test the influence of the binary s mass",
    ", we use a range of binary mass ratios . to simplify the problem we study a binary with mass ratio of @xmath23:10  @xmath24 and a 10@xmath0 interloper , designated as @xmath23:@xmath25:@xmath25 , and vary @xmath23 between 10@xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "the simulations were done using a binary - single scattering code that was written to be as general purpose as possible .",
    "because of the vast parameter space that needs to be covered , the code uses a monte carlo initial condition generator .",
    "the orbits are integrated using hnbody , a hierarchical , direct n - body integrator , with the adaptive fourth order runge kutta integrator option ( k.  rauch & d.  hamilton , in preparation ) . because we focus on close approaches where a wide range of timescales are important , an adaptive scheme is often better than symplectic methods .",
    "in wide hierarchical triples , direct integration can consume a large amount of computational time . to reduce this",
    ", we employ a two - body approximation scheme that tracks the phase of the inner binary . for a sufficiently large outer orbit ,",
    "the orbit is approximately that of an object about the center of mass of the binary .",
    "we calculate this approximate two - body orbit analytically and keep track of the inner binary s phase .",
    "when the outer object nears the binary again , we revert to direct numerical integration .",
    "the orbit is integrated until one of three conditions is met : 1 ) one mass departs along a hyperbolic path , 2 ) the system forms a hierarchical triple with outer semimajor axis greater than @xmath27 , an orbit so large that it would likely be perturbed in the high density of a cluster core and not return , or 3 ) the integration is prohibitively long , in which case the encounter is discarded and restarted with new randomly generated initial conditions .",
    "roughly @xmath28 of all encounters had to be restarted with most occurring for higher mass ratios where resonant encounters ( encounters that have more than one close approach and are not simple fly - bys ) are more common . in half of our simulations , we evolve the binary s orbit due to gravitational wave emission after each encounter .",
    "since a binary in a cluster spends most of its time and emits most of its gravitational radiation while waiting for an encounter rather than during an interaction , we only include gravitational radiation between encounters . to isolate this effect , we run simulations both with and without gravitational radiation .",
    "we include gravitational radiation by utilizing orbit - averaged expressions for the change in semimajor axis @xmath29 and eccentricity @xmath30 with respect to time @xcite : @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are the gravitational masses of the binary pair .",
    "here @xmath36 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath37 is the speed of light .",
    "the orbital elements are evolved until the next encounter takes place , at a time that we choose randomly from an exponential distribution with a mean encounter time , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number density of objects in the cluster s core , @xmath40 is the relative velocity , and @xmath41 is the cross - section of the binary . if we assume the mass of the binary @xmath42 , then @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the maximum considered close approach of @xmath45 to the binary s center of mass . for a thermal distribution of stellar speeds , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the average mass of the main sequence star and @xmath48 is the main sequence velocity dispersion . in our simulations , the second term of eq .",
    "[ crosssection ] , gravitational focusing , dominates over the first . averaging over velocity ( assumed to be maxwellian ) we find    @xmath49",
    "we then subject the binary to another encounter using orbital parameters adjusted by both the previous encounter and the gravitational radiation emitted between the encounters .",
    "this sequence of encounters continues until the binary merges due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "if orbital decay is not being calculated , then we determine that the binary has merged when the randomly drawn encounter time is longer than the timescale to merger , which is approximately @xmath50 for the high eccentricities of importance in this paper .",
    "global energy and angular momentum are monitored to ensure accurate integration .",
    "the code also keeps track of the duration of encounters , the time between encounters , changes in semimajor axis and eccentricity , and exchanges ( events in which the interloping mass replaces one of the original members of the binary and the replaced member escapes ) .    as a test of our code , we compared simulations of several individual three - body encounters to compare with the work of @xcite .",
    "as part of a series of works examining binary - single star scattering events , @xcite performed numerical simulations of very hard binaries with a wide range of mass ratios and calculated their cross - sections for exchange .",
    "we ran simulations of one encounter each of a sample of mass ratios for comparison . to facilitate comparison of encounters with differing masses , semimajor axes , and relative velocities of hard binaries , @xcite use a dimensionless cross - section , @xmath51 where @xmath40 is",
    "the relative velocity of the interloper and the binary s center of mass at infinity and @xmath52 is the physical cross - section for exchanges .",

    "figure  [ timescale ] shows the time to reach a specified mass for both the newtonian and gravitational radiation cases .    although there is clearly enough time to build imbhs as @xcite propose , the issues of whether there are enough stellar - mass black holes and whether the cluster will hold onto the imbh remain .",
    "the combination of an initial mass of @xmath20 and an escape velocity of @xmath114 is not likely to produce an imbh in a globular cluster through three - body interactions with @xmath92 black holes , but the general process could still produce imbhs .",
    "@xcite argued that a seed mass of 50@xmath0 would be retained , but for analytical simplicity they assumed that every encounter changed the semimajor axis by the same fractional amount @xmath115 .",
    "some encounters , however , can decrease the semimajor axis by several times the average value and thus impart much larger kicks .",
    "the authors therefore underestimated the minimum initial mass necessary to remain in the cluster .",
    "a hierarchical merging of stellar - mass black holes could , however , still produce an imbh if 1 ) the initial mass of the black hole were were greater than @xmath20 , 2 ) the escape velocity of the cluster were greater than @xmath114 , or 3 ) additional dynamics were involved .",
    "we consider each of these in turn .",
    "if the mass of the initial black hole were , e.g. , @xmath116 before the onset of compact object dynamics , dynamical kicks would not be likely to eject the imbh , and it would require fewer mergers to reach @xmath95 and thus a smaller population of stellar mass black holes .",
    "the initial black hole could start with such a mass if it evolved from a massive population  iii star or from a runaway collision of main sequence stars @xcite , or it could reach such a mass by accretion of young massive stars , which would be torn apart by tidal forces and impart little dynamical kick .",
    "if the initial globular cluster mass is high enough ( work by @xcite indicate masses of @xmath117 are available ) , then the cluster s gravity may be strong enough to retain the gas normally expelled by the first generation of supernovae .",
    "if that increases the escape velocity to , e.g. , @xmath118 , the interactions result in a smaller fraction of ejected binaries .",
    "the probability of building from @xmath20 to @xmath95 then increases by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "in addition , processes with lower dynamical kicks could prevent ejection .",
    "one promising mechanism is the kozai resonance @xcite .",
    "if a stable hierarchical triple is formed , then resonant processes can pump up the inner binary s eccentricity high enough so that it would quickly merge due to gravitational radiation and without any dynamical kick to eject the imbh from the cluster .",
    "two - body captures ( captures in which an interloper passes close enough to the isolated imbh that it becomes bound and merges due to gravitational radiation ) would also result in mergers without dynamical kicks .",
    "both kozai - resonance - induced mergers and two - body captures are devoid of dynamical kicks , but they would suffer a gravitational radiation recoil . a system in which a @xmath92 black hole merges into a @xmath119 non - rotating black hole would have a recoil velocity @xmath120 @xcite . since @xmath121 , a merger between a @xmath92 black hole and a seed black hole of mass of @xmath116 , as discussed above , would experience a recoil velocity @xmath122 .",
    "mergers with lower mass objects that are torn apart by tidal forces , such as white dwarfs , would receive no gravitational radiation recoil .",
    "finally , a range of interloper masses instead of the simplified single mass population that we used here may also affect retention statistics since a smaller interloper would impart smaller kicks while still contributing to hardening .",
    "increasing the seed mass and the escape velocity will reduce the number of field black holes ejected but not by enough .",
    "as seen in figure  [ ejvm ] , using a seed mass @xmath123 and an escape velocity @xmath124 reduces the number of black holes ejected by 40% , but this is still several factors more than are available .",
    "the kozai - resonance - induced mergers and two - body captures , however , are methods of merging without possibility of ejecting stellar - mass black holes . in order to reach our canonical @xmath95 intermediate mass while ejecting fewer than @xmath97 black holes ,",
    "70 - 80% of the mergers must come from these ejectionless methods .",
    "our simulations make predictions interesting for gravitational wave detection . after the last encounter of a sequence",
    ", the binary will merge due to gravitational radiation . as the binary shrinks and circularizes , the frequency of the gravitational radiation emitted passes through the lisa band ( @xmath28 to @xmath125 ) @xcite and then through the bands of ground - based detectors such as ligo , virgo , geo-600 , and tama ( @xmath126 to @xmath127 ) @xcite . by the time the binaries are detectable by ground - based instruments ,",
    "they will have completely circularized , but while in the lisa band , some will have measurable eccentricities .",
    "we calculate the distribution of eccentricities detectable by lisa by integrating equations  [ petersa ]  and  [ peterse ] until the orbital frequency reaches @xmath128 at which point the gravitational wave frequency is in lisa s most sensitive range and is above the expected white dwarf background .",
    "figure  [ lisafreq ] shows the distribution of eccentricities for binaries with gravitational radiation in the lisa band .",
    "there are more low eccentricities at higher mass ratios .",
    "this is because at low mass ratios each encounter takes a fractionally larger amount of energy away from the binary than at high mass ratios .",
    "thus at low mass ratios , the last encounter will tend to harden the binary such that it is closer to merger . at high mass ratios , however , encounters take a smaller fractional amount of energy from the binary , and , thus , the high mass ratio binaries have more time to circularize more during their orbital decay . for the 1000:10:10 mass ratio ,",
    "a large fraction of the eccentricities are in the range @xmath129 where the binary is eccentric enough to display general relativistic effects such as pericenter precession , but circular templates may be sufficient for initial detection of the gravitational wave . finally , because the first few hundred million years of a cluster s life witness a large number of mergers , recently formed and nearby super star clusters are promising sources of gravitational waves from imbh coalescence .",
    "we present results of numerical simulations of sequences of binary - single black hole scattering events in a dense stellar environment .",
    "we simulate three - body encounters until the binary will merge due to gravitational radiation before the next encounter . in half of our simulations",
    ", we include the effect of gravitational radiation between encounters .",
    "_ 1 . sequences of high mass ratio encounters .",
    "_ our simulations cover a range of mass ratios including those corresponding to imbhs in stellar clusters .",
    "because the binaries simulated are tightly bound , the encounters steadily shrink the binary s semimajor axis until it merges .",
    "the eccentricity , however , jumps chaotically between high and low values over the course of a sequence .",
    "merger usually occurs at high eccentricity since gravitational radiation is much stronger then .",
    "_ 2 . gravitational wave emission between encounters . _",
    "the inclusion of gravitational radiation between encounters affects the simulations in several ways .",
    "the extra source of shrinking caused by gravitational wave emission has the effect of shortening the sequence in terms of both the number of encounters and the total time , and the circularization from gravitational waves has the effect of decreasing the final eccentricity of the binary before it merges .",
    "imbh formation .",
    "_ our simulations directly test the imbh formation model of @xcite .",
    "we find that there is sufficient time to build up to @xmath95 when starting from @xmath20 , but our simulations also show that if there are a thousand @xmath92 black holes in the globular cluster , the seed black hole would only be able to grow to @xmath99 before exhausting half of the black holes in the cluster .",
    "in addition , the probability of the binary s remaining in the cluster during a growth from @xmath130 to @xmath99 is small . in order to avoid ejection from the cluster with a reasonable probability , either the black hole must have a larger mass at the onset of dynamical encounters",
    ", the cluster s escape velocity must be larger , or the black hole must grow by some additional mechanisms such as by kozai - resonance - induced mergers , two - body captures , or from smaller interlopers .",
    "_ 4 . gravitational wave detection . _",
    "the mergers of binary black hole systems are strong sources of detectable gravitational waves .",
    "we find that the merging binary will typically start with very high eccentricity . by the time the binary is detectable by the advanced ligo detector ,",
    "it will have completely circularized , but when detectable by lisa , it may have moderate eccentricity ( @xmath131 ) such that it will display general relativistic effects such as pericenter precession and still possibly be detectable with circular templates .",
    "we find a high rate of mergers in the first few hundred million years of a globular cluster .",
    "this suggests that recently formed , nearby super star clusters are promising sources for gravitational radiation from imbh coalescence .    further work in this study will be to include a distribution of interloper masses instead of a single population of @xmath92 black holes .",
    "a mass distribution of black holes is a more realistic model of a cluster core and could change the outcomes of the sequences .",
    "exchanges will be more important since encounters with the more prevalent smaller black holes may do most of the hardening until a more massive black hole exchanges into the binary .",
    "we thank j.  m. fregeau , f.  a. rasio , and s.  sigurdsson for helpful discussions and comments .",
