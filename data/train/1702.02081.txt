    "very recently , gravitational waves were detected at the advanced ligo interferometer @xcite , opening a new window for the observation of the universe .",
    "when the design sensitivity is reached by the second generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors ( advanced ligo , advanced virgo and kagra ) , which is expected to happen around the year 2021 , such instruments will be ten times more sensitive than the first generation .",
    "such sensitivity will probably allow the detection of pulsation modes of compact stars excited in binary mergers , in newly born compact objects associated with the violent dynamics of core collapse supernovae , or due to the structure rearrangements induced by phase transitions at neutron star cores .",
    "the vast family of oscillation modes of compact stars can be classified into polar modes producing spheroidal fluid deformations , and axial modes producing toroidal deformations .",
    "modes are said to be fluid if they involve a significant fluid motion , and spacetime if they only involve vibrations of spacetime . in the case of polar fluid modes ,",
    "the most well know in the literature are the fundamental ( @xmath0 ) , the pressure ( @xmath3 ) , and the gravity ( @xmath4 ) modes , but there are other relevant modes such as the shear mode in a solid crust or the alfvn modes in the presence of magnetic fields . in the case of axial modes , there are torsional modes and rotational modes ( rossby and inertial modes ) .",
    "there are also polar and axial spacetime modes , which only involve vibrations of spacetime ( @xmath5 modes ) .",
    "the analysis of pulsation modes can reveal details about the internal properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "in particular , there has been great interest in the identification of features in the modes that may characterize unequivocally the appearance of deconfined quark matter @xcite . in the present work we focus on the effect of color superconductivity on polar fluid modes , since pairing interactions are expected to have a key role in quark matter at sufficiently large densities and low temperatures . at",
    "asymptotically large densities , where the quark masses are negligibly small compared to the quark chemical potential , three - flavor quark matter is in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) state @xcite . in this state quarks form",
    "cooper pairs of different color and flavor where all quarks have the same fermi momentum and electrons can not be present @xcite .",
    "color - flavor locking has a significant effect on many features of quark matter , such as transport properties . in the equations of state ( eos ) , it introduces corrections of order @xmath6 which is around a few percent for typical values of the color superconducting gap ( @xmath7 mev ) and the baryon chemical potential ( @xmath8 mev ) .",
    "however , the effect is proportionally very large in the low pressure regime that affects the absolute stability of quark matter .",
    "thus , self - bound stars made up of quark matter from the center up to the stellar surface ( _ strange stars _ ) may exist for a wide range of parameters of the mit bag model eos @xcite .",
    "studies of the structure of these objects show that color superconductivity affects significantly the mass - radius relationship of strange stars , allowing for very large maximum masses @xcite .    in previous works we explored the impact of color superconductivity on radial oscillations of color flavor locked",
    "strange stars @xcite .",
    "we also used the cowling approximation to analyze the non - radial fluid modes of hadronic , hybrid and pure self - bound strange quark stars , including stars with color supercondicting phases @xcite . in the present work we concentrate on the fundamental oscillation mode because it is the most efficient emitter of gravitational waves in the case of non - rotating objects .",
    "specifically , we concentrate on the effect that color superconductivity could produce in the eventually detectable gravitational wave signal related to the @xmath0-mode for stellar configurations with a maximum mass above @xmath9 @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ results ] present our results spanning all possible parametrizations of the eos for cfl strange quark matter and give analytic fittings for the frequency as a function of the average stellar density and for the gravitational damping time as a function of the stellar compactness . finally , in sec .

    ".set of parameters employed in the present paper . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to study the radial oscillations of a compact star , we must determine first its equilibrium configuration .",
    "assuming that the unperturbed compact star is totally composed of a perfect fluid , the stress - energy momentum tensor can be expressed as @xmath10    the generic background space - time of a static spherical star is expressed through the line element @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the set of schwarzschild - like coordinates , and the metric potentials @xmath13 and @xmath14 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath15 only . the einstein equations in such a spacetime lead to the following set of stellar structure equations ( tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational mass inside the radius @xmath15 .",

    "however , values to the right in fig .",
    "[ window ] , e.g. models cfl16 , cfl17 , cfl18 and cfl19 result in small maximum masses ( see table [ stellar_structure ] ) .",
    "in fact , since the maximum mass decreases with @xmath22 ( see @xcite ) , models to the right of cfl19 in fig . [ window ] are incompatible with the existence of the massive pulsars psr j1614 - 2230 with @xmath23 @xcite and psr j0348 - 0432 with @xmath24 @xcite .          to obtain the equations that govern the non - radial oscillations , both fluid and spacetime variables are perturbed .",

    "a given choice of the eos s parameters , the oscillation frequency does nt vary strongly with the stellar mass ; typically , a star with 0.5 @xmath84 and a star with a mass close to the maximum one , have frequencies that differ by less than @xmath85 .",

    "[ damping ] we see that the damping time is in the range @xmath86 s for cfl strange stars with @xmath87 .",
    "we also see that if @xmath81 is increased for fixed @xmath22 and @xmath82 , there is a shift of the curves upwards and to the right ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",

    "@xmath0 varies by less than @xmath85 in the mass interval from 0.5 @xmath84 to the maximum mass .",
    "the frequency depends on the eos s parameters as follows ( see fig .",
    "[ frequency ] ) : as @xmath81 is increased keeping constant the other parameters the @xmath0 versus @xmath21 curves move downwards and to the right ; as @xmath22 ( or @xmath82 ) is increased keeping constant the other parameters the @xmath0 versus @xmath21 curves move upwards and to the left .",
    "the damping time is in the range @xmath86 s for cfl strange stars with @xmath87 .",
    "keeping constant all other parameters the @xmath79 versus @xmath21 curves behave as follows ( see fig . [ damping ] ) : if @xmath81 is increased the curves move upwards and to the right ; if @xmath22 ( or @xmath82 ) is increased the curves move downwards and to the left .",
    "our results show that cfl strange stars can radiate in the optimal range for present gravitational wave detectors and that it is possible to constrain the eos parameters if the fundamental oscillation mode is observed and the stellar mass is determined .",
    "we have also shown that the @xmath0-mode frequency can be fitted as a function of the square root of the average stellar density @xmath1 by a single linear relation that fits quite accurately the results for all parametrizations of the eos ( see eq . ) .",
    "all results for the damping time can also be fitted as a function of the compactness @xmath2 by a single empirical relation given in eq . .",
    "therefore , if a given compact object is identified as a cfl strange star ( e.g. from the photon emission properties of a bare surface ) these two relations could be used to determine the mass and the radius from the knowledge of the frequency and damping time of the @xmath0 mode . on the other hand , since the fittings for cfl strange stars are different to typical hadronic fittings ( see figs . [",
    "fig : linear_f ] and [ fig : linear_tau ] ) the observation of the @xmath0-mode could potentially help in the discrimination of cfl strange stars and hadronic stars .",
    "however , notice that the hadronic and cfl fittings tend to overlap for values above @xmath98 0.27 and above @xmath99 which is precisely the range of more massive stars , i.e. the more interesting from the observational point of view .",
    "this overlapping is in accordance with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the fluid modes of hadronic , hybrid and strange stars were investigated within the cowling approximation .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , for masses above @xmath100 it is difficult to discriminate hadronic , hybrid and strange stars based solely on the @xmath0-mode , because of the superposition of the curves . to discriminate them",
    "it is necessary to perform a combined comparison of the @xmath4 mode ( for hybrid stars ) and the first pressure mode @xmath101 .",
    "nonetheless , we emphasize that if a given star is identified as a cfl strange star by another method ( e.g. through its electromagnetic or neutrino emission ) the @xmath0-mode can be used to determine the stellar mass and radius .",
    "if excited , the fundamental mode is damped not only by gravitational radiation , but also by viscous mechanisms if the viscosity is large enough . in the case of unpaired quark matter",
    "the most effective damping reaction is the nonleptonic process @xmath102 . for a typical stellar oscillation frequency of @xmath103 khz ,",
    "oscillations are viscously damped in fractions of a second due to the nonleptonic process @xcite , and can interfere in the determination of the gravitational damping time . however , for the cfl phase the picture changes drastically because the above mentioned nonleptonic reactions are strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties are rather determined by the massless superfluid phonons @xmath104 and thermally excited light pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons . at low temperatures ,",
    "the contribution to bulk viscosity from phonons alone is several orders of magnitude smaller than for unpaired quark matter @xcite .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to the bulk viscosity may come from processes involving the neutral kaon @xmath105 @xcite . for temperatures above a few mev ,",
    "the bulk viscosity @xmath106 can become larger than for unpaired quark matter , but at low temperatures @xmath106 is much less than that of unpaired quark matter ( see also @xcite ) . as a consequence , for cold enough objects we may expect that the fundamental mode will be damped only by gravitational radiation , and the determination of the frequency and damping time of the fundamental mode could be a promising way to constrain the properties of cfl strange stars .",
