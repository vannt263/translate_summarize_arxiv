    "this paper is a step toward a geometric and functorial approach to poisson manifold quantization . at its core is a micro - version of the geometric approach to the quantization of poisson manifolds by symplectic groupoids , as developed in @xcite .",
    "this micro - version is essentially obtained by replacing groupoids by groupoid germs ( or `` microgroupoids '' ) and canonical relations by symplectic micromorphisms , which are the special canonical relation germs introduced in @xcite .",
    "after these replacements , geometric constructions that are only functorial - looking in the world of groupoids and canonical relations become honest functors in the world of microgroupoids and symplectic micromorphisms .",
    "we will use quotation marks to remind us when we are not dealing with honest categories and functors .    in this paper , we are mostly concerned with developing a functorial micro - version of two constructions .",
    "the first construction is a symplectization `` functor '' @xmath0 , as in fernandes @xcite .",
    "it replaces a poisson manifold with its source 1-connected symplectic groupoid and a poisson map with the lagrangian subgroupoid integrating its graph , which is regarded as a coisotropic submanifold .",
    "the second functorial - looking construction , called @xmath1 , replaces a symplectic groupoid with a monoid object in the symplectic `` category '' ( i.e. , the category of symplectic manifolds and canonical relations ) and a lagrangian subgroupoid in the product of two symplectic groupoids with a monoid map .    in the micro - world ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 become honest functors , both of which are equivalences of symmetric monoidal categories .",
    "moreover , they have additional advantages over their macro - world counterparts :    * the domain of @xmath0 is now the category of _ all _ poisson manifolds and poisson maps , as opposed to the macro - world where @xmath0 is only defined for the class of _ integrable _ poisson manifolds ; * a monoid object in the microsymplectic category characterizes the symplectic microgroupoid it comes from completely , as opposed to the macro - world where the inverse map is not part of the monoid structure alone ( see example [ exam : sing .",
    "gpd ] and @xcite for similar issues related to the inverse map ) .",
    "the composition @xmath2 ( which we call the `` zakrzewski functor '' ) establishes an equivalence of monoidal categories between the category of poisson manifolds and poisson maps and the category of monoids and monoid morphisms in the microsymplectic category .",
    "this is the main result of this paper . in itself",
    ", it gives a categorical formulation of poisson geometry ; it allows us to replace , in a functorial way , the poisson bivector field with a commutative diagram in a monoidal category .",
    "moreover , it gives an appropriate categorical framework for poisson manifold functorial quantization by symplectic ( micro)groupoid methods .",
    "this framework may also be relevant for functorial aspects of star - product dequantization as in @xcite .",

    "we fix here some notations and terminology .    a * poisson manifold * is a smooth manifold @xmath3 whose algebra of smooth functions is endowed with a poisson bracket ; i.e. a lie bracket @xmath4 on the space of smooth functions @xmath5 that is a derivation in each argument .",
    "thus , this bracket is completely determined by a bivector field @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 . a * poisson map * @xmath9 is a smooth map such that @xmath10 respects the poisson brackets .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the category of poisson manifolds and poisson maps .",
    "this category is monoidal ( see @xcite for a general reference on monoidal categories ) . namely , the tensor product of two poisson manifolds , denoted by @xmath12 , is defined by endowing the cartesian product @xmath13 of the manifold with the poisson bivector field @xmath14 given by the sum of the poisson bivector fields .",
    "on poisson maps , the tensor product is simply the usual cartesian product of maps .",
    "the unit object of the category is the one - point manifold endowed with its unique ( zero ) poisson structure .",
    "@xmath11 is in fact a symmetric monoidal category , whose symmetries @xmath15 are the usual factor permutations @xmath16 .    a * coisotropic submanifold * @xmath17 of a poisson manifold @xmath18 is a submanifold satisfying the condition @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the vector bundle map @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the conormal bundle of @xmath17 .",
    "coisotropic submanifolds play a role similar to that of lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic geometry : namely , a smooth map @xmath9 is poisson if and only if its graph , denoted by @xmath23 , is a coisotropic submanifold of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the * dual poisson manifold * of @xmath26 , which is the manifold @xmath27 endowed with the opposite poisson structure @xmath28 .    there is a notion of integration for poisson manifolds by symplectic groupoids that generalizes the integration of lie algebras by lie groups .",
    "a * symplectic groupoid * is a lie groupoid @xmath29 ( see @xcite for a general reference on lie groupoids ) whose total space @xmath30 is a symplectic manifold and such that the graph of the groupoid product @xmath31 is a lagrangian submanifold of @xmath32 .",
    "a symplectic groupoid endows its unit space @xmath3 with a unique poisson structure such that the target map @xmath33 ( resp .",
    "the source map @xmath34 ) is poisson ( resp .",
    "anti - poisson ) .",
    "we say that @xmath29 * integrates * the poisson manifold @xmath18 .",
    "a morphism of symplectic groupoids is a morphism of groupoids that is a symplectomorphism .",
    "let us write @xmath35 for the category of symplectic groupoids and symplectic groupoid morphisms ( i.e. symplectomorphisms that also are groupoid morphisms ) .",
    "as in the category of poisson manifolds , the cartesian product of manifolds endows the category of symplectic groupoids with a symmetric monoidal structure .",
    "one also defines the * dual symplectic groupoid * @xmath36 of a symplectic groupoid @xmath37 as the the symplectic groupoid @xmath38 ( which can also be obtained by interchanging the source and target while `` reversing '' the product law ) . if the symplectic groupoid integrates @xmath3 , its dual integrates @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , if the symplectic groupoid @xmath29 integrates the poisson manifold @xmath40 and the symplectic groupoid @xmath41 integrates the poisson manifold @xmath42 , then the symplectic groupoid product @xmath43 integrates the poisson manifold product @xmath44 .",
    "not all poisson manifolds can be integrated by symplectic groupoids .",
    "the ones which can are called * integrable*. all the source @xmath45-connected symplectic groupoids integrating an integrable poisson manifold are isomorphic to the one resulting from the following construction in terms of homotopy classes of paths @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 be an integrable poisson manifold .",
    "consider the space @xmath46 of cotangent paths ; that is , the set of paths @xmath47\\rightarrow{{t}^*}a$ ] such that @xmath48 where @xmath49\\rightarrow a$ ] is the base map .",
    "the source @xmath45-connected symplectic groupoid of @xmath18 can be realized as the quotient of the set of cotangent paths by a homotopy relation @xmath50 that fixes the end - points of the @xmath51-component of the cotangent path ( see @xcite for a definition of this relation ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 this quotient and by @xmath53 $ ] the homotopy class of @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath52 is a symplectic groupoid over @xmath3 whose source and target maps @xmath55 are given by the endpoints of the path projection on the base : @xmath56)=x(0)$ ] and @xmath57)=x(1)$ ] .",
    "the groupoid product is given by concatenation of paths @xmath53[g']=[gg']$ ] , where @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] are two representatives whose ends @xmath57)=s([g'])$ ] match smoothly and where @xmath60 from now on , we will reserve the notation @xmath61 for the source @xmath45-connected symplectic groupoid integrating @xmath18 coming from the construction above .",
    "note that @xmath52 always exists but not necessarily as a manifold : for non - integrable poisson manifolds , @xmath52 can be realized as a stack ( see @xcite )      let us fix here a coherent notation for the various categories we will be dealing with .",
    "first of all , we have the following :    * @xmath62 is the usual symplectic category of symplectic manifolds and symplectomorphisms , * @xmath63 is the extended symplectic `` category '' , where symplectomorphisms are replaced by canonical relations .",
    "while the former is an honest category , the latter is not : the composition of two canonical relations may fail to produce again a canonical relation .",
    "there are two honest categories obtained by considering symplectic _ microfolds _ instead of symplectic _ manifolds _ ( see @xcite for more details)_. _    a * symplectic microfold * @xmath64 $ ] is a germ of a symplectic manifold @xmath1 around a lagrangian submanifold @xmath65 called the * core * of the microfold .",
    "a * symplectic micromorphism * @xmath66,\\phi):[m , a]\\rightarrow[n , b]$ ] between two symplectic microfolds is a germ @xmath67 $ ] of a canonical relation @xmath68 around the graph of a smooth map @xmath9 , that intersects the core @xmath13 _ cleanly _ in @xmath23 ( this definition is not the original one given in @xcite but an equivalent one as stated in ( * ? ? ?",
    "we denote by    * @xmath69 the category of symplectic microfolds and germs of symplectomorphisms , * @xmath70 the category of the symplectic microfolds and symplectic micromorphisms .",
    "we call this last category the * microsymplectic category . *",
    "each of the categories above is symmetric monoidal .",
    "the symmetric monoidal structure for @xmath62 and @xmath69 comes from the usual cartesian product of sets and maps , while the symmetries @xmath71 are given by the usual factor permutations @xmath72 .    as for @xmath63 ,",
    "the symmetric monoidal structure comes from the one on the category of sets and _ binary relations _ :",
    "the tensor product on objects is still given by the cartesian product of the underlying sets , while the tensor product between a canonical relation @xmath73 from @xmath1 to @xmath74 and a canonical relation from @xmath75 to @xmath76 is the canonical relation @xmath77 from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ; i.e. , the canonical relation @xmath80 with the middle factors permuted .",
    "the symmetries are given by the graphs of the factor permutations @xmath81 the unit object @xmath82 is the one - point symplectic manifold , which we will also denote by @xmath83 .",
    "we obtain the symmetric monoidal structure in the microsymplectic category by going to the representatives .",
    "the tensor product of two symplectic microfolds is given by the usual cartesian product of their underlying representatives : @xmath84\\otimes[n , b]:=[m\\times n , a\\times b].\\ ] ] the tensor product of two symplectic micromorphisms is simply @xmath85,\\phi)\\otimes([w],\\psi):=([v\\otimes w],\\phi\\times\\psi),\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the tensor product of the canonical relation representatives as above .",
    "again , the symmetries are given by the graphs of the factor permutation maps .",
    "for the unit object @xmath82 , we can take the symplectic microfold associated with the cotangent bundle of the one - point manifold @xmath87 .",
    "observe that , in the microsymplectic category , there is only one morphism from the unit object to any given symplectic microfold : @xmath88,\\ , pr_{a}):\\ ; e\\rightarrow[m , a],\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the unique map from @xmath3 to the one - point manifold .",
    "each of the symplectic categories considered in the previous paragraph is symmetric monoidal , and thus possesses an associated category of monoids .",
    "recall that a * monoid object * ( or monoid for short ) in a monoidal category @xmath90 with neutral object @xmath91 is a triple @xmath92 consisting of an object @xmath17 , a morphism @xmath93 , called the product , and a morphism @xmath94 , called the unit .",
    "these morphisms satisfy the associativity and unitality axioms : i.e. , respectively , @xmath95 a * monoid morphism * from a monoid object @xmath96 to a monoid object @xmath97 is a morphism @xmath98 that respects the products and the units : i.e. , @xmath99 the monoid objects in @xmath100 together with the monoid morphisms form a category @xmath101 . in the sequel",
    ", we will be particularly interested in @xmath102 , which is only a `` category '' , and its micro - version @xmath103 , which is an honest category .",
    "the category of monoids in a symmetric monoidal category @xmath104 is again monoidal symmetric .",
    "the tensor product on objects is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 while the tensor product on monoid morphisms is the tensor product of the underlying morphisms in @xmath100 .",
    "since a monoidal category comes with an isomorphism @xmath107 , the unit object in @xmath100 is also the unit object in its category of monoids .",
    "symplectic groupoids were first introduced as a potential tool to be used along with geometric quantization in order to construct star products for poisson manifolds ( @xcite ) .",
    "namely , geometric quantization establishes a dictionary between symplectic geometry and linear algebra is a set of vectors in @xmath108 unless @xmath109 is `` enhanced '' by a half density . for simplicity , we leave aside this aspect of the discussion , and we refer the reader to @xcite for a full account . ]",
    "@xmath110 implying the additional entry @xmath111 this suggests the possibility of a monoidal `` functor '' @xmath112 ( the quotation marks remind us that the source of this `` functor '' is only a `` category '' ) , which would induce a `` functor '' between the corresponding categories of monoids @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the category of monoids in @xmath115 , or , in other words , the category of unital associative algebras and unital algebra maps over @xmath116 .    now , the product graph @xmath117 of a symplectic groupoid @xmath29 together with its unit space @xmath3 ( regarded as a canonical relation from the one - point symplectic manifold to @xmath30 ) produces a monoid object @xmath118 in the symplectic `` category '' .",
    "the image of this monoid object by @xmath76 should yield a unital associative algebra @xmath119 , which is to be thought of as the quantum algebra that quantizes the poisson manifold @xmath18 induced by the symplectic groupoid .",
    "the strategy above has been carried out successfully in some concrete examples and special classes of integrable poisson manifolds ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , with this approach ( as opposed to deformation quantization for instance ) , non integrable poisson manifolds are discarded from the start , and functoriality issues , due to the ill - behaved composition of canonical relations , have to be faced .",
    "as we shall see in the coming sections , the use of the microsymplectic category improves the situation in these respects .",
    "namely , any monoidal functor @xmath120 respecting duals and tensor products , would yield a general quantization scheme for poisson manifolds .",
    "the question of the functoriality of these quantization schemes is closely related to the possibility of enlarging the category of local symplectic groupoids into a category allowing us to regard the integration of poisson manifolds by local symplectic groupoids as a functor .",
    "in fact , these ideas point to a local version of the early work of zakrzewski @xcite and the more recent symplectization `` functor '' studied by fernandes in @xcite in the global case .",
    "let us conclude this paragraph by mentioning yet another way to circumvent the functorial issues raised by the ill - defined composition of canonical relations . instead of the microsymplectic category , one could use the ww - category introduced by wehrheim and woodward in @xcite , which contains and enlarges the symplectic `` category '' so as to obtain an honest category .",
    "a symplectic groupoid can be then identified with a monoid object ( endowed with some additional structures such as a @xmath121-operation as in zakrzewski @xcite ) in this category .",
    "the extended symplectic `` category '' can be used as a target category to `` symplectify '' poisson geometry via the symplectization `` functor '' as studied by fernandes in @xcite .",
    "the general idea is to replace an integrable poisson manifold @xmath18 by its source 1-connected symplectic groupoid @xmath61 as described in the previous section .",
    "a poisson map @xmath122 is then replaced by the lagrangian subgroupoid @xmath123 that integrates the graph of @xmath124 regarded as a coisotropic submanifold of @xmath125 .",
    "this yields a `` functor '' @xmath126 from the category of _ integrable _ poisson manifolds ( i.e. the poisson manifolds that have a symplectic groupoid integrating them ) to the extended symplectic `` category '' : the symplectization functor .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 on morphisms rests on the following facts ( see @xcite ) :    * let @xmath29 be a source @xmath45-connected symplectic groupoid over the poisson manifold @xmath3 and let @xmath127 be a ( immersed ) subgroupoid of @xmath29 , then @xmath17 is a coisotropic submanifold of @xmath3 ; conversely , there is a unique ( immersed ) source 1-connected lagrangian subgroupoid that has a given coisotropic submanifold as its unit space ; * a smooth map @xmath9 between the poisson manifolds @xmath3 and @xmath27 is poisson iff its graph is a coisotropic submanifold of @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , we define the value of @xmath0 on a poisson map @xmath9 to be the unique lagrangian subgroupoid @xmath129 of the symplectic groupoid product @xmath130 that integrates the coisotropic submanifold @xmath23 of the poisson manifold @xmath131 .    actually , there is a better suited `` category '' than @xmath63 as target category for the symplectization `` functor '' .",
    "namely , consider the `` category '' @xmath132 whose objects are the source @xmath45-connected symplectic groupoids .",
    "a morphism from @xmath29 to @xmath41 is a lagrangian subgroupoid @xmath127 of the symplectic groupoid product @xmath133 .",
    "the composition is given by the composition of the canonical relations @xmath109 underlying the morphisms @xmath127 .",
    "the symplectization functor as defined above suffers from two major problems : it is only a `` functor '' and it is relevant only for the class of integrable poison manifolds . in order to define an honest symplectization functor whose domain is the category of _ all _ poisson manifolds , we need to consider the integration of poisson manifolds by _ local _ symplectic groupoids instead of global ones .",
    "what changes now is that _ every _ poisson manifold can be integrated by a local symplectic groupoid ( @xcite ) , or more conveniently , by a _",
    "symplectic microgroupoid_.    recall that a local groupoid @xmath29 is , roughly , a groupoid whose structure maps are defined only in a neighborhood of the unit space ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "two local groupoids over @xmath3 coinciding on a ( smaller ) neighborhood of @xmath3 are equivalent for most purposes .",
    "thus , the relevant information is really contained in the `` groupoid germ '' induced by the local groupoids . we are led to the following definition :    a ( symplectic ) microgroupoid @xmath134\\rightrightarrows a$ ] over @xmath3 is an equivalence class of local ( symplectic ) groupoids over @xmath3 .",
    "a ( lagrangian ) submicrogroupoid @xmath135\\rightrightarrows c$ ] of a ( symplectic ) microgroupoid @xmath134\\rightrightarrows a$ ] is a ( lagrangian ) submicrofold @xmath135 $ ] in @xmath134 $ ] such that it is also a submicrogroupoids over @xmath17 .",

    "the following example illustrates the fact that , even though a monoid object in the extended symplectic category may not arise from a symplectic groupoid , its restriction to a ( micro ) neighborhood of its unit space yields a monoid object in the microsymplectic category , which itself comes from a symplectic microgroupoid .",

    ".    we can extract the source and target maps from the fact that the composition of symplectic micromorphisms is always monic ( see @xcite ) when applied to the compositions involved in the unitality axiom .",
    "namely , consider the reduction @xmath294 associated with the composition @xmath295 the monicity of the composition can be expressed by saying that the restriction @xmath296 of @xmath232 to @xmath297 is a diffeomorphism on its image @xmath298 .",
    "now , using the identification @xmath299 , the restriction @xmath296 reads @xmath300 taking the inverse of @xmath296 on its image ( which is the diagonal in @xmath301 by the unitality axiom ) , we obtain a smooth surjective map @xmath33 for which @xmath302 is the unique element in @xmath3 such that @xmath303 in other words , we have obtained the source map of the local symplectic groupoid . the same line of argument for the other composition @xmath304 delivers the target map @xmath34 .",
