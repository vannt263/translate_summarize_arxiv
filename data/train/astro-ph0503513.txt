    "it is generally accepted that the galaxy distribution in rich clusters of galaxies closely follows the dark matter distribution . in other words the number density of galaxies observed in clusters is well described by a navarro , frenk and white profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "this behaviour is established by observations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) as well as theoretical investigations ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in contradiction to these outcomes the number density profile of the galaxies in the ngc 5044 group shows a flattening towards the centre , which is not in agreement with the standard nfw profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ngc 5044 group of galaxies resembles closely the properties of fossil groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "the central elliptical galaxy in ngc 5044 , with luminosity @xmath5 is surrounded by @xmath0 known dwarf satellites ( @xcite ) . at a distance of @xmath6 ( e.g. @xcite ) the absolute magnitudes of the non - central galaxies range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 . about @xmath10 per cent of the group members appear to be spheroidal or de galaxies .",
    "the basic differences between the dark matter substructure ( subhalo ) distribution and the smoothly distributed component of cosmic matter assemblies is that substructures lose mass due to tidal forces and are affected by dynamical friction , whereas these two mechanisms have no impact on the smooth component .",
    "both of these mechanisms can cause differences between the substructure distribution and the smoothly distributed matter component in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "thus it is noteworthy that the galaxy number density profiles in rich clusters are in good agreement with the smooth density distribution .",
    "dynamical friction and tidal mass loss seem to balance each other . both mechanisms acting at the same time result in a distribution of the substructures which resembles the underlying smooth distribution .",
    "however , the radial number density profile of satellite galaxies in the ngc 5044 group does not follow the underlying matter distribution .",
    "we estimate the expected radial distribution of galaxies in ngc 5044 by following the orbits in the time dependent potential well of the hosting halo .",
    "since the masses of the dark halos that initially surround the stellar component of the satellites are not known well , we treat their _ total to stellar mass ratio _ ( @xmath11 ) as a parameter in our computations . a second parameter which goes into the integration of the orbits",
    "is the _ disruption radius _ @xmath12 .",
    "satellite halos that are truncated by tides down to this radius are assumed to reduce below the luminosity limit of the observations .",
    "we will show that the number density profile of the ngc 5044 galaxy population can be explained by the action of dynamical friction and tidal forces if total disruption of galaxies is allowed .",
    "when tidal disruption is considered it is no longer necessary to assume , as @xcite have done , that the radial number density profile of satellite galaxies in ngc 5044 group requires an inherent deficiency of dwarf satellite galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the tidally stripped stars may affect the intragroup medium , in particular the abundance of heavy elements ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . ",
    "[ sec : model ] focuses on the integration of the galaxy orbits within the time dependent potential well of the hosting halo . in   [ sec : profiles ] the number density profiles of the resulting satellite distribution at @xmath13 for different sets of parameters are discussed .",
    "  [ sec : balance ] investigates in detail the impact of dynamical friction versus tidal disruption . ",
    "[ sec : con ] summarises the results obtained .",
    "the model discussed here is a derivative of the model presented by @xcite .",
    "very recently @xcite demonstrated that this kind of semi - analytical model shows good agreement with state of the art n - body simulations .",
    "similar approaches have been used for a variety of scientific goals , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the local space density of satellite galaxies is assumed to be proportional to that of the total gravitating matter , as if a fixed fraction of baryons formed into low - luminosity galaxies at a very early time .",
    "thus the number of galaxies that have entered the virial radius of the host halo at a given time is proportional to the total amount of mass accreted at that time .",
    "host and satellite halos are modelled according to findings of @xcite .",
    "a random b - band luminosity is assigned to every satellite galaxy in such a way , that their luminosity distribution matches the distribution observed in ngc 5044 .",
    "after a galaxy has entered the virial radius of the ngc 5044 group for the first time , its orbit is followed in the growing potential well of the host .",
    "the integration scheme takes dynamical friction and tidal mass loss into account .",
    "satellites are assumed to be lost if their tidal radius falls below a certain radius . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all stars are formed at redshift @xmath14 ( we also employed @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which does not change the overall picture ) .",
    "dark matter halos formed at that epoch have central densities comparable to that of the stellar densities observed .",
    "the underlying cosmology is the presently favoured concordance model with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , a hubble constant of @xmath19 and a normalisation of the power spectrum of @xmath20 .      following the analysis of @xcite the mass growth of the hosting halo",
    "can be described by @xmath21 where @xmath22 defines the halo formation time .",
    "the expansion factor @xmath23 at the time of formation for ngc 5044 can be estimated by @xmath24 if at present time @xmath25 a concentration of @xmath26 is assumed and @xmath27 is set to @xmath28 ( @xcite ) the expansion factor at formation turns out to be @xmath29 which translates into a formation redshift of @xmath30 . knowing the evolution of mass ( eq .  [ equ : evoma ] ) and",

    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 is a outcome of the spherical collapse approximation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it gives the virialised overdensity with respect to the critical density @xmath33 at that epoch .",
    "@xmath34 is the time dependent mass specified in eq .",
    "[ equ : evoma ] . with the above recipe the dark matter profile and the gravitational potential of the host can be computed for any radius and redshift .",
    "the orbits of the satellite halos are computed within this potential well .",
    "we assume that all satellite galaxies form at the same early redshift @xmath35 and that their space density is proportional to that of the dark matter .",
    "thus the satellites enter the host halo at the same rate as the dark matter . with this simple model the host mass @xmath36 when the ith satellite first entered the virial radius of the host can be found from @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a random number and",
    "@xmath39 @xmath40 is the current virial mass of the ngc 5044 group .",

    "[ equ : evorv ] .",
    "the velocity of the galaxy at the virial radius is the free - fall velocity from the turnaround radius @xmath43 . @xmath44",
    "the stellar mass of the ith galaxy is @xmath45 here the galactic luminosity is randomly selected from the power law part of the schechter luminosity function @xmath46 ( which is satisfied in ngc 5044 ) : @xmath47^{-5}\\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 is another random ( @xmath38 ) . for the stellar mass to light ratio @xmath51 in eq .",

    "thus it is reasonable to embed them into a dark matter halo .",
    "since the ratio between total and stellar matter in isolated dwarf galaxies is not well determined , we introduce a parameter @xmath53 which allows us to vary the star formation efficiency .",
    "the total mass of the satellite including the dark matter halo is then given by @xmath54 the density profile of all matter components - dark , stellar and gaseous - is assumed to follow a nfw - profile which is in agreement with recent studies by @xcite who showed that the density profiles of dwarf ( n - body ) halos are well fitted by nfw - profiles .",
    "the concentration of each satellite halo accreting at redshift @xmath41 is computed by means of eq .",
    "[ equ : evoco ] . for this purpose @xmath55 has to be interpreted as the expansion factor at arrival ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath23 corresponds to the formation redshift of the halo @xmath57 .",
    "as mentioned above , the choice of different formation redshifts @xmath58 , has marginal influence on the results .",
    "subsequently , we assume @xmath59 for the global formation redshift of the satellite halos .",
    "this simplifications do not pay tribute to the dissipative baryonic processes , like radiation or adiabatic contraction ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . due to these processes",
    "the central parts of the satellite halos might be more tightly bound and the total tidal destruction might become more difficult .",
    "this shortcoming can be compensated by the variation of the the second parameter introduced here , the _ disruption radius _ @xmath12 .",
    "if the tidal forces manage to strip the outer matter shells down to this radius , the satellite galaxy is assumed to vanish , i.e. fall below optical observability .",
    "we adjust this parameter to reach agreement with the global satellite distribution observed in ngc 5044 , without tackling the complex processes close to the halo centre .",
    "we integrate the orbits of each satellite galaxy starting at the virial radius when the satellite first enters the virialised halo of the host .",
    "the absolute value of the initial velocity is computed under the assumption that the satellite has experienced free - fall from twice the virial radius , eq .  [ equ : vinit ] .",
    "the absolute value of the velocity is distributed to a radial and a tangential component .",
    "the tangential component is assigned in accordance with the results by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "he gives a distribution of circularity @xmath60 of dark matter particles at the virial radius .",

    "the resulting distribution is @xmath67 where @xmath68 the results of tormen suggest that @xmath69 , for which @xmath66 becomes a symmetric quadratic .",
    "the orbits of the satellites are found by solving @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the nfw mass within the radius @xmath72 of the host halo at that time .",

    "we assume that the total dispersion can be approximated by the cold dark matter dispersion presented by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we choose @xmath79 as suggested by @xcite which is the point mass approximation .",
    "this approximation is justified by the very efficient tidal mass stripping which effectively truncates the radius of the satellite halo .",
    "the tidal truncation radius is estimated by the jacobi limit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath80 here @xmath81 is the distance of the satellite to the centre of the group , @xmath82 is the mass of the host within @xmath81 and @xmath83 is the current mass of the halo",
    ". if the resulting truncation radius @xmath84 is smaller than the current radius of the satellite halo , then the truncation radius is assumed to be the current halo radius and all the matter outside of @xmath84 is stripped instantaneously . in our model a minimum disruption radius @xmath12 is introduced .",
    "if the truncation radius falls below this radius the satellite s luminosity is assumed to fall below observability .",
    "we will show models for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . for @xmath87",
    "all the satellites survive .",
    "for comparison the effective radius of the lowest luminosity dwarfs in ngc 5044 is approximately @xmath3 .",
    "we do not allow a change of the density or velocity profile of the satellite halo following the truncation .",
    "@xcite have shown that a cuspy density profile remains after mass is lost by tidal forces .",
    "however , tidal heating ( see e.g. @xcite ) may reduce the central density and therefore reduce the mass contained within the truncation radius .",
    "in fact by means of n - body simulations @xcite and @xcite have shown that some mass is lost even within the tidal radius of sub - halos orbiting in the potential well of a host halo .",
    "@xcite compare different estimators for the truncation radius , concluding that the jacoby limit most accurately estimates this additional tidal mass loss .",
    "therefore we apply the jacoby limit .",
    "nevertheless , due to the dense baryonic cores , more mass may be retained than estimated from pure n - body investigations .",
    "we assume that the net trend of the different processes can be represented by an appropriate choice of the disruption radius @xmath12 that generates the final observed number distribution .",
    "since the force exerted by dynamical friction is proportional to the mass squared , tidal mass loss strongly reduces the impact of dynamical friction .",
    "in this section we present the resulting number density profiles for different sets of parameters . as mentioned above we use only two parameters , firstly the initial total to stellar mass ratio @xmath88 to vary the contribution of the cold dark matter halo , secondly the disruption radius @xmath12 which modulates the destruction rate due to tidal forces . fig .",
    "[ fig : zfor07 ] shows the results for four different tidal disruption / destruction efficiencies .",
    "the upper left panel displays the radial distribution resulting from dynamical friction without tidal mass loss .",
    "this scenario is rather unphysical since observations ( e.g.@xcite ) and n - body simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) have proven that tidal mass loss is significant .",
    "however it is interesting to note that the different masses of the satellite halos due to different @xmath88-values do not result in greatly different profiles .",
    "all profiles fall a little below the projected nfw - profile and are equally discrepant when compared to the observations .",
    "dynamical friction shifts the whole distribution inwards without seriously affecting the overall shape .    the upper panel on the right in fig .",
    "[ fig : zfor07 ] shows the resulting distribution if tidal mass loss is allowed but total tidal destruction is not allowed ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this prescription is similar to the treatment of the cluster galaxies in @xcite . in agreement with their findings",
    "the galaxy number density profile follows closely the nfw - profile ( at least within the @xmath90 of the virial radius ) .",
    "however the resulting profiles are not in agreement with observations of ngc 5044 .",
    "this difference emphasises that the shallow potential wells of the faint dwarf galaxies in ngc 5044 must be considered .",
    "observations addressing the dwarf populations in clusters of galaxies suggest that the dwarf galaxies can be strongly affected by tidal forces . according to @xcite and",
    "@xcite the decreasing dwarf - to - giant ratio with increasing surface density in clusters of galaxies indicates that the high density environments are hostile to dwarf galaxies .    the lower panels in fig .",

    "only the distribution with @xmath93 matches the observed distribution below @xmath94 .",
    "but the strong increase above @xmath94 and the fact that a mass to light ratio of 1 entirely neglects the contribution of cold dark matter gives evidence against this particular model .",
    "the model profiles in the lower right - hand panel agree with the observation for @xmath95 and @xmath96 below radii of @xmath94 , but obviously exceed the data and the nfw profile for large radii .",
    "( it should be mentioned that the observed distribution is likely to be incomplete at large radii . )",

    "interestingly this @xmath12 turns out to be equal to the effective radius of the faintest galaxies observed in ngc 5044 , if the minimum b - band luminosity @xmath99 is transformed into an effective radius @xmath100 using the relation given in @xcite .",
    "the total to stellar mass ratio which approximates the data best is @xmath101 , or perhaps a bit lower since choosing @xmath102 results in very a similar behaviour .",
    "@xcite have shown that the consideration of the dark matter halo of isolated galaxies leads to @xmath103 for galaxies within the luminosity range of @xmath104 corresponding roughly to @xmath105 .",

    "the bold face line indicates the favoured model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have shown the results for a uniform formation redshift of @xmath113 .",
    "different formation redshifts result in different concentrations of the satellite halos and thus might affect the tidal stripping efficiency .",
    "therefore we have redone the modelling with formation redshifts of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the differences are marginal .",
    "we conclude this section by repeating that the model parameters @xmath101 , @xmath98 and @xmath14 match the data very well .",
    "in this section we show the orbital behaviour of three particular galaxies .",
    "these three cases are chosen to make some of the features discussed above more explicit . in figs .",
    "[ fig : id00071 ] , [ fig : id00025 ] and  [ fig : id00044 ] we compare the behaviour of satellite halos having the same initial conditions with ( solid and dashed lines ) and without ( dotted lines ) tidal mass loss .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the orbits without tidal destruction , whereas the solid line ends ( additionally marked by a second large dot ) when the truncation radius falls below @xmath3 . in these figures",
    "the ratio of the forces due to dynamical friction and gravitation ( @xmath114 ) is plotted versus the distance of the satellite to the centre of the group .",
    "the horizontal line for @xmath115 indicates the threshold where dynamical friction equals the force exerted by gravitation .",
    "once an orbit transgresses above this line , it is dominated by dynamical friction and the galaxy drops nearly radially toward the centre .",
    "the large , right dot in fig .  [ fig : id00071 ] marks the first passage through the virial radius and therefore the beginning of integration .",
    "after orbiting once around the group centre the satellite moves farther outwards bacause its initial velocity was the free - fall velocity from twice the virial radius .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit without tidal stripping ( dotted line ) changes from initially @xmath116 to a final value of @xmath117 .",
    "interestingly the contribution of friction to the total force shows a minimum for intermediate radii and rises again if the satellite moves further out .",
    "dynamical friction is not negligible during the apo - centre passage . for small velocities",
    "@xmath114 is roughly proportional to @xmath118 , where @xmath72 is the distance to the group centre and @xmath119 is absolute values of the velocity .",
    "frictional decay of the tangential velocity at apo - centre leads to more radial orbits , if tidal mass loss is not taken into account .",
    "furthermore the computed orbit indicates that satellites can first transgress the @xmath120 line during their apo - centre passage . in that case",
    "all the angular momentum of the satellite is lost and it approaches the centre on a pure radial orbit .",
    "such an orbit might be appropriate for a massive black hole that experiences dynamical friction without tidal losses .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit with tidal stripping ( solid / dashed line ) stays @xmath121 all the time .",
    "this is due to that fact that tidal stripping reduces the action of dynamical friction .",
    "most of the mass is lost during the first infall , as can be inferred by the shallow slope till the first peri - centre passage .",
    "the large , left dot indicates where the tidal destruction is assumed by our approach .",
    "here @xmath122 was chosen .",
    "[ fig : id00071 ] shows that after @xmath123 orbits the satellite is destroyed at a distance @xmath124 from the centre , which is quite close to the central elliptical galaxy .    the orbit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : id00025 ] has a similar behaviour , but differs from the previous orbit in that the satellite is not destroyed by tidal forces ( no second large dot ) . without tidal",
    "stripping and mass loss ( dotted line ) the satellite halo eventually falls toward the group centre as indicated by the final passage above the @xmath120 line .",
    "this catastrophic loss of angular momentum by dynamical friction occurs during an apo - centre passage . when all its orbital angular momentum is lost , the satellite approaches the centre on a radial orbit starting at @xmath125 from the centre .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit without tidal stripping changes from @xmath126 to @xmath117 , whereas the orbit with tidal mass loss retains its initially eccentricity of @xmath126 .",
    "[ fig : id00044 ] is an example for a very radial orbit in which the eccentricity remains at @xmath127 for all orbits , either with or without tidal mass loss .",
    "the large initial radius @xmath128 indicates that the satellite approaches rather late , that means the potential well of the hosting group is already very deep .",
    "the large , left dot marks the destruction during the first peri - centre passage , if tidal stripping and destruction are allowed ( @xmath98 ) . for this particular case , which is rather extreme , the fast destruction seems reliable , since the satellite is falling from @xmath129 ( twice the virial radius at epoch of entry ) down to @xmath130 which is very close to the central elliptical galaxy .",
    "the detailed analysis of the individual orbits clearly demonstrates that the influence of dynamical friction is largely reduced by tidal mass loss .",
    "the estimation of the tidal radius by the jacobi limit and the instantaneous stripping up to this radius lead to a rapid decrease of the halo mass during the first infall . the instantaneous stripping description might reduce the mass a bit to fast , but after very few orbits the jacobi radius should be a good approximation . on subsequent orbits dynamical friction tends to push the halo closer to the centre which is accompanied by further tidal mass loss , since the tidal radius of the halo is proportional to its distance from the centre .",
    "the force exerted by dynamical friction is proportional to the halo mass squared , thus the loss of mass reduces the impact of friction further . in conclusion",
    "the dominant process for shaping the inner number density profile of groups like ngc 5044 is tidal disruption and/or destruction .",
    "using a simple model we find that the interplay between dynamical friction and tidal disruption can explain the shallow slope of the projected number density profiles of satellite galaxies of the fossil group ngc 5044 .",
    "the strong deviation of observed satellite galaxies from nfw profiles is a result of the tidal disruption of the stellar cores of galaxies orbiting closer to the group centre .",
    "this feature may be more naturally explained in this manner than by assuming an absence of dwarf galaxies at high redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use two parameters to model the observed dwarf galaxy distribution : the total to stellar mass ratio @xmath88 and the disruption radius @xmath12 . with parameters @xmath131 and @xmath132 the model",
    "can match the observed projected radial number distribution in ngc 5044 very well .",
    "@xmath131 is in good agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "they show that the @xmath133 of isolated galaxies with b - band luminosities of @xmath134 is in the range between 100 and 150 . for @xmath101",
    "we obtain @xmath135 . if we use the @xmath136 relation presented by @xcite to compute the effective radius for our lowest luminosity model galaxies ( @xmath137 ) we obtain @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , the global galaxy distribution in ngc 5044 seems to favour a destruction radius that is close to the minimal @xmath100 of the group satellites .",
    "we find that the total luminosity of the tidally disrupted galaxies is about twice the luminosity of the central elliptical or @xmath139 of the total optical light of the group , allowing for incompleteness of identified satellite galaxies .",
    "this indicates that a large fraction of satellite stars are scattered into the intragroup medium by tidal forces . using the near - infrared @xmath140-band properties of clusters @xcite estimate that a large fraction ( @xmath141 ) of the total stellar luminosity is contributed by intracluster light",
    "this fraction increases with cluster mass .",
    "@xcite searched the fornax cluster for novae in between the galaxies and find that @xmath142 of the total cluster light comes from the intracluster stars .",
