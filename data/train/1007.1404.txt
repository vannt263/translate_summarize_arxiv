    "multifractal behavior has been observed in a wide variety of physical systems , from turbulence @xcite to the stock market @xcite and cloud images @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized recently that such a behavior can also be visible in quantum wave functions of certain systems . in particular ,",
    "wave functions in the anderson model of electrons in a disordered potential are multifractal at the metal - insulator transition ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similar behaviors were seen in quantum hall transitions @xcite and in random matrix models such as the power law random banded matrix model ( prbm ) @xcite and ultrametric random matrices @xcite .",
    "such properties have also been seen in diffractive systems @xcite and pseudointegrable models , for which there are constants of motion , but where the dynamics takes place in surfaces more complicated than the invariant tori of integrable systems @xcite . in all these models ,",
    "this behavior of wave functions came with a specific type of spectral statistics , intermediate between the wigner distribution typical of chaotic systems and the poisson distribution characteristic of integrable systems @xcite .",
    "recently , a new model of one - dimensional quantum `` intermediate map '' which displays multifractal behavior was proposed @xcite , and a version with random phases was shown semi - rigorously to display intermediate statistics @xcite .",
    "this model is especially simple to handle numerically and analytically , and displays different regimes of multifractality depending on a parameter @xcite . in parallel ,",
    "new experiments allowed recently to observe the anderson transition with cold atoms in an optical potential @xcite using a one - dimensional `` anderson map '' proposed in @xcite .",
    "although much progress has been made in the study of these peculiar types of systems , several important questions related to multifractality remain unanswered . in particular ,",
    "many results were derived or conjectured in the framework of the anderson model , and their applicability to other families of systems is not known . also , the precise link between the multifractal properties of wave functions and the spectral statistics is not elucidated .    in order to shed some light on these questions",
    ", we systematically investigate several properties of the wave functions of the intermediate quantum map of @xcite , and compare them to results obtained for the anderson map .",
    "in these one - dimensional systems , wave functions of very large vector sizes can be obtained and averaged over many realizations .",
    "this enables to control the errors and evaluate the reliability of standard methods used in multifractal analysis .",
    "this also allows to check and discuss several important conjectures put forth in the context of anderson transitions .",
    "our results also enable to study the road to asymptotic behavior in such models , giving hints on which quantities are more prone to finite - size effects or can be visible only with a very large number of random realizations .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the known facts and conjectures about quantum multifractal systems , which were mainly put forth in the context of the anderson transition . in section iii",
    ", we present the models that will be studied throughout the paper .",
    "section iv discusses the numerical methods used in order to extract multifractal properties of the models .",
    "section v presents the results of numerical simulations , allowing first to compare the different numerical methods of section iv , and then to test the conjectures and results developed in the context of the anderson transition to the two families of models at hand .",
    "we first recall some basic facts about multifractal analysis .",
    "localization properties of wave functions of components @xmath0 , @xmath1 , in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath2 , can be analyzed by means of their moments @xmath3 the asymptotic behavior of the moments for large @xmath2 is governed by a set of multifractal exponents @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 , or by the associated set of multifractal dimensions @xmath6 .",
    "equivalently , the singularity spectrum @xmath7 characterizes the fractal dimensions of the set of points @xmath8 where the weights @xmath9 scale as @xmath10 .",
    "it is related to the multifractal exponents @xmath4 by a legendre transform @xmath11    compared to classical multifractal analysis , the quantum wave functions in hilbert space of increasing dimensions are considered as the same distribution at smaller and smaller scales .",
    "this allows to define properly the multifractality of quantum wave functions , although at a given dimension they correspond to a finite vector .    in many physical instances ,",
    "only a single realization of the wave function is considered . however , as soon as several realizations are considered , as is the case in presence of disorder , the moments are distributed according to a certain probability distribution , and multifractal exponents depend on the way ensemble averages are performed , and in particular on the treatment of the tail of the moments distribution .",
    "if the tail decreases exponentially or even algebraically with a large exponent , the two averages should give the same answer .",
    "on the other hand , if the moments decrease according to a power - law with a small exponent , the average @xmath12 will be dominated by rare wave functions with much larger moments ( whose magnitude directly depends on the number of eigenvectors considered ) , while the quantity @xmath13 will correspond to the typical value of the moment for the bulk of the wave functions considered . to each of these possible averaging procedures",
    "corresponds a set of multifractal exponents , defined by @xmath14 as soon as averages over several realizations are made there can be a discrepancy between @xmath4 and @xmath15 .",
    "historically this effect was seen in the context of the anderson transition @xcite and was very recently confirmed by the analytical calculations of @xcite in the same model .",
    "more specifically , it was shown that the distribution of the normalized moments @xmath16 is asymptotically independent of @xmath2 and has a power - law tail @xmath17 for large @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "the multifractal exponents @xmath4 and @xmath15 only coincide over an interval @xmath19 $ ] where @xmath20 . in the case of heavy tails",
    "@xmath21 , the averages @xmath12 and @xmath22 yield different exponents .",
    "this phenomenon has a counterpart in the singularity spectra @xmath7 and @xmath23 . while @xmath23 can not take values below 0 and terminates at points @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , the singularity spectrum @xmath7 continues below zero .",
    "the two spectra coincide over the interval @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "it can be shown that outside the interval @xmath19 $ ] the set of exponents @xmath15 are given by the linear relation @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", it was stated that the exponents @xmath31 and @xmath15 can be related through the following relation which depends on the tail exponent of the moments distribution @xmath32 : @xmath33 equation was analytically proven for prbm @xcite for integer values of @xmath32 and also in the limit of large bands for @xmath34 .",
    "it remains unclear to which extent eq .",
    "is valid for other types of systems .",
    "a consequence of the identity for @xmath35 is that @xmath36 . in the regime of weak multifractality where @xmath37 is a linear function",
    ", the identity implies that @xmath38 for @xmath39 @xcite(see subsection v.e . for details ) .    finally ,",
    "a further relation that we wish to investigate in the present paper has been predicted based on the nonlinear sigma model and observed in the 3d anderson model at criticality and several other systems .",
    "it is a symmetry relation of multifractal exponents @xcite , which can be expressed as @xmath40 with @xmath41 . for the singularity spectrum it gives @xmath42 .",
    "the validity of these different relations will be investigated on two particularly simple models of quantum maps that we describe in the next section .",
    "the properties of section [ knownfacts ] have been first observed for wave functions in the 3d anderson model at criticality . in the present paper the first model we will consider is a quantum map whose eigenfunctions display similar multifractal properties in momentum representation .",
    "it corresponds to a quantization of a classical map , defined on the torus by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the momentum variable and @xmath45 the angle variable , while @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the same quantities after one iteration of the map .",
    "the corresponding quantum evolution can be expressed as @xmath48 in operator notation , or equivalently as a @xmath49 matrix in momentum representation : @xmath50 with @xmath51 @xcite . for generic irrational @xmath52 ,",
    "the spectral statistics of @xmath53 are expected to follow random matrix theory .",
    "when @xmath52 is a rational number , @xmath54 with @xmath55 integers , spectral statistics are of intermediate type and eigenvectors of the map display multifractal properties . in order to study the effect of ensemble averaging on multifractal exponents , we will consider a random version introduced in @xcite , where the phases @xmath56 are replaced by independent random phases @xmath57 .",
    "we will also present numerical results obtained for the initial map given by .",
    "an important system where multifractal wave functions have been observed corresponds to electrons in a disordered potential in dimension three .",
    "indeed , the anderson model @xcite which describes such a situation displays a transition between a localized phase ( exponentially localized wave functions ) and a diffusive phase ( ergodic wave functions ) for a critical strength of disorder . at the transition point",
    ", the wave functions display multifractal properties @xcite and the spectral statistics are of the intermediate type @xcite . in order to compare this type of system with the previous one",
    ", we have studied a one - dimensional system with incommensurate frequencies , which has been shown to display an anderson - like transition @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that it can be implemented with cold atoms in an optical lattice , which enables to probe experimentally the anderson transition .",
    "the system is a generalization of the quantum kicked rotator model , and is described by a unitary operator which evolves the system over one time interval :    @xmath58    with @xmath59 ( here time @xmath60 corresponds to number of kicks ) . here @xmath61 and @xmath62 should be two frequencies mutually incommensurate .",
    "following @xcite we chose in the simulations @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the real root of the cubic equation @xmath67 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that this system displays an anderson - like transition at the critical value @xmath68 , but multifractality of this system was up to now not verified .",
    "the function @xmath69 can be chosen either by taking @xmath70 ( free evolution ) or as in the preceding case by replacing this quantity by independent random phases uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath71 .",
    "this is actually what we chose to do in our numerical simulations , in order to increase the stability and accuracy of the numerical results .",
    "as a wave packet spreads slowly at the transition , one has to iterate the map for a long time in order to obtain data on a sufficiently large wave function .",
    "we found that in order to reach vector sizes of order @xmath72 , it was necessary to iterate the map up to @xmath73 .",
    "such values are not realistic for experiments with cold atoms ( limited to a few hundreds kicks ) but allow to obtain more precise results .      in both models",
    "the evolution of the system during one time step has the form of an operator diagonal in momentum ( kinetic term ) times an operator diagonal in position ( kick term ) . in both cases",
    ", it has been common practice in the field to replace the kinetic term by random phases .",
    "this allows to obtain a similar dynamics but with a more generic behavior .",
    "moreover , it enables averages over random phases to be performed , which makes numerical and analytical studies more precise . in contrast , in experiments with cold atoms it is easier to perform iterations with a true kinetic term rather than with random phases . in order to assess the effect of this modification",
    ", we will therefore use both approaches in the study of multifractal properties of wave functions .",
    "many works on multifractal wave functions have focused on eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for the intermediate map , the evolution operator has eigenvectors which can be numerically found and explored .",
    "it is also possible to evolve wave packets , for example initially concentrated on one momentum state , and to study the multifractality of the wave packet as time increases .",
    "this corresponds more closely to what can be explored in experiments . for the intermediate map",
    ", this process can be understood as the dynamics of a superposition of eigenvectors of the evolution operator . however , in the case of the anderson map , the evolution operator is time dependent ( the continuous time problem being not periodic ) , and the connection with eigenvectors is lacking . in the following , we will explore and compare the multifractality of both eigenfunctions and time - evolved wave packets for the intermediate map .",
    "as is well - known , the numerical estimation of multifractal dimensions is very sensitive to finite - size effects . in the present work we have analyzed and compared different numerical methods in order to compute accurately the multifractal exponents . in this section",
    "we briefly review the methods we used .",
    "the most straightforward method is to compute directly the moments of the wave functions through the scaling of the moments given by @xmath74 . if the scaling holds true , then @xmath75 is a linear function of @xmath76 and its slopes yield the exponents @xmath31 . for @xmath77 , coarse - graining over neighboring sites",
    "is necessary in order to avoid instabilities due to very small values of @xmath78 .",
    "a variation of the moment method is the box - counting method .",
    "it consists in taking a vector of fixed size @xmath2 and summing the @xmath9 over boxes of increasing length . if @xmath79 , then we define @xmath80 which corresponds to averaging the measure over boxes of length @xmath81 , @xmath82 . starting from @xmath83 allows to smooth out exceedingly tiny values of @xmath9 which otherwise yield non - accurate estimates of @xmath37 for negative @xmath45 .",
    "the two methods above give similar results , as was also carefully checked for the anderson model in @xcite .",
    "we will therefore in the following present results using the box - counting method to assess the properties of this type of procedures .      recently ,",
    "alternative procedures to compute the multifractal spectrum based on the wavelet transform were developed @xcite .",
    "the wavelets form a basis of functions as does the fourier basis and a function expressed in this new basis gives the wavelet transform ( wt ) . unlike the fourier basis wavelets are localized both in position and in momentum space ( or time and frequency space ) .",
    "they are therefore suitable to probe the local variations of a function at different scales .",
    "they have become an essential tool for image and sound processing and compression .",
    "a wavelet basis is constructed from a single function @xmath84 called analyzing or mother wavelet .",
    "the rest of the basis is constructed by translations and compressions ( expansions ) of the analyzing wavelet @xmath84 .",
    "the translations define a space variable while the compressions define the scale at which the function is analyzed .",
    "we define the wt of a ( real ) function @xmath85 as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the scale variable and @xmath88 is the space variable . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath89 can be interpreted as a measure of how close the function @xmath85 is to the mother wavelet at point @xmath88 and at scale @xmath87 .",
    "the @xmath31 can be extracted from the wt in the following way .",
    "we define the partition function @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the local maxima at scale size @xmath87 and @xmath45 is real .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath31 appears as the exponent in the power law behavior of @xmath92    @xmath93    this is essentially the method known as wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) @xcite .",
    "this method is developed for continuous wavelet function .",
    "if the function @xmath85 is sampled as an @xmath2-dimensional vector with @xmath79 the wavelet transform can be discretized and implemented efficiently by a hierarchical algorithm @xcite resulting in a fast wavelet transform , ( fwt ) .",
    "the scale and space parameters take the values @xmath94 respectively . starting from a wave function @xmath95 and using a proper normalization at each scale , we redefine the partition function as @xmath96^q\\ ] ] where again @xmath91 are the local maxima at scale @xmath87 . as in the continuous case",
    "@xmath92 exhibits the same power law behavior as eq .",
    "( [ powlaw ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we will present results using this implementation of the wavelet method , using the daubechies 4 mother wavelet @xcite .",
    "we note that , although the partition function ( [ zarneomm ] ) is the most standard , recently it was numerically observed @xcite that for a complex multifractal wave function @xmath95 , the exponents @xmath31 can also be obtained from the power law behavior of a modified partition function defined from the complex fwt of @xmath95 and using @xmath97 as exponents in eq .",

    "however , in the case of the anderson map , the uncertainty is too large to give reliable results for @xmath130 . this is certainly due to the fact that both the number of realizations and the vector sizes are smaller in this case , which makes it difficult to find reliable results in the more demanding regime of large negative @xmath45 . in the regime of @xmath141 ,",

    "<S> we study numerically multifractal properties of two models of one - dimensional quantum maps , a map with pseudointegrable dynamics and intermediate spectral statistics , and a map with an anderson - like transition recently implemented with cold atoms . using extensive numerical simulations , we compute the multifractal exponents of quantum wave functions and study their properties , with the help of two different numerical methods used for classical multifractal systems ( box - counting method and wavelet method ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results of the two methods over a wide range of values . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the wave functions of the anderson map display a multifractal behavior similar to eigenfunctions of the three - dimensional anderson transition but of a weaker type . </S>",
    "<S> wave functions of the intermediate map share some common properties with eigenfunctions at the anderson transition ( two sets of multifractal exponents , with similar asymptotic behavior ) , but other properties are markedly different ( large linear regime for multifractal exponents even for strong multifractality , different distributions of moments of wave functions , absence of symmetry of the exponents ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results thus indicate that the intermediate map presents original properties , different from certain characteristics of the anderson transition derived from the nonlinear sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the importance of finite - size effects . </S>"
