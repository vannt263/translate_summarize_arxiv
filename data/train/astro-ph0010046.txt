    "m82 is the prototype starburst galaxy .",
    "observations at all wavelengths from radio to x - rays ( reviewed in telesco 1988 and rieke et al .",
    "1993 ) are consistent with the following scenario . during the last several 100 myr",
    ", tidal interactions between m82 and m81 and/or other member galaxies of the m81 group have channeled large amounts of gas into the central regions of m82 .",
    "this has induced a starburst which has continued for up to about 50 myr at a star formation rate of @xmath8 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 .",
    "energy deposited by supernovae , at a rate of @xmath11 supernova yr@xmath10 ( e.g.  oconnell & mangano 1978 , hereinafter om ; rieke et al .",
    "1980 , mcleod et al .  1993 ) , drives a large - scale galactic wind along the minor axis of m82 ( e.g.  lynds & sandage 1963 , fabbiano & trinchieri 1984 , watson , stanger , & griffiths 1984 , mccarthy , heckman , & van breugel 1987 , shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 , strickland , ponman , & stevens 1997 ) .",
    "all of the bright radio and infrared ( ir ) sources associated with the active starburst are confined to the galaxy s center .",
    "they lie within a radius of @xmath12 pc and mostly suffer heavy extinction by dust , estimated to be in the range @xmath13 525 ( e.g. telesco et al .",
    "1991 , mcleod et al.1993 , satyapal et al .",
    "they correspond spatially with bright optical structures , labeled m82 a , c , and e in om .",
    "these are probably those parts of the starburst core which happen to be the least obscured along the line of sight ( oconnell et al .",
    "1995 ) .    however , there is good photometric and spectroscopic evidence that this was not the only major starburst episode to have occurred in m82 .",
    "a region about 1 kpc ne from the galactic center , m82 b ( cf .",
    "om and fig .",
    "1 ) , has exactly the properties one would predict for a fossil starburst with an amplitude similar to the active burst in m82 a , c and e. m82 b has an intrinsic surface brightness of @xmath14 mag arcsec@xmath15 ( measured in a @xmath16 aperture ) . although this is fainter than the intrinsic _ v_-band surface brightness of m82 a , c , and e in the active starburst , it is nonetheless much higher than the maximum brightnesses encountered in spiral disks , even when seen edge - on . for the disks of typical edge - on sb - sd galaxies , de grijs ( 1998 )",
    "finds central surface brightnesses of order @xmath17 and @xmath18 mag arcsec@xmath15 .",
    "the surface brightness of m82 b is , in fact , comparable to the _ nuclear _ brightnesses of bright sb - sc galaxies measured with similar resolution ( e.g.  de jong 1996 ) . by extrapolating region b s surface brightness back to an age of 10 myr , using the evolutionary synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 1996 )",
    ", we estimate that its surface brightness was of order @xmath19 mag arcsec@xmath15 , similar to that presently observed in the active starburst m82 a.    the spectrum of m82 b is likewise consistent with a fossil starburst event , entirely comparable to that now transpiring in m82 a. it is dominated by balmer absorption lines and shows a large balmer discontinuity ( om , marcum & oconnell 1996 ) .",
    "emission lines are very weak , unlike in m82 a , which has intense line emission .",
    "these are the hallmarks of the anomalous `` e+a '' spectra found in distant galaxy clusters that exhibit the butcher - oemler effect ( butcher & oemler 1978 , oemler 1992 ) .",
    "such spectra are generally interpreted as the signature of a truncated burst of star formation that occurred 1001000 myr earlier ( e.g.  couch & sharples 1987 , dressler & gunn 1990 ) .",
    "these starbursts are thought to be part of the process by which disk galaxies are converted to elliptical or lenticular galaxies and probably result from tidal interactions , mergers , or perhaps ram - pressure stripping by the intergalactic medium ( butcher & oemler 1978 , oemler 1992 , barger et al .",
    "1996 ) . from 2040   resolution",
    "spectrophotometry , om and marcum & oconnell ( 1996 ) find evidence of a sharp main - sequence truncation in m82 b , corresponding to a turnoff age of @xmath20 100200 myr and an average extinction of @xmath21 mag .",
    "region a s spectrum , on the other hand , indicates a very young population ( @xmath22 myr ) and is more heavily affected by extinction ( @xmath23 mag ) .",
    "apart from the physical properties of m82 b , three other considerations support the notion that multiple starbursts have occurred in m82 .",
    "first , the triggering gravitational interactions between m82 and other members of the m81 group and the associated tidal gas flows have been proceeding for more than 200 myr ( e.g.  yun , ho , & lo 1994 ) , in which time multiple starbursts could easily have occurred .",
    "second , starbursts are unlikely to be synchronized throughout the disturbed galaxy , and satyapal et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find evidence of outward propagation of star formation in the dense core of m82 .",
    "finally , it is likely that starbursts are strongly self - limited , or quenched , by supernova - driven outflows , which remove the remaining cool gas from the immediate starburst region ( e.g.  chevalier & clegg 1985 , doane & mathews 1993 ) .",
    "the remarkable minor - axis wind in m82 is a dramatic example of this process .",
    "however , the disturbed conditions near an early burst may discourage re - ignition at the same site when cool gas inflows resume , shifting the location of active star formation .",
    "although other interesting examples of relatively nearby post - starburst systems have been located ( e.g.  vigroux , boulade , & rose 1989 , oegerle , hill , & hoessel 1991 , caldwell et al .",
    "1993 , caldwell & rose 1997 ) none of these , nor any other nearby starburst , offer the opportunity to study two discrete starbursts at such close range as m82 .",
    "the active starburst in the inner 250 pc of m82 has been studied thoroughly , whereas the fossil starburst in region b has not received much attention .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the remains of this earlier episode in detail , with emphasis on young star cluster candidates .      using _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ imaging of the bright central regions a , c , and e of m82 , oconnell et al .",
    "( 1995 ) resolved these into a swarm of over 100 young star cluster candidates , with a mean @xmath24 , brighter than any globular cluster in the local group .",
    "satyapal et al .  (",
    "1997 ) found evidence in the near - ir of a dozen compact clusters lying deeper within the heavily obscured core of the galaxy near a , c , and e. the core clusters show an age dispersion of 6 myr and indications of outward propagation of star formation .",
    "gallagher & smith ( 1999 ) determined a significantly older age of 60 myr for the luminous cluster f , which is located 440 pc south - west of the nucleus .",
    "such `` super '' star clusters ( sscs ) have been discovered , mostly with _",
    "hst _ , in other interacting , amorphous , dwarf , and starburst galaxies ( e.g.  arp & sandage 1985 , melnick , moles , & terlevich 1985 , meurer et al .",

    "1994 , 2000 , oconnell , gallagher , & hunter 1994 , ho & filippenko 1996b , conti , leitherer , & vacca 1996 , ho 1997 , watson et al .",
    "1996 , carlson et al .",
    "their diameters , luminosities , and  in several cases  masses are consistent with these being young _ globular _ clusters formed as a result of recent gas flows ( e.g.  van den bergh 1995 , meurer 1995 , ho & filippenko 1996a , hunter et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the case of m82 f ,",
    "smith & gallagher ( 2000 ) obtained a dynamical mass of @xmath25 .",
    "it is possible that a large fraction of the star formation in starbursts takes place in the form of such concentrated clusters .",
    "the discovery that globular cluster formation , once thought to occur only during early stages of galaxy evolution , continues today is one of _ hst _ s main contributions to astrophysics to date .",
    "m82 is one of the few galaxies containing a rich , starburst - induced cluster system which is near enough that the internal structure of individual sscs can be studied .",
    "most cluster systems are too distant for such work , even with _",
    "hst_. apart from their intrinsic interest , sscs can be individually age - dated and are therefore important tracers of the history of the starburst process across the face of a galaxy like m82 .",
    "if region b is indeed a fossil starburst site , it probably contains evolved clusters which originally had properties similar to those now observed in region a. the presence of both the active and the fossil starburst sites in m82 therefore provides a unique arena for the study of the stellar and dynamical evolution of star cluster systems . even in the time interval of 0.31 gyr that has probably elapsed since the starburst in region b , evolutionary effects might be detectable because of the dense environment of the starburst . in order to explore the fossil starburst site and to detect candidate sscs , we therefore made new , multiband optical / near - ir observations of region b with",

    "the cluster luminosity functions and estimated masses are discussed in   8 and 9 , respectively . in ",
    "10 we present a detailed analysis of the cluster profiles .",
    "finally , in  11 we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "we observed m82 b on september 15 , 1997 , with both the _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) _ and the _ near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) _ on board the _ hst _ ( program i d 7446 ) .",
    "we imaged two adjacent 35  square fields , `` b1 '' and `` b2 '' with the planetary camera ( pc ) chip ( 00455 pix@xmath10 ) of the _ wfpc2_. field centers ( j2000 ) of the pc were ra = @xmath26 , dec = @xmath2705 for b1 and ra = @xmath28 , dec = @xmath2935 for b2 .",
    "we used the f439w , f555w and f814w passbands , with total integration times of 4400s , 2500s and 2200s , respectively , for region b1 and 4100s , 3100s and 2200s , respectively , for region b2 .",
    "the field of view during the observations was rotated clockwise by , respectively , 19.09@xmath30 and 20.55@xmath30 from the north - south axis .",
    "these observations were obtained with four exposures per filter , using two exposure times , to facilitate the removal of cosmic ray events and increase dynamic range .",
    "the _ wfpc2 _",
    "f439w , f555w and f814w filters are roughly comparable to the johnson - cousins broad - band _ b , v _ and _ i _ filters , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ ground.fig ] we have overlaid the contours of our two _ wfpc2 _ fields on a _ b_-band image , extracted from a palomar 5 m plate taken by sandage ( exposure time 20 minutes , seeing @xmath31 ; cf.oconnell et al .",
    "the pc ccd chip is the square `` step '' in the overall l - shaped footprint of the _ wfpc2_. the contours are labeled by the part of region b which is centered on the pc .",
    "`` b1 '' is an irregular , high surface brightness region lying along the major axis of the galaxy about 55  ( 960 pc ) ne of the brightest optical region , a. [ for the distance of m82 , we adopt 3.6 mpc , or @xmath32 mag , based on the cepheid distance for m81 obtained by freedman et al.(1994 ) ; see also sakai & madore ( 1999 ) .",
    "the corresponding linear scale is 17.5 pc per arcsec . ]",
    "region b2 is halfway between b1 and a and is therefore closer to the nuclear starburst .",
    "it has lower _ b_-band surface brightness than b1 and is more enveloped in complex dust lanes .",
    "the conspicuous central dust lane which bisects the galaxy marks the western edge of b2 .    in the near - ir we chose to use _ nicmos _ camera-2 ( 0075 pix@xmath10 ) as the best compromise of resolution and field of view . for both b1 and b2 , we acquired 4 partially overlapping exposures in both the f110w and f160w filters ( comparable to the bessell _ j _ and _ h _ filters , respectively ) , in a tiled pattern .",
    "the integrations , with effective integration times of 768s for each field and filter , were taken in multiaccum mode to preserve dynamic range and to correct for cosmic rays .",
    "sky background exposures were not necessary because of the brightness of the sources .",
    "pipeline image reduction and calibration was done with standard procedures by the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) , using the updated and corrected on - orbit flat fields most appropriate for our observations .    since our _ wfpc2 _ images with a common pointing were aligned to within a few hundredths of a pixel , we simply co - added the individual observations in a given filter using the iraf / stsdas task crrej .",
    "this task also removed cosmic ray events in a series of iterations that allow correction for cosmic ray hits in pixels adjacent to those that already have been corrected in an earlier iteration .",
    "after some experimenting , we found that as few as 23 iterations produce output images in which the remaining cosmic ray hits  if any  are indistinguishable from poisson noise in the relatively bright background levels of our images .    due to the smaller field of view of _ nicmos _ camera-2",
    ", we had to mosaic the four tiled exposures at each position to cover an area comparable to the pc field .",
    "the mosaicing was done using objects in common on the frames for the determination of the exact spatial offsets .",
    "the flux histogram in the overlapping area was used to determine the necessary adjustment of background levels ( see de grijs 1997 , 1998 ) .    the rebinning ( under conservation of the observed flux ) and rotation of the _ nicmos _ images to the _ wfpc2 _ pixel size and orientation , and the alignment of the optical and near - ir images were performed using the standard iraf tasks magnify , rotate , and imalign .",
    "we determined the rotation angles and alignment offsets using objects in common on optical and near - ir images .",
    "the final , aligned images were trimmed to a standard size ( @xmath33 pixels , or 34@xmath3499 ) to facilitate object detection in a common reference frame .",
    "we used the transformation coefficients of holtzman et al .",

    "the colors of the cluster candidates in m82 b fall within the range for which this calibration is applicable .",
    "we estimated foreground extinction by our galaxy from burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) , who give @xmath49 mag for m82 .",

    "small - scale variability in the bright m82 background is a serious problem for our resolved - source photometry ( see  [ background.sect ] and table [ background.tab ] ) . to assess its impact",
    ", we tested our reduction and calibration procedures on synthetic data fields in two different ways .    *",
    "( i ) * first , we created artificial star fields by randomly and uniformly adding 500 gaussian star profiles to empty frames of the same size as our science observations ( with zero background ) .",
    "we required that the centers of the artificial sources should be at least 6 pixels ( 0273 ) from the edges of the frames .",
    "the fwhms of the synthetic point sources were obtained from observational psfs in the _",
    "wfpc2 _ psf library , with fwhm@xmath63 pixels or 0066 , fwhm@xmath64 pixels or 0072 , and they were scaled to the desired magnitudes .",
    "the histogram of input magnitudes was chosen to approximate a power - law distribution , similar to those of the luminosity functions in the m82 b regions , and extending to well below the 50% completeness limits (  [ compl.sect ] ) . to simulate the observational situation as closely as possible , we added poisson noise to the point sources .",
    "we then added these control fields to the observed m82 data frames to produce synthetic data frames to use as tests of our photometric accuracy and completeness .    *",
    "( ii ) * in  [ starclussep : sect ] we use image sizes to discriminate stars from clusters .",
    "so that we could test our technique on stellar images which were as realistic as possible , we created another set of synthetic images based on real _ hst _ observations in the f555w passband of an uncrowded star field in the globular cluster @xmath62 centauri obtained by dcruz et al .",
    "we combined the pc exposures of their `` position 2 '' ( j2000 : ra = @xmath65 , dec = @xmath6638 ) into a single median - filtered f555w image .",
    "sky background is near zero on this image .",

    "[ errors.fig ] we show the error curves resulting from measuring the brightnesses of the artificial sources in our type-(i ) control field in the same fashion as those of the real sources discussed in  [ sources.sect ] . as a function of input source magnitude",
    "we have plotted the ( @xmath67 ) standard deviations of the distribution of the differences between the input and retrieved magnitudes , for all passbands and both regions .",
    "the resulting error estimates ( e.g.@xmath68 mag at @xmath69 ) are significantly higher than would be the case for isolated point sources on a clean sky background .",

    "a dust lane bisects region b1 .",
    "the photometry and spectra of region b discussed by om and marcum & oconnell ( 1996 ) were based on observations of the easternmost part of b1 ( the upper left lobe in fig .",

    "there are bright resolved or semi - resolved structures in all bands , though fewer are present at short wavelengths .",
    "the brighter of these appear to be sscs .",

    "the myriad of faint point sources detectable in the _ i _ band but more easily visible on the _ j _ and _ h _ frames are luminous , cool giants , resolved for the first time in the main body of the galaxy on these exposures (  [ stars.sect ] ) . the red giant branch tip was first detected in the halo of m82 on _ hst _ _ v _ and _ i _ exposures at @xmath70 by sakai and madore ( 1999 ) .",
    "to determine the background surface brightness level in regions b1 and b2 , we sampled fluxes in 500 randomly placed 10-pixel radius apertures in each field and filter .",
    "results are summarized in table [ background.tab ] .",
    "the modal background surface brightnesses and dispersions are derived from gaussian fits to the resulting flux histograms .",
    "the _ b_-band value for region b1 is significantly fainter than that quoted in  [ calib.sect ] because the @xmath16 apertures used there were centered on the brightest subregion within the b1 field .",

    "in fact , they are similar to the bulge core brightnesses of normal galaxies . as argued in",
    " [ intro1.sect ] , this is evidence for unusually intense star formation in the past , extending up to a radius of 1 kpc , well beyond the confines of the active present - day starburst .",
    "m82 would be regarded as a very unusual galaxy even in the absence of its emission line plume and the radio / ir indicators of activity because of the strange , high surface brightness optical structures found in its central disk .",
    "we based our initial selection of source candidates on a modified version of the daofind task in the daophot software package ( stetson 1987 ) , running under idl .",
    "experiments revealed a large disparity in candidate lists based on the different wavelength bands , as might be expected from the appearance of figs .",
    "[ b1.fig][b2bvsnir.fig ] .",
    "candidates identified in the near - ir images are often too faint for meaningful measurements in the _ b _ or _ v _ bands and vice - versa .    therefore , we decided to combine and cross - correlate source lists obtained in individual passbands and to supplement the automated identifications with visual inspections .",
    "we performed extensive checks to find the best selection criteria and thus to minimize the effects of dust features , residual cosmic rays , poisson noise in regions of high surface brightness , and the ccd edges .",
    "we chose our detection thresholds such that the numbers of initial candidates selected from each passband were comparable .",
    "next , we cross - correlated the source lists obtained in the individual passbands , allowing for only a 1-pixel positional mismatch between the individual optical or near - ir bands ; we allowed for a 2-pixel mismatch when cross - correlating optical / near - ir source positions , since the _ nicmos _ and _ wfpc2 _ optical paths are slightly different .",
    "this procedure led us to conclude that the cross - correlation of the identifications in the f555w and f814w filters ( _ v _ and _ i _ ) contains the most representative fraction of the population of genuine sources in m82 b.    to reject artifacts remaining in the cross - correlated @xmath72 list and real sources which were badly situated for aperture photometry , we visually examined all the candidates on enlargements of the f555w and f814w images .",
    "we discovered that many of the listed candidates were artifacts and , moreover , that a number of plausible candidates had not been included by the automated algorithms because of complicated structures , extended profiles , or a highly non - uniform background .",
    "there were 268 and 147 sources in the b1 and b2 fields , respectively , that were missed by the automated detection routine in f555w and f814w .",
    "we added these to the lists .",
    "the complete source lists thus obtained contain 735 and 640 candidates in m82 b1 and b2 , respectively .",
    "several systematic biases are inevitably introduced by the source selection procedure",
    ". very blue or very red objects could be excluded because of the primary @xmath72 selection . from the standpoint of age - dating the star forming activity in region b , the blue omissions are probably more important .",
    "visual inspection of the _ b_-band frames indicated that a number of the obvious sources brighter than @xmath73 mag were missed .",
    "we added these sources to the lists , 40 and 25 , respectively , in b1 and b2 .",
    "in addition , most of the swarm of faint pointlike sources present in the f110w and f160w frames are not detected in _",
    "v _ either and therefore are not included in our final source list .",
    "although most of these fainter near - ir sources appear to be cool stars ( we comment on them separately in  [ stars.sect ] ) , we added the 58 and 94 brightest near - ir sources that were missed by our automated detection routine to the source lists for b1 and b2 , respectively .",
    "extinction is obviously a limiting factor in our ability to sample the resolved sources in region b. by basing our selection on _ v _ and _ i _ , we are probably biased toward the surface regions of m82 b. however , we are confident that we have been able to detect nearly all of the cluster candidates in the brightest 34 magnitudes of the luminosity function in _ any _ of the observed passbands .",

    "even though mathematically convenient , a gaussian profile may not be the best representation of the radial luminosity profiles of star clusters , since they may have more extended wings than gaussian distributions , thus causing an underestimate the true half - light radii ( see also holtzman et al .",

    "given their sizes and ages , which amount to many dynamical crossing times ( of typically a few myr ; cf .",
    "schweizer et al . 1996 ) for their estimated masses , the m82 clusters are predominantly gravitationally bound .    alternatively , one can fit more complex models that are better representations of the true stellar light distribution in compact clusters .",
    "the most general of these is the mathematically convenient function of surface brightness @xmath154 as a function of radius _ r _ , proposed by elson , fall , & freeman ( 1987 ) : @xmath155 equation ( [ elson.eq ] ) reduces to a modified hubble law for @xmath156 , which is a good approximation to the canonical king model for globular clusters ( king 1966 ) .",

    "most of these clusters do not seem to be tidally truncated , although cluster radial profiles are often modeled as truncated modified hubble laws , with the truncation occurring at @xmath20 101000 @xmath86 ( e.g.  holtzman et al.1996 , watson et al .",
    "1996 ) .    due to low signal - to - noise ratios , complicated galactic backgrounds , and the distance to most ssc systems , the fitting to determine the core radii of sscs has proven difficult .",
    "previous studies have only been able to place upper limits on the core radii ( holtzman et al .",
    "1996 [ ngc 3597 : @xmath159 pc ] , carlson et al .",
    "1998 [ ngc 1275 : @xmath160 pc ] ) .",
    "we fit modified hubble profiles ( @xmath161 ) to the radial luminosity distributions within the inner 3 pixels ( 2.4 pc ) of the m82 b cluster sample with @xmath152 pixels , using a customized version of the curvefit subroutine running under idl .",
    "it employs a gradient - expansion algorithm to compute a non - linear least squares fit to a modified hubble profile .",
    "we find core radii of @xmath162 pixels , or @xmath6 pc , with a smaller , secondary peak at @xmath163 pc .",
    "these core radii are similar to those for the galactic globular clusters ( djorgovski 1993 ) : @xmath164 pc , with a total range from 0.03 to 23.4 pc .    in fig .",
    "[ bright.fig ] we present the _",
    "v_-band light profiles of the five brightest star cluster candidates in each field .",
    "their photometric characteristics and the size estimates obtained from fits to the innermost 8 pixels are summarized in table [ bright.tab ] .",
    "these objects are bright and relatively isolated , thus enabling us to follow the light profiles further out .",
    "the modified hubble profile fits are generally better than the gaussian fits .",
    "the second and fourth columns of fig .  [ bright.fig ] show the flux ratio of the data points to both the gaussian and the modified hubble profile approximations . for reasons of clarity we did not include the equivalent ratio for the @xmath158 profile in the figure .",
    "however , the residuals for the @xmath158 profiles are similar to or slightly better than the @xmath165 fits .",
    "to assess the robustness of our fitting procedures , we obtained independent model fitting results based on the two - dimensional profile fitting routines of matthews et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which take into account the detailed _ hst _ psfs at the positions of our m82 b clusters .",
    "matthews kindly provided us with detailed profile fits for the brightest clusters in each of our fields , and for each of the functionalities assumed in this paper .",
    "the difference between her and our results is @xmath166% , and does not appear to be systematic .",
    "some of the star clusters in fig .",
    "[ bright.fig ] show evidence for asymmetrical structures , elongations or subclustering , which may mean that they have not yet reached dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we may be witnessing ongoing merging processes , although we will need spectroscopic follow - up observations to unambiguously determine this .",
    "similar subclustering has been observed in the sscs in ngc 1569 ( oconnell et al .",
    "1994 , de marchi et al .",
    "1997 ) and in some of the rich lmc star clusters ( e.g.  fischer , welch , & mateo 1993 ) .",
    "we have presented high - resolution _",
    "hst wfpc2 _ and _ nicmos _ imaging of two adjacent fields in the disk 1 kpc ne of the center of m82 , the prototype local starburst galaxy .",
    "this region , m82 `` b , '' has been suspected to be a site where an intense episode of star formation occurred over 100 myr ago .",
    "our new observations confirm that m82 b is a `` fossil '' of an ancient starburst with an amplitude entirely comparable to that now transpiring in the core of m82 .",
    "it is an analog of the anomalous e@xmath167a systems found in distant galaxy clusters .",
    "m82 thus presents us with the unique opportunity to observe both active and evolved starburst environments at close range .      *",
    "the surface brightness of m82 b is well above normal for galactic disks and comparable to the core surface brightnesses in spiral galaxies .",
    "its intrinsic surface brightness at an age of 10 myr was comparable to that found in the present - day nuclear starburst , indicating an event of comparable amplitude . * because of the bright unresolved background light and the large and highly variable extinction within m82 , we have been forced to use specialized methods to identify and photometer sources .",
    "we tested selection and photometry methods using artificial sources or real star field images from _ hst _ injected into our observed images .",
    "the proximity of m82 , however , is a key advantage relative to studies of more distant galaxies systems because we can use source sizes as a criterion to distinguish stars from star clusters .",
    "* we find a large , evolved system of sscs in m82 b. our cluster candidate samples consist of well - defined sources with gaussian @xmath88 pixels ( 00569 , or 1.0 pc ) , @xmath90 mag , and relatively smooth backgrounds .",
    "these samples contain 43 and 70 cluster candidates in regions b1 and b2 ( nearest the m82 nucleus ) , respectively .",
    "* we use a two - color _ bvi _ diagram and evolutionary spectral synthesis models to separately estimate the extinction and age of each cluster .",
    "the clusters range in absolute magnitude from @xmath0 to 10 , with a peak at 7.5 .",
    "the derived age distribution suggests steady , continuing cluster formation at a modest rate at early times ( @xmath168 gyr ago ) , followed by a concentrated formation episode @xmath2 myr ago and more recent suppression of cluster formation .",
    "the peak episode coincides with independent dynamical estimates for the last tidal encounter with m81 , which presumably induced the starburst . *",
    "our _ j _ and _ h _ band observations resolve the stellar population in m82 s disk for the first time . comparing our near - ir color - magnitude diagram to recent padova isochrones ,",
    "the detected stars appear to be cool , helium - burning bright giants .",
    "star formation evidently continued in m82 b until about 20  30 myr ago .",
    "however , significant star formation has not occurred in m82 b in the last 1015 myr , during which the nuclear starburst has been highly active . * after correcting the cluster luminosity function to a fiducial age of 50 myr , we find that the bright end is characterized by a power - law slope with @xmath4 , similar to that of other young cluster systems in interacting galaxies",
    ". there is tentative evidence for broadening of the luminosity function due to dynamical destruction of lower mass clusters . *",
    "the radial luminosity profiles of the brightest clusters are more closely approximated by modified hubble or `` elson '' functions with @xmath169 2.0 or 2.6 than by gaussians .",
    "some of the clusters show evidence for asymmetries or subclustering , possibly an indication of mergers .",
    "cluster sizes ( @xmath5 pc , or @xmath170 pc ) and estimated masses ( a median of @xmath7 ) are consistent with values found for young super star cluster populations in m82 s core and other galaxies and with the progenitors of globular clusters .",
    "when we combine the age estimates for the evolved cluster sample in m82 b , for the integrated spectrum of m82 b ( marcum & oconnell 1996 ) , and for the resolved cool giants in the disk of region b , the following picture for the star formation history in its disk emerges .",
    "the last tidal encounter between m82 and m81 about 500 myr ago had a major impact on what was probably an otherwise normal , quiescent , disk galaxy .",
    "it caused a concentrated burst of star formation activity , as evidenced by the peak in the age distribution of the cluster sample in m82 b. comparison of the cluster ages with the integrated light dating ( @xmath171200 myr ) suggests that field star formation may have continued at a high rate after cluster formation had begun to decline , but the uncertainties in the methods are too large to be certain .",
    "the enhanced cluster formation decreased rapidly within a few hundred myr of its peak . however , field star formation continued , probably at a much lower rate , in m82 b until @xmath172 myr ago .",
    "it has evidently been suppressed during the last @xmath173 myr , during which the starburst in the core of m82 has been most active .",
    "evidence for supernova remnants in the parts of region b2 nearest the starburst core ( de grijs et al .",
    "2000 ) but not in region b1 indicates that disk star formation during the last 50 myr was more active nearer the nucleus .",
    "the current starburst is probably related to late infall of tidally disrupted debris from m82 itself .",
    "the evidence for decoupling between cluster and field star formation is consistent with the view that ssc formation requires special conditions , e.g. large scale gas flows , in addition to the presence of dense gas ( cf . ashman & zepf 1992 , elmegreen & efremov 1997 ) .",
    "a strong tidal interaction could easily produce an off - nuclear starburst at a site like m82 b. however , the m82 b burst could also have been part of a larger scale event encompassing the center of the galaxy as well . given the high extinction and the dominance by much younger concentrations of stars , it would not be easy to identify older clusters in the starburst core if they exist .",
    "all of our observational evidence points to a scenario in which the intermediate - age star cluster population in m82 b is entirely comparable to ssc populations at a younger age , as seen in m82 a and other galaxies .",
    "they will likely evolve into galactic globular cluster analogs over a hubble time .",

    "<S> we present high - resolution _ hst _ imaging in the optical ( _ wfpc2 _ ) and near - infrared ( _ nicmos _ ) of a disk region 1 kpc ne of the starburst core in the nearby galaxy m82 . </S>",
    "<S> this region , m82 `` b , '' has been suspected to be a fossil starburst site in which an intense episode of star formation occurred over 100 myr ago , and our new observations confirm this intepretation . </S>",
    "<S> m82 thus presents us with the opportunity to observe both active and evolved starburst environments at close range .    </S>",
    "<S> the surface brightness of m82 b is well above normal for galactic disks and comparable to the core surface brightnesses in spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> its intrinsic surface brightness at an age of 10 myr was comparable to that found in the present - day nuclear starburst , indicating an event of comparable amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> we find a large , evolved system of super star clusters in m82 b. using size as a criterion to distinguish cluster candidates from point sources , we identify a total of 113 super star cluster candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we use a two - color _ bvi _ diagram and evolutionary spectral synthesis models to separately estimate the extinction and age of each cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters range in absolute magnitude from @xmath0 to 10 , with a peak at 7.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the derived age distribution suggests steady , continuing cluster formation at a modest rate at early times ( @xmath1 gyr ago ) , followed by a concentrated formation episode @xmath2 myr ago and more recent suppression of cluster formation . </S>",
    "<S> the peak episode coincides with independent dynamical estimates for the last tidal encounter with m81 , which presumably induced the starburst .    </S>",
    "<S> our _ j _ and _ h _ band observations resolve the bright giant population in m82 s disk for the first time </S>",
    "<S> . star formation evidently continued in m82 b until about 20  30 myr ago , but none is found associated with the youngest generations in the nuclear starburst ( age @xmath3 myr ) .    </S>",
    "<S> after correcting the cluster luminosity function to a fiducial age of 50 myr , we find that the bright end is characterized by a power - law slope with @xmath4 , similar to that of other young cluster systems in interacting galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> there is tentative evidence for broadening of the luminosity function due to dynamical destruction of lower mass clusters . </S>",
    "<S> cluster sizes ( @xmath5 pc , or @xmath6 pc ) and estimated masses ( a median of @xmath7 ) are consistent with values found for young super star cluster populations in m82 s core and other galaxies and with the progenitors of globular clusters . </S>"
