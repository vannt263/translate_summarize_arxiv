    "kaon production on a nucleon or a nucleus by the electromagnetic interaction provides invaluable information on the strangeness production mechanism , since the electromagnetic interaction is better understood than the hadronic interaction .",
    "studies using real photon and electron beams were started in the early 1950s .",
    "the @xmath3 reaction was studied from the threshold up to 1.4 gev by measuring the differential cross sections @xcite , total cross sections @xcite and @xmath4 polarizations @xcite .",
    "an experiment using the polarized target was also made @xcite .",
    "the isobar model for kaon photoproduction was developed to reproduce the experimental results in the 1960s @xcite .    since the 1990s ,",
    "new experiments have been carried out using advanced detector systems at accelerator facilities which provide higher - quality photon or electron beams .",
    "there are six isospin channels of elementary kaon photoproduction , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , though kaon production reactions with proton targets have mainly been investigated to date .",
    "the @xmath3 reaction has been studied from the threshold region up to a photon energy of 2.95 gev by measuring the differential and total cross sections at elsa / saphir @xcite , jlab / clas @xcite and spring-8/leps @xcite .",
    "polarization transfer in the @xmath10 reaction has been also measured at clas @xcite , and the beam polarization asymmetries for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 reactions have been measured at spring-8/leps @xcite . to date , several theoretical models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "although a wide variety of observables in elementary kaon photoproduction processes has been investigated , no model has successfully explained them all .",
    "therefore , further experimental and theoretical studies are eagerly awaited , particularly in other isospin channels . in particular ,",
    "the @xmath7 reaction is expected to greatly help clarify the strangeness photoproduction process .",
    "this reaction has the following features :    1 .",
    "the born term in the t - channel does not contribute , in contrast to reactions with @xmath13 in the final state , because no charge is involved in the reaction .",
    "the coupling constants in the u - channel for @xmath14 and other isovector exchanges have the same value but are of opposite sign to those in the @xmath3 reaction due to the isospin symmetry .",
    "because of these characteristics , the interference among the diagrams in the @xmath15 production process is quite different from that in the @xmath16 process . due to this differences , it was indicated that the angular distribution of the @xmath15 production process shows a backward peak @xcite .",
    "therefore , comparison of @xmath1 and @xmath13 photoproduction data , especially the angular distribution , is very important for the investigation of the strangeness photoproduction mechanism .",
    "note , that the absence of electric charge in the @xmath15 process ( the s - channel born term is gauge - invariant by itself ) makes implementation of hadronic form factors easier than in the @xmath16 case .",
    "besides the features mentioned above , the influence of the higher mass resonances can be considered to be small in the present experiment , which was carried out near the threshold , @xmath01.1 gev .",
    "prior to the present experiment , the photoproduction of neutral kaons on a carbon target near the threshold energy was measured for the first time at the laboratory of nuclear science ( lns ) of tohoku university @xcite .",
    "neutral kaons were detected via the @xmath17 decay channel using the neutral kaon spectrometer ( nks ) .",
    "the cross sections were compared with those for @xmath13 photoproduction @xcite as a function of the incident photon energy .",
    "it was found that the cross sections for @xmath1 and @xmath13 production on @xmath18c are almost of the same magnitude .",
    "the momentum spectra of kaons were also compared with simple model calculations based on recent isobar models for elementary production processes .",

    "similar to that of sla , gives a very good agreement with the present data in both photon - energy regions . on the other hand , ph2 , giving a momentum spectrum similar to that of kaon - maid and a forward peaked angular distribution in contrast to ph1 , clearly contradicts the present result .",
    "thus , a comparison of the data and predictions of models favors an angular distribution of the @xmath7 reaction in the c.m .",

    "[ fig : eleme ] , the photon energy dependence of the total cross section for @xmath15 photoproduction is given for sla with @xmath98 , kaon - maid and the ph1 and ph2 parameterizations .",
    "the @xmath1 total cross sections are not obtained in the present experiment due to the limited kinematical acceptance for @xmath1 .",
    "kaon - maid predicts a very sharp rise in the photon - energy dependence of the @xmath1 total cross section near the threshold ( @xmath106 gev ) , while sla , as well as ph1 and ph2 , gives a flatter energy dependence and much smaller cross section in the threshold region .",
    "@xmath1 photoproduction on a deuterium target was studied in the threshold region for the first time .",
    "the experiment was conducted at lns of tohoku university following the measurement of quasi - free photoproduction of @xmath1 on a carbon target .",
    "inclusive momentum distributions were obtained and compared with theoretical calculations .",
    "the calculations were performed in the plane wave impulse approximation using a realistic bonn wave function obepq for a deuteron , firstly with the recent isobar models , kaon - maid and saclay - lyon a , and secondly with simple phenomenological parameterization .",
    "based on the comparison , the angular distributions of the elementary cross sections were examined .",
    "the best agreement with the data was achieved with the sla model , in which the ratio of the neutral - to - charged electromagnetic coupling constants for the @xmath81 meson was obtained to be @xmath97 = @xmath1072.09 by fitting data in the photon energy region , @xmath1081.0 gev , and with phenomenological parametrization fitted in the photon energy region , @xmath1081.0 gev .",
