    "one of the best known relations of topology in solid state systems is the explanation of the quantized hall effect , which was first discovered by von klitzing et al .",
    "@xcite , in terms of a topological invariant @xcite .",
    "today topological many - body systems are a strongly investigated and well understood subject @xcite , and in recent works a topological periodic table has been proposed  @xcite to relate topological systems depending on their symmetries , e.g. , electron - particle hole symmetry or time - reversal symmetry , to different classes .",
    "two simple and one - dimensional topological systems are the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite , initially introduced to investigate the one - dimensional polyacetylene , and the kitaev @xcite chain , a model for the description of a one - dimensional spinless superconductor .",
    "they possess an energy spectrum exhibiting a band gap .",
    "in dependence of a certain parameter two different topological phases can arise , which can be distinguished by energies lying within the band gap .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates of the gap - connecting energies are called edge states .",
    "these edge states show a strong localization at the edge of the system and can only exist in the topologically nontrivial phase ( tnp ) . besides the tnp the two one - dimensional systems feature a topologically trivial phase ( ttp ) , which is characterized by a fully gapped energy spectrum , in which consequently no edge states appear .    in reality",
    "any topological system will always interact with its nearby environment , which leads to dissipative effects .",
    "a common way to handle such environment effects in many - body systems is the solution of the dynamics via lindblad master equations @xcite .",
    "however , this can become numerically very expensive , and in many cases an effective description in terms of the stationary schrdinger equation is sufficient .",
    "an often used and elegant way of describing interactions with an environment on the stationary level is given by the application of non - hermitian potentials @xcite .",
    "examples range from electromagnetic waves @xcite , dissipative electric circuits @xcite and optomechanics @xcite to quantum mechanics , where it is applied in atomic @xcite or molecular @xcite physics , the scattering of particles @xcite , the explanation of fundamental relations @xcite , and in many - body systems @xcite .    a special class of non - hermitian operators , viz .",
    "those possessing a parity - time symmetry , has been introduced by bender and boettcher in 1998 @xcite because these operators feature the interesting property that they can posses purely real eigenvalues despite their non - hermiticity .",
    "however , in general the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric operators can be complex .",
    "a hamiltonian is considered to be @xmath0 symmetric if it commutes with the combined action of the parity operator @xmath2 and the time - reversal operator @xmath3 , i.e.  @xmath4=0 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry of the system can become spontaneously broken , and this symmetry breaking is related to the realness of the eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath0-symmetric eigenstates of a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian always possess purely real eigenvalues , while eigenstates that are not @xmath0 symmetric appear in pairs with complex and complex conjugate eigenvalues .",
    "it turned out that @xmath0 symmetry is a powerful concept to effectively describe systems interacting with an environment in such a way that they experience balanced gain and loss .",
    "in particular , it was shown in optical experiments that @xmath0 symmetry and @xmath0-symmetry breaking can be realized in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "proposals for the realization in quantum mechanics exist for bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "recently some models of topological insulators have been investigated under gain and loss effects in terms of non - hermitian operators .",
    "this leads to new questions .",
    "in particular , it has to be understood whether topologically protected states can be found in presence of the gain and loss @xcite .",
    "zhu et al .",
    "@xcite and wang et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the connection between the tnp and spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking due to external gain and loss in two different systems , viz .",
    "the ssh and kitaev models , respectively . comparing the results of the two investigations leads to a discrepancy in the interplay between topological phases and spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking . in the kitaev chain",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is protected within the tnp when a non - hermitian potential is applied .",
    "on the other hand the ssh model shows an instantaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking within the tnp for every arbitrarily small gain and loss effect .",
    "also in further models it was sometimes found that completely real eigenspectra do not appear in the tnp , whereas this was possible in other models .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to give an unambiguous answer to the question of how the relation between topologically nontrivial edge states and the effects of @xmath0-symmetry breaking can be established .",
    "to do so , we investigate the ssh and kitaev models in the presence of two different non - hermitian potentials generating @xmath0-symmetric gain - loss effects . in particular we study the eigenstates of the system and the symmetries of the edge states .",
    "it will turn out that there is no general relation between the @xmath0 symmetry of the system and the topological phase as assumed previously @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the specific edge states in the systems decides whether or not these states spontaneously break the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the symmetry the states exhibit in the hermitian case survives in the presence of the gain - loss effect .",
    "however , in dependence of the imaginary potential applied to the system also the bulk states may lead to a spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking in both the tnp and the ttp .",

    "[ sec : models ] the two different hamiltonians are introduced . in sec.[sec : results_and_discussions ] energy spectra of the two models are shown without and with the application of external gain and loss potentials .",

    "the second system is the one - dimensional kitaev chain  @xcite , which is a toy model for a topological @xmath13-wave superconductor , @xmath14 where the chemical potential is given by @xmath15 , @xmath9 is again the nearest neighbor hopping and @xmath16 is the @xmath13-wave pairing amplitude . in both models",
    "the operator @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons at lattice site @xmath19 .    in our study",

    "we distinguish between two potentials , @xmath25 in which electrons gain in probability amplitude at the first site and lose at the last site .",
    "the second @xmath0-symmetric potential , @xmath26 corresponds to an alternating gain and loss effect of the whole chain .    due to the superconducting term in the kitaev hamiltonian",
    "a coupling between electrons and holes arises .",
    "the basis of the kitaev chain has to be expanded to respect the particle - hole coupling .",
    "the particle number operator of an electron at site @xmath27 is given by the relation @xmath28 , whereas the number operator for holes reads @xmath29 .",

    "s convenience we briefly recapitulate the essential properties of both models . in the case of the isolated models , i.e. , @xmath41 , both energy spectra show domains , in which a vanishing energy emerges .",
    "the presence of a zero - energy is connected to edge states .",

    "as one can see the edge state of the kitaev model fulfills particle - hole symmetry , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "even though no potential is applied the @xmath0 symmetry of the edge states shown can be explored . in the ssh model the @xmath0 symmetry is broken by the edge states , whereas the edge states of the kitaev model conserve the @xmath0 symmetry . though every single expectation value @xmath55 , respectively @xmath56 , of the kitaev edge state is not @xmath0 symmetric , it is the particle - hole symmetry , which ensures the @xmath0 symmetry of the edge state . due to",
    "the anticommutation relation of fermions @xmath57 a gain @xmath1 of an electron at site @xmath27 corresponds to the equal loss of a hole at the same lattice site . applying a",
    "@xmath0-symmetric potential generates gain and loss effects to specific lattice sites in the kitaev chain depending on the potential @xmath36 , respectively @xmath37 . for one lattice site",
    "the net gain - loss effect is zero if a particle - hole symmetry in the occupation probabilities is present .",
    "if an eigenstate preserves particle - hole symmetry throughout the whole system , the net gain is zero and therefore the corresponding eigenstate accomplishes @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the crucial question now is whether this symmetry survives in the case that imaginary potentials are indeed applied .      for small gain and loss strengths",
    "@xmath1 the spectra of the energy real parts do not change much under variation of the imaginary potential as compared to the isolated cases .",
    "moreover the parameter regimes of the tnp stay the same in the kitaev model as well as in the ssh model , and therefore also edge states are available in the case of small imaginary potential strengths .",
    "the calculation of the edge state expectation values generate the same localization as in the isolated case .",
    "thus the total situation does not change and the edge states remain @xmath0 symmetric in the kitaev chain , whereas both edge states of the ssh model are @xmath0-broken eigenstates",
    ".    a purely real energy spectrum can only occur if every eigenstate of the system obeys @xmath0 symmetry . due to the fact that even for any arbitrarily small gain and loss effect at least the two edge states of the ssh model break @xmath0 symmetry the energy spectrum has to show complex energies in the tnp .",
    "this is indeed the case which is illustrated in the first row of figure  [ fig : small - strength ] .",

    "the spectrum performs a @xmath0 phase transition at the same parameter , at which a topological phase transition occurs in the isolated case , i.e. , at @xmath60 .    in the second row of figure",
    "[ fig : small - strength ] the imaginary parts of the energy spectrum for the kitaev chain with applied potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 are shown .",
    "in contrast to the ssh model the potential @xmath36 preserves a purely real spectrum .",
    "both topological phases show the same behavior related to the @xmath0 symmetry , and therefore the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues can not be used to distinguish between the tnp and ttp . for the kitaev model with applied potential @xmath37",
    "the imaginary part of the energy shows a non - vanishing value for disappearing chemical potential @xmath61 .",
    "still the energy spectrum of the imaginary part can not be used to provide any information about the topological phases . taking a closer look at the eigenstates corresponding to the violation of the @xmath0 symmetry for @xmath62",
    "reveals the fact that all states with complex energies are bulk states .",
    "the important finding is that the properties of the edge states in both models are not altered immediately by the presence of the gain - loss effect .",
    "in particular , the symmetries of the edge states survive , which leads to an immediate @xmath0-symmetry breaking in the ssh model by the edge states and a preserved @xmath0 symmetry in the kitaev chain .",
    "this explains that it is the symmetry of the actual edge states that is connected to the @xmath0 symmetry of the whole system not the existence of a topologically nontrivial phase alone .",
    "leaving the field of a low gain and loss effect a @xmath0 phase diagram can be realized by plotting the imaginary parts of the energies over the potential strength @xmath1 . in the case of the ssh model",
    "the phase diagrams for both the potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 are shown in figure  [ fig : ssh - pt - phasediagram ] .",
    "for the dimerization strength @xmath50 , i.e. , in the tnp , the potential @xmath36 only shows one pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues , which vanish for @xmath63 in the ttp .",
    "the same pair also appears if the potential @xmath37 is applied .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates for the two complex eigenvalues appearing in both potentials are the two existing edge states .",
    "in contrast to the potential @xmath36 both of the dimerization strengths shown for @xmath37 possess a critical value , at which the system gets completely @xmath0 broken and therefore not a single energy eigenvalue remains purely real .    for the kitaev chain with applied potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are shown in figure  [ fig : kitaev - pt - phasediagram ]        for two different chemical potentials , where each value represents one of the topological phases in the isolated case , i.e. , @xmath64 for the tnp and @xmath65 for the ttp . for both potentials",
    "there is no obvious difference in the imaginary part of the energies for the different values of @xmath15 . as in the scenario of the ssh model",
    "the potential @xmath37 also exhibits a critical parameter value @xmath1 at which no purely real energy eigenvalue exists . due to the fact that the chemical potential has no appreciable influence on the behavior of the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues the bulk states are responsible for breaking the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the edge states in the kitaev model are particle - hole symmetric and therefore always conserve the @xmath0 symmetry as long as they exist . due to a complete @xmath0-symmetry breaking in the case of the potential @xmath37",
    "the chemical potential capable of hosting edge states is dependent on the potential strength .",
    "since the potential @xmath37 shows a completely @xmath0-broken regime when the gain and loss strength is increased , the chemical potential at which topological edge states can be present has to be a function of the potential strength , i.e. , @xmath66 . for each @xmath15 a critical parameter value @xmath67 can be found at which the topological edge states disappear .",
    "the definition of topological edge states in the sense of the kitaev chain is the fact that the energy has to fulfill the property , @xmath68 i.e. , it has a vanishing real and imaginary part . to obtain a phase diagram a constant gain and loss effect @xmath1 is assumed and for a chemical potential representing the ttp in the isolated model , e.g. , @xmath69 , the energy is calculated .",
    "then the chemical potential is decreased in steps of equal size and for each step the number of eigenvalues fulfilling eq .",
    "is counted .",
    "this is repeated for further values of @xmath1 . in general , numerical calculations",
    "do not supply accurate zero values , and therefore in this work we measure a numerical zero if the modulus is smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "the value selected for zero is in this way not a critical choice because the energy spectra show a pronounced jump to small numbers if any topological edge state is present . in figure",

    "this is in contrast to the kitaev chain in the case that electrons gain in probability at the first site and lose at the last site as described with the potential @xmath36 .",
    "in fact the number of edge states does in the latter case not depend on the value of @xmath1 and is only limited by the chemical potential as in the isolated problem .",
    "the tnp can host two edge states for @xmath74 . in total ,",
    "the kitaev chain is an example , in which gain and loss effects can have an influence on the parameter regime with edge states .",
    "however , the two model potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 show that this behavior of the tnp depends on the shape of the gain and loss effects , and therefore there is no general statement on the existence of edge states in the presence of non - hermitian potentials in the kitaev chain .",
    "in conclusion we studied both the kitaev and the ssh model with two different @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian potentials .",
    "our investigation of the topological interesting edge states explain why the topological nontrivial phase in the ssh model shows an instantaneously @xmath0-broken spectrum for an arbitrary small potential strength @xmath1 , and that the edge states in the case of the kitaev chain are protected from violating @xmath0 symmetry due to an intrinsic particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the important fact is that this symmetry survives in presence of the gain - loss effect . for the kitaev chain",
    "the number of existing edge states at a certain value pair @xmath75 depends on the applied gain and loss effect , and therefore the range of the topological nontrivial phase can be a function of the potential strength @xmath1 .    both results clearly demonstrate that the previously assumed connection between a spontaneously broken @xmath0 symmetry and the topological phase @xcite does not exist in general .",
    "only the symmetry of the individual edge states decides whether their presence has an influence on the @xmath0 symmetry of the whole system .",
    "their existence alone does not give a useful answer .",
    "it is necessary to always determine the states and to investigate their probability distribution .    even though this work can explain the role of the edge states in non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric systems there remain a few open questions .",
    "the imaginary potentials are an effective description of the in- and outfluxes of the probability amplitude and thus for the interaction with an environment . much more realistic",
    "is the addition or removal of electrons , which can be simulated very well in the context of master equations @xcite",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether signatures of the results of this work can be found in the dynamics of the master equation , and investigations in this direction are under way .",
    "furthermore , for non - hermitian operators the often used berry phase @xcite or its formulation in the brillouin zone , i.e.  the zak phase @xcite need extensions to understand the influence of imaginary potential contributions .",
    "some extensions exist @xcite , however , they are restricted to special cases",
    ". a more general way of identifying topologically different states would be valuable . since similar bosonic systems with topologically nontrivial states",
    "are known @xcite and in the case of cold atoms much better controllable in an experiment it seems also worthwhile to extend these studies to bosons .",
    "this might be in particular interesting since bosonic many - body systems already with very simple interactions feature an unusual dynamics such as purity oscillations in the presence of balanced gain and loss @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that the topological interesting states  the edge states  are the reason for the different behaviors of the two models and that the intrinsic particle - hole symmetry of the edge states in the kitaev chain is responsible for a conservation of @xmath0 symmetry in the tnp . </S>"
