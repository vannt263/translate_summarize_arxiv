    "the techniques of @xmath1 quantum mechanics have been used to solve several long - standing problems , such as the violation of unitarity in the lee model @xcite and the appearance of ghosts in the pais - uhlenbeck model @xcite and in other field - theory models @xcite . in this paper",
    "we clarify a serious problem with the double - scaling limit in quantum field theory that in our opinion has not yet been satisfactorily addressed ; namely , that the critical coupling constant @xmath2 is _",
    "negative_. since @xmath3 , the double - scaling limit appears to be unphysical because near @xmath2 the potential is upside - down and the energy appears to be unbounded below .",
    "however , we show that if we approach the critical theory in a @xmath1-symmetric fashion , the resulting correlated limit gives a physically acceptable quantum theory . here , we study the double - scaling limit of a zero - dimensional o(@xmath0)-symmetric quartic vector field - theoretic model .",
    "( in a more detailed paper we will show that the same approach works for theories in higher dimension @xcite . )    to explain the mathematical problem addressed in this paper we consider the partition function @xmath4 for a toy zero - dimensional quartic quantum field theory model : @xmath5 where the coupling constant @xmath6 is assumed at first to be positive .",
    "the weak - coupling series for @xmath4 is obtained by expanding the integrand of ( [ e1 ] ) in powers of @xmath6 and then integrating term by term .",
    "( this is a trivial application of watson s lemma @xcite . )",
    "the result is the ( divergent ) asymptotic - series representation for @xmath4 : @xmath7 this series alternates in sign when @xmath8 and it can be borel summed to recover the integral representation ( [ e1 ] ) .    the integral representation ( [ e1 ] ) for @xmath4 ceases to exist when @xmath6 is negative .",
    "thus , to study the behavior of @xmath4 for negative @xmath6 we evaluate the integral for positive @xmath6 in terms of a parabolic cylinder function @xcite : @xmath9 we conclude from this formula that @xmath4 is a multiple - valued function of @xmath6 ; it is defined on a four - sheeted riemann surface and is complex when @xmath6 is negative .",
    "thus , to evaluate @xmath4 for @xmath10 we must define precisely the path from positive to negative @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain four possible values for @xmath4 depending on how we rotate in the complex-@xmath6 plane from @xmath8 to @xmath10 .    even though @xmath4 is a four - valued function of @xmath6 ,",
    "each term in the asymptotic series ( [ e2 ] ) is single valued .",
    "the resolution of this apparent discrepancy lies in identifying the wedge - shaped region in which a series is asymptotic to the function that it represents ; this region is called a _ stokes wedge_. ( for a detailed discussion of stokes wedges see refs .",
    "the angular opening of the stokes wedge for @xmath11 for @xmath12 is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the complex-@xmath6 plane the stokes wedge is centered about the real-@xmath6 axis and the full opening angle is @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the series ( [ e2 ] ) is asymptotic to @xmath4 in ( [ e3 ] ) on the negative-@xmath6 axes @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we have the paradoxical result that on the negative axes ( [ e2 ] ) is real while @xmath4 is complex .",
    "this happens because the imaginary part of @xmath4 is _ subdominant _ ( exponentially small ) ; it is of order @xmath17 , as can be determined by a saddle - point calculation .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the partition function for negative coupling constant @xcite .",
    "however , we will not be interested in the complex partition function that one obtains by rotating @xmath18 from positive @xmath6 to negative @xmath6 in the complex-@xmath6 plane .",
    "rather , we will keep the coupling constant @xmath6 fixed and perform the @xmath1-symmetric limit of @xmath19 as @xmath20 goes from @xmath21 to @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the resulting partition function is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a comlex contour of integration .",
    "the original integration path lies on the real axis when @xmath25 .",
    "the path rotates downward into the complex plane as @xmath20 increases . when @xmath26 , the final contour @xmath24 comes inward from @xmath27 in the @xmath28 wedge @xmath29 and goes back out to @xmath27 in the @xmath28 wedge @xmath30 . as a consequence ,",

    "correlated limits arise frequently in physical problems when there are two parameters , say @xmath20 and @xmath31 , and @xmath20 is treated as small ( @xmath32 ) so that it plays the role of a perturbation parameter . if we treat @xmath31 as fixed , the solution @xmath33 to the problem is a formal perturbation series in powers of @xmath20 : @xmath34 . usually , the perturbation series is a _ divergent _",

    "one parameter _ , which we call @xmath40 .",
    "in this correlated limit the perturbation series still diverges , but we sum the series for @xmath41 by using borel summation .",
