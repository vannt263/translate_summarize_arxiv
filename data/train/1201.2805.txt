    "in 1951 , p. c. vaidya presented for the first time a metric to describe the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric star , taking into account the radiation flux emitted by the star @xcite . in his work , the mass of the star is no longer considered to be constant and the metric is not static .",
    "the situation is described as a spherical mass surrounded by a finite and nonstatic envelope of radiation with radial symmetry .",
    "this metric has been the usual starting point for the study of the quasinormal modes of time dependent black holes @xcite . the charged version of the metric is also an usual starting point for the study of many aspects of charged black hole physics @xcite .",
    "the vaidya metric has also been used to describe spherically symmetric collapse and the formation of naked singularities @xcite .",
    "it was also applied to the study of hawking radiation and the process of black hole evaporation @xcite , in the stochastic gravity program @xcite , and in recent numerical relativity investigations @xcite .    in the study of quasinormal modes , it is useful to write the vaidya metric in double null coordinates @xcite .",
    "however , there is no general coordinate transformation from the usual radiation coordinates to double null coordinates @xcite .",
    "so our purpose with this paper is to present the most general vaidya metric , @xmath0-dimensional , with cosmological constant @xmath3 and with time dependent mass and electrical charge in these coordinates .",
    "the numerical results are obtained with a generalization of the semi - analytical method used in @xcite , that allows us to construct the structure of the spacetime from the behavior of the outgoing null geodesics .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we present the derivation of the most general vaidya metric in double - null coordinates . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present a discussion on the structure of the spacetime and the numerical results obtained with the semi - analytical method . and",
    "finally in section [ sec4 ] we present our final discussion of the results .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional vaidya metric was first discussed in @xcite",
    ". it can be easily cast in @xmath0-dimensional radiation coordinates @xmath4 as done , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional charged vaidya metric in radiation coordinates , obtained originally in @xcite , reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 stands for the metric of the unit @xmath9-dimensional sphere , assumed here to be spanned by the angular coordinates @xmath10 , ^2_n-2 = _",
    "i=1^n-2(_j=1^i-1 ^2_j ) _ i^2 . for the case of an ingoing radial flow , @xmath11 and @xmath1 is a monotonically increasing mass function in the advanced time @xmath12 , while @xmath13 corresponds to an outgoing radial flow , with @xmath1 being in this case a monotonically decreasing mass function in the retarded time @xmath12 .",
    "the constant @xmath14 corresponds to the total electric charge . in principle",
    ", one can also consider time dependent charges @xmath14 as done , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "this situation will of course require the presence of charged null fluids and currents , whose realistic nature we do not address here .",
    "it has been known since a long time that the radiation coordinates are defective at the horizon @xcite , implying that the vaidya metric ( [ vaidya ] ) , with or without electric charge , is not geodesically complete in any dimension .",
    "the radiation coordinates are not enough to cover the entire vaidya spacetime .",
    "( the radiation coordinates are defective at horizons where @xmath15 ) . as can be seen in @xcite , for a 4-dimensional vaidya metric with @xmath16 and without electric charge ( in the context of ref .",
    "@xcite , a radiating star ) , the hypersurface @xmath17 at @xmath18 in the vaidya metric is analogous to the schwarzschild hypersurface @xmath19 at schwarzschild s time coordinate @xmath20 in the kruskal metric .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite for further discussions about possible analytical extensions and properties of the horizon of the vaidya metric in the radiation coordinates ) .",
    "the cross term @xmath21 introduces extra terms in the hyperbolic equations governing the evolution of physical fields on spacetimes with the metric ( [ vaidya ] ) . typically , the double - null coordinates are far more convenient for qnm analysis .",
    "this was the main motivation of the series of works based on waugh and lake s approach @xcite , where the problem of casting the 4-dimensional vaidya metric in double - null coordinates was originally addressed .",
    "as all previous attempts to construct a general transformation from radiation to double - null coordinates had failed , waugh and lake considered the problem of solving einstein s equation with spherical symmetry directly in double - null coordinates .",
    "the resulting equations , however , are not analytically solvable in general .",
    "waugh and lake s work was revisited in @xcite , where a semi - analytical approach allowing for general mass functions was proposed .",
    "more recently this semi - analytical approach was extended to the case of an @xmath0-dimensional vaidya metric with cosmological constant @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this approach consists in a qualitative study of the null - geodesics , allowing the description of light - cones and revealing many features of the underlying causal structure .",
    "it can also be used for more quantitative analyses ; indeed , it has already enhanced considerably the accuracy of the quasinormal modes analysis of varying mass black holes @xcite , and it can also be applied to the study of gravitational collapse@xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we extend the approach proposed in @xcite and derive the double - null formulation for the most general vaidya metric : @xmath0-dimensional , in the presence of a cosmological constant , and with varying electric charge and mass .",
    "only the main results are presented .",
    "the reader can get more details on the employed semi - analytical approach in @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "we recall that the @xmath0-dimensional spherically symmetric line element in double - null coordinates @xmath22 is given by [ uv ] s^2 = -2f(u , v)uv + r^2(u , v)^2_n-2 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are non vanishing smooth functions .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of a unidirectional radial null - fluid in the eikonal approximation in the presence of an electromagnetic field @xmath25 is given by [ t ]",
    "t_ab = hk_a k_b + ( f_acf^c_b -g_ab f_cdf^cd ) , where @xmath26 is a radial null vector and @xmath27 is a smooth function characterizing the null - fluid radial flow . in the double",
    "null coordinates @xmath28 , we can choose either @xmath29 ( flow along the @xmath30-direction ) or @xmath31 ( flow along the @xmath12-direction ) .",
    "since the @xmath30 and @xmath12 directions are unspecified , it is not in fact necessary to consider flows along both directions .",
    "we will consider here , without loss of generality , the case of a flow along the @xmath12-direction , as done in @xcite .",
    "maxwell equations are given by @xmath32 where , for the metric ( [ uv ] ) , = fr^n-2_j=1^n-3 ( _ j)^n - j-2 .",
    "all geometrical quantities relevant to this work are listed in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the equations ( [ max ] ) have the following static spherically symmetric solution [ staticsol ] f^uv = - f^vu = , with all other components of the electromagnetic tensor vanishing , where @xmath14 is a constant which one identifies as the @xmath0-dimensional electric monopole charge .",
    "this case , of course , corresponds to @xmath33 . in order to allow for a time dependent charge @xmath2",
    ", one needs to assume the presence of a current j^u = , ( with all other components vanishing ) which is obtained from the continuity equation @xmath34 , as done , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "such a current must naturally appear , as we will see , in the @xmath27 function characterizing the radial flow in the energy momentum tensor ( [ t ] ) .",
    "we note here that our solution ( [ staticsol ] ) for @xmath35 with @xmath2 also consistently satisfies the sourceless maxwell equations ( [ maxwell2 ] ) .",
    "einstein equations with cosmological constant @xmath3 [ eee ] r_ab - g_abr = -g_ab + 8t_ab , imply that , for the energy - momentum tensor ( [ t ] ) , [ contr ] r = -2 , where ( [ staticsol ] ) was used .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 components of einstein equations for this case read simply @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote , respectively , differentiation with respect to @xmath30 and @xmath12 as usual .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 components are , respectively , @xmath43 for @xmath44 , differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) with respect to @xmath30 and then inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) leads to [ a ] - r^n-1 - = -m , ( after integration with respect to @xmath30 ) where @xmath1 is an arbitrary integration function that we already known from @xcite that can be interpreted as the mass of the solution . the @xmath45 case must be considered separately , in an analogous way as done for @xmath46 in @xcite , and the most important results are presented in the appendix .",
    "now , differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) with respect to @xmath12 and using ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ a ] ) gives [ hh ] h = - ( ) ( m_,v - ) .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is ready to be integrated [ b ] f = 2br_,u , where @xmath47 is another arbitrary ( but nonvanishing ) integration function . from ( [ hh ] ) and ( [ b ] )",
    ", one has [ h ] h = -2 ( ) ( m_,v - ) . finally , by using ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ b ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) can be written as [ r2 ] r_,v = -b ( 1 - - r^2 + ) . note that ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ b ] ) reproduce ( [ a ] ) .",
    "einstein equations are , therefore , equivalent to the equations ( [ b ] ) , ( [ h ] ) , and ( [ r2 ] ) , generalizing the previous results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    ".    as already mentioned , the physical interpretation of the arbitrary integration functions @xmath1 and @xmath47 are the same of the @xmath46 case .",
    "transforming from the double - null coordinates back to the radiation coordinates by the coordinate change @xmath48 , the metric ( [ uv ] ) will read [ uv1 ] s^2 = 4br_,v v^2 - 4brv + r^2 ^ 2_n-2 , where ( [ b ] ) was explicitly used . comparing ( [ vaidya ] ) and",
    "( [ uv1 ] ) and taking ( [ r2 ] ) into account , it is clear that with the choice @xmath49 the function @xmath1 indeed represents the mass of the @xmath0-dimensional charged solution .",
    "the coordinate transformation leading to ( [ uv1 ] ) also ensures that the vaidya metric in radiation coordinates ( [ vaidya ] ) and the double null metric ( [ uv ] ) constructed in this paper are ( locally ) isometric .",
    "it is important to stress this fact , given the absence of a birkhoff theorem for non vacuum spacetimes .    as in the @xmath46 case",
    ", the weak energy condition applied for ( [ t ] ) requires , from ( [ h ] ) , that    @xmath50    if there are both mass and charge variations , then @xmath51 and @xmath52 can not be chosen arbitrarily ( see @xcite for a discussion ) and must chosen satisfy the energy condition ( [ energycond ] ) .    taking ( as mentioned above )",
    "@xmath53 , if we have only mass ( or charge ) varying with time , the energy condition requires that @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) be a monotonic function and fixes @xmath54 in the following way :    @xmath55    where we consider , without loss of generality , @xmath56 .",
    "the problem of constructing a double - null formulation for the general vaidya metric may be stated as follows : given the mass function @xmath1 , the electric charge function @xmath2 , the cosmological constant @xmath3 , and the constant @xmath54 , one needs to solve eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) , obtaining the function @xmath24 .",
    "then , @xmath23 and @xmath27 are calculated from ( [ b ] ) and ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the arbitrary function of @xmath30 appearing in the integration of ( [ r2 ] ) must be chosen properly @xcite , so that @xmath23 given in ( [ b ] ) is a non - vanishing function . unfortunately , as stressed previously by waugh and lake@xcite , such a procedure is not analytically solvable in general . in @xcite ,",
    "a semi - analytical procedure is introduced to attack the problem of solving eqs .",
    "( [ b])-([r2 ] ) for the @xmath46 case , generalizing in this way the results of @xcite obtained for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",

    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 ( solid lines ) are defined as usual as @xmath67 . in the exterior region ( @xmath68 ) , the constant @xmath30 null geodesics reach @xmath69 , while in the interior region they are confined , giving origin to the typical black hole causal structure . ]",
    "the approach , which we will not reproduce here , allows us to qualitatively construct conformal diagrams , identifying horizons and singularities , and also to evaluate specific geometric quantities .",
    "the main idea , however , is to solve eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) numerically as an initial value in @xmath12 , for constant @xmath30 . in other words",

    "we choose here @xmath71 . since the lines of constant @xmath30 ( or @xmath12 ) are null geodesics for any metric in double - null coordinates , knowing @xmath24 for @xmath30 constant is enough , for instance , to construct the causal conformal diagrams",

    "the striking feature in this case is the existence of three time - dependent apparent horizons @xmath90 and @xmath91 , located at the positive roots of eq . ( [ r2 ] ) , which is a 4th order polynomial in this case . ]    figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] present the behavior of the @xmath30-constant null - geodesics in two different time dependent cases : increasing charge function @xmath2 and increasing mass function @xmath1 . charge and mass variations produce opposite results for the horizons .",
    "also , @xmath66 and @xmath65 are now time dependent , and the event horizon @xmath78 is no longer coincident with the apparent horizon @xmath65 .    the case presented in fig .",
    "2 deserves a more detailed analysis .",
    "the charge increase is analogous to the mass evaporation studied in @xcite .",
    "following our discussion in section [ sec2 ] , when @xmath92 we must have @xmath93 , in order to satisfy the weak energy condition ( [ energycond ] ) .",
    "now there is a subtlety regarding the sign of @xmath54 .",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) that the sign of @xmath94 depends on the signs of @xmath54 and @xmath95 ( which is of negative sign with our choice of @xmath96 ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 and @xmath99 is timelike and @xmath100 is spacelike .",
    "however , for @xmath93 , @xmath94 has the opposite sign and the timelike and spacelike directions are now exchanged .    the transformation @xmath101 restores the temporal and spatial directions .",
    "under this transformation , eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) ( with @xmath93 ) becomes    @xmath102    which is formally identical to a case with @xmath97 , mass function @xmath103 and charge function @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , the transformed equation results in a situation with _ decreasing charge _ ,",
    "that is , a time reversal of the original situation with increasing charge . stated in a different way",
    ", this means that the case with increasing charge and @xmath93 must be interpreted as the time reversal of the case with decreasing charge and @xmath97 ( with both cases satisfying the weak energy condition ) .",
    "however , in order to describe an actual charge increase ( equivalent to an evaporation ) , we need to violate the weak energy condition , since there are no classical processes that can lead to black hole evaporation . in order to do that",
    ", we deliberately choose @xmath97 together with @xmath92 .",
    "the weak energy condition is violated , and the resulting evaporation process is shown in figure 2 .    in figure [ fig4 ]",

    "we have a qualitatively different behavior , due to the appearance of a cosmological horizon ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the calculation of the apparent horizons @xmath106 shown in figures [ fig1]-[fig5 ] follows the semi - analytic method described in refs .",
    "we can see that the curves defined by the vanishing of the r.h.s of eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) always describe the frontier between two regions of the @xmath107 plane where the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) have distinct behaviors . for @xmath108 ,",
    "the null geodesics approach the singularity , whereas for @xmath109 , the null geodesics tend to escape from the singularity .",
    "the determination of the event horizon @xmath78 is done numerically by inspection of the initial value @xmath110 .",
    "the event horizon is found as the last geodesic that escapes towards infinity and does not fall into the singularity .",
    "note that in the case of increasing charge ( or , equivalently , decreasing mass ) there are null geodesics that escape towards infinity even though they were initially inside the apparent horizon @xmath65 .",
