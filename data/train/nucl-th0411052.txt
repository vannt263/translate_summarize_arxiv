    "limited total cross - section data @xcite on carbon , and elastic and inelastic differential cross section data @xcite on carbon and calcium , drew theoretical attention already in the 1980s to the insufficiency of the impulse - approximation @xmath1 form of the @xmath0 - nucleus optical potential , where @xmath13 is the free - space @xmath10 @xmath13 matrix , particularly with respect to its reaction content ( ` reactivity ' below ) . in order to account for the increased reactivity in @xmath0 - nucleus interactions , siegel _",
    "et al._@xcite suggested that nucleons ` swell ' in the nuclear medium , primarily by increasing the dominant hard - core @xmath14 phase shift .",
    "et al._@xcite suggested that the extra reactivity was due to the reduced in - medium masses of exchanged vector mesons , and this was subsequently worked out in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "another source for increased reactivity in @xmath0 - nucleus interactions was discussed in the 1990s and is due to meson exchange - current effects @xcite .",
    "some further experimental progress was made during the early 1990s , consisting mostly of measuring attenuation cross sections in @xmath0 transmission experiments at the bnl - ags on deuterium and several other nuclear targets in the momentum range @xmath15 mev / c @xcite and of measuring @xmath0 quasielastic scattering on several targets at 705 mev / c @xcite .",
    "new measurements of @xmath0 elastic and inelastic differential cross sections on c and ca at 715 mev / c were reported in ref.@xcite and analyzed in ref.@xcite , and self - consistent final values of @xmath0 integral ( reaction and total ) cross sections on @xmath16li , @xmath17c , @xmath18si and @xmath19ca were published in refs.@xcite . by the late 1990s , experimentation in @xmath0 - nuclear physics has subsided , and with it died out also theoretical interest .",
    "the subject was reviewed last time in hyp97 , concluding that  every experiment of @xmath0 mesons with complex nuclei finds cross sections larger than those predicted \" @xcite ; and based on analyses of @xmath0 - nuclear integral cross sections @xcite , it was concluded that  at present theory misses some unconventional in - medium effects \" @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5(1540 ) exotic baryon @xcite provides a new mode of reactivity to @xmath0 - nuclear interactions .",
    "the @xmath5 couples directly to nucleons , @xmath20 , but its small width of order 1 mev or less @xcite indicates that this coupling is weak .",
    "the @xmath21 phase - shift input to the @xmath1 optical potential in the vicinity of the @xmath5 mass ( corresponding to @xmath22 mev / c ) is derived from @xmath23 scattering data across the @xmath5 resonance energy . therefore , whatever the @xmath24 coupling is , its effect is already included at least implicitly in the @xmath1 impulse approximation .",
    "a deuteron target also allows for a two - body production reaction @xmath25 with threshold at @xmath26 mev / c @xcite , but the available @xmath23 scattering data do not give any evidence for the opening of such a production channel .",
    "it is plausible that _ denser _ nuclear targets would help to fuse the @xmath0 s @xmath27 quark together with two @xmath28 diquarks , each of which belongs to a distinct nucleon , into the @xmath29 configuration according to the jaffe - wilczek model of @xmath5 @xcite , and similarly for the diquark - triquark karliner - lipkin model @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should look for traces of @xmath0 _ absorption _ on two nucleons , @xmath30 , in normal nuclei . in the present work",
    "we show that traces of such two - body @xmath0 absorption may be identified in @xmath0 - nucleus dynamics and help resolve the long - standing anomalies in the @xmath0 - nucleus integral cross sections .",
    "we determine the @xmath0 absorption cross section on nuclei at @xmath31 mev / c which is the closest momentum to the @xmath5 rest mass , where good data are available .",
    "our results provide the first concrete demonstration that nuclear targets are potentially useful in the study of exotic baryons .",
    "in the calculations presented below the klein gordon equation is solved , using the simplest possible @xmath1 form for the optical potential @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the reduced energy in the cm system , @xmath34 is a kinematical factor resulting from the transformation of amplitudes between the @xmath35 and the @xmath0 - nucleus cm systems and @xmath36 is the ( complex ) value of the isospin - averaged @xmath35 scattering amplitude in the forward direction .",
    "the coulomb potential due to the charge distribution of the nucleus is included .",

    "et al._@xcite showed that no _ effective _ value for @xmath36 could be found that fits satisfactorily the reaction and total cross sections derived from the bnl - ags transmission measurements at @xmath38 mev / c on @xmath16li , @xmath17c , @xmath18si , @xmath19ca .",

    "the @xmath41/n of this density - independent fit is very high .",

    "in fact , it was shown _ empirically _",
    "@xcite that the average nuclear density @xmath50 provides such discrimination and is instrumental in achieving good agreement with experiment .",

    "the superiority of this @xmath53 version compared to the @xmath54 one is very clearly observed .",
    "this conclusion remains valid also when the data for the elastic scattering of 715 mev / c @xmath0 by @xmath16li and @xmath17c @xcite are included in the analysis .",

    "these values of im@xmath36 are close to , but somewhat below the corresponding free - space values .",
    "the two - nucleon absorption coefficient im@xmath47 rises slowly with energy as appropriate to the increased phase space available to the underlying two - nucleon absorption process @xmath30 .",
    "its values in this energy range are roughly independent of the form of @xmath56 , the more conservative eq.([equ : dd1 ] ) or the more effective eq.([equ : dd2 ] ) , used to derive these values from the data .",

    "we note that our @xmath30 absorption reaction is related to the mechanism proposed recently in ref . @xcite as causing strong @xmath5 - nuclear attraction , based on @xmath59 two - meson cloud contributions to the self energy of @xmath5 in nuclear matter .",

    "the error bars plotted are due to the uncertainty in the parameter im@xmath47 .",
    "it is seen that these calculated absorption cross sections , for the relatively dense targets of c , si and ca , are proportional to the mass number @xmath65 , and the cross section per target nucleon due to im@xmath66 is estimated as close to 3.5 mb .",
    "although the less successful eq.([equ : dd1 ] ) gives cross sections larger by @xmath67 , this value should be regarded an upper limit , since the best - fit density - dependent potentials of refs.@xcite yield values smaller than 3.5 mb by a similar amount . the experience gained from studying @xmath68-nuclear absorption @xcite leads to the conclusion that @xmath69 is smaller than the extrapolation of @xmath70 in fig .",

    "such a one - step process at the @xmath5 mass ( @xmath79 mev / c ) @xmath80 may be compared to pion absorption near the ( 3,3 ) resonance energy @xcite , where the primary two - nucleon absorption mechanism is through a direct @xmath81 production @xmath82 with @xmath83 mb . scaling this value by the ratio of coupling constants squared @xmath84 , assuming @xmath85 and @xmath86 mev , we estimate a cross section level of 0.03 mb for the one - step production process at the @xmath5 resonance energy . [ assuming @xmath87 , the one - step production cross section is lower by at least another order of magnitude . ]",
    "the one - step cross section affordable by the neutron fermi motion at @xmath31 mev / c would be considerably smaller than this estimate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the two - nucleon reaction need not involve the suppressed @xmath24 coupling and its cross section , @xmath77 mb at @xmath31 mev / c , should depend smoothly on energy .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated a very good agreement between experiment and calculation for all the available integral cross - section data by adding to the @xmath1 optical potential a density - dependent term which simulates absorption channels .",
    "we have identified these absorption channels , as exhibited by the anomalous reactivity established systematically in past phenomenological analyses of @xmath0 - nuclear interactions , with the @xmath5 production reaction @xmath4 with threshold at @xmath26 mev / c .",
    "the analysis of these data is consistent with an upper limit of about 3.5 mb on the @xmath0 absorption cross section per nucleon , for @xmath5 production on the denser nuclei of c , si , ca , and indicates a sub - millibarn cross section for @xmath5 production on deuterium .",
    "we urge experimenters to look for the @xmath75 two - body production reaction @xcite which requires experimental accuracies of 0.1 mb in cross section measurements . given the magnitude of the @xmath0 nuclear absorption cross sections , as derived in the present work , we also urge doing ( @xmath88 ) experiments on nuclear targets .",
