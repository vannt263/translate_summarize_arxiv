    "squeezing is the reduction of the noise variance of an optical field below the quantum noise limit ( qnl ) .",

    "@xcite proposed a long - distance quantum communication network that is based on the interaction of atomic ensembles with squeezed and entangled light beams .",
    "to achieve such goals , squeezed light at atomic wavelengths is required .    conventionally , squeezing can be generated via efficient non - linear optical processes , such as @xmath0 parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "the transparency windows of non - linear optical crystals , however , may not coincide with some atomic transitions .",
    "for example , commonly used sodium and rubidium atomic transition wavelengths are difficult to access via @xmath0 crystals .",
    "another method of generating squeezed light is to utilize the @xmath1 atomic kerr effect at the required atomic wavelength .",
    "these experiments , however , require ultra - cold atoms confined in cavities and are therefore technically challenging @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a proposal for generating atomic wavelength squeezing via the single traversal of an optical field through a thermal vapour cell @xcite .",
    "this proposal promises a simple , scalable and cost - effective means of generating squeezed light for rb and potentially for other atomic species . due to the ac stark shift and optical pumping - induced refractive index changes of the atomic vapour",
    ", an elliptically polarized input field will experience an intensity dependent rotation of the optical polarization axes @xcite .",
    "this effect , known as polarization self - rotation ( psr ) , was suggested as a non - linear mechanism for squeezing @xcite .",

    "@xcite developed a phenomenological model that treats psr as a cross - phase modulation mechanism .",
    "in the situation of a linearly polarized input field propagating through the vapour cell , a non - linear cross - phase interaction occurs between the two circularly polarized field components .",
    "this results in the squeezing of the output vacuum field mode that is orthogonally polarized to the input field .",
    "analogous to cross - phase modulation squeezing in optical fibres @xcite , it was suggested that 6 db of psr squeezing is possible with thermal rb vapour cell .",

    "@xcite reported an observation of 0.85  db maximum squeezing from a rb vapour cell and attributed their squeezing to psr .    the phenomenological model of psr squeezing by matsko _",

    "@xcite pointed out the importance of noise terms arising from the atomic dynamics that could possibly degrade , if not totally destroy , squeezing .",
    "the model of josse _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was based on the interaction of a linearly polarized field with 4-level atoms .",
    "they showed that in the high saturation regime , the atomic noise contribution could potentially be larger than the squeezing term . nevertheless , in the low saturation regime and at sideband frequencies larger than the atomic relaxation rate , squeezing on the vacuum mode",
    "can be generated via the cross - kerr effect induced by the bright field .",
    "such a regime , however , can only be obtained with ultra - cold trapped atoms enclosed in an optical cavity @xcite .",

    "@xcite , no optical squeezing was observed .",
    "instead , we observed excess quadrature noise above the qnl for a wide range of parameters .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we relate experimental results to the theory and show that under our experimental conditions , where atomic spontaneous emission is significant , squeezing is overwhelmed by atomic noise terms .",

    "@xcite proposed that the psr effect in atomic vapour can be used to generate vacuum squeezing .",
    "their proposal was related to the mechanism of cross - phase coupling between two orthogonal polarization fields .",

    "such a model predicts squeezing values of 6 - 8  db below the qnl .",
    "however , crucial details such as spontaneous emission and atomic noise are completely ignored , the effects of which can reduce , if not completely destroy , squeezing .      since optical pumping is the main cause of psr in the high saturation regime @xcite , which is the relevant regime in our experiment , we can approximate the @xmath3 and @xmath4 lines of @xmath2rb using a 4-level atom model .",

    "many effects have not been taken into account in the various models discussed in this paper .",
    "firstly , the presence of resonance fluorescence has not been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that psr can not generate squeezing in the low saturation regime because of optical pumping processes .",
    "we have shown in this paper that this is also true in the high saturation regime where the resonance fluorescence noise dominates over the cross - kerr squeezing term , _ even _ at high detection frequencies .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with other observations @xcite .",
    "secondly , none of the models presented have included the doppler effect .",
    "since we are dealing with thermal atoms , the passage of light through the atoms will give rise to a range of observed atomic detuning . the integrated effect due to doppler broadening",
    "will be detrimental to the observation of squeezing .",
    "thirdly , the multi - level hyperfine structure of the excited states of @xmath2rb have only been considered for the theoretical fits to the classical psr results , but have not been included in any of the squeezing model .",
    "the experimental psr data presented in this paper clearly shows that the multi - level hyperfine structure causes observable asymmetry in the psr spectrum . this feature can not be explained by any of the theoretical models presented in sec .",
    "[ thy ] . the multi - level theory can be expanded to include langevin noise terms . however , a simple 4-level atom model is sufficient to demonstrate the lack of squeezing .",
    "the multi - level structure is also certainly less favourable to the generation of squeezing when compared with a simplified 4-level model .",
    "different hyperfine levels will not contribute constructively towards a collective interaction that will generate squeezing .",
    "the added noise from these different levels will add up significantly .",
    "the inclusion of doppler broadening and multi - level effects would only result in a dominance of the atomic noise term over the squeezing term .",
    "finally , the propagation of the transverse intensity profile of the input field has been totally ignored in all models .",
    "a full treatment of the process should include the multi - modal analysis of the evolution of the transverse field modes during propagation through the vapour cell . in the high saturation regime and for high atomic densities , self - focussing",
    "is readily observed .",
    "this is due to the atom induced kerr lens - effect on the optical field .",
    "thus the centre of the field intensity distribution will undergo greater psr than the edges .",
    "the cross - kerr non - linearity and the atomic absorption used in our calculations is a result of an `` integrated '' effect of the various transverse modes .",
    "it therefore does not model accurately the situation of the experiment .",
    "similar to the previous argument , it is unlikely that the multi - modal consideration of the process will yield better squeezing .",
    "we have presented experimental results of psr from two independent laboratories and have observed no squeezing .",
    "instead we have observed excess noise in the output field spectrum at all sideband frequencies .",
    "we have modelled semi - classically the multi - level hyperfine structure of @xmath2rb and obtained theoretical fits to the experimental psr data .",
    "our multi - level modelling can predict the asymmetry in the psr , that is due to the presence of other hyperfine excited states .",
    "we considered a quantum mechanical 4-level atomic model and showed that the squeezing term is overwhelmed by atomic noise terms in the situation of a thermal vapour .",
    "the effects of resonance fluorescence , the doppler effect and the multi - level hyperfine structure of @xmath2rb all contribute to overwhelm the squeezing term .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a full quantum mechanical treatment of a multi - level @xmath2rb atom will yield a result where squeezing can not be generated . in spite of this , the 4-level atom model shows that squeezing can be generated in the situation of cold atoms where the doppler effect is negligible .",
    "when the input field is off - resonance , the non - linearity is large but the absorption low , such that the atomic noise term does not overwhelm the squeezing term .",
    "we would like to thank p.  drummond , w.  p.  bowen , j.  j.  longdell and a.  lvovsky for fruitful discussions and paul tant for technical support .",
