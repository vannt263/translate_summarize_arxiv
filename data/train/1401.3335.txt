    "young stars are often variable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are known to undergo significant eruptions marking substantial increases in their accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , during which they are thought to accrete a significant fraction of their total mass . a class of young stellar objects ( ysos ) that repeatedly undergo these eruptions , named `` exors '' after the prototype ex  lupi ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has been the subject of recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the physical mechanisms responsible for triggering these outbursts remain poorly understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a recent study of the 2008 ex  lupi outburst by @xcite suggests that a sub - stellar binary companion could be involved .",
    "other possible causes include the magnetorotational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , disk fragmentation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and instabilities at the disk truncation radius from the stellar magnetosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "among the defining characteristics of exors are that they erupt every few years with variable peak luminosities , typical visual amplitudes of up to @xmath6  mag , and outburst durations of a few months to a year . at minimum light , exors resemble classical t tauri stars ( ttss ) with absorption spectra like those of late k- or early m - dwarfs and a strong line at 6707  @xcite . at maximum light ,",
    "their spectra are dominated by a hot continuum and quiescent absorption features appear as emission lines , indicating increased accretion @xcite .",
    "in this letter we describe the discovery and follow - up observations of a new exor - type outburst , asassn-13db .",
    "the transient was discovered by the all - sky automated survey for supernovae ( asas - sn ] ) , a long - term project to monitor the whole sky on a rapid cadence to find nearby supernovae and other transients ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "our transient source detection pipeline was triggered on 2013 september 24 , detecting a change in @xmath7-band magnitude from @xmath8 to @xmath9 over a span of @xmath10  15 days in the red source sdss j051011.01@xmath0032826.2 ( hereafter sdssj0510 ) .",
    "the source is located roughly @xmath11 ( @xmath10 50 pc ) from the orion nebula and roughly @xmath12 ( @xmath10  10 pc ) from the l1615/l1616 cloud , both regions of star formation at a distance of @xmath13 pc ( averaging recent estimates from @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "we assume this distance for sdssj0510 .",
    "follow - up spectroscopic observations with the magellan echellette spectrograph ( mage ; @xcite ) on 2013 september 26 showed a highly unusual spectrum with a plethora of emission lines , and we began a follow - up campaign in order to characterize this transient .    in  [ sec : obs ] we describe pre - outburst archival observations , including a previous outburst recorded in 2010@xmath02011 , and new data taken during and after the outburst as part of our follow - up campaign . in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we analyze these data and describe the properties of the star in quiescence and in outburst .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : disc ] we compare these properties to those of known exors and the prototype ex  lupi .",
    "here we summarize the available archival data in quiescence and outburst as well as our new photometric and spectroscopic observations .",
    "we retrieved archival photometry of sdssj0510 in quiescence spanning the optical to the mid - infrared ( ir ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) based on a coordinate cross - match to the asas - sn position .",
    "there are no spitzer , herschel , or akari observations of the source .",
    "we used the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 magnitudes in  [ sec : sed ] to construct a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for the progenitor , as shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] . from the sdss data , and using m - dwarf templates from @xcite , we estimate the quiescent v - band magnitude to be @xmath8 .",
    "after the discovery of asassn-13db , we examined existing data for sdssj0510 from the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; * ? ? ? * ) , the mobile astronomical system of telescope robots ( master ) , and the near - earth asteroid tracking program ( neat ) .",
    "the neat data indicate that sdssj0510 did not have any eruptions between december 2000 and february 2003 , but we found that it had a previously unreported outburst in late 2010 and early 2011 that was observed by crts and master ( denisenko et al . , private communication ) .",
    "sdssj0510 had @xmath17 on 2010 november 08 ( crts ) and 2011 october 2 ( crts ) , but had @xmath18 in 2010 december ( multiple crts epochs ) and was brighter than the present outburst with @xmath19 on 2011 january 22 ( master ) .",
    "the length and magnitude of this previous outburst are consistent with a large exor - type event .",
    "the emission lines seen in the initial follow - up spectrum of asassn-13db indicated that it must be hot and should have increased ultraviolet ( uv ) emission . based on this ,",
