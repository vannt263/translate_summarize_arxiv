    "the author expects that theorem [ thm : main - intro ] is true for any conjugate self - dual discrete series representation @xmath7 ; in fact , we can easily verify it for a character twist of the steinberg representation ( see remark [ rem : steinberg ] ) .",
    "it seems also an interesting question to extend theorem [ thm : main - intro ] to general division algebras .",
