    "the h@xmath0  molecular ion has long been considered to play an important role in the chemistry of dense molecular clouds , as it initiates the network of ion - neutral reactions @xcite that is responsible for the wealth of molecules observed by infrared and radio astronomers .",
    "however , h@xmath0  has not been considered to be an important species in diffuse clouds , because it is thought to be destroyed rapidly by dissociative recombination with electrons , which are abundant in diffuse clouds . for the purposes of the present study",
    ", we do not make a distinction between diffuse and translucent clouds , but simply use `` diffuse '' to indicate sightlines where co is not the dominant reservoir of carbon ( in contrast to dense clouds ) .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0  in the diffuse interstellar medium toward the galactic center @xcite and toward the visible star cygnus ob2 12 @xcite with similar column densities to those of dense clouds @xcite was therefore quite surprising .",
    "these observational results imply either a very long pathlength ( hundreds of parsecs ) of absorbing material , or a serious problem with the standard model of diffuse cloud chemistry .",
    "various attempts have been made to explain the abundance of h@xmath0toward cygnus ob2 12 while preserving the standard model of the chemistry , either by adjusting all parameters to optimize h@xmath0  @xcite or by postulating an additional ionization source for h@xmath3 molecules peculiar to the neighborhood of the cygnus ob2 association @xcite .",
    "we have conducted a small survey of twelve diffuse cloud sources with the aim of determining whether the sightline toward cygnus ob2 12 is unique , or whether high column densities of h@xmath0  are common in diffuse clouds . as a result of this survey",
    ", we have detected h@xmath0  in seven diffuse cloud sources ( cygnus ob2 12 , cygnus ob2 5 , hd 183143 , hd 20041 , wr 104 , wr 118 , and wr 121 ) , and obtained upper limits toward five other sources ( hd 194279 , hd 168607 , p cygni , @xmath4 ori , and @xmath5 oph ) .",
    "for cygnus ob2 12 and 5 and hd 181343 , we have also obtained infrared and radio spectra of co , as well as high - resolution visible spectra of relevant atoms and molecules .",
    "we have also obtained infrared co spectra towards wr 104 and wr 108 .",
    "these results demonstrate the ubiquity of h@xmath0  in diffuse clouds , and suggest that there is a `` global '' problem with the current models . in this respect ,",
    "h@xmath0  represents a major problem in diffuse cloud chemistry , reminiscent of the diffuse interstellar bands and ch@xmath6 .",
    "the stellar parameters of our targets are listed in table [ targets ] , and a summary of the observations is provided in table [ obslog ] .",
    "the @xmath7(1,1)@xmath8 line of h@xmath0   at 3.715 @xmath9 m was observed using the phoenix spectrometer on the mayall 4-meter telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "the h@xmath0  observations were performed in three runs ( july 1998 , june 2000 , and march 2001 ) .",
    "the cgs4 facility spectrometer on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) was used in july 2000 and may 2001 to study the @xmath7(1,0)@xmath7(1,1)@xmath10 doublet of h@xmath0  near 3.668 @xmath9 m .",
    "the three observed h@xmath0  rotation - vibration transitions belong to the fundamental band of the @xmath11 degenerate bending mode , and arise from the lowest allowed rotational states ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) = ( 1,1 ) and ( 1,0 ) .",
    "the old notation [ e.g. , @xmath7(1,1)@xmath6 ] has been superseded by a more flexible notation [ e.g. , @xmath7(1,1)@xmath10 ] which uses @xmath16 and @xmath17 in place of @xmath18 and @xmath19 [ for a complete description of the new standard notation for h@xmath0 , see @xcite or @xcite ] .",
    "infrared spectra of portions of the fundamental ( @xmath20=1 - 0 ) and overtone ( @xmath20=2 - 0 ) infrared bands of co were also obtained .",
    "the fundamental band was studied toward cygnus ob2 12 and cygnus ob2 5 with phoenix in july 1999 and june 2000 , and toward hd 183143 , wr 104 , and wr 118 with cgs4 in may 2001 . the overtone band of co was searched for with phoenix toward hd 183143 in june 1997 and toward cygnus ob2 12 in july 1999 .",
    "all the infrared data were reduced using the procedure outlined in @xcite , which is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "object spectra were ratioed by ( scaled ) standard spectra in order to remove the many strong atmospheric absorption lines in these regions .",
    "the wavelength calibration was achieved using telluric absorption lines , and is estimated to be accurate to roughly 2 km / s .",
    "the resolving power of the phoenix spectrometer was roughly 40,000 until 1998 , and approximately 60,000 during 19992001 .",
    "the cgs4 spectrometer was used with the long camera , yielding a resolving power of 40,000 .",
    "high resolution visible spectra of atoms and molecules of interest were obtained using the coud spectrometer on the smith 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory .",
    "a total of three echelle settings were used .",
    "the first covered the k i line at 7699   and the cn a - x @xmath20=2 - 0 @xmath21 line at 7875  . the second covered the c@xmath3 a - x @xmath20=2 - 0 band near 8760  .",
    "these two echelle settings were used with the f1e2 configuration and the 0.2  slit , which yielded a resolving power of about 200,000 .",
    "the third echelle setting covered ca i at 4227  , ca ii at 3934  , ch at 4300  , ch@xmath6 at 4232  , and cn b - x @xmath20=0 - 0 near 3874  .",
    "this setting was used with the f1e1 configuration and the 0.6  slit , to yield a resolving power of approximately 120,000 .",
    "the mcdonald data were reduced using standard iraf routines ( ccdproc and doecslit ) .",
    "it was not generally necessary to ratio the visible spectra by standard stars , due to the weakness and paucity of atmospheric absorption lines in the regions of interest .",
    "wavelength calibration was achieved using comparison spectra of a th - ar lamp , and is estimated to be good to about 0.01   in all cases .",
    "rotational spectra of co in the cygnus ob2 association were obtained at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) for @xmath12=1 - 0 , and the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) for @xmath12=2 - 1 and 3 - 2 .",
    "the cso spectra were obtained using position switching with an `` off '' position of 30 south .",
    "this position has significant @xmath22co emission , but no detectable @xmath23co emission compared with a more distant off position , which is important as the @xmath23co data is used in the interpretation of the infrared co lines .",
    "the nro spectra were obtained using position switching with an off position of @xmath24 , which was found to be more free of co emission .",
    "co spectra toward hd 183143 were also obtained at the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) for @xmath12=2 - 1 , and at nro for @xmath12=1 - 0 , using frequency switching . in all cases ,",
    "data were reduced using the standard procedures .",
    "in our 1998 observing run at kitt peak , we detected h@xmath0  for the first time toward cygnus ob2 5 , which lies approximately 6 ( 3 pc at 1.7 kpc ) away from cygnus ob2 12 .",
    "although the h@xmath0  @xmath7(1,1)@xmath8 line was unfortunately doppler shifted under the telluric ch@xmath25 feature near 37152  , we are confident that the detection is secure , because the other telluric ch@xmath25 line ( near 37158  ) is removed very effectively by ratioing with a standard star , and because we observed a similar h@xmath0  feature in cygnus ob2 12 at the same velocity with an equivalent width consistent with our earlier observations @xcite .",
    "our kitt peak h@xmath0  observations are summarized in figure [ kpno_h3plus ] .",
    "our 1998 run also yielded detections of h@xmath0  toward the wolf - rayet stars wr 121 , wr 104 , and wr 118 .",
    "the source wr 118 is interesting in that it shows two h@xmath0  components , which have similar ( though not the same ) spacing as the two telluric ch@xmath25 lines .",
    "consequently , the scaling and ratioing by the standard star was performed by choosing parameters which minimized the residuals of ch@xmath25 lines elsewhere in the spectrum ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the inferred velocities of the peaks ( @xmath1 + 5 and + 48 km / s ) would occur at heliocentric distances of @xmath10.5 and 3 kpc , respectively , assuming a flat galactic rotation curve with @xmath26 = 220 km / s , @xmath27 = 8 kpc , and @xmath17 = 21@xmath28.80 .",
    "these distances do not exceed the estimated distance to the source ( @xmath29 = 14 , or @xmath30 6.3 kpc ) obtained from the observed v magnitude of 22 , the visual extinction @xmath31 = 12.8 from @xcite , and the absolute magnitude @xmath32 = -4.8 for wc9 stars @xcite .    finally , our 1998 kitt peak run yielded a non - detection toward hd 194279 , toward which ch is observed with a heliocentric velocity of -11.8 km / s ( g.  galazutdinov , private communication ) . this source , along with the wolf - rayet stars , was chosen for study because the 3.4 @xmath9 m aliphatic carbon feature ( a signature of diffuse clouds ) had been detected by @xcite .",
    "our june 2000 run at kitt peak yielded the first detection of h@xmath0  toward a more traditional diffuse cloud source , hd 183143 .",
    "two components of h@xmath0were seen , in agreement with the visible spectra of other molecules ( see below ) , although the blue component was somewhat affected by the telluric ch@xmath25 line . during this run",
    ", we also obtained non - detections toward p cygni [ which has an lsr velocity of ch@xmath6 of -9 km / s @xcite ] and toward @xmath5 oph [ which has an lsr velocity of co of -0.79 km / s @xcite ] .",
    "our march 2001 run at kitt peak yielded a detection of h@xmath0  toward the least reddened star to date , hd 20041 .",
    "we also obtained an upper limit of h@xmath0absorption towards @xmath4 ori .",
    "our run at ukirt in july 2000 ( see figure [ ukirt_h3plus ] ) confirmed the detections of h@xmath0  toward cygnus ob2 5 and hd 183143 . in the case of hd 183143 ,",
    "the two - component velocity structure is very clear .",
    "for both the cygnus ob2 5 and hd 183143 observations , instrumental artifacts were present in the `` negative '' spectrum  these features changed in intensity ( and sometimes disappeared ) depending on exactly which rows of the array were extracted , while the h@xmath0  features were consistently present .",
    "we also obtained a non - detection toward hd 168607 [ which has a heliocentric ch velocity of 22 km / s @xcite ] .    in may 2001 at ukirt",
    ", we confirmed the detections of h@xmath0  toward the wolf - rayet stars wr 104 and wr 108 by using the @xmath7(1,1)@xmath10r(1,0 ) doublet .",
    "the separation of the two velocity components toward wr 118 is comparable to the spacing between the two h@xmath0  transitions , so that the @xmath7(1,0 ) of the blue component and the @xmath7(1,1)@xmath10 of the red component are overlapped .",
    "a table of the observed h@xmath0  line parameters is given in table [ h3pluslines ] .",
    "the observed equivalent widths have been converted to column densities under the assumption that the lines are optically thin , using the transition dipole moments calculated by j.  k.  g.  watson , as listed in @xcite",
    ".      a brief look at the high resolution infrared spectrum of co toward cygnus ob2 12 and cygnus ob2 5 was obtained during test and engineering time with phoenix at kitt peak in july 1999 .",
    "followup observations with longer integration time in june 2000 yielded higher signal - to - noise spectra , displayed in figure [ coir ] .",
    "the observations of cygnus ob2 12 clearly show the two closely - spaced ( @xmath1 5 km / s ) velocity components observed in the mm - wave spectrum from jcmt @xcite .",
    "the infrared lines suggest a co excitation temperature of @xmath110 k toward cygnus ob2 12 , but this should not be taken as an indication of the kinetic temperature of the gas due to the effect of spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "the infrared co line parameters are listed in table [ ircolines ] .",
    "we have adopted the transition dipole moments of @xcite .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the cygnus ob2 12 spectrum is clearly not high enough to rely on the measured equivalent widths of the individual components , particularly because of the contamination of the telluric lines .",
    "however , we can estimate the column density of co by assuming that the true equivalent widths of the two components have the same ratio as the integrated areas of the components in the @xmath23co emission spectrum , and by adopting the @xmath33-values of the @xmath23co in estimating the saturation corrections .",
    "this analysis was performed with the high - quality @xmath23co spectrum obtained at cso ( shown in figure [ neal ] ; the mm - wave line parameters are listed in table [ mmcolines ] ) .",
    "we assume that the 7 km / s peak carries 0.39 of the equivalent width ( and has @xmath33=0.75 km / s ) , and that the 12 km / s peak carries 0.61 of the equivalent width ( and has @xmath33=0.88 km / s ) . with these assumptions we estimate a total co column density of @xmath34 @xmath35 in front of cygnus ob2 12",
    "this estimate is considerably higher than the estimate of @xmath36 @xmath35 given in @xcite , but still much lower than the total column density of carbon ( @xmath37 @xmath35 ) inferred from the color excess .",
    "we have also obtained an upper limit on the co column density toward cygnus ob2 12 , based on our failure to detect the @xmath20=2 - 0 overtone with phoenix .",
    "the upper limit on the @xmath20=2 - 0 features yield an upper limit ( 3@xmath38 ) of n(co ) @xmath39 @xmath35 .",
    "this suggests that at most about 10% of the carbon along the line of sight to cygnus ob2 12 can be in the form of co , and that this sightline does not consist of dense clouds .    using the @xmath23co data from cso for @xmath12=2 - 1 and from nro for @xmath12=1 - 0 ( see figure [ nobeyama12 ] )",
    ", we performed an analysis using an lvg code to calculate the statistical equilibrium , assuming a temperature of about 30 k ( consistent with the c@xmath3 analysis of  [ c2 ] and the h@xmath0  analysis of  [ inferred ] ) . if the density ( @xmath40 @xmath2 ) derived from the analysis of c@xmath3 toward cygnus ob2 12 is assumed , the @xmath23co column density , @xmath41 is determined uniquely by matching the observed line emission .",
    "the results are @xmath42 @xmath35 for the 7 km / s component and @xmath43 @xmath35 for the 12 km / s component .",
    "the sum of these , @xmath44 @xmath35 , would imply a total column density of co of 2.3@xmath45 @xmath35 for isotope ratios of 50100 ; this column density is about twice that inferred from the infrared co absorption lines .",
    "if , on the other hand , we enforce agreement with the column density from the infrared absorption , and assume an isotope ratio of 100 , the @xmath23co data indicate somewhat higher densities : @xmath46 @xmath2 for the 7 km / s component , and @xmath47 @xmath2 for the 12 km / s component . while these densities are somewhat higher than inferred from c@xmath3 , it would not be surprising to have density variations , with the @xmath23co data probing the denser gas , and the c@xmath3 probing somewhat less dense gas .    the line of sight toward cygnus ob2 5 appears to have considerably less co than that toward cygnus ob2 12 , based both on the marginal detections in the infrared spectrum ( figure [ coir ] ) as well as the cso @xmath23co spectra ( figure [ neal ] ) .",
    "therefore we expect that this sightline is also dominated by diffuse cloud material , although because of the low signal - to - noise of the infrared spectrum it is difficult to estimate the co column density .",
    "in order to probe the spatial extent of the co gas in the cygnus ob2 association , we have obtained ( position - switched ) @xmath22co @xmath12=1 - 0 spectra at four other locations in the association , labelled a through d in table [ obslog ] and figure [ cygmap ] , which also shows the spectra toward cygnus ob2 12 and 5 .      to check for the presence of co in this sightline",
    ", we obtained rotational spectra of the @xmath12=2 - 1 line ( at jcmt ) and the @xmath12=1 - 0 line ( at nro ) . the jcmt results ( frequency - switched at 8 mhz and 16 mhz )",
    "are shown in figure [ jcmt ] .",
    "while the @xmath12=2 - 1 spectrum of cygnus ob2 12 showed nearly 2 k of emission at the h@xmath0  velocity , the spectrum of hd 183143 shows no emission at the correct velocities in excess of @xmath1 0.1 k. the nro results are shown in figure [ nro183143 ] , and provide an upper limit of @xmath1 0.2 k for the @xmath12=1 - 0 emission at the observed h@xmath0  velocities .",
    "the closest reasonable velocity component is at + 25 km / s , and is only about 0.5 k. in contrast , cygnus ob2 12 shows 3 k of emission .    during our may 2001 ukirt run",
    ", we obtained an absorption spectrum of the @xmath7-branch of the co @xmath20=1 - 0 fundamental band .",
    "this spectrum ( see figure [ newco ] and table [ ircolines ] ) shows weak absorptions near @xmath48 25 km / s , in agreement with the radio spectra . because of the fairly small ( geocentric ) doppler shift ( @xmath1 11 km / s ) at the time of the observation , it is difficult to accurately measure the column density , but it is clear that the total co column density is less than @xmath49 @xmath35 .",
    "a previously obtained phoenix spectrum of the @xmath20=2 - 0 overtone band ( from june 1997 ) provides a less stringent upper limit on the total co column density of @xmath50 @xmath35 .",
    "both the radio and infrared results demonstrate that there is very little ( if any ) co associated with the h@xmath0  toward hd 183143 .      at ukirt in may 2001",
    ", we obtained spectra of the co fundamental band toward the wolf - rayet stars wr 104 and wr 118 .",
    "the spectra are shown in figure [ newco ] and the line parameters are listed in table [ ircolines ] .",
    "wr 104 shows a single velocity component centered at @xmath48 21 km / s  surprisingly , this is different from the velocity of the h@xmath0(@xmath1 10 km / s ) !",
    "wr 118 has a very complicated velocity structure , which we have fit with four gaussian components .",
    "the lowest velocity component at @xmath48 10 km / s may be associated with the h@xmath0component at @xmath48 5 km / s , and the blended components near @xmath48 4055 km / s are consistent with the second h@xmath0component at @xmath48 48 km / s .    without any radio spectra of these sources , it is difficult to attempt saturation corrections , so we have simply listed in table [ ircolines ] the column densities in the limit that the lines are optically thin . in this limit ,",
    "wr 104 has n(co ) @xmath51 @xmath35 and wr 118 has n(co ) @xmath52 @xmath35 ( in the @xmath12=03 levels ) .",
    "the c@xmath3 a - x @xmath20=2 - 0 band was clearly detected toward cygnus ob2 12 at mcdonald , as shown in figure [ c2spectra ] .",
    "each line appears as a clear doublet with a separation comparable to that of the co , except for the @xmath53(8 ) line which is blended with @xmath54(4 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured separately for the two velocity components , except for the @xmath53(8 ) + @xmath54(4 ) blend , for which only the total equivalent width could be measured . the contribution of @xmath54(4 )",
    "was estimated from the strength of @xmath53(4 ) , which permitted an estimate of the @xmath53(8 ) equivalent width for the sum of the two velocity components .",
    "the @xmath53(10 ) line was contaminated by an atmospheric h@xmath3o absorption line , and the spectra were ratioed by that of @xmath55 cep in order to remove the contribution of the telluric line .",

    "column densities have been determined assuming the lines are optically thin , using the oscillator strength @xmath56 of @xcite .    using the method of @xcite , and assuming the scaling factor for the radiation field @xmath57 and the c@xmath3h@xmath3 collisional cross - section @xmath58 @xmath59",
    ", we can estimate the number density @xmath60 of collision partners , as well as the kinetic temperature @xmath61 .",

    "these values are fairly well constrained by the observational data  it is exceedingly unlikely ( i.e.  it requires more than a 3@xmath38 error in at least one of the measurements ) that the density is outside the range 150600 @xmath2 or that the temperature is outside the range 2555 k.    the spectrum of cygnus ob2 5 also shows a hint of the doublet structure , but the signal - to - noise of the spectrum is not sufficient to reliably measure the equivalent widths of the individual components",
    ". therefore we have measured only the total equivalent widths , which are reported in table [ c25table ] .",
    "an analysis of the rotational excitation ( while very uncertain ) suggests that the density exceeds 800 @xmath2 and that the temperature lies in the range 6090 k. according to @xcite , chemical models predict a sudden decrease in c@xmath3 abundance at densities above 10@xmath63 @xmath2 . taken with our ( uncertain ) results , this suggests that the density in the region where c@xmath3 is found is in the range 8003000 @xmath2 .    in agreement with the results of @xcite",
    ", we saw absolutely no trace of c@xmath3 towards hd 183143 . assuming the @xmath53(2 ) line would have a width of @xmath1 5 km / s , the 3@xmath38 limit on the equivalent width is about 1.7 m , which corresponds to a column density of n(@xmath12=2 ) @xmath64 @xmath35 ( comparable to gredel s upper limit ) , which is more than ten times less than that of cygnus ob2 12 !",
    "the results of our high resolution visible spectroscopy are shown in figure [ hd183143_vel ] ( hd 183143 ) , figure [ cygob25_vel ] ( cygnus ob2 5 ) , and figure [ cygob212_vel ] ( cygnus ob2 12 ) .",
    "these figures are plotted in velocity ( with respect to the local standard of rest ) , and also display the infrared measurements of h@xmath0  and co.    ch appears as a doublet in cygnus ob2 5 , with velocities consistent with the infrared co measurements .",
    "ch also appears as a doublet in hd 183143 , with remarkably similar velocity structure to the h@xmath0 .",
    "the blue wavelength ( 4300  ) of the ch transition made it inaccessible in the case of cygnus ob 12 ( which is very heavily reddened ) , but it may be possible to detect the line with a larger telescope such as the hobby - eberly telescope .",
    "the line parameters of ch ( as well as ch@xmath6 and cn ) are listed in table [ vistable ] .",
    "the ch column densities have been derived using the curve of growth of @xcite , assuming @xmath33=1 km / s .",

    "one would then predict n(ch ) @xmath69 , roughly twice the observed value .",
    "for cygnus ob2 5 , with e(b - v ) = 2.1 , we estimate n(h@xmath3 ) @xmath70 and therefore n(ch ) @xmath71 @xmath35 , over three times the observed value . assuming our choice of @xmath33-value is not too large",
    ", this suggests that these two sources may be somewhat different chemically from the usual diffuse cloud sources used to develop the empirical relation .",
    "however , this discrepancy may not indicate a drastic departure in chemical conditions , as other sources with lower color excess have been observed with similar departures from the empirical relations @xcite .",
    "the ch discrepancy can be reduced by adopting a lower value of @xmath72 , but this would decrease @xmath60(h@xmath0 ) , exacerbating the problems discussed in  [ inferred ] .",
    "[ ch ]    another interesting molecule is cn : it is observed ( marginally ) as a doublet in both cygnus ob2 12 ( a - x ) and in cygnus ob2 5 ( a - x and b - x ) .",

    "the r(1 ) line is also detected toward hd 183143 , and the population of the @xmath74 and @xmath75 levels are consistent with the temperature of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that , at least in the case of cygnus ob2 12 ( figure [ cygob212_vel ] ) , the velocity profile of h@xmath0  appears more similar to that of k i than to c@xmath3 , cn , or co. this could be because these three molecules are concentrated in the denser regions of the sightline , whereas h@xmath0  ( and k i ) may exist over a larger path length .",
    "the formation of h@xmath0 , in dense or diffuse clouds , begins with the ( cosmic ray induced ) ionization of h@xmath3 to form h@xmath76 .",
    "the generally assumed rate of ionization is @xmath77 s@xmath78 , so that the average h@xmath3 gets ionized roughly once every 10@xmath79 years .",
    "once ionized , the h@xmath76 quickly reacts with another h@xmath3 to form h@xmath0  and an h atom .",

    "clearly the initial ionization is the rate - limiting step , so we can say that h@xmath0  is formed at a rate of @xmath5 n(h@xmath3 ) .",
    "the destruction of h@xmath0  is very different in diffuse clouds , compared to dense clouds . in dense clouds , the dominant destruction path is an ion - neutral reaction with co , with a rate constant of @xmath82 @xmath81 s@xmath78 . in diffuse clouds , electrons are very abundant ( due to photoionization of c ) , so dissociative recombination dominates , with a rate constant of @xmath83 @xmath81 s@xmath78 @xcite .    although the electrons produced by photoionization are probably formed at a high temperature ( photons are available at energies up to 13.6 ev , and the ionization potential of c is only 11.3 ev ) , they will be quickly thermalized by collisions with h@xmath3 .",
    "such collisions will occur with a langevin rate constant ( which scales as @xmath84 , where @xmath9 is the reduced mass ) of @xmath85 @xmath81 s@xmath78 ; in a medium with n(h@xmath3 ) = 100 @xmath2 , an electron experiences such a collision about once per day .",
    "the lifetime of the electron is limited by radiative recombination with c@xmath6 ions , which occurs with a rate constant of @xmath86 @xmath81 s@xmath78 @xcite at the low temperatures ( @xmath130 k ) of diffuse clouds . if n(c@xmath6 )",
    "= 10@xmath87 @xmath2 , the average electron lifetime is about 10@xmath88 years .",
    "evidently the electrons will be very quickly thermalized to the kinetic temperatures of the clouds .",
    "the h@xmath0  electron recombination rate constant is then @xmath89 @xmath81 s@xmath78 , and the destruction rate of h@xmath0  can be given as @xmath90 @xmath60(h@xmath0 ) @xmath60(@xmath91 ) .    to calculate the number density of h@xmath0  @xcite",
    ", we make the steady - state approximation that the rates of formation and destruction are equal .",
    "thus , @xmath92 which can be rearranged to give @xmath93    the chemistry of h@xmath0  is unique in the sense that the number density of h@xmath0  is not dependent upon the number density of the cloud , but only on the ratio of the number densities of molecular hydrogen and electrons ( as well as the ratio of two constants @xmath94 ) .",
    "we can further simplify the above equation by considering @xmath72 , the fraction of protons in h@xmath3 , writing @xmath95 = ( f/2 ) n(\\sigma { \\rm h})$ ] . since most electrons are formed from the ionization of carbon , we can also write @xmath96 , where @xmath55 is the fraction of carbon in un - ionized ( neutral or molecular ) form . finally , the gas - phase ratio of carbon atoms to hydrogen atoms is usually defined as @xmath97 . putting this all together , we find @xmath98    adopting the values @xmath99 s@xmath78 , @xmath100",
    "@xmath81 s@xmath78 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 @xcite , we obtain @xmath104    the validity of the steady - state approximation can be checked by comparing the timescale needed to reach steady - state with other relevant timescales .",
    "the timescale needed to achieve steady - state is approximately the steady state number density of h@xmath0  divided by the formation rate , or @xmath105 $ ] , which for n(h@xmath3 ) = 100 @xmath2 is about one year  clearly much shorter than other relevant timescales !",
    "one cloud parameter can be determined from the h@xmath0  observations independent of the chemical model  the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "this is possible because the _ ortho _ ( @xmath12=1 , @xmath13=0 ) and _ para _ ( @xmath12=1 , @xmath13=1 ) levels of h@xmath0  are efficiently thermalized together through proton hop and proton exchange reactions with h@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these reactions occur with the langevin rate constant of @xmath80 @xmath81 s@xmath78 , so that the average h@xmath0  experiences such a reaction about every two months ( assuming @xmath60(h@xmath3 ) = 100 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the lifetime of the average h@xmath0  can be estimated from the dissociative recombination rate @xmath90 and the number density of electrons @xmath106 @xmath2 to be about 4.5 years , considerably longer than the thermalization timescale .",
    "therefore , we can use the boltzmann expression @xmath107 to estimate the kinetic temperature from the observed _ ortho : para _ ratio ( in this equation , the @xmath108 values are the statistical weights ) . for cygnus",
    "ob2 12 , we obtain t=27@xmath1094 k @xcite ; for cygnus ob2 5 , 47@xmath10913 k ; for hd 183143 , 31@xmath1093 k ; for wr 104 , 38@xmath10910 k ; and for the + 48 km / s component of wr 118 , 40@xmath1093 k. [ we can not estimate the _ ortho : para _ ratio for the low velocity component toward wr 118 due to the overlapping of the lines . ]",
    "given our calculated number density of h@xmath0  from the chemical model , we can now estimate the path length of absorption , using the relation @xmath110 .",
    "once the path length has been calculated , we can then estimate the average number density of collision partners along the path length as @xmath111 / l$ ] , where @xmath62(h@xmath3 ) and @xmath62(h ) can be estimated from the color excess and an assumed value of @xmath72 ( 2/3 ) .",
    "the results of this analysis are given in table [ parameters ] .",
    "in most cases , the derived pathlengths are a substantial fraction of the estimated distance to the star , which seems difficult to accept . in addition , the derived average number densities ( for the sources in which h@xmath0  was detected ) are in the range 15 @xmath2 , which seems unreasonably low .",
    "these densities are nearly two orders lower than the densities typically derived from the rotational excitation of c@xmath3 .",
    "in addition , these densities are so low that a substantial fraction of h@xmath3 should be photodissociated , meaning that our value of @xmath112 should be lowered , which would in turn make the h@xmath0  number density even smaller , the path lengths even longer , and the average density even lower .",
    "it seems clear that there is a serious problem with the model , and that @xmath60(h@xmath0 ) must be larger ( probably by at least one order of magnitude ) than we have calculated . in the next subsection ,",
    "we explore possible solutions to this problem .",
    "the equation for the number density of h@xmath0@xmath98 contains five parameters : the h@xmath3 ionization rate ( @xmath5 ) , the dissociative recombination rate ( @xmath90 ) , the fraction of protons in molecular form ( @xmath72 ) , the fraction of carbon atoms that are not ionized ( @xmath55 ) , and the gas phase carbon fraction ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "we now consider each one of these parameters in more detail .",
    "the fraction of protons in molecular form ( @xmath72 ) has been assumed to have the value 2/3 , which is the largest value found in the studies of molecular and atomic hydrogen by copernicus , iue , and fuse .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath72 is 1 , so even making this adjustment ( as is done in the model of @xcite ) will only increase @xmath60(h@xmath0 ) by a factor of 1.5  hardly enough to fix the problem .",
    "in addition , increasing the value of @xmath72 would increase the discrepancy between inferred and measured @xmath62(ch ) , as discussed in  [ ch ] .",
    "the gas phase carbon fraction ( @xmath113 ) has been taken to be @xmath114 based on ultraviolet observations of classical diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "lowering this value ( for instance , by assuming that a larger fraction of the carbon is depleted onto grains ) would reduce the number density of electrons and therefore increase the number density of h@xmath0 . however , there is no astronomical evidence to support the magnitude of depletion necessary to mitigate the h@xmath0  problem .",
    "the fraction of carbon that is not ionized ( @xmath55 ) has been assumed to be near zero .",
    "it is conceivable that a substantial fraction of the carbon could be in the form of neutral c atoms ( rather than c@xmath6 ) , and there is no observational evidence ( in these particular sightlines ) that requires most of the carbon to be ionized .",
    "however , most chemical models of translucent clouds ( see , for example , figure 9 of @xcite ) suggest that when the optical depth has increased to the point where @xmath60(c)=@xmath60(c@xmath6 ) , over 10% of the carbon atoms are already in the form of co. taken along with our observations of a low column density of co in these sightlines , this suggests that @xmath55 must be less than 0.5 , and thus could contribute at most a factor of 2 towards increasing the h@xmath0  number density .    however , other models ( e.g.  @xcite ) suggest that the abundance of c@xmath6 in an @xmath115 cloud may be 15 times lower than in an @xmath116 cloud .",
    "if we adopt this model , then it is possible that @xmath117 , which would increase @xmath60(h@xmath0 ) by one order of magnitude",
    ". given the differences between the models , we hesitate to rely on them too much , in the absence of observational evidence .",
    "the best determination of the value of @xmath55 would come from an observation of the c@xmath6 transitions at 1334 and 2325   using the hubble space telescope .    along the same lines",
    ", one might speculate about the possibility of an `` electron sink '' in these sightlines , so that c could still be ionized but the free electron abundance would be low .",
    "the best candidate mechanism for removing electrons from the gas is probably attachment to grains or large molecules ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , because the number density of large molecules or grains is orders of magnitude lower than the number density of electrons ( since these molecules or grains form from elements with cosmic abundance less than or equal to that of carbon , and each molecule or grain contains many atoms ) , this process could not effect the removal of a significant fraction of the electrons from the gas phase .",
    "the h@xmath3 ionization rate ( @xmath5 ) has been assumed to be @xmath118 s@xmath78 , but this value is not terribly well constrained . @xcite",
    "assume @xmath119 in order to increase the h@xmath0  number density , and values as high as @xmath120 have been derived from analysis of the chemistry leading to oh in diffuse clouds @xcite . while the flux of high energy ( @xmath121 100 mev ) cosmic rays can be constrained by observations in the interplanetary medium ,",
    "the flux of lower energy cosmic rays is essentially unconstrained , due to the influence of the sun .",
    "if the cosmic ray spectrum is assumed not to roll off too rapidly below 100 mev , it is conceivable that @xmath5 might be as high as @xmath122 s@xmath78 @xcite .",
    "a large flux of low energy cosmic rays might increase the h@xmath0  number density in diffuse clouds while not seriously affecting the situation in dense clouds , into which the low energy cosmic rays could not penetrate .",
    "other sources of h@xmath3 ionization have also been suggested .",
    "@xcite has suggested that x - rays from the luminous stars in the cygnus ob2 association could increase the effective @xmath5 and therefore @xmath60(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "while this suggestion might solve the problem for the sightlines toward cygnus ob2 , our observations of high @xmath62(h@xmath0 ) toward several other sources imply that a more general solution is needed .",
    "@xcite has also suggested that ultraviolet photoionization of h@xmath3 might contribute .",
    "however , photoionization of h@xmath3 requires photons with energies above 15.4 ev , which will ionize h atoms .",
    "while black suggests that such photons could escape the h ii region near the cygnus ob2 giants , it seems unlikely that they could penetrate the boundaries of diffuse clouds , where h atoms are abundant .",
    "furthermore , our new detections of h@xmath0  again suggest that the sightlines toward the cygnus ob2 association are not unique .",
    "the last parameter in the equation for the h@xmath0  number density is the dissociative recombination rate ( @xmath90 ) . in this work ,",
    "we have adopted the value of @xmath83 @xmath81 s@xmath78 derived from storage ring experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the value of this constant has been the matter of great controversy over the past two decades  other experimental techniques currently yield a value of @xmath90 that is about one order of magnitude lower ( for a review of the field , see @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the discrepancy might be due to stray fields present in the storage ring experiments , and that the recombination rate under interstellar conditions could be quite low . to make matters worse , attempts to theoretically calculate the recombination rate yield rates more than an order of magnitude smaller than the smallest values obtained in experiments @xcite , but it should be noted that the theory of this recombination process is not yet mature .",
    "given the present uncertainty in the true value of @xmath90 , it is possible that the problem of diffuse cloud h@xmath0  may be solved on this front .",
    "the resolution of the mystery of diffuse cloud h@xmath0  will most likely come from further observational work .",
    "first we must determine with certainty whether the unexpectedly high number density of h@xmath0  is a `` local '' problem ( i.e. , due to special conditions in these particular sightlines , or this class of sightlines ) , or if it is a `` global '' problem .",
    "the present observational situation is summarized in figure [ eb_v ] , which plots the observed h@xmath0  column density ( or the upper limit , denoted by a bar to zero ) versus the color excess e(b - v ) .",
    "in addition to the present observations , the detection of h@xmath0  toward the galactic center source gc irs 3 @xcite has been added ( the h@xmath0  column density plotted is that of the narrow component attributed to diffuse clouds by @xcite , and the adopted color excess is that attributed to diffuse clouds by @xcite ) . keeping in mind that @xmath123 the plot is not inconsistent with a constant @xmath60(h@xmath0 ) and small variations ( of a factor of a few ) in the average density @xmath124 . therefore at this stage there is no strong evidence that the `` local '' parameters ( @xmath72 , @xmath55 , and @xmath113 ) are any different in the detection sources than they are in the non - detections such as @xmath5 oph .",
    "however , this inference needs to be tested directly by observations .",
    "this can be achieved by detecting h@xmath0  along a line of sight with lower e(b - v ) which can be studied by fuse and hst .",
    "once the column densities of h@xmath0 , h i , h@xmath3 , c i , c ii , co , and ch are obtained for a single sightline , the influence of the `` local '' parameters will be directly determined .    assuming that these parameters are found to have their canonical values , we will be left with the ratio @xmath125 .",
    "absent a speedy resolution from the experimenters or theorists in the field of dissociative recombination , further insight into these two constants can perhaps best be obtained through an observational survey of h@xmath0  in more heavily reddened lines of sight .",
    "the rate of h@xmath0  destruction is controlled by @xmath126 ( which depends on the optical depth in the ultraviolet ) , whereas the rate of h@xmath0  formation is controlled by @xmath5 ( which , with a given incident cosmic ray spectrum , depends on the stopping power of the cloud as a function of cosmic ray energy ) .",
    "therefore , a detailed study of the diffuse - to - dense cloud transition , along with chemical models , could help constrain the values of @xmath5 and @xmath90 .",
    "the highly - reddened , early - type subset of the stephenson catalog recently compiled by @xcite may serve as a good starting point for such a study .",
    "the h@xmath0  molecular ion has now been definitely detected in seven diffuse cloud lines of sight , suggesting that its unexpectedly high abundance is not due to the peculiarities of a particular region ( the cygnus ob2 association ) , but rather a general feature of the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "h@xmath0  is observed in clouds with and without co , c@xmath3 , and cn , confirming that the chemistry that leads to h@xmath0  is completely decoupled from that which is responsible for these heavier diatomics .",
    "the most likely explanation for the high h@xmath0  abundance is a larger than expected @xmath125 ratio  due either to a larger flux of low - energy cosmic rays or to a lower value of @xmath90 in interstellar conditions .",
    "the possibility of a lower than expected electron density has not been ruled out , and should be directly tested by finding h@xmath0  in a less reddened source .",
