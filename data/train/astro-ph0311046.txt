    "dama is an observatory for rare processes based on the development and use of various kinds of radiopure scintillators .",
    "several low background set - ups have been realised ; the main ones are : i ) dama / nai ( @xmath0 100 kg of radiopure nai(tl ) ) , which took data underground over seven annual cycles and was put out of operation in july 2002 ; ii ) dama / lxe ( @xmath0 6.5 kg liquid xenon ) , which has been upgraded various times and is in operation ; iii ) dama / r&d , which is a set - up devoted to measurements on prototypes / small  scale  experiments and is in operation ; iv ) the new second generation set - up dama / libra ( @xmath0 250 kg ; more radiopure nai(tl ) ) in operation since march 2003 . moreover , in the framework of devoted r&d for higher radiopure detectors and pmts , sample measurements are regularly carried out by means of the low background dama / ge detector , installed deep underground since @xmath4 10 years and , in some cases , by means of ispra facilities .",
    "recent results from dama / lxe are presented in these proceedings elsewhere @xcite , while in ref .",
    "@xcite some recent results achieved with dama / r&d can be found .",
    "the dama / nai set - up and its performances have been described in details in ref .",
    "since then some upgrading has been carried out ; in particular , in summer 2000 the electronic chain and data acquisition system were completely substituted as reported in ref . @xcite .    as mentioned , dama / nai has taken data over seven annual cycles up to july 2002 @xcite .",
    "the first data release and publication of dama / nai data occurred in 1996 @xcite for an exposure of 4123 kg @xmath1 day ( dama / nai-0 ) analysed by using the pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) technique in nai(tl ) in order to discriminate between electromagnetic background and recoils .",
    "investigation of possible diurnal effects has been carried out as well @xcite .",
    "the main aim of the experiment was actually the investigation of the presence of a dark matter particle component in the galactic halo by means of the model independent wimp annual modulation signature , which has been deeply investigated over seven annual cycles ( 107731 kg @xmath1 day total exposure ) .",
    "dama / nai has also obtained results on the investigation of some exotic dark matter candidates ( such as neutral simps , neutral nuclearities and q - balls ) @xcite , has searched for solar axions @xcite and has given results on several other rare processes such as e.g. spontaneous emission of protons in @xmath5na and @xmath6i with violation of the pauli exclusion principle @xcite , nuclear level excitation of @xmath5na and @xmath6i during charge - non - conserving processes @xcite , electron stability and non - paulian transitions in iodine atoms by l - shell@xcite .    in the following",
    ", the result obtained by dama / nai in the investigation of the wimp annual modulation signature over the seven annual cycles will be briefly summarised .",
    "this cumulative 107731 kg @xmath1 day exposure has given a model independent evidence for the presence of a dark matter particle component in the galactic halo at 6.3 @xmath2 c.l . ; this main result and corollary interpretations in some of the possible different model scenarios have been discussed in experimental and theoretical details in ref .",
    "@xcite and have firstly been presented after this conference in a seminar at gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) at end of july 2003 .    the new second generation larger mass and higher radiopure nai(tl ) set - up , named dama / libra , is now in operation and will be briefly introduced .",
    "the dama / nai experiment has been built in order to have suitable mass , sensitivity and control of the running conditions to investigate the wimp presence in the galactic halo by the annual modulation signature .",
    "we remind that the wimp annual modulation signature is based on the annual modulation of the signal rate induced by the earth revolution around the sun ; as a consequence , the earth will be crossed by a larger wimp flux roughly in june ( when its rotational velocity is summed to the one of the solar system with respect to the galaxy ) and by a smaller one roughly in december ( when the two velocities are subtracted ) .",
    "the annual modulation signature is very distinctive since a wimp - induced seasonal effect must simultaneously satisfy all the following requirements : the rate must contain a component modulated according to a cosine function ( 1 ) with one year period , @xmath7 , ( 2 ) and a phase , @xmath8 , that peaks around @xmath0 2@xmath9 june ( 3 ) ; this modulation must only be found in a well - defined low energy range , where wimp induced recoils can be present ( 4 ) ; it must apply to those events in which just one detector of many actually `` fires '' ( _ single - hit _ events ) , since the wimp multi - scattering probability is negligible ( 5 ) ; the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity is expected to be @xmath107@xmath11 ( 6 ) . for the sake of completeness , we mention that this latter rough limit would be larger either in case the wimps would match the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite ( because of kinematic effects ) or the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite ( because of a possible external contribution to the dark halo from the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream ) . to mimic such",
    "a signature spurious effects or side reactions should not only be able to account for the whole observed modulation amplitude , but also to contemporaneously satisfy all the requirements ; no one has been found or suggested by anyone over about a decade .    as mentioned , to point out the modulation component of a signal , large mass apparata with suitable performances and control of the operating conditions are necessary , such as the @xmath0 100 kg highly radiopure nai(tl ) dama / nai set - up  which has been the only experiment able to effectively exploit such a wimp signature for about a decade  and now the @xmath0 250 kg higher radiopure nai(tl ) dama / libra set - up .",
    "this approach allows to investigate the presence of a dark matter particle component in the galactic halo independently on astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics modelling .",
    "corollary quests for the candidate particle require instead to choose a model ; therefore , the results are not general and refer case by case to the considered model framework as it is always the case for results given in form of exclusion plots ( which , thus , have no generality ) and for the specific parameters of a wimp candidate ( mass and cross sections ) derived from the indirect searches ( for some discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of a model independent positive evidence in the data of dama / nai has been firstly reported by the dama collaboration at the taup conference in 1997 @xcite and published also in @xcite , confirmed in @xcite , further confirmed in @xcite and conclusively confirmed , at end of experiment , in 2003 @xcite .",
    "corollary model dependent quests for a candidate particle have been carried out in some of the many possible model frameworks and have been improved with time . in particular ,",

    "it is model independent ; no other experiment whose result can be directly compared with this one is available so far in the field of dark matter investigation .",
    "on the basis of the obtained model independent result , corollary investigations can also be pursued on the nature and coupling of the wimp candidate .",
    "this latter investigation is instead model dependent and  considering the large uncertainties which exist on the astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics assumptions and on the parameters needed in the calculations  has no general meaning ( as it is also the case  as mentioned above  of exclusion plots and of the wimp parameters evaluated in indirect search experiments ) .",
    "thus , it should be handled in the most general way as we have preliminarily pointed out with time in the past @xcite and we have discussed in some specific details in ref .",
    "@xcite ; other efforts on this topic are also in progress .",
    "candidates , kinds of wimp couplings with ordinary matter and implications , cross sections , nuclear form factors , spin factors , scaling laws , halo models , priors , etc . are discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite and we invite the reader to this reference since these arguments are necessary to correctly understand the results obtained in corollary quests and the real validity of any claimed model dependent comparison in the field .",
    "the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and summarised here are , of course , not exhaustive of the many possible scenarios which at present level of knowledge can not be disentangled .",
    "some of the open questions are : i ) which is the right nature for the wimp particle ; family ( there is still room for it as reported in literature ) , the sneutrino in the scenario described by @xcite ( providing  through the transition from lower to upper mass eigenstate  _ preferred inelastic _ scattering with target - nuclei ) , the `` mirror '' dark matter @xcite , etc .. moreover , in principle whatever weakly interacting , neutral , ( quasi-)stable and massive ( whose acronym is wimp ) particle , even not yet foreseen by a theory , can be a suitable candidate . as regards in particular the neutralino",
    ", we note that the theories have not stringent predictive capability for its cross sections and for its mass because of the large number of free parameters in the theory and of the several assumptions required ; thus , e.g. the expectations for its nuclear cross sections span over several orders of magnitude as it can also be seen in literature .",
    "in addition , we take this occasion to remind that the neutralino has both si and sd couplings with the ordinary matter . ]",
    "ii ) which is its right couplings with ordinary matter ( mixed si&sd , purely si , purely sd or _ preferred inelastic _ )",
    "iii ) which are the right form factors and related parameters for each target nucleus ; iv ) which is the right spin factor for each target nucleus ( some nuclei are disfavoured to some kinds of interactions ; for example , in case of an interaction with sd component even a nucleus sensitive in principle to sd interaction could be blinded by the spin factor if unfavoured by the @xmath31 value is the ratio between the wimp - neutron and the wimp - proton effective sd coupling strengths , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively @xcite ; @xmath31 is defined in the [ 0,@xmath34 ) interval . ] ) ; v ) which are the right scaling laws ( let us consider as an example that even in a mssm framework with purely si interaction the scenario could be drastically modified as discussed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; vi ) which is the right halo model and related parameters ; vii ) which are the right values of the experimental parameters within their uncertainties ; etc . as an example",
    ", we remind that not only large differences in the measured rate can be expected when using target nuclei sensitive to the sd component of the interaction ( such as e.g. @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) with respect to those largely insensitive to such a coupling ( such as e.g. @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) , but also when using different target nuclei although all  in principle  sensitive to such a coupling ( compare e.g. the xenon and tellurium cases with the sodium and iodine cases ) @xcite .    in the following some of the results discussed for some of the many possible model dependent quests for a wimp candidate",
    "are briefly reminded @xcite . in particular ,",
    "they have been obtained from the data collected during all the seven annual cycles , considering the halo models summarized in @xcite for three of the possible values of the local velocity @xmath39 : 170 km / s , 220 km / s and 270 km / s .",
    "the escape velocity has been maintained at the fixed value : 650 km / s .",
    "it is worth to note that the present existing uncertainties on the knowledge of the escape velocity can play a relevant role in evaluating allowed regions ( and corresponding best fit values for wimp mass and cross section ) e.g. in the cases of _ preferred inelastic _ wimps and of light mass wimp candidates ; its effect would be instead marginal at large wimp masses .",
    "the possible scenarios have been exploited for those halo models in some discrete cases including some of the uncertainties which exist in the parameters of the used nuclear form factors and in the quenching factors ; for the details see ref .",
    "the results summarised here are not exhaustive of the many scenarios possible at present level of knowledge : e.g. for some other recent ideas see the already quoted @xcite .    for simplicity , here",
    "the results of these corollary quests for a candidate particle are presented in terms of allowed regions obtained as superposition of the configurations corresponding to likelihood function values _",
    "distant _ more than @xmath40 from the null hypothesis ( absence of modulation ) in each of the several ( but still a limited number ) of the possible model frameworks considered here . obviously ,",
    "larger sensitivities than those reported in the following figures would be reached when including the effect of other existing uncertainties on the astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics assumptions and related parameters ; similarly , the set of the best fit values would also be enlarged as well .",
    "as well known , dama / nai is intrinsically sensitive both to low and high wimp mass having both a light ( the @xmath5na ) and a heavy ( the @xmath6i ) target - nucleus ; in previous corollary quests wimp masses above 30 gev ( 25 gev in ref .",
    "@xcite ) have been presented @xcite for few ( of the many possible ) model frameworks .",
    "however , that bound holds only for neutralino when supersymmetric schemes based on gut assumptions are adopted to analyse the lep data @xcite .",
    "thus , since other candidates are possible and also other scenarios can be considered for the neutralino itself as recently pointed out , 6 gev are allowed @xcite . ]",
    "the present model dependent lower bound quoted by lep for the neutralino in the supersymmetric schemes based on gut assumptions ( 37 gev @xcite ) is simply marked in the following figures .",
    "it is worth to note that when this mass limit is adopted , it selects the wimp - iodine elastic scattering as dominant because of the used scaling laws and of kinematical arguments .",
    "finally , the prior from dama / nai-0 has properly been considered as well .    * wimps with mixed si&sd interaction . *",
    "the most general scenario of wimp nucleus elastic interaction , to which the dama / nai target nuclei are fully sensitive , is the one where both the si and the sd components of the cross section     vs @xmath41 for some of the possible @xmath42 and @xmath31 values .",
    "inclusion of other existing uncertainties on parameters and models would further extend the regions ; for example , the use of more favourable form factors and/or of more favourable spin factors than the considered ones would move them towards lower cross sections . for details see @xcite.,height=340 ]    are present .",
    "thus , as first we introduce here the case for a candidate with both si and sd couplings to ordinary matter @xcite similarly as we did in the past also in ref .",
    "@xcite on partial exposure . in this general scenario",
    "the space of the free parameters is a 4-dimensional volume defined by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , ( @xmath44 ) is defined here as the fractional amount of local wimp density . ]",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath31 ( which varies from 0 to @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , the general solution would be a four dimensional allowed volume for each considered model framework . since the graphic representation of this allowed volume is quite difficult , we only show in fig .",
    "[ fg : pan_sisd ] the obtained regions in the plane @xmath43 vs @xmath41 for some of the possible @xmath31 and @xmath42 values in the model frameworks considered here . in particular , we report just four couplings , which correspond to the following values of the mixing angle @xmath31 : i ) @xmath31 = 0 ( @xmath32 = 0 and @xmath45 0 or @xmath46 ) corresponding to a particle with null sd coupling to neutron ; ii ) @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) corresponding to a particle with the same sd coupling to neutron and proton ; iii ) @xmath31 = @xmath49 ( @xmath50 0 and @xmath33 = 0 or @xmath51 ) corresponding to a particle with null sd couplings to proton ; iv ) @xmath31 = 2.435 rad ( @xmath52 = -0.85 ) corresponding to a particle with sd coupling through @xmath53 exchange .",
    "the case @xmath54 is nearly similar to the case iv ) .    from the given figures it is clear that at present either a purely si or a purely sd or a mixed si&sd configurations are supported by the experimental data of the seven annual cycles .",
    "* wimps with dominant si interaction . *",
    "generally , the case of purely si coupled wimp is mainly considered in literature .",
    "in fact , often the spin - independent interaction with ordinary matter is assumed to be dominant since e.g. most of the used target - nuclei are practically not sensitive to sd interactions ( as on the contrary @xmath5na and @xmath6i are ) and the theoretical calculations are even much more complex and uncertain .",

    "other model dependent quests are already under consideration .",
    "in 1996 a ton set - up was proposed by bernabei et al . ; as a consequence a new r&d for nai(tl ) radiopurification has been carried out and the second generation set - up dama / libra ( @xmath0250 kg nai(tl ) ) has been funded and realised as an intermediate step .",

    "gobain company has exploited for the first time new chemical / physical radiopurification procedures in nai and tli powders already selected for radiopurity .",
    "in addition , new selected materials and set - up components as well as new protocols have been employed for building dama / libra .    in 2002 ended the production of detectors and of new parts of the installation for dama / libra .",
    "thus , after july 2002  at the completion of its data taking ",
    "dama / nai was fully dismounted and the installation of the new dama / libra started .",
    "the experimental site as well as many components of the installation itself were implemented ( environment , shield of pmts , wiring , hp nitrogen system , cooling water of air conditioner , electronics and daq , etc ... ) . before the installation ,",
    "all the cu parts were chemically etched following a devoted protocol and maintained in hp nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "in addition , all the procedures performed during the dismounting of dama / nai and the installation of dama / libra were carried out in hp nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "this was realised by using a scuba system ( a self - contained underwater breathing apparatus ) modified in order to avoid that the entire breath is expelled into the surrounding air when the operator exhales ; the air cylinders were kept five meters away and the output line was two meters long .    -0.8",
    "cm   -0.1 cm    -0.5 cm [ fg : mezzaluna ]    the new dama / libra , having an exposed mass of @xmath72 kg , an higher overall radiopurity and improved performances , offers an increased experimental sensitivity to further investigate the dama / nai observed effect and to improve investigations on the nature of the candidate particle trying to disentangle among different possible astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics models as well as other new possible scenarios .",
    "see just as an example of new ideas the case of the _ mirror _ dark matter @xcite , the case of a contribution to the dark halo from the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream @xcite , the case of possible different nuclear scaling laws even for the neutralino candidate in mssm @xcite , etc .. moreover , the low background dama / libra offers a powerful tool for the dark matter investigation in the future since it is e.g. sensitive : i ) both to low ( through interaction on @xmath5na ) and to high ( through interaction on @xmath6i ) mass dark matter particles ; ii ) both to mixed si&sd , to purely si , to purely sd couplings and to _ preferred inelastic _ scattering as well as to other possible kind of dark matter candidates ( e.g. _ mirror _ dark matter ) .",

    "set - up has been funded and related works have already been started .",
    "dama / nai has been a pioneer experiment running at lngs for about a decade and investigating as first the wimp annual modulation signature with suitable exposed mass , sensitivity and control of the running parameters . during seven independent experiments of one year each one , it has pointed out the presence of a modulation satisfying the many peculiarities of a wimp induced effect , reaching an evidence at 6.3 @xmath2 c.l ..",
    "no other experiment has so far been in position to give a result directly comparable in a model independent way with that of dama / nai . as a corollary ,",
    "it has also pointed out the complexity of the quest for a wimp candidate because of the present poor knowledge on the many astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics aspects .",
    "after the completion , on july 2002 , of the dama / nai data taking , the second generation dama / libra set - up ( @xmath0 250 kg mass ) has been installed and preliminarily put in operation , as a result of continuous efforts by the dama collaboration toward the creation of ultimate radiopure nai(tl ) .",
    "dama / libra , having a larger exposed mass and an higher overall radiopurity , will significantly contribute in the incoming years to the further understanding of the field .",
