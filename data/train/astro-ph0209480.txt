    "the `` mouse '' ( 0.82 @xcite ; g359.23@xmath100.92 @xcite ; g359.2@xmath1000.8 ( simbad database ) . in accordance with iau rules",

    "[ fig : mouse ] ) , consisting of a bright `` head '' and a long `` tail '' that is highly linearly polarized . it is also an x - ray source @xcite .",
    "the few other examples known in this class are manifestations of a pulsar bow shock : the relativistic wind of a neutron star confined by ram pressure due to the supersonic motion of the pulsar through the local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the detailed study of such objects can lead to constraints on the local ism density and pulsar velocities , ages , spin and magnetic field evolution , and winds @xcite , as exemplified by the study of the `` duck '' nebula and its pulsar @xcite .",
    "also , relatively few young nearby pulsars are known .",
    "detecting other such nearby pulsars , as is likely to be lurking inside the mouse , is important for accurately determining pulsar birth rates , beaming fractions and luminosity distributions ( e.g. , brazier & johnston 1999 ) .",
    "the mouse has therefore been the object of considerable interest since its discovery .",
    "while its interpretation as a pulsar - powered nebula is appealing @xcite , no central engine had been detected in previous radio pulsation searches . in this letter",
    "we report the discovery of a faint young pulsar coincident with the mouse s head , confirming that the mouse is a synchrotron nebula powered by a high velocity neutron star .",
    "the most sensitive previous pulsar search at the position of  was the parkes multibeam pulsar survey of the inner galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the mouse is only one degree away from the galactic center , where background synchrotron emission degrades considerably the system sensitivity , and we estimate that the flux density limit at the position of  was no better than 0.6mjy at a frequency of 1374mhz . following the recent discovery at parkes of the very faint pulsar j1124@xmath105916 located in the supernova remnant ( snr ) g292.0 + 1.8 @xcite , we began the deepest searches possible at parkes of a number of good young pulsar candidates , including the mouse .",
    "on 2002 february 1 we searched the head of the mouse using the center beam of the multibeam receiver at a central frequency of 1374mhz .",
    "the observing setup was identical to that used in the discovery of psr  j1124@xmath105916 , with total - power signals from 96 frequency channels , spanning a total band of 288mhz for each of two polarizations , sampled at 1ms intervals and recorded to magnetic tape for off - line analysis .",
    "the total observation time was 9.4hr .",
    "the data were reduced in standard fashion using an fft - based code ( see lorimer et al .",
    "2000 for details ) to search for periodic signals in de - dispersed time series with trial dispersion measures ( dms ) in the range 08800@xmath2pc . for further details , see camilo et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "a clear periodic and dispersed signal with period @xmath11ms was detected with maximum signal - to - noise ratio of 15.1 at @xmath12@xmath2pc .",
    "we confirmed the pulsar with a 3hr observation on february 3 and thereafter began similar regular timing observations , thus far having obtained 17 times - of - arrival ( toas ) spanning 6 months .",
    "we have used the tempo timing software and the toas to derive the ephemeris listed in table  [ tab : parms ] . based on the coordinates of this pulsar ,",
    "we designate it as .",
    "the observed flux density of the pulsar is somewhat variable , in a manner consistent with interstellar scintillation .",
    "we formed a mean pulse profile , shown in figure  [ fig : prof ] , by averaging all available observations .",
    "this shows that the pulsed emission covers about 50% of the pulse period , rising slowly to the peak and falling sharply after it .",
    "this profile was calibrated ( for details , see manchester et al .",
    "2001 ) , taking into account the measured sky brightness temperature at the mouse position ( 18k ) , to derive a flux density of @xmath13mjy .",
    "the radio luminosity @xmath14 for a distance @xmath15kpc ( see   [ sec : disc ] ) is @xmath16mjykpc@xmath9 .",
    "this is a very low value , but is similar to those of four young and energetic pulsars discovered recently ( halpern et al .",
    "2001 ; camilo et al .",
    "2002a  c ) , highlighting that such pulsars can be very faint radio sources .    on 2002",
    "may 15 we attempted , unsuccessfully , to measure the position of the pulsar independent of pulsar timing by performing pulsar - gated radio imaging with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "we observed the field of the mouse in the 6a array configuration simultaneously with two @xmath17-mhz bandwidths centered at frequencies of 1.4 and 1.7ghz for an effective on - source integration time of about 11hr .",
    "pks  1934@xmath10638 was the primary flux density calibrator and pks  1748@xmath10253 was the secondary phase calibrator .",
    "while pointing at , data for each baseline were integrated into 32 pulse phase bins coherently with the topocentric period of the pulsar .",
    "we also made a number of 5min integrations on a strong pulsar , psr  b1641@xmath1045 .",
    "the data were analyzed in standard fashion with the miriad software ( see , e.g. , stappers , gaensler , & johnston 1999 ) eventually yielding `` on - pulse @xmath10 off - pulse '' images . while psr  b1641@xmath1045 was detected easily ,  was not , with an upper limit on the flux density averaged over @xmath18 of the period of about 2mjy .",
    "this is comparable to the expected peak flux density of the pulsar .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mouse ] we display two radio images of the mouse . in the left panel",
    "we show a @xmath19 field taken from the most galactic center survey ( mgcs ; gray 1994 ) , with the field - of - view of our parkes observation overlaid . in the right panel",
    "we show a higher resolution image of the head of the mouse , expanded by a factor of 30 with respect to the left panel .",
    "this was obtained from an observation with the very large array ( vla ) in its a configuration on 1999 october 8 at a frequency of 8.4ghz , using a bandwidth of 100mhz with an on - source integration time of 3hr , and analyzed in standard fashion .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 measured for  imply a relatively large spin - down luminosity @xmath22ergs@xmath5 ( where the neutron star moment of inertia @xmath23gcm@xmath9 ) , small characteristic age @xmath25kyr , and surface magnetic dipole field strength @xmath26 g .",
    "these parameters place  in the group of @xmath27 `` vela - like '' pulsars now known ( those with @xmath28ergs@xmath5 and @xmath29kyr ) . in the remainder of this section",
    "we discuss the evidence linking  with the mouse .    with the present positional accuracy ( table  [ tab : parms ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mouse ] ) , the offset between the pulsar s timing position and that of the head of the mouse seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mouse ] is @xmath30 , and the area of the error ellipse is @xmath31 . with approximately 1000 pulsars known in an area @xmath32 along the inner galactic plane ( @xmath33 ; @xmath34 ) , the probability of finding one by chance this close to the mouse s head is about @xmath35 .",
    "we therefore regard the positional match of both sources as highly suggestive of an association .",
    "eventually a more precise position for the pulsar will be obtained from timing , and possibly from  observations .",
    "we now consider distance indicators .",
    "the measured dm , together with the cordes & lazio ( 2002 ) model for the galactic distribution of free electrons , implies a pulsar distance of 2kpc ( the older model of taylor & cordes 1993 yields @xmath36kpc ) .",
    "the distance to the mouse has been investigated using hi absorption measurements .",
    "owing to the lack of absorption against a ring located 3kpc from the galactic center , uchida et al .",
    "( 1992 ) infer that the mouse is located at @xmath37kpc from the sun .",
    "this is consistent with the pulsar distance determination , and hereafter we consider both objects to be located at @xmath6kpc and parametrize the distance in terms of @xmath38kpc .",
    "the head of the mouse has been detected in x - rays , although with limited statistics @xcite and angular resolution @xcite .",
    "sidoli et al .",
    "model the source with a power - law spectrum having unabsorbed 210kev flux @xmath39erg@xmath40s@xmath5 . assuming this flux to be isotropic implies a luminosity @xmath41ergs@xmath5 , or an efficiency for conversion of spin - down luminosity into x - ray emission of @xmath42 .",
    "this is apparently a factor of @xmath43 larger than the comparable efficiency in the psr  b1757@xmath1024/duck pulsar wind nebula @xcite , a system displaying a bow - shock morphology @xcite and seeming in many respects similar to the mouse/ , including a pulsar with comparable spin parameters .",
    "only x - ray observations with higher sensitivity and resolution will settle the issue , but the presently available data do indicate that the x - ray emission observed from the direction of the mouse s head is certainly compatible with an origin in this system , located at a distance of @xmath6kpc .",
    "given the positional coincidence , consistency in distance indicators , and energetics compatible with a common source , we regard the /mouse association as secure .",
    "the morphology of the mouse ( bright head , coincident with , trailed to the west by a @xmath44-long cometary tail ; fig .",
    "[ fig : mouse ] ) suggests fast motion of the pulsar through the ambient ism . the tail ( length @xmath45pc ) presumably results from synchrotron radiation produced by the pulsar relativistic wind in the nebular magnetic field .",
    "for a typical field of tens of @xmath46 g , the lifetime of the radiating particles is @xmath47yr .",
    "the non - thermal spectrum steepens away from the pulsar location likely due to synchrotron losses @xcite .",
    "much can be learned about the pulsar and the local ism through a detailed study of the mouse s head and tail , as we now outline .",
    "as the pulsar moves supersonically through the ambient medium producing a bow shock , the morphology of the mouse s head is expected to be shaped by ram - pressure balance between the pulsar relativistic wind and the local ism . in particular ,",
    "the standoff radius of the shock , @xmath48 , for a neutron star moving with velocity @xmath49 through a medium of density @xmath50 , is determined from @xmath51 ( see , e.g. , chatterjee & cordes 2002 ) .",
    "we assume that the pulsar wind is radiated isotropically , and hereafter neglect projection effects .",
    "we have not measured the standoff angle @xmath52 , but infer a crude estimate from figure  [ fig : mouse ] as follows .",
    "the width of the mouse s head in the presumed direction of motion ( west to east ) is about @xmath53 .",
    "it is likely that the pulsar lies within this region of intense synchrotron emission and that the apex of the bow shock lies just outside @xcite .",
    "thus we estimate @xmath54 , parametrized as @xmath55 . with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the medium s number density , @xmath58 is the mass of the h atom , and the numerical factor derives from assuming a cosmic abundance of he in the ism @xcite , we obtain @xmath59kms@xmath5 , where we have used the @xmath60 measured for . for a reasonable pulsar velocity ( @xmath61kms@xmath5 ;",
    "e.g. , lyne & lorimer 1994 ) , this implies an ism of high density , @xmath62@xmath2 . in turn",
    "this suggests that the pulsar is moving ( rapidly ) through a warm or cold phase of the ism ( e.g. , heiles 2001 ) , with attendant small sound speed @xmath63 , and hence that its mach number should be high , @xmath64 .",
    "we now extend our attention to the mouse s tail .",
    "we can obtain a crude estimate of the pulsar s age @xmath65 by considering that it has traveled the observed length of the tail in its lifetime , @xmath66kyr , where @xmath67kms@xmath5 .",
    "the age may differ significantly from this if only part of the tail has been detected or if the tail is instead caused by a relatively recent pulsar backflow ( e.g. , kaspi et al .",
    "the actual age compares to the pulsar characteristic age of @xmath68kyr .",
    "these are related by @xmath69/(n-1)$ ] under the assumption of constant magnetic moment , where @xmath70 is the initial period and @xmath57 is the braking index of rotation @xcite .",
    "a number of factors may cause @xmath65 to be larger , or smaller , than @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 , and @xmath73 , appropriate to magnetic dipole braking , are usually assumed .",
    "however for some pulsars @xmath74 ( mereghetti et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "also , @xmath70 may be large , up to perhaps @xmath75ms ( e.g. , camilo et al .",
    "in light of these issues , we regard the pulsar s characteristic age as approximately consistent with that inferred from the length of the tail , confirming this source as a relatively young pulsar .    in summary , while it appears that the nature of the source powering the mouse has finally been uncovered with the discovery of , much remains to be understood about this fascinating object , requiring further observational efforts .",
    "a key measurement to be made is the proper motion of the pulsar , @xmath76masyr@xmath5 .",
    "this may be possible through  observations and , depending on the amount of `` timing noise ''",
    "present in the neutron star , via radio timing .",
    "the pulsar  bow - shock standoff distance is also of great interest .",
    "finally , further study of the mouse s tail , independent characterization of the local ism , and any improvement to the distance estimate , would be most useful .",
