    "the purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a new method of solving the tremaine - weinberg equations ( tremaine & weinberg 1984 , hereafter tw84 ) for a pattern speed , @xmath2 , that is allowed to vary with radius .",
    "the pattern speed is an important astrophysical parameter for understanding the role of spiral and bar structures in the formation , dynamics , and evolution of a galaxy .",
    "its radial behavior is not well understood .",
    "the method is capable of checking fundamental assumptions in the density - wave interpretation of spiral structure that are often used for measuring @xmath2 .",
    "this interpretation assumes that @xmath2 is constant ( i.e. , independent of radius ) , and that resonant radii are identifiable on a rotation curve of the galaxy ( see bertin & lin 1996 ; bertin 2000 ) .",
    "resonant radii are assumed to occur when @xmath2 = @xmath3 , the material speed , and when @xmath2 @xmath4 @xmath3 @xmath5 @xmath6/@xmath7 , where @xmath6 is the epicycle frequency of a stellar orbit and @xmath7 is the mode of the wave corresponding to the number of arms @xcite .",
    "these resonances are commonly referred to as corotation and lindblad resonances respectively , and are identified by interpreting photometric and kinematic features of a galaxy .",
    "the assumption that @xmath2 is constant in the spiral arms has yet to be confirmed by direct observation .",
    "an alternative way of measuring @xmath2 is to solve the model - independent tw84 equations .",
    "these are integrated forms of the continuity equation that relate @xmath2 to the brightness of a pattern tracer and the observable line - of - sight velocity .",
    "when @xmath2 is allowed to vary with radius , integrating along paths that are parallel to the kinematic major axis of the galaxy produces an integral equation for @xmath2 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the specific intensity of a pattern tracer and @xmath10 is the line - of - sight velocity times the cosecant of the disk inclination .",
    "an illustration showing how a galaxy s disk is oriented in the coordinate system of equation ( 1 ) is shown in figure 1 . in this coordinate system , @xmath11 is measured in the plane of the disk .",
    "equation ( 1 ) is similar to equation ( 4 ) in tw84 with the exception that @xmath2 is allowed to vary with radius .",
    "although allowing @xmath2 to vary with radius may violate assumption 2 .",
    "in tw84 , it can be shown that the derivation by tw84 is generalizable to a pattern speed that varies with radius ( for a proof see engstrm 1994 , hereafter e94 ) .",
    "the steps involved in deriving equation ( 1 ) for h1.5pt i are shown in section 2.2 .",
    "the new solution method uses least squares to solve equation ( 1 ) for simple functional forms of @xmath2 .",
    "the two forms solved for in this paper are a polynomial in @xmath0 = @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a polynomial in 1/@xmath0 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 are unknown constants to be determined in the solution .",
    "both equations can represent a constant @xmath2 when @xmath16 = 0 .",
    "although they are simple in their form , equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are adequate for investigating whether @xmath2 has a radial dependence .",
    "if evidence for such a dependence is found , then the pattern is shearing , and the solution obtained when @xmath16 = 0 is the mean pattern speed .     = @xmath17 axis .",
    "an example of an integration path at @xmath11 = @xmath18 is shown as a solid line across the disk.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    to find the least squares solution , first combine equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to form a sum on the left hand side of equation ( 1 ) , @xmath19 and similarly for equation ( 3 ) , @xmath20 what remains inside the integrals are observable quantities that can be calculated at different @xmath11 = @xmath18 distances from the kinematic major axis ( see figure 1 ) . for several independent calculations",
    "let , @xmath21 for equation ( 4 ) , and similarly , @xmath22 for equation ( 5 ) , where that matrix indexing is used for @xmath23 rows and @xmath24 columns . also let , @xmath25 for the right hand sides of equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) the @xmath24th column corresponds to the power of @xmath0 in @xmath2",
    ". in equations ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , and ( 8) the @xmath23th row corresponds to a calculation at @xmath18 . using these matrices , equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in matrix form are , @xmath26 where that @xmath27 @xmath4 @xmath15 are the unknown coefficients .",
    "multiplying both sides of equation ( 9 ) by the transpose of * g * produces the normal equations , @xmath28 for the least squares problem .",
    "the maximum likelihood solution for the best - fitting coefficients is obtained by multiplying both sides of equation ( 10 ) by ( * g*@xmath29*g*)@xmath30 .",
    "standard statistical tools can then be used to analyze the results and determine whether a constant @xmath2 , or one that varies with @xmath0 , provides a better solution .",

    "the standard errors were found using monte carlo methods .",
    "monte carlo methods are preferred to those using the covariance matrix because such methods assume @xmath68 = 0 , which is not true in this case . for ten - thousand iterations ,",
    "normally distributed random noise with standard deviations of @xmath68 and @xmath69 were added to * g * and * d * respectively , and solutions were found for the coefficients .",
    "the standard deviations in the distributions of the results were adopted as estimates of se@xmath63 .",

    "monte carlo methods produced confidence intervals and confidence bands @xmath1 1 - 10% greater than methods using the covariance matrix .",
    "the difference was greatest for forms of @xmath2 having the most terms .",
    "estimates of @xmath68 and @xmath69 were found by propagating estimates of the uncertainty per pixel , @xmath52 and @xmath70 given in section 2.3 , as well as the uncertainties in @xmath49 and @xmath11 , through the calculations of * g * and * d*. the rms noise in a line - free channel is a lower limit to @xmath71 in a map of @xmath9 where emission is present , so doubling the rms noise should adequately account for @xmath71 . to estimate @xmath70 , the uncertainty per pixel in velocity resolution , the uncertainty in @xmath31 , and the uncertainty in inclination were propagated through the calculation of @xmath10 . following the reasoning of @xcite , the uncertainty per pixel that is due to the velocity resolution was estimated as the channel width divided by the number of channels in which a detection occurs .",
    "jvm95 show that only the brightest h1.5pt i appears in more than two channels of the data cube , the weakest detections appear in one , and the majority appears in about two . the uncertainty due to the velocity resolution",
    "was therefore set to one - half the channel width .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath49 and @xmath11 were calculated from the uncertainties in the kinematic center and the position angle ( pa ) .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath11 also included the uncertainty in the inclination angle .    to avoid the need for propagating the uncertainties in @xmath49 and @xmath11 that are due to uncertainties in the distance to ngc 1365 , the instrumental units of the vla , [ @xmath2 ] = km s@xmath30 arcsec@xmath30 ,",
    "are used for calculating equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and reporting the results .",
    "furthermore , using units common for galactic disks , [ @xmath2 ] = km s@xmath30 kpc@xmath30 , would introduce an unnecessary amount of uncertainty when determining the functional form of @xmath2 that provides the best solution , or when comparing the results with those obtained using other solution methods and from previous estimates .",
    "after the analysis , the most important results are reported in units commonly used for galactic disks .",
    "the uncertainties for the converted results are reported as 1@xmath73 uncertainties , which were estimated by propagating the standard errors for the coefficients and the uncertainty for the distance through the conversion .",
    "errors in the pa can contribute to errors in the coefficients that are not represented in the propagated uncertainties .",
    "monte - carlo error estimations were used to examine this effect . for ten - thousand iterations ,",
    "a pa was randomly chosen from a normal distribution of angles centered on the assumed pa whose standard deviation was equal to the uncertainty in pa , @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting distributions in the coefficients were typically non - gaussian , and produced pattern speeds that were most often smaller than those derived using the assumed pa",
    ". it would therefore be inappropriate to add the standard deviations in the results for the monte - carlo estimates in quadrature to the uncertainties in the coefficients in order to account for @xmath74 .",
    "instead , the effect of an incorrect pa is discussed for each galaxy on a case by case basis .",
    "the percent error due to an incorrect pa is much smaller than those that are typically reported for the original solution method of tw84 .",
    "the percent error for the original solution method can be as large as 25% for a 2@xmath75 error in pa , and 100% for a 5@xmath75 error in pa ( debattista 2003 ; debattista & williams 2003 ) .",
    "the precent errors for the current method are about 1/4 as large .",
    "finally , the total uncertainty for each @xmath23th calculation of equation ( 4 ) or ( 5 ) , @xmath76 , was used for finding @xmath77 ( and @xmath57 ) .",
    "these were estimated as , @xmath78 by following the reasoning of bevington & robinson ( 2002 ) to take into account both @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "the primary goal of the analysis is to determine the functional form of @xmath2 that provides the best solution , and thus the best estimate of @xmath2 .",
    "starting at order @xmath16 = 0 , the value of @xmath79 was compared with the value obtained after the addition of an extra term .",
    "if there was no improvement in @xmath79 , then the additional term did not provide an improvement to the solution .",
    "if there was an improvement in @xmath79 , then the @xmath80 test of an additional term was used to find the statistical significance of the improvement .",
    "it consists of calculating @xmath81 and finding the probability , @xmath82 , of @xmath80 being as large with the addition of an extra term , should the coefficient of the extra term be zero ( bevington & robinson 2002 ) .",
    "a value of @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 is convincing evidence that the extra term is non - zero , a value of @xmath82 @xmath1 @xmath85 is suggestive , but inconclusive , and larger values are an indication that the improvement is statistically insignificant .",
    "a lower limit of 0.01% was chosen as a cutoff for reporting @xmath82 .",
    "such a small percentage means that the improvement in @xmath86 is extremely statistically significant .",
    "more information about how to interpret values of @xmath82 in the @xmath80 test can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath16 = 1 term , an @xmath80 test providing convincing evidence that it is non - zero is equivalent to relaxing the assumption that @xmath2 is constant .",
    "terms were added based on the results of the @xmath80 test until there was no longer an improvement in @xmath79 , the improvement was no longer statistically significant , or * g*@xmath29*g * became ill conditioned for numerical inversion .",
    "the matrix * g*@xmath29*g * will eventually become ill conditioned for numerical inversion in the same manner that is expected for least squares solutions using polynomials with successively higher order terms . when this occurs",

    "<S> the tremaine - weinberg equations are solved for a pattern speed that is allowed to vary with radius . </S>",
    "<S> the solution method transforms an integral equation for the pattern speed to a least squares problem with well established procedures for statistical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the method applied to the h1.5pt i spiral pattern of the barred , grand - design galaxy ngc 1365 produced convincing evidence for a radial dependence in the pattern speed . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern speed behaves approximately as 1/@xmath0 , and is very similar to the material speed . </S>",
    "<S> there are no clear indications of corotation or lindblad resonances . </S>",
    "<S> tests show that the results are not selection biased , and that the method is not measuring the material speed . </S>",
    "<S> other methods of solving the tremaine - weinberg equations for shearing patterns were found to produce results in agreement with those obtained using the current method . </S>",
    "<S> previous estimates that relied on the assumptions of the density - wave interpretation of spiral structure are inconsistent with the results obtained using the current method . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent with spiral structure theories that allow for shearing patterns , and contradict fundamental assumptions in the density - wave interpretation that are often used for finding spiral arm pattern speeds . </S>",
    "<S> the spiral pattern is winding on a characteristic timescale of @xmath1 500 myrs . </S>"
