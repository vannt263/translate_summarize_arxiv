    "the two wave functions overlap in regions of space a and b where alice and bob perform measurements .",
    "the condensates are described by fock states ( we ignore thermal effects and condensate depletion due to interactions , assuming for instance that the systems are dilute gases ; actually , in this article , for the sake of simplicity we take the word condensateas equivalent to fock state ) .",
    "the initial state @xmath11  of the whole quantum system is then:@xmath12 ^{n_{\\alpha } } \\left [ a_{2}^{\\dagger } \\right ] ^{n_{\\beta } } \\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle   \\label{1}\\]]here @xmath13 is the creation operator into the single particle state @xmath14 , @xmath15 the creation operator into state @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the vacuum state .",
    "we call @xmath18 the quantization axis for spins , and will consider transverse spin measurements performed by alice and bob in any direction perpendicular to @xmath18 .",
    "this state has zero average spin angular momentum along these directions , and zero spin momentum along @xmath19 as well if @xmath20 .",
    "now alice makes @xmath21 spin measurements in her laboratory , choosing transverse directions characterized by polar angles @xmath22 , @xmath23, .. @xmath24 .  these measurements are performed with different apparatuses situated in different regions of space of her laboratory , and they are independent ; we assume that each apparatus detects one single particle ( how to include the case where no particle is found in a particular region of space is discussed in hidden - phase - leiden ) .",
    "similarly , bob performs @xmath25 transverse spin measurements in his laboratory with polar angles @xmath26 , @xmath27, .. @xmath28 .  as in @xcite , we assume that the total number of measurements @xmath29 is much smaller that the total number of particles @xmath30 .  under these conditions , the effects of the quantum angle  mullin - laloe  can be ignored and the relative phase behaves classically.the probability of an event where alice obtains @xmath31 results @xmath7  and @xmath32 results @xmath1 , while bob obtains @xmath33 results @xmath7  and @xmath34 results @xmath1 , is then given by:@xmath35the interpretation of this formula is straightforward : if the two condensates had a relative phase @xmath36 , the probability of finding a result @xmath7 with an apparatus oriented along direction @xmath37 is @xmath38 , and that of finding the opposite result is @xmath39 .",
    "the probability of finding the combined results is the product of the corresponding probabilities ; in this formula , alice s results appear in the first two factors of the product , bob s results in the last two factors .",
    "but @xmath40 is actually completely random between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so that an integral over @xmath36 is necessary ; although the integrand is a product , this integral introduces correlations between the successive results .",
    "this formula is general ; for instance , it remains valid if alice only makes measurements , not bob ; it is sufficient to put @xmath43 , so that the last two products disappear from ( [ 2 ] ) , leaving only a dependence on alice s measurement angles .",
    "remark : for clarity , in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] we have assumed that the single particle state associated with the first condensate has an orbital wave function @xmath6 extending in space continuously from alice s to bob s laboratory;similarly , the second condensate extends continuously from one laboratory to the other .",
    "nevertheless , we could also have assumed that any ( or both ) of the wave functions is the coherent superposition of two disconnected parts , one in region a and another in region b ( as , for instance , in bell experiments where photons propagate to opposite detectors without overlap of their wave packets ) .  provided both wave functions still overlap in each measurement region , nothing is changed in the calculations that will follow .  the continuity of the condensates from region to the other plays no role in the physical effect we discuss , illustrating that it has nothing to do with some wave propagation along the condensates .      the properties of formula ( [ 2 ] ) have been discussed in hidden - phase and @xcite .",
    "all results of measurements have exactly the same probability as for an ensemble of spins with well - defined initial orientations defined by angle @xmath36 , with a random distribution given by a function of this additional variable .",
    "initially , the additional  variable @xmath36 has a completely uniform distribution between @xmath41 and @xmath42 and the first spin measurement provides a completely random result .",
    "then , while measurements accumulate , the distribution of the additional  variable becomes narrower and narrower .",
    "the bayes theorem can be used to show that the @xmath36 distribution after @xmath44 measurements is nothing by the product of cosines and sines squared that appears under the integral of ( [ 2 ] ) ; so this distribution is known at any step of the experiment . at some point , this distribution becomes very narrow ; alice s measurements have practically determined the relative phase between the condensates ( with some uncertainty ) ; if she makes further measurements in the direction in which the spins now point , she obtains results that are practically certain .    to illustrate the evolution of the @xmath36 distribution",
    ", we have performed simple numerical simulations using the same method as in mullin - krotkov - laloe .",
    "we rewrite eq .",

    "the initial distribution ( @xmath56 ) is perfectly flat and the first result completely random .",
    "then alice starts a series of @xmath57 measurements along an arbitrary angle @xmath58 , with random results obtained from the @xmath50 distribution at each step depending on all previous results according to eq .",

    "she finds @xmath59 up spins and @xmath60 down spins .",
    "but as the distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows , at this stage she is unable to tell whether the polarization that has developed during her measurements ( or that was already there ) is at a positive or negative angle with respect to her original zero angle .",
    "note the sharpness of the distribution after this relatively small number of measurements .",

    "[ fig2 ] .",
    ", the total probability distribution after alice s second series of 300 measurements .",
    "she now knows the polarization is near @xmath67,width=288 ]    the same calculations apply to bob s measurements . to make the argument easy to follow",
    "we suppose that bob picks his first set of angles also to be @xmath68 ; our simulation shows that he measures @xmath59 , @xmath60 , implying an angle of @xmath69 . if he does not know alice s results",
    ", he can not determine its sign .",
    "he therefore makes a measurement at @xmath70 to determine it , to find @xmath71 , @xmath72 so that this estimate gives the polarization angle as @xmath73 radians from his present angle , or at @xmath74 . to check this result",
    "he measures 100 spins exactly at this angle and gets 99 spins up and only 1 down .",
    "the angle found by bob is very close to what alice found .      according to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , alice and bob share the same @xmath36 distribution .",
    "this is the reason why , as we have just seen , if bob starts making his experiments when alice has finished hers , he will necessarily find a direction of @xmath36 that falls inside the peak of the distribution produced by alice .",
    "but if he is not aware of the results obtained by alice , he will not notice anything special : to him , his results appear to be the same as if no previous measurement had been made.nevertheless , when both compare their results at the end of the experiment , they can check that both have independently determined @xmath36 distributions that are compatible : they then realize that alice s results have determined in advance the direction in which bob has found the spins.in other words , alice s measurements fix the relative phase of the two condensates and therefore the direction of bob s spins , which is doubly paradoxical : first , if both laboratories are very remote , alice can not interact with bob s spins , which acquire a given direction by a non - local effect ; second , alice may perform her experiments on a small number of spins , @xmath75 or @xmath76 for instance , while the spin orientation appearing in bob s laboratory may be macroscopic .",
    "how can a macroscopic physical quantity appear under the effect of arbitrarily remote measurements performed on a microscopic sample of atoms ?",
    "another paradox arises when one asks the origin of the angular momentum associated with the transverse orientation of bob s spins , after alice has made her measurements ( but before bob started to make his ) . since these spins have interacted with no external physical system",
    ", one could expect that their angular momentum should remain unchanged .",
    "how can a measurement performed in alice laboratory change the angular momentum contain in bob s , especially since this momentum is macroscopic ? but",
    "quantum mechanics predicts the values that bob can observe when measuring this angular momentum have indeed changed .",
    "the effect of alice s measurement is instantaneous , and has nothing to do with the propagation of any signal along the condensates , the wave functions do not necessarily extend continuously from one region to the other ; the phenomenon can not be seen as due to some kind of vibration propagating along the wave functions , even at infinite velocity . ]",
    "( bogolubov phonons for instance ) ; it is a pure non - local effect arising from the quantum measurement postulate .",
    "the paradox is then that macroscopic angular momentum seems to appear from nothing in bob s laboratory .",
    "paraoanu and healey @xcite  have studied the problem and propose a way to solve the paradox .",
    "they state that , after alice has made her first measurements , \" when bob measures the spin - component on the large cloud of condensate in his region , far from alice , he is almost certain to get a macroscopic result .",
    "but his does not mean that alice s measurement produces a ` real ' macroscopic value of angular momentum in bob s region.bobs measurement does not simply reveal this macroscopic value of a pre - existing spin - component of or in the cloud produced by alice s projective measurement .",
    "instead , the macroscopic spin - component ` emerges ' during bob s measurement following an interaction with bob s measuring device .... certainly nothing that happens near alice creates a macroscopic angular momentum near bob in violation of local conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the central point of their argument is therefore that it is not possible to attribute physical reality to any physical quantity ( here angular momentum ) prior to its measurement , even if the state of the system is already an eigenstate of the corresponding observable before measurement .",
    "if no real  angular momentum exists in bob s laboratory before bob measures it with his apparatus , and comes to existence only during his measurement , it becomes natural to assume that this apparatus takes the angular momentum recoil that is necessary to ensure a local conservation of angular momentum .",
    "the purpose of the present article is therefore to study the angular momentum recoil of both measurement apparatuses , and examine if bob s apparatus can take the recoil that is necessary to ensure momentum conservation ; if so , the paradox can be lifted .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis shows that this is not the case , so that the paradox remains .",
    "before studying the paradoxical experiment , where the spin system is initially in a double fock state ( double condensate ) , we discuss a simpler case where the spin system starts from a phase state .  in this case ,",
    "a macroscopic transverse spin orientation exists from the beginning of the experiment .      instead of ( [ 1 ] )",
    ", we now assume that the initial state of the measured system is a phase state , with the same total number of particles @xmath77 .",
    "this state depends on an arbitrary phase parameter @xmath78 and has the following expression:@xmath79 ^{n}\\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle   \\label{3}\\]]it can be seen as a single condensate where all @xmath80 particles are in the same individual state:@xmath81   \\label{4}\\]]where @xmath82 and @xmath83  are the single particle eigenstates of the @xmath18 component of the spin and @xmath84 are the orbital states associated with the two condensates .",
    "actually these orbital states play no particular role in the discussion @xcite ; we can assume that they coincide , or even ignore them .",
    "the spin of the single particle state ( [ 4 ] ) is fully polarized in a transverse direction of the @xmath85 plane making azimuthal angle @xmath78 with axis @xmath86 . in this case , the probability ( [ 2 ] ) is replaced by:@xmath87the integral over @xmath36 has now disappeared : all measurements  are independent , which is not surprising since all spins are initially polarized in the same direction .    consider a given spin measurement and the angular momentum transferred to the measurement apparatus .",
    "initially , the average angular momentum projected along the measurement direction @xmath88 is equal to @xmath89 ; after measurement , it takes the value @xmath90 or @xmath91 randomly , but on average it is:@xmath92 = \\frac{\\hslash } { 2}\\cos \\left ( \\lambda _ { 0}-\\varphi _ { a}^{j}\\right ) \\label{6}\\]]the projected angular momentum may be larger or smaller , depending on the result of measurement , but on average it keeps the same value as before measurement . the mean - square deviation @xmath93  of the angular momentum transfer during @xmath94 identical measurements is given by:@xmath95",
    "^{2}+\\sin ^{2}\\left ( \\frac{\\lambda _ { 0}-\\varphi _ { a}^{j}}{2}\\right ) \\left [ -1-\\cos \\left ( \\lambda _ { 0}-\\varphi _ { a}^{j}\\right ) \\right ] ^{2}\\right\\ }   \\notag \\\\ & = & p\\left ( \\frac{\\hslash } { 2}\\right ) ^{2}\\sin ^{2}\\left ( \\lambda _ { 0}-\\varphi _ { a}^{j}\\right )   \\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\]]as a consequence , on average over many spin measurements , the measurement apparatuses takes zero angular momentum recoil .",
    "nevertheless , this recoil has a fluctuation that is proportional to the square root of the number of realizations .    without knowing the value of @xmath78 ,",
    "alice and bob can determine it through their measurements .",
    "in a first step , alice can choose any orientation @xmath37",
    "for her measurements , and obtain an approximate value of the cosine of the angle between this orientation and that of the spins .",
    "she can then choose a perpendicular direction to obtain the sine of this angle , removing the previous sign indeterminacy mullin - krotkov - laloe .",
    "after a few measurements , the best way to narrow the distribution of possible values of @xmath78 is to make spin measurements in a direction perpendicular to her first estimation of @xmath96 . in this way , after a reasonable number of measurements , @xmath75 for instance , she has determined @xmath78 with good accuracy.finally , if she continues making spin measurements parallel to this direction , almost no fluctuation remains in the results : these measurements only confirm what she already knows , and perturb the spin system very little .  on the whole , alice can determine the value of @xmath78 by transferring to her apparatus an angular momentum of the order of @xmath97 , maybe ten times more if she really needs an excellent accuracy , but she certainly does not need to transfer a macroscopic number times of @xmath98 to obtain the information .    of course the same is true for bob : to acquire information on the direction of the ( pre - existing ) spin angular momentum in his laboratory , he may need to transfer some angular momentum to his measurement apparatus , but again not more than @xmath99 or @xmath75 times @xmath98 .",
    "we now come back to the original thought experiment with the initial state ( [ 1 ] ) , where the initial angular momentum does not pre - exist measurements , but is created by them .",
    "we must then use eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) again , and we assume that @xmath20 .",
    "as we have recalled above (   [ non - local - appearance ] ) , when alice starts performing measurements , the @xmath100 distribution is completely flat between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and the probabilities of the two results are equal ( in contrast with ",
    "preliminary - expt ) .",
    "but , as soon as measurements become available , the @xmath100 distribution becomes a product of sines and cosines , which becomes a more and more peaked function .",
    "as above , we assume that alice chooses appropriate measurement angles to avoid sign ambiguities on @xmath36 and to optimize her definition of @xmath36 .",
    "after @xmath75 or @xmath76 measurements , the @xmath100 distribution has become a narrow peak around some value @xmath101 , and one reaches a situation that is essentially the same as in   [ preliminary - expt ] .",
    "starting from this situation , bob can obviously apply exactly the same strategy as alice ; he does not know the value of @xmath78 , but can measure it by transferring not more than @xmath99 or @xmath75 units of @xmath98 to his measurement apparatus .",
    "after this preliminary operation , he can choose a direction of measurement that is parallel to @xmath78 and make an arbitrary number of measurements , even macroscopic , without transferring appreciable momentum to his apparatus . even if he continues to choose random directions of measurement ,",
    "the angular momentum transfer increases only as the square root of the number of measurements , not linearly with it .",
    "so it is clear that the angular momentum transfer to his apparatus remains totally negligible with respect to the measured spin angular momentum .",
    "we therefore see that , even if we consider that angular momentum does not exist before it is measured ( including the case where the state before measurement is an eigenstate of the measured observable ) , the amount of angular momentum appearing in bob s laboratory can not be compensated by an opposite angular momentum transferred to his apparatus .",
    "again , angular momentum seems to have appeared from nowhere .",
    "after alice has performed at least one measurement , the two condensates are strongly entangled .",
    "this is because her measurements relate to a coherent superposition of the two spin states , so that they can not distinguish between spins of each condensate .",
    "the unmeasured spins are therefore left in a coherent superposition of states where the population of each condensate fluctuates , with their sum constant .",
    "this raises the general question of quantum measurements performed on entangled systems which , as we know , are not separable  in quantum mechanics ; they should be considered as a whole .",
    "could it be that , when a measurement is performed on a small physical system that is entangled with another large system , the reaction of the system on the measurement apparatus is completely changed by the entanglement , becoming macroscopic instead of microscopic ?",
    "the epitome of an entangled states is a so called ghz state ( all or nothing state ) , for which ( 1 ) is replaced by:@xmath102 \\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle    \\label{8}\\]]with this state , if alice measures the @xmath18 component of a single spin , all subsequent measurements ( by her or by bob ) will find the same result as the first measurement : measuring the direction of one single spin instantaneously fixes a parallel direction for all other spins.nevertheless , before the first measurement , the average value of the @xmath18 total spin component vanished .  here again , angular momentum conservation during the first measurement would imply that the measuring apparatus must take the corresponding recoil .",
    "so one could conclude that , because alice s spins are part of a quantum system that is an indivisible whole , alice s apparatus takes a macroscopic angular momentum .",
    "we discuss this question further in the next section .",
    "our conclusion is therefore that , even if we consider only situations where angular momentum has been measured by alice and bob , the origin of the large angular momentum that appears in bob s laboratory can not be found in his measurement apparatus , which actually absorbs very little angular momentum.if we wish to preserve local conservation of angular momentum during measurement processes , what are the possibilities to solve the paradox ?",
    "\\(i ) a first possibility is to consider that angular momentum is not necessarily conserved in each realization of the experiment , but only on average .  indeed , the standard mathematical proof of angular momentum conservation when @xmath103 and @xmath104 commute shows that the average @xmath105 remains unchanged ; the proof applies to any power of @xmath103 , in other words that the complete distribution of probability is constant .",
    "but the proof says nothing of individual events .",
    "\\(ii ) according to our analysis , it is not bob s apparatus that takes the angular momentum recoil , so could it be alice s that takes the macroscopic recoil ?",
    "after all , it is her actions that apply state vector reduction and transform the initial state vector ( [ 1 ] ) , with no transverse average angular momentum , into ( [ 4 ] ) where all spins are transversely polarized ; in other words , it is her measurements that fuse  the two condensates into one and create a single condensate described by a phase state with large angular momentum .  in this case , one should consider that , even if he directly interacts with @xmath75 spins only , since these spins are parts of ( entangled with ) a much larger quantum system , her measurement relates to the whole system .",
    "the problem with such a view is that it seems to imply instantaneous signalling , creating a blatant contradiction with relativity .",
    "this is because alice s measurement could reveal if , for instance , bob has destroyed his condensate , or rotated its spin direction by applying a magnetic field .",
    "the same reasoning applies to the ghz state discussed above .",
    "so this explanation does not seem appropriate .",
    "\\(iii ) on could argue that some super - selection rule  forbids the preparation of such double fock initial states.clearly , gaseous spin condensates extending over long distances are extremely fragile objects , even if repulsive interactions between the atoms tend to stabilize them .",
    "one can therefore question the accessibility of such double spin condensates .",
    "nevertheless bose - einstein condensation seems to provide a mechanism to generate such double fock states in dilute gases , since repulsive interactions favor the population of a single quantum state ( @xcite ) , and this explanation sounds rather artificial .",
    "\\(iv ) another explanation is to introduce additional variables , as suggested in @xcite .  in this case ,",
    "quantum mechanics would not be considered complete .  in this perspective",
    ", transverse angular momentum would exist from the beginning , and no paradox at all would occur .",
    "nevertheless , as discussed in @xcite , these additional variables should have a component having non - local evolution since they can give rise to bell inequality violations .    in conclusion ,",
    "the thought experiment we have discussed is not so remote from experimentally accessible situations ; the spontaneous appearance of transverse spin polarization has already already been detected experimentally @xcite .  from a theoretical point of view , the compatibility between quantum mechanics and the no - signalling constraint of relativity has been the subject of many articles ( for reviews , for instance see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the usual conclusion shimony is that quantum mechanics remains compatible with relativity , even if parts of its formalism contains ingredients that are non - local and escape space - time description ( no story in spacetime can tell us how nonlocal correlations happen@xcite).nevertheless , the present work focuses , not on the formalism , but on the results of measurements and their effects on measurement apparatuses , that is macroscopic events that can presumably be considered as space - time events .",
    "this makes the tensionwith relativity even more visible",
    ". it may be interesting to follow the line opened by wigner @xcite and examine in detail the general question of how quantum systems react on measurement apparatuses , in particular when they are entangled with another quantum system .",
    "this would be useful to better understand how quantum mechanics manages to remain fully compatible with relativity , and the reasons why a peaceful coexistence between special relativity and quantum mechanics  @xcite can be maintained .",
    "a conclusion of the present work is that , except if one prefers theories with non - local additional variables , the simplest way to preserve non - signalling is that proposed in ( i ) above : consider that angular momentum conservation applies only statistically , but not in each realization of an experiment .",
