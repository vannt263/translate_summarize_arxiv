    "silicene , a monolayer of silicon atoms forming a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice , has been predicted to be stable @xcite and several attempts have been made to synthesize it @xcite .",
    "it has attracted considerable attention @xcite because due to its honeycomb lattice , it has dirac cones similar to those of graphene but with some important differences induced by the buckled structure of its lattice .",
    "contrary to graphene , silicene has a strong intrinsic spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) which leads to a gap of approximately @xmath7 mev wide @xcite in the low - energy band structure .",
    "the buckled structure is a remarkable property of silicene that graphene does not possess and can facilitate the control @xcite of its band gap by the application of an external perpendicular electric field @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , silicene could overcome difficulties associated with potential applications of graphene in nanoelectronics ( lack of a controllable gap ) due to the available spin and valley degrees of freedom .",
    "this and its compatibility with silicon - based technology led to ample studies of important effects such as the spin- and valley - hall effects @xcite , the quantum anomalous hall effect @xcite , spin - valley coupling @xcite , etc .. for a review see ref . .",
    "the strong soi in silicene @xcite can lead not only to spin - resolved transport , but also to a cross correlation between the valley and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "further , silicon has a longer spin - diffusion time @xcite and spin - coherence length @xcite compared with graphene @xcite , thus making silicene appear even more suitable for spintronics applications .",
    "notice , for instance , the very recently reported field - effect transistors @xcite .    in earlier works several novel features have been studied such as ferromagnetic ( fm ) correlations @xcite and resonant transport through double barriers @xcite in graphene , the conductance @xcite across fm strips on the surface of a topological insulator or on silicene @xcite .",
    "the study of the influence of electric and exchange fields on ballistic transport through single @xcite and double @xcite fm barriers on silicene led to novel results such as a field - dependent transport gap and near perfect spin and valley polarizations .",
    "naturally , one wonders whether a better control can be obtained if one uses multiple barriers or wells and how the reported effects carry over to arrays of barriers . to our knowledge",
    "this has not been done and is the subject of this study .",
    "the main findings of this work are as follows .",
    "a gap develops in the charge conductance @xmath8 not only when @xmath2 @xcite is varied but also when the strength @xmath1 of the fm field is ; it widens by increasing the number of barriers .",
    "we also quantify the spin and valley polarizations and show that the ranges of @xmath1 in which they are near 100% widen significantly by increasing the number of barriers .",
    "in addition , we show that for wells the conductance @xmath8 oscillates with @xmath1 but the polarizations are much smaller than those for barriers .",
    "all these quantities oscillate nearly periodically with the separation between barriers or wells .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] we pre- + sent results for the spin- and valley - resolved transmission through one or several fm junctions . in sec . [",
    "sec : results ] we show that the charge conductance can be controlled by @xmath4 or @xmath1 and discuss the effects of the field @xmath1 on the charge , spin , and valley transport through one or several barriers or wells .",

    "we study ballistic electron transport across a fm strip in silicene with a metallic gate above it which extends over a region of width @xmath0 ( see fig .",

    "the effective hamiltonian for low - energy fermions is given by @xcite @xmath9 here @xmath10 distinguishes between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 valleys , @xmath13 m / s is the fermi velocity , and @xmath14  is the lattice constant . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is the familiar dirac - type hamiltonian .",
    "the second term @xmath15 describes the intrinsic soi in silicene through @xmath16 and controls the soi gap through the perpendicular electric field term @xmath17 with @xmath18  the vertical separation of the two sublattices that is due to the buckled structure .",
    "the band gap is suppressed if the electric field is at its critical value of approximately @xmath19 mv /  .",
    "the third term represents the barrier potential due to the gate voltage , and the term @xmath20 the exchange field due to a fm film ; @xmath21 is the identity matrix .",
    "further , @xmath22 represents spin - up @xmath23 and spin - down @xmath24 states , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the pauli matrices of respectively the spin and the sublattice pseudospin .    the first term on the second line of eq .",
    "( 1 ) denotes a weak _ extrinsic _ rashba term , due to the field @xmath4 , of strength @xmath27 .",
    "the buckling referred to above is also responsible for a small _ intrinsic _ rashba effect @xcite of strength @xmath28 ; this is the last term in eq . ( 1 ) .",
    "these rashba terms @xcite result from the mixing of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 orbitals due to atomic sois and , in the extrinsic case , the stark effect . in general",
    ", they arise when the inversion symmetry of the lattice is broken . in silicene , however , these terms are very small and can be neglected .",
    "the extrinsic rashba effect slightly affects the gap at the dirac point , which closes when the field strength is @xmath31 the correction term @xmath32 accounts only for 0.4 % .",
    "the term @xmath33 increases the kinetic energy by @xmath34 which is negligible ( @xmath35 % ) compared to the main contribution @xmath36 .",
    "our numerical results have first been calculated using the complete four - spinor description of eq .",
    "( 1 ) outlined in the appendix . in line",

    "@xcite we found no sizable differences between them and those obtained with these terms neglected .",

    "this figure suggests the polarization mechanism discussed in this work .",
    "indeed , by tuning @xmath39 and or @xmath1 one can make the fermi level @xmath40 move up or down and have only one or both spin states occupied .",

    "@xcite they are present only in the barriers .",
    "it reduces to their result for @xmath47 outside the barrier .",
    "notice that for @xmath48 , @xmath49 integer , the transmission is perfect .",
    "these fabry - prot resonances occur when half the wavelength of the wave inside the barrier fits @xmath49 times inside it .",
    "a considerable simplification of eq . ( [ eq : transmission ] ) occurs at normal incidence ( @xmath50 ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 . from this analytical result",
    "the difference with the graphene result @xmath53 is clear . due to",
    "the soi and the field @xmath4 the factor @xmath54 differs from @xmath55 .",
    "setting @xmath56 , one obtains @xmath57 , i.e. , the well - known graphene result @xmath53 no matter what the barrier width @xmath0 is .",
    "this unimpeded tunnelling at normal incidence , called klein tunnelling , also takes place if the electric field attains its critical value @xmath58 . in this case , however , only the spin - up ( spin - down ) electrons at the k ( @xmath59 point experience the klein effect .",
    "the origin of this partial klein tunneling can be found in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transmission ] ) when the condition @xmath60 is satisfied .",

    "the spin- and valley resolved conductance is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the length of the barrier along the @xmath74-direction .",
    "the total charge conductance @xmath8 is obtained by summing eq .",
    "( [ eq : conductancedefinition ] ) over @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "making use of the measurable conductance , we can define the spin polarization as @xmath77 with @xmath78 if the electrons are fully polarized in the up ( down ) mode .",
    "analogously , we define the valley polarization by @xmath79 here @xmath80 corresponds to a current that is localised completely in the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) valley .",
    "we first present results for transmission , conductance , and spin and valley polarizations through one or several barriers and then those for one or several wells .",
    "the calculations are done using the four - component spinors given in the appendix and the fields @xmath4 and @xmath1 are everywhere . however , since the rashba terms are indeed very small @xcite , there is no discernible difference , in the parameter ranges used , between the four - component spinor results and the analytic ones based on eqs.(2)-(5 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "accordingly , we show results for the case these terms are neglected and the fields @xmath4 and @xmath1 are inside the barriers .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ] we present @xmath81 contour plots of the spin resolved transmission through one , two , and ten barriers in the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd row , respectively , at the @xmath11 valley . the left ( right ) column is for spin - up ( spin - down ) electrons .",
    "the electric field is chosen to be the critical field @xmath58 as defined above .",
    "accordingly , the spin - down electrons have a gapless and linear energy spectrum and therefore for normal incidence ( @xmath82 ) the transmission for this state is 1 due to klein tunneling .",
    "since the spin - up state s spectrum still shows a gap , there are no propagating modes in the barrier if the fermi energy is close to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the transmission is suppressed in an energy region of the size of the gap around the top of the barrier .    moving to the 2nd row of fig .",
    "3 , for two barriers , one sees additional resonances .",
    "remarkably they also appear in the gap indicating that they correspond to localized states in the region between the barriers .",
    "note , however , that they disappear as we move to the 3rd row ( 10 barriers ) .",
    "this is because the additional resonances appearing for @xmath83 are due to a confinement in the total barrier structure and become highly damped for @xmath84 .",
    "the only resonances that are undamped in this case are the single - barrier resonances since they are shared by all barriers .",
    "these resonances are sharper since the near - resonance evanescent modes that contribute to the transmission are suppressed because the effective length of the barrier is larger .",
    "the same mechanism also renders the gap in the transmission wider for @xmath82 .",
    "the shape of the fabry - prot resonances in the ( @xmath85,@xmath86 ) plane can be understood by applying the condition @xmath87 for the energy .",
    "the result for the simplified case where @xmath88 is ( @xmath89 ) @xmath90^{1/2}\\big/\\cos ^{2}\\theta   \\label{eq : resonances}\\ ] ] this relation is shown as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ] . for the values of @xmath49",
    "for which @xmath91 is small , the energy solutions become approximately independent of @xmath86 , which corresponds to resonances at low energies almost independent of @xmath86 . for other values of @xmath49",
    "the resonant energies behave proportional to @xmath92 .    because experimentally one measures the conductance and not the transmission , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductancefirst ] the conductance as a function of the field @xmath4 ( first row ) and of the field @xmath1 ( second row ) for @xmath93 , and @xmath94 barriers as indicated .",
    "we see that the conductance is symmetric with respect to both @xmath4 and @xmath1 , it is reduced by increasing the number of barriers , and , perhaps more important , it develops a gap , i.e. , it vanishes , when plotted versus @xmath1 , for very strong fields @xmath4 .",
    "the physical origin of the transport gap lies in the suppression of evanescent modes as @xmath4 increases . for one barrier",
    "this is similar to the transport gap of the conductance , plotted versus the energy at the dirac point @xcite .",
    "if @xmath40 is fixed at the correct value , there are no propagating modes inside the barrier region .",
    "the field @xmath1 can then be used to shift the spectra of both spins so as to coincide with @xmath40 .",
    "this gives rise to the observed abrupt increase in the conductance as a function of @xmath1 . with many barriers in the system ,",
    "the contribution of evanescent modes near the edges of the gap is exponentially suppressed .",
    "therefore , the gap is widened and sharpened .    because evanescent tunneling is suppressed with the number of barriers , the spin @xmath5 and valley @xmath6 polarizations are altered as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spinvalleypolarization ] versus @xmath1 .",
    "for one barrier this is similar to the @xmath5 or @xmath6 results ( versus @xmath95 ) of ref .",
    "notice , though , that the @xmath1 ranges of near perfect @xmath5 and @xmath6 widen with the number of barriers .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : compareconductancepolarization ] we show the dependence of the conductance , spin and valley polarization on the fields @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "the results show that it is possible to achieve independently a strong spin and valley polarization by a proper tuning of these fields .",
    "for example , at the position marked with @xmath96 , the current is polarized in the @xmath12 valley ( @xmath97 ) but also consists only of spin - up particles ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the use of multiple barriers makes this polarization more pronounced .",

    "we can also exploit the additional degree of freedom given by the barrier separation @xmath105 to tune the polarization . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwplots ] we show a @xmath106 contour plot of the conductance and polarizations for @xmath107 barriers .",
    "as shown , increasing the barrier width @xmath0 has a progressively detrimental effect on the conductance .",
    "but , thanks to the periodic dependence of all these quantities at appropriate values of @xmath0 , it is possible to realize a pure spin polarization and a valley mixed state as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwplots ] .",
    "we further explore the spin and valley polarizations by changing the magnetization @xmath1 of the two barriers independently at fixed barrier width @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : d1d2plot ] shows a near perfect spin - up polarization for a very wide range of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this can become spin - down polarization if we reverse @xmath1 or change @xmath2 . in either case",
    "we have a perfect spin filter , say , for @xmath112 nm , @xmath113 .",

    "the left ( right ) column is for spin - up ( spin - down ) electrons .",
    "as seen , similar to the case of graphene @xcite , for certain angles the transmission is periodic in energy . similar to the case of barriers , for the double",
    "well there is a new resonance pattern appearing and for a large number of wells the resonances become sharper and only those related to the single well case survive . notice that the transmission is nearly perfect in a wider range of angles @xmath86 compared to that for barriers .    as far as the conductance",
    "is concerned , fig .",
    "[ fig : wellconductance ] shows that its overall behaviour , versus @xmath4 and @xmath1 , is similar to that for barriers shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductancefirst ] .",
    "however , we do nt have a gap versus @xmath1 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductancefirst ] because now the modes are always propagating . as for the spin and valley polarizations , they are about one order of magnitude smaller than those involving barriers and are not shown .    as a function of the energy , the conductance",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wellbarrierconductance ] for @xmath49 barriers on the left and for @xmath49 wells on the right .",

    "the behaviour is similar to that of refs .",
    "@xcite for silicene and ref .",
    "@xcite for graphene .",
    "the reduction with increasing @xmath49 can be understood by the fact the conductance is mainly governed by evanescent tunneling of modes that are near resonant .",
    "this results in a smearing of the resonances and of the transmission due to klein - tunneling and , consequently , a decrease of the conductance in the multi - barrier or multi - well system .",
    "the use of multiple barrier and well structures allows for a new approach in searching for tunable valley and spin polarizations in silicene .",
    "our analytical results help to clearly comprehend the transmission resonances in multi - barrier and multi - well structures .",
    "we found that a transport gap in the conductance develops not only when @xmath2 is varied @xcite but also when @xmath1 is . for multiple barriers this gap , as well as the spin and valley polarizations , widen with @xmath49 because of the suppression of nearly propagating modes .",
    "this same mechanism also sharpens the resonances found in single barriers .    the quantitative assessment of the conductance and of the polarizations , as functions of the applied electric and exchange fields , the width of the barriers or wells and their separation , suggests a selection of parameters to use in order to obtain the desired spin and valley polarizations .",
    "in this respect , one may wonder how reasonable the parameters we used are . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a typical @xmath4 value is @xcite @xmath116 nm and one for @xmath1 , though for graphene @xcite , is @xmath117 mev .",
    "additionally , the use of electric field strengths up to 2.7 v / nm have been reported for bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the range of the @xmath4 and @xmath1 values used in our calculations as well as some critical values of theirs are entirely reasonable .",
    "we also notice that all these quantities oscillate nearly periodically with the separation between barriers or wells .",
    "finally we showed that for wells the conductance oscillates with the exchange field and that the transport gap observed for barriers is absent .",
