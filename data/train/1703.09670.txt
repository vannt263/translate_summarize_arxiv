    "energy harvesting delivers the necessary energy to operate the untethered iot devices and alleviate the complete dependence on batteries  @xcite .",
    "energy harvesting transducers can harvest energy from ambient sources and convert it to useful electrical energy .",
    "radio - frequency ( rf ) inductive devices convert electromagnetic energy to electrical energy .",
    "rf energy source is relatively omnipresent compared with solar , thermal , and vibration energy sources .",
    "rf energy harvesting can be used in tandem with other energy harvesting technologies .",
    "for example , the scavenged rf energy can prevent a solar - charged battery from discharging at night  @xcite .",
    "the harvester output can be in the forms of direct power or stored energy that charges super - capacitors or lithium ion batteries .",
    "in particular , passive rf energy harvesting is promising that it exploits ambient rf sources instead of intentional high - power rf sources  @xcite .    however , rf energy harvesting has a drawback .",
    "typical electric field strengths are weak ( unless located close to sources ) , which severely limits the quantity of energy that can be harvested . the passive rf energy harvesting of today s technology can only generate energy approximately an order of magnitude less than indoor solar and thermoelectric devices . to overcome this",
    ", we will coordinate multiple wireless transmissions of nearby communication systems and purposely concentrate the rf radiation at the energy harvesters .",
    "instead of working on the energy harvester side , we develop transmission techniques on the wireless information systems side to simplify the design of the iot devices .    in wireless communications , multi - user transmissions in interference channels",
    "imply competition and cooperation",
    ". if the transmissions are over multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) channels , each user designs its signal transmit covariance matrix to maximize the information rate while inevitably generating inference to others . when there are rf energy harvesters in the network , the multi - user transmission problem needs to take into account both the communication constraints and the energy - harvesting requirements .",
    "as multiple antennas are used at the communication transceivers , the energy is beamformed to the harvesters .",
    "coordinating multiple wireless transmitters for rf concentration is less demanding than interference management among the wireless communication systems .",
    "we just need to `` accumulate '' the interference power at the energy harvesters .",
    "simultaneous wireless information and energy transfer has attracted significant attention recently  @xcite . the fundamental performance limits and the optimal transmission strategies have been studied in various communication scenarios such as the downlink of a cellular system  @xcite , the cooperative relay system  @xcite , and the broadcasting system  @xcite .",
    "also , several transmission strategies and power allocation methods have been proposed for multi - user multiple - input single - output ( miso ) scenario  @xcite . for a mimo wireless broadcast system where one receiver harvests energy and other receivers decode information ,",
    "transmission strategy is designed for maximal information rate versus energy transfer  @xcite . with multiple single - antenna transmitters that send independent messages to their respective receivers ,",
    "collaborative energy beamforming is required for wireless power transfer  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there have been several studies of joint wireless information and energy transfer in interference channels  @xcite .",
    "because the interference has different impacts on the performances of information processing and energy harvesting at the receivers , the transmission strategy is a critical issue . in a @xmath0-user mimo interference channel ,",
    "the transmitters transferring energy exploit a rank - one energy beamforming , and an iterative algorithm can be used to optimize the transmit covariance matrices  @xcite . in another @xmath0-user mimo scenario ,",
    "the total transmit power of the users is minimized by jointly designing transmit beamformers , power splitters , and receive filters  @xcite . when a multi - antenna transmitter communicates with its information receiver",
    ", it can intentionally focus the transmitted power to the nearby rf energy harvesters with a guarantee on its information rate  @xcite .    in this paper , a multi - user transmission problem",
    "is considered in mimo interference channels with rf energy harvesting requirements .",
    "each transmitter can estimate its user channel and measure the combined interference and noise .",
    "however , the signaling between different users is very limited so that collaborative beamforming or joint design of transmit beamformers is not possible . instead",
    ", the transmitters compete by designing signal transmit covariance matrices to increase own information rates , subject to the transmit power constraints and the energy harvesting requirements .",
    "each transmitter knows the channel to the energy harvesters , however , it does not know the channels from other transmitters to the energy harvesters .",
    "the multi - user transmission problem is formulated as a strategic game . in a non - cooperative game , with a measurement of the combined interference and noise ,",
    "the best response of a transmitter is to design the transmit covariance matrix according to the multi - level water - filling solution",
    ". a pure - strategy nash equilibrium exists .",
    "however , it may not be unique or pareto - efficient . the best - response dynamic may cycle and not converge to a nash equilibrium . in a cooperative game , the sum information rate is maximized , and the optimal point of rates can be found that approaches the pareto front  @xcite .",
    "there is no need to estimate the proportion of the harvested energy from each transmitter .",
    "rather , the transmitters bargain over the unit - reward of the energy contribution to the harvesters .",
    "the individual utility function of the game is constructed from an approximation of the information rate such that the problem of network utility maximization can be decomposed and the bargaining process implemented distributively . with moderate",
    "signaling among the users , the bargaining process quickly generates a point of rates that is close to the pareto front .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    ", a system model is provided for the multi - user mimo communications , and the rate maximization problem is formulated with the rf energy harvesting requirement . in section  [ sec : noncooperative_game ] , a non - cooperative game is proposed for the multi - user transmissions over interference channels . the best - response strategy is based on a multi - level water - filling solution . in section  [ sec : cooperativegame ] , a cooperative game is proposed for the multi - user transmissions .",
    "the transmitters bargain over the unit - reward of the energy contribution while maximizing the network information rate . in section  [ sec : numericalresults ] , simulation results verify the transmission algorithms and show that the distributed bargaining offers superior performance . finally , conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "pairs of wireless communication transmitter and receiver as well as an energy receiver.,width=192 ]    in the vicinity of the passive rf energy harvester , there are @xmath0 pairs of wireless communication transmitter and receiver that share the same radio channel resources of time and frequency ( figure  [ fig : systemmodel ] ) .",
    "each transmitter has @xmath1 antennas and each receiver has @xmath2 antennas .",
    "the passive rf energy harvester has a single antenna through which it can harvest the energy for the attached iot device or transmit through backscattering  @xcite . in sections  [ sec : model ] through [ sec : distributedbargaining ] , we develop the wireless transmission technique considering only one rf energy harvester .",
    "the transmission methods will be extended to the scenario of multiple rf energy harvesters in section  [ sec : multipleharvesters ] .",
    "suppose that the wireless transmissions of the communication systems are narrowband over quasi - static fading channels .",
    "in the baseband equivalent model , the signal transmitted at transmitter @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "the signal received at receiver @xmath3 is @xmath5 , which is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the normalized user channel from transmitter @xmath3 to its intended receiver , @xmath8 is the normalized interference channel from transmitter @xmath9 to receiver @xmath3 , and @xmath10 is a zero - mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian noise vector with @xmath11 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath12 contains both noise and possible interference generated by the backscatter device . in this paper , without loss of generality , it is assumed that @xmath13 for clarity .",
    "the energy harvester ( or the rf back scatterer ) does not need to convert the received signal from the rf band to the baseband .",
    "nevertheless , the rf power is proportional to the power of the baseband signal .",
    "therefore , we use the baseband equivalent model to reveal the rf energy harvesting effects as well .",
    "the baseband received signal at the energy harvester is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the conjugate channel vector from transmitter @xmath3 to the energy harvester , and @xmath16 is the background noise .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the covariance matrix of signal @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "it is assumed that the gaussian codebook with infinitely many codewords is used for the symbols and the expectation is taken over the entire codebook .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 is zero - mean circularly symmetric complex gaussian with @xmath20 .",
    "the covariance matrix is hermitian positive semidefinite that is denoted as @xmath21 .",
    "the transmit power at transmitter @xmath3 is limited by its power constraint @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the collection of the transmit covariance matrices of the @xmath25 transmitters other than transmitter @xmath3 .",
    "from an information - theoretical perspective  @xcite , the maximum information rate of transmitter - receiver pair @xmath3 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the multi - user interference and noise as @xmath28    the received power at the rf energy harvester is the harvested energy normalized by the baseband symbol period .",
    "it can be written as @xmath29 = \\zeta \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{k } } \\mathbf{g}_{i}^{h } \\mathbf{q}_{i } \\mathbf{g}_{i}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a constant that indicates energy conversion efficiency .",
    "it is implied in that , at the energy harvester , the noise power is negligible compared with the received signal power .",
    "this makes sense because we do not consider any energy that can be harvested from noise .    for each communication receiver ,",
    "the signals transmitted from other transmitters become the interference .",
    "the received signals from other transmitters should be minimized .",
    "in contrast , for the energy harvester , all of the transmitters are energy contributors .",
    "the combined received signal power should be maximized . at transmitter @xmath31 ,",
    "the design objective for the transmit covariance matrix @xmath17 is to maximize the achievable information rate while satisfying the individual transmit power constraint and the overall energy harvesting requirement .",
    "the optimization problem can be formulated as ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 indicates the energy harvesting requirement such that @xmath35 is the minimum required harvested energy during a symbol period .",
    "because of the objective function and the last constraint of problem @xmath36 , the design of transmit covariance matrix @xmath17 is coupled with those of other transmitters .",
    "of the @xmath0 wireless communication users in the network , each user designs the transmit signal by regulating its covariance matrix to boost the maximum information rate .",
    "each user s transmission is within the transmit power limit and the overall radiated energy reaching the rf energy harvester should meet the energy harvesting requirement . for each transmitter , modifying the transmit covariance matrix affects the interference to other receivers hence changing the maximum information rates of other users .",
    "it is a competition among the wireless users ; each tends its own maximum information rate .",
    "therefore , the problem of simultaneous wireless transmissions can be formulated as a strategic game  @xcite , which is denoted as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the finite set of the @xmath0 transmitters as the game players , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the set of strategies available to player @xmath3 .",
    "the overall strategy set of all the players is @xmath41 .",
    "the utility function of player @xmath3 ( @xmath40 ) is @xmath42 .",
    "the transmit covariance matrix @xmath17 is the game strategy of player @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath43 . in this paper",
    ", we address the general case in which each transmitter can freely adjust its transmit covariance matrix .",
    "for some special cases with space - time coding or confined transmission , other strategies may be adopted .",
    "for example , if the transmission is confined to the eigenmodes of the channel matrix , each transmitter can adopt the power allocation on the channel eigenmodes as the game strategy .",
    "the maximum information rate of player @xmath3 is used as its utility function , i.e. , @xmath44 .    with all competition but no cooperation among the players ,",
    "this strategic game is a non - cooperative game .",
    "a steady state of the non - cooperative game is the nash equilibrium ( ne ) , where no player can improve his utility by unilaterally changing his own strategy . in game @xmath45",
    ", the ne can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the transmit covariance matrix for user @xmath3 at the ne and @xmath48 is the collection of the transmit covariance matrices of all of the other users except user @xmath3 at the ne .",
    "when @xmath24 is fixed in problem @xmath36 , the objective function is concave and the constraints are convex in the space of positive semidefinite matrices .",
    "therefore , problem @xmath36 is a convex optimization problem for which efficient numerical optimization is possible  @xcite . in game @xmath45 ,",
    "every strategy set @xmath39 is compact and convex , the utility function @xmath49 is a continuous function in the profile of strategies @xmath50 and concave in @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the game has at least one pure - strategy ne  @xcite .",
    "the ne is a strategy profile for which each player s strategy is a best response to the other players strategies .",
    "given @xmath24 , transmitter @xmath3 optimizes the transmit covariance matrix @xmath17 as its best response by solving the following optimization problem @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a portion of the energy harvesting requirement imposed on transmitter @xmath3 .",
    "it can be acquired , for example , by shutting off user @xmath3 s transmission alone .",
    "suppose that the rf energy harvester can measure the harvested power ( or energy over a symbol period ) and feed it back to the transmitters through the internet . as the energy harvester is attached to an iot device ,",
    "this is feasible . transmitter",
    "@xmath3 turns on and off its transmission and observes the difference of the harvested energy from the feedback . if there is mechanism to ensure that it is unlikely that multiple transmitters shut off at the same time , transmitter @xmath3 can estimate the minimum energy that it should contribute to the rf energy harvester .",
    "transmitter @xmath3 can estimate its user channel @xmath53 through pilot signals and feedback , and it can measure the multi - user interference and noise @xmath27 without the need to acquire individual @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "the objective function of the optimization problem is @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "a singular value decomposition on @xmath58 gives @xmath59 . with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",

    "equality in hadamard s inequality is achieved if and only if the positive definite matrix is diagonal .",
    "therefore , the optimal @xmath63 of has to be diagonal . with a diagonal matrix @xmath63 ,",

    "finally , transmitter @xmath3 solves local problem @xmath70 with the optimal transmit covariance matrix @xmath47 .",
    "this is the best response of user @xmath3 to other users transmissions regarding maximum information rate .",
    "as discussed before , game @xmath45 has at least one pure - strategy ne .",
    "if player @xmath107 , has a single best response to each strategy profile @xmath24 of the other players , the @xmath0 strategies at the ne can be put in the collection of best - response equations .",
    "unfortunately , each player s best response can not be expressed in a single equation .",
    "the ne can only be approached by best - response iterations among the players .",
    "the network iterations can be done with asynchronous player updates .    without the energy harvesting requirement ,",
    "a similar multiuser mimo transmission game is addressed  @xcite .",
    "the water - filling operator is interpreted as a projection onto a proper polyhedral set .",
    "then , a set of sufficient conditions are derived that guarantee the uniqueness of the ne and the global convergence of the distributed asynchronous water - filling algorithms .",
    "the sufficient conditions are based on the user channel @xmath108 and the interference channels @xmath109 . in our problem , the uniqueness conditions would also depend on the vector channels @xmath110 to the rf energy harvester .",
    "in general , the ne may not be unique .",
    "also , the best - response dynamic may cycle in the game and not converge to a ne  @xcite .",
    "there are two practical concerns of the non - cooperative game of user transmissions .",
    "first , the proportion of energy contribution imposed on each transmitter may not be optimal .",
    "user @xmath3 uses the transmission on - and - off process and the energy harvester feedback to estimate the partial minimum energy requirement @xmath52 .",
    "it gives little consideration to what is the best distribution of energy contribution among the transmitters .",
    "furthermore , if other transmitters currently contribute little to the rf energy harvester and the energy harvesting requirement is harsh , user @xmath3 may just give up transmission by not having a feasible solution of its local optimization problem .",
    "second , even though there exists a pure ne of the non - cooperative game , it may not be a globally optimal solution for the user information rates .",
    "the ne point is not necessarily pareto - efficient and may not be desirable of the network .",
    "therefore , we do not further pursue the uniqueness condition of the ne or the convergence condition of the non - cooperative game .    for multiple players in a strategic game ,",
    "the optimal network outcome depends on competition as well as cooperation .",
    "each player is an autonomous agent , but negotiation with moderate signaling among the players is allowed .",
    "transmitter @xmath3 of the game bargain over its share of energy contribution @xmath52 to the rf energy harvester while maximizing its information rate @xmath111 .",
    "the goal of the cooperative game is to achieve the user information rates that approach the pareto optimal rates .    for game @xmath45 ,",
    "the strategies of all the players @xmath112 are intertwined to satisfy the energy harvesting requirement .",
    "therefore , the players need to cooperate with each other for a good distribution of this requirement . as the transmitters bargain over the assignments of the energy requirement , a bargaining problem can be leveraged to analyze player cooperation  @xcite .",
    "game @xmath45 can be regarded as a bargain among the @xmath0 transmitters over their shares of energy contribution to the rf energy harvester . to be fair",
    ", the unit - reward of the harvested energy should be the same regardless of which transmitter does the rf radiation come from . in our cooperative game , we set the disagreement point at zero",
    ". therefore , any rational player tends to cooperate with others  @xcite .",
    "several network utility functions can be selected for the cooperative game . as long as the network utility function is a quasi - concave and strict increasing function of the individual utilities , there is a unique bargaining solution .",
    "for example , the product of the individual utilities can be chosen as the network utility function .",
    "it is called the nash product and the bargaining solution is the nash bargaining solution . in our problem , instead of the nash bargaining solution , we are interested in finding the utilitarian solution that maximizes the sum of the individual utilities . the utilitarian solution is a pareto - efficient solution .",
    "it is directly related to the maximum sum rate of the network with some tradeoff in rate fairness among the users .    for game @xmath45 ,",
    "finding the utilitarian solution that maximizes the network utility can be formulated as the following optimization problem .",
    "@xmath113 in the cooperative game , the distribution of the energy harvesting requirement is not pre - determined .",
    "the players adjust their transmit strategies to maximize the network utility as well as reach an agreement of allocating the energy contributions . in general , maximizing the sum information rate is a non - convex problem and is hard to solve .      as the transmitters play the cooperative game , the strategy of transmitter @xmath3 ( @xmath40 ) is the transmit covariance matrix @xmath17 . with problem @xmath114 on the maximization of the sum information rate , the players can bargain over the last constraint , i.e. , the energy harvesting requirement .",
