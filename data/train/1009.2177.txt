    "the existence of states beyond the constituent quark model ( cqm ) has been speculated about almost since the introduction of colour@xcite . due to the gluon self - coupling via colour - charge , so - called hybrid mesons , @xmath7 states with an admixture of gluons , and glueballs , states with no quark content , consisting of ( constituent ) gluons only , are allowed within quantum chromodynamics . while light glueballs would not be observable as pure states , as they would mix with ordinary @xmath7-mesons , hybrid mesons ( @xmath8 ) are promising candidates to search for resonances beyond the cqm .",
    "especially , as the lowest mass candidate is predicted@xcite to have exotic quantum numbers of spin , parity and charge conjugation @xmath9 not attainable by ordinary @xmath7 states , and a mass between 1.3 and 2.2gev / c@xmath10 .",
    "two experimental @xmath11 hybrid candidates in the light - quark sector have been reported in the past in different decay channels , the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 .",
    "in particular the resonant nature of the @xmath14 decay channel of the latter is highly disputed@xcite .",
    "compass has started to shed new light on the puzzle by the observation of an exotic @xmath11 signal in the 2004 data , consistent with the famous @xmath13 ; it shows a clean resonant behaviour@xcite .",
    "the compass spectrometer@xcite at the cern sps features electromagnetic calorimetry and a ring imaging cherenkov detector . photon detection in a wide angular range with high resolution is crucial for decay channels involving @xmath15 , @xmath4 or @xmath16 , and the rich allows for final state particle identification .",
    "a good separation of pions from kaons enables the study of kaonic final states",
    ". not only production of strangeness with the pion beam can thus be studied but also kaon diffraction , using the incoming kaon beam .",
    "the compass data taken in 2008/09 with a 190gev / c @xmath17 or @xmath18 beam provide thus excellent opportunity for simultaneous observation of new states in various decay modes within the same experiment . moreover",
    ", the data contain subsets with different beam projectiles and targets , allowing for systematic studies not only of diffractive but also central production and primakoff reactions .",
    "an important cross - check of all analyses is the test for isospin symmetry in the observed spectra .",
    "the @xmath14 decay channel of the @xmath13 for example , can be studied in two modes of 3@xmath1 final states , @xmath19 ( charged ) and @xmath20 ( neutral ) , respectively .",
    "depending on the underlying isobars , the relative contribution should follow isospin conservation .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig : pwa2008 ] . a first , preliminary partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) of main waves in diffractively produced 3@xmath1 events",
    "has been performed for both modes , for details see@xcite . to compensate different statistics , the wave intensities shown are normalised to the well - known @xmath14 decay of the @xmath21 to make them comparable .",
    "we find similar intensities for the @xmath14 decay , whereas a suppression factor of two is observed for the wave decaying into @xmath22 as expected due to the clebsch - gordon coefficients .",
    "further ongoing analyses involving neutrals cover @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( search for the @xmath12 and lightest @xmath25 glueball candidate ) as well as @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 final states ( accessible isobars : @xmath29 ) , for which compass has recorded significantly higher statistics with respect to previous experiments , covering all spin - exotic meson decay channels in the light quark sector reported in the past .",
    "final states with strangeness are interesting for both , the glueball search in central production as well as diffractive production of hybrids .",
    "exemplary we show the @xmath30 subsystems out of the @xmath6 system again for two modes , @xmath31 and @xmath32 final states , respectively .",
    "both spectra show a clear structure around the expected @xmath33 , for details see@xcite .",
    "further ongoing analyses cover the @xmath34 system as well as kaon diffraction into @xmath35 final states ( pwa under preparation ) .",
    "compass has collected data with high - intensity hadron beams ( @xmath36 ) on nuclear and liquid hydrogen targets .",
    "the newly taken data sample exceeds the world data by a factor of 10 - 100 , allowing to address open issues in light - mesons spectroscopy at good accuracy , even in the mass region beyond 2gev / c@xmath10 .",
    "this work is supported by the bmbf ( germany ) , particularly the `` nutzungsinitiative cern '' .",
