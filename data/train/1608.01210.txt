    "we are concerned with the development of the non - conforming virtual element method ( vem ) for the stokes problem in the unknown fields @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfying @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a polygonal or polyhedral domain in @xmath4 , @xmath5 with boundary @xmath6",
    ". we will refer to @xmath0 and @xmath1 as _ velocity _ and _ pressure _ , respectively .",
    "historically , the first non - conforming finite element space dates back to the work of crouzeix and raviart in  @xcite .",
    "their method provides a low - order accurate approximation of the velocity field of the stokes equations on triangular meshes based on linear polynomials .",
    "later on , higher - order accurate methods were proposed by fortin and soulie  @xcite , and crouzeix and falk @xcite , respectively , by using finite element spaces based on polynomials of degree @xmath7 and @xmath8 on triangles .",
    "the functions in these finite element spaces are continuous on a discrete set of points located at the internal mesh edges .",
    "these points are the roots of the one - dimensional @xmath9-order legendre polynomials defined over the edges and can be used as the nodes of the @xmath9 gauss - legendre quadrature rule .",
    "this minimal continuity requirement ensures the optimal convergence rate ; see , for instance ,  @xcite .",
    "the construction of the non - conforming elements for the stokes problem has been recently generalized on triangles in @xcite to consider polynomials of any degree @xmath10 , thus resulting in the so - called family of gauss - legendre non - conforming methods .",
    "robust a posteriori estimates for such schemes can be found in @xcite .",
    "a major drawback of the non - conforming gauss - legendre elements is that the space construction for even @xmath11 differs from that of odd @xmath11 .",
    "this feature also affects the classical low - order cases for @xmath12 , i.e. , the formulation of the non - conforming spaces for @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xcite is not the same as for @xmath7 in  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the non - conforming formulation to elements other than triangles in two and three dimensions is quite a hard task due to the difficulty of the construction of the shape functions for such elements .",
    "for example , successful attempts in this direction are found for quadrilaterals , tetrahedra and hexahedra in  @xcite . instead , the construction of the non - conforming virtual element space for the stokes equations that we present in this paper is straightforward for any polynomial degree regardless of its parity , and is the same for elements with very general geometric shape in two and three space dimensions .",
    "the vem was first introduced as a @xmath15-conforming formulation for the poisson equation with constant coefficients in  @xcite .",
    "the non - conforming formulation for the same problem was developed later in  @xcite . in both formulations ,",
    "the trial and test functions are defined implicitly on each mesh element as the solution of a boundary value problem and never explicitly constructed in practice , hence the name `` _ _ virtual _ _ '' . in view of obtaining a _ computable _ and",
    "_ accurate _ virtual formulation , two essential ingredients are sought for the virtual element space : @xmath16 it must contain a space of polynomials up to a given degree ; @xmath17 orthogonal @xmath18 and @xmath19 projections of virtual functions onto the polynomial sub - space must be computable just using the degrees of freedom .",
    "properties @xmath16-@xmath17 make possible to avoid the explicit construction of the shape functions and allows us to formulate and implement the method on very general polygonal and polyhedral meshes .",
    "these features are inherited from the mimetic finite difference ( mfd ) method  @xcite , which can be seen as a precursor .",
    "a conforming low order mfd method for the steady stokes problem on general polygonal and polyhedral meshes is found in  @xcite , and a higher order mfd method equivalent to the non - conforming vem in  @xcite is found in  @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop the non - conforming vem for the weak form of  - ( see  - in the next section ) that is suitable for very general mesh partitioning of @xmath3 in polygons and polyhedra . as is standard in the finite element setting , the vem approximation of - proposed in this work is based on the construction of a pair of finite element spaces satisfying the inf - sup condition ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the major features of this vem are : @xmath16 each component of the velocity is locally approximated by the non - conforming virtual element space of order @xmath11 that contains the subspace of polynomials of degree at most @xmath11 and is globally non - conforming in the sense specified in section  [ sect : virtual : element : framework ] , see also  @xcite .",
    "the pressure is locally approximated by polynomials of degree at most @xmath20 , and is globally discontinuous ; @xmath17 gradient and divergence are approximated by their projection onto polynomials of degree @xmath20 .",
    "both projections are computable exactly using only the degrees of freedom of the vem .",
    "therefore , the divergence - free nature of the stokes velocity is reproduced in the virtual framework by enforcing the divergence - free condition on the velocity approximation in a weak sense on each element .",
    "moreover , the degree of the polynomials determines the accuracy ( convergence rate ) of the vem ; @xmath21 the well - posedness of the vem is ensured through an additional stabilization term in the discrete weak formulation , which is computable using only the degrees of freedom of the vem and is zero when applied to polynomials ; @xmath22 the vem allows for the use of mesh partitionings of @xmath3 with polygonal elements in 2d or polyhedral elements in 3d of arbitrary shape provided that a few typical shape regularity conditions are satisfied .",
    "the formulation of the method is the same in 2d and 3d and for any cell shape .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this feature follows from the nonconforming nature of the formulation , since the virtual conforming formulation , which also holds for general meshes , has to be constructed hierarchically in the space dimensions .",
    "a number of relevant numerical approaches for the stokes problem have been proposed in recent years .",
    "the vem framework has already been applied to the streamline formulation of the stokes equation in  @xcite , a pseudo - stress velocity formulation can be found in  @xcite , and a divergence free virtual approach can be found in  @xcite . among the recent developments in discontinuous galerkin methods , it is worth mentioning  @xcite , the hybridized discontinuous galerkin  @xcite , and , concerning polygonal meshes , the hybrid high order method  @xcite and the weak galerkin method  @xcite .",
    "a comparison between these different approaches is surely worth of investigation and will be the subject of further investigations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : stokes : problem ] we state the steady stokes problem in weak form and introduce the vem as a galerkin method . in section  [",
