    "the gravitational accretion of an ideal gas onto a compact object has been applied across a wide range of astrophysical topics , including the growth of supermassive black holes and associated feedback in agns @xcite , accretion onto young star clusters as an explanation for the formation of ultraluminous x - ray sources @xcite and accretion onto gas giant planets around evolved stars @xcite .",
    "a common application is that of wind - fed x - ray binaries , beginning with the original suggestion by @xcite that the x - ray luminosity of cyg x-3 is driven by the gravitational capture of material in the stellar wind of the companion star .",
    "more recently , wind - fed accretion onto neutron stars has been invoked to explain the behavior of supergiant fast x - ray transients @xcite .    while the basic theory for gravitational accretion onto a moving star was described more than 70 years ago by @xcite , from a theoretical standpoint we know surprisingly little about its stability and temporal behavior .",
    "the simplified case of planar accretion in two dimensions is known to be unstable to the growth of small perturbations from a steady state @xcite , leading to accretion through a quasi - keplerian accretion disk .",
    "whether similar behavior exists in three dimensions remains an open question .",
    "previous 3d simulations have observed rotational flow around the surface of the accretor , but were limited by the computational resources necessary for small accretor radii and sufficiently high resolutions . in this paper",
    ", we describe the results of high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations that probe the question : is three - dimensional hoyle - lyttleton accretion stable , or is the axisymmetry of the flow broken through rotational flow or violent flip - flop behavior ?    a thorough review of hoyle - lyttleton accretion ( hla ) theory and subsequent numerical studies is given by @xcite .",
    "we provide only a brief synopsis here .",
    "hoyle and lyttleton derived a formula for the accretion radius of a point mass @xmath0 moving at a speed @xmath1 through a uniform medium of density @xmath2 :    @xmath3    gas approaching the star with an impact parameter less than @xmath4 will collide on an accretion line behind the star and will be left with insufficient kinetic energy to escape the gravitational potential of the star . from this , @xcite posited that the mass accretion rate is given by the mass flux through a circle of radius @xmath4 far upstream :    @xmath5    there have been many numerical simulations of hla in 2d , beginning with the axisymmetric steady - state solutions of @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to observe what they called the flip - flop instability , which was also seen by @xcite .",
    "flip - flop behavior is characterized by an accretion wake that oscillates between alternately rotating disk states with a brief transitory phase in which the disk is flushed into the accretor .",
    "this non - axisymmetric instability has been subsequently seen in numerous hydrodynamic simulations of two - dimensional planar accretion @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the flip - flop instability was a true overstability rather than a consequence of numerical effects , and that the growth rate increases as the radius of the accretor is decreased .",
    "the relevance of instabilities in two - dimensional hla to the temporal behavior of accreting x - ray sources has been debated since the discovery of the flip - flop instability .",
    "given that accretion - powered x - ray sources in be - type binary systems are expected to accrete from a planar disk expelled by the companion be star , attention has focused on the relationship of the flip - flop instability to these be - type x - ray pulsars . @xcite interpreted the recurrent flares in exo 2030 + 375 in terms of the episodic accretion resulting from the flip - flop instability .",
    "@xcite argued that the variable accretion torques associated with the flip - flop instability may explain the erratic spin behavior in these systems .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this disk accretion mode exists in 3d .",
    "the best simulations to date of 3d hla were a series of studies using nested cartesian grids @xcite .",
    "the accretion in these 3d studies was found to be unstable , although not as violent as the flip - flop behavior found in 2d planar flow .",
    "nonetheless , some of the 3d models reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ra ) did exhibit a quasi - periodic swinging of the accretion shock leading to brief epochs of strong rotational flow near the accretor .",
    "this behavior was particularly evident for the models with the smallest accretors .",
    "the models with an accretor radius of @xmath6 ( s6 and s8 ) exhibited rotational flow near the surface of the accretor , but the flow velocities were sub - keplerian by more than a factor of two and the rotational flow pattern lasted for no more than 10 orbits .",
    "however , it is important to note that these simulations were of relatively low spatial resolution and limited to relatively large radii for the accreting star . although these 3d runs used nested cartesian grids to improve the resolution near the accreting star , each nested grid was only 32 zones on a side .",
    "their best resolution amounted to 6.4 zones across the radius of the accretor .",
    "this is very low compared to that used in many of the 2d simulations exhibiting flip - flop behavior ( blondin & pope 2009 used a resolution 6 times finer ) .",
    "moreover , these simulations were limited to an accretor radius of 0.05 @xmath4 ( and one short run at 0.01 @xmath4 ) due to limited computational resources .",
    "this limitation is important because the growth rate of the flip - flop instability in 2d increases dramatically with decreasing accretor radius @xcite , with long phases of quasi - disk accretion only occurring for much smaller accretors ( 0.0037 @xmath4 ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe two ( @xmath7 = 0.05 and 0.01 ) high - resolution simulations of three - dimensional hla . the parameters of these models were chosen to mimic two of the simulations described by in which they found time - dependent , non - axisymmetric behavior .",
    "the simulations presented here use the vh-1 hydrodynamics code , which is the same code described in @xcite .",
    "vh-1 uses a lagrange - remap formulation of the piecewise parabolic method @xcite to solve the euler equations for the inviscid flow of a compressible ideal gas .",
    "the piecewise parabolic method is an explicit godunov method that offers high - order accuracy ( 3rd - order in space , 2nd - order in time ) .",
    "the extension to 3d is enabled by the use of a yin - yang overset grid as described by @xcite . given that one needs to follow the accretion flow over orders of magnitude in distance from the central object , a spherical coordinate system is the natural choice for accretion studies .",
    "unfortunately in 3d this choice introduces a coordinate singularity associated with the polar axis that creates severe problems with the courant limit on the time step in explicit methods .",
    "it also results in unwanted artifacts associated with advection near the axis .",
    "the yin - yang approach solves these problems by using two spherical polar grids aligned by 90 degrees with respect to each other .",
    "the polar regions of one grid are replaced by the equatorial region of the other , with overlapping regions used to implement boundary conditions in the angular directions .",
    "we use yin and yang grids with dimensions of 252x72x216 zones , which when combined result in a grid circumference of 288 zones .",
    "we use a non - uniform radial grid , keeping @xmath8 roughly constant throughout the grid .",
    "this grid enables us to simulate the downstream behavior of the accretion shock extending to @xmath9 while still offering a resolution near the accretor comparable to that of the highest - resolution 2d simulations published to date . the number of radial zones was chosen to produce a value of @xmath10 , comparable to the angular spacing of @xmath11 .",
    "this ensures approximately cubic zones throughout the grid . for the @xmath12",
    "run we extended the radial grid to 324 zones to keep the same value of @xmath8 .",
    "we orient our grid so that the incoming gas flows toward the origin from the + x direction , such that the projected face of the yin - yang grid is laterally symmetric ( figure [ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "this places the accretion wake almost entirely in the yang grid , and minimizes the impact of the grid seams on the subsonic post - shock flow . during preliminary runs",
    ", we observed the formation of small , low - entropy streamers that originated in the low - density stagnation region of the post - shock flow and propagated upstream toward the accretor .",
    "these streamers would occasionally wrap partly around the accretor , disturbing the flow slightly as they were accreted and causing minor motion of the wake .",
    "the origin of these streamers appears to lie in the seams between the yin and yang grids , as reorienting the flow so that the seams are no longer present in the accretion wake causes them to vanish .",
    "the inner boundary of our simulation represents the surface of the accretor . in order to minimize the impact of this inner boundary on the accretion flow",
    ", we imposed an absorbing boundary condition by setting the density and pressure to very small values inside of this boundary .",
    "this is similar to the inner boundary condition used by @xcite , , @xcite , and @xcite . to allow gas to flow unimpeded off the grid downstream of the accretor",
    ", we implement a zero - gradient outer boundary downstream , but with the added condition that gas may not flow inward onto the grid once it has escaped .    in order to monitor the accretion of mass and angular momentum",
    ", we record the total mass and angular momentum crossing the inner boundary over each time step . by averaging these values periodically over small intervals of time ,",
    "we are able to obtain a measure of the mass and angular momentum accretion rates .",
    "to initialize the 3d grid , our approach is to begin with 2d axisymmetric simulations on a spherical grid .",
    "these 2d simulations are evolved for several flow times to allow them to settle into a steady state ( if such a state exists ) , after which the evolved 2d solution is mapped onto the 3d yin - yang grid .",
    "the 3d grid uses the exact same radial grid as in the 2d simulation , avoiding the need for interpolation in the radial direction .",
    "moreover , the 2d and 3d codes share the exact same fortran code for hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "this procedure is meant to minimize any transients generated by the initial conditions on the 3d grid .",
    "starting from a steady state allows us to investigate the origin of any instability by watching small perturbations grow over time .",
    "it also allows us to avoid the relatively long initial evolution that previous researchers had to compute while waiting for large - amplitude transients to die away .",
    "simulation parameters are chosen to match models s8",
    "( s6 was the same model but lower resolution ) and t10 of , with an upstream mach number of three , a ratio of specific heats of 5/3 , and accretor radii of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . assuming a strictly uniform plane - parallel flow at the outer boundary has the adverse effect of coupling the behavior of the flow at the accretor boundary to the outer radius of the grid because the outer boundary is not truly an infinite distance away .",
    "to more closely match the true hla problem , we calculate the velocity , density , and pressure ( assuming isentropic flow ) at the outer edge of the grid by solving for the ballistic trajectory from infinity @xcite .",
    "with the larger accretor ( @xmath16 , corresponding to s8 in ) , we observed a remarkably stable flow over 60 flow times .",
    "after interpolating the two - dimensional axisymmetric solution onto the 3d grid , the shock cone adjusts slightly over a few flow times . by a time of @xmath17",
    "the mass accretion rate has settled to a constant value of @xmath18 , as shown in figure [ fig : largemdot ] .",
    "this is consistent with the average value of @xmath19 reported by , given the large variability seen in their models .",
    "in contrast , the mass accretion rate in our large accretor model varied by less than 0.02% once it settled down to the steady - state value .",
    "these small variations about the average could be attributed to numerical noise behind the steady bow shock .",
    ".,width=317 ]    this steady flow retains the original axisymmetry to a high degree .",
    "the maximum specific angular momentum of the accreted gas never exceeds 0.05% of the specific angular momentum of a keplerian orbit at the radius of the accretor .",
    "this axisymmetry is illustrated in figure [ fig : symmetry ] , which shows the gas pressure in a 2d plane normal to the incoming flow but downstream of the accretor .",
    "downstream of the accretor illustrates the highly axisymmetric nature of the downstream flow .",
    "the incoming flow is moving down the x - axis .",
    "a portion of the bow shock ( on the yin grid ) is is also shown .",
    "the surface of the accreting star is shown with the leading face colored dark red to represent low mass flux and the back side colored yellow to represent high ( inward ) mass flux .",
    "( a color figure is available in the online journal.),width=317 ]        the structure of this hla flow is in reasonable agreement with time - independent , axisymmetric calculations @xcite .",
    "the local mach number of the flow is shown in figure [ fig : machlarge ] , illustrating an upstream subsonic stagnation region , and a downstream , supersonic accretion flow .",
    "the region between the accretor surface and the stand - off bowshock is highly subsonic .",
    "the high pressure of this region results in a relatively low mass accretion rate through the upstream half of the accretor surface .",
    "in contrast , the inward accretion flow on the downstream side of the accretor reaches a mach number of @xmath20 . most of the mass accretion occurs preferentially on the downstream side of the accretor ; the local mass flux on the leading side is three times lower than that on the downstream side . at equilibrium ,",
    "the bow shock has a stand - off distance of @xmath21 .",
    "while the opening angle of the bowshock is ill - defined in the vicinity of the accretor , at a distance of several @xmath4 downstream the opening half - angle gradually decreases to a roughly constant @xmath22 .",
    "this is noticeably larger than the theoretical prediction of @xmath23 for a mach number of @xmath24 .",
    "( petrich et .",
    "1988 also noted a larger opening angle ) .",
    "our second simulation reduced the accretor size to a value of @xmath25 , the same as in the t10 simulation of ra . at the time , ra s simulation lacked the duration to draw appropriate conclusions , although it displayed behavior that supported their hypothesized trend of more volatile behavior in @xmath26 and @xmath27 with decreasing accretor size .",
    "our simulation extends to 17 flow times , roughly three times longer than in and long enough to see the long term behavior unrelated to the initial conditions .",
    "the general structure of the accretion flow , illustrated in figure [ fig : machsmall ] , remains similar to that seen in the larger accretor .",
    "the shock front is located at an upstream distance of @xmath28 , significantly farther out than in the large - accretor simulation .",
    "the downstream opening half - angle is @xmath29 .",
    "again the mass accretion occurs preferentially on the downstream side , with mach numbers approaching 1.5 .",
    ".,width=317 ]    the most noticeable difference in this flow is the presence of a breathing mode , in which the accretion wake oscillates in the direction of the original flow while remaining axisymmetric .",
    "this oscillation begins immediately , and while it persists throughout the simulation , its amplitude remains finite and the large - scale structure of the wake remains undisrupted .",
    "the stand - off distance of the bow shock varies quasi - periodically with an amplitude of about 10% of the steady - state value and an oscillation period slightly smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "the streaks in figure [ fig : machsmall ] betray the unsteady nature of the accretion flow onto the small accretor in contrast to the very steady flow onto the large accretor .",
    "the mass accretion rate , plotted in figure [ fig : smallmdot ] , follows the same general evolution as for the large accretor .",
    "the accretion rate initially decreases until settling into a constant average after about ten flow times . in this case",
    "the late - time average is about @xmath19 , somewhat lower than for the larger accretor .",
    "the main difference is an oscillation imposed on top of this long term behavior .",
    "these oscillations in the mass accretion rate have the same period as the oscillations in the shock stand - off distance , hence we attribute both to the axisymmetric breathing mode .",
    "the phase difference between mass accretion and shock position is such that the brief minima in the mass accretion rate corresponds to when the leading edge of the bowshock is falling back in toward the accretor .",
    "although the flow is no longer steady , it remains highly axisymmetric .",
    "the accreted angular momentum is about an order of magnitude larger than in the large accretor simulations , but the values remain relatively small and there is no preferred orientation of the rotational flow . even with the smaller radius of accretor surface , the instantaneous value of the specific angular momentum of accreting gas remains less than 5% of the specific angular momentum of a keplerian orbit at the accretor surface .",
    "we present high - resolution simulations of hoyle - lyttleton accretion that demonstrate that the axisymmetry of hla is remarkably stable . for both simulations we observe no rotational flow in the vicinity of the accretor , as indicated by the small amount of specific angular momentum in the accreted gas . for the large accretor case ( @xmath31 ) the mass accretion rate relaxes to a constant value of @xmath32 , with variations no greater than 0.02% .",
    "decreasing the accretor size to @xmath33 introduces a quasi - periodic axisymmetric breathing mode .",
    "this mode appears almost immediately and reaches a quasi - stable oscillation within 10 @xmath30 .",
    "the mass accretion rate is modulated by the oscillation of the bow shock , but maintains an average of @xmath34 .",
    "the oscillations occur with a period of @xmath35 .",
    "this is decidedly larger than the acoustic period ( the time for a sound wave to travel from the bowshock to the accretor and back ) , which we calculate to be @xmath36 .",
    "this breathing mode does not affect axisymmetry of the flow .",
    "our results are dramatically different from those of ra , who used a similar numerical algorithm but a different grid geometry ( nested cartesian grids versus overset spherical grids ) with substantially lower spatial resolution .",
    "their simulations with @xmath37 and @xmath38 both displayed quiescent periods broken by brief transient disk - like flow .",
    "the larger accretor simulation in particular displayed an anti - correlation between the mass accretion rate and the specific angular momentum of the accreted gas : during the active periods when the accreting gas had a larger specific angular momentum there was a drop ( by a factor of 2 or 3 ) in the mass accretion rate .",
    "this behavior was not as dramatic as the flip - flop flow observed in 2d hla simulations .",
    "in contrast , our simulations do not display rotational flow and remain almost entirely axisymmetric throughout their runtimes .",
    "the simulations of ra included a random density perturbation of 3% in their initial upstream flow as a means of breaking the initial symmetry of the flow .",
    "our simulations do not include any initial noise , but some intrinsic noise is generated at the bow shock due to the numerical algorithm .",
    "the effects of this noise can be seen in figure [ fig : machsmall ] , in which the asymmetry is visible near the downstream surface of the accretor .",
    "the addition of small density perturbations is likely to be insufficient to significantly affect the stability of the flow , and would likely have an effect similar to that of the numerical noise .",
    "the simulations of @xcite suggest that large - scale density and velocity gradients ( 3% and 20% across the upstream accretion column ) may be more likely to instigate a non - stationary flow .",
    "these simulations displayed a relatively stable bow shock and no flip - flop behavior .",
    "the presence of the breathing mode and slight asymmetries near the accretor in the small - accretor case indicate that our results follow the general trend present in 2d simulations : a smaller accretor produces a less stable flow pattern .",
    "this supports the notion that extending 3d simulations to smaller accretor radii is critical for understanding the true behavior of hla in astrophysical contexts .",
    "the continued investigation of its stability under the influence of greater perturbations ( including large scale gradients ) and smaller accretor size will allow us to reassess what conditions , if any , produce an unstable flow and possible accretion of angular momentum . in addition , introducing strong localized density perturbations analogous to those of a clumpy stellar wind may provide insight into the nature of supergiant fast x - ray transient outbursts while simultaneously addressing fundamental questions regarding stability .",
