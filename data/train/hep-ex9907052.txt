    "in particular , the inclusive decay @xmath11 has not been measured .",
    "this branching fraction serves as an independent check for the existence of additional exclusive decays of _ d _ mesons that contain a @xmath7 meson .",

    "in this letter , we report a first measurement of the inclusive @xmath7 decay branching fractions of charged and neutral _ d _ mesons and a search for the exclusive semileptonic decay @xmath16 based on an analysis of 22.3 _ pb@xmath2 _ of data collected with the beijing spectrometer ( bes ) in @xmath17 annihilations at @xmath18 gev .",

    "bes is a conventional solenoidal detector operated at the beijing electron positron collider ( bepc)@xcite . a four - layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) surrounding the beam pipe is used for triggering purposes . a forty - layer main drift chamber ( mdc ) located just outside the cdc provides measurements of charged tracks and ionization energy loss ( ) with a solid angle coverage of @xmath19 of @xmath20 for charged tracks .",

    "an array of 48 scintillation counters surrounds the mdc and measures the time of flight ( tof ) of charged tracks with a resolution of about 350 ps for bhabha electrons and 450 ps for hadrons . surrounding",
    "the tof is a 12-radiation - length , lead - gas barrel shower counter ( bsc ) operated in limited streamer mode , which measures the energy of electrons and photons over @xmath19 of 4@xmath25 , with an energy resolution of @xmath26(@xmath27 in gev ) , and spatial resolution of @xmath28 mrad and @xmath29 cm for electrons . outside",
    "the bsc is a solenoidal magnet providing a 0.4 t magnetic field for the central tracking region of the detector .",
    "three double - layers of muon counters instrument the magnet flux return , and serve to identify muons with transverse momenta greater than 500 mev/@xmath23 .",
    "they cover @xmath30 of 4@xmath25 with a longitudinal ( transverse ) spatial resolution of 5 cm ( 3 cm ) .",

    "the prompt or transition pion is not identified .",
    "reconstructing a specific @xmath31 meson does not necessarily determine whether the recoiling @xmath39 meson is charged or neutral . in order to measure @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    "specifically , the numbers of neutral and charged @xmath39 mesons recoiling against a reconstructed @xmath31 meson , which tags the @xmath42 events , and the types of the @xmath31 meson from which the @xmath7 mesons come , must be determined .",
    "a recoil charge method for identifying the type of the recoiling @xmath31 meson has been devised for this measurement . at @xmath434.03 gev , charged pions arising from  decay are very slow , and are mostly undetected in the bes detector . only charged particles from decays of @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "are measured , and their total charge is correlated with the type of the mother @xmath31 meson .",

    "@xmath31 decays , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are determined to be 0.74@xmath530.02 and 0.25@xmath530.02 , respectively , and are the same for both charged and neutral recoiling",
    "these values are confirmed with data using a kinematically selected data sample of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where one _ d _ meson has been reconstructed .",

    "the slightly higher efficiency for this sample is due to the absence of charged transition pions .",
    "when both a _ d _ meson and a recoil @xmath7 are fully reconstructed , the efficiency of the recoil charge method is improved over that of the inclusive _ d _ events because there are fewer remaining tracks and they tend to cluster along the @xmath7 direction and are therefore well within the detector acceptance .",
    "a monte carlo study of various _ d _ decay modes into final states containing a @xmath7 has been performed , and the variations among their efficiencies are included in the systematic errors . for events with a reconstructed @xmath7 ,",
