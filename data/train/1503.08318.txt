    "although the formation mechanism of spiral structures excite the fantasy of scientists for a long time , a general explanation is not available partly due to the diversity of the underlying physical phenomena .",
    "while the details differ in various realizations of spiral growth , diffusion and phase separation often play a role in the respective models .",
    "for example , the aggregation of starving cells is controlled by propagating spiral waves of a chemo - attractant , often yielding multiarmed spiral patterns in the case of slime mold @xcite . in _ binary _",
    "eutectics , spiraling has been associated with a specific anisotropy of the free energy of the solid - solid interface @xcite , the presence of screw dislocations @xcite , or recently to fingering driven by osmotic flow @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the newly discovered spiraling _ ternary _ eutectic dendrites emerge from the interplay of two - phase solidification with the mullins - sekerka - type diffusional instability caused by a third component , whose solubility differs in the solid and liquid phases @xcite . the complex microstructures observed in some of the ternary alloys",
    "@xcite are also suspected to emerge due to the presence of two - phase dendrites @xcite .",

    "studies of biological excitable media , relying on the fn model , have clarified essential features of spiral growth @xcite : the mechanism by which the multi - arm spirals do form is the attraction of single spirals rotating in the same direction , whereas the number of spiral arms is associated with the ratio of the single spiral period to the refractoriness of the medium .",
    "apparently , in such systems the multi - arm spiral structures are unstable unless the excitability is sufficiently low .",
    "some other models provide single spiral structures exclusively @xcite .",
    "remarkably , even pure confined systems were found to display chiral symmetry breaking , and thus spiral growth in phase - field simulations @xcite .",
    "a recent work based on cahn - hilliard type reaction - diffusion model of helical liesegang systems indicate that single and multiple helixes may occur and the fluctuations choose from the possible configurations @xcite .",
    "a similar scenario has been outlined in a recent work of us in which ternary eutectic dendrites may realize a variety of eutectic patterns including a target pattern and multiple spiraling motifs of which thermal fluctuations of the system choose @xcite . in our work , we have been looking for a suitable physical model and shown that a simple ternary extension of the standard binary phase - field theory is able to describe the formation of eutectic dendrites , offering thus the first model that is able to capture details of such exotic growth patterns .",
    "we note , furthermore , that this is another remarkable success of the phase - field theory : without any specific adjustments to make spiraling eutectic dendrites , a minimal and fairly standard version of the phase - field theory of ternary solidification proved capable of recovering these rather complex solidification morphologies .",
    "we have shown that ( a ) in many respects eutectic dendrites behave like the single - phase dendrites ( e.g. , shape , tip radius vs. interface free energy , etc . ) ; ( b ) there is a multiplicity of eutectic patterns , which lead to steady - state dendritic growth under nominally the same conditions ; these are the target pattern , and single- to multi - arm spiraling structures ; ( c ) it is the fluctuations that choose from these competing growth modes ; ( d ) the number of spiral arms tends to increase with increasing dendrite tip radius , however , with some stochastic scattering . in a more recent analytic study , akamatsu and coworkers @xcite have addressed dendrite formation in ternary eutectic systems .",

    "( the latter is the jackson - hunt relationship of eutectic solidification @xcite , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the eutectic wavelength , the tip radius of the dendrite , and the tip velocity , respectively ) , the dendrite selection mechanism differs from the one seen in binary systems suggesting that in the case of ternary spiraling dendrites anisotropy is not neccessary for steady - state dendritic growth .",
    "remarkably , assumption ( ii ) seems to be in contradiction with the analytic predictions by liu _",
    "@xcite for higher concentrations @xmath10 of the third component , obtained assuming a rotational paraboloid shape for the two - phase dendrite .",

    "it is yet desirable to clarify these contradictory issues .    herein , we focus our attention to the ternary eutectic dendrites and extend our previous phase - field study @xcite in the following directions : ( a ) a detailed investigation of the stochastic eutectic pattern selection mechanism ; ( b ) testing of scaling laws ( i ) and ( ii ) ; and ( c ) interaction of neighboring eutectic dendrites .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows : in section ii , we give a brief description of our model and justify the model parameters used during the simulations . in section iii , we review details of the performed numerical simulations , whereas in section iv we present our results for the formation of two - phase dendrites , the scaling laws ( i ) and ( ii ) , the pattern selection mechanism , the role played by the anisotropies , and the dendrite - dendrite interaction .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section v and offer a few concluding remarks .",
    "we adopt here a simple ternary phase - field model used in our previous study @xcite . it can be obtained as a straightforward generalization @xcite of the phase - field model of binary solidification@xcite , whose variants and extensions have been used successfully for describing homogeneous @xcite and heterogeneous @xcite nucleation , and crystal growth including dendritic @xcite and eutectic freezing @xcite , and even polycrystalline solidification treating nucleation and growth on equal footing @xcite .",
    "such models turned out to be quantitative on the nanoscale for nucleation @xcite , whereas qualitative results were obtained for broader interfaces @xcite .",

    "as in our previous study @xcite , the majority of our simulations has been started by including a slab of solid of length @xmath59 into the simulation box ( @xmath60 is the length of the simulation box in direction @xmath50 ) with a small hump at the center , whereas the initial composition of the solid has been set to @xmath61 and @xmath62 [ see fig .

    "the random transversal distribution represents here the effect of all the thermal fluctuations from the nucleation of the eutectic grain to the starting of the simulation .",
