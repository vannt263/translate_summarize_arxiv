    "the faint end of the luminosity function of galaxies is generally modeled by a power law which is significantly shallower than that prescribed by the @xmath13cdm scenario for the low end of the mass function of dark matter halos .",
    "when this mismatch between observations and theory is found in the vicinity of massive galaxies such as the milky way ( mw ) , it is referred to as the `` missing satellite problem '' @xcite ; when encountered in regions of very low galaxy density , it is referred to as the `` void phenomenon '' @xcite . here , we shall refer to the issue generically as the `` dwarf galaxy problem '' : the observed underabundance of low - mass galaxies relative to theoretical expectations . the conflict between observations and theory",
    "is also encountered in the behavior of the hi mass function @xcite , the rotational velocity width function @xcite , and the baryonic mass function of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the numerous ultra - faint dwarf galaxies found in the vicinity of the mw and m31 discovered over the last decade in wide - field optical surveys have alleviated somewhat  but by no means resolved  the mismatch between theory and observations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ultra - faint dwarf satellites of the mw are located at small galactocentric distances , well inside the virial radius of the mw , and thus their structural and evolutionary properties have been drastically affected by tidal and hydrodynamical processes @xcite , making it difficult to assess their primitive characteristics .",
    "the possibility that hi observations might help resolve the dwarf galaxy problem was proposed in two influential papers more than a decade ago @xcite , in which the hi high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) were invoked as baryonic but starless counterparts to low - mass dark matter halos in the local group . in particular , the more compact of those hvcs ( sizes @xmath14 ) were proposed as representative of the relatively primordial , yet undisturbed population of lg low - mass halos .",
    "this interpretation was challenged by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter smw02 ) , on the grounds that , if placed at typical lg distances ( @xmath2 mpc ) : ( i ) the sizes of even the more compact hvcs ( chvcs ) known at the time were too large ( sizes @xmath15 10 kpc ) to match the mass  concentration relation of @xmath13cdm halos ; and ( ii ) the chvcs would be too massive ( @xmath16 @xmath10 ) to explain the lack of detection of similar populations in nearby groups of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the existence of gas - bearing but starless ( or nearly so ) minihalos was recently revived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g+10 ) who identified a category of even more compact hvcs ( sizes @xmath17 , thus the ultra  compact hvcs : uchvcs ) in the alfalfa extragalactic hi survey @xcite .",
    "the thermal models of smw02 are given for a broad range of intergalactic medium ( igm ) pressures . while we do nt know the specific environmental conditions at the location of any single cloud , plausible models can be fit to the uchvc data .",
    "placed to distances of a few mpc , their hi masses would be smaller than detection limits of extant surveys of nearby groups .",
    "the one critical item preventing the validation of the idea that the uchvcs can be counterparts of extragalactic minihalos is that their distances are not known .",
    "there are two main routes to advancing such validation ; one would be the detection of stellar populations associated with the uchvcs ; the other would be the detection of a population of objects with comparable hi properties in a nearby group of galaxies , clearly associated by virtue of similarity in the distribution of radial velocities . here",
    "we report on a finding that allows for progress along the former route .",
    "the object involved is a dwarf galaxy located in the immediate vicinity of the lg .",
    "making use of the seven - horn arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) , the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey alfalfa @xcite is a blind survey in the hi 21 cm line covering 7000 deg@xmath18   of high galactic latitude sky in two regions : a `` spring '' northern galactic circumpolar region between @xmath19 and @xmath20 in r.a . and a `` fall '' southern galactic region between @xmath21 and @xmath22 in r.a .",

    "data processing is carried out sequentially on stripes @xmath29 wide in declination .",
    "signal identification is performed by applying a matched filtering algorithm in the fourier domain @xcite .",
    "the process of catalog construction also includes the inspection of optical databases and the assignment of the most probable optical counterpart to each hi signal .    during the course of construction of the alfalfa catalog along the spring stripe centered at dec.= + 17@xmath30 ,",
    "an hi source with heliocentric velocity of 264 km  s@xmath1   was detected at @xmath31  ( epoch 2000.0 ) .",
    "the source was designated as an uchvc of the type reported by g+10 .",
    "the hi emission appeared to be very weakly , if at all , resolved by the 4   alfa beam .",
    "although no cataloged optical galaxy is recorded near the hi position , a very faint blue object appears in both the sdss and dss2 blue images , @xmath0 20   ne of the alfalfa centroid , but within the positional error box .",
    "the sdss image exhibits an irregular , lumpy light distribution that could be described as being marginally resolved into stars .",
    "in fact , what we now identify as a single galaxy is seen as a combination of several photometric objects in the sdss database , some of which are classified as stars and some as galaxies .",
    "it is identified as a compact group of galaxies ( sdsscgb11269 ) by @xcite who used an automated search algorithm to identify such objects in the sdss dr6 catalog .",
    "as those authors note , spurious identification of compact groups can be due to errors in the photometric catalog .",
    "in fact , this group candidate is included in their less reliable `` catalog b '' .",
    "aided by the good position match with that of the hi source , however , the visual inspection of both the sdss and the dss2 blue images suggested an alternative interpretation : that of a very faint , nearby , star forming dwarf galaxy . follow - up optical observations reported by @xcite : ( i ) confirmed that the hi source has a stellar counterpart , ( ii ) provided an accurate optical flux , partly resolved into individual stars , ( iii ) detected h@xmath32 emission indicative of current star formation activity and ( iv ) produced an independent estimate of the galaxy s distance .",

    ", @xcite clearly detected the stellar population associated with leo p , showed that it extends to a radius of @xmath34 pc and has a stellar mass of @xmath35 @xmath10 .",
    "they also obtained constraints to the distance @xmath33 of leo p. after extraction of a sample of @xmath36 resolved stars , a color - magnitude diagram allowed an identification of the red giant stellar branch ( rgb ) , to which isochrones could be fitted .",
    "however , the sparseness of the stellar population , coupled with the limited depth of their photometric data , makes the determination of the location of the branch tip ( trgb ) difficult .",
    "recently , deeper optical broad band images of the leo p field have been obtained with the lbt by k. mcquinn et al .",
    "( private communication ) .",
    "these data allow a clear identification of the rgb but , again , due to the sparseness of the resolved stellar population , the location of the trgb can not yet be sharply defined . both groups do however agree that the analysis of their respective data sets indicate that the distance to leo p lies somewhere between 1.5 and 2.0 mpc .",
    "these estimates are complemented by , and in agreement with that of @xmath8 obtained using the baryonic tully - fisher relation , presented in section 3.3 .",

    "; however , close inspection of the alfalfa map suggests that the arecibo beam starts to resolve a weak extension of the source to the se .",
    "it is unlikely to be due to telescope beam sidelobes .",
    "thus , a rough estimate of the half - mass hi radius between 0.8 and 1.5 can be made .",

    "however , only half of the alfalfa flux is recovered in the vla image ( including flux rescaling : see jorsater & van  moorsel 1995 ) at 30   resolution , indicating that much of the hi detected by alfalfa is in a diffuse component more extended than that scale .",

    "an even smaller fraction of the baryon mass could be present within the inner region of the wim , in the form of a warm neutral gas phase ( wnm ) or even in the form of a cold neutral phase ( cnm ) , eventually capable of converting some of its gas into stars . according to those models ,",

    "detection of such weak hi emitters would have been impossible by past or current wide field surveys beyond a few mpc from us .",
