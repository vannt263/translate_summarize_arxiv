    "the casimir effect is an imprint of the quantum vacuum energy of a quantum field theory @xcite . since the theoretical prediction by casimir in 1948 @xcite , many developments in the research area of the casimir energy have been done , with the applications of the casimir energy varying from the macro - scale physics @xcite to the micro - scale @xcite , with the macro - scale physics having to do with cosmological predictions and the micro - scale application having to do with nano - scale and micro - scale mechanical devises .",
    "it is a well established fact that the casimir energy is affected by the geometry and topology of spacetime and also drastically affected by the shape and the geometry of the apparatus . since the casimir energy is an important ingredient of a consistent quantum field theory , the calculations of the casimir energy and force have been performed for scalar fields @xcite , fermion fields @xcite for various spacetime topologies .",
    "moreover , the topological structure of spacetime can be revealed or be severely constrained by sophisticated casimir force experiments @xcite .    particularly ,",
    "since the casimir energy experiments are much less expensive in comparison to particle collider experiments , they can be used as a mean to reveal the non - trivial low energy spacetime structure , with the non - triviality being caused by extra dimensions for example . in reference to extra dimensions , a lot of questions have to be answered , for instance , what is the compactification mechanism , how extra dimensions are stabilized , what is the compactification scale , how many extra dimensions exist , what is their topology and geometry etc . since",
    "string theory predictions involve many extra dimensional compactifications for matter fields ( that is fermions fields ) , with some of these compactifications involving non - trivial fluxes or defects , it is interesting to find the impact of such compactification mechanisms in the low energy physical phenomena .",
    "this actually serves as a motivation to study theoretically the casimir energy of fermion fields in the presence of such extra - dimensional non - trivial configurations , and calculate the casimir force on a macroscopic system , such as two or more parallel plates .",
    "one refined technique for calculating the casimir force is that of the casimir piston , which has received considerable attention in the last years . for an important stream of papers on casimir pistons",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this is owing to the attractive quantitative features that the piston setup has .",
    "the casimir piston is materialized by three parallel plates , with a quantum field considered to exist between these plates .",
    "thus , the calculation of casimir force on a piston in the presence of compact extra dimensions is an important task in order to see the effect of the extra dimensions in such configurations . the piston geometry and in general , multiple parallel plates periodic geometry is frequently realized in nano and micro - devices . due to the attractive attributes that the piston setup offers",
    ", we shall study the fermionic field casimir force for the piston setup , in the presence of extra dimensions .",
    "particularly , we shall calculate the casimir force for massless fermionic fields coupled to a defect in the extra dimensional space .",
    "this is a low energy analogue of the superstring inspired flux compactifications .",
    "moreover , the fermions are assumed to satisfy bag boundary conditions on the piston plates , which is the only form of boundary conditions appropriate for fermions , since the dirac equation can not be solved in corners ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in order to have a clear picture of the behavior of the casimir force",
    ", we shall also calculate the casimir force for various other extra dimensional spaces and compare the results to the defect - fermion case .",
    "as we will demonstrate , in certain limiting cases , the casimir force corresponding to the defect - fermion and sphere cases behaves completely differently , in reference to the toroidal extra dimensional spaces case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 1 , we present the piston setup that will be used in the forthcoming sections and provide some general expressions of the casimir energy and force , in the piston setup . in section 2 we calculate the casimir force for the defect - fermion system with a torus extra dimensional space and the defect existing in the extra dimensions .",
    "the calculation is performed in various limiting cases . the same analysis is done in section 3 , in the case the extra dimensional space is a sphere , torus and a circle , with various boundary conditions for the fermions in the extra space .",
    "a discussion along with the conclusions follow in section 4 .",
    "direction ]    assume that the total spacetime time has the form @xmath0 , with @xmath1 denoting the four dimensional minkowski spacetime and @xmath2 the extra dimensional space .",
    "the piston setup is like the one in fig .",
    "( [ olaskata3dfgdfg ] ) , where @xmath3 denotes one of the three spatial dimensions of the four dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "the piston has two chambers with lengths @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the fermion field is assumed to be confined in each chamber , and also that it satisfies bag boundary conditions on the plates at @xmath6 , @xmath7 and at @xmath8 .",
    "let us briefly recall the essentials of bag boundary conditions . consider a dirac fermion field in 3 space dimensions with three parallel plates in one of the three spatial dimensions , at @xmath6 , @xmath7 and at @xmath8 .",
    "we shall also assume that fermions are not allowed to exist outside the parallel plate system .",
    "this is the physical implication of the mit bag boundary conditions which are expressed by the equation , @xmath9 or in lorentz covariant form , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the vector normal to the surface of the plates directed to the interior of the slab configuration .",
    "the above two equations indicate that there is no fermion current flowing outwards from the parallel plates .",
    "the eigenvalues of the massless dirac equation obeying bag boundary conditions between two plates at @xmath6 and @xmath8 are @xcite , @xmath13 where ",
    "@xmath14  refer to the transverse components of the momentum .",
    "we shall provide a general expression of the casimir energy using the zeta - regularization method @xcite .",
    "in addition , we adopt the dimensional regularization technique , by assuming @xmath15 euclidean spatial dimensions .",

    "the summation over the @xmath17 is done over the quantum numbers characterizing the extra dimensions .",
    "note that in the end we must substitute @xmath18 and @xmath19 . upon integrating over the continuous dimensions using the formula , @xmath20 the casimir energy ( [ vlad ] ) reads , @xmath21}^{-(s-\\frac{d-1}{2})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the above relation can be written in terms of the inhomogeneous epstein zeta function @xcite , @xmath22^{-s}.\\ ] ] as follows , @xmath23 using the formula , @xmath24 and also , @xmath25 the casimir energy can be cast as : @xmath26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice the first term on the right hand side .",
    "it is singular , since it contains gamma function which is singular for @xmath19 .",
    "the contribution from the chamber @xmath4 , can be found from the above by simply making the replacement : @xmath27 consequently , the total casimir energy of the piston , is the sum of the two contributions , @xmath28 therefore , the casimir force is equal to : @xmath29 observe that the final expression of the casimir force is regular , since the singular terms canceled each other when the contributions from the two chambers were added .",
    "this is the greatest attribute of the casimir piston geometry . in the following sections we shall study analytically the various limiting cases of the casimir force for the defect - fermion system , and compare it to the casimir force corresponding to other extra dimensional compact spaces .",
    "before we close this section , we shall perform a small argument approximation for the casimir force and provide a general formula for the force .",
    "we shall use this general formula quite frequently in the sections that follow . in order to find the small argument expansion of the casimir force , we write the casimir energy in the following form : @xmath30}^{-(s-\\frac{d-1}{2})}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we shall use the small - q expansion , which can be found in the book of elizalde @xcite ( page 83 equation 4.34 ) , @xmath31}^{-s}=\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^m\\gamma ( m+s)}{\\gamma ( s)m!}q^m\\zeta_h(2s+2m , c)\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the hurwitz zeta function , @xmath33 therefore , the casimir energy for the @xmath5-chamber is equal to : @xmath34 differentiating with respect to  a  and adding the contributions of the two chambers , we get for @xmath19 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 for @xmath37 the hurwitz zeta function becomes singular , but the expression ( [ forcesmallq ] ) is regular because the singularities from the two chambers cancel .",
    "this is exactly what was expected , owing to the piston geometry . utilizing equation ( [ forcesmallq ] )",
    ", we shall find in the following sections the small argument expansion for various extra dimensional spaces .",
    "the small argument expansion for our case can be satisfied when the following constraints hold true : @xmath38 for the purposes of this article and according to the above constraints , suffices to take @xmath39 m and @xmath40 , with the latter choice being consistent with the newton s law experiments .",
    "the defect - fermion system that we shall use has been studied in @xcite .",
    "it worths outlining the general features of this system , in order to render the article self - contained . following @xcite ,",
    "the defect in the extra dimensional two torus , is a monopole , and is constructed in the following way . consider a sphere @xmath41 described by the polar coordinates @xmath42 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "two patches are needed on this manifold , the upper and the lower hemisphere with intersection at the equator @xmath45 , @xmath46 the matter field phases on the two coordinate patches , must be related as : @xmath47 the number @xmath48 is an integer , since the phases must be single valued on the equator , and this number is actually the winding number of the large gauge transformation .",
    "the gauge potentials are related by the following gauge transformation : @xmath49 with : @xmath50 the torus @xmath51 , can be constructed from @xmath41 by restricting the coordinate @xmath52 to the range @xmath53 and then equating @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "we assume that the circumferences of the two circles that constitute the torus are equal , and @xmath56 .",
    "the relations between the potentials and matter fields on the patches @xmath57 , are given by : @xmath58 the following boundary conditions are imposed : @xmath59 when expressed as coordinate conditions of the functions on the `` @xmath60 '' patch , these are written as follows , @xmath61 therefore , an appropriate choice of the potential , which satisfies the above conditions and also constitutes a monopole on the space @xmath51 , with winding number @xmath48 , is : @xmath62 the field strength reads , @xmath63 the dirac fermion lagrangian , coupled to the monopole field is equal to : @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the total spacetime manifold @xmath66 is described by the coordinates @xmath67 and the metric is assumed to have the signature @xmath68 .",
    "obviously the total manifold is flat .",
    "the dirac gamma matrices are decomposed as a tensor product : @xmath69 with @xmath70 are the four dimensional matrices , and @xmath71 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the gauge background is of the form : @xmath72 as already mentioned , the electromagnetic field strength has only one non - zero component , namely : @xmath73 which is of the form ( [ noname ] ) .    in order to calculate the casimir energy , we must find the eigenmodes of the dirac operator in this torus - monopole background .",
    "these can be obtained by solving the following equation , @xmath74 with @xmath75 , the eigenvalues of the dirac operator and @xmath76 .",
    "this task is simplified if we find the eigenvalues of the following operator : @xmath77 with @xmath78 , being equal to : @xmath79}\\ ] ] solving the above , the square of the eigenvalues of the dirac operator in such a background are obtained @xcite : @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "these are the kaluza - klein modes of the dirac operator that enter the casimir energy calculation . substituting these in relation ( [ pex1 ] )",
    ", the casimir energy for the chamber with length @xmath5 reads , @xmath82}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] analogously , we can obtain the contribution for the @xmath4 chamber , but we omit it for brevity .",
    "it is much more convenient to work in limiting cases of the theory . in the approximation where the argument of the bessel function that appear in the fourth and fifth line of relation ( [ pex1 ] ) is large ( we shall refer to this as `` large argument approximation '' in the following )",

    ", we have to give some realistic values to these , always compatible to the approximation ( [ besselapprox ] ) .",
    "let us recall some facts from conventional casimir energy experiments for parallel plates geometry . in the plate geometry ,",
    "what is measured is the force per surface , which is of the form @xcite : @xmath90 with @xmath5 the distance between the two plates and @xmath91 the speed of light .",
    "moreover , it is assumed that @xmath92 . for a realistic experiment , @xmath5 is of the order of @xmath93 , and the surface @xmath94 . in such a case ,",
    "the casimir force is of the order of @xmath95 n. for the case at hand we shall assume that @xmath96 m , and search when the large argument approximation of the bessel function is valid .",
    "as it can be easily checked , the approximation is valid when the compactification radius of the extra dimensional space is @xmath97 nm . these values are certainly compatible to the constraints posed by newton law experiments on the compactification radius , in which experiments the compactification radius has to be @xmath98 mm @xcite .",
    "supposing that @xmath99 and also that @xmath5 always takes values compatible to the approximation ( [ besselapprox ] ) , we plot in fig .",
    "( [ olaskata1 ] ) , the dependence of the casimir force on the central plate , as a function of @xmath5 , for the cases that the compactification radius is @xmath100 nm and @xmath101 nm .",
    "notice that a slight change of the compactification radius @xmath102 has a severe impact on the scale of the casimir force , rendering it very small or large enough to be measured .",
    "in addition , the dependence of the casimir force as a function of @xmath5 is the expected one from piston geometries .    the casimir force on the central plate of a piston , as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath100 nm and @xmath101 nm . ]    the casimir force on the central plate of a piston , as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath100 nm and @xmath101 nm . ]    notice that the force is attractive near the the @xmath8 plate and repulsive near the @xmath6 plate .",
    "in the small argument expansion limit , the behavior of the casimir force is similar to the large argument approximation , that is , repulsive near the @xmath6 plate and attractive near the @xmath8 plate .",
    "this behavior of the casimir force occurs only for the defect - fermion system and also for the sphere case , as we shall demonstrate in the following sections . for small values of the argument , using relation ( [ forcesmallq ] ) and substituting ( [ encaseorbi ] ) the casimir force for the defect - fermion system can be cast as , @xmath103 the expression ( [ forcesmallqmon ] ) contain terms that converge very fast .

    "in this paper we calculated the casimir force for fermionic quantum fields confined in a piston that consists of three parallel plates .",
    "we assumed that the field satisfies bag boundary conditions on the plates , and also that the field is massless .",
    "in addition , we also assumed that the spacetime has compact extra dimensions and we studied how these affect the fermionic casimir force on the central plate .",
    "particularly , we examined four different extra spaces , namely , a sphere , a torus , a circle and a torus with the existence of a non - trivial defect in the extra space coupled to the fermion .",
    "the casimir force was calculated for these extra spaces in two limiting cases , that is , in the large argument limit and in the small argument limit , with the argument being dependent on the fraction @xmath104 .",
    "quantitatively , if the distances of the plate are of the order of @xmath105 m , the large argument limit is achieved when the compactification radius of the extra space is of the order @xmath106 nm , while the small argument limit is achieved when the compactification radius is lower than the newton law experiments limit @xmath107 m . as we explicitly demonstrated , the case in which the extra space contains a defect coupled to the fermion and also when the extra space is a sphere , in the small argument limit , the casimir force has opposite sign compared to the casimir force of the toroidal topologies .",
    "apart from this apparent difference between the aforementioned spaces , the casimir force in the large argument limit behaves in the same way for all the spacetimes",
    ". a general feature of the casimir force for all cases , is that a small change in the compactification radius amounts in huge changes in the casimir force .",
    "we assumed that the compactification radius is smaller than @xmath108 mm .",
    "this constraint is imposed by newton law experiments , in which deviations from the standard newton law due to extra dimensions are measured .    in the present study",
    ", we tried to have a hint on how the fermionic casimir energy behaves , for a piston geometry with three parallel plates .",
    "we used realistic length scales in our formulas but the results are by far incomplete .",
    "this is owing to the fact that a realistic calculation should take into account the finite temperature corrections , roughness corrections and also other issues that could critically change the result @xcite .",
    "however , the outcomes of this paper show us some very interesting features of the casimir force in the presence of extra dimensions .",
    "specifically , the measurement of the casimir force can show us which extra space structure causes this force .",
    "this is in contrast to newton law experiments , in which a phenomenon called shadowing can make the identification of the extra space , almost impossible @xcite .",
    "thus , in conjunction with the fact that the casimir effect experiments are less expensive than particle accelerators experiments , these can serve as a tool for revealing the micro - structure of spacetime and also for unveiling the quantum structure ( if any ) of spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the casimir effect is important in the construction and operation of nano - scale and micro - scale devices .",
    "therefore , a better understanding of the casimir force dependence on shape , material and geometry is of crucial importance @xcite .",
    "the casimir force is one of the principal causes of malfunctions in these devices because of the stiction of nearby elements .",
    "the van der waals forces have an important property , the fact that these are non - additive , which gives a many body interpretation of the forces .",
    "hence , a better theoretical understanding of the casimir - van der waals forces is of particular importance .",
    "in addition , owing to the fact that the casimir forces increase strongly when the distance between elements of the nano - devices decrease , these forces play a crucial role in devices that contain nano - scale or ( micro - scale ) moving elements , the so called nano - scale ( micro - scale ) actuators .",
    "hence , a minimum separation between the elements must be determined in order to avoid stiction .",
    "in addition , in periodically structured parallel surfaces , the casimir force between the surfaces can be controlled .",
    "notice that , the piston geometry is analogous to these periodical parallel surfaces construction , hence the present study might offer valuable information for these devices .",
