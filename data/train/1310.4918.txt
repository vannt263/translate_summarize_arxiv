    "over the past decade , a considerable number of theoretical and experimental studies on ultracold atomic gases in an optical lattice have been conducted@xcite .",
    "the pioneering experimental research is the observation of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition by loading a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) into an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "femiomic atoms in an optical lattice are also important in condensed matter physics since they directly correspond to interacting electrons in solids .",
    "fermions in an optical lattice could be employed for studies of high-@xmath6 superconductivity , quantum magnetism , and so on .",
    "as groundbreaking experiments , fermionic mott insulators are also realized @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of the ultracold atoms in an optical lattice over solid state systems is high controllability of hubbard parameters such as the on - site interaction and the tunneling rate between neighboring sites .",
    "another advantage is the fact that defects of optical lattices can be controlled , i.e. , even disorder and impurity are treated as controllable parameters .",
    "they are thought to play a key role in high-@xmath7 superconductivity , anderson localization , and some novel quantum phases such as bose glass etc . controlled disorder systems in ultracold gases",
    "are so far provided by an optical speckle pattern @xcite , an incommensurate optical lattice potential superimposed on the main lattice @xcite , or by loading two atomic species into an optical lattice @xcite . in particular , ultracold gas mixtures in optical lattices are well described by the binary - alloy anderson - hubbard model @xcite , where local disorders are given by random on - site energies originating from interspecies interactions between localized impurities and mobile atomic species .",
    "we focus on a mixture of @xmath0yb and @xmath1li atoms in an optical lattice system with an interest in disorder and impurity problems .",
    "the most distinctive feature of this mixture is the very large mass ratio of 29 . because of this large mass ratio",
    ", the tunneling rate of @xmath0yb atoms can be more than three orders of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath8li atoms in a deep optical lattice with a wavelength of 1064 nm , for example .",
    "therefore , heavy atoms of @xmath0yb play a role of localized impurities and light atoms of @xmath1li behave as itinerant electrons . with regard to the interspecies interaction ,",
    "the absolute values of @xmath9-wave scattering length have already been measured @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to resonantly control interspecies interactions , but it is pointed out by a theoretical calculation that precise control of the @xmath9-wave scattering length between @xmath0yb and @xmath1li is experimentally challenging due to the extremely narrow width of feshbach resonances @xcite . on the other hand , if the metastable @xmath4p@xmath5 state of @xmath0yb atoms , whose energy diagram is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : energydiagram ] , are introduced as localized impurities instead of the ground @xmath2s@xmath3 state atoms , there is a possibility of controlling the interaction between the impurity and the itinerant @xmath1li atoms in the ground @xmath10s@xmath11 state via anisotropy - induced feshbach resonances @xcite , which allows us to suddenly switch from a weak to a strong interaction . in particular , the ultra - narrow optical transition @xmath2s@xmath3-@xmath4p@xmath5 in the presence of the feshbach resonances enables the exploration of impurity problems such as anderson s orthogonality catastrophe , in which impurities are localized by an optical lattice potential immersed in a sea of itinerant fermions @xcite . note that the study of the dynamics is possible in this system , differently from a solid - state system with the fast time scale , and our system could be a candidate to study the anderson s orthogonality catastrophe not only in frequency domain but also in time domain .",
    "in addition , a molecule produced from this mixture has not only an electric dipole moment but also electronic spin degrees of freedom in the ground state .",
    "spin - doublet molecules in an optical lattice enables us to implement quantum simulation of lattice - spin models @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2s@xmath3-@xmath2p@xmath12 transition ( @xmath13 = 399 nm ) is used for zeeman slowing , for absorption imaging , and for removing the @xmath2s@xmath3 state atoms remaining in a trap ( for blast ) .",

    "we measure the influence of @xmath1li atoms on the coherence property of @xmath0yb and on the excitation spectra of @xmath0yb using the ultra - narrow optical transition @xmath2s@xmath3-@xmath4p@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , we measure polarizabilities of the @xmath4p@xmath5 state @xmath0yb in a laser field with a wavelength of 1070 nm in order to reveal whether they can be trapped in a 1 @xmath15 m optical trap .",

    "we transfer both atoms from the mot into a crossed optical far - off - resonance trap ( fort ) and perform sympathetic cooling of @xmath1li with evaporatively cooled @xmath0yb . the horizontal fort beam ( @xmath13 = 1070 nm ) is in an ellipsoidal shape , with the beam waists of 106 @xmath15 m along the horizontal direction and 22 @xmath15 m along the vertical direction , in order to obtain a large trap volume and suppress the gravitational sag at the final stage of evaporative cooling .",
    "another fort beam ( @xmath13 = 1083 nm ) , propagating along the almost vertical direction , has a round shape with a beam waist of 104 @xmath15 m .",

    "while in our target experiments of impurity problems @xmath0yb atoms should play a role of localized impurities , its first step of the successful formation of the optical lattice is easily confirmed by measuring the matter - wave interference patterns of @xmath0yb bec at a relatively shallow optical lattice where the phase coherence exists at the superfluid state of @xmath0yb atoms .",

    "the widths start to increase at around 16 @xmath33 . if the critical value of the lattice depth for the transition is defined as the intersection of the two linear functions , it is @xmath49 @xmath33 for the @xmath0yb , which almost agrees with the values estimated from the mean - field approximation .    the above measurements on the @xmath0yb matter - wave interference show that we could successfully load the @xmath0yb atoms into the optical lattice",

    "furthermore , we also try to observe the influence of the @xmath1li for the @xmath0yb atom signals . in order to clearly discuss the influence of @xmath1li atoms , for the data without @xmath1li atoms we remove @xmath1li atoms in the fort by irradiating a laser pulse resonant to the @xmath10s@xmath11-@xmath10p@xmath16 ( d@xmath5 ) transition ( li blast laser , @xmath13 = 671 nm ) for 1 ms , followed by 10 ms holding time , before ramping up the lattice potential as shown in fig .",

    "the influence of @xmath1li on the phase coherence of @xmath0yb can be recognized as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : visibility ] ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) , but it is very small .",
    "this is in good contrast with the case of @xmath64rb-@xmath65k mixture @xcite where even very small fraction of fermionic atoms dramatically changes the coherence property of the bosonic cloud .",
    "we think several reasons for small influence .",
    "the first reason is the imperfect spatial overlap of @xmath0yb and @xmath1li . as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ subsec : preparation ] , the center of @xmath0yb bec is 7.8 @xmath15 m lower than that of @xmath1li at the final phase of evaporation due to the gravitational sag .",
    "after loading of the atoms into the optical lattice , the @xmath0yb cloud is broadened to 5.3 @xmath15 m radius along the z - direction for the case of the adiabatic loading and the atomic limit @xmath37 .",
    "even in this situation the overlap is up to 30 % .",
    "the second is that the interspecies interaction is too weak to significantly change the coherence property of @xmath0yb .",
    "the ratio of the absolute value of the on - site @xmath0yb-@xmath1li interaction @xmath66 to that between @xmath0yb @xmath67 is @xmath68 , which supports the small influence .",
    "here we use @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "@xmath70 is the recoil energy of the bosonic atom .",
    "note that the possibility of phase separation is excluded in this experiment .",
    "a stability condition for a mixture is @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the density of @xmath1li , @xmath73 is the number of spin components of @xmath1li , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the masses of @xmath0yb and @xmath1li , @xmath76 is the reduced mass of @xmath0yb and @xmath1li , @xmath77 is the @xmath9-wave scattering length between @xmath0yb and @xmath1li , and @xmath78 is that between @xmath0yb atoms . here",
    "we consider a homogeneous system for simplicity . in our experiment , @xmath79 @xmath15 m and @xmath80 nm , which means that the stability condition is satisfied .",
    "therefore the possibility of phase separation is eliminated .",
    "we also mention the adiabaticity of the atom loading into the optical lattice . unfortunately , differently from the lattice experiments for @xmath0yb",
    "so far realized using a 532 nm laser @xcite , it is rather difficult to adiabatically load the atoms into the optical lattice with 1064 nm .",
    "in fact , we ramp down the potential to 10 @xmath33 after ramping up the lattice depth to 20 @xmath33 , interference patterns are not restored .",
    "it indicates the lack of adiabaticity during ramping up or down the lattice depth .",
    "in addition to the fact that the on - site interaction energy and the tunneling rate for a @xmath24 = 1064 nm lattice are 1/8 and 1/4 of those for a @xmath24 = 532 nm lattice , respectively , the difference of the energy offset between the neighboring sites due to an external harmonic confinement for a @xmath24 = 1064 nm lattice is larger than that for a @xmath24 = 532 nm lattice",
    ". therefore in a @xmath24 = 1064 nm lattice atoms are easily localized .",
    "this non - adiabaticity might explain the larger values of @xmath45 in the visibility measurements .",
    "we measure the polarizabilities , or ac stark shifts of the @xmath4p@xmath5 state of @xmath0yb atoms by a laser field with a wavelength of 1 @xmath15 m .",
    "this information is important because the difference between the polarizabilities of the ground and the @xmath4p@xmath5 states is directly related to spectrum inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "if the polarizability can be set to the same as that of the ground state , like a magic wavelength condition , then we can expect a narrow spectrum which is only limited by an atomic interaction . in the case of the negative polarizability , the excited atoms will escape from the trap or lattice , which limits the resolution of the spectroscopy . if the polarizability can be set to zero , then this situation is ideal for the photo - emission spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "the external magnetic field is applied along the z - axis , and the polarizations of fort lasers and the y , z - lattice beams are perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "even if the lattice potential for the @xmath2s@xmath3 state is isotropic , the potential for the @xmath4p@xmath5 is anisotropic due to @xmath97-dependence . when the depth for the @xmath2s@xmath3 state @xmath0yb is 20 @xmath33 , the potential depths for the @xmath4p@xmath5 ( @xmath100 ) state created by the x , y , and z - lattices are @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath152 @xmath33 , respectively .",

    "we evaluate the number of atoms after subtracting the background level by using the surrounding area of the image .",
    "the excitation laser is generated by the frequency doubling of a laser diode with a wavelength of 1014 nm .",
    "the laser diode is frequency locked to a high - finesse ultralow - expansion cavity with the long - term drift of 1.4 khz / hour . in order to compare the difference between the cases with and without @xmath1li atoms at the same frequency , li",

    "each data point represents the average over three data and the error bars indicate standard errors .",
    "here we discuss the excitation spectra for the pure @xmath0yb case .",
    "the spectrum shows a single broad peak .",
    "the broadening can be explained as follows .",
    "firstly , it should include resonances from the multiply occupied sites .",
    "the frequencies corresponding to the resonances from the multiply occupied sites @xmath114 , are shifted by @xmath154 relative to the resonance of the singly occupied sites . here",
    "@xmath155 is the on - site interaction between the @xmath2s@xmath3 and the @xmath4p@xmath5 states and @xmath156 is that between the @xmath2s@xmath3 states . when the potential for the @xmath2s@xmath3 state is 20 @xmath33 , the interaction strengths are @xmath157 khz and @xmath158 khz .",
    "thus the frequency differences between the neighboring peaks are 0.60 khz , and the peaks related to multiply occupied sites are located at the negative side of the peak from singly occupied sites . according to the estimation in the atomic limit @xmath37 ,",
    "the relevant peaks exist over a range of 7.3 khz corresponding to the occupation numbers of up to @xmath159 .",
    "secondly , the excitation spectra include resonances to the higher vibrational states in the optical lattice on the positive frequency side .",
    "since the lamb - dicke parameter @xcite takes a relatively large value of 0.7 , the ratio of the transition strength of the carrier , the first , and the second sidebands is @xmath160 .",
    "the frequency spacing is estimated to be 9.8 khz .",
    "therefore the peaks related to the excitations to higher vibrational states exist over a range of 20 khz .",
    "thirdly , each peak should be broadened up to 3 khz by the inhomogeneity of the potential . for these reasons",
    "the width of the excitation spectrum is about 28 khz , where this width is defined by the difference of the frequency detunings at which the signal intensity is equal to 10 % of the peak value . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectroscopy ] ( d ) we show the calculated spectrum at the atomic limit . apart from the clear structures , which are not observed in the experiments , this result is almost consistent with the obtained spectrum .    the observed spectra do not show clear difference between the cases with and without @xmath1li .",
    "possible reasons for this small difference are the small spatial overlap and the small interspecies interaction strength , which are similarly considered as the origin of the small difference of visibility .",
    "this experiment is , however , an important first step towards the exploration of time - dependent impurity problems such as anderson s orthogonality catastrophe , which could be studied if we find a feshbach resonance between the @xmath10s@xmath11 state of @xmath1li atoms and the @xmath4p@xmath5 state of @xmath0yb atoms , possibly introduced by anisotropy induced feshbach resonance , as in the @xmath2s@xmath3 ( yb ) and @xmath4p@xmath5 ( yb ) case @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we develop an optical lattice system for an ultracold atom mixture of @xmath0yb and @xmath1li . we confirm the successful formation and the loading of the optical lattice by observing the matter - wave interference patterns of @xmath0yb atoms at a relatively shallow optical lattice .",
    "we also perform a high - resolution laser spectroscopy of the @xmath0yb atom in the presence of the fermi sea of @xmath1li .",
    "although the clear differences in the interference patterns and the excitation spectra between the mixture and the pure @xmath0yb are not observed , these experiments are important first steps towards the research of impurity problems .",
    "in addition we measure the polarizabilities of the @xmath4p@xmath5 state @xmath0yb in an optical trap with a wavelength of 1070 nm and the scalar and tensor polarizabilities are determined .",
    "it is found that the polarizability of the @xmath4p@xmath5 state @xmath0yb with a wavelength around 1070 nm can take a various value by properly tuning the angle between the polarization and the external magnetic field and by selecting the magnetic substate .",
