    "a comprehensive effort towards classification of all groups generated by invertible automata on three states acting on 2 letters ( @xmath0-automata ) was started by our research group at texas a&m university in  @xcite and the current text presents further results in this direction .    the study of groups generated by finite automata is not new ( it started in the beginning of 1960 s ) . at the moment , the subject is going through a rather productive and mature phase in the sense that it is both contributing solutions to outstanding problems in various branches of mathematics ( group theory , amenability , complex dynamics , etc . ) and is developing and discovering its own fundamental concepts and theory leading to its own deep problems .",
    "a short account of the history of ideas related to the subject , as well as the most significant and interesting achievements of the theory can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we also recommend the article  @xcite and the book  @xcite to readers interested in becoming more familiar with automaton groups .",
    "groups defined by automata on 2 states acting on two letters are already classified .",
    "[ thm : class22 ] there are , up to isomorphism , @xmath1 different groups generated by @xmath2-state automata over a @xmath2-letter alphabet .",
    "namely , the trivial group , the cyclic group @xmath3 of order 2 , klein s viergruppe @xmath4 , the infinite cyclic group @xmath5 , the infinite dihedral group @xmath6 and the lamplighter group @xmath7 .",
    "we note that there are @xmath8 different ( labeled ) automata on three states acting on two letters .",
    "obvious symmetries such as permutation of states , permutation of letters , and inversion of states , together with minimization , reduces the number of automata that needs to be checked to 194 ( see  @xcite for more details ) . through additional work",
    "we were able to reduce the number of non - isomorphic groups defined by these automata .",
    "there are no more than @xmath9 pairwise non - isomorphic groups defined by automata on 3 states over a 2-letter alphabet .    for this text we chose 15 automata and we provide the basic information on each group defined by these automata .",

    "there are very few results that hold for the whole class of groups defined by automata on 3 states over a 2-letter alphabet .",
    "the reason is that this class contains many groups of rather distinct nature .",
    "the complete list contains finite groups , virtually free abelian groups , solvable groups ( such as the lamplighter group @xmath7 and baumslag - solitar groups @xmath10 ) , the free group @xmath11 of rank 3 , the free product @xmath12 , an amenable but not sub - exponentially amenable group ( the basilica group ) , and some examples about which we know very little .",

    "a proof was given in  @xcite , and here we present the original proof , which uses action of the automaton dual to the automaton 846 .",
    "a _ dual _ automaton is the automaton that is obtained after swapping the alphabet and the set of states , as well as the transition and output functions , in a given automaton .",
    "namely , if @xmath471 , then its dual automaton is @xmath472 , where @xmath473 , @xmath474 .",
    "the dual automaton represents transitions in the automata @xmath475 , @xmath476 , when they consume input letters from @xmath26 : the image of the action of @xmath29 on a word @xmath477 is the state @xmath478 of @xmath475 reached after processing the input letter @xmath41 starting from the initial state @xmath479 .",
    "in particular , the orbits of the semigroup generated by the automaton @xmath480 represent the states reachable from a given state in the automata @xmath475 , @xmath476 .",

    "if the automaton @xmath480 is invertible then its action on the set @xmath484 is in fact a group action , which coincides with the action of the tree automorphisms group generated by @xmath480 and we can apply existing techniques to study the action of @xmath480 on sets @xmath485 .",
    "consider the group @xmath470 .",
    "its generators @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 have order @xmath2 , therefore to prove that @xmath470 is isomorphic to @xmath486 we need to show that no word in @xmath487 , @xmath488 , is trivial in @xmath470 , where @xmath489 is the set of all words of length @xmath30 which do not contain squares of the letters @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 . for any @xmath490 , the set of words in @xmath491 that are not trivial in @xmath470 is nonempty .",
    "for instance , such a word is @xmath492 ( this is because @xmath130 and @xmath131 act trivially on the level 1 of the tree , while @xmath129 permutes the two vertices at level 1 ) .",

    "on the other hand , the section of @xmath519 at vertex @xmath520 coincides with @xmath519 , which shows that @xmath310 is not contracting .",
    "conjugating the generators of @xmath310 by the automorphism @xmath523 yields the recursion @xmath524 where @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",

    "see @xmath529 for further information .        for every @xmath532 , @xmath533 . therefore all points in the orbit of @xmath534 under the action of @xmath129 end in @xmath535 . for",
    "a word @xmath27 ending in @xmath535 define the _ head _ of @xmath27 to be shortest word @xmath58 such that @xmath536 .",
    "the length of the head of any infinite word ending in @xmath535 can not decrease under the action of @xmath129 .",
    "indeed , for every @xmath532 , @xmath537 on the other hand , the length of the head along the orbit can not stabilize , because in this case the orbit would be finite and we must have @xmath538 , for some @xmath539 .",
    "but this is impossible since @xmath540 and the length of the head does not decrease .",
    "thus the orbit is infinite and @xmath129 has infinite order .",
    "now by induction we get that the depth of @xmath558 is @xmath559 for @xmath560 and the depth of @xmath561 is @xmath562 for @xmath563 ( by _ depth _ of a finitary element we mean the lowest level at which all sections of the element are trivial ) .",
    "therefore , all @xmath564 are different , commute ( because for each @xmath565 and each level @xmath431 all sections of @xmath564 at level @xmath431 are equal ) , and have order @xmath2 ( they are all conjugate to @xmath396 ) . note that this proves that @xmath53 has infinite order and that @xmath566 .",
    "the subgroup @xmath339 has index at most 2 in @xmath542 because the generators of @xmath542 are of order @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , it has index exactly 2 , since there is no relation of odd length in @xmath542 .",
    "indeed , let @xmath27 be a word over @xmath498 representing the identity in @xmath542",
    ". then @xmath567 must be even ( since @xmath129 is the only generator that acts nontrivially on the first level ) .",
    "further , @xmath568 must also be even .",
    "this is because @xmath27 can be decomposed as @xmath569 where @xmath413 and @xmath414 are words over @xmath498 such that @xmath570 ( only the generator @xmath131 contributes @xmath129 to the next level in the decomposition ) .",
    "further , @xmath571 , since both @xmath129 and @xmath130 contribute @xmath131 to both coordinates on the next level .",
    "thus if @xmath572 were odd ( and we already know that @xmath567 is even ) then none of the words @xmath413 and @xmath414 would represent the identity . note that we proved by this that every word @xmath27 representing the identity in @xmath542 must have even number of occurrences of @xmath129 @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which shows not only that @xmath131 does not belong to @xmath339 , but also that the abelianization of @xmath542 is @xmath573 ( and the commutator consists precisely of the elements represented by words @xmath27 for which @xmath567 , @xmath572 , and @xmath568 are even ) .    therefore , the group @xmath574 has the structure of a semidirect product @xmath575 and the action of @xmath131 on @xmath339 is given by @xmath576 and @xmath577 .",
    "it follows that @xmath542 is solvable group of exponential growth .        for @xmath579 and @xmath580",

    "it is proved above ( see @xmath542 ) , that @xmath583 is not contracting and is isomorphic to the lamplighter group .",

    "let us prove that @xmath129 has infinite order .",
    "we will prove that the orbit of @xmath585 under iterations of @xmath499 is infinite .",
    "recall the definition of a head for a word over @xmath586 ending in @xmath535 ( see @xmath530 ) . for every word @xmath587 , we have @xmath588 .",
    "the automorphism @xmath499 has 6 distinct sections defined by @xmath589 since @xmath590 we see that the length of the head increases by 3 at each application of @xmath499 and @xmath129 has infinite order .",

    "this completes the proof .",

    "he proved that it is torsion free and that the monoid generated by @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 is free . here",
    "we provide his proofs and show that the group is not contracting .",
    "suppose there are some relations .",
    "let @xmath614 be a relation for which @xmath615 minimal .",
    "assume that none of the words @xmath27 and @xmath58 is empty . clearly , @xmath27 and @xmath58 end in different letters ( since cancelation holds )",
    ". then @xmath616 , where @xmath617 are permutations in @xmath618 .",

    "consider different cases .",
    "let @xmath27 end in @xmath130 and @xmath58 end in @xmath131 .",
    "then @xmath413 and @xmath621 both end in @xmath131 .",
    "this means , by minimality , that @xmath619 as words .",
    "thus , in particular , @xmath622 . since @xmath623 in @xmath613 ( their actions differ at level 1 ) the length of @xmath27 and @xmath58 is at least 2",
    ". we can unambiguously recover the second to last letter in @xmath27 and @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , the second to last letter in @xmath621 can be only @xmath130 or @xmath131 ( these are the only possible sections at 0 of the three generators ) , while the second to last letter of @xmath413 can be only @xmath129 or @xmath130 ( these are the only possible sections at 1 of the three generators ) .",
    "thus @xmath624 , @xmath625 , and @xmath626 . as @xmath627 in @xmath613 ( their actions differ at level 1 ) , the length of @xmath27 and @xmath58 is at least 3 . iterating the procedure",
    ", we obtain that @xmath628 , and therefore @xmath629 , @xmath630 . as @xmath622 ,",
    "the actions of @xmath27 and @xmath58 differ at level 1 and we get a contradiction .          for a group word @xmath27 over @xmath498 , define the exponent @xmath634 of @xmath129 in @xmath27 to be the sum of the exponents of all the occurrences of @xmath129 and @xmath635 in @xmath27 ( define @xmath636 and @xmath637 analogously ) .",

    "let @xmath569 . then @xmath644 also represent @xmath156 in @xmath613 and @xmath645",
    ". therefore @xmath413 and @xmath414 are not empty and , by minimality , their length must be equal to the length of @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that @xmath27 does not contain @xmath646 , @xmath647 , @xmath648 , or @xmath649 as a subword ( this is because @xmath650 and @xmath651 ) .",
    "by the same argument @xmath413 and @xmath414 must not have the above 4 words as subwords as well , implying that @xmath27 does not have @xmath652 or its inverse @xmath653 as a subword .",
    "thus , since @xmath27 is reduced , we have that @xmath654 , and we obtain a relation between positive words over @xmath498 , contradicting proposition  [ free ] .    note that if @xmath641 in @xmath613 then @xmath634 , @xmath636 and @xmath637 are even .",
    "indeed , clearly @xmath655 must be even ( by looking at action on level 1 ) , which implies by the previous lemma that @xmath637 is even .",
    "further , if @xmath569 , then also @xmath656 and @xmath657 are even .",
    "we have that @xmath658 , @xmath659 .",
    "therefore @xmath660 is even , implying that @xmath636 is even . since both @xmath636 and @xmath637 are",
    "even , so must be @xmath634 .",
    "suppose not .",
    "then @xmath613 has an element @xmath27 of order @xmath2 . by considering the sections we can also suppose that @xmath27 does not belong to the stabilizer of the first level , i.e. @xmath661 .",
    "it follows that @xmath662 .",
    "we have that , modulo 2 , @xmath663 .",
    "since @xmath664 is even , we conclude that @xmath655 is even , contradicting the assumption that @xmath27 does not stabilize the first level .",
    "the element @xmath665 is nontrivial ( the @xmath129 exponent is odd ) and therefore has infinite order by proposition  [ boltenkov_torsion_free ] .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath666 fixes vertex 1 and its section at this vertex is @xmath666 , implying that @xmath613 is not contracting .",
    "the group @xmath529 is a regular weakly branch group over @xmath671 .",
    "indeed , @xmath672\\cdot[b , a]=([a , b],1)$ ] .",
    "spherical transitivity and the self - replicating property then imply that @xmath673 .",
    "since @xmath529 is not abelian ( @xmath674 = ( b^{-1}ab , a^{-1 } ) \\neq 1 $ ] , because @xmath675 ) , @xmath671 is nontrivial and @xmath529 is a regular weakly branch over @xmath671 .",
    "we have @xmath676 , @xmath677 , and @xmath670 .",
    "thus @xmath501 fixes the vertex @xmath375 and has @xmath130 as a section at that vertex .",

    ", @xmath593 fixes vertex @xmath469 and has itself as a section at that vertex , implying that @xmath529 is not contracting .",
    "indeed , let @xmath27 be a nonempty word in @xmath678 .",
    "if @xmath641 in @xmath529 , then @xmath27 contains both @xmath129 and @xmath130 , because they both have infinite order ( @xmath129 has infinite order since @xmath679 ) .",
    "suppose the length of @xmath27 is minimal among all nonempty words over @xmath680 representing the identity element in @xmath681 .",
    "then one of the sections of @xmath27 will be shorter than @xmath27 ( since @xmath682 is trivial ) , nonempty ( since @xmath683 and @xmath684 are nontrivial ) , and will represent the identity in @xmath681 , which contradicts the minimality assumption .",
    "thus @xmath685 in @xmath681 , for any nonempty word in @xmath678 .",
