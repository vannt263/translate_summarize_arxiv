    "fe - based superconductors have been attracting considerable attention since their discovery in 2008.@xcite due to rich structural variety and signatures of high - temperature superconductivity similar or above iron arsenides , iron chalcogenide materials with fe - ch ( ch = s , se , te ) building blocks are of particular interest.@xcite recently , superconductivity below 5 k is found in tetragonal fes synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction.@xcite the superconducting state is multiband with nodal gap and large upper critical field anisotropy.@xcite local probe @xmath9sr measurements indicate two @xmath10-wave gaps but also a disordered impurity magnetism with small moment that microscopically coexists with bulk superconductivity below superconducting transition temperature.@xcite this is similar to fese at high pressures albeit with weaker coupling and larger coherence length.@xcite    binary iron chalcogenides show potential for high field applications.@xcite since fech tetrahedra could be incorporated in different superconducting materials , it is of interest to study critical currents and vortex pinning mechanism in tetragonal fes.@xcite moreover , vortex pinning and dynamics is strongly related to coherence length and superconducting pairing mechanism .    here",

    "fes and fes@xmath2se@xmath3 single crystals were synthesized by de - intercalation of potassium from k@xmath6fe@xmath7(se , s)@xmath8 single crystals , using the hydrothermal reaction method.@xcite first , 8 mmol fe powder , 5 mmol na@xmath8s@xmath139h@xmath8o , 5 mmol naoh , and 10 ml deionized water were mixed together and put into 25 ml teflon - lined steel autoclave .",

    "the linewidth is somewhat enhanced and is likely the consequence of small quadrupole splitting . if the lorentz singlet would be split into two lines , their centroids would have been 0.06 mm / s apart , which is the measure of quadrupole splitting ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the measured isomer shift is consistent with fe@xmath24 , in agreement with x - ray absorbtion and photoemission spectroscopy studies.@xcite there is very mild discrepancy of mssbauer theoretical curve when compared to observed values near 0.2 mm / s , most likely due to texture effects and small deviations of incident @xmath25 rays from the c - axis of the crystal .",

    "the critical current density @xmath0 can be calculated from mhl using the bean model.@xcite when the field is applied along @xmath26 axis , the in - plane critical current density @xmath29 is given by@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the width of magnetization loop at specific applied field value and is measured in emu/@xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the width and length of the sample ( @xmath33@xmath35@xmath34 ) and measured in cm .",
    "the @xmath0 used in the formula is the unrelaxed critical current density .",
    "practically measured critical current density , however , is the @xmath36 ( relaxed value ) .",
    "because magnetization relaxation is not very strong in iron - based superconductors , the @xmath36@xmath37@xmath0.@xcite the paramagnetic ( linear ) @xmath38 background has no effect on the calculation of @xmath23m(@xmath39h ) and consequently crucial currents due to its subtraction .",
    "the inclusion of ferromagnetic impurities@xcite is unlikely due to highly symmetric m(h ) loops ( fig .",
    "therefore we attribute somewhat reduced volume fraction in pure tetragonal fes to the presence of the unreacted paramagnetic hydrothermal solvent on the surface of our crystal , similar to what has been observed before.@xcite    figs .",

    "pinning force ( @xmath49 ) can provide useful insight into vortex dynamics .",
    "there is a peak in the pinning force density as a function of the reduced magnetic field for all hard high - field superconductors.@xcite according to dew - hughes model,@xcite , normalized vortex pinning force @xmath45 = @xmath50 should be proportional to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is normalized field , and @xmath53 is irreversibility field obtained by an extrapolation of @xmath54 to zero .",
    "parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 are determined by the pinning mechanism . as shown in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) , the curves of @xmath57 at different temperatures overlap well with each other , indicating that the same pinning mechanism dominate at the temperature range we study .",
    "fitting with scaling law @xmath51 gives @xmath55 = 0.42 , @xmath56 = 1.65 , and @xmath58 = 0.21 for fes and @xmath55 = 0.63 , @xmath56 = 2.34 , and @xmath58 = 0.21 for fes@xmath2se@xmath3 , roughly consistent with theoretical @xmath55 = 0.5 , @xmath56 = 2 , @xmath58 = 0.2 for core normal surface - like pinning .",
    "core normal surface - like pinning describes the pinning center from the microstructure and geometry aspect .",
    "the free energy of the flux lines in the pinning centers is different from that in the superconducting matrix and the pinning center is normal whereas the geometry of the pinning centers is two dimensional .",
    "weak and widely spaced pins induce a small peak in @xmath57 at high @xmath59 , while strong closely spaced pins produce a large peak at low @xmath59.@xcite similar @xmath59 indicates the strength and spacing of the pins is similar between two samples .    figure 4(c ) presents irreversibility field ( @xmath60 ) dependence of @xmath61 . both the pinning force and @xmath60",
    "are enhanced by se doping .",
    "the curves can be scaled by @xmath62 with @xmath63 = 2.0 for fes and 2.1 for fes@xmath2se@xmath3 , close to theoretical prediction ( @xmath63 = 2).@xcite since the tetragonal fes and fes@xmath2se@xmath3 were synthetized by de - intercalation of potassium using hydrothermal method and are cleaved along the @xmath26 axis much easier than other iron superconductors , it is likely that weakly connected surfaces are important in the flux pinning as opposed to k@xmath64fe@xmath7se@xmath65 , fese@xmath66te@xmath66 thin flim , and ba@xmath11k@xmath12fe@xmath8as@xmath8 where point - like pinning prevails.@xcite    in addition , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4(c ) , the reduced temperature dependence of @xmath60 can be fitted with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , which gives @xmath69 for fes and @xmath70 for fes@xmath2se@xmath3 .",
    "there are two primary mechanisms of core pinning from spatial variation of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) coefficient @xmath63 in type @xmath71 superconductors , corresponding to the spatial variation in transition @xmath27 ( @xmath4t@xmath48 pinning ) , or to charge carrier mean free path @xmath5 near lattice defects ( @xmath4@xmath5 pinning ) . in the case of @xmath4t@xmath48 pinning , @xmath72/@xmath73 @xmath74 ( 1-@xmath75)@xmath76(1+@xmath75)@xmath77 , whereas @xmath72/@xmath73 @xmath74 ( 1-@xmath75)@xmath78(1+@xmath75)@xmath79 for @xmath4@xmath5 pinning , where @xmath80 = @xmath81.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) , the reduced temperature dependence of reduced critical current density is nearly the same for fes and fes@xmath2se@xmath3 and is between the theoretical curves of @xmath4t@xmath48 pinning and @xmath4@xmath5 pinning .",
    "this suggests the presence of both microscopic mechanisms .",
    "each contribution can be estimated by @xmath82 .",
    "the fitting gives @xmath83 = 0.15 for fes , and @xmath83 = 0.17 for fes@xmath2se@xmath3 , indicating @xmath4@xmath5 pinning plays major role in fes and fes@xmath2se@xmath3 .",
    "the pinning mechanism is different from k@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath8 , where @xmath4@xmath27 pinning is prevalent , and is similar with yba@xmath8cu@xmath84o@xmath85 and nafe@xmath86co@xmath87as.@xcite due to intrinsic nanoscale phase separation in k@xmath6fe@xmath7se@xmath8@xcite @xmath4@xmath27 could play a major role in pinning , in contrast to tetragonal iron sulfide even though fes and fese@xmath3 single crystals are obtained from k@xmath6fe@xmath7(se , s)@xmath8 by de - intercalation .",
    "moreover , because fes is a typical type @xmath71 superconductors , the multigap might have an effect on the fitting result .",
    "nevertheless , the dew - hughes model still reveals that the @xmath88 pinning by dew - hughes model still gives an insight in the pinning mechanism .",
    "in summary , we report the increase in the critical current density in tetragonal fes single crystals by se doping . the core normal surface - like pinning is present in the vortex dynamics .",
    "the pinning is dominated by the variation of charge carrier mean free path @xmath5 near lattice defects ( @xmath4@xmath5 pinning ) . the critical current density is comparable to iron based superconductors with much higher superconducting transition temperature .",
    "this suggests that fes - based superconducting structures with higher @xmath1 s could exhibit high performance , potentially attractive for low temperature high magnetic field applications .",
