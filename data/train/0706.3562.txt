    "a critical stress threshold is often defined to characterize material resistance to rupture . when the applied stress is smaller than the threshold ,",
    "experiments show that rupture can still occur after a delay in time which decreases with the applied stress and with temperature @xcite .",
    "a widespread approach has been to relate time - dependent fracture to the creep properties of the material @xcite . in this general framework ,",
    "the creep law is an empirical material dependent property , the most common dependence on the applied stress proposed in the literature being either a power law or an arrhenius law .",
    "more recently , several authors have come back to a simpler situation where the material is elastic and subcritical rupture is thermally activated .",
    "the focus has been mainly on prediction of the rupture time ( or lifetime ) @xcite , but has also been extended to the slow growth of a single crack in brittle materials @xcite . in this letter , we present experimental results on the slow growth of a single crack in a sheet of paper which behaves as a quasi - brittle material .",
    "we show that the experimental results are compatible with a model of thermally activated crack growth in brittle materials when we take into account the microstructure of cellulose fibers in paper .",
    "crack growth is obtained by loading in mode 1 at a constant force @xmath0 a sheet of fax paper ( alrey ) with an initial crack in the center ( fig .",
    "[ f.1]a ) .",
    "the sample dimensions are : height @xmath3 , width @xmath4 , and thickness @xmath5 .",
    "the experimental set - up consists of a tensile machine driven by a motor ( micro controle @xmath6 ) controlled electronically to move step by step ( micro controle @xmath7 ) .",
    "the paper sheets are mounted on the tensile machine with both ends attached with glue tape and rolled twice over rigid bars clamped on jaws .",
    "the motor controls the displacement of one jaw ( @xmath8 steps per micrometer ) while the other jaw is rigidly fixed to a force gage ( hydrotonics - tc ) .",
    "the tensile machine is placed in a box with a humidity level stabilized at @xmath9 . in order to work on samples with the same initial crack shape and length @xmath10 , we use calibrated razor blades mounted on a micrometric screw and we initiate a macroscopic crack precisely at the center of the sheet .",
    "the samples are loaded by increasing the distance between the jaws such that the resulting force @xmath0 is perpendicular to the initial crack direction .",
    "a feedback loop allows us to adjust the displacement in order to keep the applied force @xmath0 constant with a precision better than @xmath11 and a response time less than @xmath12 . from the area @xmath13 of a cross - section of the sheet , @xmath13 being approximatively constant ,",
    "we calculate the applied stress @xmath14 .",
    "sheets of fax paper break in a brittle manner .",
    "this is evidenced by the elastic stress - strain dependence which is quasi - linear until rupture ( fig .",
    "[ f.1]b ) .",
    "another sign that rupture is essentially brittle is given by the very good match between the two opposite lips of the fracture surfaces observed on post - mortem samples .",
    "a sheet of paper is a complex network of cellulose fibers .",
    "scanning electron microscopy on our samples shows fiber diameters between @xmath15 and @xmath16 with an average of @xmath17 .",
    "cellulose fibers are themselves a bundle of many microfibrils .",
    "cellulose microfibrils have a cristalline structure ( therefore , they are very brittle ) and are consistently found to have a diameter @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the mechanical properties of paper depend crucially on the humidity rate . to get reproducible results ,",
    "the fax paper samples are kept at least one day at a low humidity level ( @xmath19 ) and during the experiment ( @xmath20 ) . at constant humidity level ( @xmath21 ) and room temperature ,",
    "the young modulus of the fax paper sheets is typically @xmath22 .",
    "we light the samples from the back .",
    "a high resolution and high speed digital camera ( photron ultima 1024 ) collects the transmitted light and allows us to follow the crack growth .",
    "we observe that the global deformation of the paper sheet during a creep experiment is correlated in a rather reproducible way to the crack growth whatever the rupture time .",
    "we use this property to trigger the camera at fixed increment of elongation ( one micron ) rather than at fixed increment in time .",
    "this avoids saturation of the onboard memory card when the crack growth is slow and makes the acquisition rate faster when the crack grows faster and starts to have an effect on global deformation .",
    "we acquire @xmath23 frames at @xmath24 at each trigger and obtain around one thousand images per experiment .",
    "image analysis is performed to extract the length of the crack projected on the main direction of propagation , i.e. perpendicular to the direction of the applied load ( fig .",
    "[ extract_l ] ) .",
    "although the crack actually follows a sinuous trajectory , its projected length @xmath25 gives the main contribution to the stress intensity factor @xmath26 which we compute as : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 takes into account the finite height @xmath29 of the paper sheet @xcite .",
    "for a given initial crack length @xmath10 , subcritical crack growth is obtained by applying a constant force @xmath0 so that @xmath30 is smaller than the critical rupture threshold of the material @xmath31 above which fast crack propagation would occur . during an experiment , the crack length increases , and so does the stress intensity factor @xmath32 .",
    "this will cause the crack to accelerate until it reaches the critical length @xmath33 for which @xmath34 .    on fig .",
    "[ growth]a we show a typical growth curve obtained during a creep experiment with an applied force @xmath35 and an initial crack length @xmath36 . since time to rupture @xmath1 is a statistical quantity , we prefer to plot time evolution as a function of the crack length . we observe that the crack growth is actually intermittent .",
    "essentially , there are periods of rest during which the crack tip is pinned and does not move , and also moments when the crack suddenly opens and advances of a certain step size @xmath37 .",
    "the crack advances by jumps until it reaches a critical length @xmath33 where the paper sheet breaks suddenly",
    ". measurements of @xmath33 are used to estimate the critical stress intensity factor @xmath38 . beyond @xmath33 ,",
    "the crack runs across the whole sample ( about @xmath39 in this case ) in less than one second , with a crack speed @xmath40 . for the same experimental conditions ( same stress , same initial crack length , same temperature and same humidity rate ) , we observe a strong dispersion in growth curves and in lifetime while the critical length seems to be rather well defined ( see insert in fig .",

    "in this part , we are going to describe a model that is able to reproduce several of the experimental features that we have just described .",
    "first , we recall that the experimental crack growth curves have been obtained by performing a statistical average on many experiments in the same condition",
    ". the model will also be a statistical one .",
    "we are going to consider that in average the crack growth proceeds by breaking individual cellulose fibers at the crack tip . still in average , the fibers who resist to the applied load",
    "will be considered parallel to each other and perpendicular to the crack direction .",
    "if @xmath71 is the typical diameter of a fiber and @xmath72 is the mean rupture time for the cellulose fiber at the crack tip , the mean crack velocity is : @xmath73 . in that way ,",
    "the increase in crack velocity as the crack length increases will correspond to a decrease of the rupture time @xmath72 .",
    "whatever is the rupture mechanism , we expect that the rupture time @xmath72 is going to depend on the applied load @xmath74 on the fiber at the crack tip .",
    "equivalently , we can refer to the applied stress @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the cross - sectional area of the fiber .",
    "we estimate @xmath77 assuming that the fiber acts as a cohesive zone of length @xmath71 and that the rest of the material behaves as an elastic continuum for a crack with a length @xmath78 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider that the crack is at equilibrium if the elastic field presents no divergence of stress .",
    "this condition imposes that the stress level in the fiber is controlled by the size of the fiber and can be estimated as : @xmath79 . in our calculations , we will take @xmath80 where @xmath26 is the stress intensity factor .",
    "a common approach to describe the creep rupture of materials is to introduce a time - dependent creep compliance or a rate of rupture which is a power law of the applied stress . instead of assuming a phenomenological law for the creep behavior",
    ", we are going to use a statistical approach that has been developed in the case of brittle materials to describe the rupture of fiber bundles .",
    "this approach is appropriate in the case of a cellulose fiber because it is actually a bundle of many identical brittle microfibrils .",
    "the idea of the rupture mechanism is that at equilibrium there are always statistical fluctuations of stress with a variance depending on the actual temperature of the material .",
    "taking into account the probability that such stress fluctuations exceed the rupture threshold @xmath81 of individual fibers in the bundle , it is possible to make some prediction on the rupture dynamics of a fiber bundle . in an homogenous fiber bundle where all the fibers have the same rupture thresholds , it was shown that the rupture time is @xcite : @xmath82\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is boltzmann constant , @xmath68 is temperature , @xmath84 is the elastic stiffness of the fibers , @xmath85 is the applied force per fiber when the bundle is still intact , and @xmath81 is the rupture threshold of the fibers .",
    "we can rewrite this expression in term of the young modulus @xmath86 , the applied stress on the fiber @xmath77 and the rupture threshold @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath88 is the section area of a microfibril , we have @xmath89 and @xmath90 . rupture in a microfibril is expected to occur in a small piece of the fiber with a length @xmath91 much smaller than the total fiber length .",
    "the relation between the stiffness @xmath84 of this piece and the young modulus is then : @xmath92 . introducing the volume @xmath93",
    ", we see that the rupture time can be written as : @xmath94\\ ] ] it must be understood that in this formula @xmath95 represents the volume in which rupture of the microfibril actually occurs .",
    "since the microfibril is broken whenever we cut a section through , it is physically reasonable to consider that the length @xmath91 of the piece involved in rupture will be comparable to the microfibril diameter @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we will expect to have @xmath97 .",
    "the expression obtained for @xmath72 gives an exponential dependence of the crack growth velocity .",
    "if we integrate this velocity following the procedure described in @xcite , we recover eq .",
    "( [ eq.growth ] ) where the rupture time is : @xmath98 and the characteristic growth length @xmath2 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the value of @xmath77 when @xmath101 .",
    "writing explicitly the dependence of stresses on @xmath0 , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ eqzeta ] ) that @xmath102 in agreement with the experimental observations ( fig .",
    "[ zeta]a ) .",
    "we have also @xmath103 but this dependence is difficult to verify experimentally because the ratio @xmath104 does not change much . in fig .",
    "[ zeta]b , we see that there is a reasonable agreement between the experimental value of @xmath2 and the theoretical one @xmath105 $ ] . using @xmath95 as a free parameter",
    ", we find a characteristic scale @xmath106 close to the microfibril diameter @xmath96 .",
    "the form of the energy barrier @xmath107 in the arrhenius law ( eq .  ( [ eqtau ] ) ) is analogous to the one obtained for example in @xcite .",
    "note also that it is not simply a function of the external load @xmath108 as in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig.lifetime]b , we plot the rupture time as a function of @xmath109 .",
    "we observe that the data points obtained by varying temperature are now collapsing with the one obtained at fixed temperature ( the dispersion in this figure remains large because data as a function of temperature and constant @xmath0 and @xmath10 have been averaged less than those at constant temperature for technical reasons ) . from a fit of the data , we obtain independently a new estimate of @xmath95 which gives a characteristic scale @xmath110 .",
    "once again this estimate is close to the microfibril diameter @xmath96 .",
    "we have studied the subcritical growth of a single crack in a sheet of paper during creep experiments .",
    "we have shown that statistically the crack growth curves can be well described with only two parameters : the rupture time @xmath1 and a characteristic growth length @xmath2 .",
    "we have proposed a model which is able to reproduce the shape of the growth curves as well as the dependence of @xmath2 with the applied load and the influence of temperature on the rupture time .",
    "the model takes advantage of the fact cellulose fibers are actually a bundle of many small brittle fibers with a diameter of nanometer scale .",
    "a previous prediction of the rupture time for thermally activated rupture of brittle fibers has been used to derive the crack velocity .",
    "we find that the experimental data are compatible with the idea that rupture occurs at a nanometric scale in the cellulose fibers .",
    "while the model we used work rather well , it remains to understand if the experimental results could be as well described by time - dependent fracture models based on the material rheological properties .",
