    "hh  80/81/80n is a spectacular and very luminous hh outflow spanning about 5  pc and exhibiting proper motions , close to the exciting source , of up to 1400  km  s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "hh  80n , the northern counterpart of hh  80/81 , is optically invisible , due to the high extinction at this position ( mart et al .",
    "1993 ) , but its radio and far - infrared properties confirm its hh nature ( mart et al .  1993 ; molinari et al .",
    "far - infrared iso observations show that the strong fuv field radiated by the hh  80/81/80n outflow have induced the formation of a pdr ( photo - dissociation region ) in its immediately surrounding region ( molinari et al .",
    "2001 ) .    molecular line observations towards hh  80n  @xcite showed that it belongs to the class of herbig - haro ( hh hereafter ) objects , typically of high excitation , that are found to have starless quiescent dense clumps ahead of them .",
    "the strong radiation arising from the hh objects penetrates the clumps , releasing the icy mantles from the dust grains and inducing a photon - dominated chemistry , which causes significantly altered chemistry @xcite .",
    "recent observations towards hh  2 have confirmed this chemical scenario ( girart et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "however , the presence of iras  18163 - 2042 associated with the hh  80n  dense clump suggested that it could be tracing an embedded star ( girart et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "this paper presents cs and co bima observations that are part of a molecular line survey towards hh  80n  whose complete results will be reported in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the observations presented in this paper show infall and outflow signatures associated with the dense clump downstream of hh  80n .",
    "the high angular resolution provided by millimeter interferometers , as in this paper , have allowed astronomers to resolve spatially infall kinematical signatures in some low mass star forming cores @xcite .",
    "typically , the infalling gas arises from scales of @xmath4@xmath5  au and the mass infall rates are 110@xmath6  @xmath3  yr@xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the infall signatures found in hh  80n  are similar to that from the dense cores in l1544 @xcite and hh  1/2 @xcite , which show infall signatures in the form of an almost ring - like structure in the position - velocity diagram on even larger scales , @xmath7 and @xmath8  au , respectively .",
    "the observations were carried out between 1999 may and september with the 10-antenna bima array at the hat creek radio observatory . the phase calibrator used was qso 1733 - 130 .",
    "absolute flux calibration was performed by observing uranus and mars .",
    "the phase center of the observations was @xmath9 ; @xmath10 .",
    "two different frequency setups were used in order to observe the cs  and co  lines , which provided a spectral resolution of 0.3 and 0.5  km  s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "maps were made with the @xmath11 data weighted by the associated system temperatures .",
    "the cs emission arises from an elongated structure in the nw to se direction ( @xmath12 ) , consisting of two well differentiated structures morphologically and kinematically ( see figures  [ fmapa ] , [ fposvel ] ) : ( 1 ) the main core is centered at the position of the ammonia core @xcite .",
    "the position - velocity plot along the major axis of the cs emission shows an ring - like structure , roughly symmetrical about @xmath13  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this structure can be explained by inward ( or outwards ) motions in the condensation ( see   [ cau ] ) and resembles that from the starless core l1544 @xcite .",
    "the physical scale of the dense main core traced by the cs emission , @xmath14  pc ( assuming a distance of 1.7  kpc : mart et al .",
    "1993 ) is larger than that from the nh@xmath15 ( 1,1 ) @xcite and the hco@xmath16  ( girart et al .",
    "this could be due to the higher critical density of these two lines with respect to the cs  transition .",
    "( 2 ) a small redshifted  arm  ( hereafter rse arm ) is located se of the main core and @xmath17 north of the 6  cm continuum emission .",
    "the rse arm exhibits a clear linear velocity gradient with increasing velocity towards the east , i.e. ,  as it gets closer to hh  80n .",
    "table  [ fisica ] shows the physical parameters of the core traced by the cs  line . of the total mass measured , 12  @xmath3  ( assuming @xmath18 ) , around 10  @xmath3   belong to the main core , and 2  @xmath3  to the rse arm .",
    "the blueshifted and redshifted co emission traces a clearly bipolar outflow along the e - w direction ( lobes be and rw ) and approximately centered at the peak intensity of the cs integrated emission ( fig .",
    "[ fmapa ] ) .",
    "the presence of molecular outflows is a clear signpost of star formation within the dense core .",
    "the outflow axis is not perpendicular to the major axis of the main core .",
    "however , our angular resolution traces scales ( @xmath19  au ) much larger than the scales at which the collimation process occurs , @xmath20  au @xcite .",
    "table  [ fisica ]  shows the physical parameters of the molecular outflow .",
    "there is marginal evidence of another bipolar outflow in the n - s direction and also centered in the dense core .",
    "in addition to the molecular outflow , there is a redshifted clump that coincides not only spatially with the rse arm but also kinematically , suggesting that this co emission traces the same gas as the cs at this location .",
    "the position - velocity plot along the major and the minor axes of the cs emission ( fig .  [ fposvel ] ) clearly suggests that the gas is either collapsing or expanding radially and that the emission arises from a ring - like or toroidal structure .",
    "a similar structure has being observed towards the starless core l1554 from ccs observations @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the major and minor axes of the cs emission gives an inclination angle of @xmath21 . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the fact that the emission is detected towards a ring - like structure is probably due to a chemical effect , i.e. ,  a decrease of the cs abundance toward the center , possibly because of gas depletion onto grains at higher densities @xcite .",
    "we considered a model of a spatially thin ring with both infall and rotation , similar to that of @xcite , seen edge - on by the observer .",
    "the parameters of the model were the inner and outer radii of the ring , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the infall and rotation velocities , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the intrinsic line width @xmath26 .",
    "the position - velocity diagram was computed along the projected major and minor axes of the ring , assuming that the intensity was constant for @xmath27 , to compare with the observed kinematics .",
    "the best fit was obtained for velocities @xmath28  km  s@xmath2 , @xmath29  km  s@xmath2 , and radii of the ring @xmath30  pc , @xmath31  pc ( see table  [ fisica ] ) .",
    "the observed and synthetic position - velocity diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fposvel ] .",
    "this model also applies if the ring is expanding instead of contracting . in this case",
    ", the derived infall velocity should be taken as the expantion velocity .",
    "can the protostellar wind cause the expansion of a ring - like structure ?",
    "the momentum rate of the ring ( see table  [ fisica ] ) is @xmath32  @xmath3  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2 . on the other hand , the momentum rate of the protostellar wind , assuming that it is the same as that from the molecular outflow , is @xmath33  @xmath3  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2 .",
    "although both values are similar , only a small fraction of the wind momentum rate would be transfered to the dense core .",
    "first , the dense core , as traced by the cs , shows a relatively flattened structure . assuming that the ring structure traced by the cs is a torus ,",
    "then the inner and outer radius derived from the model will imply a semi - aperture angle of the torus as seen from the center of @xmath34 .",
    "second , the momentum rate distribution of the wind is expected to be anisotropic , i.e. ,  most of the momentum rate of the wind is carried out along the axis of the outflow , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the x - wind model @xcite predicts that at a distance of 0.24  pc the fraction of wind mass moving at equatorial angles lower than @xmath34 is about 2% of the total wind mass .",
    "we expect the momentum rate to scale similarly .",
    "thus the wind that could interact with the dense core has roughly a momentum rate @xmath35  @xmath3  km  s@xmath2  yr@xmath2 , which is much lower than that measured from the cs kinematics , assuming a typical cs abundance of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the wind would be able to cause the expansion of the ring only if the cs has an unusually high abundance , and if the true momentum rate is much higher than that measured , because of the outflow inclination and the optical depth .",
    "can the ring - like structure be in contraction ?",
    "@xcite found that the ammonia emission arises from a smaller region than the cs  and traces a 20  @xmath3  core ( see   [ resul ] ) .",
    "this mass is similar to that required to cause free - fall collapse for the infall velocity measured at a radius of @xmath36  pc .",
    "however , the gas pressure and magneticc field should be taken into account .",
    "for the intrinsic line width obtained from the model , the virial mass without magnetic field for the cs main core is 9  @xmath3 .",
    "this indicates that in the absence of the magnetic field the gas pressure can not prevent the collapse . assuming that the ring - like structure is contracting",
    ", we can provide a rough upper limit on @xmath37 , i.e. ,  the main core should be supercritical and the total virial mass ( including the magnetic fields ) should be no more than the free - fall mass . following the formulae given by @xcite and @xcite we find that for a mass of 20  @xmath3  the collapse is possible for @xmath38 g .",
    "magnetic fields of @xmath39 g have been measured in several molecular clouds with similar sizes and line widths as those of hh  80n  @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that there is enough mass to cause collapse while , on the other hand , an expansion would require an unusually high cs abundace and a high correction to the observed co momentum rate . therefore , we favour that the cs kinematics is tracing infall .    compared with most of the low mass regions where a kinematical infall signature has been found ( see   [ intro ] ) , the hh  80n  main core has a larger mass infall rate ( see table  [ fisica ] ) .",
    "this is probably because it is also a more massive region .",
    "another example is the infalling nh@xmath15 core in hh  1/2 @xcite , where the infall material also comes from a ring - like structure ( toroid ) with a similar size and mass as the hh  80n  main core .",
    "interestingly , the hh  80n  and hh  1/2 star forming cores show clear differences with the other collapsing ring - like structures detected so far . here , the infalling motions are clearly supersonic with no rotation observed , whereas the infall motions in the starless core l1544 are subsonic and of the order of the rotation speeds @xcite .",
    "these differences could be due to an evolutionary effect ( l1544 is still a starless core ) and/or to the different masses involved in the collapse .",
    "the powering source of hh  1/2 is a protostar with an far - ir luminosity of @xmath40  @xmath41@xcite , but what about hh  80n ?",
    "iras  18163 - 2042 has a luminosity of @xmath42  @xmath41  @xcite , but because of the large position uncertainty it is possible that both the pdr region heated by hh  80n  ( molinari et al .",
    "2001 ) and the protostar embedded in the infalling core contribute to this luminosity , therefore , this value is a rough upper limit of the protostellar luminosity .    a detailed study of the outflow activity , from a homogeneous sample of low - luminosity embedded ysos , done by @xcite found that the relation between the outflow momentum flux , the envelope mass and the bolometric luminosity depends on the evolutionary stage of the protostars . in particular , the relation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which should be almost free of any distance and luminosity effects , is useful to distinguish the evolutionary stage of the low mass ysos , that is , whether they are in the class 0 or i stage .",
    "the values of the measured envelope mass and the corrected momentum rate , @xmath45 ( the same inclination and opacity correction factor used by bontemps et al .",
    "1996 ) , suggest that , for the possible range of bolometric luminosities ( @xmath4620  @xmath41 ) , the hh  80n  dense core is in the class 0 evolutionary stage .",
    "@xcite also found that the momentum flux and the envelope mass are well correlated for both class 0 and i objects .",
    "however , taking into account the momentum flux of the hh  80n  molecular outflow , the dense core is an order of magnitude more massive than what is expected from this correlation .",
    "the excess of envelope mass with respect to the outflow strength could be explained if there is multiple star formation going on ( e.g. ,  if at unresolved scales the core splits into several clumps , with some of them still pre - stellar ) .",
    "there are two observational features that suggests that hh80/81/80n outflow may be interacting with the ambient gas surrounding the infalling main core : first , the clear velocity gradient of the rse arm seen in both cs and co emission and its location just above hh  80n  ( see fig .  [ fposvel ] ) .",
    "second , the be lobe of the molecular outflow spreads out to the north at the position where it coincides spatially with the axis of the hh80/81/80n outflow ( see fig .  [ fmapa ] : the arrow line indicates the outflow direction of hh  80n ) .",
    "this scenario , where hh  80n  and the dense gas are almost co - spatial , suggests that the infalling dense core and the rse arm may still be affected chemically by the strong uv radiation of hh  80n , as suggested by girart et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1998 ) , since this radiation is so strong that it has created a pdr region in its closest vicinity ( molinari et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that hh  80n  triggered the star formation within the main core : assuming a hh  80n  propagation speed of 100300  km  s@xmath2 , and using the typical age of a class 0 source for the yso embedded in the main core , @xmath47  yrs , hh  80n  would have to be about 1 to 3  pc away from the main core when the collapse was initiated .",
    "yet , the material from the hh80/81/80n flow was likely present near to the cs core before hh  80n  arrived to its proximity : a giant bow shock is observed dowstream of hh80/81 ( heathcote et al .",
    "1998 ) and the analysis of the line emission from hh80/81/80n shows that the shocks arise at the interface between two fast - moving flows ( molinari et al .",
    "therfore , it is still possible that the hh80/81/80n outflow has triggered or at least speed up the star formation .",
    "there are many uncertainties in our understanding of the dynamics of collapse ; these dynamics are determined by the balance of gravity against pressure . once the collapse is triggered , it is yet not clear how infall proceeds since thermal and non - thermal pressure may support the clump from collapsing , or at least retard an , often assumed , free - fall collapse @xcite . in the case of",
    "hh  80n , the uv radiation from the shock front may play an important role in the dynamics of the collapse of the dense core since it will highly affect its cooling function .",
    "@xcite showed that the radiation generated in the hh shock drives a rapid chemistry in the dense core , by lifting the icy mantles and therefore enhancing the gas with hydrogenated species , such as nh@xmath15 and h@xmath48o ; the latter , for example , will undoubtedly cool the gas .",
    "this would ` encourage ' the infall .",
    "this scenario will be investigated in a further paper .",
