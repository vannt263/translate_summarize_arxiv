    "( kay  wald  @xcite , 1987 ) let @xmath19 be schwarzschild with parameter @xmath20 , @xmath6 as above the closure of its domain of outer communications , @xmath1 a cauchy surface for @xmath5 and @xmath4 the unique solution of the wave equation @xmath16 on @xmath5 with sufficiently regular initial data @xmath21 on @xmath1 , decaying appropriately near spatial infinity @xmath22 .",
    "then there exists a @xmath23 depending only on the data such that @xmath24 holds in @xmath6 .    before turning to the main conceptual difficulty of the proof of the above theorem ,",
    "let us make some general remarks .",
    "the proofs of all theorems to be discussed in this talk use `` energy type estimates '' to control square integral quantities of @xmath4 and its derivatives ; pointwise bounds are retrieved at the last stage from these energy integrals and a sobolev inequality . of @xmath16 ( in more than one spatial dimension ) which do not lose derivatives . ]",
    "energy estimates for @xmath16 have a very geometric origin which is intimately related to its lagrangian structure .",
    "let us briefly explain .",
    "associated to the lagrangian for @xmath16 is the so called energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 for a solution @xmath4 to @xmath16 , @xmath26 is divergence - free , i.e. @xmath27    given any vector field @xmath28 , we may associate to it two currents : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the so called deformation tensor of @xmath28 .",
    "the relation @xmath31 yields @xmath32 for solutions @xmath4 of @xmath16 . thus , by the divergence theorem if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are homologous hypersurfaces bounding a spacetime region @xmath35 , we have @xmath36    when @xmath28 is timelike and @xmath37 is spacelike , then @xmath38 , and in fact controls the spacetime gradient of @xmath4 . if @xmath28 is in addition killing , then @xmath39 , and @xmath40 would provide an estimate for the solution on @xmath34 from knowledge of the solution on @xmath33 ( `` data '' ) . even when @xmath28 is not killing , @xmath41 can sometimes be treated as an error term . can be proven by using @xmath40 for an arbitrary timelike @xmath28 . ]",
    "one can also turn the identity @xmath40 on its head , and think about it as a way to estimate @xmath42 from the boundary terms .",
    "( think about the classical virial theorem  ) this is particularly useful when the boundary terms are controlled by a controlled energy say , and when @xmath43 and controls derivatives of @xmath4 .",
    "both uses of @xmath40 will arise in what follows .      in order to obtain pointwise bounds via energy control",
    ", one must consider `` higher order energies '' .",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath44 is a vector field in the lie algrebra of isometries of @xmath45 .",
    "then if @xmath4 satisfies @xmath16 , then so does @xmath46 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath47 are in the lie algebra , and @xmath4 satisfies @xmath16 , then so does @xmath48 . given a multiplier vector field @xmath28",
    ", we may thus consider the @xmath49th order currents @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "again , @xmath52 , and @xmath40 allows for proving higher - oder energy estimates .",

    "see the beautiful discussion in  @xcite .",
    "let us turn now to the proof of the kay ",
    "wald theorem , so as to see the main difficulty . in kay and wald s proof ,",
    "the only vector field used as a multiplier is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a schwarzschild coordinate ( in which the metric takes the schwarzschild form @xmath59 in the interior of @xmath6 ) . recall that the vector field @xmath60 extends to a killing field on all @xmath5 ,",
    "is timelike in the interior of @xmath6 , and null on its boundary @xmath61 , vanishing on the sphere of bifurcation @xmath62 .    without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that our cauchy surface @xmath1 intersected with @xmath6 is as depicted below by @xmath63 : @xmath64 we may define a regular coordinate system @xmath65 in @xmath66 such that @xmath63 corresponds to @xmath67 and @xmath60 still corresponds to @xmath68 .",
    "we may define then @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath70 , where @xmath71 denotes the one - parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath60 .",
    "let us apply the energy identity of @xmath72 in the region bounded by @xmath63 , @xmath73 , and the corresponding piece of @xmath74 .",
    "on @xmath73 , one has @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 denote here the induced norm and connection in the @xmath78 group orbits .",
    "note the degeneration of the @xmath79 derivative at @xmath80 .",
    "this arises because @xmath60 becomes null on @xmath74 .",
    "since the flux through the horizon is nonnegative @xmath81 we have @xmath82    commuting with @xmath60 , i.e.  considering the current @xmath83 and @xmath84 , one obtains @xmath85 with @xmath4 replaced by @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "an elliptic estimate and the sobolev inequality suffices to show that if @xmath88 , then @xmath89 in @xmath90 .",
    "the above argument is in fact completely standard and yields the statement of the theorem but where @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath91 .",
    "thus , it provides no information about the behaviour of @xmath4 along @xmath74 where @xmath92 ! _ understanding the behaviour up to and including the horizon is thus the only real difficulty of this problem in the schwarzschild case . _",
    "this difficulty is overcome by kay and wald by the following argument : one first notices that if there exists a @xmath93 satisfying @xmath16 such that @xmath94 , then one can estimate @xmath4 by a suitable sobolev inequality from the energies of @xmath93 on @xmath95 , providing one also commute with all angular momentum operators @xmath96 .",
    "such a @xmath93 can be constructed if it is assumed that @xmath4 is not supported in a neighborhood of @xmath62 , by inverting an elliptic operator on @xmath63 .",
    "( this was in fact an earlier observation of wald . )",
    "more generally , @xmath93 can be constructed if @xmath4 decays suitably to @xmath97 at @xmath98 . but what to do in the general case where @xmath4 is not assumed to have special behaviour at @xmath62",
    "?    here comes the second clever observation : since one is only interested in the behaviour in @xmath90 , one can replace @xmath4 by a solution @xmath99 of @xmath16 such that @xmath100 in @xmath90 . using the domain of dependence property for the wave equation , the discrete symmetry of ( extended ) schwarzschild interchanging the two ends , and a preservation of symmetry argument , one can construct a @xmath99 with the desired behaviour at @xmath62 .",
    "one can then construct @xmath101 and continue as before .",
    "see  @xcite or  @xcite for more details .",
    "the above proof is remarkable , but fragile ! it requires ( i ) the staticity property to construct @xmath93 , ( ii ) the spherical symmetry of schwarzschild as one must commute @xmath16 with @xmath96 , @xmath102 , and , finally , even ( iii ) the discrete symmetry of schwarzschild .",
    "is it really the case that a result so fundamental as boundedness must depend on all this special structure of schwarzschild ?",
    "the difficulties of the proof arise because the set of multipliers and commutators are restricted to the killing fields @xmath60 , and @xmath96 .",
    "there is another important physical property of schwarzschild which is not apparent from these alone : we discuss this in the next section .",
    "the _ red - shift effect _ is one of the most celebrated aspects of black holes .",
    "it is classically described as follows : suppose two observers , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are such that @xmath103 crosses the event horizon and @xmath104 does not . if @xmath103 emits a signal at constant frequency as he measures it , then the frequency at which it is received by @xmath104 is `` shifted to the red '' .",
    "@xmath105 the consequences of this for the appearance of a collapsing star to far - away observers were first explored in the seminal paper of oppenheimer - snyder  @xcite .",
    "the red - shift effect as described above is a global one , and essentially depends only on the fact that the proper time of @xmath104 is infinite whereas the proper time of @xmath103 before crossing @xmath106 is finite . in the case of the schwarzschild black hole",
    ", there is a `` local '' version of this red - shift : if @xmath104 also crosses the event horizon but at advanced time later than @xmath103 : @xmath107 then the frequency at which @xmath104 receives at his horizon crossing time is shifted to the red by a factor depending exponentially on the advanced time difference of the crossing points of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the exponential factor is determined by the so - called _ surface gravity _ , a quantity that can in fact be defined for all so - called killing horizons .",
    "this localised red - shift effect depends only on the positivity of this quantity .",
    "it turns out that the local red - shift effect can be captured by positivity properties in the energy identity of a suitably constructed vector field multiplier applied both to @xmath4 alone and to @xmath4 commuted with a suitably constructed vector field commutator .",
    "@xcite there exists a smooth vector field @xmath108 , and two positive constants @xmath109 such that @xmath108 is timelike and @xmath110-invariant such that @xmath111 along @xmath106 , for all solutions @xmath4 of @xmath112 .",
    "a vector - field commutator version can be seen by    @xcite under the assumptions of the above theorem , let @xmath113 , and extend @xmath60 , @xmath114 to a null frame @xmath115 on @xmath106 . if @xmath4 satisfies @xmath112 , then for all @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 on @xmath106 , where @xmath118 .",
    "these propositions apply in particular to the schwarzschild metric , but in fact , their domain of validity is much more general : they apply to any stationary black hole with event horizon with positive surface gravity .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the above `` positive terms '' , @xmath119 and @xmath120 can be viewed as exponential damping terms in the energy identities with @xmath108 as a multiplier , and more generally , @xmath108 as a multiplier applied to @xmath4 commuted with @xmath121 .",
    "of course , these nice properties hold only near the horizon . thus , to use these identities one must apply these estimates _ in conjunction _ with a statement giving good control away from the horizon .",
    "in the case of schwarzschild , this good control follows from the first part of the argument described below , i.e.  from application of @xmath60 to @xmath4 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "this allows for a proof of the following stronger boundedness statement .",
    "@xcite let @xmath19 be schwarzschild and @xmath73 as above .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath122 depending only on @xmath123 , @xmath63 such that for all @xmath4 satisfying @xmath112 , the following holds : @xmath124    moreover , for all @xmath125 , the @xmath126th order pointwise bounds @xmath127 hold in @xmath90 , where @xmath128 is an appropriate norm on initial data .",
    "the above theorem is stronger than the kay and wald statement in that it proves the uniform boundedness of an `` energy '' which does not degenerate in local coordinates on the horizon .- invariant family of freely falling observers is proven bounded .",
    "] moreover , this boundedess is proven for arbitrary higher order energies , leading to pointwise bounds for arbitrary derivatives , including transversal derivatives to the horizon .",
    "_ it is interesting to remark that the kay ",
    "wald argument can not prove the uniform boundedness of these transversal derivatives .",
    "_      the above proof now is much more robust .",
    "in fact , it can be perturbed to nearby metrics as long as one retains @xmath106 as a null boundary and @xmath60 as killing and causal :    @xcite let @xmath90 , @xmath60 be as before , and let @xmath45 be a metric on @xmath90 sufficiently close to schwarzschild such that @xmath60 is killing and causal on @xmath90 , and @xmath106 is null with respect to @xmath45",
    ". then the statement of the previous theorem applies verbatim .    in view of the remarks at the end of section  [ red ]",
    ", it follows that one may weaken the assumption `` @xmath45 sufficiently close to schwarzschild '' , replacing it with the assumption that the geometry is that of a black hole with positive surface gravity .",
    "this and the remaining assumptions are then in particular satisfied by all the classical static electrovacuum black holes ( reissner - nordstrm - de sitter , etc . )",
    "moreover , one need not assume that @xmath60 is killing , merely that @xmath129 decays appropriately in @xmath130 .",
    "see  @xcite for details .",
    "_ what about kerr ? _ unfortunately , for all @xmath131 , the stationary vector field @xmath60 of the kerr metric @xmath132 is no longer causal in the interior of @xmath6 and thus @xmath132 does not satisfy the assumptions of the above theorem ! in particular , @xmath133 does not hold and we can thus no longer a priori infer the uniform boundedness of @xmath134 from the energy identity of @xmath72 .",

    "superradiance_. the test - particle manifestation of this fact is the celebrated _ penrose process_. see  @xcite for a nice discussion .",
    "the above suggests that it may be difficult to prove boundedness alone , and that of necessity one must try to prove more than boundedness at the same time , i.e.  decay .",

    "let us point out a central feature of its statement : the energy decay estimate @xmath146 `` loses '' derivatives , that is to say , one needs control of more derivatives initially on @xmath1 to estimate the energy later on @xmath147 .",
    "this is an essential aspect of the problem and has to do with * trapping * , i.e.  the fact that there are null geodesics neither crossing the event horizon nor approaching null infinity .",

    "nonetheless , it turns out that using ideas from the decay proof , we can indeed perturb _ just the boundedness theorem _ for geometries @xmath45 `` near '' schwarzschild , provided that @xmath45 retains two of the killing fields of schwarzschild ( @xmath60 and @xmath210 say ) , and a certain geometric property .    unlike the theorem of section  [ perturb ? ] , the class of spacetimes allowed will in particular include the kerr case for @xmath17 .",
    "let us first state the theorem    @xcite let @xmath90 be as before , @xmath45 be a metric defined on @xmath90 , and let @xmath60 and @xmath211 be schwarzschild killing fields .",
    "assume    1 .",
    "@xmath45 is close to schwarzschild in an appropriate sense 2 .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath212 are killing with respect to @xmath45 3 .",
    "@xmath106 is null with respect to @xmath45 , and @xmath60 and @xmath212 together span the null generator of @xmath106 .",
    "then the uniform boundedness theorem of section  [ stronger ] holds .",
    "in particular , the theorem applies to kerr for @xmath213 , kerr - newman for @xmath213 , @xmath18 , etc .",
    "the heuristic idea of the proof of this result is actually quite simple . consider a metric @xmath45 as described above , i.e.  retaining the killing fields @xmath60 and @xmath212 of schwarzschild , and suitable close to schwarzschild .    via the fourier transfrom",
    ", we associate frequencies @xmath214 , @xmath215 to the killing fields @xmath60 and @xmath212 , where @xmath216 , and @xmath217 .",
    "suppose we could decompose @xmath218 where @xmath219 is supported in @xmath220 and @xmath221 is supported in @xmath222 .",
    "the crucial observation is simply the following : _ for @xmath223 small enough , and for @xmath45 close enough to schwarzschild , then in view of the geometric assumption 3 .  on the killing fields",
    ", it follows that ( i ) there is no superradiance for @xmath224 , and ( ii ) there is no trapping for @xmath225 . _    that is to say , for appropriate choice of @xmath223 , ( i ) the current @xmath226 has a nonnegative flux through the horizon @xmath74 , and ( ii ) a variant of the @xmath151 vector field can be constructed , so that @xmath227 is nonnegative . in view of the absence of trapping ,",
    "the current @xmath227 need not degenerate near @xmath148 , and its construction is quite simple relative to section  [ xconstr ] , and moreover , completely stable to perturbation . in particular , it suffices to know that such a current can be constructed on schwarzschild giving the required positivity properties in this frequency range .",
    "thus , the outline of the boundedness argument appears quite simple : apply @xmath60 and @xmath108 to @xmath224 as in the boundedness proof , and apply @xmath60 , @xmath108 , and @xmath151 to @xmath225 as in the decay proof to obtain integrated decay ( and thus in particular energy boundedness ! ) for @xmath225 .",
    "this would in particular yield the non - degenerate energy boundedness statement for @xmath228 .",
    "the pointwise estimates would then follow by commutation , in view also of section  [ red ] .    to implement the above argument , however , is tricky : in order to decompose @xmath4 as in @xmath229 one would in particular have to take the fourier transform of @xmath4 in time . yet",
    "a priori we have not shown that @xmath4 is even uniformly bounded . thus we must replace @xmath4 with a cut - off version @xmath230 , where @xmath231 is a cutoff function in time , and apply the decomposition to @xmath232 . generating error terms which must themselves be bounded .",
    "it is essential that one has at ones disposal a non - degenerate energy , as in the statement of theorem , to bound these error terms .",
    "this is accomplished via a bootstrap argument .",
    "see  @xcite for the details of the proof .",
    "the above argument for boundedness is relatively simple and robust because it circumvents the problem of understanding trapping : it sufficed to know that @xmath225 is not trapped . if one is to tackle the problem of decay , however , one has no choice but to come to terms with the structure of trapping in detail .",
    "since the codimensionality of the trapping must be viewed in phase space , this suggests adapting our arguments , particularly the construction of @xmath151 , to phase space",
    ". we shall be able to accomplish this , but at the expense of restricting to kerr spacetimes , as opposed to the general class of section  [ ubound ] .",
    "there is a convenient way of doing phase space analysis in kerr spacetimes , namely , as discovered by carter  @xcite , the wave equation can be separated .",
    "walker and penrose  @xcite later showed that both the complete integrability of geodesic flow and the separability of the wave equation have their fundamental origin in the presence of a _ killing tensor_. in fact , as we shall see , in view of its intimate relation with the integrability of geodesic flow ,",
    "carter s separation of @xmath233 immediately captures the codimensionality of the trapped set .",
    "the separation of the wave equation requires taking the fourier transform with respect to time , and then expanding into oblate spheroidal harmonics . as before , taking the fourier transform requires cutting off in time .",
    "since this has essentially already been addressed in the previous section , let us pretend that this is not an issue , and that we may write @xmath234 where @xmath235 are the oblate spheroidal harmonics with eigenvalues @xmath236 .",
    "the wave equation @xmath16 then reduces to the following equation for @xmath237 : @xmath238    defining a coordinate @xmath154 by @xmath239 , where @xmath240 , and setting @xmath241 , then @xmath242 satisfies @xmath243 where @xmath244 consider the following quantity @xmath245 then , with the notation @xmath246 , @xmath247    the main difficulty is for @xmath99 supported in @xmath248 , @xmath249 , where we may choose @xmath250 ( but not @xmath251 ) large .",
    "an easy computation shows that for suitable choice of @xmath250 , in this frequency range @xmath252 has a unique simple zero .",
    "let us denote the @xmath136-value of this zero by @xmath253 .",
    "we now choose @xmath254 so that ( i ) @xmath255 , ( ii ) @xmath256 for @xmath257 and @xmath258 for @xmath259 , and ( iii ) @xmath260 .    integrating the identity and using that @xmath261 as @xmath262 we obtain that for any compact set @xmath263 in @xmath154 and a certain compact set @xmath264 ( which in particular does not contain @xmath148 ) , there exists a positive constant @xmath265 so that @xmath266 where @xmath267 denotes the @xmath136-value of @xmath106 . reinstating the dropped indices @xmath268 , suming over @xmath126 , @xmath206 , integrating over @xmath214 , and adding this estimate to an estimate for the remaining frequencies ( which in fact need not degenerate near @xmath148 ) , and finally adding a little bit of the estimate corresponding to @xmath108 ( recall that the computation @xmath200 is stable ! ) , we obtain the analogue of @xmath182 for @xmath4 ( with @xmath86 replacing @xmath269 ) .    this yields integrated decay for solutions to @xmath16 on kerr @xmath270 with small @xmath17 .",
    "once one has the integrated decay estimates , the other aspects of the proof of decay on schwarzschild are stable to perturbation of the metric , modulo a loss in @xmath271 in the @xmath130 power of the rate of decay , where @xmath271 depends on the closeness to schwarzschild .",
    "this requires , however , a refinement of the use of @xmath108 , in view of the fact that the vector field @xmath183 as defined in @xmath272 fails to be @xmath273 on @xmath106 .",
    "a further issue arises in that one must commute with the schwarzschild @xmath96 to obtain the desired pointwise decay statements , and these are no longer killing , generating errors .",
    "see  @xcite for details .",
    "@xcite [ dt ] let @xmath274 be kerr for @xmath213 , @xmath6 be the closure of its domain of dependence , let @xmath63 be the surface @xmath275 , let @xmath12 , @xmath13 be initial data on @xmath63 such that @xmath276 , @xmath277 for @xmath278 , and @xmath88 , and let @xmath4 be the corresponding unique solution of @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath279 denote the @xmath280-parameter family of diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath60 , let @xmath281 be a spacelike hypersurface in @xmath282 terminating on null infinity , and define @xmath283 .",
    "let @xmath284 and assume @xmath285 then there exists a @xmath286 depending on @xmath14 ( with @xmath287 as @xmath288 ) and a @xmath104 depending only on @xmath281 such that @xmath289 now let @xmath290 and assume @xmath291 where @xmath96 are the angular momentum operators corresponding to the related schwarzschild metric @xmath292 on @xmath6 . then @xmath293",
    "one can obtain decay for arbitrary derivatives , including transversal derivatives to @xmath106 , using additional commutation by @xmath108 .",
    "the above theorem was first announced at the clay summer school in zrich in july 2008 and its proof appears in the lecture notes  @xcite .",
    "there is some additional interesting work in progress related to this section which should be noted : tohaneanu et al .",
    "are pursuing a related approach to the integrated decay statement of section  [ separ ] , again relying on the red - shift estimates developed in  @xcite ( presented here in section  [ red ] ) , but where the frequency localisation is carried out with the machinery of the pseudodifferential calculus . andersson and blue",
    "are pursuing an alternative approach to the construction of section  [ separ ] , in terms of higher order currents , similar to the current @xmath294 of section  [ xconstr ] , but where commutation with @xmath96 is repalced by commutation with the so - called carter operator .",
    "the theorem of section  [ statthe ] does not close the book on this subject",
    ". it would be nice to obtain this result with the least possible assumptions on the geometry .",
    "for instance , what can be said about decay under the much more general assumptions of our boundedness result , the theorem of section  [ ubound ] ?",
    "it would be interesting also to obtain stronger decay rates in the interior . in the kerr case ,",
    "it is important to obtain results for the whole range @xmath295 . : _ if @xmath296 is not supported in a neighborhood of @xmath22 and @xmath62 , then for @xmath297 , @xmath298 . _ as in the heuristics of price , this statement is of course compatible with  @xmath299 for the sum over @xmath126 .",
    "] moreover , it is essential to understand boundedness and decay properties for higher spin ( see below ) .",
    "another interesting direction is to study spacetimes with cosmological constant ( see  @xcite ) . for an extensive list of related open problems ,",
    "see  @xcite .    the most important future direction , however , and the main motivation for the problem considered in this talk is the stability of the kerr family of spacetimes as solutions to the cauchy problem for the einstein vacuum equations @xmath300 see  @xcite for a formulation .",
    "this latter problem is one of the main open problems in general relativity .",
    "the role of linear theory for the understanding of the non - linear stability problem can be seen from the proof of the nonlinear stability of minkowski space , first given in christodoulou ",
    "klainerman  @xcite .",
    "the proof of  @xcite required in particular a robust method of proving the results of sections  [ ubound ] and  [ decker ] , not just for the wave equation @xmath16 , but for the spin-@xmath301 bianchi system satisfied by the curvature tensor , and not just on a background which was exactly minkowski , but for spacetimes sufficiently close to and decaying to minkowski .",
