    "recent advances in laser cooling , atom optics , and bose - einstein condensation have underlined the role played by atomic recoil in atom - field interactions .",
    "a measure of the importance of recoil effects is the recoil frequency , @xmath4 associated with the absorption , emission or scattering of radiation of wavelength @xmath5 by an atom of mass @xmath6 once this quantity becomes greater than or comparable to decay rates or doppler widths that characterize the spectral response of atoms , recoil can lead to new features in absorption or emission line shapes .",
    "one class of such phenomena has been termed _ recoil - induced resonances _ ( rir ) [ 1 - 8 ] , which occur when a weak probe and strong pump field _ simultaneously _ drive a given atomic transition .",
    "interesting in their own right , the rir have been used to determine the velocity distribution of laser - cooled atoms @xcite , as a probe of bose - einstein condensates @xcite@xcite , and in a feedback mechanism in stochastic cooling @xcite . related to the rir is the so - called _ collective atomic recoil laser _",

    "both the rir and carl represent new diagnostic probes of cold - atom sysytems .",
    "recently , moore and meystre @xcite proposed that carl be used to entangle optical and matter fields , as well as to entangle different modes of the condensate excited by the optical fields .",
    "our discussion is limited to situations in which the collective effects associated with carl can be neglected . in this paper",
    ", we combine rir with _ ground state spectroscopy _ @xcite to obtain qualitatively new features in the probe absorption spectrum .",
    "the scheme we adopt is based on the model developed in @xcite involving raman transitions , but for which all effects associated with atomic recoil were ignored . in that work",
    "a new type of interference was discovered , allowing one to selectively turn on and off certain lines in the absorption - emission spectrum by controlling the ratio of the rabi frequencies of the two fields that comprise the two - photon pump field .",
    "interference in a dressed state basis occurs between pathways involving the probe field and each of the two pump fields .",
    "since the two pump fields impart different recoil momenta to the atoms , it is not at all obvious that the interference persists when recoil splittings are resolved .",
    "part of the motivation for our calculation is to examine this question .",
    "in addition , we show that the interference persists even if the pump fields are in quantized , fock states .",
    "the probe absorption spectrum consists of as many as eight absorption - emission doublets which are fully resolvable if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some effective ground state lifetime .",
    "this is in contrast to the rir spectrum on dipole allowed optical transitions @xcite , where at most one absorption emission doublet is resolvable if @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an _ excited _ state decay rate .",
    "one might question the need to increase the number of recoil doublets in the probe spectrum , since a single doublet can be used to probe recoil effects .",
    "we show that the additional recoil structure reflects interesting quantum dynamics of the combined atom - field system , as well as providing some new applications .    in sect .",
    "ii , a model is developed for the interaction of the atoms with the pump fields ; dressed states of the atom plus pump fields are defined . in sect .",
