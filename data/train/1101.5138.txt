    "[ fig : tau_mass ] , we present the measurements and average values of @xmath4 .",

    "we account for correlations due to common dependence of normalization on the @xmath5pair cross - section  @xcite and assumed branching fractions for the background modes .",

    "we use 131 measurements from non - b - factory experiments , which includes the set used in the global fit performed by the pdg  @xcite .",
    "the measurements from non - b - factories include 37 measurements from aleph , 2 measurements from argus , 1 measurement from cello , 36 measurements from cleo , 6 measurements from cleo3 , 14 measurements from delphi , 2 measurements from hrs , 11 measurements from l3 , 19 measurements from opal , and 3 measurements from tpc .",
    "finally , we include the following measurements from the b - factories ( babar and belle ) :    * 12 measurements from babar : @xmath6 * and 10 measurements from belle : @xmath7    all of these 153 measurements are expressed as a linear function of the form @xmath8 of `` base '' branching fractions @xmath9 , which are chosen such that they sum up to unity .",
    "the results of the fit are shown in table  [ tab : tauglobalfit ] , which has @xmath10 ( cl = 4.9% ) .",
    "the differences between the global fit performed by pdg and us are :    * we expand the list of base modes from 31 to 37 to account for recent measurements by the b - factories with significant precision .",
    "* we use the original correlation matrix published by aleph  @xcite between hadronic modes instead of between pionic modes .",
    "* we use updated background estimates to adjust the b - factory measurements . *",
    "we avoid applying the pdg - style scale factors to all our measurements",
