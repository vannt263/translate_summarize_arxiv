    "the concept of a side information  vending machine ( vm ) was introduced in @xcite for a point - to - point model , in order to account for source coding scenarios in which acquiring the side information at the receiver entails some cost and thus should be done efficiently . in this class of models ,",
    "the quality of the side information @xmath0 can be controlled at the decoder by selecting an action @xmath1 that affects the effective channel between the source @xmath2 and the side information @xmath0 through a conditional distribution @xmath3 .",
    "each action @xmath1 is associated with a cost , and the problem is that of characterizing the available trade - offs between rate , distortion and action cost .    extending the point - to - point set - up ,",
    "cascade models provide baseline scenarios in which to study fundamental aspects of communication in multi - hop networks , which are central to the operation of , e.g. , sensor or computer networks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "standard information - theoretic models for cascade scenarios assume the availability of given side information sequences at the nodes ( see e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) . in this paper , instead , we account for the cost of acquiring the side information by introducing side information vms at an intermediate node and/ or at the final destination of a cascade model . as an example of the applications of interest ,",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] , where the intermediate and end nodes can obtain side information from remote data bases , but only at the cost of investing system resources such as time or bandwidth .",
    "another example is a sensor network in which acquiring measurements entails an energy cost .",
    "as shown in @xcite for a point - to - point system , the optimal operation of a vm at the decoder requires taking actions that are guided by the message received from the encoder .",
    "this implies the exchange of an explicit control signal embedded in the message communicated to the decoder that instructs the latter on how to operate the vm .",
    "generalizing to the cascade models under study , a key issue _ _ to be tackled in this work is the design of communication strategies that strike the right balance between control signaling and source compression across the two hops .",
    "as mentioned , the original paper @xcite considered a point - to - point system with a single encoder and a single decoder .",
    "various works have extended the results in @xcite to multi - terminal models .",
    "specifically , @xcite considered a set - up analogous to the heegard - berger problem @xcite , in which the side information may or may not be available at the decoder .",
    "the more general case in which both decoders have access to the same vending machine , and either the side information produced by the vending machine at the two decoders satisfy a degradedness condition , or lossless source reconstructions are required at the decoders is solved in @xcite . in @xcite , a distributed source coding setting that extends @xcite to the case of a decoder with a side information vm",
    "is investigated , along with a cascade source coding model to be discussed below . finally , in @xcite , a related problem is considered in which the sequence to be compressed is dependent on the actions taken by a separate encoder .    the problem of characterizing the rate - distortion region for cascade source coding models , even with conventional side information sequences ( i.e. , without vms as in fig .",

    "this is referred to as the cr constraint following @xcite , and is of relevance in applications in which the data being sent is of sensitive nature and unknown distortions in the receivers reconstructions are not acceptable ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "this characterization extends the result of @xcite mentioned above to the set - up with a side information vm , and also in that both rates @xmath8 and @xmath4 are allowed to be non - zero ; * _ adaptive actions _ :",
    "finally , we revisit the results above by allowing the decoders to select their actions in an adaptive way , based not only on the received messages but also on the previous samples of the side information extending @xcite .",

    "we have extended this result to the multi - terminal framework and we conclude that , in all of the considered examples , where applicable , adaptive +    + selection of the actions does not improve the achievable rate - distortion - cost trade - offs .",
    "our results extends to multi - hop scenarios the conclusion in @xcite that a joint representation of data and control messages enables an efficient use of the available communication links .",
    "in particular , layered coding strategies prove to be optimal for all the considered models , in which , the base layer fulfills two objectives : determining the actions of downstream nodes and simultaneously providing a coarse description of the source .",
