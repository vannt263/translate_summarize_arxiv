    "[ fig : regimes ] provides a qualitative summary of our results .",
    "while our simulations are in two dimensions , we expect the scaling relations we have identified to hold for @xmath171 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all scaling exponents near jamming that have been measured in both 2d and 3d are the same .",
    "there is also numerical evidence that @xmath43 is the transition s upper critical dimension @xcite .",
    "our work provides a bridge between linear elasticity near jamming , viscoelasticity at finite strain rate , and nonlinearity at finite strain amplitude .",
    "the measured relaxation modulus @xmath55 is in good agreement with the linear viscoelasticity predicted by tighe @xcite .",
    "consistent with the granular experiments of coulais et al .",
    ", we identify a crossover to nonlinear strain softening . their crossover scales differently with the distance to jamming , possibly due to the presence of static friction .",
    "the emulsions of knowlton et al .  also soften @xcite .",
    "they display a crossover strain that is roughly linear in @xmath172 , consistent with both our @xmath6 and the results of otsuki and hayakawa @xcite , who simulated large amplitude oscillatory shear at finite frequency .",
    "the agreement between the crossover strains in our quasistatic simulations and the oscillatory shear simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite is surprising , as most of their results are for frequencies higher than @xmath15 , where viscous stresses dominate .",
    "there are also qualitative differences between the quasistatic shear modulus , which can not be collapsed to a master curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : softening ] ) , and the storage modulus in oscillatory shear , which can @xcite .",
    "we speculate that there are corresponding microstructural differences between packings in steady state and transient shear @xcite , similar to those which produce memory effects @xcite .",
    "soft sphere packings near jamming approach the isostatic state , which also governs the rigidity of closely related materials such as biopolymer and fiber networks @xcite .",
    "it is therefore remarkable to note that , whereas sphere packings soften under strain , quasistatically sheared amorphous networks are strain stiffening beyond a crossover strain that scales as @xmath154 @xcite , which vanishes more slowly than @xmath152 in packings .",
    "hence nonlinearity sets in later and with opposite effect in networks @xcite .",
    "we expect that this difference is attributable to contact changes , which are absent or controlled by slow binding / unbinding processes in networks .",
    "we have demonstrated that the onset of softening occurs when the system has accumulated a finite number of contact changes correlated with the system s initial distance from the isostatic state .",
    "this establishes an important link between microscopic and bulk response .",
    "yet further work investigating the relationship between microscopic irreversibility , softening , and yielding is needed .",
    "the inter - cycle diffusivity in oscillatory shear , for example , jumps at yielding @xcite , but its pressure dependence has not been studied .",
    "shear reversal tests could also provide insight into the connection between jamming and plasticity .",
    "while the onset of softening can be probed with quasistatic simulation methods , rate dependent effects such as the strain scale @xmath5 should be sensitive to the manner in which energy is dissipated .",
    "the dissipative contact forces considered here are most appropriate as a model for foams and emulsions .",

    "<S> the shear response of soft solids can be modeled with linear elasticity , provided the forcing is slow and weak . both of these approximations must break down when the material loses rigidity , such as in foams and emulsions at their ( un)jamming point  suggesting that the window of linear elastic response near jamming is exceedingly narrow . </S>",

    "<S> their findings caused the authors to question , if not the formal validity , then at least the usefulness of linear elasticity in jammed solids  not just at the jamming point , but anywhere in the jammed phase .    subsequently , van deen et al .  </S>",

    "<S> recent experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite provide evidence for a two stage yielding process , where packings first soften and only later establish steady shear flow . </S>",

    "<S> it is necessary to vary strain , strain rate , pressure , and system size simultaneously and systematically  as we do here for the first time . using simulations of viscous soft spheres </S>",
    "<S> , we find that hooke s law is valid within a surprisingly narrow window bounded by viscous effects at small strain and nonlinear softening at large strain . </S>",
