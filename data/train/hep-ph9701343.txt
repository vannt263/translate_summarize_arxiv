    "low energy supersymmetry provides the most successful solution to the naturalness problems which plague the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this has led to an extensive study of the experimental consequences of low energy supersymmetry in the literature and the next generation of colliders will explore a substantial fraction of the supersymmetric parameter space . if superstring theory is assumed to be the underlying fundamental theory at the planck scale , then not only is it responsible for low energy supersymmetry , but the possibility exists that the sm gauge group may be larger at the tev scale .",
    "this is because a consistent string theory requires large gauge groups ( e@xmath5e@xmath6 or so(32 ) ) .",
    "depending on the particular compactification scenario , the resulting low energy n=1 supersymmetric theory often has a gauge group with rank larger than four .",
    "the simplest possible extension of the sm gauge group suggested by a gauge group of larger rank involves the introduction of one extra u(1 ) factor .",
    "this produces an extra neutral gauge boson , @xmath7 , in the particle spectrum .",
    "the low energy phenomenology of @xmath7 bosons has been extensively discussed in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , particularly strong motivation for having the mass of the @xmath1 below a tev has been emphasized by cvetic and langacker @xcite .",
    "however , most analyses of @xmath1 physics do not discuss supersymmetric contributions in detail .",
    "in this work we will examine the supersymmetric decay channels of the @xmath7 boson , including decays to neutralinos , charginos and supersymmetric higgs bosons which are normally neglected .",
    "our analysis will also include d - term corrections to the scalar masses which can have appreciable effects and are also not normally included models was reported by e. ma @xcite .",
    "the possibility of large mass shifts from the effect of @xmath1 d - terms on sfermion masses has also been emphasized by j.lykken @xcite . ]",
    "the supersymmetric particle spectrum will be calculated by choosing typical values for soft masses and parameters which are consistent with recent suggestive evidence @xcite for supersymmetry , such as the @xmath2 event at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "we prefer to focus on this region of parameters rather than survey the entire parameter space .",
    "this will lead to representative values of the @xmath1 branching fractions in the presence of low energy supersymmetry .",
    "if a @xmath7 exists then our analysis will provide a more realistic context in which to experimentally search for these particles .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we begin in sec .",
    "ii by systematically writing down all the supersymmetric lagrangian terms relevant for @xmath1 boson decay in effective rank 5 models . using these terms",
    "we will derive the decay widths including the phase space factors .",
    "a parametrisation of d - term contributions to the supersymmetric scalar masses in effective rank 5 models is also briefly discussed and we comment on possible radiative u(1)@xmath8 symmetry breaking scenarios . in sec .",
    "iii we present a generic set of branching fractions for various @xmath1 models . using these values",
    "we show that the @xmath1 mass bounds from direct limits at fermilab are lower than those normally quoted .",
    "final comments and the conclusion will be presented in sec .",
    "an appendix also follows which summarises the mass contributions for sfermions and higgs bosons .",
    "the low energy theory resulting from the breakdown of extended gauge groups can include additional gauge bosons in the spectrum .",
    "since the grand unified gauge group e@xmath9 has rank 6 and the sm gauge group has rank 4 there can be at most 2 additional gauge bosons . for simplicity we will consider an effective rank 5 low energy theory with only one additional gauge boson associated with an extra u(1 ) and parametrised by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a mixing angle and    \\(i ) @xmath12 occurs when e@xmath13so(10)@xmath14u(1)@xmath15 ,    \\(ii ) @xmath16 occurs when so(10)@xmath17su(5)@xmath14u(1)@xmath18 .    the orthogonal combination to ( [ zpdef ] ) is assumed to occur at the intermediate or planck scale .",
    "when e@xmath9 breaks directly to a rank 5 group ( sm @xmath14 u(1)@xmath19 ) as in superstring inspired models via wilson line breaking @xcite , the extra @xmath0 boson is denoted z@xmath20 .",
    "we will also consider the model with @xmath21 which will be referred to as @xmath22 .",
    "this model occurs when @xmath23 breaks to su(6)@xmath14su(2)@xmath24 and is orthogonal to the @xmath25 model .",
    "there are two types of mixing that can occur between the sm @xmath0 boson and an extra @xmath7 boson .",
    "the first is associated with the fact that in general @xmath0 and @xmath7 are not mass eigenstates .",
    "the mass squared matrix in the interaction basis has the form @xmath26\\equiv",

    ". this matrix can be diagonalised by an orthogonal matrix which is parametrised by a mixing angle @xmath36 satisfying @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the mass eigenstates and @xmath40 recent analysis @xcite of the lep results indicate that this mixing must be small , @xmath41 , because the measured @xmath0 mass is quite close to the value predicted in the sm .",
    "since the mixing angle in the effective rank 5 model is @xmath42 where @xmath43 , the @xmath7 boson needs to be well above the electroweak scale .",
    "except for the decay mode @xmath44 this mixing will be unimportant and for the most part we will ignore mixing effects and assume that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the other type of mixing is associated with the kinetic energy terms when there are two u(1 ) factors in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this kinetic mixing will result in a shift of the u(1)@xmath47 charges and depends on the matter content of the theory .",
    "it will also not be important for the results that we will obtain .",
    "we will assume that the matter superfields reside in the fundamental @xmath48 of e@xmath9 , which consists of the left handed fields @xmath49 where @xmath50 includes the left - handed quarks @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 includes the left - handed leptons @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "in addition we also fix the @xmath1 mass to be @xmath73 gev , which sets the scale for all the kinematically allowed decays .",
    "thus , in table [ brtable ] when the branching fraction @xmath74 it is because the squark and slepton masses are too heavy to be kinematically allowed .",
    "similarly only the sufficiently light higgs bosons , neutralinos and charginos are included .",
    "all exotic particles such as the vectorlike quarks are also assumed to be very heavy .    in fig .",
    "[ massesfig ] we show the squark and slepton masses including the d - term contributions .",
    "= 5.0 in    the general effect of the d - term contributions is to make the squarks and sleptons heavy since the scale of the d - terms is set by @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ massesfig ] there are special values of the mixing parameter @xmath11 where the d - term contributions cancel and the squark and slepton masses become light .",
    "these are the only points that could be consistent with squarks and sleptons that would have appeared already at fermilab @xcite .",
    "such sensitivities are very encouraging from the point of view of extracting information about new physics from limited data . beyond these values",
    "the squared masses become negative and this signals the onset of charge and colour breaking minima",
    ". it may be possible that radiative corrections can stabilise the vacuum but the analysis of these corrections is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "when the @xmath1 mixing parameter @xmath11 approaches @xmath77 the squark and slepton masses become unacceptably large .",
    "this is because the d - term contribution to the scalar masses from @xmath76 ( eq . ( [ dtheta ] ) )",
    "is @xmath78 and when @xmath79 we have @xmath80 .",
    "thus , in effective rank 5 models with a u(1)@xmath8 symmetry breaking potential of the form ( [ higgspot ] ) one can exclude @xmath81-like models ( or regions near @xmath82 ) because the squark and slepton masses become large and negative leading to charge and colour breaking minima ( where we have neglected radiative corrections ) .",
    "as far as determining a lower @xmath1 mass bound from collider experiments , the main consequence of accurately including all supersymmetric decay channels is that the branching fraction into leptons and quarks is reduced .",
    "this lowers the @xmath1 mass bound from that normally quoted in the literature .",
    "the @xmath83 branching fraction from table  [ brtable ] is in the range @xmath84 , where typically in non - supersymmetric models one obtains @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "if we use the direct limit from a recent combined analysis of cdf and d0 data @xmath86 @xcite , then for the branching fractions listed in table [ brtable ] we obtain @xmath87 gev for @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "the importance of various decay channels can be determined from how the branching fractions in table [ brtable ] vary as a function of the @xmath1 mixing parameter @xmath11 .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig .",
    "[ brfig ] for @xmath90 and @xmath91 gev .",
    "= 6.0 in    we have excluded the regions corresponding to negative squark and slepton masses which are near @xmath92 . as the soft mass parameter @xmath71 becomes larger the charge and colour breaking regions shrink .",
    "near the excluded regions ( which correspond to @xmath89 and @xmath22 for @xmath90 gev ) the @xmath1 branching fractions to squark and sleptons are maximised because their masses become light enough to be kinematically allowed . as @xmath93 the d - term corrections make the squarks and sleptons kinematically inaccessible . a significant neutralino and chargino branching fraction occurs in models which are @xmath94-like ( or @xmath95 ) .",
    "specifically , decays to the lightest neutralino can be as large as @xmath96 and this would contribute greatly to the @xmath1 invisible width . as @xmath97 the branching fraction to neutralino and chargino pairs gets smaller",
    "while the neutrino branching fraction becomes larger .",
    "decays to higgs bosons become non - negligible for @xmath98 .",
    "one should also note that the branching fraction to leptons and quarks remains fairly constant .",
    "in particular the branching fraction to light quarks ( u , c , d , s , b ) is at most 0.45 .",
    "thus for light quarks @xmath99pb where we have assumed @xmath100 gev .",
    "this is too small to be observable in the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "note that the branching fraction to up quarks vanishes for @xmath22-type models .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the up - quark @xmath1 coupling becomes zero .",
    "it is also amusing to note that both cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite report events with dielectron invariant mass @xmath101 gev and cdf also has a second event with invariant mass @xmath102 gev .",
    "if one assumes that these high energy events are due to the decay of a @xmath1 boson , then given our range of b(@xmath103 ) , this would correspond to a @xmath1 mass @xmath104 gev .",
    "one would also expect these events to be backward , i.e. @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the angle of the outgoing @xmath107 with respect to the quark in the @xmath108 centre of mass frame @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ afbfig ] we plot the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath109 as a function of the mixing angle @xmath11 .",
    "= 6.0 in    a very large asymmetry is expected for @xmath22 type models .",
    "it is tantalising that the two events reported by cdf with invariant masses of 350 gev and 504 gev have @xmath110 values of -0.14 and -0.27 respectively @xcite .",
    "if we require that the probability of observing two backward events be at least @xmath111 then one would need @xmath112 .",
    "we have examined in detail the supersymmetric contributions to the decay of an extra @xmath0 boson in effective rank 5 models parametrised by the angle @xmath11 , including the important effect of d - terms on sfermion masses .",
    "the supersymmetric particle spectrum was chosen so as to be consistent with other analyses such as the recent @xmath2 event and the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "the main effect of including these contributions is that it reduces the @xmath1 branching fraction into lepton pairs .",
    "this , in turn reduces the lower bound on the @xmath1 mass obtained from direct limits at the tevatron .",
    "while the @xmath1 decay to neutralino and chargino pairs is always non - negligible , this is not necessarily the case for squarks and sleptons .",
    "when the squarks and sleptons are dominated by positive d - term contributions their masses can become very large and consequently they are no longer a kinematically accessible @xmath1 decay mode .",
    "however for special ranges in parameter space the d - term contributions become negative and give rise to light squark and slepton masses . at these values",
    "the branching fraction of squarks and sleptons is non - negligible .",
    "as @xmath11 approaches @xmath77 various squark and slepton masses squared become negative leading to charge and colour breaking minima .",
    "thus depending on the size of soft squark and slepton mass parameters , effective rank 5 models with regions of @xmath11 near @xmath77 produce unacceptably large d - term contributions .",
    "if one also assumes a u(1)@xmath8 symmetry breaking potential ( [ higgspot ] ) then it is possible to achieve a radiative breaking mechanism without any fine - tuning of the soft parameters .",
    "finally , the forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath4 pairs becomes quite large at the @xmath22 model and the two reported cdf events are consistent with models of this type .",
