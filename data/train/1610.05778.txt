    "<S> the theoretical understanding has seen substantial progress by the fascinating concepts of eigenstate thermalization @xcite and typicality of pure quantum states @xcite as well as by the invention of powerful numerical methods such as density - matrix renormalization group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much less is known on the route to equilibrium as such @xcite and still the derivation of the conventional laws of ( exponential ) relaxation and ( diffusive ) transport on the basis of truly microscopic principles is a challenge to theory @xcite .    in strictly isolated systems </S>",
    "<S> any coupling to heat baths or particle reservoirs and any driving by external forces is absent . in such systems , the only possibility to induce a non - equilibrium process is the preparation of a proper initial state . </S>",
    "<S> while different ways of preparation can be chosen , a sudden quench of the hamiltonian is a common preparation scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , once a specific state is selected , a crucial question is : to what extent is this state a non - equilibrium state ? to answer this question , it is natural to measure the observable one is interested in . </S>",
    "<S> if the expectation value is far from equilibrium , the state should be also . </S>",
    "<S> if this value is close to equilibrium , the state should be correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , only in the latter case , the resulting dynamics of the expectation value and linear response theory are expected to agree with each other . while this line of reasoning is certainly intuitive , it neglects internal degrees of freedom of the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the measurement of a single observable can not detect if the underlying state is pure or mixed , entangled or non - entangled , etc . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , an intriguing question is : do such internal details play any role for the dynamics of an expectation value ?    in this letter , we investigate exactly this question for the anisotropic spin-@xmath0 heisenberg chain . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , signatures of diffusion at high temperatures have been found only in the regime of large anisotropies @xmath53 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath52 is merely a necessary and no sufficient criterion for diffusion since , by definition , the variance yields no information beyond the width of the distribution @xmath54 . </S>",

    "<S> next , we turn to our numerical results , starting with a typical initial state @xmath19 , i.e. , the case of random @xmath23 . for a single realization of this state , </S>",
    "<S> we summarize in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] the resulting expectation value @xmath29 in a 2d time - space density plot for different anisotropies @xmath63 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and a large system with @xmath69 sites . </S>",
    "<S> several comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> first , for all values of @xmath7 shown , the initial @xmath1 peak monotonously broadens as a function of time and the non - equilibrium density profiles have the irreversible tendency to equilibrate . </S>",
    "<S> such equilibration is non - trivial in view of our isolated and integrable model . </S>",
    "<S> second , for times below the maximum @xmath70 depicted , the spatial extension of the density profiles is still smaller than the length of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> thus , unwanted boundary effects do not emerge for such times . </S>",
    "<S> third , the broadening of the density profiles is faster for smaller values of @xmath7 because the scattering due to particle interactions decreases as @xmath7 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for the small @xmath39 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( c ) , the width of the density profile clearly increases linearly as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> this linear increase is the expected ballistic dynamics arising from partial conservation of the spin current . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the larger @xmath37 and @xmath67 in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the width of the density profiles does not increase linearly and is rather reminiscent of a square - root behavior . </S>",
    "<S> however , such a conclusion is not possible on the basis of a density plot .     but now for the anisotropy @xmath71 . in ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian fits can not describe the tails of the density profiles accurately . in ( b ) the standard deviation of these fits ( open symbols ) and according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ variance ] ) ( closed symbols ) still agrees with linear response ; however , the time dependence is clearly inconsistent with diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> note that finite - size effects are negligibly small @xcite . ]    to gain insight into the dynamics at @xmath37 , we depict in fig.[fig2 ] ( a ) the site dependence of the expectation values @xmath29 at fixed times @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> conveniently , we subtract the equilibrium value @xmath72 and use a semi - log plot to visualize also the tails of the density profiles . as illustrated by fits , the site dependence can be described by gaussians @xmath73\\ ] ] and , remarkably , over several orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> such a pronounced gaussian form of the density profiles is a second main result of our letter and has , to best of our knowledge , not been reported in the literature yet . </S>",
    "<S> this result unveils that the standard deviation @xmath74 is not just a width but also the only parameter required to describe the full site dependence . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the gaussian form is one of the clearest signatures of diffusion so far . </S>",
    "<S> still , diffusion requires that @xmath74 scales as @xmath75 .    to further judge on diffusion , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( b ) the standard deviation @xmath74 , as resulting from the gaussian fits in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we further depict linear - response results for @xmath65 in eq.([derivative ] ) and the underlying @xmath64 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ d ] ) , as calculated in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath76 . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the excellent agreement shows the very high accuracy of the typicality relation in eq.([typicality ] ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this agreement demonstrates that the known linear - response result @xmath77 , resulting from @xmath78 at such @xmath16 @xcite , also holds for our non - equilibrium density dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> hence , together with the gaussian form , we can conclude that diffusion exists .    </S>",
    "<S> an analogous analysis for the isotropic point @xmath71 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( a ) shows that simple gaussians are not able to describe the tails of the density profiles accurately . this is why the standard deviation @xmath74 of corresponding fits slightly deviates from the linear - response result in fig.[fig3 ] ( b ) . but </S>",
    "<S> these deviations disappear if @xmath65 is calculated exactly according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ variance ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> most notably , however , the time dependence of @xmath65 is inconsistent with diffusion , as can be seen easiest from the non - constant @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath65 points to superdiffusion @xcite .     for another and _ untypical _ initial state @xmath35 in the xxz spin-1/2 chain with @xmath36 sites and different anisotropies : @xmath37 , ( b ) @xmath71 , ( c ) @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> compared to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the dynamics is frozen in ( a ) , similar to @xcite , and features pronounced jets in ( c ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> now , we turn to the untypical initial state @xmath79 , i.e. , the case of equal @xmath23 . recall that for this state we obtain the same initial density profile but the relations in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ typicality ] ) and ( [ derivative ] ) do not need to hold . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we summarize the resulting expectation values @xmath29 in a 2d time - space density plot again . compared to fig.[fig1 ] , the broadening turns out to be clearly different . the dynamics is frozen for @xmath37 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( a ) and features pronounced jets for @xmath39 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we do not find obvious indications of equilibration , at least for all times considered . </S>",
    "<S> these observations constitute a third main result of our letter . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that the lack of internal randomness in the initial condition is essential for the observation of non - equilibrium dynamics beyond linear response theory .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us briefly mention another property of the untypical initial state @xmath79 , which could be responsible for the special dynamics found . </S>",
    "<S> this property is the lack of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is easy to see that @xmath35 can be written as the product state @xmath80 with a spin - up state @xmath81 in the middle of the chain and a spin - up / spin - down superposition @xmath82 at all other sites . by definition , such a product state </S>",
    "<S> is not entangled at all . in clear contrast </S>",
    "<S> , the typical initial state can not be written as a product state .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> _ in this letter , we have investigated the real - time broadening of non - equilibrium density profiles in the spin-@xmath0 xxz chain . </S>",
    "<S> first , we have introduced a class of pure initial states with identical density profiles where a maximum @xmath1 peak is located in the middle of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> then , we have shown for a subclass with internal randomness that the resulting non - equilibrium dynamics can be connected to equilibrium correlation functions via the concept of typicality . </S>",
