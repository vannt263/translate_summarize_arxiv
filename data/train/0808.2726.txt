    "relaxation properties of systems with a great number of metastable states have attracted much attention in the recent decades.@xcite these systems are usually characterized by the existence of _ both _ disorder and frustration .",
    "a well - known system is the ising spin glass model,@xcite which displays non - exponential relaxation at low temperatures.@xcite interesting aging phenomena@xcite were also observed in this system.@xcite the coulomb glass model , which is another interesting disordered system , has recently been shown to exhibit relaxation of the stretched exponential form.@xcite such non - exponential relaxation was also reported in frustrated systems without disorder and its relation with the percolation transition was discussed.@xcite    in a superconducting array , frustration can be induced in a controllable way by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "it has crucial effects on thermodynamics of the system and results in a variety of equilibrium properties.@xcite such remarkable diversity in the equilibrium properties naturally leads to expectations that a variety of interesting dynamic behaviors is also present , particularly in relaxation toward equilibrium .",
    "an interesting limiting situation arises in the presence of irrational frustration , the most typical case of which is provided by the frustration parameter @xmath2 with the golden number @xmath3 .",
    "the system was first suggested to exhibit a spin - glass - like phase at low temperatures due to self - generated disorder.@xcite subsequently , it was argued to display novel finite - size effects@xcite that the size - dependent transition temperature decreases monotonically with the system size , resulting in the absence of a finite - temperature transition.@xcite simulation results for the current - voltage characteristics supported the zero - temperature transition,@xcite while experimental results were interpreted to exhibit finite - temperature transitions.@xcite recent monte carlo simulations , investigating the vortex configuration at low temperatures in the system with @xmath4 given by rational approximants to @xmath5 , indicate the existence of a low - temperature phase where the helicity modulus takes a finite value along one direction and vanishes along the other down to very low temperatures.@xcite from dynamical perspectives , due to the existence of many metastable states that are almost degenerate with one another ( which is attributable to the incommensurate magnetic field ) , one may expect characteristic slow relaxation in the array with irrational frustration .",
    "dynamic simulations of this system , based on simple langevin dynamics , indeed disclosed a crossover temperature below which strongly nonexponential relaxation emerges , exhibiting some analogy to the behavior of supercooled liquids.@xcite    in this paper we investigate the relaxation behavior of the superconducting array with irrational frustration in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations , employing the resistively - shunted - junction ( rsj ) dynamics in the overdamped limit ( i.e. , junction capcitances are neglected ) .",
    "note that the present rsj dynamics can , in principle , be realized in real junction array experiments ; this is in contrast to the langevin dynamics employed in existing simulations , which assumes hypothetic dissipation between the superconducting islands and the ground .    at equilibrium",
    ", we observe that chirality autocorrelations are characterized by stretched exponential relaxation ( with a temperature - dependent stretching exponent ) in a wide range of intermediate and low temperatures .",
    "the relaxation time exhibits non - arrhenius behavior with the vogel - tammann - fulcher type of temperature dependence .    on the other hand ,",
    "beginning with random initial states quenched to low temperatures ( @xmath6 ) , the dynamics exhibits slow aging behavior , not reaching the equilibrium relaxation within our computing time .",
    "it is observed that , for a short time ( approximately up to time @xmath7 to @xmath8 depending on the waiting time and temperature ) , relaxation of the chirality autocorrelation function exhibits the von schweidler behavior.@xcite after the short time , chirality autocorrelations for short waiting times relax according to the so - called ogielski form with temperature - dependent exponents . for longer waiting times , this behavior slowly changes into the stretched exponential form with a temperature - dependent stretching exponent .",
    "the ogielski form of the nonequilibrium relaxation is characterized by power - law behavior in the intermediate time scale and faster decay in the long - time region .",
    "the emergence of power - law behavior in the intermediate time scale suggests the presence of a sort of coarsening dynamics with dynamic scaling , which is supported by the evolution of vortex patterns .",
    "this is also consistent with the vortex configurations in low - energy states obtained from a global optimization algorithm such as conformational space annealing ( csa).@xcite those vortex configurations obtained from csa exhibit interesting features : there exist approximately parallel domains of local vortex order corresponding to the staircase ground state of @xmath1.@xcite those domains are separated by domain - wall regions , consisting of characteristic local arrangements of four consecutive vacancies along one ( horizontal or vertical ) direction , thereby neighboring domains are parallel - shifted by two horizontal ( or vertical ) lattice units .",
    "reminiscent of the smectic order in a liquid crystal , such configurations may be described as smectic ( liquid - crystalline ) arrangements of diagonal chains of vortices .",
    "similar features of the vortex lattice were also reported for the case of frustration @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which are rational approximants to the irrational value @xmath11.@xcite    evolution of the vortex pattern in general exhibits growth of local vortex order with time toward the low - temperature anisotropic state described above .",
    "this power - law behavior of coarsening is expected to be interrupted by long - time fluctuations of domain walls , limiting the maximum local domain size to around @xmath12 lattice units on average . in the long - time limit ,",
    "vortex motions occur predominantly in the domain - wall region through transfer of vortices between neighboring diagonal vortex chains , which correspond also to the motion of four consecutive vacancies .",
    "accordingly , the higher mobility of the vortices located in domain - wall regions can naturally explain dynamic heterogeneity in the system , leading also to the stretched exponential relaxation .    as for the resistive transition",
    ", one can argue that , as long as the domain - wall defects keep fluctuating with unbounded displacement , the system would remain resistive ( i.e. , exhibiting finite resistance ) even at low temperatures below the transition to the anisotropic phase , since there always exists a direction along which the helicity modulus vanishes .",
    "those domain - wall defects are likely to freeze at a much lower temperature which vanishes in the limit of irrational frustration ; thus concluded is a zero - temperature resistive transition in the system with irrational frustration .",
    "note , however , that this argument applies to a pure system with no quenched disorder . in a real josephson - junction array ,",
    "disorder is inevitable in the distribution of critical currents of individual junctions , which leads to pinning of domain - wall defects at finite temperatures .",
    "this may explain the recent experimental results reporting a finite - temperature resistive transition near incommensurability of the magnetic frustration.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the equations of motion for the rsj dynamics of the system in the fluctuating twist boundary conditions .",
    "section iii presents the results of simulations performed on the equations of motion .",
    "both equilibrium and nonequilibrium relaxation behaviors of chirality autocorrelations are examined and coarsening , interrupted by fluctuating domain - wall defects , is addressed .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",

    "we have considered mostly systems of linear size @xmath49 and @xmath50 , taking averages typically over @xmath51 to @xmath52 ensembles with random initial states .",
    "the size has been chosen as members of the fibonacci sequence , thus to minimize the boundary effects due to the irrational frustration @xmath53 .",
    "for comparison , we have also considered close rational approximants @xmath54 and @xmath55 , to find no qualitative difference in relaxation dynamics .",

    "these results are consistent with those from langevin dynamics.@xcite as the temperature is further lowered , especially below @xmath68 , the system , starting from a random initial state , does not relax to the equilibrium within the available computing time . instead of pursuing equilibrium relaxation at these low temperatures",
    ", we probe nonequilibrium relaxation for various waiting times by letting the system evolve from random initial states .",
    "it is found that the resulting relaxation of chirality autocorrelations proceeds in three stages .",

    "[ fig : relax_short_tw0](c ) we show @xmath73 versus time @xmath74 at temperature @xmath77 for various waiting times .",
    "it is observed that the von schweidler behavior with @xmath76 is rather robust , hardly depending on the waiting time or the target temperature .",
    "this is in contrast with the results of langevin simulations , where the value of @xmath78 tends to deviate from @xmath79 , getting smaller at low temperatures.@xcite we presume that this discrepancy arises from the difference in vortex dynamics ( and diffusion ) at short times between rsj dynamics and simple langevin dynamics .",

    "emergence of the power - law behavior of the nonequilibrium relaxation at intermediate times strongly suggests that there exist some coarsening processes in the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : conf_growth_t013 ] exhibits snapshots of the vortex configuration at temperature @xmath94 , taken at several time instants ; one can recognize slow growth of local order corresponding to @xmath1 vortex patterns , with diagonal chain structures . since the frustration of the system is given by @xmath53 , which is slightly smaller than @xmath95 , these locally ordered domains of @xmath1 patterns may not grow to span the whole system . instead , there should exist finite length ( and also time ) scales for the growth of these local domains , beyond which the growth is interrupted by domain - wall regions of lower vortex density , so that the net vortex density of the whole system becomes equal to @xmath5 .    in order to understand the vortex configuration attained in the long - time limit at low temperatures , we investigate the configuration of low - energy states by means of the efficient optimization algorithm , csa.@xcite snapshots of typical vortex configurations obtained via csa are shown in fig  [ fig : conf_csa_l55 ] , where we observe domains of locally ordered vortex patterns corresponding to the staircase ground state of the system with frustration ( or vortex density ) @xmath1 .",
    "these domains of typical width @xmath96 to @xmath12 lattice spacings are separated by domain - wall ( line defect ) regions that consist of characteristic local arrangements of four neighboring vacancies ( see bar - shaped regions , each with four consecutive empty plaquettes ) ; there the vortex density is lower than the locally ordered regions ( of local vortex density @xmath95 ) in such a way that the net vortex density of the whole system is precisely equal to @xmath5 ( which is less than @xmath95 ) .",
    "this configurations may also be described as a liquid - crystal - type arrangement of diagonal chains of vortices ( of length @xmath96 to @xmath12 ) , with the neighboring chains of vortices shifted in the diagonal direction by about half the length of the chains .",
    "similar configurations were observed in the case of rational approximants to @xmath5.@xcite in the long - time limit , we expect that the coarsening dynamics will lead eventually to the locally ordered configuration with domain walls , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conf_csa_l55 ] . within a locally ordered domain ,",
    "vortices are almost rigid and resist moving .",
    "in contrast , those vortices at ends of the chains are easily put in motion , jumping into the bar - shaped vacancies in domain - wall regions and thus joining another vortex chain .",
    "this in turn gives rise to domain - wall fluctuations ( or equivalently , fluctuations in the length of the vortex chains ) , which would lead slowly but ultimately to the complete restructuring of the local vortex configuration .",
    "it is thus expected that dynamic heterogeneity naturally emerges from the existence of distinctly mobile vortices in the domain - wall regions.@xcite    we believe that such domain - wall fluctuations and restructuring of the local vortex configuration can explain the absence of freezing of the relaxation at low temperatures .",
    "namely , the low - temperature state is presumably of a liquid crystalline type : even though there exists orientational order in the chain - like arrangement of vortices , those diagonal chains can _ flow _ ( like a liquid ) due to the transfer of vortices between neighboring chains , corresponding to the fluctuating motion of the bar - shaped vacancies and resulting in finite resistivity . at a much lower temperature",
    "one may expect complete freezing of the domain walls to occur . the freezing temperature should depend on the commensurability of the distribution of the vacancy defects and the underlying background vortex lattice ;",
    "this is directly related to the rationality of @xmath97 ( with @xmath98 and @xmath99 relatively prime integers ) and the freezing temperature is expected to vanish in the irrational limit ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "it is of some interest to note the similarity to the behavior found in the lattice coulomb gas with charge density near the golden number.@xcite even though the detailed ordering pattern is different , it was found numerically that there exist two - step transitions in the lattice coulomb gas with @xmath101 , where the intermediate phase corresponds to anisotropic striped charge ordering together with mobile charges within partially - filled channels .",
    "there the lower transition corresponds to the complete freezing of charges within partially filled diagonal channels , which occurs at temperatures sensitively dependent on the rationality of @xmath4 due to the commensurability effects . in this",
    "study our system is the josephson - junction array in the limit of irrational frustration , and we thus expect that the true vortex freezing would occur at zero temperature .",
    "as long as the domain - wall defects fluctuate with unbounded displacement , the system should remain resistive , exhibiting finite resistance .",
    "these domain - wall defects are expected to freeze at much lower temperature of the order @xmath102 for @xmath97 ; this leads to the zero - temperature resistive transition in the limit of irrational frustration .",
    "note that this argument applies for pure systems with no quenched disorder . in the case of real josephson - junction arrays ,",
    "some type of disorder , e.g. , in the distribution of the critical currents of individual junctions is unavoidable .",
    "therefore pinning of the domain - wall defects can easily occur at finite temperatures , having resistance vanish .",
    "this may explain the recent experiment reporting a finite - temperature resistive transition near incommensurability of the magnetic frustration , where disorder in the critical currents of individual junctions was noted to be up to @xmath103.@xcite",
    "we have studied the relaxation behavior of the chirality autocorrelation function in two - dimensional superconducting arrays under irrational frustration at intermediate and low temperatures .",
    "both equilibrium relaxation and nonequilibrium relaxation have been investigated via numerical simulations of rsj dynamics .",
    "equilibrium relaxation dynamics reveals characteristic features of the stretched exponential form with the vogel - tamman - fulcher dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "nonequilibrium relaxation at low temperatures , beginning with random initial states exhibits interesting waiting - time dependence : for short waiting times , the relaxation follows a power - law behavior in the intermediate - time regime and faster decay in the long - time regime , characterized together by the ogielski form with temperature dependent exponents . for longer waiting times , this gradually crosses over to a stretched exponential form .",
    "further , in all cases of short and long waiting times , the relaxation at early time stage fits nicely to the von schweidler form with exponent about @xmath79 .",
    "it has been argued that the power - law behavior originates from coarsening dynamics up to a certain length scale , with the local vortex order corresponding to the ground state of @xmath1 , found to be consistent with the vortex configurations of low - energy states .",
    "this coarsening , however , is interrupted by the presence of domain - wall defects .",
