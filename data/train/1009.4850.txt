    "su(3 ) color produces the right superconducting phase , while adding the sextet sector provides the infra - red scaling interactions and asymptotic freedom saturation needed for the critical behavior .",
    "srikingly , the sextet sector could also solve what are currently regarded as the two most fundamental problems of particle physics .",
    "sextet `` pions '' provide an effective higgs sector that produces electroweak symmetry breaking , while stable sextet `` neutrons '' provide dark matter .",
    "anomaly color factors imply that the sextet sector , including dark matter and multiple electroweak bosons , will dominate high - energy cross - sections and so could be responsible for the dominance of dark matter production in the early universe .",
    "these cross - sections could also be responsible for the cosmic ray spectrum knee .",
    "if so , they should be seen at the lhc .",
    "most extraordinarily , though , consistently adding the electroweak interaction to qcd@xmath5 requires a unique massless su(5 ) theory that might provide an unexpected and novel origin for the standard model .",
    "i will suggest that the standard model may actually be reproducing an anomaly - driven bound - state s - matrix that contains both the critical pomeron and massive neutrinos and which sits within the su(5 ) theory .",
    "small neutrino masses could be direct evidence for the , _ perforce very small , _",
    "su(5 ) coupling .",

    "qud @xmath6 su(5 ) gauge theory with left - handed couplings @xmath7 to @xmath8 massless fermions *    contains a potential electroweak symmetry - breaking color sextet doublet , is anomaly free , and is asymptotically free . under @xmath9",
    "it was a welcome surprise that , in addition to the sextet quarks \\ { ... } having the right quantum numbers for sextet `` pions '' to provide the longitudinal components of the electroweak vector bosons , qud also contains qcd@xmath5 .",
    "in fact , both the triplet quark and lepton sectors , neither of which were asked for , are amazingly close to the standard model .",
    "there are``almost '' three generations - denoted by superscripts * 1,2,3*.    very importantly , qud is real _ \\{vector - like } _ with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "obviously , the @xmath11 quantum numbers are not quite right for the standard model , but ( also very importantly ) the lepton anomaly is correct . only after i fully understood the reggeon anomaly dynamics of qcd@xmath5 ,",
    "did i realise that qud could be physically realistic if the same dynamics is present . in this case , _ all elementary leptons and quarks would be confined and remain massless , with infra - red anomalies dominating the dynamics ! !",
    "_ the standard model would have to be an effective theory obtained ( in principle ) by integrating out the elementary leptons .",
    "a priori , the bound - states of a massless field theory are prohibitively difficult to access .",
    "fortunately , multi - regge theory provides a key !",
    "as is well - known , infinite momentum wee partons can , in principle , play a vacuum role .",
    "the multi - regge region involves multiple infinite - momenta that , specifically for qcd@xmath5 and qud , allow `` universal wee partons '' to play this role in the reggeon diagram construction of bound - state amplitudes .",
    "crucially , the infinite - momenta also introduce anomaly pole bound - states .",
    "because of it s uniqueness , qud is either right or wrong , in it s entirety .",
    "if it fails to reproduce the standard model s - matrix , it is necessarily wrong .",
    "although much further development is obviously needed and very many details are missing , the arguments outlined in the following imply that    _ _    * all elementary fermions are confined . *",
    "infinite - momentum bound - states contain anomaly poles involving zero - momentum chirality transitions that produce *  su(5 ) @xmath12 su(3)@xmath0u(1)@xmath13  * symmetry breaking .",

    "the s - matrix is a * massless fermion anomaly phenomenon , * without corresponding off - shell amplitudes .",
    "although qud lies in the su(5 ) `` conformal window '' and the symmetry is unbroken at large @xmath14    * the s - matrix has only standard model interactions *    * and a spectrum of standard model form .",
    "*    * there is no higgs  ! ! * all particles , including ( majorana ) neutrinos , are bound - states with dynamical masses    consequently , qud could , perhaps , provide an amazingly economic underlying unification for the standard model , while also producing neutrino masses . beyond the known generations and the sextet quark sector that , potentially , solves the other outstanding mysteries of dark matter and electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", there is only a lepton - like octet quark sector and a pair of exotically charged quarks .",
    "my construction implies that the octet quark sector is buried in all states in an infinite - momentum ( light - cone ) subtraction role that produces leptons and hadrons in standard model generations .",
    "although the physics is both novel and radical , it is consistent with all established standard model physics and explains many puzzles .",
    "unfortunately , the multi - regge theory that i use to uncover it is so erudite that general interest may well require , what would surely be@xcite ,    _ * a major experimental discovery , * i.e. the lhc observes big x - sections for multiple z s and w s , @xmath15 and @xmath16 pairs and , distinctively , @xmath17 _ together with _ @xmath18 _ pairs._@xmath19 _    an immediate major issue is whether , and how , physical scales can be produced by qud .",
    "unfortunately , i do not yet have the calculational tools to address this issue directly .",
    "an infra - red fixed - point implies a very small coupling , with the second - order @xmath20-function giving @xmath21  @xmath2 .",
    "while this has the great attraction that it might be an immediate explanation for small neutrino masses , it also implies that standard model couplings can not be obtained via qud evolution .",
    "it is essential , therefore , that all particles are anomaly - produced bound - states without the off - shell amplitudes needed to invoke evolution . in this case , @xmath22 has no direct physical meaning , moreover , the elementary interaction strengths are enhanced , in the high - energy s - matrix , by infinite sums of wee gauge bosons involving anomaly color factors .",
    "indeed , the larger color factors for sextet states imply that , at high - energy , this new sector will be produced with cross - sections that are even larger than normal hadronic cross - sections .",
    "cosmic rays already suggest that new large x - section physics including dark matter could appear at the lhc ! as shown in figure 1 ,    = 3.4 in    the spectrum knee occurs between tevatron and lhc energies .",
    "it is remarkably well - established , yet not understood . although dark matter was unknown , a major threshold for neutral particles , unobserved in detectors ,",
    "was initially suggested ( @xmath23 40 years ago ) .",
    "underestimation of the energy would pile - up events as a `` knee '' .",
    "unbelievably , perhaps , neutral particles must also dominate the x - section far above the knee .",
    "but , if the dark matter x - section is large at the highest lhc energy , a link to the knee is surely inevitable .",

    "_ sextet neutrons as incoming cosmic rays ( including uhe ? ) with a threshold for atmospheric interaction not far below the knee . _    but , can sextet x - sections be large enough to dominate the total x - section at the highest energies ?",
    "if so , a natural explanation for the existence and dominance of stable dark matter in the universe would be provided .",
    "multiple regge poles appear in multi - regge limits of multiparticle amplitudes .",
    "most familiar , perhaps , is the triple - regge limit , illustrated in figure 2(a ) , in which @xmath25 along distinct light - cones . in the @xmath26 rest - frame ,",
    "the regge pole pions have @xmath27-momentum and continuation to @xmath28 gives the on - shell pion coupling to the pomeron .    more important , for our purposes , is the `` di - triple regge '' ( dtr ) limit in which two triple - regge limits are separated by a further @xmath27-momentum .",
    "now , as illustrated in figure 2(b ) , regge - pole pions can scatter via the pomeron .",
    "all the pions and the pomeron have @xmath27-momentum in some frame , suggesting that both bound - states ( @xmath29 ) and interactions ( @xmath30 ) could appear as reggeon states in which `` universal wee partons '' play a vacuum role .",
    "if this can be shown , it amounts to a derivation of ( much more than ) the parton model .    in my construction of dtr amplitudes an initial , cut - off induced , @xmath14 infra - red divergence produces universal wee gluon reggeons in both qcd@xmath5 and qud , as illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the wee gluon reggeons have opposite sign color and space parities and so are `` anomalous '' .",
    "= 4.9 in    they couple via anomaly vertices that are chirality violating and contain _ infra - red chirality transitions _ of massless quarks .",
    "such vertices , _ necessarily _ , involve more than one dtr reggeon channel",
    ". moreover , in combined @xmath27-momentum and small @xmath14 limits , they reduce to * anomaly poles * that provide both * bound - state particles * and the * vertex factorization * of the wee gluons . after outlining the origin of reggeon anomaly vertices",
    ", i will discuss qcd@xmath5 briefly and then discuss qud in more detail .    that standard model states and interactions emerge in qud ( in my construction ) as the complexity of the wee partons increases ,",
    "is what has to be demonstrated .",
    "the wide range of scales and interactions in the standard model has to be a consequence of the build - up of the ( infinite ) variety of wee parton anomaly vertices that couple the interactions in the distinct dtr channels .",
    "the arguments that follow will uncover , at best , only the simplest components of what is surely a truly complicated , if beautifully elaborate , phenomenon .",
    "reggeon diagrams are generated when large light - cone momenta are routed through feynman diagrams so that internal particles are maximally close to mass - shell , while also having large relative rapidities .",
    "internal particles with finite relative rapidity generate reggeon interaction vertices and , in a gauge theory , fermion loop reggeon vertices include triangle anomalies . because a four - dimensional interaction is involved , the anomalies occur only in special vertices coupling reggeon channels with distinct light - cone momenta ( such as appear in the dtr limit ) .",
    "included are axial - vector / vector / vector triangle diagrams @xmath31 that , in both qud and massless qcd@xmath5 , must be defined as the zero fermion mass limit of massive reggeon diagrams .    at first sight",
    ", chirality is conserved in zero mass triangle diagrams , implying @xmath32 - producing a conflict between the axial - vector anomaly and vector current conservation . however , the regularization of @xmath33 amplitudes is a major problem .",
    "fortunately , for our purposes , it can be shown that vector current conservation plus the axial anomaly implies unique massless infra - red anomaly pole chiral amplitudes .    in infra - red limits ,",
    "pseudoscalar anomaly poles appear similiarly in chirality - violating and non chirality - violating amplitudes via the triangle singularity .",
    "when there is a chirality transition , as illustrated in figure 4 , the pseudoscalar pole can be a chiral goldstone boson .",
    "infinite - momentum chirality transitions can also occur as part of a pauli - villars subtraction .",
    "the structure of dtr amplitudes in massless qcd@xmath5 is summarized , in a first approximation , in figure 5 .",
    "= 5.5 in    anomalous wee gluon reggeons appear in both the pions and the pomeron via anomaly vertices involving zero - momentum quark chirality transitions ( and , for the pion , a longitudinal gluon exchange allowed by the gribov ambiguity ) .",
    "as illustrated , the full pion coupling to the pomeron also contains a perturbative coupling of the dynamical quark and gluon reggeons that are involved .",
    "the wee gluons lie in an su(2 ) color subgroup , but their combination with the dynamical reggeons produces a color zero projection in each channel .",
    "this results in su(3 ) color zero states when the su(2 ) subgroup is randomized ( averaged over ) within su(3 ) , as we briefly discuss later , via the critical pomeron .",

    "the critical pomeron occurs as a factorized regge pole , plus triple pomeron interactions - consistent with the parton model .",
    "if sextet pions become the longitudinal components of massive electroweak bosons , sextet nucleons are the only new states .",
    "( the @xmath34 aquires an electroweak scale mass by mixing with the pomeron . ) that sextet quarks have zero current mass implies the @xmath15 neutron is stable . ( electric charge makes the @xmath16 proton heavier - in contrast to the triplet sector . )",
    "the very strong , very short range , qcd self - interaction implies the @xmath15 s could form dark matter `` clumps '' .",
    "they will only interact with normal matter at ultra high energies .",
    "@xmath15 production will dominate the high - energy cross - sections responsible for early universe stable matter formation , and will also explain the cosmic ray knee !    these results are at variance with conventional expections for high - energy qcd",
    ". there are fewer states ( than requiring just confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ) and the interaction is simpler . both features are strongly suggested by experiment ! although the anomaly dynamics appears to require the quarks to be massless , effective quark masses that do not disturb the dynamics are produced by embedding qcd@xmath5 in qud .",
    "the chirality transitions in qcd@xmath5 do not conflict with the vector gauge symmetry . in qud ,",
    "more fundamentally , they produce a dynamical breaking of the non - vector part of the gauge symmetry . in the following construction",
    "they are a direct consequence of the zero fermion mass limit and so they retain the initial mass symmetry breaking . in the physical s - matrix , they should be dynamical and randomized via the critical pomeron .",
    "i start with masses for all reggeons and a @xmath14 cut - off @xmath35 . how the masses and cut - off are removed is crucial in resolving the ( light - cone ) gribov ambiguity and , in effect , produces the wee partons of the massless theory . a combination of * 24 * and * 5@xmath365@xmath37 * scalar vev s is needed to give masses to all the fermions .",

    "the path from high - energy unitarity to the critical pomeron , then to qcd@xmath5 via the supercritical pomeron , and finally to qud , is outlined ( with references ) .",
    "the underlying influence of gribov s work is emphasized .",
    "the following two papers provide background perspective and further comments on the general significance of qud , as well as additional references .",
    "there is also more discussion of the physics that should be seen at the lhc .",
    "central to the arguments of this paper are reggeon diagram effective vertices that contain the fermion triangle diagram anomaly .",
    "the triangle diagrams involved originate from much larger loop feynman diagrams in which many internal lines are placed on - shell by the multi - regge limit in which the vertices appear . because of their special spin and momentum structure , such vertices are an essential component of our construction of bound - state amplitudes in both qcd@xmath5 and qud . in this appendix",
    "we elaborate the intricate interplay of ultra - violet and infra - red phenomena that we anticipate by describing a variety of properties of the elementary triangle diagram involving axial - vector , vector , and chiral currents .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the origin and significance of anomaly poles , as both an infra - red and an ultra - violet phenomenon , including an elaboration of the chirality transitions involved .",
    "reggeon diagram effective vertices actually contain couplings with much more structure than the local couplings of the diagrams we study here .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the infra - red structure involving on - shell particles to be the same , even though the large momentum region will be more complicated .",
    "therefore , in the paper we assume that infra - red anomaly poles appear in the same way as in the elementary amplitudes and that the interplay with ultra - violet phenomena is essentially the same .",
    "we begin our discussion by considering the amplitude @xmath92 involving one axial - vector and two vector currents , defined as @xmath93 where @xmath94 [ ( p - k_1 + k_2)^2 -m^2 ]   [ ( p - k_1)^2 -m^2 ] } } \\auto\\label{tamp}\\ ] ] and the second term results from reversing the direction of the fermion line - thus producing bose symmetry for the two vector currents .",
    "we will also discuss the amplitude @xmath95 involving three ( identical ) axial - vector currents that would be formally defined by the same integral as @xmath96 if ( as is not the case ) @xmath33 s could be straightforwardly anti - commuted through the trace numerator .",
    "we will discuss this issue at some length later , it is very important for our general purpose .",
    "it is very well known that ( [ tamp ] ) is linearly divergent and that a subtraction procedure is necessary to properly define both the @xmath96 and @xmath95 amplitudes .",
    "the subtraction can be carried out by a pauli - villars procedure utilising an unphysical fermion whose mass is taken to infinity at the end of calculations .",
    "this procedure directly preserves conservation of the vector currents and , in addition , has other important consequences .",
    "as we will illustrate , the subtraction process can also be viewed as involving surface terms that generate both the anomaly and vector current conservation . in this case",
    ", the routing of external momenta through the diagram becomes a non - trivial issue and , as is also well - known , it is the momentum routing illustrated in fig .",
    "a.1(a ) that gives vector current conservation .",
    "the alternative momentum routing illustrated in fig .",
    "a.1(b ) will also play a role . in our discussion of @xmath95",
    "we will use the symmetric momentum notation illustrated in fig .",
    "a.1(c ) , although the definition we use will effectively be a symmetrized sum of amplitudes defined via the momentum routing of fig .",
    "a.1(a ) .",
    "if dimensional regularization is used , it is the ambiguity of defining @xmath33 away from four dimensions , rather than the ambiguity of external momentum routes , that becomes the problem in defining @xmath96 , @xmath95 , and related chiral amplitudes . the definition of massless fermion chiral amplitudes will be an essential part of our discussion of the physical significance of anomaly poles and , for this purpose",
    ", it will be very important that we start with the fermion mass @xmath97 and that , in effect , we use pauli - villars regularization .",
    "indeed , as we emphasize in the main body of this paper , all of the `` massless '' qud diagrams that we consider are defined via zero mass limit(s ) of massive diagrams .",
    "@xmath96 can be decomposed into invariant amplitudes by writing @xmath98 the bose symmetry implies that @xmath99 the ward identities corresponding to conservation of the vector currents are @xmath100 which will be satisfied , respectively , if @xmath101 and @xmath102    in our reggeon diagram analysis , we are particularly interested in the `` ward identity zeroes '' that follow from ( [ vwi ] ) . in general",
    ", if a vector current amplitude @xmath103 satisfies a ward identity @xmath104 the amplitude necessarily vanishes at @xmath105 . to see this",

    "when the surface contribution to ( [ tamp ] ) is chosen to ensure that the vector ward identities ( [ vwi ] ) are satisfied the result ( as we discuss next ) is a constant term in @xmath109 and @xmath110 , giving @xmath111 for momenta where the other @xmath112 are non - singular , only @xmath109 and @xmath110 can contribute an axial current divergence .",
    "the two terms ( [ uvco ] ) produce the familiar `` anomaly '' divergence , or anomalous ward identity , @xmath113    the vector ward identities ( [ vwi ] ) are separately satisfied by a single term of the form @xmath114 which also , potentially , contributes to the axial current divergence . indeed , if we introduce an `` anomaly pole '' into @xmath115 we can obtain a single term @xmath116 which directly reproduces the anomaly divergence while , simultaneously , satisfying the vector ward identities .",
    "this will become increasingly significant in the following .    a priori",
    ", it might seem that the general term ( [ exa ] ) could be added to ( [ inde ] ) .",
    "however , because of the identity @xmath117_{\\mu } ~=~ & - ( { \\hbox{\\large $ \\epsilon$}}_{\\delta \\sigma\\alpha\\mu}k_{1\\beta }   -{\\hbox{\\large $ \\epsilon$}}_{\\delta \\sigma\\beta\\mu}k_{2\\alpha }    -{\\hbox{\\large $ \\epsilon$}}_{\\delta \\sigma\\beta\\mu}k_{1\\alpha }   + { \\hbox{\\large $ \\epsilon$}}_{\\delta \\sigma\\beta\\mu }   k_{2\\beta } ) k_1^{\\delta}k_2^{\\sigma}\\cr   & ~+~{\\hbox{\\large $ \\epsilon$}}_{\\sigma\\alpha\\beta\\mu}k_2^{\\sigma}~   ( k_1\\cdot k_2 - k_1 ^ 2 ) ~-~{\\hbox{\\large $ \\epsilon$}}_{\\sigma\\alpha\\beta\\mu}k_1^{\\sigma}~   ( k_1\\cdot k_2 -k_2 ^",

    "we will appeal to this identity at several points in our discussion .",
    "to aid our discussion , we briefly describe how the large momentum surface contribution to ( [ tamp ] ) depends on the routing of external momenta through the diagram and how this can be fixed by requiring the vector ward identities be satisfied .",
    "( [ uvco ] ) can be derived from ( [ tamp ] ) as follows .",
    "a shift of the integration variable @xmath118 by @xmath119 produces a surface contribution ( that is independent of @xmath120 ) @xmath121 if we then write @xmath122 we obtain @xmath123 adding the contribution from @xmath124 gives ( [ uvco ] ) , with the remaining part of the amplitude defined via the ( more natural ) momentum routing shown in fig.5.2(b ) .",
    "a further role is played by surface terms in using ( [ sti1 ] ) to obtain the vector ward identities . evaluating @xmath125 with the momentum routing of fig .",
    "5.2(b ) and using @xmath126 we obtain @xmath127 when @xmath128 is added the result is a sum of two terms , each of which gives a surface contribution .",
    "the first contribution is @xmath129 which , since the two integrands differ by an integration shift of @xmath130 , gives @xmath131~\\biggl ( tr\\{\\gamma_5 \\gamma_{\\mu } \\gamma_{\\rho}\\gamma_{\\beta}\\gamma_{\\tau}\\ } ~(-k_1)^{\\tau } + tr\\{\\gamma_5 \\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma_{\\tau}\\gamma_{\\beta}\\gamma_{\\rho}\\ } ( k_2)^{\\tau}\\biggr ) \\cr & = ~\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2 } \\epsilon_{\\mu\\beta\\delta\\sigma}~k_1^{\\delta}k_2 ^{\\sigma } } \\auto\\label{st}\\ ] ] combining this with the second surface contribution and adding the contributions from terms of the form of ( [ sti1 ] ) to the full integral , we obtain the first ward identity of ( [ vwi ] ) .",
    "the bose symmetry is essential for the appearance of surface integrals .",
    "note also that , in effect , the kinematic form of the surface contribution to ( [ tamp0 ] ) is obtained by simply keeping the external momentum contributions to propagator numerators , i.e. @xmath132    if pauli - villars regularization is used then the integral defined by subtracting an unphysical finite mass fermion loop is convergent and so has no surface term contributions .",
    "therefore , all integration variable shifts go through straightforwardly and both ( [ sti ] ) and ( [ st ] ) are zero .",
    "consequently , both the axial and vector current are conserved .",
    "the anomaly appears ( in the axial current divergence ) as a remnant when the infinite mass limit is taken for the unphysical fermion .",
    "as we will discuss further , a contribution of the form ( [ st ] ) , which cancels the anomaly in the vector current divergence , can also be produced by the unphysical fermion loop .",
    "there is a close relationship between the ultra - violet anomaly contribution ( [ uvco ] ) that appears in @xmath109 and @xmath110 and an `` anomaly pole '' that appears in @xmath133 and @xmath134 and plays an essential role in the satisfaction of the vector ward identities . that such a pole might be present",
    "can be seen immediately by noting that if @xmath135 and @xmath136 is not singular at this point , then the ward identity ( [ vwi1 ] ) reduces to the very simple form @xmath137 inserting the contribution obtained from ( [ uvco ] ) then gives @xmath138 suggesting , at first sight , that there should be a pole at @xmath139 , independently of the value of @xmath140 !",
    "the second ward identity suggests ( only a little less straightforwardly ) that the same pole should also be present in @xmath133 .",
    "if we set both @xmath135 and @xmath141 , the situation is even simpler .",
    "the ward identities ( [ vwi1 ] ) and ( [ vwi2 ] ) now reduce to @xmath142 inserting , again , the contributions from ( [ uvco ] ) gives @xmath143 suggesting even more strongly that , in this special kinematic situation , there should be a pole at @xmath144 ( for arbitrary @xmath140 ! )    in fact , we will find that the pole ( [ vwi6 ] ) , and the pole ( [ vwi4 ] ) , cancel in physical amplitudes in almost all kinematic configurations and are never present when @xmath145 . although we will show that , when @xmath135 , a singularity at @xmath139 does have a very real physical significance .",
    "our results will be consistent with the results of @xcite , where it is shown that if dispersion relation representations for all the invariant functions are inserted into the ward identities , the vector identities are satisfied only if the pole ( [ vwi6 ] ) is indeed present at @xmath144 when @xmath146 , but only when @xmath147 .",
    "for our purposes , however , a much larger issue is whether there are circumstances in which this pole can be interpreted as a goldstone boson particle associated with the spontaneous breaking of a chiral symmetry generated by an axial - vector current .",
    "note that we can equally well carry through the above arguments if @xmath148 , provided that @xmath149 .",
    "we then obtain the asymptotic result @xmath150 the two terms in ( [ inde0 ] ) are sufficient , in themselves , to both satisfy the vector ward identities and give the anomaly in the axial divergence .",
    "the `` anomaly pole '' term reproduces the surface contribution to the vector ward identity that we obtained above .",
    "note that , as @xmath151 ( with @xmath152 and @xmath140 finite ) , any finite momentum region of ( [ tamp ] ) contributes behavior of the form @xmath153 and so both terms in ( [ inde0 ] ) must originate from an internal region involving large momentum components .",
    "if we assume that @xmath154 and @xmath136 contributions can consistently be neglected when @xmath155 and @xmath156 are small , as the ward identities ( [ vwi ] ) imply , ( and as is more generally the case for the reggeon vertices discussed in the text ) , then ( [ epid ] ) can be used to simplify ( [ inde0 ] ) to the simple form ( [ exa1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath157 this expression is particularly suggestive for our purposes because it has the appropriate factorization property for the pole to be interpreted as a particle pole in the @xmath158 channel . at this point",
    ", however , it is an asymptotic result for large @xmath158 that clearly does not imply the presence of a pole at @xmath144 .",
    "indeed , it would surely appear paradoxical if an infra - red particle pole , at @xmath144 , is generated in the infinite momentum part of the integral - independently of the existence of massless particles in the amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , we might expect some complication from the fact that we are subtracting the contribution of infinitely massive particles .",
    "in fact , as we will see in the next sub - section that there is a direct connection between a large ( light - cone ) momentum generated @xmath159 and an infra - red pole .",
    "the analysis of @xmath160 in @xcite is very important for our discussion , both in this subsection and later .",
    "we begin by noting that , in this analysis , it is assumed that _",
    "@xmath140 has been set to zero , _ and that the amplitude is completely symmetrized with respect to simultaneous permutations of @xmath161 and @xmath162 . in this case , if we set @xmath163 the symmetry implies that we can write @xmath95 as a sum of terms of the form ( [ exa ] ) , i.e. @xmath164 the anomaly divergence then becomes @xmath165 implying that @xmath166    therefore , in this very special kinematic situation @xmath95 can be written as a sum of three terms , each of which has the form ( [ indes ] ) and so contains an anomaly pole in one channel and has zero divergence in the other two channels .",
    "moreover this sum of anomaly pole amplitudes gives the complete amplitude .",
    "this will be very important later when we discuss chiral amplitudes even though , because of the difficulty of combining @xmath33 manipulations with the anomaly ( that we will discuss later ) there is not an immediate connection between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    that there is no sign of the particle thresholds in @xmath167 is not surprising since there is no invariant to set the scale for logarithms .",
    "indeed , without the anomaly the amplitude would have been zero .",
    "instead , it appears that the anomaly pole , that we located at large @xmath158 and small @xmath168 , in the previous sub - section , is present for all @xmath169 , when ( [ lin ] ) is satisfied , down to @xmath170 .",
    "so , is it generated at large or small momentum ?",
    "in fact , as we will see from the explicit formulae that we introduce in the next sub - section , the situation is actually quite subtle .",
    "our analysis will explain how the thresholds have disappeared and will amplify the argument in @xcite that the pole in @xmath167 is due to massless particles contributing via the triangle singularity",
    ".    at first sight , ( [ lin3 ] ) does not seem to necessitate a physical singularity in @xmath95 .",
    "rather , from ( [ lin1 ] ) , if @xmath171 and @xmath172 are all spacelike @xmath173 however , as is observed in @xcite , this is not the case if a _ finite _ light - like vector , outside of the existing momentum plane , is added to @xmath174 , say .",
    "for example , if we define basis vectors @xmath175 and write @xmath176 we obtain @xmath177 and so a physical singularity must be present .",
    "( this is closely related to our argument , in the following , that in an infinite momentum frame a goldstone boson can appear as an anomaly pole . )",
    "we will describe later how the triangle diagram internal momentum configuration that gives the anomaly pole is identified in @xcite .",
    "next , we describe some explicit formulae for the invariant functions @xmath112 appearing in @xmath96 that have been derived in the literature",
    ". these formulae will provide us with considerable insight into how an anomaly pole can appear as both a large and a small momentum phenomenon .",
    "an analytic expression for the full amplitude ( [ tamp ] ) can be found in @xcite . for our purposes",
    "we can use simpler expressions that are valid in a special kinematic configuration .",
    "motivated by our ward identity discussion of the anomaly pole , we set one vector current invariant @xmath155 to zero .",
    "this also corresponds to an anomaly vertex residue of the anomalous wee gluon divergence discussed in the paper .",
    "we use the following set of formulae , given in @xcite , that hold when @xmath178 , with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "@xmath181 where @xmath182    the simplified ward identity ( [ vwi3 ] ) is explicitly satisfied and both terms in ( [ inde0 ] ) are directly present in the appropriate invariant functions and dominate at large @xmath158 , as anticipated . at first sight , there is also a simple `` anomaly pole '' at @xmath183 , in both @xmath134 and @xmath133 , as predicted by ( [ vwi4 ] ) .",
    "however , we will show in the next subsection , by taking various limits of ( [ k2q ] ) , that in most kinematic circumstances this pole is actually canceled in the complete functions .",
    "first , it will be helpful to identify the nature of the various contributions to the @xmath112 in terms of singularity content . even without formulating an appropriate dispersion relation , we can obviously write @xmath184 where , for example , @xmath185    ~-~ { m^2 \\over k_2 ^ 2 -q^2 } [ ~\\ln^2 { \\rho + 1 \\over \\rho -1 } ] \\biggr)\\cr a^1_{k_2 ^ 2}&=~{1 \\over 4\\pi^2 } \\biggl ( { k_2 ^ 2 \\over k_2 ^ 2 -q^2 } [ ~ \\beta~ \\ln { \\beta + 1 \\over \\beta -1 } ]    ~-~ { m^2 \\over k_2 ^ 2 -q^2 } [ ~\\ln^2 { \\beta + 1 \\over \\beta -1 } ] \\biggr)\\cr a^1_{\\infty}&=~{1 \\over 4\\pi^2 } } \\auto\\label{sep1}\\ ] ] @xmath186 can be identified as the contribution of the @xmath158 threshold , @xmath187 is the contribution of the @xmath156 threshold and @xmath188 is the anomaly contribution from infinite momentum .",
    "the separation ( [ sep ] ) in each of @xmath110 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 is analagous .",
    "in @xmath133 and @xmath134 an anomaly pole is present in what appear to be infinite momentum contributions even though , as we will see , in general the double poles at @xmath183 in the threshold contributions to @xmath133 and @xmath134 combine to cancel the infinite momentum pole contributions . clearly , we would like to understand whether such a pole can actually be identified as an infinite momentum contribution .",
    "we begin with an ultra - violet limit which shows that @xmath188 can be consistently identified as originating from the infinite mass limit of an unphysical fermion loop .",
    "we consider the @xmath189 limit of @xmath190 . in this limit @xmath191 and since @xmath192 we obtain @xmath193\\cr    ~ & = { m^2 \\over 4 \\pi^2 ( k_2 ^ 2 -q^2 ) } \\biggl[\\frac{-k_2 ^ 2}{m^2 } - ~ \\frac{-q^2}{m^2 } \\biggr ] ~=~-~\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 } } \\auto\\label{lam}\\ ] ]    interpreting @xmath190 as the contribution of the unsubtracted amplitude , we see that @xmath188 acts as a pauli - villars ( opposite sign fermion loop ) subtraction which ensures that @xmath194 when @xmath195 .",
    "apparently , if we interpret @xmath196 as the contribution of the unsubtracted @xmath134 amplitude , then the anomaly pole term @xmath197 plays an identical role in @xmath198 to that played by the anomaly in @xmath199 .",
    "in particular , the pole at @xmath183 , that would otherwise be present at large @xmath140 , is canceled .",
    "we conclude that it should be possible to interpret the infinite momentum pole term as having it s origin in the pauli - villars unphysical fermion loop subtraction .",
    "this would be natural , since it is the addition of the unphysical loop that gives an amplitude which straightforwardly satisfies the vector current ward identity and results in the simple relation between @xmath109 and @xmath134 which ( at @xmath200 ) directly relates the anomaly pole to the anomaly .",
    "we will return to this discussion once we have described the connection between the anomaly pole and the triangle landau singularity .",
    "we consider next some relatively simple infra - red limits .",
    "first we consider , directly , the @xmath201 limit . again using ( [ qt0 ] ) ,",

    ", however , we see that when all momentum invariants are zero the amplitude is singular at @xmath205 , as the dimension of the amplitude implies it must be .",
    "if we take @xmath206 before taking @xmath203 , there is a logarithmic divergence and no limit is obtained . clearly , the combination of the zero mass and zero momentum limits is ambiguous and depends on the order of the limits .",
    "if we take @xmath207 directly in ( [ k2q ] ) we obtain @xmath208 the large momentum pole term survives straightforwardly , while the remainder gives a non - zero limit only because of the singularity of the threshold terms .",
    "now , it is the limit @xmath201 that gives a logarithmic divergence .",
    "if we first take the limit @xmath209 , only the pole term survives , giving the whole amplitude i.e. @xmath210 in agreement with ( [ vwi6 ] ) . since @xmath211 ,",
    "this limit is equivalent to the limit of large @xmath158 , with finite @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "consequently , the surviving pole is from the large momentum contribution .",
    "the `` infra - red '' momentum contributions containing the logarithmic thresholds have simply dropped away .",
    "note that if the @xmath158 or the @xmath156 discontinuity is taken in ( [ k1m0 ] ) , so that the logarithm aquires an imaginary part , the infra - red threshold contribution gives a double pole at @xmath212 that we will shortly identify with the triangle landau singularity .",
    "if we take the limit @xmath213 in ( [ k1m0 ] ) , we again obtain an amplitude which contains only the @xmath214 pole , i.e. @xmath215 but the residue is halved .",
    "although @xmath216 has a deeper significance that we will come to , this kinematics parallels , in part , the restriction ( [ lin ] ) that leads to the isolation of the anomaly pole in @xmath95 . the large momentum anomaly pole term is cancelled and the remaining pole term emerges from the `` infra - red '' logarithmic contribution . at this special kinematic point",
    "the logarithmic contributions of the thresholds cancel ( rather than dropping away ) , thus allowing the triangle singularity to emerge as a simple pole at @xmath144 that is , as we shall see , a direct consequence of the existence of massless fermions . presumably , ( [ lin3 ] ) results from a very similar phenomenon .",
    "the bose symmetry ( [ bsym ] ) implies an analagous contribution to ( [ k1qk0 ] ) would be obtained by taking @xmath203 followed by @xmath217 . in the symmetric limit",
    "@xmath218 the two contributions should combine to give the full anomaly .",
    "if this is the case , adding the corresponding contributions from @xmath219 and @xmath110 ( and assuming we can neglect @xmath154 and @xmath136 , as we will discuss further in * a.12 * ) , gives an infra - red result analagous to ( [ indes ] ) , i.e. @xmath220 therefore , in this symmetric infra - red region , @xmath96 will be described by one of the three terms contributing to @xmath95 in ( [ lin1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , since there is only one invariant , i.e @xmath169 , and there is no second scale to provide a scale for logarithms , it must be that ( [ indes+ ] ) describes @xmath96 for all @xmath169 , just as ( [ lin1 ] ) describes @xmath95 for all @xmath169 .",
    "if , in ( [ k2q ] ) , the @xmath221 limit is taken first , with @xmath222 , the result is @xmath223 if we now take the limit @xmath201 , we obtain @xmath224   ~\\biggr ) ~= ~o(\\frac{1}{m^2})~~\\st{\\longrightarrow}~~\\infty   \\auto\\label{k1k201}\\ ] ] and so , for @xmath225 , the anomaly pole is absent .",

    "the triangle singularity occurs when the external momenta are such that all three internal propagators in fig .",
    "a.2 are on - shell and produce poles that trap the integration contour at some point in the integration region .",
    "the equation for the singularity surface is obtained by solving the landau equations consisting of the three mass - shell conditions @xmath254 together with ( what is essentially ) a condition that the contour be trapped , i.e. @xmath255 for some set of @xmath256 .      multiplying ( [ trl ] ) by each of the @xmath258",

    "notice that the mass dependence cancels in ( [ trs1 ] ) so that , _ when @xmath135 , the triangle singularity will occur at the anomaly pole position independently of the fermion mass .",
    "_    on the physical sheet , the @xmath264 prescription implies that there is an additional `` positive @xmath265 '' condition that must also be satisfied for the contour to be trapped .",
    "this condition ( that all the @xmath265 s in ( [ trl ] ) must be positive ) is equivalent to requiring that a physical rescattering process be possible in co - ordinate space - with all internal propagators on - shell .",
    "the @xmath256 are then proportional to the flight time of the internal particles . for example , for a two - particle threshold",
    ", this condition requires that particles can not have any relative transverse momentum that would lead to them traveling apart , and so be unable to rescatter .",
    "therefore , the physical landau singularity occurs , not surprisingly , at the threshold when the two particles are produced at rest in the center of mass frame .",
    "the physical sheet triangle singularity occurs when , in the notation of fig .",
    "5.2 , an initial current carrying momentum @xmath51 produces two physical particles , one of which produces a current carrying momentum @xmath174 and continues as a physical particle before combining with the other particle to produce a current carrying momentum @xmath266 .",

    "however , since we do not have full amplitudes for the @xmath278 case , we will not discuss this kinematics any further .    in general , landau singularities occur more extensively on unphysical sheets defined by analytic continuation around the physical region branch cuts .",
    "the continuation distorts the integration contour and , as a result , a singularity can occur on the branches of the singularity surface defined by the mass - shell conditions together with a mixed set of signs for the @xmath265 s .",

    "because of the large momentum divergence producing the surface contribution involving the anomaly , this can indeed be the case .",
    "a pole generated in this way will have the property that ( when @xmath200 ) it is independant of the fermion mass and so can survive in the infinite mass limit of the subtracted pauli - villars amplitude .",
    "the circulating large light - like momentum implies , however , that the propagators necessarily carry a combination of positive and negative infinite energies .    in the various limits discussed in subsection * a.6 * , we have shown that while the triangle singularity ( anomaly pole ) at @xmath289 is present in parts of the amplitude , in all cases , there is a cancelation such that there is no singularity on the physical sheet .",
    "as we have also discussed , it appears to be possible for the anomaly pole terms in @xmath133 and @xmath134 to be viewed as a pauli villars subtraction that gives an amplitude that falls off in the infinite mass limit .    in effect , imposing vector current conservation via a pauli - villars subtraction can compensate for an incorrect i@xmath290 prescription .",
    "if we initially use a `` wrong '' i@xmath290 prescription so that an unphysical triangle singularity is present in the physical amplitude , there will be a cancelation between `` unphysical '' triangle singularities generated in the original triangle amplitude and in the subtracted unphysical pauli - villars amplitude . in both cases",
    "the mixed @xmath265 condition implies that the propagators carry a combination of positive and negative energies .",
    "we will discuss how a pole can be generated in these circumstances in sub - section * a.13*.    we have seen that the threshold branch - points are closely related to the infra - red triangle singularity .",
    "if the threshold singularities are eliminated _ as a consequence of confinement _ so that there is no infra - red anomaly pole , the large momentum anomaly pole could remain as a pauli - villars contribution to bound states .",

    "moreover , @xmath320 however , there is now a major conflict between the axial - vector and vector current ward identity divergences . obviously ,",
    "if ( [ rl2 ] ) holds , we can not simultaneously have vector current conservation and an anomalous axial current divergence .",
    "fortunately , perhaps , this conundrum is connected to the well - known difficulty in regularizing amplitudes containing @xmath33 in a manner that maintains the full @xmath52-matrix algebra .",
    "dimensional regularization ( which , at first sight , would appear to give what is wanted ) can not be used because there is no definition of an anticommuting @xmath33 away from four dimensions that also satisfies @xmath321 and so can smoothly give the four - dimensional result @xmath322 ( [ g51 ] ) is crucial in obtaining the anomaly amplitudes that we are discussing .",
    "in general , there is no way to handle the divergence of triangle amplitudes that respects the full algebraic properties of @xmath33 . in particular",
    ", @xmath33 can not be freely anticommuted around the triangle diagram , as is done to obtain ( [ rl2 ] ) .",
    "we can , however , obtain massless anomaly amplitudes that satisfy vector current conservation if we use ( [ rl ] ) directly and take the @xmath323 limit of initially massive amplitudes . because the large momentum anomaly structure is independent of the fermion mass and , moreover , contains the contribution of infinitely massive fermions , the chirality violating amplitudes , @xmath324",
    "...  , actually do not vanish but instead contain the same anomalies and anomaly pole contributions as the amplitudes that do not violate chirality .",
    "we construct a full set of anomaly amplitudes as follows .",
    "we start with well known property of the anomaly that it appears only in aaa and avv amplitudes .",
    "therefore , considering only anomaly contributions to amplitudes , we can set @xmath325 also from the foregoing , we know that both vector current conservation and the anomaly divergence are encapsulated in the anomaly pole amplitude ( [ exa1 ] ) which we have seen emerge explicitly in @xmath95 .",
    "a sum of such terms gives the full @xmath95 amplitude when @xmath326 and we have seen that , in this kinematics , a single term of this form should similarly provide the @xmath96 amplitude .",
    "therefore , in the symmetric kinematical situation @xmath326 we define @xmath327 with @xmath328 and @xmath329 defined by simultaneous rotation of @xmath330 and @xmath331 .      in this way",
    ", we obtain a set of massless anomaly pole amplitudes that gives both the correct axial anomaly divergence and vector current conservation in all channels and is also consistent with all of the foregoing .",
    "moreover , when these amplitudes are extrapolated to more general kinematic situations they must have , of course , normal physical sheet analytic properties .",
    "we assume that this requires the appearance of the same threshold structure , infra - red anomaly poles , and large momentum anomaly pole cancelations , that we have seen in @xmath96 .    clearly ,",
    "if we insist on conservation of the vector currents , chirality can not be conserved .",
    "that the chirality non - conservation appears in the triangle discontinuity , in the manner that we describe next , is of major significance in our reggeon diagram analysis .",
    "while it is , perhaps , not so surprising that the ultra - violet regularization of the anomaly that conserves vector current ward identities , necessarily violates chirality in the massless limit , it is surely a more striking phenomenon that anomaly poles appear in both the chirality violating and the non chirality violating amplitudes via the triangle singularity configuration discussed in subsection * a.9*.    we begin with a straightforward discussion of the anomaly pole in @xmath96 .",
    "the limiting momentum configuration in the triangle discontinuity is shown in fig .",
    "a.3 , along with all the @xmath52-matrices involved .",
    "the numerator trace that appears in the pole residue is evaluated by proceeding cyclically around the loop . because @xmath336 , a @xmath337 factor appears in the numerator residue as shown , while the remaining @xmath290-tensor factor , needed to produce a residue of the form of ( [ tijk ] ) , is provided via ( [ g51 ] ) .",

    "( since a convergent discontinuity is involved , and not a divergent feynman amplitude , there is no problem in anticommuting @xmath33 s . )",
    "that a residue of the form of ( [ tijk ] ) also emerges for the chirality violating amplitude @xmath338 depends much more significantly on the presence of the zero momentum line .",
    "as is evident from ( [ p30 ] ) , both the antiparticle and particle poles associated with this line contribute to the emergence of @xmath304 . as a result",
    ", it is possible for couplings to both to be present simultaneously .",
    "if this is the case then , in the residue at zero momentum , the vertices at the ends of the line can both involve particle annihilation ( or particle creation ) , as would be the result of vacuum pair production by a mass term . in effect",
    ", the zero momentum line makes a transition from a `` negative energy '' zero momentum state to a `` positive energy '' zero momentum state .",
    "the corresponding diagram is drawn as in fig .",
    "a.5 , with the vertices shown .",
    "the chirality violation along the zero momentum line is analagous to the zero momentum contribution of a propagator to a chiral condensate and so it is clearly possible that the resulting anomaly pole could be a goldstone boson associated with the breaking of a chiral symmetry . we will discuss the kinematical issues associated with this possibility shortly .",
    "a general implication of the chirality violation is , obviously , that amplitudes which would be naively expected to vanish as @xmath206 , actually need not vanish .",
    "the implications of this phenomenon will depend on the quantum numbers carried by the amplitudes involved .",

    "assuming that the pole residue results from the finite momentum propagator numerators , as in the ward identity contribution ( [ tamp0 ] ) , then the relevant contribution , together with the corresponding vertices , will again be as in fig .",
    "the appearance of the infinite momentum pole in chiral amplitudes will again be decribed by figs . a.4 and a.5 .",
    "clearly , the infinite momentum line can involve a chirality transition that parallels the zero momentum transition .    in parallel with our discussion at small momentum",
    ", the infinite momentum anomaly pole can also be viewed as an infinite light - cone momentum shift of the dirac sea , that cancels the anomaly in the vector current .",
    "considering the analogue of fig .",
    "a.5 that takes place at infinite ( internal ) momentum , the initial vertex involves the production of an off - shell , negative energy , fermion together with an on - shell state that is `` produced '' via the absorption of a negative energy state and which is then absorbed conventionally , after the helicity transition , as an on - shell positive energy state .",
    "this is equivalent to a flow , during the interaction , of the infinite momentum dirac sea .",
    "it is not immediately apparent that there are kinematical circumstances in which the anomaly pole can appear as a goldstone boson particle pole in a physical amplitude .",
    "the anomalous wee gluon infra - red divergence described in the text couples via anomaly amplitudes with @xmath200 and it is a central element of the dynamics we describe that anomaly poles emerge and produce bound - states .",
    "a subtle phenomenon is involved , as we now discuss .",
    "if we keep just the anomaly pole contributions of @xmath133 and @xmath134 to @xmath339 we obtain @xmath340 not only does this expression not have the factorization properties expected of a particle pole , it also , as we have seen , does not satisfy the vector ward identities and does not have the axial - vector anomaly .",
    "when @xmath341 we can use([epid ] ) , as we did in obtaining ( [ indes ] ) , to rewrite ( [ pipo ] ) as @xmath342_{\\mu}k_1^{\\delta } k_2^{\\sigma } } { ( k_1 + k_2)^2 } ~-~\\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\frac{({\\hbox{\\large $ \\epsilon$}}_{\\delta \\sigma\\beta\\mu}k_{1\\alpha }   -{\\hbox{\\large $ \\epsilon$}}_{\\delta \\sigma\\alpha\\mu }   k_{2\\beta } ) k_1^{\\delta } k_2^{\\sigma } } { ( k_1+k_2)^2~ } ~~~+~\\cdots   \\auto\\label{pipo1}\\ ] ] where the omitted terms are less singular as @xmath201 .",

    "if a physical goldstone boson can be isolated in reggeon amplitudes , we should be able to use the first term ( which is , of course , the same as ( [ indes ] ) and ( [ indes+ ] ) - on which we have already focussed much of our attention ) to obtain it s couplings . in this case ,",
    "@xmath344_{\\mu}$ ] provides the coupling to the axial current @xmath343 while the factor @xmath345 provides the coupling to currents @xmath346 and @xmath347 when @xmath348 .",

    "this is hardly surprising since , as a matter of principle , we would not expect to be able to determine the finite momentum coupling of a goldstone boson meson , say , to vector gluons in qcd .    also , as a matter of principle , we would expect that the anomaly pole should only emerge as a physical goldstone boson if it is generated in the infra - red integration region . as described above , to see the anomaly pole emerge as an infra - red effect when taking @xmath352 we must approach the zero momentum limit by also taking @xmath213 . if @xmath51 is timelike , then @xmath353 and so the residue , which will again be given by ( [ gbc ] ) , will vanish directly as @xmath354 , _ unless we simultaneously take an `` infinite momentum '' limit . _ to avoid this , the limit must be taken with @xmath354 .",
    "@xmath355 , such that @xmath356 remains finite , and with a spacelike component @xmath284 included such that @xmath357 .",
    "this can be done within the multi - regge limit discussed in the main text . in this case , the physical goldstone `` pions '' are built from fermion reggeons that , in an appropriate frame , carry the infinite momentum @xmath358 .",
    "the light - cone momentum ( @xmath283 ) that is taken to zero is carried by the wee partons that are playing a vacuum - like role . in this",
    "situation , physical couplings of goldstone bosons to gauge field configurations are possible , `` as a matter of principle '' . note that , to obtain the desired residue ( [ gbc ] ) , the polarizations of the wee partons ( given by @xmath346 ) and the physical fermions ( given by @xmath347 ) must be orthogonal .",
    "finally , we discuss how a cut - off affects the foregoing discussion .",
    "an essential element of our construction of reggeon diagrams and interactions , for both qcd@xmath5 and qud , is that we initially impose a transverse momentum cut - off that is also imposed in the anomaly interactions that we utilise . in previous papers ,",
    "we have discussed the importance of this cut - off at length . in principle",

    "crucially , for our purposes , because the anomaly pole is generated at finite transverse momentum , the infra - red structure will remain unchanged and so if we take the zero mass limit , together with the appropriate zero momentum limits , anomaly poles will appear in the chiral amplitudes via ( [ tia ] ) , ( [ tijka ] ) , and ( [ tijkv ] ) , as infra - red contributions ."
