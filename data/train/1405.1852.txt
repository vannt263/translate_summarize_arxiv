    "dynamical decoupling is a well - established technique to suppress the effects of an unwanted hamiltonian interaction on a quantum system , whereby the hamiltonian can describe inner - system interactions as well as interactions with an environment @xcite .",
    "the method works by asserting active control over the system : at certain times unitary operations are performed on the system and rotate it in its quantum state space such that over time the effects of the hamiltonian cancel .",
    "dynamical decoupling has been formally introduced in a general way by viola _",
    "@xcite , but the basic principle was known and used before , particularly in the nuclear magnetic resonance community @xcite , and the spin - echo effect @xcite is probably the best - known example of a simple decoupling procedure .    for an arbitrary quantum system the sequence of unitary operators needed to protect it can become fairly complex , and in general dynamical decoupling works only approximately in that it decouples the acting hamiltonian only up to the first order in the magnus expansion @xcite of the average time evolution hamiltonian . while the pioneering studies described dynamical decoupling with equidistant deterministic pulse sequences , a variety of approaches to the original idea were developed in order to optimize these sequences further @xcite .",
    "the concept of randomly chosen pulses was introduced as well @xcite , and it was shown that under certain conditions random dynamical decoupling could outperform the deterministic approach @xcite .",
    "a hybrid scheme combining the advantages of both approaches allows for additional improvements @xcite . in the case of the protected system being a simple two - state quantum system , i.e. , a qubit",
    ", dynamical decoupling techniques were applied with success in many experimental works @xcite .",
    "dynamical decoupling schemes are particularly promising in the field of quantum computing where decoherence poses a serious hurdle in experiments .",
    "decoupling techniques are able to drastically improve the coherence time of qubit states and of single- or two - qubit operations over the unprotected case . in theory",
    ", the achievable fidelity is limited only by the strength of the uncorrected higher orders of the average hamiltonian and the time between decoupling pulses . in practice , however , we have to expect an additional fidelity decay from experimental realities , such as additional interactions on the qubits outside of the studied hamiltonian interaction or imperfections in the measurement . furthermore , we also have to consider imperfect decoupling controls .",
    "in theory it is often assumed that the decoupling pulses are perfect and happen instantaneously ( infinitesimal width ) , which is an assumption that can not hold in practice . in @xcite ,",
    "the effects of finite - width pulses were studied .",
    "the article also introduced a jitter pulse with uniformly distributed random parameters and examined its effects on a concatenated dynamical decoupling sequence .    in this paper",
    "we propose a different model for imperfect dynamical decoupling control described by a linear quantum stochastic differential equation with a standard wiener process .",
    "we conduct a rigorous analysis of its effects on dynamical decoupling performance .",
    "in particular , we derive the generator of the time evolution and study its form in the limit of continuous control , which allows us to predict the robustness of different decoupling sequences against decoherence in our error model .",
    "numerical simulations for finite numbers of pulses and upper bounds on the rate of convergence are also provided . while the model is phenomenological in nature , it is our hope that the results can help gain a deeper understanding of real - world decoupling procedures .",
    "our work is particularly inspired by a recent experimental publication @xcite which demonstrated , for different pulse sequences , that individual pulse imperfections can accumulate , but also compensate each other .",

    "[ sec : decoupling ] we briefly review the dynamical decoupling method and introduce our stochastic noise model .",
    "we derive the resulting time evolution with the help of ito calculus by using an approach similar to , but more general than , the idea developed in @xcite . in sec . [",
    "sec : examples ] we explore the effects of our noise model on a few exemplary systems in both finite- and infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "we present upper bounds for the convergence of our model depending on the number of pulses employed .",
    "detailed derivations and proofs which support the main text are collected in two appendixes .",
    "in the general formulation of dynamical decoupling we consider a closed quantum system under the influence of a constant hamiltonian .",
    "the goal is to control or protect a subpart of the full system , with the rest being treated as an environment .",
    "this is usually done by eliminating the interaction between the considered subpart and the rest of the system , while the free evolution of the subpart remains intact .",
    "in order to achieve this purpose we assume that , after fixed times @xmath0 , a unitary pulse @xmath1 can be applied to the subsystem instantaneously ( _ bang - bang _ control @xcite ) . with the right choice of pulses it is possible to drastically improve the lifetimes of quantum states in the subspace , and in the limit of continuous control @xmath2 we find perfect coherence preservation .    in the following we will model imperfect pulses @xmath1 to account for the fact that perfect instantaneous unitary pulses are not available in actual experiments . in our model",
    "we assume that the apparatus implementing the decoupling pulses @xmath1 causes a stochastic error over time to the controlled system .",
    "mathematically we introduce this error by means of an ito stochastic differential equation for the applied unitary pulses : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the original ideal pulse , the parameter @xmath5 stands for the strength of the disturbance , and @xmath6 is a classical wiener process .",

    "after time @xmath9 the time evolution is governed by the unitary operator @xmath26 the time parameter of @xmath27 for the pulses is a mathematical consequence of our intended noise model and should not be understood as the physical implementation time of the pulses .",
    "we want to study a global noise induced by the pulse - generating device which is governed by @xmath6 .",
    "mathematically we express the error by partitioning it over the @xmath24 pulses applied to the system , and due to the particular rescaling properties of the wiener process we have @xmath28 for @xmath29 and therefore @xmath30 our model is phenomenological in nature .",
    "since all pulses share the same random variable @xmath6 , they will introduce the same error to the system during a single run of the experiment .",
    "however , the error will be different for subsequent repetitions of the experiment .",
    "as such , this model captures imperfections due to changing conditions between experimental runs , which can not typically be avoided perfectly or might even happen deliberately , e.g. , through necessary recalibrations of the experimental apparatus .",
    "our aim is to calculate the derivative @xmath31 in order to determine the time evolution of the system with @xmath24 stochastic pulses applied .",

    "due to the added complexity of dealing with infinite hilbert spaces , we restrict ourselves to investigating the limit of large @xmath24 only .",
    "let us consider a model of two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators , which are defined on a countable - infinite dimensional hilbert space , i.e. , a tensor product of two symmetric fock spaces @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the domains of creation and annihilation operators are dense in the hilbert space of the harmonic oscillator and also equal , so none of the basis is excluded in the ergodic limiting procedure ( see appendix [ appendix1 ] ) .",
    "we model the system by the hamiltonian @xmath175 where @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) is the frequency of oscillator @xmath178 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath73 is the strength of the interaction .",
    "@xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) and @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of oscillators @xmath178 and @xmath7 .    to decouple system @xmath178 from system @xmath7 , we can use a decoupling pulse of the form @xmath183,\\ ] ] a result taken from @xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to the special case @xmath184 , so that the decoupling pulse is equal to @xmath185 , with @xmath186 the parity operator @xcite acting on system @xmath178 . at the limit @xmath40 , the joint system is governed by the hamiltonian",
    "[ see eq . ]",
    "@xmath187    next , we define the nature of the error by the self - adjoint operator : @xmath188 substituting @xmath7 into eq . , we find @xmath189 one observes that in the limit @xmath40 system @xmath7 evolves completely freely and system @xmath178 is governed by @xmath190dt-\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } [ a^\\dagger a , [ a^\\dagger a , \\rho_a]]dt \\nonumber \\\\ & -&i\\sqrt{\\gamma}[a^\\dagger a,\\rho_a ] dw_t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering the expansion of the density operator into photon - number states @xmath191 , @xmath192 and averaging over all realizations , the time evolution results in the model of a phase - damped oscillator , @xmath193-\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } [ a^\\dagger a , [ a^\\dagger a , \\rho_a]],\\ ] ] which has the solution @xmath194 the coherence between photon - number states is damped , whereas diagonal terms are not affected by the error of the pulse .",
    "this shows that prepared photon - number states can be protected in the context of this model .",
    "despite the fact that two harmonic oscillators are decoupled for large numbers of pulses , initially prepared coherent states of system @xmath178 are dephased by the imperfectness of the pulses .",
    "the model of two coupled harmonic oscillators can be extended to a model where a harmonic oscillator ( subsystem ) interacts with a collection of independent harmonic oscillators ( environment ) @xcite . for the case of @xmath40",
    "the environment and the subsystem can be decoupled completely by repeated application of the unitary pulse defined in eq . .",
    "as already seen , the pulse error affects only states which are superpositions of photon - number states .",
    "in the context of dynamical decoupling procedures we presented a model of imperfect pulses . an imperfect pulse is modeled by a linear quantum stochastic differential equation with a standard wiener process , and this proposal allows us to impose an overall decoherence on every system subjected to an imperfect dynamical decoupling sequence .",
    "this technical tool allowed us to derive the time evolution for any quantum system under the influence of such imperfect decoupling schemes and to study the limit of continuous control .",
    "the latter can be connected to von neumann s mean ergodic theorem which describes the limit as a projection operator .",
    "the projection operator projects the generator of the decoupling - free evolution on the commutant of the ideal pulse .",
    "our stochastic model is considered such that each imperfect pulse would yield the ideal pulse if the time difference between their application is zero .",
    "this construction is the main idea behind relating robust decoupling sequences to cases when the projection of the generator results in an error - free unitary evolution .",
    "if the projection does not give an error - free evolution , then the imperfectness will accumulate in time .",
    "however , experimental setups work with finite numbers of pulses , and therefore we made an attempt to quantify the convergence towards the projection operator with inequalities .",
    "the motivation for this particular model can also be understood from the point of view of an open quantum system , where the pulse generator apparatus may be considered as an ancillary system coupled to the joint system of the protected and of the irrelevant quantum system .",
    "it is assumed that a markovian model is obtained during the elimination of the ancillary system and therefore a mathematically equivalent dynamics of stochastic evolution is considered for each individual pulse .",
    "this implies that the self - adjoint error operator @xmath7 is directly originating from the interaction hamiltonian between the ancilla system and the rest ( protected plus irrelevant ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our model contains an important assumption , namely , that the stochastic equation describing the imperfection of the pulse gives rise to dynamics on a coarse - grained time axis , which can not resolve effects on the time scale of the ancillary system s correlation time .",
    "however , when increasing the number of pulses , the time between two consecutive pulses decreases .",
    "therefore , at some point the time scale of the ancillary system s correlation time is reached .",
    "this case is beyond the scope of our model .",
    "thus the limit of an infinite number of pulses , @xmath40 , has to be understood strictly as a mathematical limit because @xmath24 is upper bounded by the ratio of the available decoupling time divided by the correlation time of the ancillary system .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the total decoupling times are @xmath195 and @xmath196 ms and the ancillary system is an optical microwave system , whose correlation times are on the order of nanoseconds .",
    "therefore , the critical number of pulses is around several thousand .",
    "the highest number of pulses used in this experiment was 1000 , which is below that threshold .",
    "in general , recent experiments employ a number of decoupling pulses in the range of 10 to 1000 , for which our markovian error model should be sufficiently detailed .",
    "we carefully investigated the effects of our imperfect control pulses in a qubit - qubit model and presented analytical results in the limit of continuous control .",
    "we also studied the case of finite numbers of pulses and presented numerical simulation results demonstrating how different types of errors influence the evolution of different initial states .",
    "these results were then applied to a more complex model of an electron spin coupling to a nuclear spin bath .",
    "we also briefly discussed the case of infinite dimensional hilbert spaces using the example of two coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "it is our hope that both this model and its application to the presented systems can shed some light on experimental findings which are not in agreement with the theory of ideal dynamical decoupling .",
    "this work is supported by the bmbf project q.com .",
    "in this appendix we reconsider and make more rigorous the proof of ref .",
    "@xcite given for the convergence of the decoupling procedures .",
    "we begin with some general and well - known statements .",
    "let @xmath20 be a hilbert space and define a bounded linear operator @xmath197 on @xmath20 .",
    "the null space and range of @xmath198 , with @xmath199 being the identity operation acting on @xmath20 , is given by @xmath200 now , we prove an elementary but useful property of these sets in the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath203 be the adjoint of @xmath204 defined by @xmath205 implying @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the inner product on @xmath20 .",
    "an element @xmath208 fulfills @xmath209 , which implies that @xmath210 for all @xmath211 .",
    "the latest equation satisfies the relation @xmath212 which is equivalent to the statement @xmath213 .",
    "thus @xmath214 .",
    "first let @xmath221 . using the norm",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the inner product of @xmath20 , we have @xmath224 where we used the subadditivity and the positive homogeneity properties of the norm .",
    "the statement that @xmath204 is unitary is equivalent to @xmath225 for all @xmath211 . by a repeated application of this statement",
    ", we can now conclude that latexmath:[\\[\\label{notclosed }    as @xmath40 for any @xmath227 .",
    "@xmath228 is finite , because @xmath20 is a normed space , too . by proposition",
    "[ prop1 ] , @xmath229 , then it follows that @xmath230 we require that the derivation in eq .",
    "holds for all elements @xmath231 . using the definition of set closure",
    ", we have that @xmath232 there exists an @xmath233 such that @xmath234 . now , choose an @xmath235 such that for any @xmath236 @xmath237 then for all @xmath236 @xmath238 @xmath204 is a unitary operator , which implies that @xmath225 .",
    "then @xmath239 this shows that @xmath240 and proves the statement of the theorem for the orthogonal complement of @xmath219 , thereby supposing that @xmath241 .",
    "then , @xmath242 thus , the strong convergence holds on the whole @xmath20 .",
    "next , we will apply the theorem for dynamical decoupling schemes .",
    "let us consider the lowest order in the taylor expansion of the hamiltonian , which generates the time evolution of a system subject to multiple - pulse control .",
    "we consider an arbitrary number @xmath104 of pulses applied repeatedly .",
    "using eq . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the following limiting procedure : @xmath243 needs to be evaluated .",
    "we note that in the limit @xmath40 the right - hand side of the inequality tends to @xmath342 . from a practical point of view",
    "this means that for large enough numbers of applied random pulses @xmath343 the state of the system @xmath125 remains unchanged after the application of new cycles of pulses .",
