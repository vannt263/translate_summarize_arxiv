    "the synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in ultracold gas systems has attracted a lot of attention because of its importance in realizing a new tunable platform for nontrivial condensed matter phenomena  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the presence of soc is an essential part of topological insulators and superconductors  @xcite and systems for quantum anomalous hall effect  @xcite and topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the realization of soc in ultracold atomic gases has rapidly progressed in recent years .",
    "the equal mixing of rashba and dresselhaus soc has been realized firstly with bosons  @xcite and then with fermions  @xcite .",
    "many proposals have been suggested for experimental realization of rashba - only soc  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the realization of two - dimensional soc which can be transformed into either rashba or dresselhaus soc has been reported  @xcite .    in attractively interacting fermi gases , spin - orbit coupling can largely affect the formation of fermion pairs in transition to superfluid ( for reviews , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , tuning the strength of rashba soc can produce another type of crossover between a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of tightly bound molecules . in the fermi gases without soc , the bcs - bec crossover is typically implemented by controlling interparticle scattering length throughout the feshbach resonance  @xcite . in the presence of the soc , it has been suggested that a bec can be realized even at a fixed weak interaction where very strong soc can lead to the formation of the bosonic bound state called rashbon  @xcite .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover in spin - orbit - coupled fermi gases has been studied with various settings of soc , interaction , and dimensionality in the mean - field theory  @xcite , also in the beyond - mean - field approaches for three  @xcite and two dimensions  @xcite , and very recently by using the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method for the ground state in two dimensions  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a many - body correction to the estimates of superfluid transition temperature in two - dimensional fermi gases with rashba soc by employing the gorkov  melik - barkhudarov ( gm ) approach  @xcite .",
    "the gm correction incorporates the induced interaction due to the second - order particle - hole processes in the fermi sea , providing a simple extension of the bcs mean - field framework . in two - component fermi gases with attractive @xmath0-wave interaction , without soc , the screening effect of the induced interaction reduces critical temperature , for instance , by a ratio of about @xmath1 in three dimensions  @xcite and about @xmath2 in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the gm correction has been also extended to systems with mass imbalance  @xcite , optical lattices  @xcite , bec - bcs crossover  @xcite , spin - density polarization  @xcite , three - component gases  @xcite , polar molecules  @xcite , and spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .    here",
    "we address two important properties of soc that make the calculations of the induced interaction essentially different from the conventional case without soc .",
    "first , in the presence of soc , the spin components are mixed , forming the two helicity branches of energy dispersion .",
    "these mixed spin states can mediate an antiscreening particle - hole polarization in addition to the conventional screening one , which is analogous to the three - component gases where the third component induces such effect  @xcite .",
    "second , the mixed - spin - state character of the fermi sea abruptly changes across the soc - driven bcs - bec crossover  @xcite , which may substantially affect the medium contributions to the induced interaction .",
    "however , these properties are not included in the earlier consideration of the induced interaction for a spin - orbit - coupled system  @xcite .    in the calculation of superfluid transition temperature in the weakly interacting limit , we find that the correction effect with the induced interaction exhibits a crossover behavior between the weak and strong soc regimes which is attributed to the change of the fermi sea character . at zero soc",
    ", the transition temperature is confirmed to be reduced with the correction by a ratio of about @xmath3 . as the soc strength increases , this correction ratio decreases in the weak soc regime but then becomes insensitive to soc in the strong soc regime .",
    "the ratio in the strong soc limit is estimated to be about @xmath4 for the mean - field transition temperature , however the correction effect turns out to be much more suppressed in the estimate of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature . in addition , we calculate the condensate fraction for comparison with the recent ground - state qmc results  @xcite , showing significant improvement with the gm correction to the mean - field estimate .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "although , it is well known that the superfluid transition at finite temperature is still possible by the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) mechanism of the vortex - antivortex pairing  @xcite . in the spin - orbit - coupled fermi gases , the bkt transition temperature and superfluid properties have been estimated with consideration of the phase fluctuations in the order parameter beyond the mean - field approximation  @xcite .    regarding the gm correction , the following question naturally arises for the bkt transition temperature . at weak interactions",
    ", the previous result  @xcite shows that the bkt transition temperature recovers the mean - field estimate when the rashba soc strength is small , while in the strong soc limit , the bkt temperature largely deviates from the mean - field estimate .",

    "we suggest that in the weakly interacting limit , the gm correction may be applicable to the estimate of the bkt temperature by restricting the influence of the induced interaction within the mean - field or saddle - point gap equation .",
    "we follow the description of the phase fluctuations given in ref .  @xcite . in the procedures ,",
    "when the amplitude fluctuations of the order parameter is neglected , the amplitude is still determined from the same mean - field gap equation .",

    "the induced interaction is thus determined by a net effect of the antiscreening and conventional screening contributions .",
    "second , the induced interaction and corresponding correction to the superfluid transition temperature largely depends on the soc strength , which is attributed to the abrupt change of the fermi sea character across the soc - driven bcs - bec crossover .    in the estimate of the mean - field transition temperature in the weakly interacting limit , the correction due to the induced interaction shows a crossover behavior across the weak and strong soc regimes . at strong soc",
    ", it is found that the mean - field temperature is reduced by a ratio of about @xmath4 with the gm correction which is in contrast to the known value of about @xmath3 for the case without soc .",
    "this ratio decreases with increasing soc in the weak soc regime , but then it becomes largely insensitive to soc in the strong soc regime .",
    "the similar crossover is also found in our estimation of the bkt transition temperature at weak interactions .",
    "however , our calculation indicates that the correction becomes quantitatively very small in the strong soc limit in the case of the bkt transition temperature .",
    "the essence of the gm correction procedures is in the modification of the mean - field gap equation with the induced interaction . our comparison with the recent ground - state qmc result for the condensate fraction  @xcite shows remarkable improvement to the use of the usual mean - field order parameter , demonstrating the importance of the gm correction in a spin - orbit - coupled system .",
    "while exact numerics with soc for the transition temperature have not been available yet , our estimates with the gm correction would motivate applications of other beyond - mean - field approaches , for instance , with the functional renormalizaton group  @xcite , particle - hole fluctuations with self - energy renormalization  @xcite , non - gaussian fluctuation theory  @xcite , and @xmath133-matrix approaches  @xcite , to two - dimensional fermi gases with soc .",
    "in addition , we expect that it is also possible to extend our formulation of the gm correction to systems in three dimensions or with other types of soc , which would provide more improved mean - field - based predictions of experimental relevance .",
