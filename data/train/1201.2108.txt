    "the aim of this paper is to study the dynamics in the neighborhood of unstable periodic orbits in a rotating three dimensional ( hereafter 3d ) autonomous hamiltonian system of galactic type .",
    "instability of periodic orbits in such a dynamical system is of three kinds : simple , double and complex instability .",
    "the case of complex instability was studied in a recent paper by katsanikas et al ( katsanikas et al . 2011 ) . here",
    "we study the two other cases .",
    "furthermore , we examine the stickiness effects in our 3d system .",
    "this is the first time that the stickiness phenomenon is _ explicitly _ investigated in association with these kinds of instability ( simple and double ) in a 3d autonomous hamiltonian system . for this purpose",
    "we consider the intersections of the orbits by a space of section . in a 3d autonomous hamiltonian system",
    "the space of section has 4 dimensions .",
    "so , for the visualization of the 4d spaces of section it is convenient to use the method of color and rotation ( patsis & zachilas 1994 ) .",
    "rotation is used for understanding the geometry of a 3d projection and color is used to visualize the 4th dimension .",
    "3d rotating autonomous hamiltonian systems are of special importance in galactic dynamics .",
    "they represent in a realistic way rotating galaxies , in which rotation plays a key role in the dynamics on the equatorial plane , as well as in the third dimension .",
    "the most important family for the vertical morphology of rotating disk galaxies is a family called x1v1 by ( patsis et al .",
    "the x1v1 family is introduced at the transition from stability to simple instability ( @xmath0 ) as the stability of the central , planar family x1 undergoes a @xmath1 transition within a small jacobi integral interval at the vertical 2:1 resonance region ( for a definition of resonances in rotating galactic potentials see contopoulos pages 379 and 422 ) . at the @xmath2 transition , another family of periodic orbits ( hereafter p.o . ) ,",
    "x1v2 , is bifurcated from x1 as simple unstable ( skokos et al .",
    "2002 ) . for larger jacobi constants x1v2 becomes double unstable .",
    "thus , it possesses both kinds of instabilities we want to study . in this paper",
    "we focus on x1v2 and we examine the structure of the phase space in its neighborhood , when it is simple or double unstable .",
    "however , in order to investigate in depth the dynamics in the neighborhood of double unstable periodic orbits we will also study a case referring to z - axis orbits .",
    "the importance of the dynamical phenomena at the 2:1 vertical resonance is due to the role of the associated families in shaping the vertical morphology of the 3d disks .",
    "they form to a large extent the peanut - shaped structure , which is characteristic of many disk galaxies observed edge - on ( patsis et al 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , chaotic motion in the neighborhood of unstable p.o.s has been proven to be significant for the dynamics of rotating galactic disks _ on _ their equatorial planes ( for a review see e.g. contopoulos 2009 ) . in that respect the knowledge of the structure of phase space in the neighborhood of 3-dimensional p.o . in galactic systems",
    "is the first step for the investigation of a possible contribution of chaotic orbits to the observed vertical profiles of this type of galaxies .",
    "the space of section that we use in this paper for investigating the orbital behavior close to x1v2 orbits is defined by @xmath3 and we consider intersections with @xmath4 .",
    "hereafter by `` intersections '' we will refer to intersections , which fulfill these properties , until we start discussing the dynamics close to z - axis . then we will change space of section .",
    "every consequent in our cross section is determined by 4 cartesian coordinates , e.g. @xmath5 . in the method of color and rotation we project the consequents in a 3d subspace and observe them from different viewpoints . in the text",
    "the viewpoints are given in spherical coordinates .",
    "the unit for the distance @xmath6 of the consequents of the surface of section from the observer corresponds to the longest side of the bounding box of the figure ( more details can be found in katsanikas and patsis 2010 ) . in practice",
    "we rotate the 3d figure in the computer screen in order to find the most appropriate viewpoint for the presentation on the 2d surface of the pages of a paper .",
    "we select the viewpoint that represents best the morphology of the structures formed by the consequents in the 3d projections of the 4d space of section in order to facilitate the reader to follow our description .",
    "then we color every point according the value of its 4th coordinate . for this reason we use the `` mathematica '' package and",
    "we map the interval of the values of the fourth coordinate into @xmath7 $ ] .    * a well defined structure in all 3d projections and a smooth color variation along them is evidence for regular motion . *",
    "mixing of colors indicates chaotic behavior of the consequents in 4d ( patsis & zachilas 1994 , katsanikas & patsis 2010 )      the linear stability of the periodic orbits is studied , following the analysis by broucke ( broucke 1969 ) in the case of the elliptic restricted three body problem and the method used by hadjidemetriou ( hadjidemetriou 1975 ) in the three body problem .",
    "the method has been also described in a recent earlier paper of us in the series of papers studying the dynamics in the neighborhood of p.o . in 3d rotating galactic potentials ( katsanikas & patsis 2010 ) .",
    "the characteristic equation in a 3d autonomous hamiltonian system is of the form @xmath8 . and has 4 eigenvalues @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the stability of the p.o . depends on the two stability indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 and on the quantity @xmath19 .    for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , all four eigenvalues are on the unit circle in the complex plane and the orbit is called stable @xmath22 ( see e.g. contopoulos 2002 , contopoulos & magnenat 1985 )",
    ".    then we have three kinds of instability :    1 .",
    "simple instability @xmath23 : @xmath24 and @xmath25 or @xmath26 , ( two eigenvalues on the unit circle and two on the real axis ) 2 .",
    "double instability @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( four eigenvalues on the real axis ) 3 .",
    "complex instability ( @xmath31 ) ( all four complex eigenvalues are off the unit circle in the complex plane ) : @xmath32    ( for details see contopoulos 2002 , p.286 )",
    ". hereafter we will indicate the periodic orbits as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 according to their stability .",
    "a generalization of the three kinds of instability in hamiltonian systems of @xmath37 degrees of freedom can be found in skokos ( skokos 2001 ) .    in section 2",
    "we present our hamiltonian system . in section 3",
    "we discuss the stability of a family of p.o .",
    "we call x1v2 . in section 4",
    "we study the orbital behavior close to simple unstable orbits of x1v2 , in section 5 we investigate the dynamical behavior in the neighborhood of double unstable orbits of x1v2 , as well as of the z - axis families , in section 6 we compare the diffusion of the chaotic orbits away from the p.o . and",
    "finally in section 7 we discuss and enumerate our conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system in cartesian coordinates is :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the potential :    @xmath40 ^ 2)^{1/2}}- % \\nonumber\\\\   \\frac{gm_{2}}{(x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{q_a^2 } + [ a_{2}+(\\frac{z^2}{q_b^2}+b_{2}^2 ) ^{1/2}]^2)^{1/2 } } % \\nonumber\\\\\\ ] ]    this potential in its axisymmetric form @xmath41 can be considered as an approximation of the potential of the milky way ( miyamoto & nagai 1975 ) .    in our units",
    ", the distance @xmath42=1 corresponds to 1  kpc .",
    "the velocity unit corresponds to 209.64  @xmath43 .",
    "the jacobi constant @xmath44 corresponds to 43950 @xmath45 and we will call it `` energy '' . for the parameters we have used the following values : @xmath46 . for the angular velocity we used the value @xmath47 in our units .",
    "the parameters @xmath48 determine the geometry of the disks , while @xmath49 are scaling factors .",
    "the specific values of the geometrical parameters do not have a particular physical meaning .",
    "the dynamical phenomena we study in our paper are typical for rotating triaxial systems .",
    "the @xmath50 value we use here is different from the one we used in ( katsanikas & patsis 2010 ) in order to have larger regions in the parameters space with non - escape orbits close to double unstable periodic orbits ( section 5 ) .",
    "in order to study the evolution of the stability of a family of periodic orbits as a parameter of our system varies we use the stability diagram ( contopoulos 2002 p.287 ) .",
    "the stability diagram gives the values of the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 for successive periodic orbits in a family by changing only one parameter of the system ( in our case @xmath51 ) , while keeping the other parameters constant . in fig .",
    "[ dsimple1 ] we observe in such a diagram how the family of periodic orbits x1v2 ( skokos et al .",
    "2002 ) bifurcates from the 2d central family x1 on the plane @xmath52 at the @xmath53 transition that happens in the vertical 2:1 resonance region ( contopoulos 2002 p.390 ) .",
    "this bifurcation occurs for @xmath54 .",
    "we observe that the stability parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 of the family x1v2 decrease as @xmath51 increases .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is initially about @xmath55 at @xmath56 ( left side of diagram ) .",
    "when @xmath18 becomes @xmath57 we have a transition of x1v2 from simple to double instability ( @xmath58 ) ( for @xmath59 ) and the x1v2 periodic orbits become double unstable .",
    "the @xmath51 interval of x1v2 , where it is simple unstable ( @xmath60 ) and the @xmath51 interval of x1v2 where it is double unstable ( @xmath61 ) , will be called hereafter regions u and du respectively ( fig .",
    "[ dsimple1 ] ) .",
    "first we study the orbital behavior of the x1v2 family in the region u. in the following applications we use the set of projections @xmath62 and @xmath63 . however , we find qualitatively similar results by using the @xmath64 and @xmath65 projections respectively .",
    "the use of the two projections gives us all needed information to understand the structure of the distribution of the consequents in the 4d space by means of the color - rotation method , as we will see below .",
    "the initial conditions to be studied are chosen in two different ways .",
    "first we investigate the dynamical behavior of the orbits in the neighborhood of the simple unstable periodic orbit x1v2 at @xmath66 by varying the values and the direction ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) of the perturbation .",
    "secondly , we consider a constant perturbation @xmath71 and we apply this perturbation to the initial conditions of several periodic orbits of the x1v2 family in the region u for different @xmath51 values .",
    "we start by keeping @xmath51 constant and investigate as a sample case the dynamical behavior very close to the point where we have the @xmath53 transition of the x1 family and the bifurcation of the family x1v2 as @xmath34 .",
    "the energy @xmath66 is indicated with an arrow in fig .",
    "[ dsimple1 ] .",
    "the periodic orbit has initial conditions @xmath72 . in order to study the orbital behavior in its neighborhood we added a small perturbation in the @xmath73-direction equal to @xmath74 .",
    "we call this perturbed orbit `` u '' .",
    "the first 2580 consequents of orbit `` u '' define a ribbon of the form of a double loop in the @xmath62 subspace ( fig .",
    "[ dsimple2 ] ) . in the bottom of the figure we give also from left to right the 2d projections @xmath75 and @xmath76 in order to help the reader understand the topology of the structure .",
    "the two lobes of the double loop are inclined with respect to each other and form an angle around @xmath77 in the @xmath78 projection ( middle panel in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ dsimple2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath78 projection clearly also shows that the thickness of the lobes is very small ( but not zero ) and this is the reason we describe them as ribbons .",
    "essentially the branches of the lobes are thin tubes .",
    "the 4d representation of this structure , colored according to the normalized @xmath73 values and using @xmath62 for the 3d spatial projection is given in fig .",
    "[ dsimple2 ] ( top ) .",
    "for the 3d projection we use here a point of view defined by the angles @xmath79 .",
    "we observe that this ribbon has a smooth color variation from red to violet , in agreement with structures found in the neighborhood of simple periodic @xmath23 orbits by patsis and zachilas ( 1994 ) .",
    "the structure of the phase space close to simple unstable periodic orbits has been studied for the first time by magnenat ( 1982 ) .",
    "however , magnenat used 2d projections and these did not allow the full understanding of the 4d structure of the double loop objects . in the present case",
    ", our 4d representation allows us to understand the details of this structure .    by inspection of fig .",
    "[ dsimple2 ] we infer that the color variation along the two branches is such that at the intersection region we have the meeting of two different shades .",
    "this means that in this region the points have different values in the 4th dimension and there is no real intersection in the 4d space of section .",
    "consequently the ribbon - like double loop structure has not an intersection in 4d .",
    "we observe that the colors at the region of the intersection are not only different , but that they are at the two extremes of our color scale , i.e. violet and red ( see right side of fig .",
    "[ dsimple2 ] ) .",
    "the colors in this region are clustered around two values @xmath80 very close to the @xmath73 initial condition of the periodic orbit @xmath81 .",
    "figure [ dsimple2 ] reflects the symmetry of the galactic potential we study . due to this symmetry , the families of p.o . that bifurcate at the vertical resonances from the planar x1 family come in pairs with mirror morphology with respect to the equatorial plane of the system in the configuration space , i.e. x1v1 and x1v1@xmath82 , x1v2 and x1v2@xmath82 etc . the p.o .",
    "of x1v2 and x1v2@xmath82 at every @xmath51 differ only in the sign of their @xmath83 initial conditions . in the 3d @xmath62 projection we use in fig .",
    "[ dsimple2 ] , the initial conditions of x1v2 and x1v2@xmath82 are identical and the p.o .",
    "is in the center of the intersection region of the two branches of the double loop ribbon ( indicated with an arrow ) .",
    "the clustering of the colors around the two values @xmath84 in the central region is due to the coexistence of x1v2 and x1v2@xmath82 .",
    "the consequents drift away from the central region of the double loop by deviating from the two @xmath85 initial conditions with different colors .",
    "the first 2580 consequents are along the double loop structure , thus they indicate a regular rather than chaotic motion .",
    "we reach the same conclusion by using other 3d projections for the spatial coordinates of the consequents . in fig .",
    "[ dsimple3 ] the first 2580 consequents of the orbit `` u '' in the 3d projection @xmath63 form again a ribbon - like surface , however this time with a single loop morphology . color is determined by the @xmath86 value of the consequents and we observe a smooth color variation along the ribbon . in this case",
    "the two representatives of the p.o x1v2 and x1v2@xmath82 are at two different positions in the @xmath63 space , since they have different @xmath83 initial conditions .",
    "their positions are indicated with arrows in fig .",
    "[ dsimple3 ] .",
    "the regions close to both of them are colored red ( same @xmath86 values ) and departing from them , red becomes orange , then yellow , green , light blue , blue and finally violet .",
    "the ribbon is a 4d object . from both figs .",
    "[ dsimple2 ] and [ dsimple3 ] we conclude that the first 2580 consequents form a well - defined ribbon - like surface that has no self - intersections in 4d",
    ".    a similar analysis can be done by means of the two other 3d projections @xmath87 and @xmath65 , which give 4d structures morphologically similar to @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "it is evident that the orbit `` u '' in the neighborhood of a @xmath34 x1v2 p.o . for 2580 consequents",
    "is confined in a particular region of the space of section with dimensions ( @xmath88 .",
    "as we will see below , for larger integration times the orbit diffuses to a larger region of the phase space .",
    "the structures we find in the phase space indicate a sticky behavior and this will be further analyzed in section 4.4 .",
    "cc +    cc +    we note that although in general we have different colors in the intersections of double loop type structures , like the one in fig .",
    "[ dsimple2]a , in exceptional cases we can have also real intersections in the 4d space .",
    "such a case is encountered in the neighborhood of @xmath34 z - axis orbits in 4d spaces of section defined by @xmath52 .",
    "the z - axis orbits lie entirely on the rotational , z axis , of the system .",
    "they have initial conditions @xmath89 and are discussed in detail in section 5.2 in the context of the study of double instability .",
    "if we compute a larger number of intersections we observe a drastic change in the topology of the ribbon - like surface .",
    "the points deviate from the well - defined 4d structures that we described above and form a cloud of points around them in the 3d projections with mixed colors in their 4d representations .",
    "however , in the particular case we study here , for about 3580 intersections , i.e. for 1000 consequents more than those building the structures in figs .",
    "[ dsimple2 ] and [ dsimple3 ] , in the 3d projections that include the @xmath90 and @xmath73 coordinates we discern a structure ( i.e. a greek letter @xmath91 rotated by @xmath92 ) surrounded by a ring .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ dsimple7 ] , where we depict the consequents of the orbit `` u '' in a @xmath63 projection and color them according to their @xmath86 values .",
    "this new structure in the 3d projection of the phase space is maintained for several thousands of intersections more .",
    "we have again a confinement of the consequents in a restricted volume of the phase space , which is larger than previously .",
    "after 3580 intersections the consequents extend within a region ( @xmath93 . in the new situation we have on one hand the appearance of structures in certain projections which indicates order , and on the other hand mixing of colors , which indicates chaoticity .",
    "cc +    the origin of the observed structure can be understood best in the ( @xmath94 ) projection ( fig .",
    "[ x1v1v2 ] ) .",
    "we remind that we study the structure of phase space in the region u , which starts with the bifurcation of the family x1v2 at the @xmath53 transition of x1 in the vertical 2:1 resonance region ( fig .",
    "[ dsimple1 ] ) . for smaller energies in the resonance region , at @xmath95",
    ", we have the @xmath0 transition of x1 and the introduction in the system of the stable family x1v1 ( and its symmetric family x1v1@xmath96 ) .",
    "thus for @xmath66 , we have , apart from the two simple unstable p.o . x1v2 and x1v2@xmath96 , the two stable x1v1 and x1v1@xmath96 and the planar stable x1 .",
    "the presence of all these simple periodic orbits determines the orbital behavior of `` u '' in the following way :    in the central part of fig .",
    "[ x1v1v2]a we observe a red `` ellipse with corners '' , which forms within the first 2580 intersections and which is the projection of the structure of fig ;  [ dsimple3 ] in the ( @xmath94 ) plane .",
    "the initial conditions of x1v2 and x1v2@xmath96 are located at the upper and lower corner of the red elliptical curve respectively .",
    "the blue ellipse inside the red one is the projection of a rotational torus ( vrahatis et al .",
    "1997 ) belonging to a quasiperiodic orbit found by perturbing x1 in the @xmath73 direction . during the first 2580 consequents the orbit `` u '' stays sticky to the outer 4d rotational tori of x1 .",

    "as we know , stickiness in chaos refers to chaotic orbits that stay in a particular region of the phase space , before escaping to large distances . in 2d",
    "autonomous hamiltonian systems stickiness appears near the borders of stability islands , as well as near the asymptotic curves of the unstable manifolds for a long time ( contopoulos & harsoula 2008 , contopoulos & harsoula 2010 ) . in our paper",

    "[ dstic3 ] , the first 1000 consequents , after the departure of the consequents from part a of the unstable manifold , remain close to the asymptotic curves of part b of the unstable manifold .",

    "the figure resembles what is found in 2d systems close to the last kam curve ( contopoulos 2002 ) . however , we should have in mind that in the 4d space of section of our 3d hamiltonian system consequents can be found on both sides of a torus , moving through the additional dimensions .",
    "cc    in section 4.2 we said that for the values of perturbation listed in table 1 , the orbits go directly around the rotational tori of x1v1 and x1v1@xmath82 .",
    "all these orbits have also a sticky behavior at the borders of the x1v1 and x1v1@xmath82 4d stability islands , which we can always see best in the 3d projection @xmath63 and the 2d projection @xmath100 . in all other projections",
    "the sticky regions are discernible as denser regions of the phase space embedded in clouds .",
    "the @xmath63 projection has the advantage that in a certain range of viewing angles only a few consequents from the cloud are projected in the regions , which look `` empty '' ( actually they are occupied by the rotational tori around the stable orbits ) .",

    "the consequents follow the manifolds that wind around the tori .",
    "thus it would be more accurate to associate these structure of the phase space mainly with the @xmath53 transitions , as they are not expected to exist away from such a transition point or after a @xmath146 transition .",
    "double instability in rotating galactic potentials usually appears for large energies . in the x1 orbital tree ( skokos et al 2002 ) @xmath35 appears in higher order bifurcations , when a stable 3d bifurcation of x1 becomes first simple unstable and then double unstable , or when a simple unstable bifurcation of x1 becomes double unstable .",

    "these chaotic orbits are sticky and play a very important role , especially in galactic dynamics , since the stickiness time is in many cases of the order of a hubble time or even larger . *",

    "this allows us to visualize the unstable eigensurface corresponding to the @xmath35 periodic orbit .",
    "we find sticky chaotic orbits whose consequents stay close to the unstable manifold for very long times ( of the order of a hubble time or more ) .",
    "we find these sticky orbits either by perturbing the initial conditions of the z - axis @xmath35 p.o .",
    ", or by perturbing orbits on rotational tori associated with the stable anomalous orbit ( sao ) and its symmetric family .",

    "they are much slower than the diffusion speeds of the orbits in the neighborhood of x1v2 simple unstable periodic orbits away from its bifurcation point , or of the double unstable orbits of the same family that have eigenvalues of very different size .",
