    "recent observations have revealed a small population of stars that bear many of the hallmarks of low - mass pre  main - sequence stars but lie far from any obvious region of recent star formation ( as revealed by substantial dark clouds of molecular gas and dust ) .",
    "gregorio - hetem  ( 1992 ) identified 33 candidate t tauri stars based on spectroscopy of stars in the _ iras _ point source catalog and a few additional emission - line stars .",
    "one of the more interesting findings of their work was the identification of four stars ( hd 98800 , , , and ) within 10  of tw hya , earlier identified as a possible isolated t tauri star by rucinski & krautter ( 1983 ) .",
    "the proximity of these five systems to each other suggested a possible loose cluster of young stars , possibly formed by a small molecular cloud that has since dissipated ( e.g. , feigelson 1996 ) .    in the absence of association with any known cloud complex ,",
    "the distances to these stars were very uncertain , and thus their pre  main - sequence status was in question .",
    "to investigate whether two of these stars ,  and , are in fact young and whether they are part of a larger group of young stars , we observed them with the  x - ray satellite .",
    "one distinguishing feature of low - mass pre ",
    "main - sequence stars is strong x - ray emission , presumed to arise from solar - like chromospheric activity ( see , e.g. ,  1997 for a recent review ) .",
    "thus , x - ray observations can be used to search for young stars that may not have other hallmarks of youth such as infrared excesses or strong h@xmath6 emission .",
    "observations of taurus - auriga with the _ einstein _ satellite led to the discovery of the naked t tauri stars , stars that have no circumstellar material but that are nonetheless coeval with classical t tauri stars ( walter 1986 ) .",
    "much observational attention has been focused on the stars in the vicinity of tw hya recently , and several other investigations have proceeded in parallel with ours .",
    "kastner  ( 1997 ) reported  observations of some of the same stars we report on here .",
    "they found that the strength of x - ray emission from these stars is consistent with them being young stars and argued that the five young stars in this area make up a physical association .",
    "hoff   ( 1996 , 1998 ) investigated tw hya and  and their surroundings with low spatial resolution using  pspc pointed observations .",
    "soderblom  ( 1998 ) and wichmann  ( 1998 ) report hipparcos distances to hd 98800 and tw hya , respectively ; both systems have ages of @xmath1 12 @xmath7 yr and distances of @xmath8 pc .",
    "the work we report here is complementary to this other recent work .",
    "we analyze the x - ray data of our target stars in more detail than kastner  ( 1997 ) and explore the status of other x - ray sources in the surrounding fields .",
    "we also combine x - ray and hipparcos data to search for other young stars in the vicinity in order to address the larger question of the origin of these isolated young stars .    in  [ sec : observations ] we report the details of our observations . in",
    "[ sec : xproperties ] we show that the x - ray properties of the two target stars are consistent with their being  ( pms ) stars .",
    "we then investigate (  [ sec : othermembers ] ) whether there is any evidence that the young stars near tw hya formed as a group , using our x - ray observations as well as data from the hipparcos satellite .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of isolated young stars .",
    "observations of  and  were made with the high resolution imager ( ) aboard .",
    "the telescope consists of four nested wolter type i mirrors with a peak effective area of almost 1000 @xmath9 ( trmper 1983 ) .",
    "the , described in david   ( 1997 ) , uses a two microchannel plate detector with a csi photocathode .",
    "the mirror and detector combination is sensitive to x - rays with energies between 0.1 kev and 2.4 kev .",
    "its very good spatial resolution is characterized by a response function having an on - axis fwhm of about 5 .",
    "it has a field of view with an approximate diameter of 40 .    with a low and well understood background ,",
    "has a sensitivity that is the best of any current or past large x - ray telescope .",
    "the minimum detectable flux in our observations is about @xmath10 ergs s@xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the sensitivity declines slightly with off - axis angle , reaching 85 percent of the on - axis value at 20 for 1 kev photons . because of the good sensitivity and spatial resolution the is well suited to identifying point sources in potentially crowded fields .",
    "the pointed observations were made consecutively over a period of 20 days .",
    "the  observations took place from 1994 december 28 to 1995 january 7 with an effective exposure time of 23,051 s. the   observations took place from 1995 january 9 to 17 with an effective exposure time of 30,604 s.    in both fields the central stars (  and , respectively ) are the brightest x - ray sources , but in each case several other sources are also visible . to locate all statistically significant sources we used the source detection algorithms in the midas / exsas software package ( january 1995 version , zimmermann  1993 ) .",
    "these algorithms use a three - step process in which sources first are located using a sliding window technique . next a background map",
    "is made by excluding these sources and the sliding window search is repeated using the new background determination .",
    "finally a maximum likelihood statistic @xmath13 is calculated for each possible point source using the background map and knowledge of the point spread function .",
    "we used a maximum likelihood threshold value of 8 , which corresponds to a probability that a spurious source is identified at a given position of @xmath14 .    before extracting the identified sources we examined the radial profiles .",
    "in general the source count rate became indistinguishable from the background level by 20 .",
    "we chose a radius for each source extraction circle accordingly .",
    "we then extracted a background sample from a nearby , source - free region of the detector .",
    "the background count rate was scaled to the area of the source extraction circle and was subtracted from the source .",
    "the net count rate was then computed by summing over all 16 energy channels .    in the  field we detected nine x - ray sources , and",
    "in the   field we detected six sources . in tables [ table : sources - hd ] and [ table : sources - cd ] we list the sources detected in the two fields , their positions , count rates , and fluxes . in each field",
    "the central star is more than an order of magnitude brighter in x - rays than any of the other sources ; there are no x - ray sources in these fields of comparable brightness to the previously - known pms stars hd 98800 and .",

    "the reddening of both  and  is negligible , implying that interstellar attenuation of the x - rays is also negligible .",
    "we derived the fluxes of the central stars of the two fields assuming a raymond and smith isothermal model having a temperature of @xmath46 k and attenuated by an interstellar column of @xmath47 @xmath12 .",
    "this procedure effectively gave a count rate to flux conversion factor , which we then used for each of the other stars in the fields .",
    "this factor , of roughly @xmath48 ergs s   @xmath12 count , is in good agreement with the values listed in the  handbook ( david  1997 ) .",
    "we note that the count rate to flux conversion factor varies by no more than 30 percent over the range of spectral parameters @xmath49 kev and @xmath50 @xmath12 .",
    "this range of @xmath51 values corresponds to visual extinctions of @xmath52 to 0.05 magnitudes , consistent with the observed low extinction toward the central sources in our fields .",
    "we use this same value to convert the fluxes in all of the sources .",
    "this assumption will be valid if the other sources are pms stars or late - type main sequence stars at a distance similar to the central star in each field .",
    "if the sources are background sources then their intrinsic fluxes will tend to be higher than our estimates , due to the probable underestimate of the interstellar absorption .",
    "the fluxes are listed in tables [ table : sources - hd ] and [ table : sources - cd ] ; the flux uncertainties quoted are derived from the uncertainties in the count rates added in quadrature with an assumed 15% uncertainty in the count rate to flux conversion .",
    "the x - ray fluxes of  and  combined with their @xmath53 magnitudes ( soderblom  1998 , gregorio - hetem  1992 ) and bolometric corrections ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) give  ratios of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",

    "assuming the same distance for  gives @xmath58 .",
    "the strength of x - ray emission from  and  is consistent with the interpretation that they are pms stars ; their x - ray luminosities are within the ranges found by   ( 1995 ) for t tauri stars in taurus and are higher than all but the few most x - ray - luminous stars in the pleiades or hyades (   1997 ) .",
    "even if the x - ray luminosity of  is divided equally among the four stars in the quadruple system ( torres   1995 ) , the x - ray luminosity of each star is comparable to that from pms stars .",
    "the  values are also in the range found for taurus pms stars (  1995 ) .",
    "the observations of  and  each span about ten days , and because of their relatively high count rates we can address the issue of time variability using these data . because is in low - earth orbit the data are in sections of @xmath59 s , separated by slightly longer ( and occasionally much longer ) intervals .",
    "individual orbits provide convenient time bins for tests of variability on timescales of hours .",
    "we also divided the data into 100 s bins to test for shorter - term variability .    in figure [ figure :",
    "lc ] we show the light curves for each of the two stars with the 2500 s bins . in both stars there is a flare - type event with a rise time of approximately one day . for  the amplitude of the event",
    "is at least 90 percent above the mean count rate . for",
    "it is at least 40 percent . in both cases the  count rates returned to the pre - flare levels within one day of reaching their peaks .",
    "there is very little variability on shorter timescales as determined from the light curves with the 100 s bins .",
    "we fit the light curves from each separate orbit with a constant source model . in almost every case",
    "the data from each orbit are consistent with a constant source flux , although this constant source flux level is different for each orbit . for  only 2 out of 12 orbits",
    "show short term variability with a significance greater than 95 percent . for   only 1 out of 14 orbits",
    "shows short term variability above this significance level .",
    "the standard deviation of the source counts in the 100 s bins for each orbit is typically 20 percent of the mean count rate for that orbit , which is similar to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "we can therefore conclude that very little variability with amplitudes greater than 20 percent is seen on timescales of minutes , and none of this short timescale variability has an amplitude greater than 40 percent .",
    "while x - ray flares are seen in late - type stars of all ages ( schmitt 1994 ) , the presence of flares in both of our targets within a relatively short time suggests that these stars are part of an active population .",
    "gagn  ( 1995 ) estimated that late - type pleiades cluster members ( ages @xmath60 yr ) undergo large flares roughly 1% of the time .",
    "thus , if our target stars have a similar flaring frequency , the probability that we would observe a @xmath1 1 day flare in a single 10-day observation of a given star was @xmath1 10% .",
    "the probability that we would observe flares in _ both _ stars was about 1% .",
    "thus , the observations suggest a somewhat higher flaring frequency than that of the pleiades , consistent with younger ages for these stars .  & preibisch ( 1995 ) estimate an x - ray flare rate of roughly one flare every 40 days for t tauri stars in taurus - auriga . if the flare rate for  and  is similar to that of t tauri stars , this gives a @xmath1 25% probability that we would see a flare in a 10-day observation of one star , and a @xmath1 6% probability of seeing flares in both .",
    "this indicates that  and  are at least as active as t tauri stars , though the x - ray flare rate determined by  & preibisch ( 1995 ) is very uncertain .",
    "we conclude that the level of x - ray activity in  and  is consistent with their being young stars .",
    "although the   data sets do not afford us the opportunity to perform quantitative x - ray spectral fitting , we were able to perform some spectral modeling using the shorter pspc observations of  and  taken from the all - sky survey ( rass ) . with the rass",
    ", the whole sky has been observed with the pspc ( positional sensitive proportional counter ) , which offers moderate spectral resolution .",
    "the rass fluxes of the previously known five pms stars in this field have been presented by kastner  ( 1997 ) .",
    "however , they do not list hardness ratios , which are basic spectral information derived from the relative fluxes in the different energy bands of the pspc (  1995 ) , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 denote count rates in the soft ( 0.1 to 0.4 kev ) , medium ( 0.5 to 0.9 kev ) , and hard ( 0.9 to 2.1 kev ) pspc bands respectively , then @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; both ratios can range from @xmath65 to @xmath66 . ] .",
    "therefore , we include the basic spectral analysis below for all five stars .    in table",
    "[ table : rasspms ] , we list the five previously known pms stars with their maximum likelihood @xmath13 of existence as x - ray sources in the rass , as well as the rass exposure times , hardness ratios ( hr 1 and hr 2 ) , and x - ray fluxes , derived using an energy conversion factor of 1 count = @xmath67 erg s  @xmath12 ( schmitt  1995 ) .",
    "the hardness ratios were derived using the procedure given in neuhuser  ( 1995 ) .",

    "there is no _ a priori _ way to know how to divide the x - ray flux among the components .",
    "even a conclusion drawn from the hardness ratios may be in error , as the individual companions may have different ratios .",
    "the hardness ratios of the five stars in table [ table : rasspms ] can be compared to typical values for tts in taurus .",
    "neuhuser   ( 1995 ) found significantly different hardness ratios for classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) compared to weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) , which they interpreted to be due to more absorption of soft x - rays in ctts due to their circumstellar material .    adopting the usual dividing line of ew(h@xmath6 ) @xmath83   as boundary between ctts and wtts ( e.g. , bertout 1989 ) , tw hya , , and  are ctts while  and  are wtts .",
    "however , as noted by kastner  ( 1997 ) , some authors consider the presence of an infrared excess an additional criterion for classification as a ctts , and in the present case this criterion may be more relevant as an influence on the x - ray emission .",
    "using only the presence or absence of an infrared excess as the selection criterion switches the classification of  from wtts to ctts and  from ctts to wtts .",
    "for ctts in taurus , neuhuser  ( 1995 ) found mean hardness ratios of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where the errors given are the standard deviations .",
    "hence , all five stars , regardless of ctts or wtts status , show lower values , i.e.  softer x - ray emission .",
    "indeed , several of the stars have negative values of hr1 , softer than any of the tts observed in taurus by  ( 1995 ) .",
    "this may be partly due to lower interstellar extinction , since the stars are much closer than taurus .",
    "it also indicates the lack of molecular gas in the immediate vicinity of these stars , either because gas from their formation has dispersed or because they were formed elsewhere .",
    "tw hya , however , is thought to be viewed pole - on ( kastner  1997 ) .",
    "if so , even its substantial circumstellar disk would not contribute strongly to x - ray absorption , yielding low hardness ratios .",
    "for the other stars , the low hardness ratios even in those stars with infrared excesses may suggest that either they are also viewed pole - on , or that their circumstellar material is less attenuating than in taurus tts , possibly indicating disks with lower masses and/or larger grains than those typically found around ctts .",
    "thus , the x - ray luminosity and variability of  and  are consistent with those of pms stars .",
    "their x - ray spectral properties are somewhat different , perhaps reflecting the difference between their current environment and that in taurus - auriga .",
    "it has been suggested that  and , along with the other three stars in table [ table : rasspms ] , are part of an isolated group of young stars that formed together ( gregorio - hetem   1992 , feigelson 1996 , kastner  1997 ) . to test this idea , we searched for additional young stars in the area using both our x - ray observations and observations from hipparcos .",
    "our x - ray detections of  and  were within 3  of their optical positions , a typical value for the boresight offset of the hri ( david  1997 ) . to search for optical counterparts to the other x - ray sources , we used images of the hri fields from the digitized sky survey ( dss ; morrison 1995 ) .",
    "most previously - known x - ray sources observed by hri were detected with 10  of their catalog positions ( david  1997 ) .",
    "therefore , we set 10  as an upper limit for the permitted offset between the x - ray position and any candidate optical counterparts .",
    "the dss images were examined visually to identify optical sources within a 10-radius circle centered on each x - ray position . for each x - ray source , only one optical counterpart was found within this radius .",
    "the coordinates of the optical sources are given in tables [ table : opt - hd ] and [ table : opt - cd ] .",

    "the known  stars in taurus - auriga are distributed over an area roughly @xmath130 on the sky . within this area",
    ", there are several distinct subgroups with radii of @xmath1 0.51 pc and internal velocity dispersions of @xmath1312 km s@xmath11 ( jones & herbig 1979 , gomez  1993 ) .",
    "the group sizes are similar to the jeans length for the associated dark clouds and to the measured size of the clumps in the molecular gas , suggesting group formation from gravitational instabilities ( gomez  1993 ) .",
    "one of these small groups of stars placed at the distance ( @xmath1 50 pc ) and age ( @xmath1 10@xmath132 yr ) of hd 98800 would look quite different from its present day appearance in taurus .",
    "a velocity of 1 km s@xmath11 corresponds to a distance traveled of 10.2 pc in 10@xmath132 yr .",
    "thus , if it is not gravitationally bound , a group of this age at a distance of 50 pc should have an angular radius of order 10 .",
    "the intrinsic proper motions of any group members should also be relatively small ; a lateral motion of 1 km s@xmath11 at 50 pc gives 4.2 mas yr@xmath11 .",
    "indeed , the space motions of tw hya and  in the plane of the sky are only a few km s  ( see table [ table : cands ] and  [ section : kinematics ] ) .",
    "we used 11@xmath133 @xmath332@xmath134 ( j2000 ) , the mean ra and dec .",
    "of the five previously - known young stars in this area , as the center of our search area ; four of the five lie within @xmath1 5  of this point , with hd 98800 at @xmath1 8 .",
    "we searched an area 10  in radius and selected all stars from the hipparcos catalog with parallaxes in the range 15.524.3 mas .",
    "this is the range of the parallaxes of tw hya and hd 98800 plus or minus their 1@xmath135 uncertainties , corresponding to distances of 41.264.5 pc .",
    "thus , our search encompasses a volume of space roughly 10 pc in radius , centered on the five previously known young stars in this area .",
    "additional selection criteria ( which in practice excluded only a few stars ) were the presence of a @xmath136 measurement in the hipparcos catalog and a parallax uncertainty of less than 8.1 mas .",
    "this search yielded 60 stars .",
    "we rejected those with luminosity classes i , ii , or iii ( 3 stars ) and plotted the rest on an hr diagram .",
    "bolometric corrections and the conversion from spectral type to effective temperature were taken from kenyon & hartmann ( 1995 ) .",
    "for a few stars , no spectral type was available , and @xmath136 color was used instead .",
    "we did not correct for extinction ; since the effective temperature for most of the stars was determined from their spectral types rather than @xmath136 colors , the primary effect of any extinction will be to make stars appear fainter than they really are .",
    "since an unresolved binary companion can raise the apparent luminosity of a star by up to a factor of two , we selected as candidate young stars only those stars that lie more than a factor of two above the zero - age main sequence ( zams).-yr - old stars earlier than about f2 , since a line a factor of two above the zams intersects the 10@xmath132 yr isochrone at @xmath137 k. ] this yielded 11 stars , including hd 98800 and tw hya , the only two of the five previously known young stars that are in the hipparcos catalog .",

    "these hardness ratios are given in the following two columns .",
    "count rates from rass observations were converted to fluxes using the hardness ratios as above in  [ sec : spectral ] .",
    "the final column gives the x - ray luminosity .",
    "cd @xmath336@xmath47429 has hardness ratios and  in the range of values given for the young stars in table [ table : rasspms ] .",
    "as discussed in the following section , its transverse velocity is also the closest to that of hd 98800 and tw hya , suggesting a possible physical relationship .",
    "cd @xmath328@xmath48704 and hd 96771 are fainter in x - rays than the previously - known young stars near tw hya .",
    "however , the x - ray emission levels of these stars are not unheard of for t tauri stars ; feigelson  ( 1993 ) found a mean x - ray luminosity of @xmath142 for t tauri stars in chamaeleon .",
    "the fact that cd @xmath328@xmath48704 and hd 96771 are detected only at the 23 @xmath135 level indicates that their x - ray fluxes are near the sensitivity limit imposed by the short exposure times of the rass , which could account for the non - detection of some of the other stars .",
    "however , the fact that none of the g stars in table [ table : cands ] were detected in x - rays suggests that they may be older , since pms g stars tend to have higher x - ray luminosities than pms stars of later spectral types ( feigelson  1993 , gagn   1995 ,  1995 ) .",

    "five of them were observed in the h and k lines by henry  ( 1996 ) . of these ,",
    "three were classified as `` inactive '' ; only hd 99076 was classified as `` active '' .",
    "hd 98800 was observed but was not classified in either of these groups due to the difficulty of determining the underlying photospheric level near the h and k lines for cooler stars ; it has h and k emission that is stronger than most field stars of its color ( soderblom  1996 ) .",
    "the lack of strong x - ray emission from most of these stars suggests that some of them may be @xmath155-yr - old subgiants that are just leaving the main sequence rather than @xmath46-yr - old pms stars .",
    "however , early f stars have very weak x - ray emission even in the pms phase , so this alone does not reveal whether these stars are young or old . to further investigate the origin of these stars we examined their kinematics and compared this field with other fields at the same galactic latitude . the kinematics not only help discriminate between old and young stars ; they also allow us to test the suggestion that the young stars near  formed together as a group , perhaps from a rapidly - moving cloudlet ( feigelson 1996 , kastner   1997 ) .",
    "if the young stars near tw hya were formed in a group from the same molecular cloud , they should have similar space motions . to test this",

    "it is clear that over this amount of time , roughly their estimated ages , the stars were not near each other .",
    "thus it seems unlikely that they formed together .",
    "all of the stars besides , tw hya , and cd @xmath336@xmath47429 have transverse space velocities greater than 10 km s. even ignoring the radial component of their motions , their relative velocities ( table [ table : cands ] and figure [ figure : pm ] ) are much greater than the few km s  velocity dispersion seen for young stars in taurus ( e.g. , jones & herbig 1979 )",
    ". these high velocities are more characteristic of giants than of young stars .",
    "in contrast , cd @xmath336@xmath47429 has a space velocity similar to that of  and tw hya , and it is the brightest x - ray source of the group .",
    "its x - ray brightness and low space velocity suggest that it may well be a   star .",
    "we conclude that most of the stars in table [ table : cands ] are probably not young ( being perhaps mis - classified subgiants or giants , or unresolved triple systems ) , while cd @xmath336@xmath47429 is quite likely a @xmath46-yr - old pms star . as this paper was nearing completion , we obtained spectra of these stars as part of another observing program .",
    "these observations confirm the conclusions above : of the candidate young stars in table [ table : cands ] , only cd @xmath336@xmath47429 has detectable li absorption ; the others all have ew(li ) @xmath5 ",
    ". we will report in detail on these spectroscopic follow - up observations in a later paper , where we shall also present the radial velocities .",
    "is there an excess of young stars near hd 98800 ?",
    "we searched other fields at similar galactic latitudes to find out .",
    "the center of our original search field corresponds to galactic coordinates @xmath158 .",
    "we selected 28 other fields centered at @xmath159 , starting at @xmath160 and separated by increments of @xmath161 ( which gives an angular separation of 214 ) .",
    "thus the edges of these 10-radius fields are separated by roughly 14 and cover most of the sky at @xmath162 .",
    "the only fields excluded were ( 280 , 263 ) , which overlaps our original field , and ( 184,@xmath3263 ) , which includes the hyades .",
    "we applied the same selection criteria used for the original field ( parallax of 15.524.3 mas , parallax uncertainty @xmath163 mas , and presence of a @xmath136 measurement ) to each of these fields .",
    "as before , we rejected stars with luminosity classes i , ii and iii , plotted the remaining stars on the hr diagram , and counted the number of stars in each field that were more than a factor of two above the zams .",
    "first , we simply compared the number of stars meeting our selection criteria without knowledge of whether these stars are pre or post  main - sequence .",
    "the average for 28 fields is 11.4 stars , with a standard deviation of 3.9 , not significantly different than the 11 stars found in our main search field . limiting the comparison to only stars later than g0 ( to match the range of spectral types for t tauri stars ) and eliminating any stars with spectral class iv gives 7.2 @xmath88 3.5 stars per field in the comparison fields , compared with 9 in our main search field , again not a significant difference ; similar results are found for stars k0 and later . even adding , , and  to our main search field sample and comparing against the hipparcos - only sample in other fields gives only a 1@xmath135 excess of stars k0 and later .",
    "comparing the percentages of stars meeting these criteria rather than the absolute numbers does not change the results .",
    "thus , the presence of 11 hipparcos - selected stars above the main sequence in the field near  represents not an unusual excess but rather the norm in a 10-radius field for that galactic latitude and distance .",
    "however , if most of the stars selected in this way are post ",
    "main - sequence stars rather than pre  main - sequence stars ,",
    "as suggested by the x - ray emission and kinematics of the candidates in our main search field , then this comparison does not tell us whether the young - star population near tw hya is unique .",
    "as noted above , , tw hya , and the x - ray bright cd @xmath336@xmath47429 have lower transverse space velocities relative to the lsr than do most of the other stars in their field .",
    "thus , we also compared the number of stars with low transverse space velocities in our main field to that in other fields .",
    "we counted the number of stars in each field that meet our initial selection criteria and also have @xmath164 km s. in our main search field , there are three .",
    "of the other 28 fields , 22 have no candidates with velocities this low , five have one candidate , and one has two candidates .",
    "this gives an average of 0.35 per field ( including our main field ) .",
    "given this average rate , the poisson probability of three or more low velocity stars in a field is 0.005 .",
    "thus , the main search field does have a low - velocity population that is significantly above the mean .",
    "we note that we had no _ a priori _ knowledge of the stars space velocities in choosing this field .",
    "however , we caution that we did not choose the velocity cutoff _ a priori _ though it is physically plausible based on velocity dispersions of known young stars .",
    "if low transverse velocity is a reliable discriminant between old and young stars , as the close relationship between space velocity , x - ray flux , and li shown above suggests , the area around tw hya does indeed seem to have significantly more young stars than other fields at the same distance and galactic latitude .",
    "feigelson ( 1996 ) suggested that the five young stars in the vicinity of  and tw hya might have formed from a rapidly - moving cloudlet that has since dissipated . in this model ,",
    "the young stars might have high space velocities but should have a relatively low velocity dispersion among them .",
    "this hypothesis is ruled out for   and tw hya by the very different direction of their space motions .",
    "two of the young stars , tw hya and cd @xmath336@xmath47429 , apparently were relatively close to each other ( at least in projection ) a few million years ago . without knowing their radial velocities it is difficult to tell how close they were .",
    "however , extrapolating their present motions to their birth epoch of roughly @xmath46 years ago places them far apart .",
    "it is still possible that one or more of the other three stars ( , , and ) shares a common origin with , cd @xmath336@xmath47429 , or tw hya .",
    "in addition , it is likely that more young , late - type stars exist in this area .",
    "the completeness limit of the hipparcos catalog depends on galactic latitude and spectral type ; it is @xmath165 for stars later than g5 and @xmath166 for stars earlier than or equal to g5 at @xmath167 ( turon   1992 ) . even taking the faint end of this completeness limit ( the dashed line in figure [ figure : hr ] ) ,",
    "the hipparcos catalog is seriously incomplete for k and m stars at a distance of 50 pc .",
    "however , until the proper motions of these fainter stars can be measured , there is no evidence that a group of  stars formed together in this area .",
    "this fact , combined with the statistical analysis in the previous section , leads to a puzzling result .",
    "there seems to be an excess of young stars in this area , and yet their space velocities suggest that at least some of them did not form together .",
    "studies of the kinematics of the other young stars in this area may help resolve this apparent paradox .",
    "finally , we note that the apparent excess of young stars in this area from the work of de la reza  ( 1989 ) and gregorio - hetem  ( 1992 ) was discovered partly by chance . neither   nor  meet the original selection criteria ( an _ iras _ detection ) of these studies .",
    "after  was observed spectroscopically , the  source nearby that led to its original selection was found to be associated with a galaxy projected nearby .  was identified later because of its spectroscopic similarity to .",
    "while these two stars are most probably  based on their x - ray properties , there may be many more such sources in areas that have not been surveyed spectroscopically in as much detail .",
    "we have presented pointed  observations of the isolated young stars  and .",
    "their x - ray fluxes and x - ray variability are consistent with them being  stars .",
    "no other  stars were found among x - ray sources within 40  of these stars .",
    "hipparcos observations of the area reveal the presence of nine additional stars that lie above the main sequence in a volume roughly 10 pc in diameter centered on the five previously known young stars .",
    "the x - ray properties and kinematics of these stars indicate that one of them ( cd @xmath336@xmath47429 ) is quite likely a pms star with an age of @xmath46 yr , while the others are more likely post ",
    "main - sequence stars . observations of li abundances in these stars confirm this conclusion",
    ".    comparison with other fields at the same galactic latitude shows that other fields selected in the same way show similar numbers of stars above the main sequence .",
    "however , the field around tw hya has significantly more stars with low space velocities ( less than 5 km s  relative to the lsr ) than the other fields .",
    "thus , there is some indication of an excess of young stars in this area .",
    "nonetheless , the proper motions of , tw hya , and cd @xmath336@xmath47429 , if extrapolated back in time , do not indicate a common place of origin .    * note added in proof : *    our analysis of whether hd 98800 , cd @xmath336@xmath47429 , and tw hya could have formed as a group neglected an important source of uncertainty . the uncertainty in distance to these stars , while it does not affect the observed proper motions , does introduce uncertainty into the solar motion that must be subtracted in order to determine the stars intrinsic proper motions with respect to the lsr .",
    "the 1@xmath135 effect of this uncertainty is shown by the dashed lines in figure 3 . including this uncertainty indicates that tw hya and cd @xmath336@xmath47429 could plausibly have formed together ; only a @xmath168 error on their distances is required . regarding hd 98800 , bringing its current distance @xmath169 closer , to 36.8 pc ,",
    "would allow its projected point of origin to overlap with those of the other two stars .",
    "however , this distance makes hd 98800 a main - sequence star , in conflict with its observed properties and , more importantly , of a very different age than the other two stars . we conclude that hd 98800 is unlikely to share a common origin with tw hya or cd @xmath336@xmath47429",
