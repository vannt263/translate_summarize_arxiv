    "<S> the single layers covered areas of up to 450  @xmath8m^2^ and thus their areas are of the same order of magnitude as the largest chemically exfoliated monolayers known to date@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the height of the @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ single layers was analyzed by afm for the monolayer on the /si substrate and by pxrd for the restacked pellet . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:1 ] e ) shows one exemplary afm image with a height of 1.69(9 )  nm for a @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> it is a common phenomenon that the monolayer height on the substrate differs from the nanosheet terrace height on top of another nanosheet@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the height of a @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ single layer folded onto itself was determined to be 1.06(6 )  nm . </S>",
    "<S> this value is similar to that of chemically exfoliated , where the single layer has a height of 1.0  -  1.2  nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> out - of - plane pxrd measurements of the @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ pellet ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] a ) in reflection geometry yielded a height of d@xmath9  =  1.12  nm , confirming the results from afm . </S>",
    "<S> the small height difference might originate from variations in relative humidity , which recently were shown to have a large influence on the layer height of phosphatoantimonic acid nanosheets @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> though the height of a single layer from pxrd and afm are in agreement , there is still a discrepancy compared to the height of a single layer of the @xmath1- crystal structure ( 0.57  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is most likely due to the presence of residual charge on a single @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ layer , which is indicated by the high zeta potential of -  51.4  mv of the @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the surface charge would attract hydrated counterions , thus increasing the layer height depending on the height by the amount of water surrounding the ions . </S>",
    "<S> after the reductive intercalation , the ratio of ru  :  cl  @xmath10  1  :  3 remains unchanged according to edx . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we assume that the charge injected by resides in the d - bands of ru , leading to a 4d^5+x^ state of in @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^.    the @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ monolayers and pellets were oxidized in a atmosphere to remove the residual layer charge , leading to t- . </S>",
    "<S> the single layer height measured by afm shrank from 1.69(9 )  nm to 1.08(17 )  nm for a nanosheet on the substrate and from 1.06(6 )  nm to 0.72(11 )  nm in the folded monolayer . according to pxrd measurements , the restacked layers in the pellet feature a similar decrease of the stacking distance from 1.12  </S>",
    "<S> nm before to 0.59  nm after oxidation . </S>",
    "<S> the latter value is close to the layer height of 0.57  nm in bulk @xmath1- . </S>",
    "<S> again , the afm and pxrd data are in good agreement with a slightly higher value from afm , possibly due to surface roughness . hence the present interlayer species in @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ were expelled by the oxidative treatment with to yield the oxidized nanosheets and hbr .    since the exfoliation process induces physcial stress and bromine s high oxidative power could potentially damage the sample , the integrity of the in - plane crystal structure was investigated by tem on the @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ single layer as well as pxrd on a multilayer stack of @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ and t- . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:2 ] b ) displays a tem bright field image of a single @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ layer partially folded onto itself on a lacey carbon grid . </S>",
    "<S> the inset features the in - plane ( _ _ hk__0 ) reflections from selected area electron diffraction ( saed ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reflections were assigned by simulationg the diffraction pattern based on the space group _ _ c__2/_m _ of bulk @xmath1- . </S>",
    "<S> figure s1 shows the simulated diffraction pattern . </S>",
    "<S> the _ d_-values of the first five most intense reflections , as listed in table  s4 , coincide with the _ d_-values from the simulation based on the single crystal data within the margin of error in tem . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the in - plane structure is maintained in the exfoliation process .    additionally , pxrd was performed on the pellet of restacked @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ layers and t- in transmission geometry , to check the effect of the treatment on the in - plane structure . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting diffraction patterns are shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] c ) and consist of the ( _ _ hk__0 ) reflections with an intensity tail towards higher angles . </S>",
    "<S> the peak positions and _ d_-values coincide with those of the ( _ _ hk__0 ) reflections of single crystal @xmath1- ( tab . </S>",
    "<S> s4 ) , indicating the retention of the in - plane structure in the @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ pellet , as well as in oxidized t- .    </S>",
    "<S> the diffraction patterns also offer information about the ordering of the layers in the multistack . </S>",
    "<S> a noticable feature is the warren - type peak shape tailing off towards higher angles . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic form originates from the diffraction of the x - ray beam by a lattice with two dimensional translation symmetry without any ordering in the third dimension @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the peak shape is the first indicator for the absence of order in the third dimension , signifying turbostratic disorder . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion can be drawn from the out - of - plane pxrd , where the pellets of @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ and t- feature an exponential intensity decay for the series of ( 00__l _ _ ) reflections with higher order . </S>",
    "<S> this is known from tetrabutylammonium ( tba ) intercalated , swollen lamellar phases such as , and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( 00__l _ _ ) reflections of the ordered bulk @xmath1- features a different intensity distribution , which is displayed in figure s2 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the presence of turbostratic disorder is suggested by the in- and out - of - plane pxrd patterns .    </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of turbostratic disorder and the changes in the oxidation state are expected to affect the magnetic properties of the different compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this is reflected in the in - plane ( ip ) and out - of - plane ( op ) investigations of the magnetic properties of @xmath1- and as well as of the pellets of @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ and t- . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of magnetic transitions , the weiss temperature and the magnetic moment were used as a measure for the cooperative character of the magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic susceptibilities of t- and @xmath1- are presented in figure [ fig:3 ] , while the data for and @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ is featured in the supporting information . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:4 ] summarizes the results of curie - weiss fits for all compounds .    in bulk @xmath1- , we observe two magnetic transitions at  =  7  k and  =  13  k for the in - plane measurements , which were determined from the dmt / dt plot displayed in the supporting information and are consistent with previous experiments@xcite . the weiss temperatures @xmath11 of 31.2 ( 3 ) k and @xmath12 of -  137.7(5 )  </S>",
    "<S> k suggest an in - plane fm exchange and out - of - plane af interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these results are comparable to previous studies , where the values range from @xmath11  =  37  k to 68  k and @xmath12  =  -  145  k to -  150  k@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effective magnetic moment @xmath13  =  2.26(1 )  @xmath14  /  ru and @xmath15  =  2.22(1 )  @xmath14  /  ru are also in the range of previously reported values ( @xmath13  =  2.0  -  2.14  @xmath14  /  ru and @xmath15  =  2.3  -  2.7  @xmath14  /  ru@xcite ) and are much higher than the spin - only value of 1.75  @xmath14  /  ru , thereby indicating the presence of soc@xcite .    upon the reductive intercalation of lithium ions into the interlayer space , the 4d^5^ electron configuration of ru^3+^ changes to a 4d^6^ state with s  =  0 for roughly 20  % of the ru centers in . </S>",
    "<S> this is abbreviated as `` 4d^5.2^ '' in figure [ fig:4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the disturbance of the spin  @xmath0 order leads to paramagnetic behavior , which is associated with a decaying magnetic susceptibility with increasing temperature without any magnetic transition in the in- and out - of - plane direction . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of the in - plane ( @xmath11  =  0.6(2 )  k , @xmath13  =  1.08(2 )  @xmath14  /  ru ) as well as out - of - plane weiss temperatures and magnetic moments ( @xmath12  =  17.8(3 )  k , @xmath15  =  1.58(1 )  @xmath14  /  ru ) also reflects this trend . </S>",
    "<S> this suggest that the cooperative magnetism of @xmath1- has been disturbed by electron injection into the -layers . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a similar change in magnetism has been reported in , where holes were injected into the @xmath5@xmath6$]^@xmath16^ layer by oxidation with . there , the low spin electron configuration changes from 5d^5^ to 5d^4^ with s  =  0 due to soc , inducing paramagnetic behavior@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic data of the restacked pellet of @xmath5@xmath6$]^x-^ measured within the plane exhibits a similarly decaying magnetization curve without any features , similar to the paramagnetic behavior of . </S>",
    "<S> although the weiss temperatures indicate slightly antiferromagnetic behavior ( @xmath11  =  -  13.5(7 )  k and @xmath12  =  -  13.5(3 )  k ) , no magnetic transitions were observed in the out - of - plane direction and only a slight shoulder is visible in the in - plane direction . </S>",

    "<S> is reflected by a transition in the in - plane data of the magnetic susceptibility at t@xmath2  =  7  k. also , it is accompanied by an increase of the weiss temperature as well as the effective magnetic moment to @xmath11  =  17.8(7 )  k and @xmath13  =  2.33(1 )  @xmath14  /  ru respectively , values similar to those found in the in - plane data of @xmath1- ( @xmath11  =  31.2  ( 3 )  k ; @xmath13  =  2.26(1 )  @xmath14  /  ru ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the out - of - plane measurement is characterized by paramagnetic behavior with a decaying magnetic susceptibility towards higher temperatures </S>",
    "<S> . the out - of - plane weiss temperature @xmath12  =  2(2 )  k also indicates paramagnetic behavior , similar to the low effective magnetic moment @xmath15  =  1.27(1 )  @xmath14  /  ru , which is much closer to the value found in the paramagnetic ( @xmath15  =  1.58(1 )  @xmath14  /  ru ) than the one found in @xmath1- ( @xmath15  =  2.22(1 )  @xmath14  /  ru ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the return of cooperative magnetism at t@xmath2  =  7  k as well as the changes in the weiss temperature and magnetic moment suggest a restoration of the magnetic order based on the 4d^5^ electron configuration . however , in contrast to the bulk we observe only one magnetic transition in the in - plane direction . </S>",
    "<S> another difference compared to bulk @xmath1- is the paramagnetic behavior of the out - of - plane data , with the weiss temperature and the effective magnetic moment being more similar to the paramagnetic .    </S>",
    "<S> to explain this behavior , the turbostratic disorder , as observed in the in- and out - of - plane pxrd data , has to be considered next to the electron configuration . </S>",
    "<S> since the symmetry relation between the in - plane and the stacking direction is lifted by turbostratic disorder , no long range magnetic order can be expected outside the t- single layer . </S>",
    "<S> this could be interpreted as a structural decoupling of the nanosheets , thereby possibly weakening the magnetic interlayer interactions , which probably also affects the in - plane magnetism . therefore , even though macroscopic pellets of layers were investigated , the results seem representative for the behavior of single layers of . figure [ fig:5 ] </S>",
    "<S> gives an overview of the electronic and structural differences between the presented compounds .    even though the exact in - plane spin structure of t- is yet unknown , the combination of the 4d^5^ electron configuration , the retention of the ru honeycomb arrangement as well as the magnetic transition at the same temperature as the zigzag order in bulk @xmath1- hint towards the restoration of the magnetic order in t- , with the zigzag structure being one possible candidate . </S>",
    "<S> further investigations , especially neutron diffraction experiments , are of great interest to elucidate the spin structure of t- in the single layer or restacked form .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we presented a synthetic route towards nanosheets , the first exfoliation of a binary halide . </S>",
    "<S> investigations of its in - plane structure show that it was retained during the exfoliation process , leading to dispersed , charged [ ] ^x-^ monolayers in suspension . </S>",
    "<S> deposition of the sheets is possible and is used to create a pellet with turbostratic disorder . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic measurements show that the intermediary pellet is a paramagnet . upon oxidizing the pellet , the long range magnetic order of the spin  @xmath0 honeycomb arrangement </S>",
    "<S> is reestablished within the plane . </S>",
    "<S> a very different weiss temperature and effective magnetic moment were observed in the out - of - plane direction compared to bulk @xmath1- , probably due to turbostratic disorder . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the pellet of t- seems to behave like a stack of magnetically decoupled single layers which can be obtained and characterized in bulk form . to our knowledge , a top - down approach of exfoliation and restacking of nanosheets to deliberately introduce turbostratic disorder enabling the manipulation of the magnetic properties of a solid has not been reported yet . </S>",
