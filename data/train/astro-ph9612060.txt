    "determinations of the outer rotation curves of galaxies have revealed one of the most remarkable discoveries ever made in astronomy : that the great majority of the mass of a typical galaxy lies outside the luminous body of the galaxy .",
    "since we can explore our own galaxy in details that are likely never to be accessible in external galaxies , it is important to determine whether it conforms to this pattern .",
    "observational data that bear on this question have been analyzed many times over the last decade ( e.g. , fich & tremaine 1991 ; merrifield 1992 ; brand & blitz 1993 ) .",
    "[ bbfig ] shows a typical plot of @xmath0 for the galaxy  this example is from the study of brand & blitz ( 1993 ) .",
    "two striking features of the plot are ( i ) the abrupt increase in the scatter of the points and the size of the error bars on them as one passes from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , and ( ii ) the clear suggestion that @xmath1 is rising linearly with @xmath2 at @xmath8 although it is , if anything , falling with @xmath2 at @xmath9 . that this change in the structure of the circular - speed curve occurs precisely where there is a change in the technique used to measure it , is surely a highly suspicious circumstance .    in this note",
    "we argue that the data are naturally explained by supposing that the observed tracers of @xmath1 are concentrated into one or two aproximately circular rings . in this case distance errors cause the derived circular - speed curve to rise linearly with radius irrespective of the shape of the true form of @xmath0 .    in section 2",
    "we explain why noisy measurements of tracers that are concentrated into a ring will simulate solid - body rotation . in section 3",
    "we show that the exsting data may be successfully modelled by a ring .",
    "section 4 sums up .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath10 .",
    "one estimates @xmath0 at @xmath8 by ( i ) estimating the distance @xmath11 to some object that is thought to be on a nearly circular orbit , and then ( ii ) determining the line - of - sight velocity of this object with respect to the local standard of rest , @xmath12 .",
    "the galactocentric distance @xmath2 of the object can be determined from @xmath11 and the object s coordinates @xmath13 on the sky , and then the circular frequency @xmath14 at @xmath2 is constrained by the formula [ defsw ] w(r)=r_0((r)-(r_0 ) ) .",
    "this formula makes it clear that what one actually measures is the difference = ( r)(r)-(r_0 ) between the circular frequencies at the sun and the location of the tracer .",
    "an error in the tracer s distance causes this difference to be associated with the wrong radius . in particular ,",
    "if all tracers were really at a single radius @xmath15 , the scatter in the derived values of @xmath2 would lead one to assign the same value of @xmath16 to a range of values of @xmath2 , and the outer galaxy would appear to be in rigid - body rotation , just as fig .",
    "[ bbfig ] sugests .    the biasing effect of errors is obscured in fig .  [ bbfig ] because the plotted errors are highly correlated . fig .",
    "[ bb2fig ] shows the same data but with the effects of errors in @xmath17 and in @xmath11 shown independently .",
    "the tendency of errors to suggest solid - body rotation is now apparent .",
    "[ wrfig ] shows 99 determinations from brand & blitz of the quantity @xmath18 that is defined by equation ( [ defsw ] ) .",
    "tracers at @xmath7 that have @xmath19 , lie closer than @xmath20 to the anticentre direction , or nearer than @xmath21 to the sun have been excluded since the line - of - sight velocities of such objects are liable to be dominated by peculiar motion .",
    "[ wrfig ] suggests that @xmath14 drops steeply between @xmath22 and @xmath23 and is then approximately constant out to @xmath24 .",
    "it is this constancy of @xmath14 which gives the impression of a strongly rising circular - speed curve in fig .",
    "[ bbfig ] .",
    "in view of the inherent implausibility of the result @xmath25 at @xmath8 we now investigate the possibility that many tracers yield @xmath26 because they lie in a ring . specifically , we derive for @xmath27 the probability of measuring some ( @xmath28 ) from objects that actually all lie on a ring at @xmath29 with @xmath30 ( these values of @xmath1 are from model 2 of dehnen & binney 1997 ) .",
    "we assume that the observational errors are normally distributed in @xmath31 and @xmath12  that is , the probability of measuring ( @xmath32 ) at given longitude @xmath33 is taken to be [ pringl ] p = ^-12(x^2+y^2 ) 2d d _ with [ xy ] x , y. here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the line - of - sight velocity of and distance to the ring at the longitude @xmath33 of a given tracer , @xmath36 is the relative error in the distance to the tracer and @xmath37 is the uncertainty in the ring s velocity at its location  this contains contributions from both measurement errors and the velocity dispersion of tracers within the ring .",
    "the probability density @xmath38 to measure @xmath39 is then given by ( [ pringl ] ) multiplied by the jacobian @xmath40 and convolved with an appropriate @xmath33-distribution for the tracers .",
    "we obtain the latter by assuming that the tracers are uniformly distributed around the ring in quadrants ii and iii , with objects that lie within @xmath20 of the anticentre direction excluded , as in fig .",
    "[ wrfig ] . from the outside inwards ,",
    "[ pring ] shows the 99 , 90 , 68.3 , 30 and 10 percent confidence contours of @xmath38 given that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these contours may be compared with the distribution of points in fig .",
    "[ bbfig ] .",
    "it is interesting to quantify further the plausibility of the ring hypothesis .",
    "this may be conveniently done by considering the distribution of observed points in @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( equation [ xy ] ) for a ring at @xmath45 . in calculating this distribution",
    "we have modified the cited observational errors as follows : ( i ) we have quadratically added a dispersion of 10  to the cited velocity errors ; ( ii ) we have placed a lower limit @xmath46 on every distance error . for tracers in a ring the distribution in the @xmath47 plane is given by ( [ pringl ] ) , which is constant on circles in the @xmath47 plane that are centred on @xmath48 .",
    "quantitatively , the probability that a tracer lies within distance @xmath49 of the origin is @xmath50 .",
    "hence if the ring model is correct , tracers that lie within the ring will be uniformly distributed in both @xmath51 and @xmath52 . by contrast , tracers that lie outside the ring will clump in the @xmath51-@xmath53 plane .",
    "[ ksfig ] shows a plausible division of points between the ring and the disk near the sun .",
    "specifically the left - hand panel shows the data points of fig .",
    "[ wrfig ] divided into ( i ) those associated with the disk near the sun or at @xmath54 ( open symbols ) and ( ii ) those associated with the ring ( filled symbols ) .",
    "the open symbols appear to be compatible with the curve @xmath18 from model 2 of dehnen & binney ( 1997 ) , which is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ ksfig ] .",
    "the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ ksfig ] shows that the filled symbols are compatible with the ring hypothesis , by demonstrating that within the @xmath51-@xmath53 plane these points are reasonably uniformly distributed .",
    "quantitatively , one finds that the kolmogorov - smirnov probability that the points are uniformly distributed in @xmath51 is @xmath55 , while the corresponding probability for the @xmath53 distribution is @xmath56 , whereas the correlation coefficient between the two is @xmath57 .",
    "using monte carlo simulations we estimated that for a uniform distribution @xmath58 with a probability of 0.48 .",
    "the circular - speed curve that one derives from a simple plot of observationally estimated values of @xmath1 against @xmath2 is highly implausible for two reasons .",
    "first , it abruptly reverses the sign of its derivative at @xmath22 , where there is a change in the way @xmath1 is measured .",
    "second , at @xmath8 the galaxy appears to be rotating rigidly , which would require the galactic mass - density to be independent of radius at @xmath3 .",
    "we have explored the possibility that the apparent rigid rotation of the outer galaxy is an artifact that arises because most tracers at @xmath5 are concentrated into a ring .",
    "if there is such a concentration of tracers , distance errors will give the erroneous result @xmath59 because what one actually measures is @xmath16 , the difference between the angular velocity of a tracer and that of the sun : everything in a ring will yield the same value of @xmath16 , and distance errors will distribute these values in @xmath2 .",
    "a simple simulation of the effects of distance and velocity errors shows that the existing data are compatible with a gently declining circular - speed curve at @xmath8 provided most tracers at @xmath60 lie in a ring of radius @xmath61 ."
