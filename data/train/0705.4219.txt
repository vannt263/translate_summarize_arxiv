    "supersymmetry ( susy ) at the tev scale remains an attractive possibility for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "susy helps in the unification of couplings in grand unified theories ( guts ) , and provides a resolution of some aspects of the hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) may be a neutralino consisting of a linear combination of bino , wino and neutral higgsinos , providing a consistent wimp dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "for example the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with conserved r - parity provides such an lsp with a mass of order the electroweak scale .",
    "although general arguments suggest that such a particle should provide a good dark matter candidate @xcite , the successful regions of parameter space allowed by wmap and collider constraints are now tightly restricted @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such a restricted parameter space has lead to recent claims that supersymmetry must be fine - tuned to fit the observed dark matter relic density @xcite .",
    "this is a serious concern for supersymmetry , especially as much of the motivation for supersymmetry arises from fine - tuning arguments in the form of its solution to the hierarchy problem . in previous work",
    "@xcite-@xcite we quantitatively studied the fine - tuning cost of the primary dark matter regions within the mssm .",
    "it was found that the majority of dark matter regions did indeed require some degree of fine - tuning , and that this fine - tuning could be directly related to the mechanism responsible for the annihilation of susy matter in the early universe that defined each region .",
    "the one region that exhibited no fine - tuning at all was the ` bulk region ' in which the dominant annihilation mechanism is via t - channel slepton exchange .",
    "this region can be accessed in models in which the gauginos have non - universal soft masses at the gut scale @xcite .",
    "these results motivate a more careful study of models that give rise to non - universal gaugino masses . in our previous work such a region",
    "was accessed by allowing all the gaugino masses to vary independently .",
    "such an approach is very unconstrained .",
    "we would expect the gaugino masses to arise from a deeper theory such as string constructions , as studied in @xcite , @xcite or in gut models  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "both approaches generally impose specific relations between the gaugino masses at the gut scale . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss non - universal gaugino masses in a more general way than previously , allowing for different relative signs of gaugino masses , focusing on @xmath0 guts as an example , although it is clear that similar effects can be achieved in other guts such as @xmath10 or pati - salam .",
    "we shall show how the bulk region may be readily accessed in such models providing that the susy breaking sector arises from a combination of an @xmath0 singlet 1 , together with an admixture of one of the 24 , 75 or 200 representations of @xmath0 .",
    "we will also show that in all cases the fine - tuning required to access such a region remains small .",
    "the rest of the paper is set out as follows .",
    "first we review our methodology in section [ sec : methods ] . in section",
    "[ sec : su(5 ) ] we review the structure of gaugino non - universality in @xmath0 . in section [ sec:24 ]",
    "we consider the specific case where all of the gaugino masses arise from a 24 of @xmath0 . in section [ sec : admixtures ] we generalise this to the case where the masses arise from an admixture of the singlet representation and one of the 24 , 75 or 200 . in section [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the gut structure of the theory is a structure that is imposed on the soft susy breaking masses at the gut scale , @xmath11  gev . to study the low energy phenomenology of such a model we need to run the mass spectrum down to the electroweak scale . to do this we use the rge code softsusy @xcite .",
    "this interfaces with the mssm package within micromegas @xcite .",
    "we use this to calculate the dark matter relic density @xmath12 , as well as @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ".      not all choices of parameters are equal . after running the mass spectrum of the model point from the gut scale to the electroweak scale",
    "we perform a number of checks .",
    "a point is ruled out if it :    1 .",
    "does nt provide radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) .",
    "2 .   violates mass bounds on particles from the tevatron and lep2 .",
    "3 .   results in a lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) that is not the lightest neutralino .    in the remaining parameter space",
    "we plot regions that fit @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "present measurements of the value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath17 deviate from the theoretical calculation of the sm value data , or the @xmath18 .",
    "the weight of evidence indicates the @xmath19 data is more reliable and we use this in our work . ] . taking the current experimental world average , and state of the art standard model value from @xcite",
    "there is a discrepancy : @xmath20 which amounts to a 3.4@xmath21 deviation from the standard model value .",
    "the variation of @xmath13 from the value predicted by the standard model is highly sensitive to susy contributions arising from charged higgs - top loops and chargino - stop loops . to date",
    "no deviation from the standard model has been detected .",
    "we take the current world average from @xcite of the belle @xcite , cleo @xcite and babar @xcite experiments : @xmath22      evidence from the cmb and rotation curves of galaxies both point to a large amount of cold non - baryonic dark matter in the universe .",
    "the present measurements @xcite place the dark matter density at : @xmath23    for any point that lies within the @xmath16 allowed region we calculate the fine - tuning and plot the resulting colour - coded point .      as in @xcite we follow ellis and olive @xcite in quantifying the fine - tuning price of fitting dark matter with the measure : @xmath24 where we take the total fine - tuning of a point to be equal to the largest individual tuning , @xmath25 .",
    "in the non - universal @xmath0 model @xcite , in addition to the singlet f - term susy breaking , the gauge kinetic function can also depend on a non - singlet chiral superfield @xmath26 , whose auxiliary @xmath27-component acquires a large vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "in general the gaugino masses come from the following dimension five term in the lagrangian : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 gaugino fields i.e. the bino @xmath33 , the wino @xmath34 and the gluino @xmath35 respectively .",
    "since the gauginos belong to the adjoint representation of @xmath0 , @xmath26 and @xmath36 can belong to any of the irreducible representations appearing in their symmetric product , i.e. @xmath37 the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) model assumes @xmath26 to be a singlet , which implies equal gaugino masses at the gut scale . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath26 belongs to one of the non - singlet representations of @xmath0 , then these gaugino masses are unequal but related to one another via the representation invariants .",
    "thus the three gaugino masses at the gut scale in a given representation @xmath38 are determined in terms of a single susy breaking mass parameter @xmath39 by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ". the resulting ratios of @xmath45 s for each @xmath38 are listed in table  [ tabrelativeweights ] .",
    ".relative values of the su(3 ) , su(2 ) and u(1 ) gaugino masses at gut scale for different representations @xmath38 of the chiral superfield @xmath26 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the hierarchy of the weak scale susy spectrum is fairly stable for all the points shown in fig  [ fig : admixtures ] . table  [ tab : spectrum ] lists the neutralino , chargino and sfermion masses along with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath48 for the point b5 as an example .",
    "in contrast to the cmssm the bino is lighter than the wino by a factor of 6 .",
    "correspondingly the right and left slepton masses are split by a large factor .",
    "the small value of @xmath49 also ensures that the right handed sleptons are considerably lighter than the wino .",
    "hence a large fraction of wino decay is predicted to proceed via @xmath50 , resulting in one or more tau leptons in the final state in addition to the missing-@xmath51 . though the light selectron and smuon have negligible left - handed components , and",
    "so can not take part in the wino decay , the heavier selectron and smuon are still lighter than the wino in all points we consider . a wino decay via a left - handed selectron / smuon would give a distinctive signal in the form of hard electron(s)/muon(s ) in addition to the missing-@xmath51 .",
    "thus one expects a distinctive susy signal from squark / gluino cascade decays at lhc containing hard isolated leptons in addition to the missing-@xmath51 and jets .",
    "in previous work we found that a model with non - universal gaugino masses could access the bulk region in which t - channel slepton exchange alone could account for the observed dark matter relic density .",
    "the bulk region is an attractive prospect as it allows susy to account for the observed dark matter relic density without any appreciable fine - tuning .",
    "however , a model with entirely free gaugino masses is very unconstrained . such non - universality must arise from a deeper structure and such structures",
    "should impose restrictions on the precise form of the gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "in this paper we have considered neutralino dark matter within the framework of susy guts with non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "we have taken the specific case of an @xmath0 gut model where the gaugino masses arise from different irreducible representations of the symmetric product of the adjoint representations .",
    "in particular we focused on the case of @xmath0 with a susy breaking f - term in the 1 , 24 , 75 and 200 dimensional representations .",
    "we discussed the 24 case in some detail , and showed that the bulk dark matter region can not be accessed in this case . in general",
    "if we just take the simplest case in which the gaugino masses arise from only one representation , we find that as far as achieving the bulk region is concerned , there is no advantage over the cmssm .",
    "this is in part due to the surprising result that the sign and magnitude of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath2 has an important effect on the lightest higgs mass through its effect on the top trilinear .",
    "we then went on to consider the case of the singlet susy breaking f - term combined with an admixture of one of the 24 , 75 or 200 dimensional f - terms .",
    "such a scenario is natural once we allow the higher dimensional representations in our theory . in all these cases we showed that it becomes possible to access the bulk regions corresponding to low fine - tuned dark matter .",
    "in addition , the degree of fine - tuning required to access the bulk region remains small in the gut models .",
    "therefore we conclude that such models can access the bulk region and naturally account for the observed dark matter relic density .",
    "finally we note that the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : admixtures ] are presented in the @xmath1 plane for fixed @xmath2 and so are useful for considering general gut models , as well as more general non - universal gaugino models .",
    "the hierarchy of weak scale susy spectrum is fairly stable for all the points shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : admixtures ] .",
    "both the right and left sleptons are lighter than the wino , implying a large leptonic br of wino decay .",
    "this promises a distinctive susy signal from squark / gluino cascade decays at lhc in the form of hard isolated leptons in addition to the missing-@xmath51 and jets .",
