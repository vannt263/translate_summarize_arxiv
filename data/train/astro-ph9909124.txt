    "understanding the large scale structure of our universe is the ultimate goal of observational cosmology .",
    "currently , sloan digital sky survey and two - degree field survey are working and the enormous observational data will be obtained . in the next generation of deep galaxy surveys , the formation and the evolution of galaxy distribution will be measured more precisely .",
    "it provides us with the powerful constraint on the theory of structure formation in the universe .",
    "when we compare the theoretical prediction for the density fluctuations with the observation of galaxy sky survey , however , the relation between the total mass and the galaxies must be clarified .",
    "since we do not yet have any reliable theory of galaxy / star formation history , there exists the statistical uncertainty between the galaxies and the total mass , which must be determined from the observational data .",
    "this uncertainty hampers the effort to obtain the cosmological information such as the density parameter ( @xcite ) .    provided the fluctuations of the total mass @xmath0 and the distribution of the galaxy number density @xmath1 , the relation @xmath2 is often quoted in the literature .",
    "however , the galaxy biasing in nature could be non - linear and the simple linear relation ( [ linear - bias ] ) might not be appropriate ( @xcite ) . fry ( 1994 ) and gaztaaga & frieman ( 1994 ) compared the observational data with a straightforward extension of ( [ linear - bias ] ) given by @xmath3 the assumption ( [ nl - bias ] ) still restricts the statistical feature of the galaxy distribution . in general , the relation between the galaxies and the total mass may be time dependent and stochastic ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a more general framework to treat this situation is needed , referred to as the stochastic biasing .    using the different catalogs or subsamples of the galaxy surveys , the observational evidence of stochasticity has been recently discussed ( @xcite , @xcite ) . as for the theoretical study , dekel & lahav ( 1999 ) has proposed the general formalism for non - linear stochastic biasing .",
    "pen ( 1998 ) discussed an observational method to determine the stochasticity .",
    "further , blanton _",
    "et al_. ( 1998 ) and blanton , cen & tegmark ( 1999 ) performed the cosmological simulation of galaxy formation and demonstrated that the stochastic property of the biasing could evolve due to the galaxy formation process . since we still lack our knowledge of the non - linear aspect of the stochastic biasing , the qualitative features should deserve consideration .    in this paper",
    ", we analytically investigate the dynamical feature of the non - linear stochastic biasing .",
    "we study the time evolution induced by gravity , which would be one of the most important sources of non - linearity .",
    "the observational study of the galaxy clustering recently shows that the evolution model induced by gravity is sufficient to explain the observed galaxy distribution at redshift @xmath4 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the gravitational evolution of biasing would play a crucial role in the data analyses of future deep sky surveys .",
    "the previous discussion about the time evolution of stochastic biasing has been concentrated on the tree - level analysis , i.e , based on the lowest order perturbation .",
    "tegmark & peebles ( 1999 ) examined the linear evolution .",
    "taruya , koyama & soda ( 1999 ) has extended the pioneering work of fry ( 1996 ) and investigated the skewness and the bi - spectrum .",
    "taruya & soda ( 1999 ) further study the weakly non - linear galaxy - mass density relation .",
    "this paper focuses on the next - to - leading order of non - linearity .",
    "we take into account the one - loop correction of non - linear gravity , corresponding to the one - loop diagram in the graphical representation of perturbation theory ( @xcite , 1996b ) .",
    "then , we shall investigate the power spectrum , the second order statistics of density perturbations in the fourier space .",
    "the power spectrum of the total mass distribution has been extensively investigated by several authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis is further extended to the power spectrum of galaxies and the cross correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "define the vector @xmath5 in the fourier space , we have the three kinds of power spectrum @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the power spectrum of the total mass , galaxies and the cross correlation between them .",
    "the statistical feature of the galaxy biasing is encoded in the power spectra @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which can be quantified by comparing them with the power spectrum of the total mass distribution .",
    "we will analyze the biasing parameter @xmath10 and the correlation coefficient @xmath11 : @xmath12 which are frequently used in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the simple biasing prescription ( [ linear - bias ] ) restricts the above parameter @xmath13 .",
    "we organize the paper as follows ; in section [ sec : formalism ] , we briefly mention the basic formalism for the time evolution of stochastic biasing .",
    "the evolution equations ( eqs.[[basic - eq1]][[basic - eq2 ] ] [ [ basic - eq - gal ] ] ) and the initial conditions ( eqs.[[init - condition]][[init - g ] ] ) are presented .",
    "section [ sec : evolution ] is devoted to the weakly non - linear analysis .",
    "we compute the one - loop correction of the power spectra and the time evolution of the stochastic biasing is investigated in detail .",
    "our main results are described in section [ subsec : time evolution ] .",
    "we specifically pay attention to the effect of the non - linear biasing ( sec.[subsubsec : linear ] ) and the non - linear gravity ( sec.[subsubsec : quasi - linear ] ) .",
    "the conclusions and discussion are summarized in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "recall the definition of the density field @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath14 where the variables with overbars denote the homogeneous averaged quantity .",
    "the gravitational evolution of the galaxy biasing has been studied by fry ( 1996 ) , tegmark & peebles ( 1998 ) and taruya , koyama & soda ( 1999 ) . in these papers ,",
    "the distribution @xmath0 follows the equation of continuity and the euler equation . on the other hand , neglecting the merging and the galaxy formation process , the galaxies are regarded as the test particles in the dark matter distribution @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the distribution @xmath1 should satisfy the equation of continuity whose velocity field is determined by the gravitational potential . on large scales ,",
    "the assumption of the irrotational velocity flow is valid .",
    "we define the velocity divergence @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath17 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the evolution equations for the total mass and the galaxies become @xmath18 @xmath19 the variable @xmath20 is the cosmological constant and @xmath21 is the density parameter defined by @xmath22 equations ( [ basic - eq1 ] ) , ( [ basic - eq2 ] ) and ( [ basic - eq - gal ] ) are our basic equations for the time evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these equations can be solved systematically using the perturbation theory if we give the initial conditions @xmath23 at an early time @xmath24 order by order .",
    "to linear order , provided the initial distributions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given in terms of the independent random fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the solutions become @xmath27 since we are interested in the leading behavior of the time evolution , the solutions are only taken into account the growing mode of perturbation denoted as @xmath28 .",
    "the function @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29 with the initial condition @xmath30 .",
    "note that the random fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 assign the statistical feature of the galaxies and the total mass . on large scales , the linear perturbation for the fluctuations",
    "@xmath33 may be valid and the central limit theorem implies that the spatial distribution could be well - approximated by the gaussian statistics .",
    "hence , the variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 are assumed to be the gaussian random fields .    the full evolution is non - linear , including the higher order perturbative solutions .",
    "regarding the spatial variables @xmath34 as the seeds of perturbation , the general form of the @xmath35-th order solutions becomes the terms collecting the time dependent function multiplied by the spatial random variables @xmath36^n$ ] .",
    "here , we give the initial distributions @xmath37 as the taylor expansion of the functions ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath38 based on the ansatz ( [ init - condition ] ) , we will consider the time evolution emanating from the local biasing .",
    "their functional forms are determined as follows ; since the total mass fluctuation is produced during the very early stage of the universe , the gravitational instability induces the deviation from the initial gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , we give the initial condition of the total mass @xmath39 iteratively from the perturbative solution by dropping the decaying mode . as for the galaxies , the initial distribution @xmath1 is induced by the galaxy formation .",
    "currently , it is not feasible to know the initial non - gaussian distribution @xmath40 .",
    "we treat @xmath41 as a parametrized function , @xmath42 neglecting the higher order terms , ( [ init - g ] ) gives the same initial condition as in the linear order solution @xmath43 .",
    "notice that the resulting expression for the total mass @xmath0 leads to the non - local and non - gaussian distribution ( see eqs.[[2nd - sol - m]][[3rd - sol - m ] ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we simply assume that the function @xmath40 is locally characterized by the constant parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which have to do with the initial skewness and initial kurtosis .",
    "we should remark that the locality of the galaxy distribution only holds at the initial time .",
    "due to the gravity , the distribution @xmath1 can become non - local , which can yield the scale - dependence of the galaxy biasing ( sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : quasi - linear ] , see also @xcite ) .",
    "once we obtain the perturbative solutions @xmath37 , we can investigate the statistical features for the density fluctuations by taking the ensemble average @xmath46 . in our prescription ,",
    "the ensemble average is taken with respect to the gaussian random fields @xmath34 .",
    "their stochasticity is completely characterized by the three quantities . defining the two - dimensional vector @xmath47 in the fourier space",
    ", we have @xmath48 where the quantity @xmath49 is the initial power spectrum of the total mass .",
    "the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 are assumed to be the scale - independent variables , for simplicity .",
    "now , the formalism developed here enables us to obtain the weakly non - linear power spectra ( [ spectra ] ) . before closing this section",
    ", we present the linear order results . using the relation ( [ initial - spectra ] ) , the three kinds of the power spectra are obtained by substituting the fourier transform of the linear solutions ( [ linear - sol ] ) into the definition ( [ spectra ] ) . denoting the linear spectrum as @xmath52 , we have @xmath53 thus , the biasing parameter @xmath10 and the correlation coefficient @xmath11 can be evaluated from ( [ def - of - b - r2 ] ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath54 where the superscript @xmath55 means the linear order quantity .",
    "the variables @xmath56 and @xmath57 are scale - independent and their initial values correspond to the parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "note that fry ( 1996 ) has obtained the same result in the specific case @xmath58 . in this case",
    ", we immediately obtain @xmath59 and the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 reduces to the deterministic biasing ( [ linear - bias ] ) .",
    "thus , in our prescription of the time evolution , the stochasticity in the galaxy biasing comes from the initial condition @xmath60 .",
    "in this section , we develop the higher order perturbations and investigate the time evolution of galaxy biasing . in section [ subsec : 1-loop ] , the one - loop correction of power spectra is computed . after describing the qualitative feature of the galaxy biasing in the weakly non - linear regime , the time evolution",
    "is examined in section [ subsec : time evolution ] .",
    "when we take into account the next - to - leading order terms , the power spectrum can be written as @xmath61+\\cdots .",
    "\\label{weakly - ps}\\ ] ] the terms in the bracket are the one - loop correction , which can be evaluated using the second and third order solutions of perturbations @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the details of calculation and the resulting expressions for the one - loop spectra @xmath62 and @xmath63 are comprehensively described in appendix . here , we discuss the technical issue to implement the numerical integration .",
    "the expressions for the spectra ( [ pm22])-([pcross13 ] ) have the three - dimensional integral for the linear power spectra @xmath49 .",
    "the further reduction enables us to obtain the expressions including the two - dimensional integral over @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the @xmath62 part , while the @xmath63 part has the one - dimensional integral over @xmath65 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the care is required for evaluation of these integrals . for the single power - law spectrum @xmath66 with @xmath67 ,",
    "the infrared divergence appears at each integral .",
    "as for the total mass @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which have been studied by several authors , the limit @xmath70 yields @xmath71 which imply that the infrared divergences occur at @xmath67 .",
    "it is known that this is apparent and the divergences cancel out when we evaluate the total contribution of the power spectrum @xmath7 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . however , in cases of the power spectra @xmath72 and @xmath9 , the infrared divergences still remain even if we compute the total contribution .",
    "the physical interpretation of the infrared divergence in cases with the single power - law spectrum @xmath49 is difficult .",
    "in reality , however , the infrared divergence does not appear if we adopt the phenomenological spectrum such as the cold dark matter ( cdm ) power spectrum by bardeen _",
    "( 1986 ) , where the effective spectral index @xmath73 becomes positive in the limit @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the particular behavior in the single power - law spectrum might not affect the real universe .    on the other hand , depending on the shape of the power spectrum @xmath49 , the ultraviolet divergence ( @xmath75 ) appears even in the total mass @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the integrand from the high frequency part can give the large contribution to the total power spectra and the care is also required to proceed the weakly non - linear analysis self - consistently .",
    "thus , the high - frequency cutoff @xmath76 should be introduced when we evaluate the integrals .",
    "if we have the power spectrum @xmath49 as defined with the interval @xmath77 , the integral over @xmath65 and @xmath64 for the @xmath62 part and over @xmath65 for the @xmath63 part should be replaced : @xmath78 the cutoff @xmath79 is auxiliary introduced so that the numerical integration can converge rapidly . as long as the power spectrum @xmath49 has the effective index @xmath80 in the limit @xmath74 , the influence of the cutoff @xmath79 does not affect the weakly non - linear power spectra .",
    "the qualitative features of the one - loop power spectra should be mentioned before analyzing the time evolution .",
    "several authors have discussed the influence of non - linear biasing to the two - point correlation function ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the remarkable features appearing in the spectrum of galaxies are summarized as follows :    ( i ) : :    constant power on very large scales , ( ii ) : :    over a wide range of scales , the non - vanishing parameters    @xmath44 and @xmath45 modify the biasing parameter    @xmath10 predicted in linear theory .    the effect ( i )",
    "comes from the @xmath81 part of the power spectra . from ( [ pg22 ] ) , the initial one - loop spectrum @xmath82 becomes @xmath83 for the typical linear spectrum @xmath49 satisfying the limit @xmath84 as @xmath74 , the above integral becomes constant and it eventually dominates over both the linear term @xmath85 and @xmath86 part .",
    "this leads to the divergence of the biasing parameter @xmath10 on very large scales .    according to heavens , matarrese & verde ( 1998 ) ,",
    "the constant power in the @xmath87 part is interpreted as the shot - noise term , which is a consequence of the local ansatz for the galaxy distribution ( see eq.[[init - g ] ] ) .",
    "although the constant power can be measured on extremely large scales , this would become negligible on realistic scales of the galaxy surveys .",
    "therefore , we will analyze the power spectrum @xmath8 on the scales where the effect ( i ) becomes negligible .    on the other hand , the clustering of galaxies incorporated by the non - gaussian initial condition ( [ init - g ] ) leads to the effect ( ii ) , which would have a more practical importance for the data analysis of galaxy surveys .",
    "the dominant contribution of this effect comes from the @xmath63 part . in our case",
    ", the initial biasing parameter is estimated using equation ( [ pg13 ] ) : @xmath88 the expression ( [ effective - b ] ) shows that the deviation from linear theory prediction depends on the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath50 and @xmath45 . the spectrum @xmath49 with the cutoff",
    "parameter implies that the parameter @xmath89 would have the cutoff dependence . in a realistic situation ,",
    "the clustering property characterized by the assumption ( [ init - g ] ) might in general depend on the scale .",
    "hence , it is natural to have the cutoff dependence . as for the initial correlation coefficient",
    ", it remains unchanged due to the assumption ( [ init - g ] ) .",
    "the expressions ( [ pg13 ] ) and ( [ pcross13 ] ) yield @xmath90 which is valid as long as @xmath91 .",
    "notice that the gravitational evolution alters the effective biasing and the correlation coefficient .",
    "the non - linear biasing parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the one - loop spectra dynamically affect these parameters .",
    "further , the non - linear growth of density fluctuations might change the evolution .",
    "we now consider the time evolution of the biasing parameter @xmath10 and correlation coefficient @xmath11 . in the rest of this paper , we present the results for the linear spectrum @xmath49 given by the standard cdm model .",
    "although we have also examined the two - power - law model of makino , sasaki & suto ( 1992 ) , we obtained the qualitatively similar results to those shown below .",
    "thus , our results would be general in the case of the realistic spectrum with a break .",
    "the evolved results of the weakly non - linear power spectra ( [ weakly - ps ] ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the thin - solid , thick - solid , and thick - dashed lines are the power spectra @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 evaluated at present , respectively .",
    "the initial conditions are set at @xmath105 .",
    "choosing the non - gaussian parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 as zero , we specify the parameters @xmath106 so that the initial biasing parameter and initial correlation coefficient obtained from ( [ def - of - b - r2 ] ) become @xmath107 , @xmath108 .    in figure 1 , the evolved spectra for galaxies and cross correlation become the larger power than that of the total mass due to the initial large biasing .",
    "we have also displayed the linear power spectrum of the total mass @xmath109 ( see eq.[[linear - ps ] ] ) .",
    "compared to the linear order result , the weakly non - linear spectrum shows the enhancement of the power on small scales , while both @xmath109 and @xmath7 have the same power on large scales .",
    "this behavior is known as the weakly non - linear effect ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the validity of the weakly non - linear result has been checked using the non - linear fitting formula by peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) .",
    "the one - loop correction of the total mass rather overestimates the non - linear growth at @xmath110 .",
    "however , until @xmath111 , the weakly non - linear spectrum @xmath7 is well - fitted to the formula by peacock & dodds and the qualitative behaviors did not change at @xmath110 .    in figure 2",
    ", using the definition ( [ def - of - b - r2 ] ) , we evaluate the biasing parameter @xmath10 and the correlation coefficient @xmath11 as the function of the fourier mode @xmath93 . within the validity of the perturbation ,",
    "the snapshots of both parameters with the same initial conditions as used in figure 1 are depicted for the different redshift parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 . on large scales ,",
    "the spatial dependence of the biasing parameter and the correlation coefficient is very weak and they approach the constant values .",
    "the same behaviors can be obtained in the presence of initial non - gaussianity , consistent with the results by several authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the scale - dependence of the galaxy biasing exists on small scales .",
    "although @xmath10 and @xmath11 initially lose their power due to the high frequency cutoff @xmath76 , the spatial variation of the biasing parameter and the correlation coefficient gradually changes .    in the following",
    ", we shall separately analyze the time evolution in the linear scale and the quasi - linear scale .",
    "here , the linear scale means that the evolution of the total mass power spectrum can be well - approximated by the linear perturbation ( [ linear - ps ] ) .",
    "the quasi - linear scale denotes the scales where the growth of non - linear correction for the total mass spectrum can become significant , corresponding to @xmath114 mpc@xmath115 in figure 1 .      since the non - locality of the gravitational evolution does not affect the biasing feature in the linear regime , the scale - independence of @xmath10 and @xmath11 simply relies on the assumption of the local initial conditions ( see eq.[[init - g ] ] ) .",
    "we thus analyze the time evolution by fixing the mode @xmath116 mpc@xmath115 . for our purpose , it is important to clarify the influence of the initial non - gaussianity and the stochasticity to the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "hence , by varying the non - gaussian initial parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we consider the two cases : almost deterministic biasing ( @xmath107 @xmath108 at @xmath105 ) and stochastic biasing ( @xmath107 @xmath117 at @xmath105 ) . because the initial non - gaussianity slightly affects the initial conditions @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath11 , we appropriately adjust the model parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 so that the above conditions are satisfied .",
    "the list of the model parameters examined in this subsection is shown in table 1 , together with the evolved results @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "they are compared with the linear prediction ( [ linear - b - r ] ) under the same initial conditions @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting evolution @xmath10 and @xmath11 is depicted in figure 3a for the nearly deterministic biasing and figure 3b for the stochastic biasing case .",
    "the results are naively extrapolated to the present time @xmath110 .",
    "first , consider the time evolution of the biasing parameter @xmath10 . in the deterministic biasing case ( upper panel of figure 3a )",
    ", the solid line shows the result with the vanishing initial non - gaussianity . on the scale @xmath116 mpc@xmath115",
    ", there still exists the scale - dependence of the biasing , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "this slightly alters the time evolution of @xmath10 , compared to the linear prediction @xmath56 ( _ thin solid line _ ) .",
    "however , this deviation is small and the weakly non - linear evolution is in good accordance with the linear prediction until @xmath111 . the same behavior is obtained in the non - gaussian initial condition @xmath120 ( _ dotted line _ ) . although the non - gaussian parameter @xmath45 modifies the initial biasing parameter @xmath121 predicted by the linear theory ( see eq.[[effective - b ] ] ) , the resulting evolution is well approximated by the linear evolution @xmath56 with the observed initial condition @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "however , the deviation from the linear evolution is found in the presence of the initial non - gaussianity @xmath122 .",
    "the long - dashed and the short - dashed lines are the results with the initial parameter @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively . in the one - loop power spectrum @xmath125 , the terms proportional to the parameter",
    "@xmath44 has the time dependence @xmath126 ( see eq.[[pg13 ] ] ) , which is the same growth rate as appeared in the linear spectrum @xmath85 ( see eq.[[linear - ps ] ] ) .",
    "this means that the clustering property induced by the initial non - gaussianity tends to remain and the deviation from the linear theory would become increasing . in the @xmath127 case , we have the positively skewed distribution of galaxies , while the total mass distribution is nearly gaussian . thus , the fluctuation @xmath1 correlated with the total mass becomes more and more concentrated on the total mass , which dynamically leads to the larger biasing parameter @xmath10 .",
    "vice versa , the smaller value @xmath10 could be attained in the case of the initial skewness @xmath128 .    the results of the stochastic biasing case ( @xmath107 , @xmath117 at @xmath105 ) are displayed in figure 3b .",
    "for the biasing parameter @xmath10 with the initial non - gaussianity @xmath122 , remarkably , the deviation from the linear theory prediction is reduced . from the expressions ( [ pg22 ] ) and ( [ pg13 ] ) , one can show that the one - loop corrected terms proportional to the parameter @xmath44 depends on the multiplicative factor @xmath129 .",
    "the small value of the initial correlation coefficient @xmath130 forces the galaxy distribution to correlate with the total mass .",
    "this behavior also affects the galaxy clustering and it can weaken the effect of initial non - gaussianity . hence , the biasing parameter @xmath10 could be approximated by the linear theory @xmath56 .",
    "next , we consider the correlation coefficient . in the bottom panel of figure 3 , we plot time evolution of @xmath11 with the same initial parameters as examined in the upper panel of figure 3 . as was remarked by dekel & lahav ( 1999 ) , the non - linear biasing such as the initial condition ( [ init - g ] ) can bend the @xmath1-@xmath0 relation and it effectively decreases the correlation coefficient , compared to the linear result @xmath131 . in both panels of figure 3a and figure 3b ,",
    "the effect of non - linear biasing , corresponding to the non - vanishing parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 is very weak .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath11 can be well - approximated by the linear prediction with the initial conditions @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "we have also analyzed the time evolution for more various initial conditions .",
    "the examples for the initial anti - biasing case are listed in table 1 .",
    "we see that the influence of the initial non - gaussianity to the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 becomes weak and the linear prediction does work well . in table 1 ,",
    "the cutoff dependence @xmath76 is also examined .",
    "the small value of the cutoff wavelength @xmath134 mpc@xmath115 increases the parameter @xmath89 given by ( [ effective - b ] ) , which strengthens the efficiency of the non - gaussianity .",
    "in particular , the high frequency cutoff with the initial skewness @xmath123 has the curious behavior that the present correlation coefficient @xmath11 becomes larger than unity , which can not be allowed because the schwarz inequality states @xmath135 . as for the non - vanishing initial kurtosis @xmath45",
    ", we obtain the same present values @xmath10 and @xmath11 as obtained in the cutoff @xmath136 mpc@xmath115 case . however , the effective biasing induced by the non - gaussianity is significant and we have the small value of the initial parameter @xmath137 .      on quasi - linear scales",
    "@xmath138mpc@xmath115 , the next - to - leading order of non - linear gravity gives the important contribution to the growth of total matter power spectra ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we pay attention to the non - linear growth , which may be related to the scale - dependence of the biasing shown in figure 2 . from the weakly non - linear analysis @xmath7 by several authors",
    ", we have recognized that the mode - mode coupling of long - wave modes contributes to the amplitude of the short - wavelength fluctuations ( @xcite ) .",
    "this leads that the power spectrum evolves with the different growth rate , depending on the effective spectral index @xmath139 .",
    "for the typical spectrum like the cdm model , the one - loop correction causes the significant enhancement of the high-@xmath93 part of the power spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the weakly non - linear effect also appears in the power spectrum of galaxies @xmath8 and the cross correlation @xmath9 ( see eqs.[[pg22]]-[[pcross13 ] ] ) . on appropriately small scales , we could find the enhancement of perturbation @xmath1 , whose growth rate depends on the initial parameters @xmath140 and the initial non - gaussianity , in addition to the effective index @xmath139 .",

    "the results at redshift @xmath110 are also displayed to emphasize the qualitative behavior . in any cases ,",
    "the scale - dependence of the biasing can not become significant within the validity of the perturbation theory , however , the scale - dependence obviously exists .",
    "the variation of the parameters @xmath143 and @xmath144 becomes larger on smaller scales .",
    "the characteristic behavior can be recognized in the two cases @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which can be deduced from the one - loop spectrum ( [ pg22])-([pcross13 ] ) . for our qualitative understanding ,",
    "we simply restrict the analysis on the @xmath149 cases .",
    "figure 4a is the case @xmath147 , which has the initial condition @xmath132 at @xmath105 .",
    "compared to the total mass distribution , the strong clustering of initial galaxies well - correlating with the total mass enhances the non - linear growth of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the one - loop correction of the biasing parameter and the correlation coefficient increases in time . on the other hand",
    ", the initial distribution @xmath1 with the low correlation does not lead to the enhancement of clustering feature , but rather weakens the growth of fluctuations to have the sufficient correlation with the total mass .",
    "figure 4b corresponds to this situation , in which we have chosen the condition as @xmath133 .",
    "because the growth of perturbation @xmath0 becomes larger than that of @xmath1 , the biasing parameter @xmath143 decreases .",
    "interestingly , the one - loop correction @xmath144 initially decreases , although the evolution eventually strengthen the correlation .",
    "in this paper , we have focused on the gravitational evolution of the stochastic galaxy biasing deduced from the power spectrum . using the perturbation theory",
    ", we develop the analysis taking into account the one - loop correction of the non - linear gravity . assuming the non - local distribution @xmath39 for the total mass and the local initial condition @xmath40 for the galaxy distribution",
    ", we examine the weakly non - linear power spectra and investigate the time evolution of biasing parameter and the correlation coefficient .",
    "the important conclusions are summarized as follows :    * we found that the initial non - gaussianity affects the galaxy biasing significantly . in the deterministic biasing ,",
    "the time evolution of the biasing parameter with the non - vanishing initial skewness deviates from the linear theory prediction by tegmark & peebles ( 1998 ) , even in the linear regime .",
    "as time goes on , the deviation can not be neglected .",
    "however , the deviation can be reduced in the presence of the initial stochasticity . on the other hand",
    ", the correlation coefficient does not suffer from the initial non - gaussianity .",
    "the time evolution of the correlation coefficient is well - approximated by the linear evolution . *",
    "the local initial condition of the galaxy distribution leads to the almost scale - independent evolution of the biasing on large scales .",
    "however , on quasi - linear scales , the one - loop correction of gravity becomes important and it can give the scale - dependence of the biasing . in the typical cases with @xmath147 and @xmath148 , we have the different prediction of the scale - dependence .",
    "for the low correlation @xmath148 , we have the small biasing parameter , compared with the one on large scales .",
    "the prediction of the scale - dependent biasing just comes from the weakly non - linear results .",
    "we can not say anything about the strong non - linear regime beyond the one - loop correction . however , the weakly non - linear analysis is suitable in investigating the transition from the linear to the non - linear regime .",
    "therefore , our qualitative prediction will not change as long as the gravity plays a role for the scale - dependent biasing .",
    "in fact , the halo biasing property taking into account the merging process has recently shown that the biasing parameter decreases as the smoothing scale of density fluctuation becomes small .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "further , there is a suggestion that the halo - halo correlation can become anti - biasing on the relatively large scale @xmath150 mpc@xmath115 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the gravitational clustering gives an important contribution .",
    "therefore , the qualitative behavior can be partially understood from our weakly non - linear analysis .    as a demonstration",
    ", we plot the power spectra @xmath7 and @xmath8 at @xmath151 and @xmath152 in figure 5 ( _ left panel _ ) .",
    "the parameters are given at @xmath151 , chosen as @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , i.e , we have the large scatter in the initial @xmath1-@xmath0 relation . on the scales",
    "@xmath156 mpc@xmath115 , the perturbation theory breaks down at @xmath157 that the one - loop correction of the total mass dominates the linear order power spectrum @xmath158 .",
    "however , within the validity domain , the weakly non - linear spectrum @xmath8 decreases its power in the high frequency part and the anti - biasing property appears .",
    "this behavior can be illuminated by comparing with the n - body simulation in the right panel of figure 5 , where the spectrum of dark matter particles @xmath7 and halos @xmath159 are presented .",
    "the halo and the dark matter catalogue of the simulation are based on the standard cdm model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the halos are identified using the friend - of - friends algorithm and selected with the mass threshold @xmath160 .",
    "although the halo biasing at @xmath151 is rather larger than the weakly non - linear biasing , the similarities at @xmath157 is apparent . for the detailed comparison ,",
    "further implementation of our analysis is needed , including the merging process of the halos .",
    "the volume exclusion of the halos could be essential for the anti - biasing on small scales .",
    "however , the similarities seen in figure 5 implies that the gravitational evolution and the stochasticity of the galaxy biasing play important role for the present biasing features . we will proceed to improve our treatment quantitatively to explain the halo biasing .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we have neglected the galaxy formation . for a realistic situation including this process",
    ", the cosmological simulation by blanton , cen & tegmark ( 1999 ) shows that the hot gas in the overdense region prevents the star formation and the relation between the galaxies and the dark matter becomes a poor correlation .",
    "the realistic process will play a role for explaining the origin of stochasticity .",
    "combining it with our analysis might yield the interesting results .",
    "potentially , the effective biasing parameter due to the initial non - gaussianity can cause a serious problem .",
    "the determination of the parameters @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the correlation coefficient @xmath11 from the observational data would become difficult if there exists the significant contribution of the non - gaussianity to the galaxy clustering .",
    "the method using the higher order correlation ( @xcite , @xcite ) should be used carefully , which is partly mentioned by taruya & soda ( 1999 ) .",
    "this might lead to a more practical issue , that is , the theoretical prediction of the high redshift objects such as the quasars . in this case , the various cosmological effects should be taken into account .",
    "the cosmological redshift distortion and the light - cone effect appeared in the statistical quantities are not negligible for the data analysis ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the situation will become more complicated in the case of the biasing being stochastic and non - linear .",
