    "the kinetic energy of electrons is quenched and the physical properties of the system are determined by electron - electron interactions alone .",
    "bilayer quantum hall systems at landau level filling factor @xmath2 exhibit a rich variety of broken symmetry states  @xcite and have been extensively studied over the past decade  @xcite . for filling factor @xmath2 ,",
    "the ground state is fully spin polarized and the spin excitations are gapped because of zeeman coupling of electron spins to the external magnetic field .",
    "the only remaining dynamical degrees of freedom are the discrete layer index and the intra - landau level orbitals .",
    "we model the layer index using a pseudospin label where `` up '' denotes the symmetric bilayer state ( s ) and `` down '' denotes the antisymmetric bilayer state ( as ) . _",
    "note that this choice of quantization axis is different from the usual convention where `` up '' denotes a state localized in the top layer .",
    "_ at _ total _ filling factor @xmath2 , because of strong interlayer correlations , the ground state of the system exhibits _ spontaneous _ interlayer phase coherence ( easy - plane ferromagnetism in the pseudospin language ) and is incompressible  @xcite . at a critical layer separation @xmath3",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition from this incompressible quantum hall state with pseudospin ferromagnetism to a disordered compressible state  @xcite , possibly with other more exotic intervening states  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a theory which describes effect of quantum fluctuations on the hartree - fock quasiparticles of the @xmath2 bilayer .",
    "some of the results presented here were published earlier  @xcite .",
    "our theory is based on an approximate expression for the quasiparticle self - energy which includes the effect of quantum fluctuations and generalizes the random phase approximation ( rpa ) to cases when both direct and exchange fluctuations are important .",
    "this self - energy modifies the spectral function of the mean - field quasiparticles , which in turn renormalizes the physical properties of the system .",
    "the most important macroscopic parameter characterizing the phase - coherent state is the pseudospin polarization .",
    "we use pseudospin polarization normalized to its mean - field value as a dimensionless order parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this order parameter is related to quasiparticle spectral weights integrated up to the fermi energy , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denote occupation numbers for the symmetric and antisymmetric states .",
    "therefore the order parameter is sensitive to changes in the quasiparticle spectral function . in the mean - field approximation",
    "the quasiparticles have sharply defined energies and the spectral functions are @xmath7-functions at these energies . in the mean - field ground state , all electrons occupy the symmetric state in the lowest landau level , which corresponds to all pseudospins pointing along the positive @xmath8-axis , @xmath9",
    ". we will find that when we include the effect of collective fluctuations , the spectral functions develop a continuum piece and the spectral weight at the @xmath7-function peak is reduced .",
    "we will calculate the renormalized order parameter by evaluating the fluctuation correction to the mean - field spectral function .",
    "the generalized random phase approximation for quasiparticle self - energy presented in this paper can be usefully adopted to study the effect of quantum fluctuations on mean - field quasiparticles whenever the collective - mode behavior is determined by fluctuations in more than one particle - hole channels ; for example , to analyze the effect of fluctuations on wigner crystal mean - field quasiparticles at low filling factors .",
    "traditionally random phase approximations have been used either to take into account the screening of coulomb interaction  @xcite where only direct - channel interactions determine the physics , or the effect of spin - waves on a ferromagnetic mean - field state  @xcite where the low - energy physics is solely determined by exchange interactions .",
    "the generalization which we present here systematically takes into account fluctuations in both channels .",
    "we study the bilayer quantum hall system as a test case because its translation invariance combined with the absence of dispersion in the landau level bands permits many elements of this calculation to be performed analytically , and because the effect of quantum fluctuations on the mean - field ground state can be tuned over a large range simply by changing the layer separation . in the @xmath10 limit ,",
    "since the interaction hamiltonian is pseudospin invariant , the mean - field ground state is exact . at finite @xmath0 , because of the difference between the intralayer coulomb interaction @xmath11 and the interlayer coulomb interaction @xmath12 , the symmetry of the interaction hamiltonian is reduced from su(2 ) to u(1 ) , and the order parameter @xmath4 does not commute with the interaction .",
    "therefore the pseudospin - polarized mean - field state is not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian and in particular , it is not the ground state .",
    "the exact ground state of this system incorporates quantum fluctuations in the quantum hall ferromagnet s order parameter field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : affia ] we describe the functional integral approach to this problem .",

    "we conclude the paper with a brief discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in bilayer systems , the anisotropy of the coulomb interaction in pseudospin space makes it necessary to treat fluctuations in the hartree and exchange channels on an equal footing .",
    "a general way to treat fluctuations around an ordered mean - field is the hubbard stratonovich transformation  @xcite . in this approach , by introducing an integral over a bose field @xmath13 , we convert the two - body fermionic interaction term into a one - body term coupled to this field . since the effective hamiltonian obtained is quadratic in fermion operators , the trace over these degrees of freedom can be performed exactly and we obtain an effective action for the auxiliary bose field .",
    "stationary phase approximations to the bosonic action give various mean - field theories .",
    "the nature of the mean - field state depends upon the way the hubbard stratonovich transformation is implemented and the predictions for collective excitations depend qualitatively on the mean - field around which gaussian fluctuations in the bose field are considered .",
    "for example , fluctuations in the exchange mean - field produce spin - wave excitations in ferromagnets , whereas fluctuations in the hartree mean - field lead to plasmons in an electron gas . for a bilayer system ,",
    "we need a method which treats both hartree and exchange fluctuations on an equal footing .",
    "it is known that the standard hs transformation does _ not _ yield a hartree - fock mean - field and can not capture _ both _ hartree and the exchange fluctuations  @xcite .",

    "this paper discusses an approximation for the self - energy of interacting electrons that goes beyond the venerable random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "depending on context the rpa describes in an approximate way the interactions of electrons with fluctuations in either direct or exchange particle - hole channels .",
    "there are many circumstances , however , where both channels must be treated on an equal footing if the qualitative physics is to be captured .",
    "the objective of the approximation scheme discussed here is to fill this need .",
    "we have developed our approximation in the language of a path - integral approach developed by kerman _",
    ", that , unlike standard auxiliary - field path integral approaches , enables expansions to be made around hartree - fock mean - field states in which the quasiparticles experience both direct and exchange fluctuating potentials . the same approximation for the self - energy can be derived by differentiating the approximation for the grand potential that follows from this generalized rpa scheme , with respect to the mean - field green s function .",
    "we have identified the infinite subset of many - body perturbation theory feynman diagrams that are included in this self - energy approximation .",
    "as far as we are aware , this self - energy approximation has not been considered previously .",
    "we have applied our formalism to the ground state of bilayer quantum hall systems at filling factor @xmath2 .",
    "this ground state has a broken symmetry in which phase - coherence is spontaneously established between the two layers in order to take advantage of interlayer exchange and improve interlayer correlations .",
    "its collective excitations involve both fluctuations in the interlayer phase and fluctuations in the difference between charge densities in each layer . in order to describe the energetics of these fluctuations ,",
    "it is necessary to include both direct and exchange particle - hole interactions .",
    "bilayer quantum hall systems therefore provide an example of a situation where the standard rpa will fail quite badly .",
    "our approximate self - energy properly describes the interactions between quasiparticles in this system and the collective excitations of its order parameter field .",
    "bilayer quantum hall systems provide an interesting example for our approach because the importance of fluctuations for the ground state properties can be tuned between zero and large values by varying the layer separation .",
    "it is now well established by both theory and experiment that bilayer quantum hall systems have a quantum phase transition  @xcite at a finite value of @xmath0 where the phase - coherence is lost .",
    "our approximate self - energy calculation correctly obtains an order parameter that vanishes beyond a critical value of @xmath0 , however , we do not expect it to be reliable very close to the transition point , whether it is first order or continuous .",
    "the bilayer quantum hall case is also favorable because particle - hole excitations of the ground state have momentum as a good quantum number and there is only one excitation at each momentum . in effect , there is only one excited state at each momentum , the collective excitation .",
    "much as in the case of a one - dimensional electron system , there is no particle - hole continuum in the excitation spectrum .",
    "this greatly simplifies the calculation and allows us to derive a remarkably simple analytic expression for the self - energy .",
    "we have confirmed the physical content of our theory by demonstrating its equivalence , for the case of bilayer quantum hall systems , to an adiabatic approximation in which the hartree - fock single - particle hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the order - parameter field , via the density matrix . the possibility of specifying the density matrix that appears in the hartree - fock single - particle hamiltonian in terms of the order parameter field is unique to quantum hall systems . therefore this simple relationship can not always be established .",
    "nevertheless , this example demonstrates the ability of the approximation we discuss to accurately capture the effect of important fluctuations on quasiparticle properties .",
    "we believe that our approximate self - energy will be useful for other situations as well .",
    "a potentially interesting example is provided by the case of superconductors for which coupled fluctuations in the phase of the order parameter and of the charge density form elementary excitations and both pairing and electrostatic energies are important . in the case of superconductors",
    "it is particle - particle channel fluctuations are important for phase - fluctuations , unlike the case of bilayer quantum hall systems .",
    "the problems can be made quite similar , however , by performing a particle - hole transformation for , say , the down - spins of the superconductor , turning the superconducting order into easy - plane ferromagnetism .",
    "in fact , going in the opposite direction , the order of a bilayer quantum hall ferromagnet can be regarded as an electron - hole pair condensate by making a particle - hole transformation in one of the layers . in the case of a superconductor",
    "it is well - known that the long - range of the electron - electron interaction turns the collective modes into gapped plasmons , usually leading to high accuracy for the mean - field treatment of a superconductor .",
    "this can change , however , if the collective excitations become soft at large wavevectors as they do in bilayer quantum hall systems .",
    "such softness could be associated , for example , with partial fermi surface nesting .    in this work ,",
    "we have concentrated on _ quantum _ fluctuation effects at _ zero _ temperature .",
    "it is easy to obtain corresponding expressions for finite temperature self - energy , though they are somewhat cumbersome . in the limit of vanishing layer separation , @xmath178 ,",
    "the finite - temperature expressions reproduce , with the appropriate identification of pseudospin with spin , the spin - wave contribution to the electron self - energy in a single - layer system  @xcite .",
    "we have neglected the form - factors which encode the effects of finite well - widths since their inclusion does not change the results qualitatively .",
    "they can be incorporated without difficulty when modeling a specific system .",
