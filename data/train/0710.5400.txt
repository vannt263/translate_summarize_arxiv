    "the lack of analytic solutions for the most centrally symmetric potentials calls for developing method approximating the spectra .",
    "it becomes extremely actually at present as besides known problems in atomic physics , theoretical models of nuclei @xcite or quarkonium @xcite there arises a number of new objects ( metallic clusters @xcite etc ) for which some analogies of the periodic system of shells may be constructed @xcite .",
    "they may differ not only by the nature of selfconsistent field but even by their dimensionality @xmath0 .",
    "a lot of endeavours have been put to obtain rigorous results , see e.g. @xcite , but these theorems only give some inequalities for special forms of potentials and only for @xmath1 .",
    "a frequent supposition is that the energy values depend on some linear combinations of the radial @xmath2 and orbital @xmath3 quantum numbers , i.e. @xmath4 . the madelung - kletchkovsky rule predicts appearing of new shells @xmath5 in the periodic system of the elements with increasing @xmath6 @xcite , for the metallic clusters it is expected @xmath7 @xcite , a similar quantum number for nuclei was proposed in @xcite by using some classical analogy .",
    "however , such dependence of the exact spectra on some linear combination is known only for the coulomb and oscillator potentials : @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10    two remarkable facts are known ( at least for @xmath1 ) for our reference potentials ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) and only for them .",
    "first of all , the usual wkb condition @xmath11 leads to the exact spectra ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) . for @xmath1 the term @xmath12 is known as the centrifugal potential with the langer correction @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "besides , for the oscillator @xmath14 in all cases the integration goes between corresponding turning points and we put @xmath15 . combining ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath16 so that in the right hand of ( [ 6 ] ) we see the same linear combination of @xmath17 and @xmath18 as in ( [ 2 ] ) , a similar situation with @xmath19 we obtain for ( [ 1 ] ) .    in the present paper",
    "we get an effective quantum number @xmath20 for any centrally symmetric potentials and any dimensionality of the problem by means of some generalization and new universal variations of the methods used earlier @xcite in order to obtain @xmath21 for @xmath1 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath22 is determined as some definite combination of the functionals @xmath23 $ ] , which represent asymptotic estimates for the total number of the bound states in a given potential @xmath24 with the energies not exceeding @xmath25 .",
    "these estimates are obtained without using any wkb method .",
    "this quantum number @xmath21 ( [ 7 ] ) determines the order of the bound states : @xmath26 if @xmath27 . for our reference cases ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath21 coincides with @xmath19 and @xmath28 correspondingly . in a general case @xmath21 approximates very good the real situation , but is not formally the exact quantum number .",
    "note that the principal quantum number @xmath29 determines the spectrum only for the coulomb potential if @xmath1 .",
    "we use the schrdinger equation in the form ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the laplace operator on the unit sphere @xmath33 , @xmath25 is the energy value and @xmath24 is the potential .",
    "the equation ( [ 8 ] ) corresponds to the following metric : @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 being coordinates on @xmath37 .    in order to eliminate the first derivative in ( [ 8 ] ) and the singularity at @xmath38 we represent the schrdinger equation in a conformal metric @xmath39 with a new variable @xmath40 so that @xmath41 using [ 9 , ",

    "taking into account eigenvalues @xmath45 and the term @xmath46 in ( [ 11 ] ) , for @xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 @xmath49    usual condition @xmath50 leads to @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",
    "exact spectra of ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) must be identical as @xmath44 and @xmath53 are only distinguished by a positive factor @xmath54 .",
    "we have seen that the usual `` automatic '' replacement @xmath55 actually means that we work in a new special conformal curved space ; its curvature is @xmath56 with @xmath57 from ( [ 11 ] ) . instead of the topology",
    "@xmath58 we get @xmath59 in the conformal space .",
    "coordinates @xmath60 are similar to the cartesian ones in the maximum possible measure : @xmath61 is a harmonic coordinate , there is a field of the parallel vectors and all sections @xmath62 are identical ones @xcite .",
    "that is why the leading wkb approximation in the conformal space gives the best possible result ( while exact spectra must be identical in two metrics @xmath63 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that the number of eigenstates with the same value of @xmath3 is @xmath64 and @xmath65 if @xmath66 . substituting in ( [ 15 ] )",
    "@xmath18 ( [ 3 ] ) we get the leading term @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 is of order @xmath72 if @xmath73 .",
    "the leading term of @xmath74 as a function of @xmath3 is simply @xmath75 , but @xmath76 is of order @xmath77 .",
    "for example , if @xmath78 we have @xmath79 .",
    "thus in @xmath80 there is no term of order @xmath81 unlike @xmath82 , so that namely @xmath83 is the most suitable variable with smallest distinction between @xmath74 and the leading term @xmath67 .",
    "the wkb quantization condition for ( [ 13 ] ) is @xmath84 obviously ( [ 17 ] ) is identical to ( [ 4 ] ) when we return to previous variables @xmath85 ( [ 8 ] ) .",

    "we can write @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes all non - linear corrections . for above cases ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath89 and @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .    for determining @xmath22",
    "we use hereafter the known estimates @xmath92 for the total number of bound states in @xmath0 dimensional problem with the energies not exceeding @xmath25 @xcite ; being expressed in our variables @xmath93 they look as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the beta function .",
    "let s show how @xmath92 ( [ 19 ] ) may be obtained using ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) . at a fixed @xmath18 ( [ 5 ] ) the equation ( [ 17 ] )",
    "determines energies of the bound states .",
    "evidently the maximum value of @xmath96 corresponds to the maximum energy , so that @xmath97 is equal to the total number of bound states with a given @xmath18 and values of energies not exceeding @xmath25 ( as usual in wkb we neglect the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath17 in this case ) .",
    "now we have to take into account the degeneration of states ( [ 16 ] ) . using the universal form of the first term @xmath98",
    ", we multiply @xmath99 ( [ 17 ] ) by @xmath67 and integrate with respect to @xmath100 over all possible domain @xmath101 , @xmath102 we suppose that @xmath103 has sole maximum at any @xmath25 . in intermediate calculations we treat @xmath100 as a continuous variable . changing the order of integration",
    "we really obtain @xmath104 with @xmath92 from ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "thus namely the leading term @xmath105 but not @xmath74 must be used in wkb methods .",
    "now we return to ( [ 18 ] ) and intend to choose value of @xmath22 so that @xmath106 averaged over all bound states becomes zero . multiplying both sides of ( [ 18 ] ) by @xmath67 and integrating with respect to @xmath18 we obtain @xmath107 obviously @xmath108 is proportional to @xmath109 so that the value of @xmath22 does not depend on @xmath110 .",
    "it is also invariant under the transformation @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath112 .    in order to simplify ( [ 21 ] ) we introduce relative parameters @xmath113 comparing @xmath108 for a given potential with @xmath114 for the above reference case : the coulomb potential with the same value of @xmath110 as in @xmath92 . calculating @xmath115 we get @xmath116",
    "we have used here some identities between the beta functions and their products . substituting ( [ 22 ] ) in ( [ 21 ] ) and using ( [ 19 ] ) we obtain finally @xmath117 in general case we have @xmath118 . for our reference cases ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath119 does not depend on @xmath0 as well as on @xmath25 and coincides with the discussed above @xmath120 .",

    "let s use the fact that the integral ( [ 19 ] ) has the original form for the asymptotic laplace expansion : @xmath305 where @xmath215 are known functions of the derivatives @xmath306 taken at the maximum point @xmath307 , @xmath308 .",
    "expanding @xmath309 in the denominator of ( [ 23 ] ) similarly to ( [ 47 ] ) we obtain an asymptotic expansion of @xmath125 ( [ 26 ] ) , ( [ 31 ] ) , where @xmath310 a special case of such expansion is ( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "of course we can also calculate @xmath151 as @xmath311 for @xmath147 ( even for nonanalytic potentials , when ( [ 48 ] ) may be incorrect ) .",
    "it is easy to prove numerically that all interesting model potentials including those represented in the table  [ tab : table1 ] have @xmath312 , @xmath313 and so on .",
    "e.  g. for power - law potentials ( [ 28 ] ) we have accordingly to ( [ 32 ] ) @xmath314 and only in an irreal case @xmath315 we get @xmath316 .",
    "thus the asymptotic regime is already reached for @xmath317 ( actually for @xmath318 ) .",
    "that s why @xmath125 are smooth monotonic functions for @xmath319 .    using @xmath320 ( [ 34 ] )",
    "we can get an interesting expression equivalent to ( [ 48 ] ) : @xmath321 for power - law potentials @xmath322 and we return to ( [ 30 ] ) .    neglecting in @xmath323 ( [ 26 ] ) , ( [ 31 ] ) all terms with @xmath324 we obtain a simple approximation @xmath325 substituting ( [ 50 ] ) in ( [ 23 ] ) , we also have @xmath326    at last comparing ( [ 50 ] ) and ( [ 51 ] ) we obtain another approximate expression @xmath327 we have calculated ratios @xmath328 and @xmath329 where @xmath330 is the basic form ( [ 23 ] ) for various potentials and for a wide interval of @xmath25 .",
    "it turns out that even for @xmath1 both @xmath331 and @xmath332 are close to unity : @xmath333 and in most cases @xmath334 .",
    "as we have already said , the closest approximation to the basic additive form @xmath22 is the multiplicative form @xmath335 ( [ 25 ] ) : for their ratio @xmath336 we have @xmath337 and in most cases @xmath338 , see table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "each of these approximations may be preferable in some suitable situation .",
    "a simple universal form @xmath339 ( [ 50 ] ) allows us to get an universal non - linear approximation @xmath340 for @xmath97 ( [ 17 ] ) . acting as in sec .",
    "[ sec : section3 ] we obtain instead of ( [ 23 ] ) @xmath341 if we assume @xmath342 in ( [ 54 ] ) , we return to @xmath22 ( [ 23 ] ) . but",
    "this time we use @xmath125 ( [ 50 ] ) and thus come to a simple melline transform for @xmath343 : @xmath344 correspondingly we obtain a non - linear in @xmath18 quantization condition @xmath345 both ( [ 55 ] ) and ( [ 56 ] ) become incorrect if @xmath346 , but actually if @xmath347 we have a finite @xmath348 even for @xmath349 , see ( [ 13 ] ) ; in real systems usually @xmath350 .",
    "let s reproduce a delicate distinction obtained for the power - law potentials ( [ 28 ] ) by means of the @xmath351-expansion of the regge trajectories @xcite .",
    "using our notation we can rewrite the final result @xcite in a simple form for @xmath352 @xmath353 since @xmath354 for ( [ 28 ] ) the left side of ( [ 57 ] ) is linear in @xmath21 ; by substituting @xmath355 ( [ 56 ] ) in ( [ 57 ] ) , we obtain @xmath356 we have used here the fact that @xmath357 , so that @xmath358 . but",
    "the last equality ( [ 58 ] ) really fulfills for our @xmath125 , see e.  g. table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "should be stressed that in any linear approximation the left side of eq .",
    "( [ 57 ] ) is equal to zero , and not to one as for @xmath359 , so that only non - linear approximation confirms the strong result @xcite .",
    "thus we have constructed and calculated the effective quantum number @xmath21 ( [ 7 ] ) which determines with very high accuracy appearing and ordering of the bound states in any centrally symmetric potential .",
    "it should be stressed that different potentials may have very close or coinciding values of @xmath22 and @xmath21 and hence identical levels ordering ( see e.  g. cases b ) and c ) in the table  [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "some partial success of using the thomas - fermi potential to explain the periodic system does not mean that this potential is the genuine or the best one .",
    "the point is that its @xmath22 is situated not too close to the limiting points of the interval ( [ 46 ] ) so that various corrections not taken into account in the thomas - fermi approach though change @xmath22 but remain it inside this interval .",
    "hence the levels ordering is really the same as for the thomas - fermi potential .      using @xmath21",
    "we immediately reproduce many results received for the levels ordering by means of special theorems and numerical calculations .",
    "moreover , the quantization condition ( [ 24 ] ) with @xmath21 can also be used for determining spectra .",
    "the accuracy of the energy values calculated for @xmath361 is @xmath362% and even in the worst case of the non - analytic potential well ( @xmath363 ) errors do not exceed @xmath364% @xcite . for two potentials with the same value of @xmath22",
    "we usually obtain different @xmath110 and @xmath365 , so that their energies of the bound states do not coincide unlike the levels ordering .      99 a. bohr , b. r. mottelson , _ nuclear structure _ ( w. a. benjamin inc . , new york , amsterdam , 1974 ) , vol .",
