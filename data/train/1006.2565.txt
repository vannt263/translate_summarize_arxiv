    "the relay channel ( rc ) @xcite , is a communication system in which a message is transmitted from the source to the destination with the help of a relay .",
    "the partially cooperative relay broadcast channel ( pc - rbc ) studied in @xcite , is a generalization of rc in which the source node also sends a private message intended for the relay node .",
    "therefore , in this channel the relay is also a sink of data .",
    "the relay channel with private messages ( rcpm ) studied in @xcite , is a generalization of rc in which the relay is both a source and a sink of data .",
    "hence , rcpm can be regarded as a generalization of pc - rbc wherein the relay is also a source of data and sends a private message to the destination .",
    "the rcpm model fits networks in which dedicated relays are not available , and relaying is performed by the nodes that each node is a source and a sink of data .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that rcpm is controlled by random parameters called channel state and we refer to it as state - dependent relay channel with private messages ( sd - rcpm ) .",
    "recently , state - dependent channels have attracted considerable attention . in these channels ,",
    "the information on the channel state can be known to the terminals causally or non - causally . for a comprehensive overview on state - dependent channels",
    "see @xcite .    among state - dependent multiuser models ,",
    "some results have also been obtained for the state - dependent rc ( sd - rc ) and state - dependent pc - rbc ( sd - pcrbc ) @xcite-@xcite for gaussian and discrete memoryless cases with causal or non - causal channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "since rcpm can be regarded as a generalization of rc and pc - rbc , the sd - rcpm can be regarded as a generalization of sd - rc and sd - pcrbc .    in this paper , after introducing sd - rcpm , we investigate two main cases : sd - rcpm with non - causal csi , and sd - rcpm with causal csi . in each case",
    ", we investigate sd - rcpm with partial csi at the source and the relay . as special cases it includes three different situations in which perfect csi is available i ) only at the source , ii ) only at the relay , and iii ) both at the source and the relay .",
    "situations i and ii called _ asymmetric _ scenarios refer to the cases in which csi is available only at some of the nodes .",
    "situation iii is called the _",
    "symmetric _ scenario .",
    "in fact in the asymmetric cases , it is assumed that only some of the nodes have the ability or the permission to know csi . in @xcite , unlike most of the previous works on sd - rc , we have used cf strategy @xcite for relaying in sd - rc , and showed that there exist cases ( similar to the classic rc ) for which cf scheme achieves rates higher than those derived using df strategy @xcite for sd - rc with asymmetric csi in @xcite .",
    "now , in this paper we also focus on cf relaying scheme .",
    "in fact similar to what is shown for classic rc , the cf and df are both able to outperform each other under different conditions . in df ( or partial",
    "df ) scheme , the relay has to decode the whole message intended for the destination ( or a part of it ) .",
    "therefore , when only the source is informed of csi , due to lack of knowledge of csi at the relay , the rate loss is caused at the relay as shown in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when only the relay is informed of csi , the source can not use csi and can not conceive what the relay exactly sends , and as shown in @xcite , this causes a loss in the coherence gain which is expected to be achieved by df relaying .",
    "however , df based rate can be optimal for certain cases as shown recently in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in cf strategy independent codebooks are exploited at the source and relay , and the relay simply compresses its received signal .",
    "also , cf outperforms df for relaying the message intended for the destination , when the link between the source and relay is worse than the direct link .    here ,",
    "for the non - causal situation , we derive an inner bound on the capacity region ( achievable rate region ) of sd - rcpm based on using gelfand - pinsker ( gp ) type coding @xcite at the nodes informed of csi , and using cf scheme at the relay .",
    "we derive an achievable rate region for sd - rcpm in the causal case using shannon s strategy @xcite and cf scheme .",
    "we show that our result for the causal case can be considered as a special case of non - causal csi , and this is in analogy with the relation between the capacity of the single user channel with causal csi @xcite , and its non - causal counterpart @xcite .",
    "we also show that our results subsume the results in @xcite which are for sd - rc , and the result in @xcite which is for rcpm ( state - independent ) , as special cases . as an example , we consider the gaussian version of sd - rcpm with additive independent identically distributed ( i.i.d ) state process , and obtain achievable rate region for the case where perfect csi is available non - causally only at the source .",
    "we also illustrate the trade - off between relayed message rate and private messages rates for this channel . since there is no available achievable region for sd - rcpm which is established based on df scheme , to compare df and cf strategies for this channel",
    ", we consider a scenario in which the relay sends no private message to the destination ( i.e. , sd - rcpm reduces to sd - pcrbc ) .",
    "for this scenario , we make a comparison between our cf based derived achievable region and the rate region derived in @xcite based on df .",

    "note that , for decoding at the relay there is no difference between causal and non - causal cases since the relay can wait until the end of the block , before decoding .",

    "[ th : noncausal ] in the discrete memoryless sd - rcpm with non - causal csi @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively at the source and the relay , the nonnegative rate tuples @xmath45 denoted as @xmath50 , satisfying : @xmath51 subject to the constraint    i(y_2;y_2,s_2,t_2|k_2,q_2,y_3 ) i(q_2;y_3|k_2)-i(q_2;s_2|k_2),[eq : condcfsourcerelaync ]    are achievable for any joint p.m.f of the form    & p(s , s_1,s_2,k_2,q_2,t_1,t_2,x_1,x_2,y_2,y_2,y_3)= + & p(s , s_1,s_2)p(k_2|s_2)p(q_2|k_2,s_2)p(x_2|q_2,k_2,s_2)p(t_1,t_2|s_1 ) + & p(x_1|t_1,t_2,s_1)p(y_2,y_3|x_1,x_2,s)p(y_2|y_2,q_2,k_2,s_2,t_2).[eq : pmfsourcerelaync ]    [ mk : cfsourcerelaync1 ] the relay which is the middle terminal , knows csi @xmath49 .",

    ", cf outperforms df in pc - rbc ( state - independent ) .",
    "so , in the state - dependent version of this channel it can outperform df which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] . in these examples , if @xmath192 is also increased , cf based bound becomes closer to its respective outer bound .",
    "note that for noise configuration where @xmath238 , it is clear that cf outperforms df , and to prevent having a messy figure this case is not depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "we remark that these power sets are chosen to have cases that can be presented in one figure .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for all these cases , maximum achievable @xmath230 ( when @xmath239 ) coincides with that of derived for pc - rbc ( state - independent ) , and this confirms that a complete state cancellation is performed for sending @xmath163 on the source - relay link for @xmath239 .",
    "we introduced sd - rcpm as a generalization of sd - rc and sd - pcrbc . in order to have a unified view ,",
    "both causal and non - causal cases were investigated . in each case , an achievable rate region for sd - rcpm with partial csi at the source and relay was derived using cf scheme .",
    "we also derived an achievable rate region for gaussian version of sd - rcpm with non - causal perfect csi only at the source . in ongoing work , we are using df scheme for both discrete memoryless and gaussian version of sd - rcpm with causal and non - causal csi .",
