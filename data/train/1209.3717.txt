    "that is , states satisfying @xmath97 for some @xmath98 , ( [ eq : bindabs2 ] ) gives the uniform lower bound @xmath99 which means a uniform upper bound on the radius of the multipolaron system .",
    "this bound depends only on the value of @xmath100 and does not explode as @xmath59 approaches the critical unbinding value .",
    "a similar phenomenon was shown by t. and m. hoffmann - ostenhof and b.  simon @xcite for a two - electron atom and the proof strategy of theorem [ thm : bindingn ] applies to that problem as well @xcite .",
    "the overall lesson is that this kind of discontinuous binding will occur whenever the net repulsion at large distances falls of slower than @xmath101 .",
    "the pekar  tomasevich approximation to the ground state energy @xmath102 consists in minimizing @xmath103 only over @xmath82 s of the form @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and both @xmath19 and @xmath107 are normalized . for @xmath108",

    "there is a considerable literature on the subject of rotation invariance of the bipolaron energy minimizer , usually formulated in the language of ` one - center bipolaron versus two - center bipolaron ' @xcite .",
    "the analyses are all based on variational calculations . while there seems to be general agreement that the one - center bipolaron has the lower energy , it is not completely clear that a more sophisticated variational treatment will preserve rotational symmetry , especially near the value of @xmath59 where the bipolaron ceases to be bound .",
    "the value of @xmath59 determined by physical electrostatic considerations is always @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless , one can consider the mathematical question for small , but positive @xmath59 and ask whether there is a possible lack of rotational invariance in that case . after all , a rotating object like the earth becomes oblate even for the smallest amount of rotation .",
    "our theorem @xcite says that for the bipolaron rotational symmetry is not broken for small @xmath59 :    [ thm : symm ] there is a @xmath121 such that for all @xmath122 the minimizer of @xmath123 is unique up to translations and multiplication by a constant phase .",
    "in particular , after a translation it is rotation invariant , that is , @xmath124 for any @xmath125 and any @xmath126 .",
    "our proof of theorem [ thm : symm ] is perturbative in nature .",
    "it uses crucially a non - degeneracy statement about the single polaron functional due to lenzmann @xcite .",
    "we also show that for certain values of @xmath127 the bipolaron equation has a positive solution which is _ not _ a minimizer .",
    "it remains an _ open problem _ to decide whether the ground state ceases to be rotation invariant for @xmath59 close to the critical value where bipolarons cease to be bound in the pekar  tomasevich approximation .",
