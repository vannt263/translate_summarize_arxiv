    "the formalism of open chaotic systems has been extensively used to describe lasing properties of two - dimensional optical cavities  @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach relies on the use of long - living ray trajectories to describe the lasing modes .",
    "this is justified because lasing modes are induced by the gain medium present in optical cavities and only long - living trajectories are able to profit from this gain .",
    "the relevance of gain led to specific investigations of its role in experiments  @xcite and wave simulations  @xcite , but we are not aware of ray simulations which have explicitly included gain .",

    "we call this phenomenon a _ chaotic explosion_.    in this letter we show that chaotic systems with gain can be treated with the same formalism of systems with absorption but that the properties of these two classes of systems can not be trivially related to each other .",
    "we obtain general results for the fractality and for the inverse map of systems with gain / absorption , which are illustrated analytically in the baker map and numerically in the cardioid billiard . for optical microcavities ,",
    "our results show how gain can be introduced in the ray description and how it affects the far - field emission , demonstrating also in the ray description that lasing is not determined by the shape of the ( passive ) cavity alone .",

    ", we find for @xmath45 a set of narrow `` columns '' in the unstable direction and narrow `` strips '' along the stable directions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.hyperbolic ] .",
    "they are good approximants of the unstable and stable foliation of the chaotic set ( a chaotic sea or an attractor in closed systems , or a chaotic saddle in open ones ) underlying the dynamics .",

    "let us focus on such an @xmath6-cycle point at the intersection of strip @xmath47 and column @xmath48 ( drawn with bold lines in fig .",

    "the width of column @xmath48 is approximately @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the contracting lyapunov exponent around the cycle point over discrete time @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , the height @xmath51 of strip @xmath47 is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the corresponding positive lyapunov exponent . by construction , points starting in strip @xmath47 spend the dominant part of their lifetime @xmath6 in the close _ vicinity of the hyperbolic cycle _ in question ( which belongs to the chaotic set ) .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath6 nearly all points in the strip are subjected to an average stretching factor @xmath54 ( in the unstable direction ) . in an extended map @xmath35 , obtained from @xmath3 through eq .",

    "valid for @xmath35 , the density on the images of strip @xmath47 is the density of strip @xmath47 multiplied ( in each iteration ) by a factor @xmath60 . starting with an initial unit density",
    ", the area @xmath61 of strip @xmath47 should be multiplied in @xmath35 by a factor @xmath62 by the end of @xmath6 iterations .",

    "their fractality requires thus the computation of the generalized dimensions  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the measure of the @xmath59-th box in a coverage with a uniform grid of box size @xmath70 , and the sum is over non - empty boxes .",
    "a general result can be obtained for the information dimension @xmath71 . for a general one - dimensional distribution containing measures",

    "( [ eq.mui ] ) , ( [ eq.muimuj ] ) in the @xmath71 formula above , we obtain the partial information dimension @xmath77 along the unstable direction as @xmath78 the averages denoted by overbars are taken over the chaotic set ( e.g. , @xmath79 is the positive lyapunov exponent on the saddle ) .",
    "this is so because , as argued above , the trajectory effectively experiences collision times @xmath12 , reflection coefficients  @xmath37 , and local lyapunov exponents @xmath80 ( of the usual map @xmath3 ) close to an unstable cycle ( which belongs to the chaotic set ) .",
    "quantities characterizing the map ( @xmath79 ) , the collision times ( @xmath81 ) , and the gain ( @xmath82 ) determine a fractal property ( @xmath71 ) via the simple relation  ( [ eq : d1 ] ) .",
    "fractality is nontrivial if @xmath83 , implying @xmath84 ( for a positive rate @xmath23 ) , i.e. , @xmath38 in a sufficiently extended region .    repeating the calculation along a section parallel to the stable foliation ( s ) we find @xmath85 , the partial information dimension along the stable direction .",
    "since the measures are the same ( see ( [ eq.muimuj ] ) ) , the difference follows from the sizes which are @xmath86 now , and we find @xmath87 the overall information dimension of the chaotic set with the measure of @xmath35 is @xmath88 .",

    "the solution of this apparent paradox is that the asymptotic densities of the forward @xmath2 and inverse @xmath111 maps differ .",

    ", the inverse map can be defined only as the limiting case of @xmath116 .      in a general system",
    "both gain and absorption coexist and a natural question is whether decay or explosion is observed globally .",
    "this is a priori unclear because of the non - trivial nature of the asymptotic density @xmath25 . when half of the phase space has @xmath117 and the other half @xmath118 as reflection coefficients one would intuitively expect for an ergodic system that a steady state is found with @xmath119 .",

    "<S> we investigate chaotic dynamical systems for which the intensity of trajectories might grow unlimited in time . </S>",
    "<S> we show that ( i ) the intensity grows exponentially in time and is distributed spatially according to a fractal measure with an information dimension smaller than that of the phase space , ( ii ) such exploding cases can be described by an operator formalism similar to the one applied to chaotic systems with absorption ( decaying intensities ) , but ( iii ) the invariant quantities characterizing explosion and absorption are typically not directly related to each other , e.g. , the decay rate and fractal dimensions of absorbing maps typically differ from the ones computed in the corresponding inverse ( exploding ) maps . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our general results through numerical simulation in the cardioid billiard mimicking a lasing optical cavity , and through analytical calculations in the baker map . </S>"
