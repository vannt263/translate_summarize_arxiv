    "the one - dimensional lieb - liniger model @xcite of interacting bosons is arguably the simplest bethe ansatz integrable model @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most extensively studied many - body models of cold atoms .",
    "experimental studies of cold bosonic atoms over a wide range of tunable interaction strength between atoms are in agreement with results obtained from the integrable model @xcite .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence of this system provides a further experimental test @xcite of integrable theory in the form of the yang - yang equation @xcite in the weak coupling regime .    in principle , the yang - yang method gives exact results for the thermodynamic properties of integrable many - body systems at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "however , depending on the particular model under investigation , the yang - yang method involves either a finite or an infinite number of coupled nonlinear integral equations , which hinders access to thermodynamic quantities from both the analytical and numerical points of view .",
    "it is a formidable task to extract exact low temperature results for many - body systems of this kind .",
    "here we further develop a polylog function method to derive the equation of state of homogeneous degenerate quantum gases of cold atoms in the framework of the tba formalism .",
    "the polylog function method has been recently applied to the one - dimensional attractive fermi gases of ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics and full phase diagrams can be calculated analytically via this approach .",
    "for example , for spin-1/2 attractive fermions , the universal tomonaga - luttinger liquid behaviour is readily identified from the pressure given in terms of polylog functions @xcite . here",
    "we investigate the thermodynamics of the lieb - liniger model for spinless bosons .",
    "the high precision of the equation of state obtained for strong interaction provides exact physical properties of this model at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "following @xcite , the universal tomonaga - luttinger liquid physics @xcite follows with the help of sommerfeld expansion in the low temperature limit .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that dynamical critical exponents and correlation exponents can be read off the universal scaling functions for thermodynamic properties of one - dimensional fermions . as we shall see below",
    ", the polylog function method is also accurate , simple and convenient in the study of thermodynamics and quantum criticality of one - dimensional bosons .",
    "the lieb - liniger model @xcite is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 in which @xmath1 spinless bosons , each of mass @xmath2 , are constrained by periodic boundary conditions on a line of length @xmath3 and @xmath4 is an effective one - dimensional coupling constant with scattering strength @xmath5 .",
    "we will be particularly interested in the low density case , i.e. the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 is finitely strong , where @xmath7 is the linear density .",
    "it was for this model that yang and yang @xcite introduced the particle hole ensemble to describe the thermodynamics of the model in equilibrium , which is later called the thermodynamics bethe ansatz ( tba ) , see @xcite . in terms of the dressed energy @xmath8 defined with respect to the quasimomentum @xmath9 at finite temperature @xmath10 , the yang - yang equation is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the chemical potential and @xmath13 is the bare dispersion .",
    "the dressed energy @xmath14 plays the role of excitation energy measured from the energy level @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the fermi - like momentum .",

    "lieb - liniger bosons behave like ideal particles obeying fractional statistics @xcite .",
    "the gas reaches the tonks - girardeau regime with two - particle local correlation @xmath34 . using the hellmann - feynman theorem , to leading orders the zero temperature two - particle local correlation follows as @xmath35 which agrees with the result obtained from form factors of the sine - gordon model in the non - relativistic limit @xcite .    turning to finite temperatures",

    "the results also allow exploration of the crossover from the universal luttinger liquid regime to the decoherent regime where the linear dispersion in the low - lying excitations is destroyed .",
    "considering the low temperature limit , i.e. @xmath44 , the pressure per unit length with fixed @xmath45 is , to leading orders in @xmath10 , given by @xmath46 which follows directly by sommerfeld expansion @xcite .",
    "here we have ignored higher order corrections than @xmath29 in the temperature - dependent terms . in the above result @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "are the pressure and chemical potential at zero temperature ( in units of @xmath33 ) @xmath49 moreover , to leading order , the free energy follows as @xmath50 where the central charge @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the ground state energy ( [ e ] ) and @xmath53 is the sound velocity . the result ( [ f - t ] )",
    "is as expected from conformal field theory arguments for a critical system , i.e. for a system with massless excitations .",
    "this implies that for temperatures below a crossover value @xmath54 , the low - lying excitations have a linear relativistic dispersion relation , i.e. of the form @xmath55 .",
    "if the temperature exceeds this crossover value , the excitations involve free quasiparticles with nonrelativistic dispersion .",
    "this crossover temperature can be identified from the breakdown of linear temperature - dependent specific heat .",
    "figure 2 indicates this universal crossover at a temperature @xmath56 ( in units of @xmath57 ) from a relativistic dispersion relation to a nonrelativistic dispersion .    for this simplest of models ,",
    "the chemical potential drives a quantum phase transition from a vacuum phase into a tomonaga - luttinger liquid phase at zero temperature .",
    "we now further refine the equation of state to map out the universal low temperature quantum phase diagram .",
    "for convenience in deriving the equation of state , we introduce an energy scale @xmath58 . equations ( [ pressure - polylog ] ) and ( [ eos - a ] ) can then be written in terms of the dimensionless quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 as @xmath61   \\label{eos - e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",

    "near the critical point @xmath67 we find the density obeys the universal scaling form @xcite @xmath68 for which the scaling function is @xmath69 for @xmath70 . here",
    "the background density in the vacuum is @xmath71 . for this model , we find that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus the critical exponent @xmath74 and the correlation length exponent @xmath75 with system dimension @xmath76 can all be read off the universal scaling form ( [ n ] ) . meanwhile , the compressibility satisfies the scaling form @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the equation of state ( [ eos - e ] ) has been used to plot the universal low temperature quantum phase diagram in figure 3 .",
    "the vacuum state and the tomonaga - luttinger liquid persist below the two cross - over temperatures .",
    "they both vanish at the quantum critical point , as described by the scaling functions . following zhou and ho @xcite , the scaling functions for the density and compressibility can be used to map out the criticality of ultracold bosonic atoms in experiments .",
    "figure 4 shows the detection of quantum criticality near @xmath80 using either the density or compressibility curves .",
    "we see clearly that such curves intersect at the critical potential @xmath67 , indicative of scaling .",
    "as highlighted in the introduction , the motivation for the present work on one - dimensional bosons was the successful application of the polylog function method to the one - dimensional attractive fermi gases @xcite of ultracold atoms up to order @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "our key results are the equation of state ( [ eos - e ] ) and the scaling forms ( [ n ] ) and ( [ kappa ] ) for the density and compressibility .",
    "the resulting low - temperature quantum phase diagram in figure 3 is the simplest possible quantum criticality for quantum many - body systems .    in general ,",
    "the polylog function method is widely applicable to one - dimensional many - body systems with quadratic bare dispersion or linear bare dispersion @xmath82 in both attractive and repulsive regimes .",
    "the analytical polylog function method can thus play an important role in unifying the properties of attractive fermi gases of ultracold atoms with higher symmetries .",
    "for example , the yang - yang method applied to the one - dimensional fermi gas with attractive @xmath83-function interaction and internal spin degrees of freedom leads to equations which may be reformulated according to the charge bound states and spin strings characterizing spin fluctuations @xcite . for strong attraction ,",
    "the spin fluctuations that couple to non spin - neutral charge bound states are exponentially small and can be asymptotically calculated @xcite . thus the low energy physics is dominated by density fluctuations among the charge bound states .",
    "the full phase diagrams and thermodynamics of the one - dimensional attractive fermi gases can be analytically calculated with relative ease using this polylog function method .",
    "for example , for spin-1/2 attractive fermions , the universal tomonaga - luttinger liquid behaviour was identified from the pressure given in terms of polylog functions @xcite . here",
    "we further extend the results obtained using this approach .    following the procedure described in the previous section ,",
    "we obtain the pressure @xmath84 from the tba equations for spin-1/2 attractive fermions @xcite .",
    "the superscripts @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote bound pairs and excess fermions . for studying quantum criticality of 1d attractive fermi gas @xcite , a high precision equation of state",
    "is highly desirable . to this end ,",

    "one can compare with and fit the experimental results obtained recently for trapped one - dimensional spin-1/2 fermions at rice university @xcite .",
    "indeed , the experimental results confirm the expected phase diagram @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for one - dimensional fermi gases with repulsive interaction @xcite , we understand that antiferromagnetic effective spin - spin interaction directly couples to the charge degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "this triggers a spin - charge separated field theory of a tomonaga - luttinger liquid and an antiferromagnetic @xmath96 heisenberg spin chain . with the help of wiener - hopf techniques and polylog functions ,",
    "we also can obtain a high precision equation of state for such one - dimensional repulsive fermi gases @xcite .",
    "the application of this approach to the study of thermodynamics of other one - dimensional degenerate bose and fermi gases , such as the spinor bose gases and to mixtures of bosons and fermions , is also relatively straight forward .    in general the equation of state",
