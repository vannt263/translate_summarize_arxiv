    "sn 1987a has provided us with an excellent opportunity to test the theory of massive star evolution , nucleosynthesis , and supernova explosion . the broad band photometric observations , ranging from ultraviolet to far - infrared , and the resultant bolometric light curve enable us to probe the physical processes occurring in the interior of sn 1987a .",
    "the light curve is so sensitive to the hydrodynamics that it is a useful tool to infer the progenitor s radius , the distribution of elements , mass of the ejecta ( in particular , the mass of the hydrogen - rich envelope , @xmath13 ) , and the explosion energy , @xmath14 ( e.g. , nomoto 1994 for a review ) .",
    "although earlier theoretical models with flux - limited diffusion approximation are generally in good agreement with observations ( see , e.g. , arnett 1989a , and @xcite for a review ) , there are still some uncertainties .",
    "one of the most important complications is that the supernova atmosphere is scattering dominated so that the color temperature is much higher than the effective temperature ; the spectrum is a superposition of spectra emerging from layers with different depths and temperatures ( imshennik & utrobin 1977 ; shigeyama 1987 ; pizzochero 1990 ; hflich & wheeler 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "this effect is crucial to include in order to constrain model parameters .",
    "previous works on modeling this effect have used supernova atmospheric codes which rely either on the temperature structure derived from equilibrium diffusion models ( hflich 1991 ) , or on the time - dependent luminosity from one - group radiation - hydro models ( hauschildt & ensman 1994 ) . to produce light curves ,",
    "the latter work also used the temperature structure prescribed by the one - group radiation - hydro results . in the present work we attempt to solve the problem of a scattering dominated supernova envelope doing all calculations time - dependently .",
    "we calculate the temperature structure self - consistently , and we do not make assumptions on the radiative equilibrium which is strongly violated during the shock breakout .",
    "we analyze the light curve of sn 1987a with a multi - group radiation hydrodynamics code called stella ( @xcite ) . the calculated broad band ( @xmath15 , _ iue _ uv ) and bolometric light curves are compared with observations for the first @xmath16 months after core collapse . from this",
    "we update the constraints on model parameters such as the explosion energy and the extent of mixing .    we discuss the uncertainties in our predictions due to nlte effects ( which are not included in our modeling ) by comparing with nlte atmospheric calculations done by other authors .",
    "we believe that those uncertainties can be bracketed for the first months of sn 1987a light by two extreme assumptions on the scattering of photons in spectral lines .",
    "it is found that the predictions for the first hours and days are fairly insensitive to the assumptions on spectral lines , because of the overwhelming dominance of electron scattering .",
    "so , for those epochs we produce reliable predictions for the soft x - ray / extreme uv flash of the supernova .",
    "earlier modeling of the light curve of sn 1987a has adopted the following types of numerical approaches :    1 .",
    "equilibrium - diffusion radiation hydrodynamics , with a flux - limiter to ensure a smooth transition from diffusion to free - streaming regimes ( shigeyama et al .",
    "1987 ; arnett 1987 , 1988 ; @xcite ; woosley 1988 ; @xcite ) . here _",
    "equilibrium _ means _ one - temperature _ approximation where the radiation and gas have the same temperature",
    ". local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) is assumed , and black body spectra are used to obtain monochromatic broad - band light curves .",
    "non - equilibrium , one - energy group ( gray ) radiation hydrodynamics , where equilibrium between the gas and the radiation is no longer assumed ( i.e. , _ two - temperature _ transfer ) .",
    "lte is assumed and a diluted black body approximation is used for the monochromatic light curves ( ensman & burrows 1992 ; mair 1992 ) .",
    "3 .   multi - energy group ( non - gray ) atmospheric codes combined with gray radiation hydrodynamics . here",
    "the atmospheric structures , i.e. , the distributions of temperature , density , and velocity at @xmath17 are obtained from the gray hydro code described above ( hflich 1991 ; hauschildt & ensman 1994 ) and the emerging spectra are computed taking into account nlte effects .",
    "full multi - energy group radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "this is the approach in our study , and the code we have used is called stella ( blinnikov & bartunov 1993 ; blinnikov 1998 ) ; a detailed description of new technical features of the code is given in sorokina , blinnikov , & nomoto ( 1999 ) .",
    "lte for ionization and atomic level populations is assumed .",
    "solves the time - dependent equations for the angular moments of intensity averaged over fixed frequency bands , using up to 300 zones for the lagrangean coordinate and up to 100 frequency bins ( i.e. , energy groups ) .",
    "this high number of frequency groups allows one to have a reasonably accurate representation of non - equilibrium continuum radiation .",
    "there is no need to ascribe any temperature to the radiation : the photon energy distribution can be quite arbitrary .",
    "the coupling of multi - group radiative transfer with hydrodynamics means that we can obtain the color temperature in a self - consistent calculation , and that no additional estimates of thermalization depth as in the one - energy group model of ensman & burrows ( 1992 ) are needed .",
    "variable eddington factors are computed , which fully take into account scattering and redshifts for each frequency group in each mass zone .",
    "the gamma - ray transfer is calculated using a one - group approximation for the non - local deposition of the energy of radioactive nuclei . here",
    "we follow swartz , sutherland , & harkness ( 1995 ; see also jeffery 1998 ) , and we only use a purely absorptive opacity .",
    "this should be a good approximation . in the equation of state ,",
    "lte ionizations and recombinations are taken into account .",
    "the effect of line opacity is treated as an expansion opacity according to the prescription of eastman & pinto ( 1993 ; see also blinnikov et al .",
    "their approach is different from that of shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) who used rosseland mean opacities for scattering and absorption processes , where the line opacities were assumed to be 0.009 and 0.01 @xmath18 g@xmath19 for helium and heavier elements , respectively",
    "( los alamos opacity library ) .",
    "our opacities are also different from those in other equilibrium - diffusion or one - group radiation hydro models , since instead of one single energy - averaged opacity we need opacities for all our energy groups .",
    "we have studied two progenitor models in some detail : the evolutionary model of nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) and saio , nomoto , & kato ( 1988b ) ( see also @xcite ; saio , kato , & nomoto 1988a ) , and the non - evolutionary model of utrobin ( 1993 ) . here",
    "we concentrate on the model studied by nomoto and co - workers .",
    "the results for utrobin s model ( which gives one of the best fits to the bolometric light of sn 1987a among the equilibrium diffusion models ) are presented elsewhere .    in the evolutionary model ,",
    "a star with the initial mass @xmath20 = 23 @xmath21 and low metallicity @xmath22 = 0.005 is evolved from the main - sequence and onwards , with the schwarzschild criterion applied for convection . during the evolution from blue to red ,",
    "the stellar mass decreases to 16.3 @xmath23 and a helium core of = 6.7 @xmath23 is formed . during the red phase ,",
    "0.7 @xmath23 of helium is mixed out into the hydrogen - rich envelope yielding = 6.0 @xmath23 and @xmath13 = 10.3 @xmath23 .",
    "the dredge up of the helium enhances the surface helium abundance to @xmath24 = 0.43 , which is large enough to move the star in hr - diagram from the red to the location of sk  69@xmath25202 in the blue .",
    "the resultant luminosity and radius are  = @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath2  = 48.5 , respectively .",
    "because the radius of the progenitor is not well constrained in the evolutionary model , we have also constructed a hydrostatic envelope model with a radius of @xmath2  = 40   and of @xmath2  = 58   which are fitted to the evolved 6   he core .",
    "the 6   he core was evolved through the iron core collapse ( nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ) .",
    "the resultant explosion and explosive nucleosynthesis were calculated as in hashimoto , nomoto , & shigeyama ( 1989 ) and thielemann , hashimoto , & nomoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "we have assumed in all our models ( i.e. , irrespective of the explosion energy ) that the mass cut is located at @xmath28 = 1.6 , so that the mass of the ejecta is @xmath29 .",
    "following shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) we denote our standard model 14e1 .",
    "various suffixes have been added to distinguish between different models which have different explosion energies and initial radii , as well as other different physical properties .    for our multi - group computation",
    "it is inconvenient to use the initial evolutionary 14e1 model directly . instead",
    ", the star was constructed in hydrostatic equilibrium in the same way as was done in blinnikov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for sn 1993j : as we need a much finer zoning in the outer layers in our calculations than was used in nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) and saio et al .",
    "( 1988b ) , a remap of the original model was done onto another grid .",
    "we assume that at the outer boundary ( i.e. , at @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the total mass of the star ) the material pressure vanishes , @xmath32 , and that there is no radiation coming from the outside .",
    "the density structure found in this way is shown in figure  [ nommxfrho ] .",
    "the density of the free blue wind is only @xmath33 g @xmath34 when scaled as @xmath35 from @xmath36 cm and inward to @xmath37 cm ( lundqvist 1999 ) .",
    "this falls outside the plot in figure 1 . as the shock wave propagates through the star ,",
    "the interfaces where the composition changes suddenly from c+o dominated to helium dominated , and then further out to hydrogen - dominated , are strongly rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "this induces mixing of the material before the shock breakout at the surface ( e.g. , @xcite , hachisu 1990 , 1991 , @xcite ) . particularly important for the light curve behavior",
    "is the mixing of hydrogen down to the central region .",
    "mixing of @xmath38ni into the hydrogen - rich envelope also affects the light curve , and is decisive for spectral ( @xcite ) and x - ray observations .",
    "the mixed abundance distribution in figure  [ nommxfchm ] is inferred from the comparison of the x - ray and @xmath39-ray light curves and spectra with observations ( kumagai et al .",
    "the outermost mixed @xmath38ni corresponds to the velocity @xmath40 /kms in the best fitting model of the light curve ( see fig .",
    "[ 14e1vchm ] below ) .",
    "the mixing is artificial , since 2d modeling failed to distribute @xmath38ni further out than @xmath41 /kms",
    "( hachisu .",
    "1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "the density profile was only marginally changed by the mixing .",
    "we have tested explosion energies in the range @xmath42 ergs and named the runs 14e0.7 , 14e1 , 14e1.3 , ... , etc . , where ` 14 ' denotes the ejecta mass in solar units , see table  [ runs ] .",
    "all models in the runs labeled without the suffix ` u ' have the mixed composition shown in figure  [ nommxfchm ] already prior to the model explosion .",
    "each model was exploded by the deposition of heat energy in a layer of mass @xmath43  outside of 1.6 . since stella",
    "does not include nuclear burning , preservation of the same mixed composition in the ejecta is assured .",
    "the explosion energies given above refers to the asymptotic kinetic energy of ejecta .",
    "the heat energy injected for a simulated explosion is higher by @xmath44 ergs , i.e. , by the gravitational binding energy for the presupernova model .",
    "a small fraction ( @xmath45 ergs ) goes to the photon energy which is radiated away . for other models , 14e1u , and 14e1.2u , the unmixed composition in figure  [ unmxchm ]",
    "was used , and in 14e1a , we treated the opacity as pure absorption for the same total extinction ( which , however , is often dominated by scattering in reality ) . for the latter model the entry for `` forced @xmath46 '' is `` yes '' , i.e. , @xmath46 was artificially set equal to the total extinction .",
    "the suffix ` h ' denotes the model having the same density structure as the standard one , 14e1 , but the abundance of hydrogen in the outer layers is enhanced to the solar value .",
    "the suffix ` r ' is added for the models with non - standard initial radius ( see table  [ runs ] ) .",
    "some other models from the table  [ runs ] are discussed below .",
    "the shock wave arrives at the surface of the star at time @xmath47 , which for different values of the initial radius @xmath2 , the ejected mass @xmath48 , and explosion energy @xmath14 , could be approximated by :    @xmath49^{1\\over 2 } { \\rm hours } \\ ; . \\label{tprop}\\ ] ]    this expression is consistent with shigeyama ( 1987 ) .",
    "we compare the estimate ( [ tprop ] ) with computations in figure  [ tmre ] .",
    "the change in the velocity profile in figure  [ nomv ] shows how the materials are accelerated near the shock breakout until they reach homologous expansion .",
    "the maximum velocity at the outer edge is @xmath50  for 14e1 ( which is somewhat lower than for 14e1.3 in figure  [ nomv ] ) .",
    "further acceleration is limited by the inefficiency of the radiative precursor of the shock ( see a semi - analytic approach reviewed by nadyozhin 1994 ; see also imshennik & nadyozhin 1988 ) .",
    "we will discuss the influence of various assumptions on the maximum velocity and other details of shock breakout elsewhere .",
    "here we just note that velocities of the order @xmath51  are in very good agreement with the value found from the absorption feature of mg  ii  @xmath522800 in the early _ iue _ spectra ( @xcite ) .",
    "this has important implications for our understanding of the density structure of the circumstellar medium of the supernova ( chevalier 1999 ; lundqvist 1999 ) .",
    "more specifically , it indicates that the density of the blue supergiant wind must have been very low , corresponding to a mass loss rate of only @xmath53 .    the density distribution in the outer part is well approximated by a power law @xmath54 as found in shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) , but the very outermost layers are much steeper ( see fig .  [ rholgr ] ) .",
    "in between there is a dense shell , which was also found in non - equilibrium radiation hydrodynamic modeling ( @xcite ) , but missed in the equilibrium diffusion modeling .",
    "note that the density in the central parts computed by stella is much smoother than shown in figure  6 by shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "after the shock breakout , the early light curve up to @xmath55 25 days is powered by the diffusive release of the internal energy of the radiation field that is established by the shock wave .",
    "the bolometric light curve reaches its maximum luminosity of @xmath56 ( 49 ) @xmath57 ergs s@xmath19 ( table [ earlight ] and fig .",
    "[ nommxftphea ] ) immediately after shock breakout , and then drops rapidly by many orders of magnitude in @xmath7  days .",
    "the total energy radiated during the first two days amounts to @xmath58 ergs ( table [ earlight ] ) , but most of the radiation is emitted in a soft x - ray / euv burst , and was not observed .",
    "however , the burst had the important effect that it ionized the surrounding gas ( e.g. , lundqvist & fransson 1996 ; sonneborn et al .",
    "1997 ; lundqvist 1999 ) .",
    "the resultant ionization of the circumstellar material is commented on briefly in  7.1 , and will be compared with the observations in greater detail in lundqvist , blinnikov , & bartunov ( 1999a ) .",
    "after the burst , the ejecta expand so rapidly that the interior temperature ( both of the matter and radiation ) decreases almost adiabatically as @xmath59 . as a result , the bolometric luminosity decreases sharply to @xmath56 ( 2  3 ) ergs s@xmath19 to form a minimum of the bolometric light curve .",
    "figure  [ 14elum3 ] demonstrates that the model with @xmath60  ergs ( i.e , 14e1 ) gives the best agreement with the observed bolometric flux .",
    "note that the agreement for 14e1 is much better than in figure  7 of @xcite ) .",
    "( note also the higher resolution in our figure than in the figure of @xcite ) .",
    "the light curves computed by the flux - limited diffusion in shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) produce a short plateau , @xmath58 20 days ( see figs .  16  19 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is neither seen in the observations , nor in our models .",
    "the light curves computed here by the full radiative transport are in better agreement with observations for _ the same models _ ( cf . fig .  [ 14elum3 ] ) suggesting that the more accurate method of modeling gives results which are closer to reality .",
    "the luminosity at this phase is lower than for typical type ii - p supernovae by a factor of 10  20 .",
    "this is due to the small initial radius which leads to a low luminosity because a much larger fraction of the radiation field energy is lost by @xmath61d@xmath5 work than in ordinary type ii - p supernovae .",
    "this is well - known from early modeling of low - luminosity type ii - p supernovae ( @xcite ; chevalier 1976 ) . for sn 1987a",
    ", the low luminosity was successfully demonstrated in the models of shigeyama ( 1987 ) , arnett ( 1987 ) , grasberg ( 1987 ) , woosley ( 1988 ) , woosley , pinto , & eastman ( 1988 ) and utrobin ( 1993 ) .    in figure",
    "[ nommxftphea ] , we show the changes in the _ color _ temperature , @xmath62 , of the best blackbody fit to the flux , along with the effective temperature , @xmath63 , defined by the luminosity and the radius of last scattering @xmath64 through @xmath65 ( see blinnikov , 1998 , for details of finding @xmath64 and from that @xmath63 ) .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath62 is @xmath66  k for model 14e1 ( see table [ earlight ] ) , which is higher than the @xmath67 k in hflich s ( 1991 ) nlte time - dependent calculation for 14e1.25 , but similar to the temperatures found by ensman & burrows ( 1992 ) .",
    "our results are in very good agreement with the estimates of imshennik & nadyozhin ( 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "we emphasize that our multi - group radiative transfer with hydrodynamics obtains this temperature in a self - consistent way , and no additional estimates of the thermalization depth ( like in the one - group model of ensman & burrows 1992 ) are needed .",
    "the large difference between color and effective temperatures is due to scattering ( e.g. , sobolev 1980 ; kolesov & sobolev 1982 ; hflich 1991 ; wagoner & montes 1993 ) ; the average energy of the photons is higher than that corresponding to the value of @xmath63 .",
    "the effect is a deficit of photons in the visual at maximum light compared to a model with forced absorption ( fig .",
    "[ max1st ] ) .",
    "this effect continues throughout the first day after shock breakout . in figure  [ scaabs ]",
    "we demonstrate the dominance of scattering in extinction for high temperatures .",
    "figure  [ 14etph3 ] shows @xmath62 for the same three runs as in figure  [ 14elum3 ] , and one can see that @xmath62 is rather insensitive to @xmath14 ( except for the maximum @xmath62 at shock breakout , as displayed in table  [ earlight ] ) .    during the first day , the visual luminosity increases because the intensity peak is rapidly shifted into the optical due to the decreasing photospheric temperature . in order for the optical flare - up of the supernova to be seen at 6 mag at @xmath68 h , the condition @xmath69 h ( eqn .",
    "[ 1 ] ) should be satisfied , which requires a relatively large @xmath70 and small @xmath2 ( shigeyama 1987 ; woosley et al .",
    "also , the ejecta and the radiation field should have expanded rapidly so that the radiation temperature becomes lower and the radius of the photosphere becomes larger sufficiently fast .",
    "therefore , the expansion velocity , and thus @xmath70 , should be larger than certain values for a given initial radius .",
    "figure  [ vearly ] shows the @xmath5 light curve for the model 14e1.21 with realistic scattering dominated opacity for the first hours of sn 1987a . here ,",
    "and for other models below , we have used a distance modulus of 18.5 .",
    "( see walker 1999 , for a discussion on the uncertainty of this value . )",
    "we note that the @xmath5 curve exhibits an early local minimum which does not exist in equilibrium diffusion models ( e.g. , @xcite ; a small minimum was found also by @xcite ) .",
    "hflich ( 1991 ) ascribed this to a non - lte effect , and used the location in time of the minimum to constrain @xmath14 .",
    "however , we too recover the local minimum despite our lte approach .",
    "the reason for the minimum is that when the bolometric flux continues to fall ( fig .",
    "9 ) after shock breakout , the bolometric correction overcomes the effect of the falling bolometric flux .",
    "the visual luminosity then increases because the intensity peak is rapidly shifted into the optical due to the decreasing photospheric temperature .",
    "regardless of the exact cause of the difference between our and hflich s results on the one hand , and equilibrium diffusion models on the other , the first maximum in @xmath5 in our models is just on the level of jones limit ( @xcite ) even for our 14e1.3 run , where the energy of explosion is @xmath71 ergs higher ( see table [ runs ] ) than the model 14e1.25 used by hflich ( 1991 ; see also hflich & wheeler 1999 ) .",
    "the earlier appearance of the peak of the @xmath5-flux in our run is due to this higher energy .",
    "compared with observations , and especially the first @xmath5 observation by mcnaught & zoltowski ( 1987 ; later revised by west & mcnaught 1992 ) , the calculated @xmath5 curve in figure  [ vearly ] rises too slowly . in equilibrium diffusion modeling ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "the @xmath5 flux rises much faster .",
    "the reason for this difference is that equilibrium diffusion models do not care whether the total extinction is absorptive or due to scattering .",
    "the spectra are assumed in those models to be blackbody with the temperature equal to @xmath63 .",
    "this is not a good approximation , since in reality the thermalization of photons takes place well below the surface of the last scattering resulting in @xmath72 . in our run 14e1a",
    "we have assumed purely absorptive extinction , i.e. , we force even the electron scattering to act as true absorption so that the thermalization of the photons occurs at an optical depth of order unity .",
    "we thereby reproduce the results obtained in equilibrium diffusion models . as a matter of fact",
    ", the @xmath5 curve in 14e1a rises even faster than was observed .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ nommxfea ] which shows the @xmath15 light curves for 14e1 and 14e1a for the first 5 days .",
    ") there is of course no physical reason why electron scattering should be treated as absorptive . from this",
    "it is clear that that an accurate treatment of scattering is crucial to constrain @xmath14 .",
    "we will discuss this now .",
    "hflich ( 1991 ) was the first to show that non - equilibrium effects influence the @xmath5 light curve of sn 1987a drastically ; the flux in @xmath5 is @xmath73 magnitudes lower for the first hours than in the equilibrium gray atmosphere case .",
    "hflich ( 1991 ) tried a higher explosion energy than in 14e1 of shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) to compensate for this reduction of flux by adopting the model 14e1.25 computed in the flux - limited equilibrium diffusion approximation by shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "he then found a marginal agreement with the first data points of mcnaught & zoltowski ( 1987 ) .",
    "the same results have since been presented in hflich & wheeler ( 1999 ) . compared with our @xmath5",
    "light curve of 14e1.21 and 14e1.3 ( see figs .  [ vearly ] and [ eashv2 ] ) the rise of the @xmath5 curve in hflich s ( 1991 ) 14e1.25 model is significantly faster . to clarify this discrepancy",
    ", one should note that hflich used the temperature structure of an equilibrium diffusion model , which can be appreciably different from that in our full transport models .",
    "we can not say with certainty that this fully explains why our results and those of hflich differ so much .",
    "it could be due to that the expansion opacity should be treated differently in the energy equation than is described in hflich ( 1990 ; see blinnikov 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "there are , of course , uncertainties also in our models .",
    "in particular , the role of nlte effects needs to be further examined , but we can not envisage that they are able to explain the big difference between us and hflich ( 1991 ) for the first hours after shock breakout . at this epoch",
    "the extinction is totally dominated by electron scattering and spectral lines are not so important , see figure  [ scaabs ] .",
    "we see virtually no difference in our results for the first day when we treat the lines as fully absorptive , or as totally scattering dominated .",
    "the nlte effects set in later , and are very important after a couple of weeks ( cf .",
    "we are therefore confident that our results for this epoch are more accurate than hflich s ( 1991 ) .",
    "we note that even hflich s @xmath5-flux is lower than the observed after the new reductions by west & mcnaught ( 1992 ) .",
    "a possible explanation to the discrepancy between models and observations is that the stars , used to calibrate the early plates of the supernova by west & mcnaught ( 1992 ) , are too cool for an object with a color temperature of @xmath74k .",
    "( we find at @xmath75 day that @xmath76  k for the runs 14e0.7 , 14e1 , and 14e1.3 , respectively . )",
    "the temperature at @xmath75 days decreases with increasing explosion energy because of the earlier emergence of the shock and the faster adiabatic cooling . it should be emphasized that our models are much hotter than equilibrium diffusion models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and a comparison between observations and our results is therefore more sensitive to calibration errors than are equilibrium diffusion models . as we will see in  6.1 our models fit the early _ iue _ observations well , and since these observations are less likely to have the same error , we can not exclude calibration errors to be the cause of the mismatch in @xmath5 .",
    "_ this would mean that the early true @xmath5 flux was lower than hitherto believed_. we point out that we have changed various parameters in our models to try to make our @xmath5 flux increase faster and thereby fit the observations better .",
    "these experiments included enhancing the iron abundance , and varying the explosion energy and presupernova model within the limits allowed by the global light curve .",
    "however , none of these attempts reduced the discrepancy .",
    "( see , e.g. , the results for two different initial radii in fig . [ eashv2 ] . )",
    "after the minimum around day @xmath58 10 , the observed bolometric light curve showed an almost exponential increase up to day @xmath58 60 , and subsequently formed a plateau - like broad peak around day @xmath58 100 . after a relatively rapid drop , the luminosity then declined slowly between @xmath77 = 120  400 days at the rate of -decay .",
    "the energy source responsible for the broad peak of the light curve , and the tail , is therefore without doubt the radioactive decay of @xmath78 @xmath78  .",
    "the total mass of initial  in our models is @xmath79 , which is the same mass as in the models of shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "the theoretical bolometric light curves for models 14e1 , 14e1 m , and 14e1u with a different extent of mixing are shown in figure  [ nommxfbol ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the shape of the modeled light curve is strongly dependent on the distribution of hydrogen and  in the ejecta , i.e. , the amount of mixing that has occurred .    for the model with standard mixing ( 14e1 with @xmath38ni mixed out to @xmath80 4000 , fig .  [ 14e1vchm ] ) , there is significant heating of the outer layers due to radioactivity .",
    "the heating becomes noticeable in the light curve already at @xmath7  days , and then forms a smooth increase in the optical light curve up to the peak , as observed .",
    "for the unmixed model 14e1u ( figs .",
    "[ unmxchm ] , [ 14e1uvch ] ) , the shape of its bolometric light curve starts to differ from that of 14e1 already at @xmath58 10  days .",
    "for the unmixed case , the increase in the luminosity due to radioactive heating is delayed until @xmath81 days , which causes a dip to appear in the light curve around day 30 , and makes the light curve in the subsequent phase rise faster than in the mixed model",
    ". these properties are clearly incompatible with the observations .    for the case with intermediate mixing ( 14e1 m ) ,  is mixed out to @xmath80 2500 , while hydrogen is mixed as in the mixed model 14e1 ( fig .",
    "[ 14e1uvch ] ) . also in this model",
    "the appearance of radioactive heating occurs too late to be compatible with observations ( see fig .  [ nommxfbol ] ) .",
    "this suggests that mixing of  out to @xmath80 4000  is needed .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the radiation transfer scheme used ( nomoto , shigeyama , & hashimoto 1987 ; woosley 1988 ; shigeyama 1988 ) .",
    "the mixing out to large velocities is also supported by the redshifted feature at @xmath82  observed by haas et al .",
    "( 1990 ; see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we note , however , that utrobin ( 1993 ) obtains a good bolometric light curve without  mixing , and that kozma & fransson ( 1998a , b ) do not need to mix nickel out to more than @xmath58 2000  to model iron line profiles at late epochs .",
    "we postpone a more detailed discussion on mixing to a future paper .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the results of our non - equilibrium radiative transfer modeling by stella with the models in figures  16  19 of shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) .",
    "one striking difference , already noted above , is that the shape of the minimum near day 10 is reproduced much better with our non - equilibrium modeling .",
    "another difference is that the shape of the light curve around maximum ( at @xmath83 months ) is smoother in models with realistic scattering opacity ( see fig .",
    "[ bol3en ] below ) , than in models with forced absorption like 14e1a ( see fig .  [ nommxfabbol ] ) , and hence also in equilibrium diffusion models since the latter two types of model are closely related .",
    "these two models also show the same postmaximum sharp decline ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which can be understood in terms of enhanced emission according to kirchoff s law .",
    "we note that the rising part of the light curve is modeled better with enhanced absorption in spectral lines than with scattering lines ( see fig .",
    "[ nommxfabbol ] for the bolometric luminosity , and figs .",
    "[ 14e1ubv ] , [ 14e1subv ] for @xmath15 colors ) .",
    "this can perhaps be explained by nlte effects . in particular",
    ", the effect of fluorescence could be important ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this can not be studied directly by stella , but , as found by baron et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , forced absorption in spectral lines can reproduce some properties of the fluorescence as fluorescence is a form of thermalization ; spectra of lte models with absorptive lines are very similar to full nlte spectra , while lte models with scattering lines are far from reality ( see also eastman 1997 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this hints why the rising part is modeled well when we apply forced absorption in lines .",
    "another cause for the deviation of the rising part of the light curve from what was observed could be that the distribution of hydrogen is different from that in our model .",
    "this effect was investigated by utrobin ( 1993 ) .",
    "the hydrogen distribution affects the light curve because it determines how the hydrogen recombination front propagates into the ejecta ( e.g. , nadyozhin 1994 ; shigeyama & nomoto 1990 ) . because electron scattering is the main source of opacity , the opacity decreases sharply in the outward direction at the recombination front .",
    "this causes the photosphere to become associated with the recombination front .",
    "when the ejecta pass through this front their temperature quickly decreases to @xmath84 k. this is seen as a change in the temperature profile in figures  [ settm ] and [ settr ] .",
    "one can locate the photosphere in figure  [ settm ] at the point where the radiation temperature starts to deviate from the material temperature appreciably .",
    "we note that the recombination front is much broader than that in shigeyama & nomoto ( 1990 ) because of the large contribution of line opacity to the total opacity in our calculations .",
    "the effects of non - equilibrium transport are also important for the width of the recombination front .",
    "as seen in figures  [ settm ] and [ setlm ] the photosphere propagates inward in mass , while the material expands outward . for a certain period ,",
    "the recombination front is almost stationary in radius ( figure  [ settr ] ) .",
    "if @xmath63 were constant , then this would result in an almost constant bolometric luminosity , i.e. , in a perfect plateau of the light curve , where the duration of the plateau stage depends on how deep into the star hydrogen has been mixed . for a deeper mixing of hydrogen",
    ", the plateau lasts longer .",
    "when the photosphere enters into layers which lack sufficient amounts of hydrogen , the hydrogen recombination front disappears and the plateau phase is terminated . this is the case for typical type ii - p supernovae , where radioactive heating does not show up until the very end of the plateau stage ( eastman et al .",
    "sn 1987a is quite different in this respect , since radioactivity is important also at early epochs ; the diffusion flux from the radioactive energy release starts to dominate over the diffusion flux from the recombination of hydrogen already at @xmath85 weeks after the explosion .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ setlm ] ( cf .",
    "12 in @xcite , and fig .  11 in @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between the duration of the plateau phase and the depth of the hydrogen layer can be given more quantitatively .",
    "suppose that hydrogen is mixed down to a shell where the expansion velocity of the hydrogen - rich layer is @xmath86 .",
    "then this velocity is related to the observed quantities for the plateau phase as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the time at the end of the plateau , @xmath89 the luminosity at @xmath90 , and @xmath91 5500 k because of the association of the photosphere with the hydrogen recombination front .",
    "the time @xmath77 is for the freely expanding ejecta , @xmath92 .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath93 ergs s@xmath19 , and @xmath94 days , as in the unmixed model 14e1u ( fig .  [ nommxfbol ] ) , we find from eqn.([vh ] ) @xmath95 which is in good agreement with figure  [ 14e1uvch ] .    in the standard model , 14e1",
    ", hydrogen is mixed down to @xmath96 , i.e. , only @xmath97 outside @xmath98 .",
    "the expansion velocity at that radius is only @xmath58 1000 . if we adopt @xmath99 days , eqn .",
    "[ vh ] gives @xmath100 1300 km s@xmath19 as is required from observations .",
    "equation ( [ vh ] ) thus appears to give a reasonable estimate of @xmath86 when we put @xmath88 equal to the time when the second maximum ends .",
    "however , we caution that this result should not be overinterpreted .",
    "equation ( 2 ) gives the photospheric velocity as long as @xmath63 is 5500 k , which is roughly the case for sn 1987a also for the second maximum .",
    "but the formula also assumes that the temperature is governed by the presence of hydrogen .",
    "this is not a unique statement , as the complicated thermal balance may settle around this temperature also without the presence of hydrogen .",
    "even if hydrogen is mixed far into the core , the end of the second maximum is likely to give only limited information about the minimum velocity of hydrogen .",
    "ideally , both spectra and @xmath15 colors should be obtained by full nlte modeling ( see arguments put forward by eastman 1997 ) . for sn 1987a",
    "spectral nlte modeling has been made by several groups ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , while nlte modeling of colors are given in the literature only for the first days after the explosion ( @xcite ) .",
    "our approach can not add to this nlte modeling , but as discussed by , e.g. , hflich ( 1995 , see also references therein ) , lte modeling is useful even for such rapidly expanding objects as type ia sne , and should therefore also give some insight to the physical conditions of sn 1987a .",
    "inspired by this , we compare our lte results with observations in figure  [ 14e1ubv ] .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 light curves are in surprisingly good agreement with observations .",
    "likewise , for the @xmath6 band the agreement is satisfactory for the first days , though at later epochs the modeled flux is too high .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of the light curve qualitatively reproduces the observations .",
    "there is also a qualitative agreement between our calculated fluxes and the observed fluxes in _ iue _ bands ( @xcite ) ( see figs .",
    "[ iue10 ] ,  [ iue100 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the agreement is good for the first 10 days for the swp and the two lwp bands , while the modeled flux overshoots early for the lwp 3000  3300   band , like it does for the modeled @xmath6 flux .",
    "later , the modeled flux in the bands with the shortest wavelengths undershoots , while for the range 2500  3000  , the agreement is still fairly good .",
    "the modeled flux in the band with the longest wavelengths continues to be high for the first 100 days ( fig .",
    "[ iue100 ] ) .",
    "the disagreement between modeled and observed uv fluxes after @xmath101  days is not surprising , because the lte modeling at that epoch becomes quite unrealistic when there is no longer a true photosphere . for earlier epochs",
    ", there can be several causes for deviations .",
    "the early drop of the modeled fluxes in the shortest iue bands could signal that the photosphere is somewhat hotter than in the 14e1 model ; the flux here falls into the wien part of the spectrum and it is exponentially sensitive to the temperature .",
    "it is harder to explain why the observed uv flux for @xmath102    and the flux in the @xmath6 band fall below what we predict . within the lte approach this could mean that the expansion opacity is not complete in the eastman - pinto ( 1993 ) approximation .",
    "the line list of eastman & pinto includes @xmath103 lines , but they and baron et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have pointed out that it is also necessary to include millions of weaker lines ( see also hflich 1995 ) , mostly of iron .",
    "should the eastman - pinto list be sufficient , then one might think of enhancing the abundance of iron group elements in the outer layers of the supernova to increase the opacity .",
    "our experiments with such an enhancement show that we can bring the @xmath6 flux in much better agreement with observations",
    ". there could also be other causes for our too strong uv flux , but it seems reasonable to assume that line opacities are somehow involved .",
    "this is highlighted by the good agreement between modeled and _ iue _ fluxes in the 2500  3000   range where there are relatively few spectral lines .",
    "this could perhaps indicate that the envelope is contaminated with heavy elements which could give a higher opacity in the uv .",
    "in this context we note that pun et al .",
    "( 1995 ) do not cite wagoner , perez , & vasu ( 1991 ) correctly when they state that `` the expansion opacities in the wavelength region 10004000   increase by a factor of more than 100 as the temperature of the atmosphere drops from 12,000 to 5000 k '' .",
    "we point out that it is not the expansion opacity in wagoner et al .",
    "( 1991 ; see also @xcite ) which increases by this number .",
    "the correct statement is that the ratio of expansion opacity to electron scattering increases by a factor of @xmath104 .",
    "it does so because the electron scattering opacity drops drastically due to recombination as the temperature is lowered .",
    "we have not tried to include millions of weak lines in our models to check whether this can bring the uv observations and our lte models in better agreement . if such an experiment would fail , and the metal content of the envelope is not unusually high ( cf . above ) , then one has to consider nlte effects already for a few days after the explosion",
    ". the main nlte effect here could be the excitation of hydrogen from its second principal level , @xmath105 , perhaps creating an optically thick balmer continuum . from nlte atmospheric calculations",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite ) we know that early overpopulation of @xmath106 is present in sn 1987a , though it is not sufficient to explain the observed absorption in the balmer range , unless there is a direct excitation due to radioactivity .",
    "while it is certainly important to include nonthermal excitation in late spectra hydrogen ( e.g. , @xcite ; kozma & fransson 1998b ) , the same effect operating at early times could be one more hint of extremely efficient outward mixing of radioactive material into the hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "the possibility that hydrogen could be excited as a result of circumstellar interaction seems much more unlikely because of the very low density inferred for the circumstellar gas (  4 ; chevalier 1999 ; lundqvist 1999 ) .",
    "we present in figures  [ tpfit ]  [ vphot ] the comparison of our numerical results with the `` photospheric '' parameters found by observers .",
    "we put this in quotes since what is given by observers are not really the parameters of the photosphere , but the best blackbody fit temperature @xmath107 ( which is higher than @xmath63 ) , and the radius , @xmath108 , found from @xmath109 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath108 is substantially smaller than the radius of the true photosphere , @xmath110 , especially at the earliest stages .",
    "in the above discussion , the light curve has mainly been used to probe the internal abundance distribution .",
    "figure  [ bol3en ] shows how the bolometric light curve depends on @xmath14 . for a given ejecta mass and using the standard mixing , we can find constraints on @xmath14 from the light curve ( shigeyama 1987 , 1988 ; nomoto 1987 , 1994 ; woosley 1988 ; woosley 1988 ; arnett & fu 1989 ; @xcite ) .",
    "first , the luminosity near the minimum around day 10 ( which corresponds to the early short plateau in the @xmath5 curve ) is almost proportional to @xmath14 ( litvinova & nadezhin 1990 , popov 1993 ) , thus providing an important constraint on @xmath14 .",
    "second , the time of the peak , @xmath111 months , depends on @xmath14 . for larger @xmath14 , i.e. , faster expansion ,",
    "the rise starts earlier because of earlier appearance of heating due to radioactivity ; the decline after the peak is earlier because of a larger velocity of the ejecta which causes the diffusion time - scale to be shorter .",
    "the analytical treatment of this epoch is given in detail by imshennik & popov ( 1992 ) .",
    "we caution that it is not just @xmath14 that determines @xmath112 ( for a given hydrogen distribution ) , but the combination @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath112 is therefore mainly determined by @xmath70 and the hydrogen distribution .",
    "figure  [ bol3en ] shows that both the first and the second parts of the light curve are reproduced well by 14e1 ( see also fig .",
    "[ 14elum3 ] ) .",
    "14e1.3 is too bright near the minimum , while 14e0.7 is too dim near the minimum and evolves too slowly .",
    "compared with the flux - limited diffusion model ( shigeyama & nomoto 1990 ) 14e1 evolves similarly , but in much better agreement with observations both near the minimum and near the peak when a more accurate radiative transfer scheme is used .    for the progenitor we have used in figure",
    "[ bol3en ] ( i.e. , the model with mixing and @xmath113  ) , the best explosion energy in order to fit the observations is close to @xmath114  ergs .",
    "considering the uncertainties of the progenitor model in terms of mixing and envelope mass , we obtain best fits to the bolometric light curve for the explosion energies in the range @xmath115  ergs . as noted in figure 9 , the `` true '' bolometric is likely to be intermediate to the saao and ctio / eso results used in our fits ( see suntzeff & bouchet 1990 ) .",
    "this allows for a @xmath116 span in luminosity . however , a larger error in luminosity ( @xmath117 , lundqvist et al .",
    "1999b ) is due to the still prevailing uncertainty in distance modulus to the supernova ( e.g. , walker 1999 ) , which gives a combined error of approximately @xmath118 in absolute luminosity .",
    "the explosion energy should therefore be within the range @xmath119  ergs .",
    "we note that @xmath14 is very similar to in the analytical diffusion models of arnett & fu ( 1989 ) and imshennik & popov ( 1992 ) .",
    "( the initial theory of diffusion was developed by arnett [ 1980 , 1982 ] for type ia supernovae . )",
    "all these models use an eigenvalue formulation of the problem , which is not strictly correct ( blinnikov & popov 1993 ) . however , the more correct , though more complicated , moving - boundary formulation produces results which agree rather well with the results of imshennik & popov ( 1992 ; see popov 1995 ) .",
    "we therefore support the use of the results of imshennik & popov ( 1992 ) to make reliable estimates of the supernova parameters from the near maximum light .",
    "this rather limited range of energies we find is important for calculations of the ionization of the circumstellar gas ( e.g. , lundqvist & fransson 1996 ; lundqvist 1999 ) . until now these calculations have been based on the models 500full1 and 500full2 of ensman & burrows ( 1992 ) .",
    "qualitatively , the 500full1 model is rather similar to the models in our preferred energy range",
    ". we will discuss this in detail in lundqvist et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , but from the analysis in lundqvist & fransson ( 1996 ) we note immediately that the ionization of the outer rings is particularly sensitive to the spectrum of the burst .",
    "the above analysis has been based on a progenitor model with @xmath120 48.5 .",
    "the uncertainty in the luminosity of the progenitor may imply that @xmath2 could be uncertain by @xmath58 20 % ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have calculated the light curve models 14e1.26r , 14e1.34r , and 14e1.45r for @xmath120 40 , and one model , 14e1.4r6 , for @xmath120 58(table [ runs ] and figs .",
    "[ bol2r40 ] , [ bol2r4r6 ] ) .",
    "the early light curve for the first 2 days is not so different from the case of the standard @xmath121 48.5 , but @xmath47 scales as @xmath122 .",
    "however , the light curve near the minimum ( plateau in @xmath5 ) is dimmer for @xmath120 40  because the luminosity at that epoch is approximately proportional to @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "for @xmath120 40 , we need an explosion energy larger than @xmath123 ergs to put the light curve in agreement with the observations near the minimum ( fig .",
    "[ bol2r40 ] ) .",
    "but then the peak is too early .",
    "a larger radius , @xmath120 58 , shows an opposite trend . in this case",
    ", one needs a lower energy for the brightness at the minimum , but then the peak is too late .",
    "we have also made some runs for models where the hydrogen abundance in the outer layers was artificially raised to 0.7 ( as is also assumed in , e.g. , the non - evolutionary models by @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the model 14e1.25h ( table [ runs ] ) has the same composition of metals as 14e1 , but h is enhanced at the expense of he .",
    "so , the total mass of h is here @xmath124 , while it was @xmath125 in the standard runs ( 14e1 , 14e1.3 etc . ) .",
    "the hydrogen rich model 14e1.25h evolves similarly to the standard runs 14e1.3 and 14e1.21 ( fig .",
    "[ lb3heh ] ) .",
    "this explains the success of such models , as demonstrated by utrobin ( 1993 ) , but it is hard to justify a solar h abundance for sn 1987a from the evolutionary point of view , as well as in context of the abundances in the inner circumstellar ring ( e.g. , lundqvist & fransson 1996 ) .",
    "in this paper we have described an extensive set of full radiation hydrodynamics calculations aimed to improving the modeling of the first few months of the light curve of sn 1987a .",
    "we have shown that the improved models can reproduce the light curve and suggest that proper handling of the radiation transfer is indeed decisive for the success of model fits .",
    "the full multi - group radiation hydrodynamic modeling is more reliable mainly because the effects of scattering are treated self - consistently .",
    "our findings are that :    1 .",
    "the color temperatures and broad band photometry ( and full continuum spectra ) are predicted correctly for the first days of the supernova .",
    "the shape of the modeled light curve , especially near the bolometric minimum at @xmath126 days , and during the broad peak at @xmath101 days is much better in the multi - group approach than in the equilibrium diffusion one .",
    "the density profiles of the supernova at various epochs are smoother .",
    "our code assumes lte , but we have bracketed nlte effects by extreme assumptions of the treatment of spectral lines ( as either being scattering dominated , or fully absorptive ) .",
    "we find that the emission at shock break - out is not sensitive to those assumptions , which gives us confidence in our results .",
    "this is supported by a very good agreement with _",
    "observations for the first days . for the first 100 days , best agreement is obtained when nlte effects are mimicked by treating the line opacity as absorptive , following the prescription of baron et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "looking at our results in greater detail , we find that the color temperature around shock breakout exceeds @xmath127 k , which is higher than those obtained using a more approximate approach ( e.g. , shigeyama & nomoto 1990 ) , but not so different from the model 500full1 of ensman & burrows ( 1992 ) .",
    "the large difference between color and effective temperatures persists for the first hours .",
    "this implies that the rise in the @xmath5 luminosity is slower than in equilibrium diffusion models ( which was first noticed by hflich 1991 ) . because of the overwhelming dominance of electron scattering during the first hours , the rise in the @xmath5 band is too slow in all of our models",
    "this raises the question on the calibration of the first photometry data of sn 1987a ( mcnaught & zoltowski 1987 ; west & mcnaught 1992 ) .",
    "it is indicated by our light curve modeling that mixing of  up to @xmath128   could be needed , but our analysis is unlikely to supersede those of spectral analysis ( e.g. , @xcite , kozma & fransson 1998a , b ) , modeling of early x - ray emission ( e.g. , kumagai et al .",

    "to arrive at this result we have assumed that the most likely range of @xmath13 is @xmath13 = 7 - 10 @xmath23 ( saio 1988b ) , in order for models of the presupernova evolution to be consistent with the enhancement of n / c and n / o in the circumstellar matter ( lundqvist & fransson 1996 ) . knowing the energy with this accuracy , as well as having a detailed spectroscopic evolution from our models , we can constrain the ionization of the circumstellar gas much better than before .",
