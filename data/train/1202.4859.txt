    "the possibility that black holes can act as particle accelerators has been intensively studied since baados , silk and west  @xcite discovered that the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of two colliding particles can be arbitrarily high if the collision occurs in the vicinity of the horizon of a nearly maximally rotating black hole and if the angular momentum of either of the particles is fine - tuned .",
    "although the effects of self - force might prevent the cm energy from being arbitrarily high  @xcite , it would also be reasonable to assume that the cm energy is still high enough to be of physical interest if the mass - ratio of the particle to the black hole is very small  @xcite .",
    "this process was generalized to most general geodesic particles  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was revealed  @xcite that the fine - tuning of the angular momentum is naturally realized for the particle orbiting an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , which is important in astrophysical contexts .",
    "in fact , to obtain an arbitrarily high cm energy , the particle motion does not need to be geodesic .",
    "it was found  @xcite that the cm energy can be arbitrarily high for the collision of charged particles near the horizon of charged black holes and charged rotating black holes , where the fine - tuning of the angular momentum is naturally realized for the particle orbiting the isco if it exists .",
    "magnetic fields prevail in astrophysical compact objects .",
    "although the strength of magnetic fields at the horizon radius of the black hole has never been directly observed , it is estimated to be @xmath0 gauss for stellar mass black holes and @xmath1 gauss for supermassive black holes using the relation based on the energy equipartition in accretion flows , the variability plane and the observed characteristic frequency of the x - ray variability  @xcite .",
    "these values are fairly strong but still much weaker than the critical one @xmath2 above which the self - gravity of magnetic fields directly affects the spacetime geometry around the horizon of the black hole of mass @xmath3 . on the other hand , as we will see later , the effects of the magnetic fields to the particle motion appear with the nondimensional parameter @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the charge and the rest mass of the particle , respectively . since @xmath8 is very large for",
    "elementary charged particles , the value of @xmath9 is extremely large .",
    "in fact , the effects of magnetic fields to the motion of elementary charged particles can never be neglected and the limit @xmath10 is expected to give an excellent approximation .",
    "the isco of charged particles around a weakly magnetized rotating black hole was analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite and more general motion of charged particles around a weakly magnetized schwarzschild black hole was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , frolov  @xcite found that when two particles collide near the horizon of a weakly magnetized schwarzschild black hole , one of which is charged and orbiting the isco with a finite killing energy , the cm energy can be arbitrarily high if the magnetic field is _",
    "arbitrarily strong_. this phenomenon might be connected to the fact that the radius of the isco approaches that of the event horizon in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "this phenomenon should be distinguished from the baados - silk - west ( bsw ) process in the respect that to obtain an arbitrarily high cm energy frolov s process needs to presuppose an arbitrarily strong physical field at the beginning . on the other hand , frolov s process might be relevant to astrophysics because @xmath9 estimated in astrophysical black holes is extremely large .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold : to develop the general mathematical framework to obtain the cm energy of non - geodesic particles and , in particular , charged particles in a test electromagnetic field around a kerr black hole and to identify the effects of test magnetic fields for the charged particles around schwarzschild and kerr black holes with a special focus on the cm energy for the collision of a charged particle orbiting the isco with a generic neutral counterpart .",
    "we then naturally embed frolov s scenario and baados , silk and west s scenario into the particle acceleration by a weakly magnetized kerr black hole .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we develop the mathematical framework to obtain the cm energy of non - geodesic particle collisions . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we consider charged particle motion in a uniform magnetic field around a kerr black hole .",
    "in particular , we focus on the isco of a charged particle and demonstrate that the radius of the isco approaches the horizon radius as the uniform magnetic field is strengthened . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , to discuss the effects of a uniform magnetic field on the bsw process and of rotation of the black hole on frolov s process , we evaluate the cm energy of charged particle collisions around a magnetized kerr black hole .",
