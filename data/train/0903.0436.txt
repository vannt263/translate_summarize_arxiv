    "the separatrices ( the level sets of @xmath7 containing saddle points ) form a rectangular lattice .    in the second case",
    ", there is more than one unbounded level set of @xmath7 containing critical points , and thus there are ` open channels ' in the flow , and some of the solutions of the equation @xmath21 go off to infinity .",
