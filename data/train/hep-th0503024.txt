    "recent discoveries in cosmology have shown that general relativity is most likely incomplete .",
    "in particular the high degree of homogeneity and isotropy of the universe can only be understood by einstein s theory with an inflationary scenario .",
    "also the accelerating expansion of the universe by dark energy might hint to a further modification of general relativity .",
    "most of these additions to general relativity introduce new fields in a quite _ ad hoc _ way .",
    "for instance , inflationary models typically postulate one or two scalar fields which drive a rapid expansion of the early universe . even in general relativity",
    "the metric is not derived from any underlying symmetry principle .",
    "an exception are gauge theories of gravity in which the existence of a connection is justified by the gauging .",
    "also in ghost condensation  @xcite the dynamical field appears as the goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken time diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "however , in many other cases the group theoretical origin of the gravitational fields remains unclear .    in this paper",
    "we show that the existence of most of these fields can be understood in terms of goldstone bosons which arise in a rapid symmetry breaking phase shortly after the big bang .",
    "we assume that at the beginning of the universe all spacetime structures were absent and consider the universe as a hilbert space @xmath0 accommodating spinor and tensor representations of the analytic diffeomorphism group @xmath1 .",
    "unlike in general relativity spinors and tensors are representations of the same covering group @xmath1 whose existence has been shown in @xcite .",
    "since spinor representations of @xmath1 are necessarily infinite - dimensional @xcite , matter would look quite exotic at this stage .",
    "here we are however not so much interested in the structure of these representations . for our purposes , it is enough to suppose that they do exist .",
    "we further assume that in a series of spontaneous symmetry breakings , the transformation group @xmath2 of states in the hilbert space collapsed down to the lorentz group .",
    "we suggest that the symmetry breaking sequence is given by the group inclusion @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the homogeneous part of the diffeomorphism group , @xmath5 the general linear group and @xmath6 the lorentz group .",
    "this corresponds to the breaking of translations ( tr ) , nonlinear transformations ( nl ) , dilations and shear transformations ( sd ) , respectively .",
    "the existence of such a symmetry breaking scenario appears more convincing if it is considered from bottom up . at low temperatures the vacuum is invariant under local lorentz transformations and matter",
    "is represented by lorentz spinors .",
    "it is conceivable that at higher temperatures matter transforms under a larger spacetime group .",
    "the most prominent example is scale invariance which is believed to be restored at high energies . here",
    "matter is described by spinors of the conformal group which contains the lorentz group as a subgroup .",
    "it is not implausible that further symmetries of the diffeomorphism group and in the end all of them are restored at very high temperatures .",
    "so far we focused exclusively on the breaking of the transformation group @xmath2 of states in the hilbert space .",
    "a series of phase transitions , matter is again represented by spinors of the lorentz group rather than the diffeomorphism group .",
    "the appealing aspect of this view of matter is that gravitational fields emerge naturally as goldstone bosons of the symmetry breaking ( quasi as a by - product ) . in each phase of the breaking",
    "we loose degrees of freedom in the matter sector , i.e.  states in the hilbert space , but gain new geometrical objects in terms of goldstone fields .",
    "spacetime appears as an emergent product of this process .    a convenient concept to determine these bosons is given by the nonlinear realization approach .",
    "this technique provides the transformation behavior of fields  @xmath7 of a coset space @xmath8 which is associated with the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry group @xmath9 down to a stabilizing subgroup @xmath2 .",
    "nonlinear realizations of spacetime groups have been studied in a number of papers @xcite . as in @xcite",
    "we consider nonlinear realizations of the diffeomorphism group , i.e.we choose @xmath10 and @xmath2 to be one of the groups in the above sequence .",
    "it turns out that in this way the relevant gravitational fields , such as coordinates , affine connection and metric , are all of the same nature : they can be identified with goldstone bosons or coset fields of the diffeomorphism group .",
    "let us have a brief look at the nonlinear realizations in detail .",
    "the first nonlinear realization with @xmath11 corresponds to the breaking of translational invariance and shows the existence of dynamical coordinates in terms of goldstone fields .",
    "subsequently , we realize @xmath12 with @xmath13 as stability group .",
    "the corresponding coset fields transform as a holonomic affine connection and can be used for an affine theory of gravity .",
    "finally , we realize @xmath14 with the lorentz group @xmath15 as stability group corresponding to the additional breaking of dilations and shear transformations .",
    "the corresponding coset parameters can be interpreted as tetrads which lead to the definition of a metric .",
    "this has already been found by borisov and ogievetsky @xcite who studied a simultaneous realization of the affine and the conformal group with the lorentz group as stability group .    .",
    "the metric is conformally flat for @xmath16 , tachyonic for @xmath17 and becomes massless at the minimum of the potential at @xmath18 , @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    though nonlinear realizations of spacetime groups have been studied for quite some time , with a few exceptions @xcite , there have not as yet been developed any higgs models for the dynamical breaking of these groups . in this paper",
    "we construct such a gravitational higgs mechanism by introducing the metric as a higgs field into an affine spacetime .",
    "this effectively corresponds to a metric - affine theory of gravity @xcite in which @xmath25 breaks down to @xmath26 in the tangent space of the spacetime manifold .",
    "the higgs sector is constructed as follows . in analogy to the isospinor scalar @xmath27 of electroweak symmetry breaking , the breaking is induced by a ( real ) scalar field @xmath21 and a symmetric tensor  @xmath28 which has ten independent components . under the lorentz group",
    "the tensor @xmath28 decomposes into its trace @xmath29 and a traceless tensor @xmath30 according to @xmath31 .",
    "the singlet @xmath29 turns out to be a massive gravitational higgs field , whereas the fields @xmath32 and @xmath21 are the ten goldstone fields associated with the coset @xmath33 .",
    "as shown by the nonlinear realization approach , these fields define the metric @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the shear generators and @xmath21 parameterizes dilations . in tab .",

    "the symmetry breaking potential was very similar to the potential of hybrid inflation .",
    "however , ordinary inflation scenarios assume the validness of general relativity during inflation",
    ". in our model einstein s theory is a good description of gravity only at the very end of the condensation .",
    "nevertheless , it is very suggestive to consider hybrid inflation as a consequence of the symmetry breaking . in order to show this",
    ", one would have to derive a friedmann equation for a ( metric-)affine spacetime .",
    "the existence of such an equation has already been shown for a cartan - weyl spacetime @xcite .",
    "this gives some confidence that hybrid inflation could indeed be an artifact of the condensation of the metric .",
    "we believe that the story of an emergent spacetime has just begun . in this paper",
    "we focused mainly on the breaking of shears and dilations and only briefly sketched other parts of the full gravitational symmetry breaking scenario .",
    "in particular , there is the condensation of the coordinates corresponding to the breaking of translational invariance as described in ghost models",
    ". it would be interesting to combine such models with the condensation of the metric .",
    "it is also conceivable that the affine spacetime itself arose out of a spacetime with even less structure by the condensation of an affine connection .",

    "<S> in this paper we elaborate on the idea of an emergent spacetime which arises due to the dynamical breaking of diffeomorphism invariance in the early universe . in preparation for an explicit symmetry breaking scenario , we consider nonlinear realizations of the group of analytical diffeomorphisms which provide a unified description of spacetime structures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that gravitational fields , such as the affine connection , metric and coordinates , can all be interpreted as goldstone fields of the diffeomorphism group . </S>",
    "<S> we then construct a higgs mechanism for gravity in which an affine spacetime evolves into a riemannian one by the condensation of a metric . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking potential is identical to that of hybrid inflation but with the non - inflaton scalar extended to a symmetric second rank tensor . </S>",
    "<S> this tensor is required for the realization of the metric as a higgs field . </S>",
    "<S> we finally comment on the role of goldstone coordinates as a dynamical fluid of reference . </S>"
