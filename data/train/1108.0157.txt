    "one of the main goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is the detection of the higgs boson , or of at least one of several higgs bosons if corresponding extensions of the standard model ( sm ) are realized in nature .",
    "these searches depend crucially on the higgs masses , production cross sections and the higgs decays .    in the case of the sm ,",
    "the production cross sections and decay branching ratios are quite well known as functions of the unknown higgs mass @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with its extended higgs sector and parameter space , these quantities have been studied as well and it seems that at least one of the higgs bosons can not be missed at the lhc @xcite ( we speak of a so - called no - lose theorem ) .",
    "there exist , however , well motivated scenarios with somewhat more extended higgs sectors , as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm , see @xcite for recent reviews ) , where the higgs production rates and decays can differ strongly from both the sm and the mssm .",
    "it is very important to be aware of the possibility of such unconventional properties of higgs bosons ; otherwise the absence of a signal in standard higgs search channels , or unusual signals , may be completely misinterpreted .",
    "typical such unconventional properties of higgs bosons in the nmssm are higgs - to - higgs decays , higgs boson with reduced couplings to gauge bosons , and/or higgs masses incompatible with the mssm . in the last years , many studies have been performed in order to investigate which scenarios are possible in the nmssm , and by means of which signals they could be detected .",
    "note that the interest in such studies is twofold : in some cases , it can be very challenging to detect a signal of any of the higgs bosons of the nmssm .",
    "in other cases a single signal is nearly as easy to see as in the mssm , but only a detailed study of the complete visible higgs spectrum can possibly allow to distinguish the nmssm from the mssm : for instance , the mass of the dominantly sm - like higgs boson ( with the largest couplings to electroweak gauge bosons ) can be larger than 140  gev in the nmssm , with slightly reduced couplings to electroweak gauge bosons .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the status of such nmssm - specific higgs properties and searches .",
    "we review the various possible scenarios , and the available studies on corresponding search strategies for higgs bosons .",
    "the higgs sector of the nmssm consists of two su(2 ) doublets @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( where , as in the mssm , @xmath1 couples to up - type quarks and @xmath2 to down - type quarks and leptons ) , and one additional gauge singlet @xmath3 . due to its coupling @xmath4 in the superpotential , a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath5 of @xmath3 generates a supersymmetric mass term @xmath6 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 . since @xmath5 and hence @xmath7 are naturally of the order of the soft susy breaking terms @xmath8 , this solves the so - called @xmath9-problem of the mssm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in its simplest @xmath10 invariant version , the superpotential of the nmssm is scale invariant ; it is in fact the simplest phenomenologically acceptable supersymmetric extension of the sm with this property .",
    "the nmssm shares with the mssm the unification of the running gauge coupling constants at a grand unification ( gut ) scale , and the natural presence of a dark matter candidate in the form of a stable lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "the physical neutral higgs sector in the nmssm consists of 3 cp - even and 2 cp - odd states .",
    "( here we do not consider the possibility of cp violation in the higgs sector . ) in general , these states are mixtures of the corresponding cp - even or cp - odd components of the weak eigenstates @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , without the cp - odd goldstone boson swallowed by the massive @xmath11 boson",
    ".    many analyses of the higgs sector of the nmssm @xcite pointed out that the physical eigenstates in the cp - even sector can well be strong mixtures of su(2 ) doublet and singlet states with reduced couplings to gauge bosons . this motivated studies on the detectability of one or many higgs states at lep @xcite , the lhc @xcite and a more energetic linear collider @xcite ( see also @xcite for searches for higgs bosons beyond the sm at linear colliders ) .",
    "as mentioned first in @xcite , higgs - to - higgs decays can be important for higgs detection in certain regions of the parameter space of the nmssm .",
    "notably the lightest cp - odd state @xmath12 can play the role of a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite whose small mass can lead to dominant @xmath13 decays of cp - even states @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the possibility of higgs - to - higgs decays inhibited to establish an all - embracing no - lose theorem for the nmssm @xcite , and triggered numerous studies on higgs detection in such circumstances .",
    "the proposed strategies depend on the masses and branching ratios of the involved higgs bosons , and will be reviewed in chapter  4 .",
    "a list of benchmark points corresponding to unconventional scenarios in the higgs sector of the nmssm was proposed in @xcite , where the then available search strategies have been summarized .",
    "non - standard higgs boson decays were also reviewed in @xcite and , in the light of the fine - tuning problem , in @xcite .",
    "both singlet - doublet mixings and higgs - to - higgs decays allow for sm - like cp - even higgs bosons with masses well below 114  gev , compatible with lep constraints @xcite alleviating the `` little fine - tuning problem '' of the mssm @xcite .",
    "the reduced higgs couplings , higgs production rates at the lhc and higgs branching ratios in the nmssm have recently been studied in @xcite .    in the next chapter",
    "we briefly review the higgs sector of the nmssm , and present constraints .",
    "chapter  3 is dedicated to nmssm scenarios which allow to detect a higgs boson in `` standard '' higgs search channels .",
    "we focus on scenarios where signals can be visible , but where the properties of the higgs states ( masses above @xmath15  gev , branching ratios or the number of distinct states ) allow potentially to distinguish the nmssm from the mssm .",
    "these scenarios occur typically in the case of singlet / doublet mixings in the higgs sector of the nmssm . in chapter  4",
    "we consider scenarios which require dedicated search strategies , notably in the cases of dominant higgs - to - higgs decays .",
    "conclusions are given in chapter  5 .",
    "the nmssm differs from the mssm due to the presence of the gauge singlet superfield @xmath3 . in the simplest @xmath10 invariant realisation of the nmssm , the higgs mass term @xmath16 in the superpotential @xmath17 of the mssm",
    "is replaced by the coupling @xmath18 of @xmath3 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 and a self - coupling @xmath19 .",
    "hence , in this simplest version the superpotential @xmath20 is scale invariant , and given by : [ eq:1 ] w_nmssm = s h_uh_d + s^3 +  , where hatted letters denote superfields , and the dots denote the mssm - like yukawa couplings of @xmath21 and @xmath22 to the quark and lepton superfields .",
    "once the real scalar component of @xmath23 develops a vev @xmath5 , the first term in @xmath20 generates an effective @xmath9-term [ eq:2 ] _",
    "the phenomenological constraint @xmath24  gev from the non - observation of charginos implies @xmath25 .    the soft susy breaking terms consist of mass terms for the higgs bosons @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and trilinear interactions ( omitting squarks and sleptons ) [ eq:3 ] -l _ = m_h_u^2 | h_u    expressions for the mass matrices of the physical cp - even and cp - odd higgs states ",
    "after @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 have assumed vevs @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath5 and including the dominant radiative corrections  can be found in @xcite in will not be repeated here ; below we just recall some relevant properties of the physical states .",
    "( we will use @xmath28 and @xmath29 . )    in the cp - even sector we find three states which are mixtures of the real components of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the state @xmath30 with the largest ( often nearly sm - like ) coupling to the electroweak gauge bosons has a mass squared @xmath31 given by for the mostly sm - like cp - even higgs boson , but @xmath14 or @xmath32 for general cp - even higgs bosons . ]",

    "the term @xmath34 in ( [ eq:4 ] ) originates from singlet - doublet mixing and becomes for weak mixing [ eq:6 ] _ where @xmath35 is given by @xmath31 without the mixing term .",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first , neglecting singlet - doublet mixing , @xmath36 can be larger than in the mssm due to the second term in ( [ eq:4 ] ) : up to @xmath15  gev @xcite if the running coupling @xmath37 is assumed to remain perturbative below the gut scale , but up to @xmath38  gev @xcite if this assumption is given up .",
    "second , depending on the unknown parameters as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41  and hence the mass of the singlet - like cp - even state  can be larger or smaller than @xmath35 . for @xmath42",
    "we have @xmath43 in ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "hence it is not guaranteed that the contribution to @xmath31 from the nmssm specific terms in ( [ eq:4 ] )  the sum of the second and forth terms on the right hand side  is positive .",
    "( of course , the negative contribution from @xmath34 vanishes if , accidentially , @xmath44 . )    for @xmath45 , @xmath30 is actually the second lightest higgs state , and the mass of the singlet - like cp - even state is typically below 114  gev .",
    "now we have @xmath46 in ( [ eq:4 ] ) , which can augment the mass @xmath36 well above 140  gev even for larger @xmath47 , where the second nmssm specific term in ( [ eq:4 ] ) becomes small .    now the mixing angle",
    "( i.e. the coupling to the @xmath11 boson ) of the singlet - like cp - even higgs state is constrained by lep @xcite : the non - observation of a signal at lep leads to upper bounds on @xmath48 as function of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the reduced coupling of @xmath14 to @xmath11 ( normalized with respect to the sm ) , and @xmath51 the branching ratio into @xmath52 normalized with respect to the sm .",
    "( the singlet - like cp - even state will still have @xmath53 . ) for convenience we have reproduced the corresponding figure from @xcite as fig .  [ fig:1 ] below .     from lep @xcite .",
    "full line : observed limit ; dashed line : expected limit ; dark ( green ) shaded band : within 68% probability ; light ( yellow ) band : within 95% probability . ]",
    "one can note that , due to a slight excess of events , the upper bound on @xmath54 is particularly weak for @xmath49 around @xmath55  gev .",
    "this behaviour does certainly not require the presence of a higgs state with a corresponding mass and @xmath56 , but it could be explained by a such a dominantly singlet - like cp - even higgs state ( not within the sm ! ) .",
    "finally the singlet - like cp - even higgs state can be lighter than @xmath57 such that the nearly sm - like higgs @xmath30 could decay dominantly into a pair of singlet - like cp - even higgs states .",

    ", the cp - odd mass squared matrix has a diagonal element [ eq:7 ] m_p , aa^2 = .",
    "the diagonal element of the cp - odd mass squared matrix in the singlet sector is given by ( assuming again @xmath33 ) [ eq:8 ] m_p , ss^2 -3a_s .",
    "hence , depending on the unknown parameters , one can find a light cp - odd dominantly singlet - like state in the nmssm . considering the full cp - odd mass matrix ,",
    "one obtains a massless physical goldstone boson either in the peccei - quinn symmetry limit @xmath59 , or in the @xmath60-symmetry limit @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "hence a light cp - odd higgs state @xmath12 playing the role of a pseudo - goldstone boson is natural in the nmssm , if any of these symmetries is approximately realized .",
    "phenomenological constraints on the mass @xmath62 depend heavily on the coupling of @xmath12 to @xmath63-quarks .",

    "@xmath78 mixings become relevant @xcite with potentially desirable implications on @xmath79 spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "finally the charged higgs boson mass is given by [ eq:10 ] m_^2 = m_p , aa^2 + v^2(-^2 ) with @xmath96 as in ( [ eq:7 ] ) . due to the last term @xmath97",
    ", the charged higgs boson , compared to the corresponding cp - even and cp - odd higgs bosons , can be somewhat lighter as in the mssm .",
    "lower bounds on @xmath98 result from the non - observation of charged higgs bosons in top quark decays at the tevatron @xcite and depend on @xmath47 .",
    "stronger lower bounds on @xmath98 result from @xmath75-physics like @xmath99 , unless cancellations with sparticle - induced loop diagrams occur @xcite .",

    "hence we find @xmath103 , and the @xmath9-problem is still solved for @xmath104 . in this limit",
    "the singlet - like cp - even and cp - odd higgs states decouple and become unobservable , independent from their masses ( which remain of @xmath105 )",
    ". then the nmssm could be distinguished from the mssm only if the singlino - like neutralino is the lsp , appearing as final state in all sparticle decay cascades @xcite .    to summarize this chapter ,",
    "the following nmssm specific scenarios are possible in the higgs sector :    * cp - even higgs bosons : due to possibly large singlet - doublet mixing angles , more  potentially three !  cp - even states than in the mssm could be observable , but with reduced signal rates for any of them .",
    "the dominantly sm - like state @xmath30 can be heavier than in the mssm .",
    "a dominantly singlet - like state with a mass below 110  gev is compatible with lep constraints , and can shift upwards ( due to mixing ) the mass of @xmath30 beyond 140  gev ( see the next chapter ) .",

    "depending on @xmath36 and notably on @xmath62 , many different cascade decays of @xmath30 are possible , all of which require dedicated studies .",
    "before we review such studies in chapter  4 , we consider nmssm specific phenomena in standard higgs search channels in the next chapter .",
    "the establishment of a no - lose theorem in the absence of ( dominant ) higgs - to - higgs decays in the nmssm @xcite relied essentially on the following higgs production and decay channels at the lhc ( where @xmath14 denotes any of the three cp - even higgs states ; see also @xcite ) :     vector boson fusion ( vbf ) with @xmath107 ;  associate production of @xmath14 with @xmath108 or @xmath109 , with @xmath110 and a charged lepton from @xmath108 or @xmath109 in the final state; associate production of @xmath14 with @xmath109 , and @xmath111 .    of course",
    ", many more channels contribute to sm - like higgs searches , as gluon - gluon ( @xmath112 ) fusion and vbf with @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and various final states from @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "the most difficult scenarios in the nmssm require up to 300 fb@xmath118 integrated luminosity at the lhc for a clean signal .",
    "these correspond to cases where the mixing angles in the cp - even higgs sector are large : the three physical higgs states share their couplings to electroweak gauge bosons according to the sum rule [ eq:11 ] _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 |g_i^2 = 1 , where @xmath119 is the reduced coupling of @xmath32 to @xmath120 or @xmath11 normalized with respect to the sm . in difficult scenarios ,",
    "all @xmath119 satisfy @xmath121 .",
    "note that large mixing angles imply that the mass differences between the cp - even higgs states are not large , hence one finds typically @xmath122  gev , @xmath123 , in such scenarios .",
    "( similar observations have been made in case studies in @xcite . )    on the other hand , precisely such scenarios allow potentially for the simultaneous observation of several higgs states in the nmssm , with masses and couplings incompatible with the mssm .",
    "corresponding studies of signal rates for @xmath124 ( production cross sections times branching ratios ) have been performed in @xcite .",
    "more complete studies ( including more relevant higgs production and decay channels ) concerning the question under which circumstances the simultaneous observation of several higgs states would allow to distinguish the nmssm from the mssm would certainly be challenging , but highly welcome",
    ".    in the case of higgs decays into two photons , already the observation of a single state can give us possibly a hint in this direction : if the sm - like and singlet - like states are strongly mixed , the coupling of the lighter eigenstate to @xmath63-quarks can be strongly suppressed , implying a strong reduction of the corresponding partial width into @xmath52 and a corresponding enhanced branching ratio into @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "inspite the somewhat reduced higgs production rate , the signal rate for this process can be six times larger than in the sm or in the mssm  and this for a higgs mass possibly well below 114  gev , but still compatible with lep constraints due to the reduced higgs coupling to the @xmath11 boson .",
    "another feature allowing to distinguish the nmssm from the mssm could be the mass of the mostly sm - like higgs boson @xmath30 . if this state is the lightest among all nmssm cp - even higgs bosons , the upper bound on its mass is about @xmath15  gev @xcite for @xmath126 ( at the boundary of validity of perturbation theory below the gut scale ) , low @xmath47 and @xmath127 such that the negative term @xmath34 in ( [ eq:4 ] ) is small .",
    "however , the mostly sm - like higgs boson can well be the next - to - lightest cp - even state @xmath128 in the nmssm ( see chapter  2 ) , in which case its mass can be larger @xcite due to a positive term @xmath34 in ( [ eq:4 ] ) .",
    "then its reduced coupling @xmath129 to electroweak gauge bosons is necessarily smaller than  1 , in fact @xmath130 decreases with increasing @xmath131 .    in table  1",
    "we show three examples of this behaviour , corresponding to @xmath132 and 150  gev two - loop corrections as in @xcite .",

    "note that @xmath138 ; the third cp - even higgs boson with a mass of about 950  gev has @xmath139 for the points shown in table  1 .",
    "the value @xmath140 for @xmath141  gev seems large at first sight ; however , precisely for this mass range the lep bounds are particularly weak @xcite and allow for @xmath56 . for completeness",
    "we also show in table  1 the branching ratios of the more visible state @xmath128 .",
    "the state @xmath136 would be extremely difficult to observe at the lhc as it decays nearly exclusively into @xmath142 ; its branching ratios into @xmath125 are @xmath143 , and into @xmath144 about 0.09 .",
    ".three examples of scenarios where the state @xmath128 corresponds to the most sm - like higgs boson @xmath30 with a mass @xmath145  gev .",
    "we show its reduced couplings @xmath135 to electroweak gauge bosons , its branching fractions , the mass @xmath146 of the lighter more singlet - like state as well as its reduced coupling @xmath147 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in various regions of the parameter space of the nmssm , the properties of higgs bosons are clearly distinct from the mssm : a completely sm - like higgs boson can have a mass up to 140  gev , and a dominantly sm - like higgs boson ( with somewhat reduced couplings to electroweak gauge bosons ) can be heavier . in this case",
    "this higgs boson has a non - vanishing singlet component , and is necessarily accompagnied by a lighter state which is equally a doublet - singlet admixture with a mass and couplings typically allowed by lep constraints .",
    "in other regions of the parameter space , branching ratios into two photons can be enhanced due to a strong suppression of the partial width into @xmath142 .    in spite of numerous studies of higgs - to - higgs decays ,",
    "a no - lose theorem could not be established up to now . for @xmath82  gev ,",
    "the most promising studies in @xcite on the @xmath148 final state must be confirmed with respect to the assumed @xmath63-tagging efficiencies , mistaggings and backgrounds by studies including detector simulations .",
    "the latter are also required for the analyses of the gluonic decays for @xmath62 around 10  gev in @xcite , where the study of jet substructures requires measurements of invariant masses of very slim ( but very boosted ) jets . for @xmath87  gev and dominant",
    "@xmath149 decays , the studies in @xcite seem promising , whereas the qcd background assumed in the analysis of the @xmath150 final state in @xcite needs to be confirmed .",
    "background and detector simulations are also required for the proposals for direct @xmath12 production in @xcite , where the significance of the signal rates depend on model parameters as @xmath47 .",
