    "the attention towards the symmetric coupling of angular momenta started half a century ago @xcite : in the late nineties , an essentially equivalent problem attracted the keen interest in spin network theories , of great relevance in current approaches to quantum gravity , see references in @xcite , where of extreme importance is the formulation of a quantum mechanical volume operator and the study of its properties .",
    "the intimate connection between the two formulations was later established @xcite .",
    "mathematical advances regarded relationships with continuous and discrete orthogonal polynomials , their askey scheme classification , the quadratic and cubic algebras ( see @xcite ) , the leonard pairs and triples ( see @xcite and later papers by terwilliger ) .",
    "progress in angular momentum theory has mainly regarded semiclassical asymptotics of @xmath0 symbols @xcite , also illuminating regarding the geometrical aspects . for the latter in this paper we will particularly make reference to projective viewpoints @xcite ) .",
    "applications to atomic , molecular and nuclear physics have been intensive ; computational aspects have been discussed recently ( see previous papers in this series @xcite ) . at times , the investigators in these areas carried out their research without exchanges among them and using different formalisms , making it difficult the appreciation and utilization from communities of applied physical , chemical and in general computational scientists . here",
    "we try to partially fill this gap by giving the basic formulations , and then illustrations of the perspective emerging from very recent progress through presentation and discussion of computational results .",
    "next section [ s2 ] outlines the relevant formulation ; section [ s3 ] reports results of calculations of caustics and ridges , of interest for semiclassical analysis , and of the potentials @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the volume operator , which acts democratically on the 7-spin network .",
