    "experiments for the past several decades require modification of the standard model to incorporate the unexpected neutrino properties and fundamental characteristics  @xcite .",
    "for instance , neutrino flavor mixing was found to be responsible for the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation  @xcite occurring between three generations in which a complex phase ( @xmath1 ) signifies the amount of violation of the charge - parity ( cp ) symmetry , which is unknown .",
    "the sign of the mass difference , @xmath2 , which represents the ordering of the mass eigenstates , remains unknown as well .",
    "these two unknown parameters are intended to be addressed with the next generation of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the value of the mixing angle , @xmath3 , between the first generation and the third generation , was recently reported by the double chooz  @xcite , daya bay  @xcite and reno  @xcite collaborations to be large ( @xmath49@xmath5 ) .",
    "neutrino beam experiments can provide an independent check to verify the results reported by these reactor experiments .",
    "recent studies of neutrino properties using neutrino beams have demonstrated that good sensitivity to cp violation and mass hierarchy can be achieved by measuring @xmath6 appearance using a very long baseline @xmath7 beam with massive detectors  @xcite assuming the value of @xmath3 @xmath8 1@xmath5 .",
    "the recent measurements of @xmath3 made by minos and t2k show a non - zero value  @xcite .",
    "the most recent values of @xmath3 reported by reactor experiments show a big value of around 9@xmath5 that is particularly interesting to the measurements of cp violation and mass hierarchy .",
    "the proof of cp violation in the lepton sector and the knowledge of the value of @xmath1 are crucial to understanding the origin of the baryon asymmetry in the universe , providing a strong implication of leptogenesis that is responsible for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the neutrino mass hierarchy is of great importance for neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments  @xcite and could shed light on possible flavor symmetries .    when measuring the value of @xmath3 , cp phase , @xmath1 , and the neutrino mass hierarchy with conventional neutrino beams , a key process of new discovery in neutrino oscillation is @xmath9 appearance .",
    "with appropriate detector design and adequate control of environmental factors , specifically proper shielding , the long baseline neutrino experiment ( lbne )  @xcite is capable of supporting an extremely rich program of high energy physics and particle - astrophysics including proton decay , astronomical neutrinos , and tests of fundamental physics and the standard model .",
    "the two detector technologies being considered are : 1 ) an active finely grained liquid argon time - projection - chamber ( lar - tpc ) and 2 ) a water cerenkov detector .",
    "both detector technologies can support this wide range of physics goals probing the standard model and searching for physics beyond the current models .",
    "however , the muon - induced background may constrain the sensitivity of the proposed experiment , in particular , the proposed galactic and relic supernova neutrino detection with a liquid argon detector . though the background can be measured for beam neutrino physics with the beam - on or -off ,",
    "the fluctuation of background events can be problematic if these events occur on the same order of magnitude as the anticipated physics signal .",
    "in addition to the beam contamination backgrounds , the main sources are the muon - induced processes . in this paper , we report the study of the muon - induced background for an argon - based detector .",
    "muons and muon - induced fast neutrons entering the detector from the surrounding rock can cause troublesome experimental backgrounds . while through - going muon events in the detector have energy depositions and can be largely identified , a small fraction of the muon - induced energetic delta electrons and muons that traverse the rock near the detector , or traverse very small distances in the detector ( `` corner - clippers '' ) , can result in limiting backgrounds .",
    "moreover , background events can be produced by the muon - induced fast neutrons entering the detector while the parent muons pass completely through the surrounding in - active materials .",
    "the muon - induced neutrons can undergo ( n , p ) reaction with @xmath0ar , and negative muons capture on @xmath0ar .",
    "both reactions create unwanted @xmath0cl , which can be a background for the following reactions : @xmath10ar @xmath11cl , @xmath12ar@xmath13k , @xmath14ar @xmath15 @xmath14ar@xmath16 , and @xmath17 @xmath15 @xmath18 , where @xmath19 = @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "this is because the decay q value of @xmath0cl is 7.48 mev , which is above the proposed detection threshold of 5 mev or 6 mev , and the half - life of @xmath0cl is 1.35 minutes , making it difficult to correlate with muons .",
    "there can also be additional radioactive isotopes produced by muon - induced processes in the argon target .",
    "those radioactive isotopes can be part of the background for the proposed physics channels .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to evaluate the muon - induced processes and the production rate of the cosmogenics in the detector volume .    due to the lack of direct detection measurements of the muons and muon - induced products and parameters for a given depth with a given detector",
    ", such an evaluation has not been modelled in full . in this paper , we present several parametrization functions that estimate the muon - induced fast neutron energy spectrum and the stopping muons as a function of depth . using these parametrization functions",
    ", we simulated cosmogenic production rates in the proposed lbne lar detector for two depths with a well known geant4 package  @xcite , geant4.9.5 with shielding physics list .",
    "the simulated results were compared to the predictions by the developed analytic models .",
    "since the muon - induced processes are strongly depth dependent  @xcite , we establish a depth - sensitivity relation for an argon - based detector by calculating the production rate of cosmogenics as a function of depth .",
    "at sufficiently high energies , radiative processes become predominant in energy loss for muons .",
    "many sub - sequential particles can be produced by muon - induced radiative processes .",
    "the energetic delta electrons induced by muons in the ionization process can also undergo bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "cosmogenic radioactive isotopes can be produced by muons and muon - induced sequential particles including neutrons , protons , pions , gamma rays , etc .",
    "two cases are considered in the following evaluation : 1 ) muons transversing the detector and 2 ) muon - induced neutrons entering the detector from the experimental hall .",
    "the former process creates @xmath0cl and other radioactive isotopes through negative muon capture , ( n , p ) reaction , and ( p , n ) reaction , etc .",
    "the latter produces mainly @xmath0cl via ( n , p ) reaction alone . in order to understand the production rates and their corresponding mechanisms",
    ", we performed a full geant4 monte carlo simulation and developed analytic models .",
    "we elaborate on the evaluation processes in the following subsections .      high energy cosmic - ray muons can penetrate rock overburden to reach an underground laboratory with the surviving muons generating neutrons in the surrounding rock .",
    "those neutrons are unwanted particles that could produce background events for low - background experiments searching for rare event physics .",
    "the intensities of the residual muons and the muon - induced neutrons depend strongly on the depth of the underground detector .",
    "this is particularly important for detecting supernova neutrinos that contribute to a signal range of a few mev to a few tens of mev , which can often be dominated by the muon - induced backgrounds depending on the depth .",
    "therefore , the depth - sensitivity relation needs to be understood in order to choose an appropriate depth at the sanford underground research facility ( surf ) to estimate the experimental limitations imposed by these backgrounds and to optimize the detector design for the full range of possible physics programs .",
    "because both the 800-ft level and the 4850-ft level are being considered for a far detector , we have conducted geant4 monte carlo simulations to understand the cosmogenic production in the detector at both levels .    in the geant4 simulation , a simple geometry with a dimension of liquid argon , 45.6 m ( width ) @xmath23 22.4 m ( length ) @xmath23 14.0 m ( height )  @xcite , was placed in a stainless steel container with a thickness of 1 cm .",
    "both muons and neutrons were generated on a very thin sheet of air ( 100 m ( width ) @xmath23 50 m ( length ) @xmath230.01 m ( thickness ) ) right above the upper surface of the stainless steel tank .",
    "since the thin sheet is two times larger than the size of the detector in length and width , both muons and neutrons generated in the sheet can enter the detector with angular distribution of @xmath24 .",
    "there is a wide range of thetas that are enabled by taking a large production sheet and better represent the range of anticipated underground muons .",
    "note that we assume the parent muons and daughter neutrons have the same angular distribution .",
    "the residual muon energy spectrum was obtained from  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a normalization constant determined using the differential muon intensity at a specific depth , @xmath27 is the muon energy after traversing the rock slant depth @xmath28 ( km.w.e ) , and the parameters are @xmath29km.w.e , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 gev  @xcite .",
    "the differential muon intensity used to solve for the normalization constant , @xmath26 , is given by  @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 the vertical depth ( km.w.e ) .",
    "the units of @xmath34 are @xmath35s@xmath36 which is appropriate in the flat - earth approximation  @xcite .",
    "the muon - induced neutron energy spectrum is given by the parametrization fitting function  @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a normalization constant , @xmath39 is the neutron energy , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are fitted parameters , and @xmath42 is a function of muon energy with @xmath27 in gev , @xmath43 this parametrization is valid for @xmath44 mev and consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , these equations can not be directly used to generate neutrons for a given depth without knowing the associated parameters .",
    "we adopt the following procedures to obtain the neutron energy spectrum as a function of depth .",
    "first , the average neutron energy as a function of depth was studied using the simulated results for various depths in tables i and vii from ref .",
    "@xcite and a measured surface data point from ref .",
    "the relevant information is displayed in table  [ tab : aveneu ] and table  [ tab : aveneu1 ] .",
    ".the average neutron energy measured on the surface  @xcite and at various underground sites  @xcite , and the equivalent vertical depth relative to a flat overburden . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in table  [ tab : nprate1 ] , the predicted production rates using the analytic models agree with the geant4 simulation within 30% for the 800-ft level and less than 1% for the 4850-ft level .",
    "this is because the angular dependence of neutrons , @xmath45 , used in the analytic models works better at large depth  @xcite .",
    "lack of proper neutron angular distribution for shallow depths results in a slightly large discrepancy in the production rates between the analytic models and the geant4 simulation .",
    "note that the analytic calculation offers only a crosschecking .",
    "the agreement between the monte carlo simulation and the analytic calculation indicates that similar physics processes are implemented .",
    "muon - induced processes and the cosmogenic radioactivity production depends strongly on the target and must be evaluated individually for the experiment . however , the production rate is proportional to muon flux , or neutron flux , and their interaction cross - section .",
    "the energy dependence of the total cross - section for all muon - induced radio - isotopes in the scintillator was evaluated assuming the power law  @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 varies from 0.50 to 0.93 with a weight mean value @xmath48 = 0.73@xmath490.10  @xcite . for a given number of target atoms @xmath50 and the cross - section @xmath51 at the earth surface where the average muon energy is about 4 gev , the muon - induced cosmogenic radioactivity ( @xmath52 ) depends on the differential muon energy spectrum @xmath53/@xmath54 at the experimental site at a depth @xmath33 , @xmath55 as a simplification",
    ", the production rate is written as a function of the average muon energy @xmath56 at a depth @xmath33  @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total muon flux at the experimental site and @xmath59 = 0.87 @xmath49 0.03 is the correction factor for the averaging of @xmath27  @xcite . for a given detector target and a depth ,",
    "the cosmogenic production rate as a function of depth is thus obtained @xmath60",
    "lbne is an extremely rich physics program that will measure neutrino properties using a neutrino beam . in addition",
    ", lbne will also measure supernova neutrinos and proton decays .",
    "each of these physics channels has its unique signal region in terms of energy distribution .",
    "for example , measuring the parameters of neutrino oscillation with a neutrino beam has an energy region from 1 to 8 gev while the energy region of proton decay ranges from 100 to 938 mev .",
    "the signal of supernova neutrinos resides between 5 to 50 mev .",
    "it is difficult to establish a depth - sensitivity relation for all physics channels using a single plot .",
    "we elaborate on the muon - induced backgrounds for each of the physics channels below .      utilizing the above formulas , the muon and the muon - induced neutron rates as a function of depth can be shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neurate ] .",
    "it is clear that the event rates decrease rapidly when the depth increases .",
    "the fluctuation of muon and the muon - induced neutron rates from seasonal variation can result in backgrounds for all physics channels depending on the depth .",
    "the lbne experiment intends to use an accelerator with a cycle time of 1.33 seconds for a proton pulse of 10 @xmath21s  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lifetime of a neutrino beam is about 237 seconds per year .",
    "the relevant muon - induced processes that are backgrounds to the beam physics are the events falling in the energy region of 1 to 8 gev within the drift time of the detector for neutrino beam events .",
    "the coincidence rate of muons and the muon - induced processes with the neutrino beam spills as a function of depth is calculated assuming a drift time of 2 ms .",
    "[ fig : coin ] displays the result .",
    "it is clear that a rejection power of  10@xmath61 is needed if the detector is built on the surface with a depth of 5 m.w.e .",
    "note that the coincidence rate shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coin ] does not apply any rejection power .",
    "the cosmogenic production rate also decreases with increasing depth . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : cross5 ] shows the @xmath0cl production rate as a function of depth .",
    "the cosmogenic produced radioactive isotopes can be backgrounds for the detection of relic supernova neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino beam - induced neutral current and charge current @xmath62 productions are important backgrounds to the @xmath6 appearance .",
    "however , @xmath62 can also be produced by muons and muon - induced neutrons in the detector .",
    "[ fig : pion0k ] shows the energy deposition from @xmath62 events created by fast neutrons in the detector .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there are also multiple @xmath62 events along the neutron track .",
    "the production of @xmath62 as a function of depth is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion0 ] .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath62 produced by fast neutrons entering the detector can be a significant background to the beam physics program .",
    "this is because the fluctuation of the @xmath62 production due to the seasonal variation of muon flux and neutron flux results in a level of 22 @xmath62 events per year in the detector .",
    "in addition , the statistical fluctuation of the @xmath62 has a similar level of 33 @xmath62 events .",
    "adding both in quadratic , the level of fluctuation in the production of @xmath62 can be about 40 events per year .",
    "this is significant even at the 4850-ft level .",
    "depending on the capability of discriminating single @xmath62 events between the beam neutrino - induced and the cosmic neutron - induced , a greater depth ( 7400-ft level ) can be an effective option to further reduce this background .",
    "the @xmath6 appearance is essential to the measurements of neutrino properties with a neutrino beam .",
    "the anticipated signal in a 20 kton lar detector is about 75 events per year  @xcite .",
    "muons and the muon - induced processes can generate @xmath6-like events in the detector through the following : 1 ) the production of energetic delta electrons in the ionization process , which are very hard to reject using the reconstruction of muon tracks , because a fraction of them do not even have the parent muon tracks associated with them ; 2 ) muon - induced bremsstrahlung radiation , pair production , and @xmath62 ; 3 ) high energy neutrons from the surrounding materials ; and 4 ) high - energy gamma rays produced by muon bremsstrahlung radiation in the surrounding materials .",
    "the muon - induced backgrounds can be measured with the beam - off . however , the fluctuation of background events resulting from statistical and seasonal variation is a main source of background .",
    "this background as a function of depth is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] , the depth must be greater than 4.0 km.w.e . in order to have a reasonable measurement of @xmath6 appearance at surf .",
    "we evaluate the muon - induced background as a function of depth for a long baseline neutrino experiment with liquid argon as the target at different levels of the sanford underground research facility at homestake mine .",
    "both geant4 simulations and analytic methods are employed in the evaluation of background event rates in the region of interest using the available muon and neutron energy spectra from ref .",
    "@xcite and the measured muon flux from ref .",
    "the muon and muon - induced neutron rates are calculated for the energy greater than 5 mev .",
    "the production of energetic delta electrons in the ionization process is found to be the most important muon - induced @xmath6-like events for the beam physics .",
    "the cosmogenic processes are discussed in detail for negative muon capture , ( n , p ) , and ( p , n ) reactions .",
    "the dominant backgrounds are from both stopping muons and the high energy neutrons generated by muons in the surrounding materials and in the target . in summary , the background sources are : 1 ) the negative stopping muon capture ; 2 ) the neutron ( n , p ) , ( n , d),(n , t ) , ( n,@xmath47 ) , etc ; and 3 ) the muon - induced energetic delta electrons and showers , in particular high energy delta electrons , @xmath62 production , and high energy gamma rays . the cosmogenic production rate as a function of depth is evaluated for negative stopping muon capture and fast neutrons separately . as can be seen from the above discussion",
    ", the cosmogenic production rate induced by the muon - induced processes reduces three orders of magnitude when the depth is larger than 4.0 km.w.e .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : capture ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cross5 ] that the @xmath0cl production is less than 100 per day when the depth is greater than 4.0 km.w.e .",
    "we conclude the following :    * the 800-ft level presents large background events for beam - related neutrino physics because the muon rate ( @xmath488 hz ) is still high and the @xmath6-like events produced by the muon - induced energetic delta electrons are in the order of a few thousand per year . though lar tpc is better in identifying @xmath62 events compared to a water cerenkov detector  @xcite , the @xmath62 produced by muons seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pion0 ] is three orders of magnitude higher than the expected signal .",
    "a rejection power of 1000 is needed , which is contingent on the capability of discriminating single @xmath62 events between the beam neutrino - induced and the cosmic neutron - induced .",
    "an alternative approach is a greater depth ( 7400-ft level ) to further reduce this background . *",
    "the 800-ft level possesses difficulty in detecting supernova neutrinos for a galactic supernova neutrino burst with a time window of 30 seconds at 10 kpc .",
    "this is because the expected charge current events in a 20 kton detector used in the simulation from such a burst are about 1300 events  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to about 44 hz .",
    "however , the total muon - induced rate is about 88 hz at this level .",
    "the signal is immersed in background .",
    "in addition , the frequency of galactic supernovae occurs at a level of once per 50 years  @xcite . *",
    "the muon - induced processes are backgrounds for an argon - based detector in the detection of relic supernova neutrinos with a depth less than 4.0 km.w.e . with a 20 kton detector",
    ", we expect less than 30 events per year from relic supernova neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the relic supernova neutrinos can be detected with the accumulation of the detector lifetime . *   fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] shows a depth requirement for the @xmath6 appearance from a neutrino beam .",
    "it is clear that a meaningful measurement of cp violation can only be accomplished when the depth is greater than 4.0 km.w.e . *",
    "finally , positioning a lar detector near the surface , i.e. at nova depths , will increase the backgrounds by three orders of magnitude , compromising the direct @xmath63 program .",
    "[ fig : nova ] shows a simulated result for the nova depth . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nova ] , the signal from a supernova burst is completely immersed by the neutron induced background . +     therefore , a depth larger than 4.0 km.w.e . is needed for an argon - based detector . the 4850-ft level at homestake mine would be a good home for this detector .",

    "<S> we evaluated rates of transversing muons , muon - induced fast neutrons , and production of @xmath0cl and other cosmogenically produced nuclei that pose as potential sources of background to the physics program proposed for an argon - based long baseline neutrino experiment at the sanford underground research facility ( surf ) , homestake mine , lead , sd . </S>",
    "<S> the geant4 simulations were carried out with muons and muon - induced neutrons for both the 800-ft level ( 0.712 km.w.e . ) and 4850-ft level ( 4.3 km.w.e . ) . </S>",
    "<S> we developed analytic models to independently calculate the @xmath0cl production using the measured muon fluxes at different levels of the homestake mine . </S>",
    "<S> the muon induced @xmath0cl production rates through stopped muon capture and the muon - induced neutrons and protons via ( n , p ) and ( p , n ) reactions were evaluated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the monte carlo simulated production rates of @xmath0cl agree well with the predictions from analytic models . </S>",
    "<S> a depth - dependent parametrization was developed and benchmarked to the direct analytic models . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the muon - induced processes will result in large backgrounds to the physics proposed for an argon - based long baseline neutrino experiment at a depth of less than 4.0 km.w.e . </S>"
