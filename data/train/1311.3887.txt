    "recently , there has been renewed interest in finding suitable quantum generalizations of rnyi s  @xcite entropies and divergences .",
    "this is due to the fact that rnyi entropies and divergences have a wide range of applications in classical information theory and cryptography , see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we will review some of the recent progress here , but refer the reader to  @xcite for a more in - depth discussion . for our purposes ,",
    "a quantum system is modeled by a finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the set of positive semi - definite operators on that hilbert space , and by @xmath2 the subset of density operators with unit trace .    the following natural quantum generalization of the rnyi divergence has been widely used and has found operational significance , for example , as a cut - off rate in quantum hypothesis testing  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it is usually referred to as _ quantum rnyi relative entropy _ and for all @xmath3 given as @xmath4 for arbitrary @xmath5 , @xmath6 that satisfy @xmath7 .",
    "( the notation @xmath7 means that @xmath8 dominates @xmath9 , i.e.  the kernel of @xmath8 lies inside the kernel of @xmath9 . )    while this definition has proven useful in many applications , it has a major drawback in that it does not satisfy the data - processing inequality ( dpi ) for @xmath10 .",
    "the dpi states that the quantum rnyi relative entropy is contractive under application of a quantum channel , i.e. , @xmath11\\big\\|\\mathcal{e}[\\sigma]\\big ) \\leq d_{\\alpha}(\\rho\\|\\sigma)$ ] for any completely positive trace - preserving map @xmath12 .",
    "intuitively , this property is very desirable since we want to think of the divergence as a measure of how well @xmath9 can be distinguished from @xmath8 , and this can only get more difficult after a channel is applied .",
    "recently , an alternative quantum generalization has been investigated  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it is referred to as _ quantum rnyi divergence _ ( or sandwiched rnyi relative entropy in  @xcite ) and defined as @xmath13 for all @xmath3 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 that satisfy @xmath7 .",
    "the quantum rnyi divergence has found operational significance in the converse part of quantum hypothesis testing  @xcite . as such",
    ", it satisfies the dpi for all @xmath14 as was shown by frank and lieb  @xcite and independently by beigi  @xcite for @xmath15 .",
    "see also earlier work  @xcite where a different proof is given for @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , the quantum rnyi divergence has already proven an indispensable tool , for example in the study of strong converse capacities of quantum channels  @xcite .",
    "the definitions ,   and  , are in general different but coincide when @xmath9 and @xmath8 commute . for @xmath17 , we define @xmath18 and @xmath19 as the corresponding limit . for @xmath20 it has been shown that  @xcite : @xmath21 with the eigenvalue decomposition @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 the projector on the support of @xmath9 . in the limit @xmath25 both expressions converge to the quantum relative entropy  @xcite , namely @xmath26 for @xmath27 the limits have been evaluated in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively : @xmath28 with the eigenvalue decompositions @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    it has been observed  @xcite that the relation @xmath31 follows from the araki - lieb - thirring trace inequality  @xcite . furthermore , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are monotonically increasing functions . for the latter quantity ,",
    "this was shown in  @xcite and independently in  @xcite .",
    "finally , very recently audenaert and datta  @xcite defined a more general two parameter family of _ @xmath34-z - relative rnyi entropies _ of the form @xmath35 and explored some of its properties .",
    "we clearly have @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we will in the following consider disjoint quantum systems , denoted by capital letters @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the sets @xmath40 and @xmath41 take on the expected meaning .",
    "the conditional von neumann entropy can be conveniently defined in terms of the quantum relative entropy as follows . for a bipartite state @xmath42",
    ", we define @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the usual von neumann entropy .",
    "the last equality can be verified using the relation @xmath45 together with the fact that @xmath46 is positive definite .    in the case of rnyi entropies , it is not immediate which expression , , or  , should be used to define the conditional rnyi entropies .",
    "it has been found in the study of the classical special case ( see , e.g.  @xcite for an overview ) that generalizations based on   have severe limitations , for example they can not be expected to satisfy a dpi . on the other hand , definitions based on the underlying divergence , as in   or  , have proven to be very fruitful and lead to quantities with operational significance .",
    "together with the two proposed quantum generalizations of the rnyi divergence in   and  , this leads to a total of four different candidates for conditional rnyi entropies . for @xmath47 and @xmath42",
    ", we define @xmath48    the fully quantum entropy @xmath49 has first been studied in  @xcite . for the classical and classical - quantum special case this quantity gives a generalization of the leftover hashing lemma  @xcite for the modified mutual information to rnyi entropies with @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the classical version of @xmath51 was introduced by arimoto for an evaluation of the guessing probability  @xcite .",
    "we note that he used another but equivalent expression for @xmath51 that we later explain in lemma  [ lm : dau - new ] .",
    "then , gallager used @xmath51 ( again in the form of lemma  [ lm : dau - new ] ) to upper bound the decoding error probability of a random coding scheme for data compression with side - information  @xcite .",
    "the classical and classical - quantum special cases of @xmath51 were , for example , also investigated in  @xcite and realize another type of a generalization of the leftover hashing lemma for the @xmath52-distinguishability in the study of randomness extraction to rnyi entropies with @xmath50 .",
    "it follows immediately from the definition and the corresponding property of @xmath53 that these two entropies satisfy a data - processing inequality .",
    "namely for any quantum operation @xmath54 with @xmath55 $ ] and any @xmath56 $ ] , we have @xmath57 while their classical - quantum versions have been obtained in  @xcite .",
    "the conditional entropy @xmath58 was proposed in  @xcite and investigated in  @xcite , whereas @xmath59 is first considered in this paper .",
    "( since the relative entropies @xmath60 and @xmath53 are identical for commuting operators , we note that @xmath61 as well as @xmath62 for classical distributions . )",
    "both definitions satisfy the above data - processing inequality for @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to verify that all entropies considered are invariant under applications of local isometries on either the @xmath63 or @xmath64 systems .",
    "lastly , note that the optimization over @xmath65 can always be restricted to @xmath66 for @xmath15 .",
    "we use up and down arrows to express the trivial observation that @xmath67 and @xmath68 by definition . finally ,   gives us the additional relations @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "these relations are summarized in figure  [ fig : overview ] . moreover , inheriting these properties from the corresponding divergences , all entropies are monotonically decreasing functions of @xmath34    for @xmath71 , all definitions coincide with the usual von neumann conditional entropy  . for @xmath72 ,",
    "two quantum generalizations of the conditional min - entropy emerge , which both have been studied by renner  @xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath73 ( the notation @xmath74 and @xmath75 is widely used .",
    "however , we prefer our notation as it makes our exposition in this manuscript clearer . ) for @xmath76 , we find a quantum generalization of the conditional collision entropy as introduced by renner  @xcite : @xmath77 for @xmath78 , we find the quantum conditional max - entropy first studied by knig _",
    "et al . _",

    "it is well known that , for any tripartite pure state @xmath85 , the relation @xmath86 holds .",

    "the purpose of the following is thus to show if a similar relation holds for the remaining two candidates , @xmath51 and @xmath59 .",
