    "their internal structure has been at the center of nuclear and particle physics for decades . similar to atomic nuclei ,",
    "nucleons are complex systems of confined quarks and gluons and exhibit characteristic spectra of excited states that encode information on symmetry properties of baryonic matter .",
    "highly excited nucleon states ( @xmath14 ) are sensitive to details of quark confinement , which is poorly understood within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory of strong interactions",
    ". measurements of excited nucleon states are needed to come to a better understanding of how confinement works in nucleons .",
    "the clustering of quarks in the nucleon can lead to an excitation spectrum with fewer states than if quarks do not cluster . the @xmath14 states couple strongly to the meson - baryon continuum to form nucleon resonances of characteristic masses and decay widths , and can be most effectively investigated by using meson production reactions on the nucleon . with the high precision electron beam and the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) in hall b ,",
    "jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) has developed an excited baryon program and has made important contributions in this direction .",
    "the excited baryon program at jlab has two main objectives .",
    "the first one is to provide information from electromagnetic probes to improve our understanding of the systematics of the @xmath14 spectrum and the nature of the effective degrees of freedom in low energy qcd .",
    "the second objective is to measure the resonance transition form factors from the nucleon ground state to the excited baryon states .",
    "these measurements probe the internal structure of excited states and provide information about the confining forces of the 3-quark system and the spatial distribution of quarks in the transverse plane .",
    "the experimental program makes wide use of the clas detector  @xcite , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : clas ] .",
    "clas provides particle detection and identification , as well as momentum analysis in a polar angle range from 8@xmath15 to 140@xmath15 .",
    "for operation of energy - tagged photon beams , the photon energy tagging facility provides photons with an energy resolution of @xmath16 , and covers an energy range from 20% to 95% of the incident electron beam energy .",
    "other equipment essential for the @xmath14 program includes the coherent bremsstrahlung facility that has been used to produce linearly polarized photons with polarizations up to 90% .",
    "there are also two frozen - spin polarized targets , one using butanol as target material for polarized protons ( frost ) , and the other using hd as an efficient neutron target ( hd - ice ) .",
    "frost has been operated successfully in longitudinal polarization mode , in conjunction with linearly and circularly polarized photons , and is planned to be used in transverse polarization mode in 2010 .",
