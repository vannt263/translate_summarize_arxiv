    "our knowledge of the neutrino ( @xmath0 ) flavor transition in a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) has encountered a paradigm shift in the recent years .",
    "it was pointed out ( for an incomplete list , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) that in the deep region of the core where neutrino densities are large , neutrino self - interaction could result in significant flavor conversion that is totally distinct in nature from the well - known mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite , which instead arises from the interaction of neutrinos with the ordinary stellar medium .",
    "the intense study has suggested that coherent @xmath1 forward scatterings may lead to collective pair conversion @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) over the entire energy range even with extremely small mixing angles .",
    "it was also pointed out that in a typical supernova , this type of flavor conversion would take place near @xmath4 km , in contrast to that for the msw effect at @xmath5 km .",
    "in addition , the development of the collective effects depends crucially on the primary @xmath0 spectra @xcite , as well as on the @xmath0 mass hierarchy .",
    "one would thus expect non - trivial modifications to the original sn @xmath0 fluxes as they propagate outward .",
    "in general , the self - induced flavor conversion does not alter both @xmath0 and @xmath6 spectra under the normal hierarchy ( nh ) .",
    "however , it leads to the nearly complete spectra exchange @xmath7 and a partial swap of the spectra , @xmath8 , at a critical energy under the inverted hierarchy ( ih ) .",
    "the rich physical content , in a sense , leads to further theoretical uncertainties which complicate the interpretation of the observed sn @xmath0 bursts and the unknown properties of @xmath0 that may be revealed by the observation .    with the unique production and detection processes , the neutrino burst from a sn has long been considered as one of the promising tools for the study of neutrino parameters and the sn mechanism .",
    "a core - collapse sn emits all three flavors of neutrino with a characteristic energy range and a time scale that are totally distinct from those of the neutrinos emitted from the sun , the atmosphere , and terrestrial sources .",
    "it has been suggested ( see , i.e. , ref.@xcite ) that analyzing sn neutrino bursts may provide hints to the unknown elements of the neutrino mass and mixing matrices . with the recent pin - down of the last mixing angle @xmath9 @xcite , the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy may seem the next reachable goal .",
    "recent study based on multi - angle analysis of sn neutrinos @xcite , however , pointed out that the seemingly dominating collective effects may be suppressed by the dense matter during the accretion phase following the core bounce @xcite .",
    "this time - dependent variation of the neutrino survival probability during the early phase ( post - bounce times @xmath10s ) would give rise to a new interpretation of the observed neutrino flux and hints to the @xmath0 properties , such as the mass hierarchy .",
    "focused on this issue , we analyze the expected sn @xmath0 events during the early accretion phase at earth - bound detectors through two channels of neutrino interactions : @xmath11 in the water cherenkov detector ( wc ) or the scintillation detector ( sc ) , and @xmath12 in the liquid argon chamber ( ar ) .",
    "given the uncertainties among the sn models , we propose observables that may be useful in the determination of the @xmath0 mass hierarchy .",
    "the outcomes with different incident angles at the detectors are also compared .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we outline the recent progress on the measured neutrino mixing angles , the squared mass differences , and the general features of the neutrino fluxes emitted by a core - collapse supernova .",
    "the known parameters will be adopted as the input for the calculation .",
    "section iii is devoted to investigating the modification of the primary neutrino fluxes by the collective effect , the msw effect , and the earth regeneration effect . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "the calculation is based on a two - layer model for the earth matter . in section",
    "iv , we propose physical observables that may provide hints to identifying the neutrino mass hierarchy and a working scenario for flavor transition due to self - interaction .",
    "expected trends of the event rates at the wc , sc , and ar detectors are estimated and discussed .",
    "results arising from varied incident angles at the detectors under different sn models are also discussed .",
    "we then summarize this work in section v.",
    "the three mixing angles in the @xmath0 mixing matrix have been determined with convincing precision @xcite : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the mass - squared differences also have been measured : @xmath16 ev@xmath17 , @xmath18 ev@xmath17 .",
    "the absolute neutrino mass , the cp phase in the neutrino sector , and the neutrino mass hierarchy are yet to be determined .",
    "the primary sn neutrino energy spectrum is typically not pure thermal , and can be modeled as a pinched fermi - dirac distribution @xcite . for each neutrino flavor @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 + 1},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the number flux of @xmath19 , with @xmath23 the energy luminosity and @xmath24 the mean neutrino energy .",
    "@xmath25 is the effective temperature of @xmath19 inside the respective neutrinosphere , @xmath26 is the normalization factor , and @xmath27 is the pinching parameter . note that another widely adopted parametrization is given by , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite .    in general , equipartition of the luminosity among the primary neutrino flavors",
    "is expected in typical sn simulations , @xmath28 , which is assumed in our calculation for the neutrino fluxes during the accretion phase .",
    "note , however , that variations from this nearly degenerate scenario are also suggested in the literature , e.g. , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . as input parameters ,",
    "the effective temperatures are fixed in this work : @xmath32 mev , @xmath33 mev , and @xmath34 mev .",
    "in addition , the pinching parameters are taken to be @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "despite the variation of sn models , the consensus seems to suggest a partial to complete modification ( depending on the mass hierarchy ) of the neutrino primary spectra by the collective effect , which occurs near @xmath4 km as the neutrinos propagate outwards .",
    "the msw effect then takes place at @xmath38 km .",
    "the two effects are considered to be independent because of the wide separation in space .",
    "the neutrino fluxes get further modification by the earth matter before their detection . as far as the @xmath0 properties are concerned , the advantage of analyzing the @xmath0 bursts at an early stage is conspicuous . the complicated shock wave does not play a role in the flavor conversion during this early accretion phase @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon , however , becomes more complicated during the later cooling phase when the shock wave is taken into consideration .",
    "moreover , while the @xmath39 and @xmath40 spectra are expected to be well separated in the early phase , they tend to become indistinguishable later during the cooling phase , and the flavor conversion effect for the @xmath39 channel becomes difficult to observe .",
    "recent simulations suggest quite diverse features for the details of the collective effects . in table",
    "i , we summarize the possible scenarios resulting from the collective effects under both the normal ( nh ) and the inverted ( ih ) hierarchies , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the survival probabilities of the original @xmath43 and @xmath39 fluxes , respectively , after the adjustment of the @xmath44 self - induced collective effects",

    "the three later cases differ in the expected @xmath39 flux .",
    "case ( b ) represents partial matter suppression of the collective effect , and the survival probability is time dependent : @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "case ( c ) represents a total swap of the spectra @xmath7 : @xmath53 . in this case",
    ", the self - induced effect dominates over the msw effect , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we add in our analysis the case ( d ) , which indicates a complete matter suppression of the collective effect : @xmath46 .",
    "this corresponds to the traditional treatment of the sn @xmath0 flux based on the pure msw effect , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "note that in our calculation for scenario ( b ) , we adopt an approximate probability function @xmath54 ( as shown in fig.1 ) , which is fitted by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . formulating the neutrino fluxes at different stages",
    "is straightforward .",
    "the primary neutrino fluxes are denoted by @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",

    "continue to propagate outwards , they encounter a further modification by the msw effect in the sn .",
    "if one denotes the survival probability for @xmath43 ( @xmath39 ) after the msw effect as @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) , then the fluxes of @xmath43 and @xmath39 arriving at earth can be written as @xmath65 @xmath66 with @xmath67 @xmath68 for the normal hierarchy , and @xmath69 @xmath70 for the inverted hierarchy . here ,",

    "furthermore , we have set vanishing crossing probabilities in writing the above expressions : @xmath87 .",
    "in contrast to the matter density profile with @xmath88 in the traditional treatment , it has been pointed out @xcite that a local deviation of the uncertain density profile from @xmath88 may lead to significant change of the msw crossing probabilities for a certain range of @xmath9 .",
    "this factor has been taken into consideration in our analysis . with the recent determination of the relatively large @xmath9",
    ", we conclude that the vanishing crossing probabilities can be adopted even if the local density profiles near the resonance become as steep as @xmath89 .",

    "we first adopt the @xmath108 and @xmath6 fluxes during the early phase of a @xmath109 progenitor sn model , such as in ref.@xcite where the flux evolution during the accretion phase was given up to 0.6s after the core bounce .",

    "related topics , such as probing the neutrino parameters or analyzing the detectability of varied effects on the sn neutrinos , have also been widely discussed . to better clarify our motivation in this work and to distinguish our work from others , we briefly outline here the aims of similar studies in the literature :    * in choubey _",
    "@xcite , the expected neutrino signals resulting from varied flux models were calculated and the signatures , especially the patterns of spectral split , of the collective effects are examined .",
    "the flavor conversion during the accretion phase was also discussed .",
    "however , the possibility that very dense ordinary matter may suppress the collective conversion during the accretion phase , a consequence of the multi - angle analysis , was not included .",
    "the related discussion thus corresponds to distinguishing case ( a ) for the nh and case ( c ) for the ih in our paper .",
    "* the paper by borriello _",
    "@xcite aimed at the observability of the earth matter effect for sn neutrinos .",
    "the time - integrated spectra during part of the accretion phase and the cooling phase were taken as benchmarks for the calculation .",
    "for flavor conversion , the complete matter suppression of the collective effect was considered , and the neutrinos underwent only the dominant msw conversion in the sn .",
    "the related discussions correspond to separating case ( a ) and case ( d ) in our analysis . * in serpico _",
    "@xcite , the analysis was focused on probing the neutrino mass hierarchy with the neutrino signals at the icecube cherenkov detector .",
    "complete matter suppression of the collective effect during the early era of the accretion phase ( @xmath168 ) was considered . in this analysis",
    "the msw conversion also plays the dominant role .",
    "the related discussion thus corresponds to distinguishing case ( a ) and case ( d ) as in part of our analysis ( @xmath168 ) , but based on the outcome of a different detector .",
    "our approach differs from the above analyses mainly in that , as far as the influence of the collective effect is considered , we focus on the time - varying collective flavor conversion probability and the resultant time - dependent neutrino fluxes during the accretion phase , up to @xmath169 .",
    "thus , the possible consequences due to ( i ) a complete suppression of the collective effect , ( ii ) a partial suppression of the collective effect , and ( iii ) a large collective effect are all discussed .",
    "given the current situation that uncertainty still remains in the mechanism of the collective effect , our discussion covers the scope that allows model uncertainties in the time structures of the flavor conversion and the fluxes .",
    "furthermore , our analysis was established based on a conservative assumption that the earth matter effect is beyond detectable . more precisely , observing a specific effect , such as the collective effect or the earth matter effect , is not the main issue in our paper and is irrelevant to our aim , although it could be crucial to other analyses .",
    "in fact , it was suggested @xcite that observing the earth effect under a general situation may be more challenging than expected , and the optimistic view toward an identification of the neutrino mass hierarchy may need to be re - evaluated . in a sense , this may also suggest that one should try to avoid as many as possible the factors that may complicate the interpretation of the signals in probing the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "regardless of the observability of the earth matter effect , our analysis seems in agreement with this logic by establishing the qualitative properties that are unaffected by whether or not the earth matter effect can be singled out .",
    "it should be pointed out that the details of the time structure for the primary @xmath0 fluxes and their relative magnitude are , of course , model dependent .",
    "however , the general qualitative features do not vary much among the analyzed models , as discussed in sec .",
    "iv . as far as our purposes are concerned , the qualitative study should be able to provide moderate hints as an addition to those of the numerical studies that may suffer from model uncertainties and the experimental details involved .",
    "in addition , out of the three independent effects included in our calculation , the time - dependent collective effect plays a key role in our analysis because the variation of the expected outcome is determined almost entirely by the not - so - well understood collective effect . in this regard",
    ", we further analyze the time structure of the consequences resulting from different models .",
    "the results may also help shed light on identifying the working scenario of the collective effect in supernovae .",
    "we have assumed equipartitioned luminosity for the neutrino flavors , as mentioned in section ii .",
    "note that the relative magnitude of the luminosity may not remain the same during the later cooling phase . even in the case of a slight deviation from the equipartition during the accretion phase ,",
    "our qualitative analysis , which focuses on the trend of event rate in time , remains valid since the numerical details involved in the calculation do not alter the general pictures of the physical observables .",
    "our results suggest that not only the mass hierarchy , but also the sn mechanism related to the collective effect may , in principle , be resolved to certain extent by the observation of both @xmath0 and @xmath39 fluxes .",
    "however , this physics potential of observing sn neutrinos relies heavily on the resolution power of a detector and proper numerical analysis .",
    "a more detailed numerical study , which takes into consideration the possible consequences due to different models , variation of the luminosity strength , and the experimental details , would certainly be in high demand and shall be discussed elsewhere . in this work , we only estimate the qualitative properties of the observables .",
    "nevertheless , it is still hoped that analysis along this line would provide an alternative approach toward a better understanding of sn neutrinos , especially under the current situation that the model uncertainties exist and a comprehensive knowledge of sn physics is still lacking .",

    "we also thank chih - ching chen and tsung - che liu for discussions .",
    "we briefly summarize the derivations of eqs.(12 - 15 ) here . note , as mentioned in the text , that we have imposed the approximate conditions @xmath86 and @xmath87 in writing eqs.(12 - 15 ) from part of the following derivations .",
    "the original fluxes @xmath55 and @xmath56 in eq.(69 ) of ref.@xcite , @xmath170 should be respectively replaced by our @xmath75 ( eq.(2 ) ) and @xmath77 ( eq.(3 ) ) to account for the collective effect : @xmath171 where @xmath172 , as given by eq.(6 ) , is the @xmath43 flux arriving at earth .",
    "( [ eq : a2 ] ) leads directly to @xmath173 under the normal hierarchy , as given by eq.(12 ) , if one imposes the approximate conditions .",
    "in addition , since the conversion of @xmath43 is independent of @xmath71 under the inverted hierarchy , we may simply set @xmath174 in eq.(71 ) of ref.@xcite and use their eq.(69 ) to obtain the expression for @xmath173 under the inverted hierarchy .",
    "this leads to eq.(13 ) if one again replaces @xmath175 by @xmath176 .",
    "as for the @xmath39 flux at the detector under the normal hierarchy , we use eq.(79 ) of ref.@xcite and replace @xmath73 and @xmath177 respectively by @xmath76 ( eq.(4 ) ) and @xmath78 ( eq.(5 ) ) .",
    "this leads to the expression of @xmath178 in eq.(14 ) .",
    "note that the original flux of @xmath179 is usually set to be identical to that of @xmath40 , @xmath180 .",
    "finally , for the inverted hierarchy , the @xmath39 spectrum is the same as the normal one except for a suppression factor @xmath130 . in this case , @xmath178 in eq.(15 ) can be derived from eq.(106 ) of ref.@xcite by setting @xmath181 at the location where the @xmath0 flux enters the earth so that @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "explicitly , one may refer to , e.g. , eq.(27 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . following this line ,",
    "one reaches eq.(15 ) if @xmath184 there in ref.@xcite or @xcite is replaced by @xmath185 .",
