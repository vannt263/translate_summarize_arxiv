    "the motivation idea for studying higher dimensional black holes with a negative cosmological constant arises from the correspondence between the gravitating fields in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and conformal field theory living on the boundary of the ads spacetime @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the thermodynamics of black holes in ads spaces can be identified with that of a certain dual cft in the high temperature limit @xcite .",
    "having the ads / cft correspondence idea at hand , one can gain some insights into thermodynamic properties and phase structures of strong t hooft coupling cfts by studying thermodynamics of ads black holes .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the rotating black holes in ads space are dual to certain cfts in a rotating space @xcite , while charged ones are dual to cfts with chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the most general higher dimensional uncharged rotating black holes in ads space have been recently found haw , gib .",
    "as far as we know , rotating black holes for the maxwell field minimally coupled to einstein gravity in higher dimensions , do not exist in a closed form and one has to rely on perturbative or numerical methods to construct them in the background of asymptotically flat @xcite and ads @xcite spacetimes .",
    "there has also been recent interest in constructing the analogous charged rotating solutions in the framework of gauged supergravity in various dimensions @xcite .",
    "there has been a renewed interest in studying scalar coupled solutions of general relativity ever since new black hole solutions have been found in the context of string theory .",
    "the low energy effective action of string theory contains two massless scalars namely dilaton and axion .",
    "the dilaton field couples in a nontrivial way to other fields such as gauge fields and results into interesting solutions for the background spacetime cdb1,cdb2,hor2,hor3 .",
    "these solutions @xcite , however , are all asymptotically flat . the presence of liouville - type dilaton potential , which is regarded as the generalization of the cosmological constant , changes the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to be neither asymptotically flat nor ( a)ds . while in the presence of one or two liouville - type potential , black holes / branes which are neither asymptotically flat nor ( a)ds have been explored in @xcite , magnetic dilaton solutions coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics have also been investigated @xcite . although these kind of solutions may shed some light on the possible extensions of ads / cft correspondence , they are physically less interesting due to their unusual asymptotic behavior . recently , the dilaton potential leading to ( a)ds - like solutions of dilaton gravity has been found @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the cosmological constant is coupled to the dilaton in a very nontrivial way . with an appropriate combination of three liouville - type dilaton potentials ,",
    "a class of static dilaton black hole solutions in ( a)ds spaces has been obtained by using a coordinates transformation which recast the solution in the schwarzschild coordinates system @xcite .",
    "such potential may arise from the compactification of a higher dimensional supergravity model @xcite which originates from the low energy limit of a background string theory .",
    "more recently , one of us has constructed a class of magnetic rotating solutions in four - dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity with liouville - type potential in the background of ads spaces sheykhi2 .",
    "although these solutions are not black holes and represent spacetimes with conic singularities , asymptotically ads charged rotating black string solutions in four - dimensional einstein - maxwell - dilaton gravity has also been constructed @xcite .",
    "so far , exact higher dimensional charged rotating dilaton black hole / brane solutions for an arbitrary dilaton - electromagnetic coupling constant in the background of ads spacetime have not been constructed . in this paper we intend to construct exact , charged rotating dilaton black branes with cylindrical or toroidal horizons in higher dimensional ads spacetimes and investigate their properties .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section [ field ] is devoted to a brief review of the field equations and the general formalism of calculating the conserved quantities .",
    "we shall also present the suitable counterterm which removes the divergences of the action in the presence of the dilaton potential . in section [",
    "charged ] , we construct the @xmath0-dimensional charged rotating dilaton black branes with a complete set of rotation parameters and investigate their properties .",
    "we also obtain the conserved and thermodynamical quantities of the @xmath0-dimensional black brane solutions .",
    "we finish with conclusion in the last section .",
    "we consider the @xmath0-dimensional theory in which gravity is coupled to dilaton and maxwell field with an action @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the scalar curvature , @xmath3 is the dilaton field , @xmath4 is the electromagnetic field tensor , and @xmath5 is the electromagnetic potential .",
    "@xmath6 is an arbitrary constant governing the strength of the coupling between the dilaton and the maxwell field .",

    "it is required for the variational principle to be well - defined . the factor @xmath7 represents the trace of the extrinsic curvature for the boundary @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "is the induced metric on the boundary .",
    "while @xmath10 corresponds to the usual einstein - maxwell - scalar theory , @xmath11 indicates the dilaton - electromagnetic coupling that appears in the low energy string action in einstein s frame . for arbitrary value of @xmath6 in ( a)ds spaces the form of the dilaton potential in arbitrary dimensions",

    "we redefine @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the ads radius of spacetime .",
    "it is clear the cosmological constant is coupled to the dilaton in a very nontrivial way .",
    "this type of the dilaton potential was introduced for the first time by gao and zhang @xcite .",
    "they derived , by applying a coordinates transformation which recast the solution in the schwarzchild coordinates system , the static dilaton black hole solutions in the background of ( a)ds universe .",
    "for this purpose , they required the existence of the ( a)ds dilaton black hole solutions and extracted successfully the form of the dilaton potential leading to ( a)ds - like solutions .",
    "they also argued that this type of derived potential can be obtained when a higher dimensional theory is compactified to four dimension , including various supergravity models @xcite . in the absence of the dilaton field ( @xmath16 ) , the potential ( [ v1 ] ) reduces to @xmath17 , and the action ( [ act ] ) recovers the action of einstein - maxwell gravity with cosmological constant .",
    "the equations of motion can be obtained by varying the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to the gravitational field @xmath18 , the dilaton field @xmath19 and the gauge field @xmath5 which yields the following field equations @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 the conserved charges of the spacetime can be calculated through the use of the substraction method of brown and york @xcite .",
    "such a procedure causes the resulting physical quantities to depend on the choice of reference background . for asymptotically ads solutions ,",
    "the way that one can calculate these quantities and obtain finite values for them is through the use of the counterterm method inspired by ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in this paper",
    "we deal with the spacetimes with zero curvature boundary , @xmath23 , and therefore the counterterm for the stress energy tensor should be proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "we find the suitable counterterm which removes the divergences in the form @xmath25 in the absence of the dilaton field , @xmath26 , and eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) reduces to @xmath27 which is the counterterm of the asymptotically ads spaces .",
    "having the total finite action @xmath28 at hand , we can use the quasilocal definition to construct a divergence free stress - energy tensor @xcite .",
    "thus we write down the finite stress - energy tensor in @xmath0-dimensional einstein - dilaton gravity with three liouville - type dilaton potentials ( v1 ) in the following form @xmath29 . \\label{stres}\\ ] ] the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ stres ] ) are the variation of the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to @xmath30 , and the last two terms are the variation of the boundary counterterm ( [ cont ] ) with respect to @xmath31 . to compute the conserved charges of the spacetime",
