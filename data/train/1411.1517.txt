    "quantum systems can be correlated in ways that supersede classical descriptions .",
    "however , there are degrees of non - classicality for quantum correlations . for simplicity , we consider only bipartite correlations , with the two , spatially separated , parties being named alice and bob as usual .    at the weaker end of the spectrum are quantum systems whose states can not be expressed as a mixture of product - states of the constituents .",
    "these are called non - separable or entangled states .",
    "the product - states appearing in such a mixture comprise a local hidden state ( lhs ) model for any measurements undertaken by alice and bob .    at the strongest end of the spectrum",
    "are quantum systems whose measurement correlations can violate a bell inequality  @xcite , hence demonstrating ( modulo loopholes  @xcite ) the violation of local causality  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon  commonly known as bell - nonlocality  @xcite  is the only way for two spatially separated parties to verify the existence of entanglement if either of them , or their detectors , can not be trusted  @xcite .",
    "we say that a bipartite state is bell - local if and only if there is a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model for any measurements alice and bob perform . here",
    "the ` variables ' are not restricted to be quantum states , hence the distinction between non - separability and bell - nonlocality .    in between these types of non - classical correlations lies epr - steering .",
    "the name is inspired by the seminal paper of einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr )  @xcite , and the follow - up by schrdinger  @xcite , which coined the term `` steering '' for the phenomenon epr had noticed . although introduced eighty years ago , as this special issue celebrates , the notion of epr - steering was only formalized eight years ago , by one of us and co - workers  @xcite .",
    "this formalization was that epr - steering is the only way to verify the existence of entanglement if one of the parties  conventionally alice  @xcite  or her detectors , can not be trusted .",
    "we say that a bipartite state is epr - steerable if and only if it allows a demonstration of epr - steering .",
    "a state is not epr - steerable if and only if there exists a hybrid lhv  lhs model explaining the alice  bob correlations . since in this paper we are concerned with steering , when we refer to a lhs model we mean a lhs model for bob only ; it is implicit that alice can have a completely general lhv model .",
    "the above three notions of non - locality for quantum states coincide for pure states : any non - product pure state is non - separable , eps - steerable , and bell - nonlocal .",
    "however for mixed states , the interplay of quantum and classical correlations produces a far richer structure . for mixed states",
    "the logical hierarchy of the three concepts leads to a hierarchy for the bipartite states : the set of separable states is a strict subset of the set of non - epr - steerable states , which is a strict subset of the set of bell - local states  @xcite .",
    "although the epr - steerable set has been completely determined for certain classes of highly symmetric states ( at least for the case where alice and bob perform projective measurements )  @xcite , until now very little was known about what types of states are steerable even for the simplest case of two qubits . in this simplest case , the phenomenon of steering in a more general sense",
    " i.e. within what set can alice steer bob s state by measurements on her system  has been studied extensively using the so - called steering ellipsoid formalism @xcite .",
    "however , no relation between the steering ellipsoid and epr - steerability has been determined .    in this manuscript",
    ", we investigate epr - steerability of the class of two - qubit states whose reduced states are maximally mixed , the so - called t - states  @xcite .",
    "we use the steering ellipsoid formalism to develop a deterministic lhs model for projective measurements on these states and we conjecture that this model is optimal .",
    "furthermore we obtain two sufficient conditions for t - states to be epr - steerable , via suitable epr - steering inequalities  @xcite ( including a new asymmetric steering inequality for the spin covariance matrix ) .",
    "these sufficient conditions touch the necessary condition in some regions of the space of t - states , and everywhere else the gap between them is quite small .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss in detail the three notions of non - locality , namely bell - nonlocality , epr - steerability and non - separability .",
    "section 3 introduces the quantum steering ellipsoid formalism for a two - qubit state , and in section 4 we use the steering ellipsoid to develop a deterministic lhs model for projective measurements on t - states . in section 5 ,",
    "two asymmetric steering inequalities for arbitrary two - qubit states are derived .",
    "finally in section 6 we conclude and discuss further work .",
    "two separated observers , alice and bob , can use a shared quantum state to generate statistical correlations between local measurement outcomes .",
    "each observer carries out a local measurement , labelled by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , to obtain corresponding outcomes labelled by @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the measurement correlations are described by some set of joint probability distributions , @xmath5 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 ranging over the available measurements .",
    "the type of state shared by alice and bob may be classified via the properties of these joint distributions , for all possible measurement settings @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the correlations of a _ bell - local _ state have a local hidden variable ( lhv ) model @xcite , @xmath6 for some ` hidden ' random variable @xmath7 with probability distribution @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the measured correlations may be understood as arising from ignorance of the value of @xmath7 , where the latter locally determines the statistics of the outcomes @xmath3 and @xmath4 and is independent of the choice of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "conversely , a state is defined to be bell_-nonlocal _ if it has no lhv model .",
    "such states allow , for example , the secure generation of a cryptographic key between alice and bob without trust in their devices  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we are concerned with whether the state is _ steerable _ ; that is , whether it allows for correlations that demonstrate epr - steering .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , epr - steering by alice is demonstrated if it is _ not _ the case that the correlations can be described by a hybrid lhv  lhs model , wherein , @xmath9 where the local distributions @xmath10 correspond to measurements on local quantum states @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 denotes the positive operator valued measure ( povm ) corresponding to measurement @xmath2 .",
    "the state is said to be _",
    "steerable _ by alice if there is _ no _ such model .",
    "the roles of alice and bob may also be reversed in the above , to define steerability by bob .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ lhv ] ) and ( [ lhs ] ) , it is seen that all nonsteerable states are bell - local .",
    "hence , all bell - nonlocal states are steerable , by both alice and bob .",
    "in fact , the class of steerable states is strictly larger @xcite .",
    "moreover , while not as powerful as bell - nonlocality in general , steerability is more robust to detection inefficiencies @xcite , and also enables the use of untrusted devices in quantum key distribution , albeit only on one side @xcite . by a similar argument ,",
    "a separable quantum state shared by alice and bob , @xmath14 , is both bell - local and nonsteerable .",
    "moreover , the set of separable states is strictly smaller than the set of nonsteerable states  @xcite .",
    "it is important that epr - steerability of a quantum state not be confused with merely the dependence of the reduced state of one observer on the choice of measurement made by another , which can occur even for separable states .",
    "the term ` steering ' has been used with reference to this phenomenon , in particular for the concept of ` steering ellipsoid ' , which we will use in our analysis .",
    "epr - steering , as defined above , is a special case of this phenomenon , and is only possible for a subset of nonseparable states .",
    "we are interested in the epr - steerability of states for all possible _ projective _ measurements . if alice is doing the steering , then it is sufficient for bob s measurements to comprise some tomographically complete set of projectors . it is straightforward to show in this case that the condition for bob to have an lhs model , eq .",

    "note that this form , and hence epr - steerability by alice , is invariant under local unitary transformations on bob s components .",
    "determining epr - steerability in this case , where alice is permitted to measure any hermitian observable , is surprisingly difficult , with the answer only known for certain special cases such as werner states @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we give a strong necessary condition for the epr - steerability of a large class of two - qubit states , which we conjecture is also sufficient .",
    "this condition is obtained via the construction of a suitable lhs model , which is in turn motivated by properties of the ` quantum steering ellipsoid '  @xcite .",
    "properties of this ellipsoid are therefore reviewed in the following section .",
    "an arbitrary two - qubit state may be written in the standard form @xmath22 here @xmath23 denote the pauli spin operators , and @xmath24,~ b_j=\\operatorname{tr}[\\rho\\ ,   \\i\\otimes\\sigma_j],~t_{jk}=\\operatorname{tr}[\\rho \\,\\sigma_j\\otimes\\sigma_k ] .\\ ] ] thus , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the bloch vectors for alice and bob s qubits , and @xmath27 is the spin correlation matrix .    if alice makes a projective measurement on her qubit , and obtains an outcome corresponding to projector @xmath16 , bob s reduced state follows from eq .",

    "we will refer to the vector @xmath36 rather than its corresponding operator @xmath16 .",
    "the surface of the steering ellipsoid is defined to be the set of steered bloch vectors , @xmath37 , and in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that interior points can be obtained from positive operator - valued measurements ( povms ) .",
    "the ellipsoid has centre @xmath38 and the semiaxes @xmath39 are the roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath40 the eigenvectors of @xmath41 give the orientation of the ellipsoid around its centre @xcite .",
    "thus , the general equation of the steering ellipsoid surface is @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the displacement vector from the centre @xmath44 .",
    "entangled states typically have large steering ellipsoids  the largest possible being the bloch ball , which is generated by every pure entangled state @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the volume of the steering ellipsoid is strictly bounded for separable states . indeed",
    ", a two - qubit state is separable if and only if its steering ellipsoid is contained within a tetrahedron contained within the bloch sphere @xcite .",
    "thus , the separability of two - qubit states has a beautiful geometric characterisation in terms of the quantum steering ellipsoid .",
    "no similar characterisation has been found for epr - steerability , to date .",
    "however , for non - separable states , knowledge of the steering ellipsoid matrix @xmath41 , its centre @xmath45 , and bob s bloch vector @xmath46 uniquely determines the shared state @xmath47 up to a local unitary transformation on alice s system @xcite , @xcite and so is sufficient , in principle , to determine the epr - steerability of @xmath47 . in this paper",
    "we find a direct connection between epr - steerability and the quantum steering ellipsoid , for the case that the bloch vectors @xmath48 and @xmath46 vanish .",
    "let @xmath49 be a singular value decomposition of the spin correlation matrix @xmath27 , for some diagonal matrix @xmath50 and orthogonal matrices @xmath51 . noting that any @xmath52 is either a rotation or the product of a rotation with the parity matrix @xmath53",
    ", it follows that @xmath27 can always be represented in the form @xmath54 , for proper rotations @xmath55 , where the diagonal matrix @xmath56 may now have negative entries .",
    "the rotations @xmath57 and @xmath58 may be implemented by local unitary operations on the shared state @xmath47 , amounting to a local basis change .",

    "it follows that if the shared state @xmath47 has maximally - mixed reduced states with @xmath60 , then it is completely described , up to local unitaries , by a diagonal @xmath27 , i.e. one may consider @xmath61 without loss of generality .",

    "they are equivalent to mixtures of bell states , and hence form a tetrahedron in the space parameterised by @xmath62 @xcite . entangled t - states necessarily have @xmath63 , and the set of separable t - states forms an octahedron within the tetrahedron @xcite .",
    "the t - state steering ellipsoid is centred at the origin , @xmath64 , and the ellipsoid matrix is simply @xmath65 , as follows from eqs .",

    "thus , the unit bloch vector @xmath80 labels both the local hidden state and the hidden variable .    given lhs models for bob for any two t - states , having spin correlation matrices @xmath81 and @xmath82 , it is trivial to construct an lhs model for the t - state corresponding to @xmath83 , for any @xmath84 , via the convexity property of nonsteerable states @xcite .",
