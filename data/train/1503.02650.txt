    "discovered in 1804 , juno was the third main - belt asteroid identified , following ceres and pallas . the first reasonably accurate measurement of juno s diameter was performed with filar micrometers on the great lick refractor @xcite and the yerkes 40-inch refractor @xcite , yielding a value of @xmath3  km ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "a modern measurement of its physical cross section came from 15-station stellar occultation data , yielding a mean diameter of 267@xmath15  km with a significant ellipticity @xcite .",
    "optical speckle interferometry soon produced a size measurement consistent with the occultation result @xcite .",
    "like most asteroids , juno s light curve is double - peaked with two maxima and two minima ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicative of a non - spherical shape .",
    "based on light curve inversion , juno has a unique rotational pole that is significantly tilted with respect to the ecliptic @xcite , and its period of 7.209531  hr is known to high accuracy @xcite .",
    "this information , combined with recent , near - infrared adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging led to a triaxial ellipsoid model with axis lengths of 297 , 233 , and 222  km @xcite .",
    "a three - dimensional model with 2036 faces and 1020 vertices based on a combination of the historical optical light curves and two occultations @xcite is hosted by the database of asteroid models from inversion techniques ( damit ; * ? ? ?",
    "juno is a member of the s - class of asteroids @xcite , which have a stony composition of iron - bearing silicates and metallic iron as inferred primarily from their 1  @xmath4 m spectral absorption feature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the optical small main - belt asteroid spectroscopic survey ( smassii ) assigns it subclass sk as a transition object toward the k - class , which exhibits a shallower 1  @xmath4 m feature @xcite . _",
    "infrared space observatory _ spectra of juno show an 8 - 11.5  @xmath4 m feature that is consistent with the laboratory measurements of the silicate minerals pyroxine and olivine @xcite .",
    "evidence for surface features on juno have been suggested by the variation as a function of rotation angle of its optical colors @xcite and linear polarization @xcite , and by a sequence of optical ao images , which suggested a large impact crater @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , there are no published images of juno from the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "@xcite , and there have been no spacecraft encounters as yet .    as a powerful new tool in the study of solar system bodies , the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ;",
    "* ) will be able to map the shape and surface temperature distributions of hundreds of main belt asteroids and jupiter trojans @xcite .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "first , the absorption length of ( sub)millimeter photons @xcite on asteroid surfaces is comparable to the thermal skin depth of the diurnal wave ( typically a few to 10 wavelengths ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; thus , these wavelengths are well - matched to probe the thermal response of this material and should provide information on the thickness , structure and nature of the regolith @xcite .",
    "indeed , the recent flybys of the main belt asteroids 21  lutetia and 2867  teins by the _ rosetta _ mission have yielded important measurements of the thermal inertia and emissivity of their surface material (   [ discuss ] ) using its ( sub)millimeter radiometers @xcite .",
    "second , alma has exquisite continuum brightness temperature sensitivity at small angular scales .",
    "for example , the 50-antenna , full - bandwidth sensitivity in one minute at 300  ghz ( 1  mm ) at the highest angular resolution ( 13 mas ) is 10  k. since their physical temperatures are typically 100 - 200  k , alma can effectively image these bodies down to linear resolutions of 10  km ( at a distance @xmath5  au ) with high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , enabling the use of the powerful tool of self - calibration . as a significant step toward demonstrating this capability , in this letter we present the first millimeter wavelength images to resolve the surface of juno , which were obtained during the recent campaign to commission alma s long baseline capabilities @xcite .",
    "the availability of the damit model provides an excellent test of alma s imaging performance , while the resulting images provide new details on the surface conditions of juno .",
    "an approximately 53-minute length scheduling block ( sb ) to observe the 1.3  mm ( 233  ghz ) continuum emission from juno was executed five consecutive times on 2014 oct 19 starting at 09:15 ut ( 43  min before local sunrise ) and ending at 13:38  ut .",
    "four spectral windows were used , each with 2  ghz bandwidth , 128 channels and dual polarization .",
    "center frequencies were 224 , 226 , 240 , and 242  ghz .",
    "all necessary calibration observations were performed in each execution of the sb .",
    "an additional focus measurement and adjustment was performed prior to the fifth execution ( two hours after sunrise ) as per normal operations .",
    "the sb included an external ephemeris with 4  min sampling obtained from jet propulsion lab ( jpl ) horizons , which reports a @xmath6 uncertainty of 60  mas in right ascension and 26  mas in declination .",
    "calibration and imaging was performed in casa version 4.2.2 .",
    "the complex gain calibration cycle time was 68  s , with juno being observed for 48  s and the gain calibrator ( j0757 + 0956 ) for 15  s ( 5.7 away ) .",
    "data from 27 to 31  antennas were used , ranging in projected baseline length from 0.02 to 10  m@xmath7 ( 26  m to 13  km ) .",
    "the zenith precipitable water vapor varied from 1.4 to 1.6  mm .",
    "bandpass and flux calibration is based on observations of the quasar j0750 + 1231 in each sb .",
    "this quasar is an alma calibration grid source @xcite for which a linear interpolation in frequency from the measurements nearest in time at 3  mm ( 7 days ) and 0.87  mm ( 18 days ) yields an assumed flux density of 0.64@xmath10.04  jy at 233  ghz with a spectral index of @xmath8 .",
    "the calibrator flux density measurements were stable over many weeks and we estimate our flux scale to be accurate to 6% . the mean flux density derived for the gain calibrator was quite consistent across the five executions , differing by a maximum of 2.4% from the weighted mean of all executions ( @xmath9  jy ) .",
    "thus , there was very little decorrelation on timescales shorter than the integration time ( 1.92  s ) .",
    "as shown in table  [ table ] , the span of observations was approximately centered on the time of transit of juno .",
    "following calibration , the uv data from each execution was split into two halves , with the duration and time on source of each half being @xmath1018  min and @xmath1010  min , respectively .",
    "the ten resulting datasets ( epochs ) were imaged individually using a robust weighting parameter of zero .",
    "phase - only self - calibration was then performed , initially with a time interval of 300  s , followed by a refinement with a time interval of 15  s. the final execution showed phase - cal solutions of somewhat larger magnitude and higher variability than the rest , with a loss of some antennas on the outermost pads . amplitude self - calibration on a timescale of 300  s was then performed .",
    "the final images were constructed using multi - scale clean @xcite with deconvolution scales of 0 , 5 , and 15 pixels to avoid image artifacts caused by the clean instability that can occur when modeling an extended source using only delta functions .",
    "the image dynamic range after self - calibration was 120 .",
    "this improvement factor of 2 - 6 indicates that a significant residual phase error was present after normal calibration .",
    "thus , it is important to realize that any usage of calibrated visibilities for direct modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) must either apply the imaging self - calibration solutions or include antenna - based phase solutions as a model parameter to be solved @xcite .",
    "as expected when the initial self - calibration model has high s / n , the intensity - weighted centroid of the source before and after self - calibration is consistent to within a fraction of the ( 5  mas ) pixel size ( @xmath11 in most images , and @xmath12 in the final two images ) . because we used an accurate vlbi position for the gain calibrator ( 07:57:06.64296 , + 09:56:34.8525 ;",
    "* ) , we expect our images to follow alma s measured astrometric performance ( 3  mas ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  mas for these observations of juno according to the formulas of @xcite . ] .",
    "the images vary in the size of the synthesized beam from @xmath13  mas to @xmath14  mas , with a mean position angle of @xmath15 .",
    "these images are publicly available from the alma science verification page ] . to present matched resolution images",
    ", we smoothed the images with a two dimensional elliptical gaussian to obtain a circular beam of 42.0  mas , which at the earth - juno distance of @xmath16  au corresponds to 60  km .",
    "no near - field correction was applied to the uv data , but juno was beyond the fraunhofer distance for the longest baseline , and the self - calibration process may mitigate the residual effects .",
    "juno s orbit has a mean radius of 2.67  au with significant eccentricity ( 0.25 ) and inclination ( 13 ) . as shown in figure  [ orbitdiagram ] , the true anomaly was @xmath17 during our observations , with a solar phase angle of -28 yielding an illumination percentage of 94% .",
    "we have plotted the orientation of the rotational pole inferred from parametric blind deconvolution of near - infrared ao images ( ecliptic longitude @xmath18 and latitude @xmath19 ) which has an uncertainty of 13 @xcite .",
    "the direction of juno was @xmath20 , thus our viewing angle was 48 from the polar axis but nearly coplanar , with the southern hemisphere dominating the view , as shown in the inset of figure  [ orbitdiagram ] .",
    "the angular smearing due to the 15 of axial rotation during each 18  min image leads to 21  mas of linear smearing at the mean radius , which is half the beam size , leading to @xmath21% loss in resolution .",
    "the mean epochs of the images are listed in table  [ table ] , along with the corresponding rotational phases computed with respect to the zero time point of the @xcite triaxial model , and with respect to the optical ao observations of @xcite .",

    "the absolute position was measured in each image by computing the centroid of all pixels above the @xmath23 level , where @xmath24 , the image rms , was defined by an annulus surrounding the object ( see table  [ tabletwo ] notes ) .",
    "these pixels were weighted uniformly to avoid influence of surface brightness variations across the face of the object .",
    "the difference between the centroid position and the image phase center yields the observed offset from the jpl ephemeris , which is stable in right ascension at @xmath25  mas , but slowly varying in declination .",
    "the integrated flux density of the source was measured by integrating over all pixels above the @xmath6 level .",
    "the peak positions , intensities , and the corresponding planck brightness temperatures ( @xmath26 ) are also listed in table  [ tabletwo ] .",
    "note that these @xmath26 differ from the rayleigh - jeans approximation by @xmath27  k. an estimate of the median brightness temperature across the surface was computed for each image by finding the median pixel intensity in the clean component model image and dividing by the solid angle of a pixel .",
    "the result is typically 10 - 15  k below the peak @xmath26 .      in order to obtain a size measurement independent of the existing shape models , we consider the underlying source to be an elliptical disk with uniform brightness .",
    "first , we first fit the observed image from each epoch with a two - dimensional elliptical gaussian , recording the position angle and major and minor axes as the target parameters .",
    "we then create a disk model image using the target parameters , but with the major and minor axes increased by 30% to account for the bulk of the size underestimate resulting from the gaussian brightness profile .",
    "we then convolve this disk model image with a 42  mas beam to match the observations .",
    "next we iteratively refined the disk model parameters until an elliptical gaussian fit to the convolved disk model image matched the target parameters .",
    "the resulting uniform brightness elliptical disk model parameters for each epoch are listed in table  [ tabletwo ] .",
    "the geometric mean of the median of the major and minor axes of the ten elliptical disk models ( @xmath28 ) corresponds to @xmath29  km .",
    "this mean diameter is consistent with the size derived from 250  ghz single dish flux density measurements under the assumption of unity emissivity ( @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the mean diameter is also in reasonable agreement with the triaxial geometric mean ( @xmath32  km ) of the three axes of the @xcite triaxial ellipsoid model , the equivalent diameter of the @xcite model ( @xmath33  km ) , and the effective diameter measured by radar ( @xmath34  km ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ iras _ minor planet survey ( imps ) inferred a radiometric mean diameter of @xmath35  km , but imps diameters are systematically low compared to occultation diameters @xcite .",
    "we note that our assumption of uniform brightness is somewhat unphysical , as the daytime surface temperature will vary as a function of local hour and latitude in more realistic thermal models @xcite .",
    "we estimate that our method will yield sizes that are @xmath362 - 4% smaller than the mean physical size .",
    "thus , further detailed comparisons of the millimeter images to any specific shape model should be performed in the context of a thermal model .",
    "the model images shown in figure  [ juno_shifted ] were obtained using the damit online tool ( see also the interactive service for asteroid models ( isam ) ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this tool provides a prediction of the projected appearance of the asteroid on the sky as viewed from earth in equatorial coordinate orientation at any observed julian date .",
    "the light travel time effect is taken into account ( in this case 16.4  minutes ) .",
    "the damit prediction for the eso 1.5  m speckle observation of @xcite is in excellent agreement with the shape of the observed image , obtained over 34 years ago .",
    "likewise , the shape of the damit prediction is in good agreement with most of the alma images .",
    "the images we show here use artificial lighting in order to show the full geometrical extent of the body , which will emit millimeter emission that is only mildly modulated by solar illumination . in a qualitative sense , it is perhaps images 4 and 5 that are most discrepant from the model in terms of ellipticity and orientation .",
    "as for angular scale , the quoted accuracy of the damit images is @xmath37% .",
    "the alma - derived major axes ( table  [ tabletwo ] ) are systematically @xmath38% smaller than the maximum extent in the damit images , however much of this difference could be due to the simplistic model used in ",
    "[ size ] .      to accentuate the variation of brightness across the object , we have created a model image of uniform brightness corresponding to each of the ten images .",
    "we begin with the clean component model image , and compute the median value within the central 0.15 diameter (   [ images ] ) .",
    "we then place this value into all pixels of the clean model that are inside the 40% level in the clean image , and place zero elsewhere .",
    "this approach leads to a model image comparable to the angular dimensions of juno .",
    "we then convolve this model with the 42  mas beam and subtract it from the clean image .",
    "this subtraction enables the identification of areas of lower vs. higher brightness temperature , regardless of the relative calibration accuracy between the different images .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ juno_diff ] . in most of the frames there",
    "is a consistent pattern of the northwest edge being the coolest portion , which matches the location of the evening terminator .",
    "also , the warmest part of the image appears correlated with the subsolar point .",
    "in the first five images , the afternoon area following the subsolar point is the warmest point .",
    "meanwhile , in the last four images , the warmest point is at ( or very close to ) the subsolar point .",
    "the temperature contrast becomes particularly pronounced in the final two images as the surface median @xmath26 declines ( table  [ tabletwo ] ) .",
    "in the simple equilibrium model , the expected disk - averaged brightness temperature , @xmath39 , of an asteroid is determined by its spectral emissivity , @xmath40 , and its mean equilibrium temperature , @xmath41 : @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is its bolometric bond albedo , @xmath45 is its heliocentric distance in au , and @xmath46  k for non - rotating objects and 277  k for fast - rotating objects @xcite .",
    "the bolometric bond albedo is a product of the bolometric geometric albedo ( @xmath47 ) and the bolometric phase integral ( @xmath48 ) . in principle , both of these components represent integrals of wavelength - dependent quantities which must be measured and weighted by the solar flux spectrum @xcite , but they are often approximated as being wavelength independent .",
    "measurements of @xmath47 for juno at optical wavelengths ( @xmath49 ) range from @xmath50 @xcite to 0.15 @xcite , while a value of @xmath51 has been found at mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the observed variation in optical brightness versus phase angle yields a slope parameter @xmath52 @xcite , which in turn yields @xmath53 from the relation of @xcite . combining @xmath54 with the more recent measurements of @xmath55",
    ", we will proceed with @xmath56 , which matches the result others have obtained by using the @xmath49 values along with @xmath57 appropriate for the moon . in any case , the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath44 is quite mild . assuming @xmath30 , the equilibrium model prediction for @xmath58 for our juno observations ( @xmath59  au ) is then 188  k to 223  k , depending on @xmath60 .",
    "juno is a fast rotator , but its polar axis was pointed significantly in line with the sun during the alma observations ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , an @xmath60 value in the lower half of the range is likely to be appropriate , which is consistent with our measured median @xmath61(233  ghz ) of @xmath2  k. a previous single - dish estimate of @xmath62(345  ghz ) was @xmath63  k at @xmath64  au @xcite , which scales to @xmath65  k at our smaller value of @xmath45 .    moving beyond the equilibrium model ,",
    "we next consider the standard thermal model for asteroids ( stm ; * ? ? ?",
    "because alma resolves the surface of juno , we can compare the observed peak brightness temperature with the expected subsolar surface temperature ( @xmath66 ) in the stm .",
    "for juno s values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and its beaming factor of @xmath67 @xcite , the expected @xmath66 is 286  k. this value is significantly higher than the peak @xmath26 of @xmath68  k observed by alma , in contrast to previous mid - infrared measurements of @xmath66 on juno which are consistent with the stm prediction @xcite .",
    "if interpreted in the context of a model where all of the emission arises from the surface , such a discrepancy could be interpreted as an `` effective '' @xmath69 at 1.3  mm .",
    "effective emissivity is a quantity which can encompass many effects besides the physical emissivity of the material , including sub - surface sounding of deeper colder layers @xcite .",
    "indeed , in terms of a physical model with temperature gradients in the sub - surface material of up to 50  k  mm@xmath70 , such a large temperature discrepancy is expected to be seen in millimeter wavelength emission , which arises from material at a range of depths , even when the bulk material has @xmath71 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to interpret the enhanced brightness temperature of the subsolar point in most of the juno images , we consider heat conduction in the regolith following the equations in @xcite",
    "the thermal inertia ( @xmath72 ) is a function of the surface material density ( @xmath73 ) , thermal conductivity ( @xmath74 ) , and specific heat capacity ( @xmath75 ) of the soil , while the thermal skin depth ( @xmath76 ) also depends on the angular rotation rate ( @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 @xmath79 using the surface density of vesta derived from its radar albedo ( 1.75  g  @xmath80 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along with values for @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the porous lunar surface layer ( @xmath81 w  cm@xmath70  k@xmath70 and 0.6  j  g@xmath70  k@xmath70 , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yields @xmath83  j  m@xmath84  s@xmath85  k@xmath70 and @xmath86  mm . since @xmath76 is only 2.2 wavelengths , we can expect the observed continuum emission to arise from a mix of solar - heated surface material and deeper unheated material .",
    "thus , the correlation of juno s brightness temperature with the subsolar point is not surprising .",
    "however , the fact that the brightest point moves from the subsolar afternoon area in the first half of the images to near coincidence with the subsolar point in the latter half of the images , suggests a change in the soil properties with longitude .",
    "for example , in the case that @xmath74 is constant with depth and longitude , @xmath76 would scale inversely with @xmath72 due to changes in either @xmath73 or @xmath75 .",
    "thus , if soil with relatively lower values of @xmath73 or @xmath75 exists at these longitudes ( @xmath87 ) , it could have a lower thermal inertia , deeper skin depth , and consequently a greater proportion of the millimeter emission arising from heated material .",
    "a lower inertia across most of this side of juno might also explain the lower median @xmath26 observed , as cooling would proceed more rapidly as the angle from the subsolar point increases . in any case ,",
    "variations in thermal inertia across the surface of an asteroid are quite plausible , particularly in light of the detailed variations on vesta reported from the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer on the _ dawn _ spacecraft @xcite .",
    "recently , two asteroids have been measured at 0.53 and 1.6  mm by the microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ( miro ) during close encounters by the european space agency _ rosetta _ spacecraft : the small ( @xmath106  km ) object teins @xcite , and the larger ( @xmath10100  km ) object lutetia @xcite .",
    "in contrast to teins , which has a high , rock - like inertia ( @xmath88  j  m@xmath84  s@xmath85  k@xmath70 ) and @xmath89 , lutetia exhibits a very low thermal inertia ( @xmath90  j  m@xmath84  s@xmath85  k@xmath70 ) in the upper 1 - 3  cm much like the fine dust of the lunar regolith , with an emissivity consistent with reflection from a surface with dielectric constant of 2.3 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "these latter properties may be similar to what alma has seen on juno , particularly in the latter half of the images .",
    "this result is perhaps not surprising in the context of the subsequent thermophysical modeling of @xcite , which finds that low thermal inertias and @xmath92 can fit the infrared to centimeter spectral energy distributions of the asteroids ceres , vesta , pallas , and hygiea .",
    "the possibility of a recent impact on juno was raised by the detection of a region of reduced 934  nm brightness in ao images correlated with a spatial `` bite '' feature on the limb @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the north / south orientation of the @xcite images is not specified . however , judging from the damit model images at that epoch , the ao images would appear to be oriented with south up because in this case , a depression in the model images would map closely to the proposed crater near the limb of the fifth ao image .",
    "if so , then the crater is located near the north pole . as shown in figure  [ orbitdiagram ] ,",
    "the alma viewing angle of juno differs by 114 from the @xcite ao images such that the north pole is not visible . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ao image is oriented with north up , as it is in similarly - acquired images of vesta by a subset of these authors @xcite , then the crater would lie between the equator and the south pole , placing it at a latitude that crosses near the center of the alma view .",
    "the rotational phase of the fifth ao image ( @xmath93 ) is close to that of alma image 3 , thus a feature on the limb in the ao image would cross the sub - earth point in the alma image 114 + 90=204 later ( i.e. at @xmath94 ) .",
    "this phase corresponds to alma images 8 and 9 .",
    "those images do show the highest temperature contrast with respect to the subsolar point , which could be consistent with a lower thermal inertia in the excavated material surrounding the crater .",
    "clearly , future alma observations of complete rotations of juno , preferably at multiple phases and wavelengths , will be necessary to explore this phenomenon further and develop an accurate , full - surface thermophysical model .",
    "our alma long - baseline observations of juno provide the first ground - based images that significantly resolve the surface of an asteroid at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "they provide an independent set of size and shape measurements which confirm our current knowledge expressed by the damit and triaxial ellipsoid models .",
    "future alma observations of main belt asteroids , including both spatially - unresolved photometric lightcurves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and resolved images , can be used to test and refine the existing three - dimensional models .",
    "we note that alma can potentially achieve significantly higher physical resolution on juno that these initial observations offer .",
    "for example , a factor of three improvement ( to 20  km resolution ) would be possible by observing in the 345  ghz band with a similar antenna configuration at a future favorable opposition ( e.g. , 16 nov 2018 , @xmath95  au ) .",
    "these observations would match the resolution of miro s 1.6  mm channel during _",
    "rosetta s _ flyby of lutetia . at these scales ,",
    "measurements of the brightness temperature will provide new information about the surfaces of these bodies . to develop accurate thermophysical models",
    ", it will be important to observe them at multiple ( sub)millimeter wavelengths where a drop in emissivity to values of @xmath96 has been reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) particularly for rockier bodies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "alma can also potentially measure the mutual orbit of smaller binary asteroids , providing important information on the mass and density of such objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the ability of alma to deliver very accurate astrometry will enable better long - term modeling of asteroid orbits , leading to improved predictions @xcite .",
    "this paper makes use of the following alma data set : .",
    "alma is a partnership of eso ( representing its member states ) , nsf ( usa ) and nins ( japan ) , together with nrc ( canada ) , nsc and asiaa ( taiwan ) , and kasi ( republic of korea ) , in cooperation with the republic of chile .",
    "the joint alma observatory is operated by eso , aui / nrao and naoj .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",

    "<S> we present atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) 1.3  mm continuum images of the asteroid 3 juno obtained with an angular resolution of @xmath0 ( 60  km at 1.97  au ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained over a single 4.4  hr interval , which covers 60% of the 7.2  hr rotation period , approximately centered on local transit . </S>",
    "<S> a sequence of ten consecutive images reveals continuous changes in the asteroid s profile and apparent shape , in good agreement with the sky projection of the three - dimensional model of the database of asteroid models from inversion techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a geometric mean diameter of 259@xmath14  km , in good agreement with past estimates from a variety of techniques and wavelengths . due to the viewing angle and inclination of the rotational pole </S>",
    "<S> , the southern hemisphere dominates all of the images . </S>",
    "<S> the median peak brightness temperature is 215@xmath113  k , while the median over the whole surface is @xmath2  k. with the unprecedented resolution of alma , we find that the brightness temperature varies across the surface with higher values correlated to the subsolar point and afternoon areas , and lower values beyond the evening terminator . </S>",
    "<S> the dominance of the subsolar point is accentuated in the final four images , suggesting a reduction in the thermal inertia of the regolith at the corresponding longitudes , which are possibly correlated to the location of the putative large impact crater . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate alma s potential to resolve thermal emission from the surface of main belt asteroids , and to measure accurately their position , geometric shape , rotational period , and soil characteristics . </S>"
