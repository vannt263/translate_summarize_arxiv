    "the galactic interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) is very important in understanding the spectrum of the very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0 rays originated from the galactic sources . at the acceleration site",
    ", it is generally believed that the vhe cosmic ray electrons interact with isrf photons via inverse compton scattering and generates the vhe @xmath0 rays . from the propagation s point of view , on the way to the observer , the vhe @xmath0 ray could be absorbed due to its interaction with isrf and in turn changes its spectrum .    in previous studies the absorption of the vhe @xmath0 rays is focused on those from high redshift sources which interact with the extragalactic photon background .",
    "the absorption of the vhe @xmath0 rays within the galaxy is believed to be small since the @xmath0 rays travel a short distance . however , due to a most recent calculation by porter and strong @xcite , which has incorporated a large amount of relevant new astronomical information of stellar populations , galactic structure and interstellar dust , the density of the infra - red background within the galaxy is enhanced considerably compared with the previous models .",
    "especially there is a very high infra - red background near the galactic center due to this calculation .",
    "therefore , the attenuation of the vhe @xmath0 rays within the galaxy may become important if the @xmath0 rays come from the direction of the galactic center . in another work",
    "@xcite the mean free path ( mfp ) of cosmic ray nuclei is calculated again due to the new results of isrf .",
    "it is found that the mfp is greatly decreased if considering the infra - red background near the galactic center . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to estimate the absorption of vhe @xmath0 rays within the galaxy by the isrf .",
    "the isrf is composed of the star light , the infra - red radiation and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the energy density of star light is determined by the distribution and spectrum of each stellar type .",
    "the starlight is then absorbed by dust in the interstellar medium and re - emit in infra - red , of which the density depends on the distribution of the dust .",
    "the starlight is also scattered by the dust and forms the diffuse galactic light .",
    "the starlight dominates the isrf from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "the emission from the very small dust grain dominates from @xmath2 to @xmath3 while the emission from larger dust grain with temperature of about 20k dominates from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "the cmb contributes mainly to above @xmath6 .",
    "a detailed calculation of isrf has been established and adopted widely@xcite .",
    "taking into account the new results of the galactic stellar distribution , the dust distribution and other astronomical information of the galaxy , the calculation of the isrf spectra is recently updated@xcite .",
    "together with the very successful infrared surveys carried by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) and the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) on board the cosmic ray background explorer ( cobe ) satellite , our knowledge on the energy ( number ) density of isrf photons has been greatly improved .",
    "the new calculation of the local radiation field shows quite well agreement with these observations .    due to the isrf background",
    "the vhe @xmath0-rays is attenuated when penetrating the radiation background for it undergoes the @xmath7 pair production in colliding with the isrf .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum @xmath8 at the source is attenuated to @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the observed spectrum after the attenuation , @xmath11 represents the optical depth of the @xmath0-rays , being a function of the @xmath0-ray energy and the distance from the @xmath0-ray source .",
    "@xmath11 is given as @xmath12 where the integration of @xmath13 is along the line of sight of the incoming @xmath0-rays , @xmath14 is the number density of the isrf photons at the radius @xmath15 from the gc at energy @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the cross section of the pair production .",
    "the cross section is zero below the threshold when the center - of - mass energy @xmath18 . above the threshold",
    "the cross section is given by @xmath19\\ \\",
    ", \\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the thomson cross section for photon elastic scattering on a rest electron , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energy and the magnitude of momentum of the electron at the center - of - mass system . at the laboratory system",
    ", @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the angle between the momentum of the incoming @xmath0 ray and the isrf photon .",
    "for the isrf photon we have assumed an isotropic distribution when doing the integration over the @xmath25 .",
    "the attenuation of extragalactic @xmath0 rays due to colliding with the cmb from high redshift sources has been studied extensively .",
    "the attenuation length can fall below 10 kpc when the @xmath0 ray energy reaches about 500 tev . as the new calculation of isrf shows that the number density of far - infrared isrf ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) at the galactic center is almost comparable to that of cmb photons",
    ", we therefore expect a significant attenuation at the distance of 10 kpc within the galaxy for @xmath0 rays at the energy of about 50 tev .",
    "attenuation of the vhe @xmath0 rays due to interaction with the isrf as a function of the @xmath0 ray energy .",
    "contributions to the attenuation due to cmb and the isrf without cmb are plotted separately . ]",
    "as the isrf is most intense at the gc , the @xmath0 rays passing through the gc should experience the largest attenuation . among the limited number of tev @xmath0 ray sources that have been observed in the milky way ,",
    "sgr a * is the most suitable one for studying this absorption effect .",
    "sgr a * locates right at the gc , about 8 kpc away from the earth .",
    "though its integrated flux above 165 gev is only 5% of that of crab measured by hess @xcite , its energy spectrum is much harder , with a power law index at about 2.2 @xcite , which makes its integrated flux above 50 tev almost comparable to that of the crab and enables future high statistic observation .    to calculate the attenuation of the @xmath0 rays emitted from sgr a * , we need to know the radial distribution of the number densities of the isrf photons between the gc and the earth . as the number density of the isrf photons falls from the gc to the edge of the galaxy in the form of an exponential function with the radial scale length of about 4kpc @xcite",
    ", @xmath26 is therefore interpolated using the densities calculated by porter and strong@xcite for the in - plane at r=0 kpc , 4 kpc and 8 kpc . considering that the dust emission might have a different spatial dependence than the overall isrf spectrum",
    ", a linear interpolation has also been tried .",
    "actually there is no difference for the attenuation by exponential or linear interpolation .",
    "[ atten ] shows the calculated attenuation for the @xmath0 rays from sgr a * as a function of @xmath0 ray energy .",
    "the cutoff begins at about 20 tev and about 10% is abosorbed for @xmath0 rays at 50 tev and 20% for @xmath0 rays at 100 tev , which is not far from our expectation .",
    "the attenuation due to the cmb and the infra - red components is also plotted to compare their contributions . from fig .",
    "[ atten ] it seems that the effect of vhe @xmath0 ray attenuation should show itself if the observation reaches the energy scale of about 50 tev .",
    "using the recently calculated isrf distribution , and taking sgr a * as an example , this work shows that the isrf may have observable attenuation effect to the spectrum of vhe @xmath0 rays from the galactic sources .",
    "as the model might underestimate the isrf component between 20 to 40 @xmath27 compared with the observation by firas@xcite , the real effect could be even larger and start to appear at even lower energies . in turn , observation on the cutoff energy will provide independent information to test and constrain the isrf model .",
    "recent discovery on the new tev @xmath0 ray sources on galactic plane @xcite will provide us more candidates to study the distance dependent cutoff effect .    it should be mentioned that even the cutoff of the energy spectrum is observed the reason can be attributed either to an intrinsic cutoff , such as the cutoff spectrum of the injecting electron at the @xmath0 ray source , or to the isrf absorption discussed here .",
    "therefore a multi - band observation of the @xmath0 ray source and careful analysis are necessary to reveal the individual contribution as the intrinsic cutoff can be traced to lower energy band while absorption takes place only for the high energy band ."
