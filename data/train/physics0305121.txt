    "in the past years , a body of experimental data of stationary statistical distributions has been collected that are not well described by the usual boltzmann - gibbs distribution ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in many cases ,",
    "the concept of tsallis entropy @xcite together with the maximum entropy principle has been found useful to describe these data more accurately @xcite .",
    "the one - parametric family of tsallis entropies is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the so - called nonextensivity parameter .",
    "if a system consists of two statistically independent subsystems then tsallis entropy of this system is not equal to the sum of the tsallis entropies of the subsystems for @xmath2 .",
    "the additivity is recovered only in the limit @xmath3 , where tsallis entropy ( [ s_q ] ) reduces to the classical boltzmann - gibbs - shannon entropy @xmath4 , @xmath5 since tsallis entropy is postulated rather than derived , this point is open to discussion @xcite .",
    "very recently , two of the present authors have derived a unique trace ",

    "the maximum entropy principle under suitable constraints can be used to derive many relevant statistical distributions in physics but also in a wide range of other problems such as image reconstruction and time series analysis ( see e.g.  a.  r.  plastino in @xcite and references therein ) . using only conserved quantities as constraints ,",

    "both , eq .  ( [ pbeck ] ) and eq .  ( [ pgk ] ) reduce to @xmath32 . for @xmath33 , however , the distribution functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 in general show a different behavior .",
