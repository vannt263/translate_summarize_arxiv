    "it is remarkable that there are still no known exact solutions to einstein s equations describing a rotating stellar model with physically meaningful equation of state .",
    "such a model is necessary for accurately describing astrophysical objects such as stars , planets , galactic nuclei and galaxies , all of which are rotating in general .",
    "the closest to such an exact solution that has been found , is the rotating infinitely thin shell of dust matching to the extremal kerr solution , given by neugebauer and meinel  @xcite , and its generalisation to counter - rotating discs  @xcite .",
    "however , these models have no physically meaningful interior as the matter source has zero thickness .",
    "in particular , despite much effort , there is no global solution describing an interior rotating perfect fluid which matches smoothly to an exterior rotating vacuum solution .",
    "the slow rotation formalism , first developed by hartle in 1967  @xcite , has been important in deriving results about the possibility of matching an interior solution to an exterior vacuum .",
    "if such a matching is not possible in the slow rotation limit , then the matching will not be possible in general .",
    "for example , it was shown in  @xcite that the wahlquist metric can not be matched to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior .",
    "the general slow rotating vacuum exterior metric is known as the hartle - thorne metric , in general this metric is not asymptotically flat .",
    "it was later shown  @xcite that , up to second order in the angular velocity of the fluid , the wahlquist metric can be matched to the hartle - thorne exterior , if one drops the requirement of asymptotic flatness .",
    "in fact , with this requirement dropped , the matching of any slowly rotating perfect fluid to the hartle - thorne exterior is always possible up to second order in the fluids angular velocity  @xcite .",
    "it is now widely accepted that the universe is accelerating in expansion , which can be explained by the presence of a small positive cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the universe is not asymptotically flat , rather asymptotically it behaves like de sitter space .",
    "therefore , the possibility of matching an interior fluid solution to an asymptotically ( anti-)de sitter vacuum should be investigated and is somewhat more natural .",
    "for such an investigation to take place , suitable interior and exterior metrics satisfying einstein s equations with cosmological constant must be found .",
    "interior solutions can easily be constructed , any perfect fluid solution to einstein s equations with @xmath0 and a given equation of state @xmath1 is easily generalised to a solution to einstein s equations with @xmath2 by making the substitutions @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "this new solution now has the equation of state @xmath5 .",
    "this leaves us with the problem of finding a suitable vacuum exterior solution which is one of the motivations of this work . in this paper",
    "we work with the slow rotation formalism in the presence of a cosmological constant , and attempt to find the generalisation of the hartle - thorne exterior vacuum metric with @xmath6 , which we call the hartle - thorne-(anti)-de sitter metric .",
    "the hartle - thorne metric is asymptotically flat only when one of the constants in the metric is set to zero .",
    "however , the asymptotic behaviour of the hartle - thorne-(anti)-de sitter metric is considerably different , asymptotically it behaves like ( anti)-de sitter space for any values of the constants in the metric .",
    "investigating vacuum axisymmetric solutions with a cosmological constant is also important from a mathematical point of view . when @xmath0 there are an abundance of vacuum axisymmetric solutions , for example the weyl and papapetrou classes of solutions  @xcite .",
    "in the case of spherical symmetry , generalising a vacuum solution to a @xmath6-vacuum solution is simple , the schwarzschild metric is easily generalised to the schwarzschild - de - sitter metric .",
    "however , examples of stationary axially symmetric solutions to einstein s equations with a cosmological constant are very rare  @xcite .",
    "equations that were integrable with @xmath0 are no longer integrable for general @xmath2 .",
    "our hartle - thorne-(anti)-de sitter metric is an example of a new approximate axisymmetric @xmath6-vacuum solution .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : fe ] we begin by stating our conventions and deriving the slowly rotating @xmath6-vacuum field equations up to second order . in section  [ sec : slow ] we find the coordinate transformations required to transform the slowly rotating kerr - de - sitter metric into hartle s coordinates and derive the hartle - thorne-(anti)-de sitter metric .",
    "section  [ sec : prop ] discusses the properties of this solution and its asymptotic behaviour .",
    "section  [ sec : wahl ] reviews the wahlquist metric in the slow rotation formalism , and in section  [ sec : match ] we show that the wahlquist metric can be matched to an asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter metric up to second order in the rotation parameter .",
    "we conclude in the last section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the einstein field equations with cosmological term are given by @xmath7 where we set @xmath8 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fluid s 4-velocity , @xmath11 is its energy density and @xmath12 is its pressure .",

    "hartle then makes a slow rotation approximation by expanding this metric to order @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the angular velocity of the rotating fluid interior . in this paper",
    "we follow the notation of  @xcite and make the following expansion @xmath21+\\mathcal{o}(\\omega^3 ) ,    \\label{hartle}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is a function of order @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are of order @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "we will derive the vacuum field equations at successive orders in the rotation parameter @xmath20 .",
    "to zeroth order in @xmath20 we have the standard schwarzschild type metric @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "two independent vacuum field equations are given by @xmath32 - \\lambda & = 0,\\\\    \\frac{1}{r^2}[1-\\frac{b^2}{a^2}\\frac{d(ra^2)}{dr } ] + \\lambda & = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving these equations gives the well known schwarzschild-(anti)-de sitter spacetime @xmath33 for positive @xmath6 this spacetime has two horizons , the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon .",
    "their locations are given by the roots of the cubic equation @xmath34 , note that the third root is unphysical as @xmath35 .",
    "for @xmath36 , those horizon are located at @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for negative @xmath6 ,",
    "the metric has only one horizon , the black hole horizon .",
    "let us next consider the field equations up to order @xmath20 .",
    "in this case the metric takes the form @xmath39 there only is one extra field equation , namely @xmath40 ( we note @xmath41 ) , and it reads @xmath42 in the vacuum exterior , we know @xmath43 and , irrespective of their functional form , this equation is easily solved to give @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are constants of integration .",
    "the constant @xmath45 is first order in @xmath20 and @xmath47 can be identified with the total angular momentum of the spacetime . without loss of generality",
    "we are free to set @xmath48 by performing a rigid rotation of our coordinate system .",
    "using the full second order metric , we can derive 5 new equations for the functions @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 and the @xmath51 equations decouple , so can be treated separately .      from the @xmath52 independent part of @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "we can derive the following equations for @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 equation  ( [ m0 equation ] ) can immediately be solved to give @xmath58 and substituting this into  ( [ h0eqn ] ) allows us to solve for @xmath56 @xmath59 here @xmath60 is a constant of integration of order @xmath26 .      due to the nature of the problem ,",
    "the rest of this section is very equation heavy .",
    "we aim to give enough detail so that our calculations can be followed and verified .",
    "as expected , our equations reduce to those of  @xcite when @xmath6 is set to zero .    from the @xmath61 equation",

    "there are very few known exact rotating vacuum solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "a well known solution is the kerr - de - sitter metric , first discovered by carter in  @xcite .",
    "here we start by transforming the kerr - de - sitter metric into hartle s original coordinates .",
    "this enables us to find a particular solution to the equations given in the previous section .",
    "the kerr - de - sitter metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xmath74 expanding the metric  ( [ kerrbl ] ) to first order in @xmath45 we arrive at @xmath75    by looking at the @xmath76 component of this metric , we see that , unlike the kerr metric , the kerr - de - sitter metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates is asymptotically rotating . hence we first need to apply a coordinate transformation to adjust to an asymptotically non - rotating frame .",
    "this can be done by performing a rigid rotation of the coordinate system @xmath77 which gives @xmath78    next , we expand the kerr - de - sitter metric to second order in @xmath45 . to put this metric into hartle s form",

    "for convenience we now drop the hat and tildes . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the above coordinate transformation has not been given previously in the literature .",
    "in these new coordinates , we find the following expressions for hartle s functions @xmath86 these agree with the solutions for the slowly rotating kerr spacetime when @xmath87 .",
    "it is also easily checked that they satisfy hartle s equations derived in the previous section up to second order .",
    "we have found a particular solution to hartle s equations with cosmological constant .",
    "however , we are interested in finding further solutions . we have already found the general solution to the @xmath50 equations , so now we study the @xmath51 equations .",
    "we start with the following ansatz @xmath88 substitution of this into  ( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq2 ] ) yields a system of first order differential equations in @xmath89 and @xmath90 which is given by @xmath91 it turns out that in general we can not find an analytical solution to this system of equations . as stated above , when @xmath83 one can find analytical solutions to  ( [ inhom ] ) .",
    "curiously , when @xmath92 and @xmath2 one can also find solutions explicitly , however , these are more difficult to interpret in the context of the hartle formalism .",
    "we should note that we can always study solutions numerically .",
    "for given initial values @xmath93 and @xmath94 at some radius @xmath95 the equations can be integrated provided the right - hand sides remain regular .",
    "the singularity we may encounter when integrating numerically will correspond to the black hole event horizon and the cosmological horizon where the coordinates break down .",
    "in this section we will take a close look at the solutions of  ( [ inhom ] ) and in particular study their behaviour for large radii .",
    "firstly , equations  ( [ inhom ] ) are solved numerically for different parameter choices .",
    "secondly , we solve the differential equations by expanding in powers of @xmath96 and show that the numerical and analytical results match .      for given values of @xmath97 and @xmath6 and given initial conditions @xmath93 and @xmath94 at some radius @xmath95 , it is well know that a solution exists to the system of equations  ( [ inhom ] ) .",
    "this solution exists for all @xmath98 provided that the right - hand sides regular .",

    "this gives @xmath101 this @xmath102 is in fact quite natural as it is related to the discriminant of the metric of schwarzschild-(anti)-de sitter space .",
    "the other advantage of working with @xmath103 and @xmath102 is that both quantities are also dimensionless .    in order to avoid numerical issues at the cosmological horizon",

    "figure  [ fig : num1 ] shows the numerical solutions for some given initial conditions .",
    "we display log - log plots since these are convenient when comparing with the analytical results .",
    "which gives @xmath109 ; initial conditions are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",

    "the dashed lines in the right panel indicate the straight lines derived from the numerical solution for large @xmath103 .",

    "for the three chosen initial conditions we find @xmath118 and thus we can confidently conclude that the leading order term in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath89 should be @xmath119 while @xmath90 should approach a constant .",
    "varying the value of @xmath104 or the initial conditions does not change these results . for sake of simplicity",
    "we will not discuss the case of a positive cosmological term due to the numerical issues arising near the cosmological horizon . in principle",
    "this can be done by introducing coordinates regular at the horizon , however , this is outside the main focus of our work .      as already stated , we can not find the analytic solution to the @xmath51 equations .",
    "we will now examine the asymptotic behaviour of the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 for large @xmath120 and @xmath103 .",
    "this means we perform an expansion in powers of @xmath96 up to @xmath121 in the the system of equations  ( [ inhom ] ) or  ( [ inhom_n ] ) .",
    "we also expand @xmath89 and @xmath90 as power series in @xmath96 and @xmath119 and determine the coefficients of this expansion by solving  ( [ inhom ] ) and  ( [ inhom_n ] ) for each power separately .    for @xmath89",
    "we find @xmath122 or likewise using @xmath103 and @xmath102 @xmath123 we see that the leading order term in this expansion is @xmath96 or @xmath119 , in agreement with the numerical results .",
    "let us next consider @xmath90 for which we arrive at @xmath124 or equivalently in @xmath103 and @xmath102 @xmath125 here the leading order contribution is a constant , again in agreement with the numerical results .",
    "if we now compare  ( [ h2asymptote ] ) with  ( [ inhoma ] ) and  ( [ kerr1 ] ) , and  ( [ k2asymptote ] ) with  ( [ inhomb ] ) and  ( [ kerr5 ] ) , it follows that the kerr-(anti)-de sitter metric is the particular solution of this expansion with @xmath126 and @xmath48 .",
    "we further remark that this is the only solution with a terminating asymptotic expansion .",
    "it should be notes that the expansions  ( [ h2asymptote ] ) and  ( [ k2asymptote ] ) contain various @xmath127 terms .",
    "therefore , we can not consider the limit @xmath87 directly .",
    "this is not surprising since the since the presence of @xmath6 changes the characteristics of the differential equations considerably .    in order to study the @xmath0 case",
    ", one must set @xmath83 in  ( [ inhom ] ) and work directly with the resulting equations .",
    "these equations ( with @xmath83 ) can be solved analytically , see  ( [ br1 ] ) and  ( [ br2 ] ) . as expected , the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath83 solutions is quite different to the behaviour of the solutions with cosmological term . with @xmath6 ,",
    "in general we have @xmath128 and @xmath129 as @xmath130 . on the other hand , when @xmath83 , both functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 are proportional to @xmath131 as @xmath130 .",
    "coincidentally , the terms in the metric with @xmath6 are precisely of that same form @xmath132 . only if we choose @xmath126 does this solution become asymptotically flat . as expected from the presence of the cosmological constant we expect to find ( anti)-de sitter space asymptotically .",
    "the following subsection discusses this in more detail .      to investigate in more detail the behaviour of this metric at infinity we consider the canonical locally non - rotating lorentz tetrad considered in  @xcite which is given by @xmath133 in terms of this tetrad  @xcite , the gravitoelectric fields @xmath134 and the gravitomagnetic fields @xmath135 are defined in terms of the following components of the riemann tensor @xmath136 we see , using our asymptotic expansion for @xmath137 and @xmath138 , that both the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetc fields of the hartle - thorne-(anti)-de sitter metric tend to zero as @xmath139",
    "this happens for all values of the constants @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and hence we can conclude that the weyl tensor of the spacetime vanishes there .",
    "definitions of a spacetime being asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter are given in  @xcite , and we follow the notation given there .",
    "we can choose the conformal factor @xmath142 and also choose @xmath6 such that @xmath143 .",
    "since @xmath141 is of the order @xmath144 this will be true as long as @xmath6 is not really large and positive .",
    "this ensures that @xmath145 , so the square root is well defined .",
    "the function @xmath146 approaches the constant @xmath147 for large @xmath120 . loosely speaking requiring @xmath6 not to be too large ensure that the cosmological horizon is sufficiently far away from boundary of the slowly rotating fluid . in this case",
    "we can also be certain that our approximation remains valid within the fluid .",
    "next the conformally related metric is @xmath148 , and we define @xmath149 to be the boundary of our conformal metric at @xmath150 , which coincides with @xmath151 .",
    "now , @xmath152 is non - vanishing and smooth , and hence it is easily shown that , similar to the case of schwarzschild-(anti)-de sitter space , @xmath153 has the topology of @xmath154 at @xmath151 .",
    "moreover @xmath155 is non - vanishing on @xmath149 .",
    "we already showed that the weyl tensor identically vanishes on @xmath149 and hence one verifies that the hartle - thorne-(anti)-de sitter metric is always asymptotically ( anti)-de sitter .",
    "this is of course the expected result , but is in stark contrast to hartle - thorne metric without cosmological term as already mentioned before .",
    "in this section we review the wahlquist metric in the slow rotating limit .",
