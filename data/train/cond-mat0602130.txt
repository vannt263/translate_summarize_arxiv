    "_ stochastic resonance _ ( sr ) is one of the most interesting _ noise - induced phenomena _ , that arises from the interplay between _ deterministic _ and _ random _ dynamics in a _ nonlinear _ system @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been largely studied during more than two decades due to its great interest not only from a basic point of view but also for its technological interest and biological implications @xcite .",
    "most of those studies have used white or colored noises , with a few exceptions where more wide classes of noises were considered .",
    "for instance , in @xcite sr in systems subject to a colored and non gaussian noise was studied . however , there are other works more tightly related with the present one , as indicated by the following examples . in @xcite , the authors studied , through numerical simulations , the behavior of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) gain in a level crossing detector and a schmidt trigger , when subject to a colored noise composed of a periodic train pulse plus a gaussian @xmath0 noise with variable @xmath1 .",
    "their results indicate that the maximum of the snr is larger for white noise , and moves towards large noise intensities for increasing @xmath1 . in @xcite experimental evidence",
    "was found that noise can enhance the homeostatic function in the human blood pressure regulatory system .",
    "related with the last work , other experimental evidence was found in @xcite that an externally applied @xmath2 noise , added to the usual white noise , contributes to sensitizing the baroflex function in the human brain . in @xcite , and in a model of traffic junction of a main and a side road",
    ", it was found that the effect of a gaussian @xmath0 noise with @xmath3 shows an overall traffic efficiency enhancement .",
    "an enhancement of the sr phenomenon in a fitzhugh - nagumo model submitted to a colored noise with @xmath0 for @xmath4 was found in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was experimentally demonstrated that an sr - like effect can be obtained in rat sensory neurones with white , @xmath2 and @xmath5 noises , and that , under some particular conditions , @xmath2 noise can be better than white noise to enhance neuron s response .",
    "related to it , in @xcite it was shown that it is possible to enhance the sr effect in a fitzhugh - nagumo model submitted to a colored noise with @xmath0 , and that the optimal noise variance of sr could be minimized with @xmath6 .    motivated by the work of kaulakys and collaborators @xcite , who have introduced a method to generate @xmath2 noises over a wide range of frequencies ( see also @xcite ) , here we discuss how to extend such a procedure for positive and negative values of the stochastic variable .",
    "we also exploit this procedure to analyze the effect of a noise spectrum of the form @xmath0 with varying @xmath1 , on the sr phenomenon in a simple double - well potential . in the following section we present the model system to be studied and the procedure to generate the @xmath0 noise .",
    "afterwards we discuss an effective markovian approximation , and exploit it to study sr .",
    "finally we discuss the results and draw some general conclusions .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the following system of stochastic differential equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the coordinate of a particle diffusing in a double well potential @xmath9 subject to a noise @xmath10 .",
    "the second equation corresponds to the langevin equation driving the noise @xmath10 , inspired in the work of kaulakis et al .",
    "@xcite . in this last equation",
    "we consider a new potential @xmath11 , and a ( white ) noise @xmath12 that enters in a multiplicative form with a function @xmath13 .",
    "the last function will be characterized by an exponent @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the following form for the function @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 indicates the sign of @xmath18 ( i.e , @xmath19 if @xmath20 and @xmath21 if @xmath22 ) .",
    "for the function @xmath13 we adopt @xmath23 where both , the exponent @xmath14 and the constant @xmath24 are positive ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the above indicated forms change the symmetry of the potential @xmath26 and , in addition , when compared with the work in @xcite , increases the range of the noise variable from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , as is shown in fig .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 allows for the random variable @xmath18 to adopt negative values when @xmath29 .     as derived from eq .",

    "we have used the following values : @xmath30 and @xmath31.,width=415 ]      the most relevant aspect of the process @xmath18 is its power spectral density ( psd ) with a @xmath32 frequency behavior .",
    "kaulakis et al @xcite have shown that when @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the noise @xmath18 exhibits a @xmath32 functionality in a wide range of frequencies . for @xmath35 , but small , this property is still valid , as we show in figures [ fig_noise25 ] and [ fig_psd25 ] .    ) using @xmath14=5/2 and @xmath36 .",
    "the psd of this realization shows a @xmath32 behavior , see fig .",
    "[ fig_psd25].,width=415 ]    when the exponent @xmath14 changes , the psd behaves as @xmath37 , with @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "we will use this property to evaluate the mean - first - passage - time ( mfpt ) , and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",

    "using known expressions we obtain for the mfpt @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68    in order to study sr , as usual we introduce an external signal in the form of a term rocking the double well potential : @xmath69 , with @xmath70 ( in what follows we adopt @xmath71 ) . exploiting the so called  two - state approximation \" @xcite",

    ", we only show positive values of @xmath8.,width=415 ]    from the comparison of both figures it is apparent that the results obtained using the effective markovian theory are in very good ( qualitative ) agreement with those from simulations .",
    "this is in accord with previous results obtained for different systems @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that such kind of ucna - like approximation offers an adequate framework to obtain effective markovian approximations in a very wider class of systems than the one to which was originally applied @xcite .",
    "the above indicated results are in complete agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "that is : the maximum of the snr is larger for white noise , and it moves towards large noise intensities for increasing @xmath1 . in order to gain some physical insight about this behavior",
    "it is worth to remark that the function defined by eq .",
    "( [ pot_efectivo ] ) is directly related to an effective potential within the approximation we used @xmath79 the behavior of such a potential reveals what are the consequences of changing the exponent @xmath14 : when @xmath34 ( i.e. the psd is @xmath32 ) , the effective potential shows a well defined well ; but as @xmath14 decreases the well is less defined as shown in fig .",
    "such a behavior of the effective potential explains why the snr increases when @xmath14 decreases .",
    "the general theory shows that the snr increase is proportional to the kramers rate @xmath80 , that is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the high of the barrier in the effective potential separating the attractors .",
    "hence , the reduction of the snr with increasing @xmath1 ( or decreasing @xmath14 ) could be directly related with the marked reduction of the barrier separating the attractors in the effective potential picture .",
    "this also explains the reason for the shift of the snr maximum towards larger values of the noise intensity .    in conclusion , we want to remark that this is a first step towards an analytical understanding of two very important , connected , and ubiquitous , aspects in natural processes .",
    "those are : the @xmath37 behavior of noises psd , and its role in signal detection via the sr mechanism .",
    "the physical picture provided by the indicated effective markovian approximation , offers an adequate framework to analyze and understand the main qualitative trends of such phenomenon .",
    "even more , we expect to apply the same scheme to other noise induced phenomena when subject to @xmath37 noises",
