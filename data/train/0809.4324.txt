    "thus the study of triples is most often focused on primitive pythagorean triples ( ppts ) .",
    "this study has very ancient origins .",
    "an extensive list of ppts is found on a cuneiform tablet circa 1800 b.c.e .",
    "( see conway and guy * [ 3 ] * or robson * [ 10 ] * ) .",
    "van der waerden * [ 13 ] * speculates that much earlier knowledge is possible . though ancient , the field is wide open , judged by the number and depth of recent papers .",
    "we mention two central results : * a ) * a simple two - parameter generation process , and * b ) * an infinite ternary tree whose set of nodes is just the set of ppts .",
    "the generation by parameters is found in euclid and diophantus , but the ternary tree was overlooked until the second half of the twentieth century . it was first discovered in 1963 by f.j.m .",
    "barning * [ 1 ] * , and was then independently discovered by a. hall seven years later .",
    "a number of rediscoveries have occurred more recently .    in this article",
    ", we announce the discovery of an entirely different ternary tree . indirectly the new tree grew out of joint work which i and frank bernhart have been doing for several years ( see : * [ 2 ] * and * [ 8 ] * ) .",
    "an easy geometric argument , using figure 1 shows that the acute angle marked @xmath7 in the right triangle with legs @xmath8 is twice the size of the angle marked @xmath9 in the right triangle with legs @xmath10 , the unshaded triangle being isosceles .",
    "hence the tangent of the half - angle @xmath11 is just @xmath12 . by symmetry",
    ", there is another half - angle tangent ( or hat ) , namely @xmath13 .",
    "it follows that when the sides @xmath3 are rational ( or integral ) then the hats are rational , and can be reduced to lowest terms .",
    "these two reduced fractions @xmath14 are here displayed as the two columns of a @xmath15 matrix , with the numerators in the first row , and denominators in the second row .",
    "the reduced fraction with the largest denominator is put in the second column .",
    "these numbers will be revealed below to be the parameters that show up in the two variations of the ancient parametric solution .",

    "there is a single even number , and it is always in the first column .",
    "the column products are ( almost ) the legs of the right triangle .",
    "more precisely , the second column product equals the odd leg , whereas the first column product is _ half _ the even leg .",
    "the hypotenuse is the _ permanent _ ( the sum of the diagonal products ) .",
    "it is also the difference of the two row products :    @xmath19    less obviously , the two diagonal products and the two row products are the _ radii _ of four circles : the * _ in - circle _ * and the three * _ ex - circles _ * of the right triangle . the largest radius ( second row product ) is the sum of the other three .",
    "the product of all four numbers is the _ area _ of the triangle . in another article *",
    "[ 2 ] * we show that the four radii satisfy the descartes circle equation !    for triple @xmath20 $ ] above , the radii are found to be @xmath21 ( row products ) and @xmath22 ( diagonal products ) and the area is @xmath23 obviously , @xmath24 some of these claims are easy corollaries of others . however , the most basic fact about the boxes is this : the sum and difference of the first column numbers give the second column , that is : @xmath25 and @xmath26 these are the _ key _ equations .",
    "suppose that we convert the @xmath27 into a 4-tuple , @xmath28,$ ] by appending the second row to the reversal or flip of the first row .",
    "the key equations now say that this 4-tuple , @xmath29 , obeys the fibonacci rule .",
    "the sequence @xmath29 sits in the @xmath30 box like the letter `` c '' , counter - clockwise from the upper right ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "this example , or `` fibonacci box '' , is made up of four consecutive terms of the fibonacci sequence , and it generates the primitive triple @xmath31.$ ]    the fibonacci box ( * fb * ) is uniquely determined by any two numbers in it , hence the same is true of the triple .",
    "for example pick a column ( one of the hat fractions @xmath32 the ppt is then @xmath33 $ ] if we pick the first column , or @xmath34 if we pick the second column .",
    "these are the two standard solutions , known in essence for millennia .",
    "we also have a _ mixed _",
    "solution(s ) employing the column , row , and diagonal products that we gave earlier .",
    "@xmath35 = [ q'p ' , 2qp ,   pp ' - qq'].\\ ] ]    we think it is more elegant ( and informative ! ) , even though it uses all four parameters , when two are sufficient .",
    "* egyptian fractions and pythagorean triples *    one perhaps surprising application using all four parameters is to the writing of eqyptian fractions ( efs ) . consider the _ perimeter _ to _ area _ ratio given by @xmath36 the sum of the denominators ( radii ) on the right - hand side _ is _ the perimeter of the corresponding ppt .",
    "subtract @xmath37 from both sides to obtain a 3-term ef variant .",
    "now , subtract @xmath38 .",
    "the resultant 2-term ef , @xmath39 , gives the ratio of _ hypotenuse _ to _ area_. from the 4-term ef above , we also have @xmath40 which , together with its multiples , produces all of the 2-term solutions found in the rhind mathematical papyrus @xmath41 table .",
    "thus each * fb * produces both ppts and efs .    in the process of developing our work , bernhart and i used the key equations and the `` hat '' box for some time before we noticed the fibonacci property .",
    "this property is found also in horodam * [ 8 ] * , who cites dickson * [ 4 ] * for references to special cases noticed in the 19th century .",
    "horodam does not use the same expression(s ) for the hypotenuse as we do , and he has no reference to the hats .",
    "the reader may wish to fill in the details needed for all the claims made in the last section .",
    "we give some hints before turning to the matter of the trees .",
    "the two hats , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , satisfy @xmath44 this may be proved by substituting the values @xmath45 and @xmath46    since the sum of the half angles equals half of a right angle , we could also apply the tangent sum formula : @xmath47 and arrive at the same result .",
    "from there it is a small step to the following .",
    "@xmath48    the right - hand sides are both reduced , up to a factor of two for one case only .    a different perspective uses the complex number @xmath49 where the argument of @xmath50 is one of the half - angles , and",
    "@xmath51 is a hat fraction .",
    "then @xmath52 is a transformation that doubles the angle and squares the modulus , obtaining @xmath53 for the hypotenuse .",
    "numerous references to this approach exist .",
    "a similar technique is to find point @xmath54 on the unit circle @xmath55 in the coordinate plane using a line through @xmath56 or @xmath57 see silverman * [ 12 ] * , for example . in terms of projective / homogeneous coordinates ,",
    "`` points '' @xmath58 and @xmath59 determine a `` line '' of points @xmath60 choose finite @xmath61 in order to satisfy the pythagorean equation ( this intersects the unit circle at a new point ) .",
    "rescale to obtain @xmath62 which must be proportional to @xmath63    consider any * fb * that contains four positive integers and satisfies the key equations .",
    "define @xmath64 to be the products in the first and second rows , define @xmath65 to be the rising and descending diagonal products , with sum @xmath66 and let @xmath67 be the two column products",
    ". put @xmath68 the product of all four numbers is grouped in three ways to get @xmath69    quite easily @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 is equivalent to @xmath75 which we have just seen .",
    "so every * fb * gives a pythagorean triplet , not necessarily primitive .",
    "if some @xmath76 divides all four parameters of the box , divide each by @xmath77 clearly this removes a factor of @xmath78 from the triple .",
    "now suppose the second column contains an even parameter .",
    "combine key equations , obtain @xmath79 , and infer both numbers in the second column are even .",
    "divide the second column by two , and exchange the two columns .",
    "this will result in another * fb * , and remove a factor of two from the triple .",
    "when the second column is odd with no common factor @xmath80 we call the box _ primitive_. in this case the triple is primitive .",
    "when the first row ends in one , the box is clearly primitive .",
    "all triples of this sort form a family attributed to pythagoras , also described as the triples @xmath81 $ ] with @xmath82 .",
    "if the first row begins with one , and ends with any odd number , again the box is clearly primitive .",
    "this time the family of primitive triples is attributed to plato , also described as the triples @xmath81 $ ] with @xmath83    we can also get these families in a simple manner , the first by finding consecutive square numbers whose difference is an odd square , and the second by finding consecutive * _ odd _ * squares whose difference is an even square .",
    "both families are central to understanding the barning - hall tree * ( bh ) * _ and _ the new tree .",
    "consider the operation which takes the second row of a primitive box as the first row of a new box ; i.e. @xmath84 where @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86.$ ] then @xmath87 is also primitive . for instance @xmath88 \\to \\left [ { 3,2,5,7 } \\right ] \\to   \\\\    \\left [ { 7,5,12,17 } \\right ] \\to \\left [ { 17,12,29,41 } \\right]\\begin{array}{*{20}c }      \\to   &   \\ldots    \\\\ \\end{array}\\left [ { q_n , p_n , p_{n + 1 } , q_{n + 1 } } \\right ] \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\]]and we encounter the standard pell sequences @xmath89 ratios @xmath90 approach @xmath91 as a limit .",
    "the resulting triples satisfy @xmath92 and were studied by fermat ( see also eckert * [ 5 ] * or hatch * [ 7 ] * ) . this family is simply related to the * bh*-tree .",
    "it was also studied by hatch .",
    "recall the two row products @xmath93 and the two diagonal products @xmath94 formed from an * fb*. let @xmath95 rotate the values @xmath96 then the compact expression @xmath97 finds all three sides of the triangle for us ( these three equations were given separately above ) .    from this",
    "it is easy to set up four tangent circles @xmath98 for @xmath99 where @xmath100 has radius @xmath101 and center @xmath102 if we arrange the centers so that @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the diagonals of a rectangle of dimensions @xmath105 the equations show that all six pairs of circles are tangent , with @xmath106 enclosing the other three .",
    "we established in * [ 2 ] * that four of the six points of tangency lie on a line .",
    "reflection in that line exchanges the other two points of tangency .",
    "it follows that there is a congruent set of circles using the same six points of tangency .",
    "comparison of these circles with the four copies of the right triangle @xmath107 contained in the rectangle shows that these circles are also the in - circle and ex - circles !",
    "so the radii @xmath101 are as claimed .",
    "we have now laid the groundwork for viewing the old and the new tree .",
    "using our convenient * fb * representation , we can quite easily describe both trees .",
    "each one has a first level @xmath108 containing only the triple @xmath109,$ ] or equivalently , the box containing the sequence @xmath110.$ ]    each node on level @xmath111 generates three successors ( children ) on the next level .",
    "these successors may be called the _ left child _ , _ middle child _ , and",
    "_ right child _ ( the order is a bit arbitrary ) .",
    "hence level @xmath112 has @xmath113 occupants .    on the barning - hall tree ,",
    "flipping a column of a box is exchanging the two numbers",
    ". if @xmath114 is a primitive fibonacci box , let @xmath115 be obtained from @xmath114 by flipping the second column , both columns , and the first column .",
    "the result is an * fb * , but there is a unique @xmath116 which has the _ same first row_. in other words , discard the second row , and recompute .",
    "this defines the three children .",
    "it immediately follows from our definition that the first row product of any child is the same as one of the other products for the parent .",
    "for the ( left , middle , right ) child the first row product is exactly the product in the parent of the ( main diagonal , second row , back diagonal ) .",
    "briefly , the value @xmath117 has been replaced by a different radius @xmath118 our name for this is _",
    "circle promotion_. in effect , one of the three ex - circles is selected , then we say `` you are now the in - circle '' .",
    "suppose we have any primitive triple , with its primitive * fb * ( box ) .",
    "it is straightforward to reverse the process of column flipping , and show that this triple / box has a unique place on the tree .",
    "find the positive difference for each row , place the results in the first column ( the larger value must go on top ) , then ` complete the box ' . barning and hall both used a different method , the method of matrix transforms .",
