    "@xcite and na@xmath0(aq ) @xcite , such an inner shell is obvious from the most primitive observation , the radial distribution of water ( oxygens ) conditional on the atomic ion . for k@xmath0(aq ) that identification is less trivial , but that is the goal of this note .",
    "this is likely to be an issue of broader relevance to other ions in solution , for example , ho@xmath3(aq ) @xcite .",

    "the geometry of the inserted k@xmath0 cluster was first optimized in a separate _ ab initio _ calculation and , when placed in the simulation box , the cluster became 10-fold coordinated due to the proximity of two other water molecules in the box .",
    "it is the dynamical evolution of this initial configuration , determined within an _ ab initio _ framework , that is presented and analyzed here .",
