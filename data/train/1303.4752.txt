    "the verification of the correct classical limit of a theory of quantum gravity , i.e. general relativity ( gr ) , is the most basic and commonly agreed upon requirement we demand from it . for this",
    ", it is mandatory to have a thorough understanding of the classical theory .",
    "an interesting feature of the classical einstein - hilbert action for general relativity , which can serve as a non - trivial test of the classical limit(s ) of a quantum theory , we will encounter two candidate classical limits of loop quantum gravity . ] , was recently pointed out in @xcite . there",
    ", it was shown that the on - shell einstein - hilbert action with york - gibbons - hawking boundary term @xcite for a finite region always has an imaginary part , proportional to the area of the codimension-2 surfaces where the boundary normal becomes null .",
    "the imaginary part arises from analytically continuing the normal s angle near such surfaces , which one must do to avoid a pole singularityit is well known that the york - gibbons - hawking boundary term diverges for non - compact spatial slices ; see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "this divergence is however conceptually different and not the cause for the imaginary part of the action . ] in the york - gibbons - hawking boundary integral .",
    "an imaginary action in gr has been discussed long ago by gibbons and hawking @xcite in the context of a stationary black hole wick - rotated to euclidean spacetime . after correcting for an infinite constant and some terms related to conserved charges , the imaginary action of @xcite yields the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that an imaginary part is a much more general feature of gravitational actions , and that we should look for it in the classical limits of candidate quantum gravity theories .",
    "the general study of actions in finite regions , in particular for gravity , is motivated in more detail in section [ sec : finiteregions ] . as discussed in @xcite , the imaginary part of the action",
    "does not contribute to the variational principle .",
    "it is nevertheless interesting , due to its close relation with gravitational entropy .    in the classical limit , the ( effective ) on - shell action is related to transition",
    "amplitudes through the path integral formalism .",
    "therefore , models based on path - integral quantization are well suited for testing the above - mentioned feature of the gr action .",
    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite is a candidate theory of quantum gravity that comes both in a hamiltonian formulation and in a path integral framework , known as spinfoam models .",
    "the currently most studied spinfoam models are the eprl / fk models @xcite for which many results are known .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a recent review .",
    "in particular , one can study `` semiclassical '' coherent boundary states in the limit of large spins ( corresponding to large areas ) . in our context ,",
    "then , one would like to recover the imaginary part of the gr action from the spinfoam amplitudes for such states .",
    "we consider this issue in section [ sec : spinfoam ] .",
    "we find that the imaginary action is indeed recovered , but only if one sets the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 to @xmath1 at the end of the calculation .",
    "this is intriguing , since @xmath2 corresponds to self - dual ashtekar - barbero variables .",
    "we stress , however , that setting @xmath0 to @xmath1 is a formal procedure , since there is currently no detailed understanding of the quantum theory with @xmath0 non - real .    on a different route",
    ", one might be worried that the boundary term , and especially its imaginary part , might depend on the precise classical formulation .",
    "the results of @xcite were derived in a second - order framework .",
    "it is of interest to see if they survive in the first - order palatini action .",
    "in particular , the current spinfoam models are based on a modification of the palatini action , known as the holst action @xcite . in the literature",
    ", one can find a variety of boundary terms attributed to first - order actions .",
    "the boundary term cited for the palatini action is sometimes equivalent to the york - gibbons - hawking term @xcite , and sometimes not @xcite .",
    "the latter is suggested in @xcite to be better behaved , since it remains finite for asymptotically flat spatial slices . as for the holst modification",
    ", it may be given as just a curvature - proportional lagrangian @xcite , or just a torsion - proportional boundary term @xcite , or a combination of the lagrangian with a slightly different boundary term @xcite .",
    "the pure - boundary - term version is the integral of the nieh - yan topological density , thus implying that the holst modification is topological .    in section [ sec : boundaryterm ] , we argue for a single correct form of the first - order action .",
    "our action has a palatini boundary term as in @xcite , and a holst part consisting of _ both _ the lagrangian from @xcite and the boundary term from @xcite .",
    "our criteria for selecting the action are gauge invariance and a variational principle where only the boundary intrinsic metric must be kept fixed .",
    "the resulting action is equal on - shell to the second - order action , and therefore has the same imaginary part .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to discussion , focusing on the spinfoam results from section [ sec : spinfoam ] .",
    "we propose to view these results within a physical interpretation of the large - spin limit of lqg as a `` transplanckian '' high - energy regime . in this framework",
    ", we make contact between the perturbative running of @xmath0 in effective field theory @xcite and our proposal to set @xmath2 in the spinfoam calculation .",
    "we also place in this context some recent work @xcite on black hole entropy within loop quantum gravity . in particular , we point out a first - ever agreement within lqg between a black hole state counting and the bekenstein - hawking entropy as derived from an appropriate effective action .",
    "some of our remarks are speculative and should be taken with due care .",
    "in field theory , one always works with some sort of boundary data .",
    "the action principle restricts us to boundaries that are closed hypersurfaces , enveloping some region of spacetime .",
    "it is often convenient to place the boundary hypersurface at asymptotic infinity , either in whole or in part .",
    "one example is the calculation of s - matrix elements , where the `` in '' and `` out '' states are given on the asymptotic boundary of minkowski space .",
    "another example is when the initial and final states are given on two constant - time slices .",
    "these slices intersect at spatial infinity , thus forming a closed boundary .    on the other hand ,",
    "gravity actually forces us to consider physics in finite regions .",
    "this is because spacetime curvature together with causality can make asymptotic infinity inaccessible from certain locations .",
    "the prime example is an observer inside a black hole . at the cosmological scale",
    ", it appears that _ all _ observers are in a similar predicament , due to the universe s accelerating expansion . in both scenarios ,",
    "one encounters the notion of a finite entropy associated with the causal horizon .    given these circumstances , it is interesting to learn about any peculiarities of field theory that are specific to finite regions with lorentzian causality .",
    "an important source of such peculiarities is the presence of `` signature - flip '' surfaces .",
    "these are codimension-2 surfaces where the boundary changes its signature from spacelike to timelike ( or vice versa ) , and momentarily becomes null .",
    "any closed boundary must contain such surfaces .",
    "the flip surfaces may be `` hidden '' in topological corners , where the boundary `` makes a sharp turn '' in a non - differentiable manner .",
    "for example , a closed boundary composed of two spacelike hypersurfaces , one `` initial '' and one `` final '' , carries two signature flips in the corner where the two hypersurfaces intersect . see figure [ fig : spacelike_boundary ] .",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] +    at corners and/or flip surfaces , some standard tools of analytical mechanics can not be taken for granted .",
    "this is related to the fact that the boundary - value problem for hyperbolic differential equations ( i.e. for lorentzian causality ) is ill - defined . as a result , the usual formalism of boundary - data variations does nt hold at all points of a closed boundary , but breaks down at the corners and flip surfaces .",
    "in particular , tangential and normal gradients on such surfaces can not be treated as independent .",
    "this affects the counting of degrees of freedom , as well as the locality properties of action variations .",
    "one usually avoids these issues by keeping the boundary data on these surfaces fixed and not worrying about contributions that arise from them .",
    "this is quite natural when the surfaces are `` hidden '' at asymptotic infinity , where all the dynamical fields fall off .",
    "however , in the presence of gravity , this point of view becomes problematic .",
    "first , as mentioned above , asymptotic infinity may be physically inaccessible .",
    "second , the boundary s metric and extrinsic curvature are now dynamical variables , and their values at infinity contribute to the action .",
    "this is the source of the divergence mentioned in footnote [ ftn : divergence ] .",
    "thus , we are interested in studying actions in finite spacetime regions with an emphasis on the effects of corners and flip surfaces .",
    "the hope is to learn from this something about the degrees of freedom of quantum gravity in such regions . in @xcite",
    ", this approach was followed for the case of closed null boundaries . from the perspective presented above , this is an extreme case , since the boundary is null not just on isolated surfaces , but everywhere .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that for gr in a null - bounded region , a careful evaluation of the action @xmath3 reveals an _",
    "imaginary part_. this conclusion was extended to general closed boundaries in @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part arises from the action s boundary term , which requires analytical continuation in the vicinity of a flip surface .",
    "its value closely resembles the black hole entropy formula , and can be written as : @xmath4 here , the sum is over flip surfaces , @xmath5 is the area of each surface , and @xmath6 is the entropy functional @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the calculation was also extended to lovelock gravity , using the action with the appropriate boundary term @xcite .",
    "this resulted again in an imaginary part @xmath8 , related in the same way as in to the appropriate entropy formula @xcite .",
    "we note again the similarity to gibbons and hawking s calculation @xcite , where black hole entropy was derived from an imaginary action .",
    "the motivation there , however , was somewhat different .",
    "a wick rotation was performed to avoid the physical singularity in the black hole s interior . as a result",
    ", the calculation was restricted to stationary spacetimes , and did not involve finite regions .",
    "it is well - known that the einstein - hilbert action of gr must be supplemented with the york - gibbons - hawking boundary term @xcite to ensure a well - defined variational principle .",
    "the resulting action reads : @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is a spacetime region with boundary @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the space - time metric , with signature @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the ricci scalar , with the sign convention @xmath15v^\\mu$ ] for the riemann tensor @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the metric induced on @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath18 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath19 .",
    "the sign of the boundary normal @xmath20 is chosen so that the _ covector _ @xmath21 is outgoing , i.e. so that @xmath20 has positive scalar product with outgoing vectors . see figure [ fig : smooth_normal ] .",
    "the factor of @xmath22 in the denominator makes valid for both spacelike and timelike patches of @xmath23 and for arbitrary norm of @xmath20 .",
    "null regions are dealt with via an analytic continuation .",
    "@xmath24 are spacetime tensor indices , while @xmath25 are tensor indices on @xmath11 .",
    "+    thanks to the boundary term , the action contains only first derivatives .",
    "it is then stationary under the einstein equations with @xmath26 on @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , it s worth noting that a canonical analysis of the action leads to the adm energy and momentum @xcite as the boundary terms of the hamiltonian and spatial diffeomorphism constraints .",
    "a recent review of these results with extensions to @xmath27 theories can be found in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the second - order metric formulation , gr can also be described by the first - order palatini action . there , one varies the co - vierbein @xmath28 and the so@xmath29-connection @xmath30 independently .",
    "we use indices @xmath31 for spacetime coordinates , indices @xmath32 for the internal minkowski space , and indices @xmath33 for coordinates on the boundary of our spatial region . out of @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    ", we define the curvature @xmath36 , the area - bivector 2-form @xmath37 and the densitized boundary normal @xmath38 : @xmath39 our convention for the components of differential forms is @xmath40}$ ] .",
    "the spacetime levi - civita density is @xmath41 , with inverse @xmath42 . for the boundary",
    ", we have likewise @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we define the relative sign of @xmath43 and @xmath41 such that @xmath45 has a positive scalar product with outgoing vectors .",
    "the internal levi - civita tensor is @xmath46 or @xmath47 ; the two versions are related through raising and lowering with the flat metric @xmath48 , and are _ minus _ each other s inverses .",
    "we assume for now that the vierbein has a positive determinant @xmath49 .",
    "this assumption can be thought of as @xmath42 and @xmath47 `` having the same sign '' .",
    "the case of negative @xmath50 will be discussed in section [ sec : boundaryterm : det_e ] . with these sign conventions ,",
    "the direction of the normal @xmath38 is as depicted in figure [ fig : smooth_normal ] .    with these ingredients in place ,",
    "we argue for the following form of the palatini action @xcite : @xmath51 the two expressions are equivalent due to the fact that @xmath52 has one of its internal indices in the direction of @xmath38 .",
    "the action is more commonly written in terms of a unit normal .",
    "the densitized normal has two advantages .",
    "first , it is a simple polynomial function of the @xmath34 .",
    "second , it remains non - singular when the boundary becomes null , while the unit normal diverges .",
    "it is thus better suited for describing flip surfaces .",
    "alternatively , one can write the action in terms of an undensitized , _ non - unit _",
    "normal @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the covariant derivative of @xmath53 . in this formulation ,",
    "rescalings of @xmath53 constitute a gauge freedom .",
    "using @xmath53 is perhaps more intuitive , and we will do so in our analysis of the action .",
    "the relation between @xmath38 and @xmath53 is : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the determinant of the boundary metric @xmath58 .    when written in the form , the action is manifestly gauge - invariant .",
    "it is also clear that the boundary term agrees on - shell with the york - gibbons - hawking boundary term from .",
    "more precisely , the boundary terms agree when @xmath35 coincides with the spin connection of @xmath34 .",
    "this `` half - shell '' condition results from varying the action with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "it is well - known that the bulk terms also agree under the same condition .",
    "we conclude that our palatini action coincides on - shell with the second - order action .",
    "as we ll see in more detail in section [ sec : boundaryterm : corners ] , this implies that they also have the same imaginary part .",
    "let us examine the ingredients of the palatini boundary term in more detail .",
    "first , consider the action with no boundary term at all .",
    "its variation @xmath59 on a solution is a boundary integral of @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the variational principle contains boundary conditions on @xmath61 rather than on @xmath62 .",
    "now , the @xmath63 piece of the action s boundary term turns @xmath59 into a boundary integral of @xmath64 .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions become @xmath65 , with @xmath66 arbitrary . as we will see in section [ sec : boundaryterm : corners ] , the @xmath67 piece of the boundary term allows for slightly weaker boundary conditions , in agreement with the second - order variational principle .    in the literature @xcite ,",
    "one can find boundary terms that consist solely of the @xmath68 piece . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "if one adopts the time gauge @xmath69 on the boundary , then the @xmath68 piece is invariant under the residual gauge transformations .",
    "one can then argue that the action is sufficiently gauge - invariant without an @xmath67 piece in the boundary term .",
    "however , in our context of closed boundaries , the question is irrelevant : time gauge is just not available globally . in lorentzian spacetime , this is obvious due to changes in the normal s signature and/or time - orientation .",
    "in fact , time gauge is not available in the euclidean either , for topological reasons : though one can choose a frame on the boundary where @xmath70 is constant , one can not extend it smoothly into the region s bulk . for",
    "a simple example , consider a circular boundary in a euclidean plane .",
    "we conclude , then , that the @xmath67 piece of the boundary term is essential for a gauge - invariant action .",
    "this in turn implies that a sensible palatini action must agree on - half - shell with the second - order action . in the next subsection",
    ", we will see how the @xmath67 piece is responsible for corner contributions and for the action s imaginary part .",
    "the @xmath67 piece of the palatini boundary term restores gauge invariance after the introduction of the @xmath68 term . as a result",
    ", it allows for weaker boundary conditions in the variational principle . due to the action s gauge invariance",
    ", we can now allow boundary variations of @xmath71 , as long as the intrinsic metric variation @xmath58 stays fixed ( @xmath72 remains arbitrary ) . on smooth patches of the boundary ,",
    "this new condition is gauge - equivalent to simply keeping @xmath71 fixed .",
    "indeed , the three minkowski vectors @xmath71 are determined by their scalar products @xmath17 , up to rotations in the internal space .    at corners , where the boundary turns abruptly by a nonzero angle , the boundary conditions @xmath65 and @xmath26 are _ no longer _ gauge - equivalent .",
    "fixing @xmath71 at corners is a slightly too strong condition : in addition to the intrinsic metric , it fixes also the corner angle , which should properly be part of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "fixing @xmath58 instead leaves the corner angles free to vary , and is equivalent to the standard boundary conditions of second - order gravity .",
    "the merit of this choice of boundary conditions is that it keeps the fixed data on the boundary to a minimum .",
    "given free variations of the corner angles , one is forced by the variational principle @xcite to take into account corner contributions @xcite to the action s boundary term .",
    "corner contributions will be crucial in section [ sec : spinfoam ] , since the 4-simplex action studied there consists of nothing else .",
    "the @xmath67 piece of the boundary term not only leads to a variational principle that necessitates corner contributions .",
    "it also contains the corner contributions themselves . to begin with ,",
    "consider a flat solution .",
    "there , one can choose coordinates and a gauge frame such that @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in this frame ,",
    "the bulk term and the @xmath68 boundary term in both vanish , for any chosen region . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath67 term does not vanish .",
    "in fact , it precisely captures the york - gibbons - hawking contribution from the boundary s extrinsic curvature .",
    "in particular , for regions @xmath10 that are effectively 1 + 1-dimensional ( say , the other two dimensions form a flat torus ) , the on - shell action reads : @xmath75 here , @xmath76 is the normal s rotation angle ( actually , boost parameter ) in the 1 + 1d space , while @xmath77 is the area of the two transverse dimensions . to see this , it might be helpful to write @xmath18 as @xmath78 ( recall our flat frame choice ) , where @xmath79 .",
    "the example of an effectively 1 + 1d region in flat spacetime is less artificial than it may seem . in particular",
    ", it applies in the infinitesimal neighborhood of a corner surface .",
    "this is because the boundary s extrinsic curvature in the orthogonal 1 + 1d plane is arbitrarily larger than the gradients of @xmath34 or the components of @xmath35 ( assuming a smooth gauge frame ) .",
    "therefore , the flat 1 + 1d discussion captures the fate of the corner contributions @xcite to the york - gibbons - hawking boundary term .",
    "we see that the corner contributions are due entirely to the @xmath67 piece of the boundary term",
    ".    now , as explained in @xcite , the signature - flip surfaces on @xmath11 behave like corners , whether or not they coincide with corners in the topological sense .",
    "the `` corner contribution '' from these surfaces is responsible for the imaginary part of the on - shell action , and is due to the imaginary part of the `` corner angle '' .",
    "we conclude that the imaginary part @xmath8 is again due to the @xmath67 boundary term .    in more detail , at a signature - flip surface , when the boundary becomes momentarily null , the @xmath22 in the denominator in - vanishes ( assuming the extent of @xmath53 is kept finite ) .",
    "this leads to a divergence in the boundary term s integrand .",
    "this is the same situation that was studied for the york - gibbons - hawking boundary term in @xcite .",
    "as explained there , the divergence in the boundary term is simply the divergence in the angle integral as the normal approaches a null direction .",
    "the regularization of the angle integral yields an imaginary part @xmath80 , depending on a choice of analytical continuation . in the action",
    ", this translates into the imaginary part . in terms of the action s bounadry term ,",
    "the analytical continuation involved is equivalent to regularizing the denominator as @xmath81 .",
    "the sign of @xmath82 , and thus of @xmath8 , is chosen so that @xmath8 is non - negative .",
    "this means that transition amplitudes @xmath83 are exponentially damped rather than exponentially exploding .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , this damping seems consistent with the multiplicity of states associated with gravitational entropy .",
    "the palatini action can be supplemented by the so - called holst modification @xcite , without changing the equations of motion . together with the appropriate boundary term",
    ", the action then reads : @xmath84 where @xmath0 is a real nonzero constant .",
    "the first line is the palatini action from section [ sec : boundaryterm : palatini ] , while the second line describes the holst modification .",
    "the above expression makes clear the dependence on the fundamental variables . to make gauge invariance manifest ,",
    "we can rewrite eq . as : @xmath85 using a non - densitized normal @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath86 term in the boundary integral in performs the same function as the @xmath68 term in the palatini action - it ensures that the variational principle fixes metric data on the boundary rather than connection data .",
    "the @xmath87 term then performs the same function as the @xmath88 term in the palatini action - it restores full gauge invariance , and allows for a variational principle where only the intrinsic boundary metric @xmath89 is held fixed . unlike the @xmath88 term , the @xmath87 term has no denominators , and is polynomial in @xmath34",
    ". it does nt diverge at corners or flip surfaces , and thus does nt require analytical continuation .",
    "it is easy to see that the on - shell action is unaffected by the holst modification .",
    "both the bulk and boundary integrands in the second line of vanish , due to the `` half - shell '' identities : @xmath90 the first equation in is the defining property of the spin - connection , while the second is the bianchi identity .",
    "we conclude that on - shell , the holst action coincides with the modified palatini action , and therefore also with the second - order action .",
    "the holst modification does have an effect on the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "a canonical analysis of the holst action leads to the ashtekar - barbero variables @xcite , with @xmath0 as the barbero - immirzi parameter . from a hamiltonian point of view , different values of @xmath0 amount to canonical transformations @xcite .",
    "while @xmath0 does not affect the physics at the classical level , it becomes important in loop quantum gravity @xcite , where it appears as a quantization ambiguity .",
    "here , the canonical transformation describing a change of @xmath0 can not be implemented on the holonomy - flux algebra ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which leads to unitarily inequivalent quantum theories @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 can thus enter the spectra of physical observables @xcite , and predictions of the quantum theory can depend on it .",
    "it has been debated in the literature @xcite whether one should use the nieh - yan topological density @xmath91 instead of the holst modification as the classical starting point for loop quantum gravity . the argument in favor of the nieh - yan density is that because it s truly topological , it does not affect the fermion coupling in the lagrangian ( see however @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", the theory with fermions remains insensitive to the barbero - immirzi parameter at the classical level .",
    "however , our analysis above shows that to have a variational principle with arbitrary @xmath66 on the boundary , one must use a combination of the holst and nieh - yan terms given in .",
    "this subtlety will also be important when discussing the running of the barbero - immirzi parameter , since prefactors of topological terms , e.g. the @xmath92-angle in qcd , are not expected to run in perturbation theory .",
    "as a side remark , the action can be written in a manifestly dual way as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a functional of @xmath71 known as the peldan hybrid connection @xcite .      in the above calculations , we ve been assuming @xmath95 .",
    "let us now consider the action s behavior when both signs of @xmath50 are allowed",
    ". this will be relevant to the spinfoam results in section [ sec : spinfoam ] .",
    "we build here on the discussion in @xcite .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath50 encodes the orientation of the internal space with respect to the spacetime manifold .",
    "thus , changing this sign can be viewed as a parity or time - reversal transformation .    when @xmath50 changes sign , both the bulk and boundary terms in the palatini action acquire a sign factor .",
    "thus , for @xmath96 , the real part of evaluates on - shell to _ minus _ the real part of the second - order action . as for the imaginary part , recall that its sign is determined by a choice between two complex - conjugate analytical continuations of the boundary normal s angle @xcite .",
    "the requirement that quantum amplitudes @xmath83 do not explode exponentially forces us to choose a positive @xmath8 , regardless of the sign of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , the relative sign between the real and imaginary parts of the boundary term , i.e. the choice of analytical continuation , must be different for @xmath95 and for @xmath96 .",
    "alternatively , one can multiply the palatini action by a factor of @xmath97 ( in the classical theory , this sign will be constant everywhere , assuming that @xmath50 does nt vanish ) : @xmath98 the action is invariant under changes to @xmath97 , and its real part always evaluates on - shell to the second - order action . as a result , the same analytical continuation gives a positive @xmath99 for both signs of @xmath50 .",
    "the price we pay is that the action functional is no longer fully analytical in the co - vierbein .",
    "the sign function in can be analytically continued either from positive @xmath50 or from negative @xmath50 .",
    "the two continuations give the constant functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 , thus forming two separate analytical domains .",
    "we see that there is a tradeoff in terms of analyticity . for the action - , different signs of @xmath50 require different analytical continuations for the normal s angle . on the other hand , with the action",
    ", we must contend with the two separate analytical domains of the sign function @xmath97 .",
    "the appearance of two analytical domains is related to the 4-volume density @xmath102 in the second - order action . in terms of the vierbein",
    ", we have @xmath103 , and therefore : @xmath104 while shows where the non - analytical factor of @xmath97 comes from , it is instructive to consider the function @xmath105 in its own right .",
    "the square - root function has a branch cut induced by the choice @xmath106 .",
    "this means that a half - line , e.g. @xmath107 for some angle @xmath108 , must be removed from its domain . for the function @xmath105",
    ", this implies removing from the complex @xmath50 plane a whole line containing @xmath109 , e.g. @xmath110 .",
    "this line splits the complex plane into two separate domains , one containing the positive half of the real line , and the other containing the negative half .",
    "similar considerations apply to the holst action - . under a change in @xmath97 , the first line in changes sign , while the second line ( the @xmath111 term ) is invariant . since the second line vanishes on - shell , the comparison with the second - order action and the choice of analytical continuation for the angle play out as before .",

    "as the signature flips that lead to an imaginary action are a crucially lorentzian feature , we focus on the lorentzian spinfoam model .    since the model is based on an action formula only heuristically , we must look at its output , i.e. at the transition amplitudes . in a classical limit",

    "in the previous sections , two main observations were made . in section [ sec : boundaryterm ] , we ve shown that the imaginary part of the gr action resulting from the york - gibbons - hawking boundary term is present also in first - order formulations . in section [ sec : spinfoam ] , we ve shown that this imaginary part can also be recovered in a semi - classical analysis of the eprl / fk spinfoam model , by analytically continuing the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 to @xmath1 in the final result .    the original motivation for even considering this analytical continuation stems from the recent observation @xcite that the bekenstein - hawking entropy with the correct numerical coefficient can be obtained within loop quantum gravity by a similar procedure .",

    "the value of @xmath0 is arbitrary , and has no effect on the action . on the other hand , in the large - spin limit of the spinfoam model",
    ", @xmath0 must take the values @xmath1 for the effective action to have the correct gr - like behavior , in particular the correct imaginary part .",
    "this leads us to suspect a sort of rg flow between the two regimes . to make this statement more precise",
    ", we must understand what is meant by the large - spin limit .    before anything else",
    ", the large - spin limit of lqg is a mathematical structure . as such",
    ", it may enter physics in different contexts . in the spinfoam literature ,",
    "the large - spin limit is often referred to as `` the '' semiclassical limit of lqg , with the implication that it produces the classical continuum gr that we observe at large distances .",
    "see e.g. @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the magnitude of the spins defines a mesoscopic scale , set between the planck scale and the scale of continuum wavelengths that one wishes to describe . at this mesoscopic scale , some set of observables , e.g. areas and angles in regge gravity , takes the values of a chosen classical geometry , with small relative uncertainties .",
    "the continuum emerges from adding together such semiclassical discrete elements .",
    "a similar picture emerges in the canonical framework .",
    "there , one approximates phase - space points of classical gr by coherent states on a fixed graph , with fluctuating magnitudes of the spins .",
    "one chooses a graph with sufficiently many links and nodes so that the continuum is well - approximated , but sufficiently few so that the relative uncertainties are minimized . see chapter 11 of @xcite and @xcite for a discussion and @xcite for original literature .",
    "approaches of this kind are potentially valid , if one views graphs with large spins as a coarse - graining of finer graphs with small spins , in a spirit similar to rg flow .",
    "however , the details of such a coarse - graining procedure , in particular the link between @xmath169 and @xmath115 , are not well - understood .",
    "of course , if lqg is correct , there must be _ some _ coarse - graining procedure that results in continuum gr .",
    "this procedure may or may not involve the mathematical structure of the large - spin limit .",
    "we in this section will consider `` the '' large - spin limit in a more straightforward context - as the special subset of states in the fundamental theory that happen to have large spin labels , with no coarse - graining implied . in particular , the couplings @xmath170 and @xmath0 are the same as those in the fundamental theory ( which need not be the case in the coarse - graining picture ) .",
    "note that this regime necessarily exists in lqg , whatever ones opinion about using large spins for coarse - graining .",
    "the `` classical gr '' that this limit reproduces is a discretized version of the gr that was quantized to obtain lqg .",
    "this is not the same as the observed gr , which is meant to emerge through coarse - graining .",
    "indeed , we ve already noted two differences between the two `` classical gr s '' .",
    "the observed gr lives in the continuum and is not sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the gr of the large - spin limit is discrete ( like regge gravity ) and sensitive to @xmath0 ( unlike regge gravity ) .",
    "thus , we view the effective action at large spins as distinct from the action of the observed , continuum gr .",
    "therefore , the requirement for the large - spin effective action to have the correct classical form does not really follow from consistency with the continuum theory .",
    "instead , we see it as a consistency check on the quantization procedure itself .",
    "what , then , is the physical meaning of this non - coarse - grained large - spin limit ? clearly , it describes the interaction of very large `` atoms of space '' , with characteristic length @xmath171 .",
    "in quantum gravity , a large geometric size may arise both in a low - energy context and in a high - energy context . here , `` low - energy '' and `` high - energy '' should be understood as much lower or much higher than the planck scale , which ( for finite @xmath0 ) is the natural scale of lqg .",
    "the low - energy context refers to particles with wavelength @xmath172 .",
    "their characteristic action over a single wavelength is ( by definition ) @xmath173 .",
    "this leads to the inverse scaling of energy with wavelength as @xmath174 .",
    "the high - energy context , on the other hand , refers to black holes with schwarzschild radius @xmath172 .",
    "the characteristic energy is then the black hole s mass , which scales as @xmath175 .",
    "we argue that the large distances associated with large spins should be viewed in a _",
    "high_-energy context .",
    "indeed , long wavelengths with low energy imply a perturbation over a background spacetime .",
    "in contrast , a large - spin state in lqg _ determines _ the structure of spacetime , much like a heavy black hole .",
    "this is further supported by the picture of lqg intertwiners as miniature `` quantum black holes '' @xcite . in that picture ,",
    "large spins imply a large `` black hole '' , and therefore high energy in the sense of a large `` schwarzschild radius '' .",
    "another argument is that the action of e.g. a large - spin 4-simplex scales as @xmath176 , which suggests an energy @xmath177 , as for a black hole .    in this way",
    ", we arrive at a picture of the large - spin limit as the regime where atoms of space with transplanckian energy interact . in particle - physics terms",
    ", the analogous situation is a scattering process of two particles with center - of - mass energy @xmath178 .",
    "the large - spin limit corresponds to the early stages of such a process , before the energy is dissipated into light degrees of freedom . after this dissipation",
    ", it is believed that the state should be viewed as a classical black hole , following the rules of the observed classical gr ( see e.g. @xcite ) . before the dissipation ,",
    "properly transplanckian physics takes place .",
    "there is no a - priori reason that this physics should be described by anything resembling gr . in lqg",
    "( as opposed to string theory ) , the fundamental theory is a quantization of gr _ by assumption_. as a result , through the mechanism of coherent states with large quantum numbers , fundamental transplanckian processes _ are _ described by a ( discrete ) classical - gr limit .",
    "however , we stress again that this is not the same limit as the continuum gr describing classical gravity in the observed world .",
    "we stress also that the large - spin limit is `` transplanckian '' only in the sense of high energies , not in the sense of small distances .",
    "degrees of freedom that are transplanckian in both senses at once are very likely ruled out on general grounds @xcite .",
    "note also that while we talk about transplanckian energies concentrated in single spins , this does _ not _ imply a higher - than - planck energy density . indeed , since we argued that the energy scales as @xmath179 , the energy density scales as @xmath180 .",
    "we conclude that the two classical gr s are in fact two _ opposite _ putative limits of the quantum theory , in terms of the energies of the quanta involved .",
    "the observed continuum gr corresponds to a low - energy `` ir regime '' of subplanckian quanta ( gravitons ) .",
    "it results from a coarse - graining procedure , which may or may not involve a large - spin description .",
    "the discrete classical gr of the large - spin limit corresponds to a high - energy `` uv regime '' of transplanckian quanta ( spins and intertwiners ) .",
    "it results from substituting large values for the spins , with no coarse - graining implied .",
    "the situation is summarized in figure [ fig : limits ] .",
    "it is somewhat analogous to the situation in qcd , which becomes two different free theories in the uv and in the ir ( a theory of quarks and gluons in the former , and a theory of pions in the latter ) .",
    "+      a coherent picture now emerges with respect to the running of @xmath0 . in the ir ,",
    "the continuum gr is insensitive to the value of @xmath0 . in the uv",
    ", the discrete gr of the large - spin limit prefers @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath0 `` runs '' from an arbitrary value in the ir to a uv fixed point .",
    "we stress that this `` running '' is not necessarily well - defined at the intermediate , planck - scale energies . in the regime where individual spins are both small and relevant",
    ", it is quite possible that the dynamics is not described by any gr - like effective action .",
    "interestingly , a similar picture for the flow of @xmath0 was recently obtained in a very different framework . in @xcite ,",
    "benedetti and speziale studied the 1-loop running of @xmath0 in effective field theory for the holst action with a minimally coupled fermion .",
    "the calculation was done in a euclidean framework , where the self - dual connection corresponds to @xmath181 rather than @xmath2 .",
    "it was found that @xmath0 runs from an arbitrary initial value in the subplanckian ir to the self - dual value @xmath182 in the transplanckian uv .",
    "it is tempting to analytically continue this statement to the lorentzian , saying that @xmath0 runs from an arbitrary ir value to @xmath1 in the uv .",
    "this convergence between the perturbative picture and the one suggested by large - spin amplitudes is exciting , and indeed motivated our reasoning in section [ sec : discussion : largespin ] .",
    "nevertheless , some obvious caveats should be mentioned .",
    "first , we stress again that we can not directly make sense of a quantum theory with complex @xmath0 , be it in a perturbative framework or in lqg .",
    "second , the perturbative running can not really be trusted beyond the planck energy . at best",
    ", it is suggestive of what should happen at transplanckian energies , with the suggestion borne out by the large - spin limit of lqg .",
    "finally , we should note that contradictory results for the running of @xmath0 in pure gr have been obtained in @xcite in a 1-loop perturbative calculation , as well as in @xcite in the asymptotic safety framework .",
    "however , those results refer to gauge - dependent quantities , and their significance is not clear to us .",
    "a last comment concerning the running is in order . as observed in section [ sec : boundaryterm : holst ] , @xmath0 appears in the classical action as the prefactor of a combination of the holst modification and the nieh - yan density . in other words ,",
    "when demanding a well - defined variational principle , it is not valid to use either the holst modification or the nieh - yan density individually .",
    "this point is important because one could object when that using the nieh - yan density as a modification for the palatini action , the barbero - immirzi parameter would not run due to the topological nature of the nieh - yan density .",
    "this issue is also discussed from a different perspective in @xcite .",
    "the black hole entropy calculation proposed in @xcite has been our initial motivation for considering the substitution @xmath2 in the large - spin formula . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose to compute the black hole entropy within lqg in the large - spin limit by fixing the number of spin - network punctures on the horizon and setting @xmath0 to @xmath1 . as a result",
    ", the formula for the dimension of the chern - simons theory describing the horizon obtains a dominant term , and the resulting entropy is given by @xmath7 .",
    "another work in this vein is @xcite , where the authors studied an lqg quantization of gr conformally coupled to a scalar field .",
    "there , one can count states resulting from a classical gauge - fixing of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the entropy of these states comes out with a wrong dependency on the scalar field , unless one employs the reasoning of @xcite and chooses @xmath0 to reflect the self - dual case .",
    "the calculation in @xcite is conceptually different from previous entropy calculations in lqg , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that in @xcite , one fixes the number of punctures . from the perspective of a continuum gr limit ( the low - energy `` ir limit '' of section [ sec : discussion : largespin ] )",
    ", one would expect instead to sum over all spin - network configurations with a given total area .",
    "it then follows that graphs with small spins dominate the entropy @xcite . on the other hand , in the high - energy `` uv limit '' from section [ sec : discussion : largespin ] , it is natural to construct a `` black hole '' from a limited number of large area elements . of course",
    ", this object does not coincide with what is usually meant by a black hole in continuum gr .",
    "however , it is the natural `` transplanckian '' analogue , given the interpretation of a continuum black hole as a large intertwiner @xcite .",
    "we note that the `` transplanckian '' black hole should be viewed as a temporary state : with time , it should thermalize into a continuum black hole , which in lqg will be described by many small spins .",
    "it is thus conceptually similar to the early stages of a particle collision with transplanckian center - of - mass energy .",
    "since the `` transplanckian '' black hole does not correspond to the continuum gr limit , there is also no need for its entropy to coincide with what is usually referred to as the bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
    "in fact , the entropy derived in @xcite is @xmath7 in terms of the _ high_-energy newton s constant , i.e. the bare newton s",
    "constant @xmath170 from the definition of lqg .",
    "this entropy is in agreement with what one would expect from the effective ( discrete ) gr action in the `` transplanckian '' large - spin limit of spinfoams , which is given in terms of the same @xmath170 .",
    "in contrast , the usual bekenstein - hawking entropy is given in terms of the effective low - energy @xmath170 of the continuum theory .",
    "there is no a priori reason why the newton s constants in the two different classical limits should coincide .",
    "the entropy calculation proposed in @xcite should thus be interpreted within the `` transplanckian '' regime .",
    "this is in contrast to the previous calculations such as @xcite , which aim at the continuum limit .",
    "the two main assumptions of @xcite , i.e. setting @xmath0 to @xmath1 and considering a fixed number of spins , seem to make sense only in the `` transplanckian '' context , where they agree with the independent results from spinfoam asymptotics and from perturbative calculations .    together , our spinfoam calculation and the black hole state counting of @xcite paint a consistent quantitative picture .",
    "there is a semiclassical limit of lqg , defined by large spins and an analytic continuation to @xmath2 . in this limit",
    ", one can calculate an effective action from the spinfoam vertex .",
    "this action has the correct form prescribed by classical gr , including the correct relation between its real and imaginary parts . from the effective action",
    ", one can derive semiclassically the bekenstein - hawking entropy formula .",
    "_ independently _ , one can carry out a black hole state counting in the same limit , obtaining an entropy in agreement with the one derived from the action .",
    "this agreement between a statistical state counting and the bekenstein - hawking formula is the first of its kind within loop quantum gravity .      as argued above , setting @xmath0 to @xmath1 for large spins",
    "has an interpretation as a `` transplanckian '' limit in the sense of large schwarzschild radii .",
    "now , the natural question arises whether setting @xmath0 to @xmath1 could also have an interpretation in terms of a ( to be understood ) coarse graining procedure . while we are not aware of direct arguments leading to this conclusion , we want to remark that all the above observations are also consistent with the coarse graining picture in the following ( more or less vague ) sense : in the coarse graining picture , the correct physical result is obtained by performing the calculation for arbitrary real @xmath0 in the large spin limit and sending @xmath0 to @xmath1 after all calculations have been performed .",
    "this is especially attractive for the black hole entropy calculation , because a fixed number of ( large spin ) punctures would already incorporate , by the definition of coarse graining , all possible subdivisions into small spins .",
    "it is however unclear to us how sending @xmath0 to @xmath1 could result from a coarse graining procedure .",
    "in this paper , we built on the recent observation that the second - order gr action for bounded regions has an imaginary part .",
    "we established that the same imaginary part is present also in first - order formulations of gravity .",
    "it was then shown that this imaginary part can be recovered from the large - spin asymptotics of the eprl / fk spinfoam model , by analytically continuing the result from real barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath0 to @xmath2 .",
    "we proposed to view this limit as a `` transplanckian '' regime of lqg , in the sense of high energies but not of small distances .",
    "we argued that it s natural for the effective action in this regime to describe a discretized version of gr , governed by the high - energy newton s constant .",
    "further evidence for this point of view coming from a perturbative calculation and black hole entropy calculations has been discussed .",
    "while the calculations in sections [ sec : boundaryterm ] and [ sec : spinfoam ] are robust , the arguments in the discussion section [ sec : discussion ] are more intuitive and should be taken with due care . again ,",
    "especially statements about the running of @xmath0 to @xmath1 in full lorentzian lqg are only formal , since the quantum theory is ill - defined for non - real @xmath0 .",
