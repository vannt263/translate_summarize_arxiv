    "the physics of rydberg atoms and molecules has developed into a quasi - sustainable `` ecosystem '' over the last decade , mainly due to a ) the exaggerated properties of rydberg atoms and molecules ( long lifetimes , large sizes , and scalability ) , and b ) exquisite experimental control over these properties through the advent of ultracold atomic rydberg samples @xcite .",
    "some landmark developments over the last few years in the field of rydberg physics have been the creation of a frozen rydberg gas @xcite , the demonstration of a rydberg blockade scheme and the subsequent realization of a rydberg qubit gate @xcite , the formation of ultralong - range isotropic rydberg molecule @xcite , the creation ultracold neutral plasmas @xcite , as well as the formation of highly - magnetized rydberg antihydrogen atoms @xcite .",
    "these rapid advances now allow for few - body and many - body effects to be realized in laboratory settings and be prototyped for simulation of strongly interacting spin chains @xcite .",
    "the other ingredient of our proposed polyatomic rydberg complex , namely , ultracold polar molecules , have also been touted as toy models for the simulation of many - body condensed systems and for the realization of quantum gates @xcite .",
    "a main appeal of polar molecules is that they may possess sizeable permanent dipole moments .    in this work ,",
    "we harness the long - range interaction of a rydberg atom with a polar molecule ( rb is used as an ubiquitous example , but other alkali metal atoms would serve the purpose ) , to demonstrate that ultralong - range polyatomic molecules with enormous permanent dipole moments can form from combining a rydberg atom and a polar molecule .",
    "this system was first studied in @xcite where it was shown that the rydberg electron can be used to `` drag '' the polar molecule into a preferred orientation and that this process can be controlled by a raman microwave pulse scheme .",
    "ultralong range rydberg molecules in general came in vogue after a proposal that such molecules could form from zero - range interaction of electrons with ground state atoms @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental realization of a class of such molecules @xcite has led to revived theoretical and experimental activity @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the polar perturber with the rydberg atom strongly couples the field - free atomic rydberg states by means of the dipole s electric field . in @xcite , the mixing of states",
    "was restricted to the nearly degenerate ( negligible quantum defects ) manifold of rydberg states in rb(@xmath2 ) . in the present work ,",
    "we extend our previous study by going beyond this degenerate perturbation theory approach . in this manner ,",
    "the effect of additional rydberg orbitals on the molecular born - oppenheimer ( bo ) potentials is probed . in particular",
    ", the proximity of the @xmath1 rydberg manifold to a single @xmath0 state introduces a strong coupling , allowing for the experimental preparation of the proposed polyatomic rydberg molecules via a standard two - photon laser excitation .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section [ sec : polarmolec ] the model hamiltonian describing the polar molecule perturber is introduced .",
    "the adiabatic hamiltonian for the full rydberg atom plus polar molecule complex is subsequently provided in section [ sec : adiabatich ] .",
    "the resulting adiabatic potential surfaces are discussed in section [ sec : bo ] . in section",
    "v we discuss the admixture of @xmath3-wave electron character in the giant rydberg molecule .",
    "we conclude by a brief summary and an outlook on further research directions in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "before we discuss the properties of the proposed polyatomic rydberg molecules , we must introduce an effective hamiltonian for the molecular perturber . in this context , we model the polar molecule as a two - level molecule in which the opposite parity states are mixed in the presence of an external field , i.e. , @xmath4{cc}0 & d_{0}f_{ext}\\\\ d_{0}f_{ext } & \\delta \\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{eq : h_mol}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the zero field splitting between the two molecular states ( as in a @xmath6-doublet molecule ) , @xmath7 is the permanent dipole moment of the molecule in the body fixed frame , and @xmath8 is an electric field external to the polar molecule .",
    "specifically , the external field stems from the rydberg electron and the rydberg core , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron charge , @xmath11 is the core - polar molecule separation vector and @xmath12 is the position of the rydberg electron with respect to the core . in other words , ( [ eq : h_mol ] ) describes the coupling between the internal state of the polar molecule and the rydberg atom .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ eq : h_mol ] ) only depends on the magnitude of the external field , which is appropriate for static , homogeneous fields . for a rigid rotor molecule , such as krb",
    ", the rotation of the molecule happens on much slower time scales than the rydberg electron orbital time . in this case , the coupling between the rydberg atom and the polar molecule accounts for the rotation of the molecule , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the rigid rotor dipole moment .",
    "this interaction leads to bo potential surfaces which depend on both @xmath11 and the orientation of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath11 ; this more complete treatment is the subject of an ongoing study .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath6 doublet molecule , such as oh , has a permanent dipole moment that arises from the interaction of two opposite parity electronic ( @xmath15 ) states .",
    "rotational transition energies in @xmath6-doublet molecules are usually orders of magnitude larger than the typical doublet splitting energies . for the fields provided by highly excited rydberg atoms , of order @xmath16 a.u .",
    ", our model hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_mol ] ) thus provides an excellent description of such molecules .    the electron - dipole interaction in ( [ eq : ed_inter ] ) and in the off - diagonal elements of ( [ eq : h_mol ] )",
    "has a critical value .",
    "if the dipole moment , @xmath7 , is larger than the fermi - teller critical value , @xmath17 d , an infinite number of bound states form @xcite . furthermore , an electron scattering off a super critical dipole ( @xmath18 ) is sensitive to the detailed , short - range structure of the polar molecule . to avoid the complication of super - critical dipole scattering and electron transfer from the rydberg atom to the polar molecule , we will deal exclusively with polar molecules whose dipole moments are subcritical , i.e. , @xmath19 d.",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the external electric field is along the intermolecular axis , such that ( [ eq : ryd_field ] ) becomes @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the projection @xmath22 of the rydberg electron angular momentum along @xmath11 is conserved . to find the bo potentials , we solve the adiabatic schrdinger equation at fixed polar molecule location @xmath23 , @xmath24 with @xmath25 the first term , @xmath26 , describes the unperturbed rydberg atom ; the core penetration , scattering , and polarization effects of its valence electron are accounted for by the @xmath27-dependent model potential @xmath28 @xcite , giving rise to the quantum defects of the low angular momentum rydberg states .",
    "@xmath29 is the electron mass , @xmath30 is the electron wave function , and @xmath31 is a coordinate signifying the internal states of the polar molecule .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath32 serve as the sought - after bo potentials for the polar perturber . to solve ( [ eq : adiab_se ] )",
    ", the total wave function is expanded in the basis @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an unperturbed rydberg orbital and @xmath35 are the polar molecule parity states .",
    "the atomic and molecular degrees of freedom are coupled by the electric field ( [ eq : zaxis_field ] ) that mixes both the rydberg orbitals as well as the parity states of the polar molecule , cf .",
    "( [ eq : h_mol ] ) .    in @xcite , the bo potentials were found using degenerate perturbation theory in the ( nearly ) degenerate set of rydberg orbitals @xmath36 .",
    "the molecular hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_mol ] ) can be prediagonalized to yield the eigenvalues @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the critical external field strength at which the molecule becomes completely polarized . inserting in ( [ eq : mol_evals ] ) for @xmath8 the @xmath39-dependent eigenstates of the rydberg atom exposed to the field ( [ eq : zaxis_field ] ) results in the potentials found in @xcite .",
    "a more complete treatment of the system requires that the total adiabatic hamiltonian is diagonalized in a complete set of rydberg orbitals .",
    "because in the latter case , the orbitals are in general not degenerate , the prediagonalization scheme can not be directly used beyond the degenerate perturbation theory .    in the present work ,",
    "we go beyond the degenerate perturbation theory framework adapted in @xcite . to this end",
