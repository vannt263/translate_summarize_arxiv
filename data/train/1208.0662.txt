    "theoretical predictions of high - energy scattering rely on the factorization of scattering cross sections , in which the hard , collinear and soft parts are separated to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "many inclusive cross sections have been proved to be factorized , and are used to compare with experiments .",
    "less inclusive scattering processes are also of interest .",
    "recently the transverse momentum distribution in the higgs , @xmath1 boson , and @xmath2 pair production has redrawn new interest both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . but in high - energy scattering processes with nonzero momentum transverse to the beam direction , the factorization proof becomes more involved .",
    "for example , in the higgs production with the transverse momentum @xmath3 with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the higgs mass , the scattering cross section involves unintegrated , or transverse - momentum - dependent parton distribution functions ( tmdpdfs ) .",
    "the study of the transverse momentum distribution was first heralded by ref .",
    "however , the factorization proof , which appears ubiquitously in high - energy processes including drell - yan process , has been recently under debate again .",
    "before we discuss many issues in proving factorization of the processes with transverse momentum , it is worth delineating why the drell - yan process with small transverse momentum is so intricate .",
    "when we consider radiative corrections in massless gauge theories , there appear ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) divergences .",
    "the uv and ir divergences should appear separately with no mixing in order for the theory to be consistent .",
    "in many inclusive processes , this was shown explicitly in the collinear and soft parts . in the process where the transverse momentum for a final - state particle is fixed ,",
    "the uv divergence to be obtained by integrating over the transverse momentum does not emerge yet .",
    "therefore the separation of the uv and ir divergences seems murky at first sight .",
    "furthermore , when the transverse momentum is fixed , there appears another type of divergence called rapidity divergence , or lightcone singularity .",
    "the issues in the drell - yan processes with small transverse momentum reside in the appropriate treatment of rapidity divergence and in finding an adequate formalism in which the separation of the uv and ir divergences is established .",
    "the first issue is the existence of rapidity divergence , which has been known for a long time @xcite , and various ways of handling it have been suggested .",
    "the source of the rapidity divergence can be understood by the following argument : in qcd , the kinoshita - lee - nauenberg theorem @xcite guarantees that the divergence in virtual corrections at a given order in the strong coupling @xmath6 is cancelled by the divergence in real gluon emissions , thus rendering inclusive scattering cross sections free of infrared divergence .",
    "the presence of infrared divergences can be traced by considering the kinematics in each case . in virtual corrections ,",
    "the loop momentum can be collinear to an energetic particle , or soft , which results in collinear or soft divergences , or it can be both collinear and soft . in real emissions , the emitted gluon can also be collinear to an energetic particle or soft , or both as long as the phase space allows it .",
    "these divergences cancel in inclusive processes , and the inclusive scattering cross sections are physically meaningful in the absence of the collinear and soft divergences .",
    "however , if we consider differential cross sections with fixed transverse momentum , this cancellation becomes incomplete .",
    "that is , when the transverse momentum of an emitted gluon is fixed , the phase space of the emitted gluon does not cover all the available phase space in virtual corrections , and the ir divergences do not cancel because of the imbalance of the phase space between real and virtual corrections .",
    "the presence of the infrared divergence due to this incomplete cancellation is referred to as the `` rapidity divergence '' or lightcone singularity since it is the result caused by the interaction of the energetic particle with collinear gluons with infinite rapidity .",
    "the dimensional regularization can not regulate the rapidity divergence .",
    "the difficulty in regulating the rapidity divergence was first noticed by collins @xcite .",
    "collins and soper @xcite suggested an intriguing idea of defining the operator whose matrix elements generate tmdpdf by tilting the wilson lines which connect the fermion fields to make the operator gauge invariant . in association with this tilting , they introduced an additional scale of which the tmdpdf should be independent , and the corresponding evolution equation was developed .",
    "this method , while effective in handling the rapidity divergence , has a nuisance .",
    "first , the dependence of the additional scale appears in the hard , collinear and soft parts , which troubles the factorization proof .",
    "though the dependence of the additional scale disappears when all the parts are summed , it is not clear how to approach the physical limit , that is , the limit in which all the particles are put on the lightcone .",
    "finally it is not straightforward to obtain the integrated pdf from the tmdpdf by integrating over the transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "chiu et al .",
    "@xcite developed the idea of rapidity renormalization to handle the rapidity divergence .",
    "in high - energy scattering , there are collinear particles and soft particles , and they note that particles with the same offshellness can be labeled as collinear or soft depending on their rapidities",
    ". therefore a rapidity scale is set up to distinguish collinear and soft particles .",
    "however , since the physics is independent of this arbitrary scale for the separation , the evolution equations of the collinear and the soft parts can be obtained with respect to the scaling of this rapidity scale .",
    "technically they modified collinear and soft wilson lines in such a way that wilson lines depend on the rapidity scale .",
    "the rapidity scale dependence of the wilson line is determined to satisfy the requirement that the cross section be independent of the rapidity scale , that is , the rapidity scale dependence of the collinear part is cancelled by that of the soft part . though the motivations come from different reasoning , the approaches of collins et al .",
    "@xcite and chiu et al .",
    "@xcite share in common the fact that they introduced an additional scale of which physical results should be independent .",
    "this is reflected in the evolution equations of the collinear and soft parts .",
    "the purpose of this approach is also focused to handle the rapidity divergence .    in this paper ,",
    "a straightforward way of regulating the rapidity divergence is presented in the framework of the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "the regularization for the rapidity divergence is achieved by introducing the @xmath0 regulator in the collinear wilson lines only and not in any other propagators .",
    "chiu et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the @xmath0 regulator , which is an infrared regulator inserted in every propagator , as well as in the wilson lines .",
    "they showed that the @xmath0 dependence of the collinear part in the back - to - back current is cancelled by the zero - bin subtraction .",
    "they stressed the importance of the proper zero - bin subtraction in the cancellation of the @xmath0 dependence .",
    "the @xmath0 regulators can be given as arbitrary parameters , or they can be related to the offshellness of the external particles . in either case , the @xmath0 dependence in the collinear and soft parts is different and can not be cancelled unless a specific relation is imposed .",
    "a simple relation can be found in a special case like a back - to - back current when the offshellness is employed to regulate divergences .",
    "however , when multijets are involved , @xmath0 depends on the offshellness of all the external particles in a complicated way .",
    "the collinear wilson line in the @xmath7 direction is obtained by considering the emission of @xmath7-collinear gluons from the other particles not in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "then the intermediate states become offshell , and the collinear wilson line is obtained by integrating out this offshellness , and taking the leading term .",
    "if a back - to - back current is involved only , the @xmath0 regulator can be related to the offshellness of the particle in the @xmath8 direction for the @xmath7-collinear wilson line .",
    "if we consider a process in which there are many jets , the offshellness in a collinear wilson line depends on all the other jets in the process . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath7-soft wilson line is obtained by considering soft gluon emissions from the @xmath7-collinear particle .",
    "therefore if the offshellness is included , the soft wilson line involves only the offshellness of the corresponding collinear particle . here the rapidity divergence is handled by inserting the @xmath0 regulator in the collinear wilson lines only .",
    "other regulators , though similar to the @xmath0 regulator in the collinear wilson lines in form , regulate ir divergences .    the second issue is to separate the remaining uv and ir divergences .",
    "the presence of the mixing between the uv and ir divergences is troublesome because the physics at a high scale and a low scale is mixed , which does not make sense .",
    "therefore the decoupling of the uv and ir divergences in loop calculations is essential to guarantee the consistency of the theory .",
    "in contrast to inclusive processes , the appropriate combination in which this decoupling occurs is still vague .",
    "it makes the definition of the tmdpdf itself controversial .",
    "the problem is whether the soft contribution or part of it should be included in the matrix element of the collinear operators which comprise the backbone of the tmdpdf .",
    "the underlying idea is to find a suitable combination of collinear and soft parts such that uv and ir divergences at higher orders are separated in order to prove factorization .",
    "a specific combination of collinear and soft parts has been claimed to achieve this separation @xcite .",
    "but once soft part is included in the tmdpdf , there follows another issue , the universality of the tmdpdf .",
    "the soft part interacts with all the different collinear sectors , and it is different for different final hadronic states",
    ". therefore the definition of the tmdpdf in one process may lose its meaning in other processes once the soft part in a specific process is included in the tmdpdf though the tmdpdfs in two different processes can be related to each other . this kind of relation for the pdf in deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan processes has been discussed when the soft part is included in the pdf @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an intriguing method to define the factorized tmdpdf was developed .",
    "first , the authors put all the particles on the lightcone , which is physical .",
    "therefore there is no need to introduce additional scales due to the tilting of wilson lines or rapidity separation .",
    "obviously a technique to handle the rapidity divergence is necessary , and the @xmath0 regulator , slightly different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite , is employed .",
    "they defined the tmdpdf in terms of the collinear part with the soft function , which is similar to the approach of collins @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath0 dependence , which indicates the presence of the rapidity divergence , is cancelled only through a specific combination of the collinear and soft parts as they claimed .",
    "it is based on the observation @xcite that the zero - bin contribution can be identified as the soft part .",
    "it is true for back - to - back currents to set up a relation of the regulators in the collinear and soft parts , but in general it does not hold .",
    "for example , if there are many jets or heavy colored particles in the process , there is no simple relation between them .    in this paper ,",
    "the tmdpdf is defined in terms of the collinear fields only , thus it is universal in all high - energy processes .",
    "all the particles are put on the lightcone and the rapidity divergence is handled by the @xmath0 regulator in the collinear wilson lines .",
    "the collinear part itself along with the corresponding zero - bin subtraction is independent of the @xmath0 regulator .",
    "the zero - bin contribution is performed in the limit where collinear particles become soft ( not ultrasoft ) to avoid double counting @xcite . the infrared divergence from the soft wilson lines",
    "is cancelled by that of the collinear part , which is controlled by the offshellness of the external particles . combining all the ingredients , we obtain a factorized form of the scattering cross section with small transverse momentum in drell - yan processes .",
    "the hard part is the wilson coefficients obtained in matching the current operators between qcd and scet .",
    "the collinear part consists of the tmdpdf , and the remaining part is the soft function . we develop a method to handle the rapidity divergence , with the decoupling of the uv and ir divergences , and show the result explicitly at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy .    the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ facdy ] , the factorized form of the scattering cross section in drell - yan process is presented . in section [ tmdpdf ] ,",
    "the tmdpdf is defined as the matrix elements of collinear fields , and the one - loop corrections are computed .",
    "the role of the zero - bin subtraction to avoid double counting is discussed and we argue that the soft zero - bin subtraction is the appropriate method for small transverse momentum @xmath9 . in section  [ softone ] ,",
    "the soft function is defined in terms of the soft wilson lines , and its one - loop correction is presented . the relation between the tmdpdf and the integrated pdf",
    "is discussed in section  [ comp ] , and we explain how the integrated pdf is obtained from the tmdpdf . in section  [ renor ] , the renormalization group behavior of the scattering cross section at nlo is presented . in section  [ decuvir ] , the decoupling of the uv and ir divergences is elucidated in detail . and finally in section  [ conc ] , we summarize the procedure for taming the rapidity divergence with the decoupling of the uv and ir divergences , and give a conclusion . in appendix ,",
    "the properties of the @xmath10 distribution and the infinity distribution are described .",
    "let us consider drell - yan process @xmath11 , where the lepton pair @xmath12 is produced with small transverse momentum @xmath3 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the invariant mass of the lepton pair @xmath14 is the large scale .",
    "the incoming particles are @xmath7-collinear and @xmath8-collinear , and their momenta scale as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the small parameter .",
    "we also denote @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "there are soft particles , whose momenta scale as @xmath19 , in the final state to balance the transverse momentum of the lepton pair . in scet ,",
    "the interactions between collinear and soft particles are not allowed since they put each particle far off their mass shells .",
    "therefore the soft part is decoupled and is expressed in terms of the soft wilson lines .",

    "@xcite treats the rapidity divergence in a similar way to ours , but they insert the @xmath0 regulators in both the collinear and the soft wilson lines and give a specific relation between the collinear and the soft regulators .",
    "that relation , as we point out , holds only for the back - to - back current .",
    "the separation of the uv and ir divergences is achieved in the sum of the virtual and real corrections in the collinear sector and in the soft sector , and in the sum of the collinear and soft parts in the virtual corrections and in the real gluon emissions . in effective theories like scet",
    ", the mixing shows up often in intermediate steps , but it cancels in the final result . in the radiative correction of the tmdpdf , it also holds in the sums mentioned above .",
    "therefore the renormalization group scaling can be considered only for the hard part and the sum of the collinear and soft parts .",
    "this prescription seems to violate the factorization in its strictest sense that the collinear and the soft parts are separately well defined .",
    "we rather claim that the attempt to combine the collinear part with part of the soft part such that the uv and ir divergences are decoupled is futile in its strictest sense that no such thing occurs with general regulators unless a very specific set of relations is imposed .",
    "the soft part interacts with all the collinear sectors in the process , hence contains the information of all the collinear sectors through their offshellness .",
    "therefore it is physically more reasonable to consider the scaling behavior of the sum of the collinear and soft parts in order to decouple the uv and ir divergences .",
    "this may sound cumbersome , since it means that we have to compute all the collinear and soft parts first in complicated processes with multijets or heavy colored particles .",
    "but we stress that it is the correct procedure to treat high - energy scattering",
    ". it will be interesting to see if our procedure also works in other processes involving small transverse momentum .",
    "various aspects of our formalism will be investigated in future publications .",
    "the important result in this work is the factorization formula for the differential scattering cross section in drell - yan process with small transverse momentum , given by eq .",
    "( [ vir ] ) .",
    "the scattering cross section is factorized into the hard part , the tmd kernel and the pdf s .",
    "the hard part is the matching coefficient between the full theory and the scet with the scale @xmath36 .",
    "the tmd kernel is obtained by matching the two scet s with the scales @xmath36 and @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the tmd kernel should be free from ir divergence to all orders , and it is shown explicitly at nlo .",
    "note that the tmd kernel @xmath219 is expressed in momentum space , rather than in impact parameter space . at least at nlo ,",
    "the anomalous dimension of @xmath69 is proportional to @xmath220 , hence the dependence of the scaling behavior on the transverse momentum is trivial .",
