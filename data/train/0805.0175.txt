    "<S> the antiferromagnetic transition is investigated in the rare - earth ( @xmath0 ) tritelluride @xmath0te@xmath1 family of charge density wave ( cdw ) compounds via specific heat , magnetization and resistivity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> observation of the opening of a superzone gap in the resistivity of dyte@xmath1 indicates that additional nesting of the reconstructed fermi surface in the cdw state plays an important role in determining the magnetic structure .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0te@xmath1 family of compounds ( @xmath0 = y , la - sm , gd - tm ) have generated recent interest as a model charge - density wave ( cdw ) system.@xcite the material is weakly orthorhombic ( space group cmcm ) and has a layered crystal structure comprising double layers of nominally square - planar te sheets separated by a corrugated @xmath0te layer.@xcite the relevant parts of the electronic structure are determined by the te planes , and the fermi surface ( fs ) consists of inner and outer diamond - shaped sheets , each doubled due to bilayer splitting , with minimal dispersion in the perpendicular ( @xmath2-axis ) direction.@xcite the lindhard susceptibility has a distinct peak structure for wave vectors close to 2/7 ( 5/7 ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the reduced ( extended ) zone scheme@xcite ( where e.g. @xmath3 = 2@xmath5 ) , and indeed all members of the family are found to suffer an incommensurate lattice modulation with wave vector very close to 2/7 @xmath4.@xcite angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) shows that sections of the original fs that are nested by this wave vector are gapped below the critical temperature @xmath6.@xcite the material remains metallic below @xmath6@xcite and the reconstructed fs can be probed via both arpes@xcite and de haas - van alphen measurements.@xcite @xmath6 is found to vary monotonically across the series , with the highest values for members of the family with the largest lattice parameter , this variation being principally ascribed to the effect of chemical pressure on the electronic structure.@xcite for the four compounds with the smallest lattice parameters ( @xmath0 = dy , ho , er , tm ) , remaining portions of the fermi surface are partially gapped again by a second cdw , which for erte@xmath1@xcite and hote@xmath1@xcite has been shown to have a wavevector @xmath7 1/3 @xmath3 , transverse to the first . </S>",
    "<S> this second transition occurs at a considerably lower temperature than the first , and follows the opposite trend with lattice parameter ( i.e. increases with increasing chemical pressure ) .    despite the growing interest in this family of compounds , to date the effect of cdw formation on the onset of long range magnetic order ( lrmo ) </S>",
    "<S> has not been considered , principally because the cdw was believed to form at a considerably higher temperature than the nel temperature @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> our recent observation of a second cdw which forms at a considerably lower temperature for the heaviest members of the rare earth series raises the very interesting question of how these two distinct ground states interact ( even compete ) when @xmath6 and @xmath8 are on a more level footing . </S>",
    "<S> this question motivates an initial survey of the magnetic properties of these materials , and specifically of the magnetic phase diagram , which is the subject of this brief report .     </S>",

    "<S> cdw formation is expected to affect the magnetic susceptibility by decreasing the density of states at the fermi level , resulting in a reduced pauli paramagnetism . in practice , this effect is all but obscured for the magnetic rare earths due to the larger curie susceptibility </S>",
    "<S> . however , the diamagnetic susceptibility of yte@xmath1 shows a clear downturn on cooling below @xmath6 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : yte3 ] ) .    as previously reported by iyeiri _ _ et al.__@xcite for a subset ( @xmath0 = ce , pr , nd , gd , dy ) of the series , the susceptibilities for the magnetic compounds follow curie - weiss behavior and are mildly anisotropic ( excepting gdte@xmath1 ) . </S>",

    "<S> both measurements clearly show three closely spaced phase transitions , with the small difference in peak positions between the heat capacity and susceptibility measurements ( 0.3 k ) ascribed to systematic errors in the thermometry .    the electrical resistivity for tbte@xmath1 is shown in fig  [ fig : tb_closeup](b ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : dysuperzone](b ) the @xmath2-axis resistivity shows a distinct _ upturn _ on cooling below the upper of the two transitions before dropping due to the loss of spin disorder scattering . </S>",
    "<S> data were collected for many crystals , with only slight differences in the shape of the feature . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is clear evidence for superzone gap formation , implying that the geometry of the reconstructed fs in the cdw state plays a significant role in determining the magnetic ordering wave vector . </S>",
    "<S> since the material has already suffered two cdw transitions , this constitutes a third wavevector gapping sections of the fs . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> since wavevectors spanning the fs are typically incommensurate with the underlying lattice , this would imply the presence of an incommensurate magnetic structure living in a structure that is _ already _ modulated by an incommensurate wavevector due to cdw formation . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : degennes](b ) , nel temperatures for the heavy members of the series ( r = gd , tb , dy , ho ) are plotted as a function of the in - plane lattice constant @xmath20 , together with the cdw transition temperatures @xmath21 and @xmath22.@xcite of particular relevance , we note that the lower cdw transition @xmath22 is rapidly suppressed as @xmath20 increases . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously argued that this effect is directly related to the amount of fs remaining after formation of the first cdw at @xmath21.@xcite significantly , @xmath22 is suppressed somewhere between dyte@xmath1 and tbte@xmath1 , raising the distinct possibility that by astute alloying the two order parameters ( separately associated with the lrmo and cdw ) might be forced to interact on a level playing field . </S>",
    "<S> since the fs plays a key role in establishing both the magnetic ordering in dyte@xmath1 and also the cdw formation - that is , since both effects compete for sections of the fs - it is likely that the phase diagrams for both order parameters will not evolve smoothly between the two end members . </S>",
    "<S> experiments to more closely follow the interaction between these two order parameters for alloys in this range are currently underway .    in summary , in this short paper we have established the outline of the magnetic phase diagram for the rare earth tritelluride family of compounds , in particular highlighting the region for which the onset of long range magnetic order and charge density wave formation occur in a closely spaced range of temperatures . the interplay between lrmo and cdw formation provides another facet to the emerging story of these prototypical cdw compounds . </S>"
