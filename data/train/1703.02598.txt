    "owing to its role as the carrier of genetic information , dna is of central importance in biology . in its interactions with other biomolecules within the cell ,",
    "dna is often bent and twisted .",
    "a good mechanical model of dna is therefore essential to understand the complex biological processes in which it is involved  @xcite .",
    "a large number of experiments in the past have shown that its mechanical response can be described using simple continuous polymer models , such as the twistable worm - like chain ( twlc ) , which treats dna as an elastic rod , exhibiting resistance to applied bending and twisting  @xcite . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", the twlc has proven to be surprisingly accurate in the description of the dna response to applied forces  @xcite and torques  @xcite .",
    "as experimental techniques become more accurate , physical models are put to increasingly strict tests .",
    "single - molecule experiments of the past few years have reported some discrepancies between the twlc predictions and the observed torsional response of dna @xcite .",
    "these experiments use magnetic tweezers in order to apply both a torque and a stretching force to a single dna molecule .",
    "the measured torsional stiffness as a function of the applied force turned out to deviate from the twlc predictions .",
    "a recent study explained these discrepancies using an elastic dna model , which extends the twlc by including a direct coupling term between the twisting and bending degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the existence of twist - bend coupling was predicted by marko and siggia  @xcite .",
    "quite surprisingly the consequence of this coupling on the structural and dynamical properties of dna has only been discussed in a very limited number of papers so far  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the elastic properties of oxdna , a coarse - grained model for simulations of single- and double - stranded dna  @xcite .",
    "oxdna comes in two versions : the original version ( oxdna1 ) contains symmetric grooves , while in a more recent extension ( oxdna2 ) distinct major and minor grooves were introduced  @xcite . by comparing the two versions , we deduce the effect of an asymmetric grooving on the elastic properties of the molecule .",
    "our analysis shows a clear signature of twist - bend coupling in oxdna2 , while this interaction is absent in the symmetric oxdna1 .",
    "this confirms the predictions of marko and siggia  @xcite and shows that the groove asymmetry strongly affects the elastic properties of the molecule .",
    "our estimate of the twist - bend coupling constant in oxdna2 is in agreement with that obtained from a recent analysis of magnetic tweezers data  @xcite .",
    "elastic polymer models describe double - stranded dna as a continuous inextensible rod . at every point along the molecule",
    "one defines a local frame of reference , given by a set of three orthonormal vectors @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the arc - length coordinate and @xmath4 the contour length . the common convention is to choose @xmath5 as local tangent to the curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : frame ] ) , whereas @xmath6 and @xmath7 lie in the plane of the ideal , planar watson - crick base pairs  @xcite .",
    "the vector @xmath6 is directed along the symmetry axis of the two grooves and @xmath7 is obtained from the relation @xmath8 . knowing how the set @xmath9 depends on @xmath10 allows one to reconstruct the conformation of the molecule .",
    "is the unit tangent vector , whereas @xmath11 is chosen to lie on the symmetry plane of the grooves .",
    "the third vector is given by @xmath12 . ]    any local deformation of the curve induces a rotation of the frame @xmath13 from @xmath10 to @xmath14 , which can be described by the following differential equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17  nm@xmath18 is the intrinsic twist of the dna double helix .",
    "the vector @xmath19 is parallel to the axis of rotation from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "note that in general @xmath22 depends on the coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "decomposing this vector along the local frame we define its three components as @xmath23 . the case @xmath24 and @xmath25 express bending in the planes defined by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the lowest - energy configuration of the system is that of zero mechanical stress @xmath26 , which corresponds to a straight rod with an intrinsic twist angle per unit length equal to @xmath27 . expanding around this ground state ,",
    "one obtains the elastic energy to lowest order in the deformation parameters @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the @xmath31 symmetric matrix @xmath32 , which we refer to as the stiffness matrix , contains the elastic constants .",

    "( [ eq : rotation ] ) the @xmath33 s have the dimension of inverse length . as the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_gen ] ) is dimensionless , the elements of the stiffness matrix have the dimension of length . in this work sequence - dependent effects",
    "will be neglected , therefore @xmath34 will not depend on  @xmath10 .",
    "marko and siggia argued that , due to the asymmetry introduced by the major and minor grooves , the elastic energy of dna should be invariant only under the transformation @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath36 is the only cross - term allowed by symmetry , therefore the stiffness matrix in the marko - siggia ( ms ) model becomes @xmath37                  0    & a_2 & g \\\\[4pt ]                  0    & g    & c                 \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "we investigate the elastic properties of oxdna , which is a model for coarse - grained computer simulations of both single- and double - stranded dna  @xcite .",
    "the model describes dna as a string of rigid nucleotides , with pairwise interactions modeling the backbone covalent bonds , the hydrogen bonding , the stacking , cross - stacking and excluded - volume interactions .",
    "oxdna has been used in the past for the study of a variety of dna properties  @xcite .",
    "we performed simulations using two available versions of the model .",
    "the first version ( oxdna1 ) describes dna as a molecule with no distinction between major and minor grooves  @xcite , while the second ( oxdna2 ) introduces distinct grooving asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : oxdna1_2 ] illustrates molecular conformations of the two models , including a cross - sectional view . as discussed above , the presence of distinct major and minor grooves breaks a molecular symmetry , so we expect that oxdna1 and oxdna2 will be mapped onto the twlc ( eq .  ( [ eq : energy_twlc ] ) ) and onto the ms model ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_ms ] ) ) , respectively .    to sample equilibrium fluctuations , molecular dynamics simulations in the nve ensemble with an anderson - like thermostat were used .",
    "this is implemented in repeated cycles in which the system is first evolved by integrating the newton equation of motions in time for a given number of steps .",
    "then the momenta of some randomly selected particles are chosen from a maxwell distribution with a desired simulation temperature ( @xmath52  k in our case ) .",
    "the cycle then repeats itself a large number of times .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations were performed on 150 basepair molecules using averaged base pair interaction coefficients . in all simulations",
    "the salt concentration was set to @xmath53 m .",
    "a total of @xmath54 timesteps were sampled using a numerical integration time step of @xmath55 fs and the trajectories were recorded every @xmath56 time steps .",
    "the pivotal objective of the extraction of elastic parameters is to map oxdna onto the described elastic model in such a way , that both the elastic properties at the base pair level as well as long range behavior , such as bending and torsional persistence lengths , are captured as accurately as possible .",
    "establishing an appropriate one - to - one correspondence requires the reduction of both models to the same level of complexity . for the continuous elastic model",
    "this implies the discretization of the elastic free energy function eq .",

    "therefore an appropriate triad has to be assigned to each base - pair of the oxdna model , which contains a certain degree of ambiguity , resulting in different mappings for different triads .",
    "such an ambiguity regarding the definition of the tangent vector @xmath5 in coarse - grained simulations of dna and the related implications for the extraction of the bending persistence length have for instance been discussed by fathizadeh et al .",
    ",  @xcite who showed that , when considering short length scales , different definitions of the local tangent vector will usually yield significantly different results for the bending persistence length .",
    "however , when considering longer length scales , i.e.  comparing more distant tangent vectors , those discrepancies vanish asymptotically.for a detailed discussion of different triad definitions we refer to the supporting information .",
    "all results presented in the main text are calculated with a triad definition employing local tangents @xmath5 obtained from the mean vector of the intrinsic orientation of the two nucleotides in each basepair , provided by the oxdna output .",
    "the unit vector @xmath7 is obtained from the projection of the connecting vector between the centers of the two nucleotides @xmath62 , onto the orthogonal space of @xmath5 .",
    "having identified @xmath5 and @xmath7 we defined @xmath63 .        in order to infer the stiffness matrix from simulations , we used the standard procedure ( see e.g.  ref .  ) which relies on the equipartition theorem  @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 indicates the thermal average .",
    "we introduce next the @xmath66 covariance matrix with elements @xmath67 where we have dropped the index @xmath60 from @xmath68 , as we neglect sequence - dependent effects . combining ( [ eq : elastic_energy_discrete ] ) and ( [ eq : ept ] )",
    "we get @xmath69 thus , the stiffness parameters contained in @xmath34 can be extracted from the correlation matrix @xmath70 , obtained from equilibrium fluctuations ( eq .  ( [ def_lambda ] ) ) .",

    "although this prediction is more than 20 years old , twist - bend coupling has received little attention in the dna literature .",
    "the standard polymer model currently used to describe dna elasticity remains the twlc , which is characterized by a diagonal stiffness matrix ( eq .

    "this wide range of values has a natural explanation within the ms model  @xcite .",
    "the above measurements can be subdivided in two groups . in a first group",
    "one can set all techniques which sample freely fluctuating dna for which the ms model predicts @xmath102  nm . typical experiments on unstretched dna yield indeed torsional stiffness values around @xmath103  nm . in a second group",
    "one can place all techniques which measure dna under applied force . at sufficiently high force ,",
    "bending fluctuations are suppressed ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 are small ) therefore one expects to measure pure twist deformations , which are governed by a stiffness @xmath106  nm .",
    "this is indeed in agreement with magnetic tweezers data .",
    "the conclusion is that the ms model can account for the wide range of the torsional stiffness measurements .    having shown that the twist - bend coupling is a relevant interaction in dna",
    ", one can ask in which limits and for which quantities the twlc can still be considered a good approximated dna model .",
    "our work shows that one can map freely fluctuating dna onto a twlc using @xmath107  nm as twist elastic parameter , which incorporates the effect of twist - bend coupling .",
    "however some care needs to be taken in the presence of a stretching force , as the suppression of bending fluctuation will influence the twist stiffness . at high forces dna will then be mapped onto an effective twlc with a higher value of @xmath46 .",
    "finally , it will be important to investigate the effect of twist - bend coupling in cases where dna behavior is influenced by its mechanics as in dna supercoiling  @xcite or in dna - protein interactions  @xcite .",

    "this document contains additional information and results in support of the main manuscript .        in order to describe any local deformations of an inextensible , elastic rod , onto which dna can be mapped ,",
    "one has to introduce a local frame of reference @xmath108 ( triad ) to every point along the rod .",
    "the deformations can be , thus , determined from the rotation of one triad into the next one . in the case of a continuous chain ,",
    "the following differential equation will hold @xmath109 and this frame of reference can be unambiguously defined : @xmath5 may be taken to be the tangent to the curve , @xmath6 pointing along the symmetry axis of the two grooves ( oriented towards the major groove ) and @xmath7 simply given by @xmath12 .        in the discrete case of oxdna , different triads can be defined using the few reference points provided by the coarse - grained model . in particular ,",
