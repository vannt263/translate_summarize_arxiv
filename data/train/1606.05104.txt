    "the effect of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) on strongly correlated electron systems has demonstrated to be the origin of novel phases @xcite , like spin liquids @xcite , unconventional magnetism @xcite , and topological phases @xcite , among others .",
    "also , it has been demonstrated that for an intermediate strength regime , soc can work together with coulomb interactions to enhance the electron correlations , leading to spin - orbit driven mott insulators @xcite .",
    "the key point is that small changes in these interactions can lead to an enormous variety in the electronic and magnetic behaviors . specifically in @xmath12 transition metals like ir",
    "the soc is significant , and comparable to the atomic interactions like crystal electric field @xmath13 and the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath14 .",
    "examples for this scenario are the pyrochlore iridates , which show novel phases like weyl semimetals @xcite , topological mott insulators @xcite , and axion insulators with unusual electromagnetic responses @xcite .",
    "the most common oxidation states of iridium are 3 + and 4 + . on the other hand oxidation states of 5",
    "+ and 6 + are rare and sometimes poorly characterized @xcite .",

    "is expected for double perovskites with ir@xmath2 ( 5d@xmath3 ) as the formal oxidation state .",

    "@xcite reports that a strong non - cubic crystal field ( due to the flattening of the iro@xmath1 octahedra ) together with an `` intermediate - strength '' spin - orbit coupling , leads to a different ground - state configuration , i.e. an antiferromagnetic ground state witht@xmath23 = 1.3 k. the emergence of magnetic ordering was evidenced in magnetization studies at 7 t as well as in specific heat measurements in different applied magnetic fields . for the latter characterization ,",

    "@xcite , a total entropy @xmath103 j / mol k is expected , which is evidently far from the experimental observations . nevertheless ,",

    "overall , our magnetic and thermodynamic characterization is consistent with a non - magnetic ground state of sr@xmath0yiro@xmath1 with the presence of a small amount of correlated @xmath106 paramagnetic centers . from our results , it is clear that the low temperature specific heat anomalies are not related with the onset of long - range magnetic order .",

    "k a low percentage of @xmath72 impurities were identified as the source for the observed paramagnetism .",
    "no long - range magnetic ordering was observed down to 430  mk .",
    "a thorough study of the specific heat was carried out , in which a broad anomaly in the low temperature region t @xmath77 5 k was identified as a schottky anomaly caused by paramagnetic impurities present in the sample , which are of the same order of magnitude ( @xmath109 % ) as obtained from magnetization measurements .",
