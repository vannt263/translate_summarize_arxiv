    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental gauge theory of the strong interaction based on quarks and gluons .",
    "there are a variety of nonperturbative phenomena in low energy qcd such as color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "these nonperturbative phenomena have been much studied @xcite , however , there are still open problems in qcd . in particular , it is thought that the confinement mechanism , how quarks and gluons are confined , is a considerably difficult problem .",
    "nowadays , there are several confinement scenarios in various gauges . in the landau gauge",
    ", confinement is related to the ( deep ) infrared behavior of the gluon propagator and the ghost propagator from the scenarios suggested by kugo and ojima , gribov and zwanziger @xcite .",
    "these propagators have been much studied from the analytical frameworks such as schwinger - dyson equations @xcite and functional renormalization group equations @xcite and lattice qcd calculations @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge has mainly been investigated from the viewpoint of the dual - superconductor picture @xcite , which is one of confinement scenarios suggested by nambu , t hooft and mandelstam @xcite .",
    "this picture is based on the electromagnetic duality and the analogy with the one - dimensional squeezing of the magnetic flux in the type - ii superconductor . in this picture",
    ", there occurs color magnetic monopole condensation , and then the color - electric flux between the quark and the antiquark is squeezed as a one - dimensional tube due to the dual higgs mechanism . from the viewpoint of the dual - superconductor picture in qcd , however , there are two assumptions of abelian dominance @xcite and monopole condensation . here",
    ", abelian dominance means that only the diagonal gluon component plays the dominant role for the nonperturbative qcd phenomena like confinement .",
    "the various lattice qcd monte carlo simulations show that the ma gauge fixing seems to support these assumptions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the diagonal gluons seem to be significant to the infrared qcd physics , which is called  infrared abelian dominance \" .",
    "thus the difference between the diagonal gluon propagator and the off - diagonal gluon propagator in the infrared region seems to be significant .    from this viewpoint",
    ", the gluon propagators in the ma gauge have been investigated in su(2 ) lattice simulations @xcite and in the su(3 ) lattice simulation @xcite . from these lattice simulations the off - diagonal gluons",
    "do not propagate in the infrared region due to the large effective mass @xmath13 , while the diagonal gluon widely propagates .",
    "in addition , the study of schwinger - dyson equations also supports the infrared abelian dominance from the behavior of the scaling solutions , i.e. , as momentum goes to zero , the diagonal gluon propagator is divergent and the off - diagonal gluon propagator is vanishing @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the gluon propagators in the ma gauge of su(3 ) lattice gauge theory . in sec.[2 ] , we briefly summarize the definition of ma gauge with u(1)@xmath14u(1)@xmath1 and some properties of lattice gluon propagators in this gauge . in sec.[3 ] , we show the method of estimating the effective mass in coordinate space and in momentum space .",
