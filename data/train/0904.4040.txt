    "gamow vectors and resonances , introduced by gamow to describe @xmath6-decay ( cf .",

    "the equation becomes    @xmath19    ( where `` - '' corresponds to the delta potential well and `` + '' corresponds to the barrier ) we shall focus on the delta potential well and analyze in detail the behavior of the wave function as well as the resonances of the system for all amplitudes and frequencies .",
