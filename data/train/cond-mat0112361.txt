    "recently , complex systems have received considerable attention as an interdisciplinary subject@xcite .",
    "complex systems consist of many constituents such as individuals , substrates , and companies in social , biological , and economic systems , respectively , showing cooperative phenomena between constituents through diverse interactions and adaptations to the pattern they create@xcite .",
    "recently , there have been a lot of efforts to understand such complex systems in terms of networks , composed of vertices and edges , where vertices ( edges ) represent constituents ( their interactions ) .",
    "this approach was initiated by erds and rnyi ( er)@xcite . in the er model , the number of vertices is fixed , while edges connecting one vertex to another occur randomly with a certain probability . however , the er model is too random to describe real complex systems .",
    "recently , barabsi and albert ( ba)@xcite introduced an evolving network where the number of vertices @xmath8 increases linearly with time rather than fixed , and a newly born vertex is connected to already existing vertices , following the so - called preferential attachment ( pa ) rule ; when the number of edges @xmath10 incident upon a vertex is called the degree of the vertex , the pa rule means that the probability @xmath11 for the new vertex to connect to an already existing vertex @xmath12 is proportional to the degree @xmath13 of the selected vertex , that is , @xmath14 the main difference between the er and ba models appears in the degree distribution . for the er network ,",
    "the degree distribution follows the poisson distribution , while for the ba network , it follows a power - law , @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the network whose degree distribution follows a power - law is called the scale - free ( sf ) network@xcite .",
    "sf networks are abundant in real - world such as the world - wide web@xcite , the internet @xcite , the citation network@xcite , the author collaboration network of scientific papers@xcite , and the metabolic networks in biological organisms@xcite . +",
    "while a lot of models have been introduced to describe sf networks in real world , most of them are stochastic models .",
    "however , a couple of models recently introduced by barabsi , ravasz and vicsek ( brv)@xcite , and dorogovtsev and mendes ( dm)@xcite are deterministic . in general ,",
    "the deterministic model is useful in investigating analytically not only topological features of sf networks in detail , but also dynamical problems on the networks .",
    "both the brv and the dm models are meaningful since they are not only the first attempts for deterministic sf networks , but also the ones constructed in a hierarchical way , so that analytic treatments can be made easily using recursive relations derived from two structures in successive generations . in the brv model , however , the mean shortest - path distance between two vertices , called the diameter , is independent of system size .",
    "thus , the model may be relevant to some specific systems such as the metabolic network@xcite , where the diameter is independent of system size . in this paper",
    ", we introduce another type of the deterministic model for the sf network , which is also constructed in a hierarchical way .",
    "our model is based on almost the same idea as that of the dm model .",
    "while the dm model starts from a triangle , our model does from a tree structure .",
    "this difference makes one easily modify the model into more general cases such as loopless or loop structures , and the ones with a various number of branches .",
    "moreover , the simplicity of our model enables us to obtain the analytic solution for the degree distribution and the diameter .",
    "in particular , our model includes a control parameter , so that by tuning the parameter , we can obtain sf networks with a variety of degree exponents in the range , @xmath17 .",
    "therefore our model should be useful to represent various sf networks in real world .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will introduce deterministic models specifically for tree and loop structures , respectively . in section iii",
    ", analytic treatment will be performed for the deterministic models introduced in section ii .",
    "the final section will be devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "it is known that the number of vertices in most of sf networks in real world increases exponentially in time .",
    "thus , our deterministic model is constructed in an evolving way , where each already existing vertex produces its offsprings , and the connections are made between old and new vertices .",
    "thus , vertices are generated in a hierarchical order , so that the number of vertices increases geometrically in time .",
    "on the other hand , it is known @xcite that the pa probability @xmath18 , eq.([pa ] ) is generalized for real networks as @xmath19 where @xmath20 accounts for some randomness in connecting edges . to take into account of this modified pa behavior ,",
    "we introduce two rules , called the addition and the multiplication rule , in the deterministic model , depending on how new vertices are generated from each old vertex .",
    "the details on both rules will be described below .",
    "the network forms a tree structure when new vertices generated from an old vertex are connected to their parent only .      in the case of the addition rule , at each time step , a constant number of new vertices , say @xmath21 new vertices , are generated from each already existing vertex , and they are connected to their parent only",
    ". then the degree @xmath22 at vertex @xmath12 , where the subscript @xmath23 means the addition rule , evolves as @xmath24 so that @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 means the time when the vertex @xmath12 was born .",
    "then the total number of vertices newly born at time @xmath28 becomes @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and the total number of vertices @xmath31 present at time @xmath28 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is chosen .",
    "the definition of this model is illustrated schematically in fig.1 .      in the case of the multiplication rule ,",
    "the number of offsprings generated from each old vertex is not the same , but it depends on the degree of each vertex . let @xmath34 be the degree of vertex @xmath12 at time @xmath28 , where the subscript @xmath4 means the multiplication rule . then the number of offsprings generated at time @xmath35 from the vertex @xmath12 is proportional to its degree at the previous time , i.e. , @xmath36 , where @xmath1 is a proportionality constant . thus the degree of vertex @xmath12 increases by a factor @xmath4 for each time step , that is , @xmath37 thus , the degree of vertex @xmath12 at time @xmath28 is @xmath38 for @xmath26 . the total number of vertices newly born at time @xmath28",
    ", @xmath39 can be obtained to be @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the total number of vertices @xmath42 at time @xmath28 is given by @xmath43 the definition of this model is illustrated schematically in fig.2 .",
    "one may write the rate equation for the degree in this multiplicative process with continuous time as @xmath44 it would be interesting to compare this rate equation with the one for the preferential attachment ( pa ) , in which the degree @xmath13 of vertex @xmath12 evolves as @xmath45 where @xmath46 means the total number of edges newly introduced at time @xmath28 .",
    "since the total number of the degree at time @xmath28 is given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 is given by eq.([lmt ] ) , eq.([rate_degree ] ) is reduced to eq.([m_rate ] ) , indicating that the rate equation for the degree in the multiplicative process is equivalent to the one for the preferential attachment .",
    "the loop structure can be formed in networks , when a newly born vertex is connected to more than one existing vertices .",
    "for the loop structure , each already existing vertex generates the same number of offsprings as those for the tree structure .",
    "however , a newly born vertex is connected to two distinct old vertices : one is its parent , and the other is its grandparent . when the parent is one of vertices on @xmath4 branches ( the centered one ) born at @xmath49 , the centered one ( one of vertices on @xmath4 branches in a symmetrical way ) is regarded as a grandparent .",
    "this rule is valid for both cases of the addition rule and the multiplication rule .",
    "the details on the connection rule is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "since the degree of a vertex has been obtained explicitly as in eqs.([kia ] ) and ( [ discrete ] ) and they are ordered with time , we can obtain the degree distribution using the relation , @xmath50}{\\partial k } , \\label{rel}\\ ] ] which is valid for both cases of the addition and the multiplication rules .",
    "the detail of analytic treatments for the degree distributions for both cases are given as follows .",
    "using the fact , @xmath51 , where the subscript @xmath28 means the tree structure , we obtain that @xmath52 applying eq.([rel ] ) to eq.([accm_a ] ) , we obtain the degree distribution to be @xmath53 so , the degree distribution @xmath54 in the addition rule decays exponentially with @xmath10 .      since the degree",
    "@xmath13 has been obtained explicitly as a function of time in eq.([discrete ] ) , @xmath55 is written as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 . since @xmath58 means the density of the vertices born earlier than @xmath59 , @xmath60 thus the degree distribution",
    "is obtained to be @xmath61 } { \\partial k}\\nonumber \\\\         & \\propto & k^{-\\gamma(m)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 in the limit of @xmath63 , we get @xmath64 , while as @xmath4 goes to infinity , we get @xmath65 . thus by tuning the parameter @xmath4 , we can get a variety of sf networks with different exponents in the range , @xmath17",
    ". +        let @xmath66 be the degree of vertex @xmath12 at time @xmath28 for the loop structure , where @xmath23 means the addition rule .",
    "each old vertex receives edges from its @xmath21 children and @xmath67 grandchildren as they are born .",
    "so , eq.([a_rate ] ) is modified as @xmath68 thus , the degree distribution shows an exponential - decay behavior , @xmath69 where the subscript @xmath70 means the loop structure .",
    "let @xmath71 be the degree of vertex @xmath12 at time @xmath28 in the multiplication rule for the loop structure .",
    "the degree of vertex @xmath12 can be obtained , @xmath72 where the second term on the right hand side of the above equation results from the children of the vertex @xmath12 , and the third term from the grandchildren of the vertex @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the degree at the vertex @xmath12 becomes @xmath73 since the degree @xmath71 depends on time @xmath28 similarly to eq.([discrete ] ) , we can apply eq.([tree_pk ] ) even to the loop case , except that @xmath59 is replaced by @xmath74 .",
    "this replacement , however , does not affect the degree exponent at all .",
    "thus , even for the loop structure , the degree exponent is reduced to the same value , @xmath75 in eq.([gamma ] ) .",
    "the diameter @xmath76 is defined as a geodesic distance between two distinct vertices along the shortest path averaged over all pairs of vertices at time @xmath28 , that is , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the shortest - path distance between vertex @xmath12 to @xmath79 . for simplicity ,",
    "let @xmath80 denote the sum of the shortest - path distances between two vertices over all pairs , that is , @xmath81 it is not easy to obtain a closed formula for @xmath82 for both the tree and the loop structure , however , we list @xmath82 for the tree structure in a few early times in appendix .",
    "we trace the formula for the tree structure in two limiting cases , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , as follows .",
    "+ let us first consider the case of @xmath63 . for this case , we denote @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the total number of nodes @xmath87 at time @xmath28 is given by @xmath88 moreover , the sum of all shortest - path distances @xmath82 becomes @xmath89 using the relation eqs.([dia ] ) , we can obtain the average distance to be @xmath90 therefore , the diameter converges to @xmath91 in the limit of @xmath92 . + next , we consider the case of @xmath84 . in this case , the term in the highest order of @xmath4 could be dominant , so that we trace the coefficient of the term in the highest order of @xmath4 as a function of time .",
    "@xmath93m^4 + \\mathrm{lower~order~terms } \\nonumber \\\\ { { \\cal { d}}}(2)&= & [ ( 2 + 2\\cdot 3 + 4)+2\\cdot ( 3 + 2\\cdot 4 + 5 ) + ( 4 + 2\\cdot 5 + 6)]m^6                \\nonumber \\\\             & & + \\mathrm{lower~order~terms } \\nonumber \\\\ { { \\cal { d}}}(3)&= & [ ( 2 + 3\\cdot 3 + 3\\cdot 4 + 5)+3(3 + 3\\cdot 4 + 3\\cdot 5 + 6 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & 3(4 + 3\\cdot 5 + 3\\cdot 6 + 7)+(5 + 3\\cdot 6 + 3\\cdot 7 + 8)]m^8 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\mathrm{lower~order~terms } \\nonumber \\\\       & & \\vdots \\nonumber \\\\ { { \\cal { d}}}(t ) & = & \\sum_{p=0}^{t}{t\\choose p}\\sum_{k=0}^{t}{t\\choose k }                ( k+p+2)m^{2(t+1 ) } \\nonumber \\\\             & & + \\mathrm{lower~order~terms}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the term in the highest order of @xmath4 for @xmath94 is obtained explicitly to be @xmath95 where the coefficient @xmath96 means the number of pathways having the distance @xmath97 , which is the farthest one at time @xmath28 in the system .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath98 therefore , the diameter @xmath76 at time @xmath28 becomes simply @xmath99 thus , for large @xmath8 , the above equation is rewritten simply as @xmath100 with the mean degree @xmath101 , which confirms the small - world behavior .",
    "we have introduced a deterministic model for the scale - free network , which is constructed in a hierarchical way . at each time step , each already existing vertex produces its offsprings , whose number is proportional to the degree of the vertex . depending on whether each offspring is connected to only one or more than one old vertices , the network forms either a tree structure or a loop structure , respectively .",
    "we have obtained the analytic solution for the degree distribution and the diameter explicitly for the deterministic model . by tuning a control parameter in the model",
    ", we can adjust the degree exponent in the range , @xmath17 .",
    "thus this model can represent a variety of sf networks in real world .",
    "moreover , we obtained the diameter of the deterministic model analytically to be @xmath102 , where @xmath8 is the system size and @xmath9 is the mean degree . since the network is generated in a hierarchical way , it is expected that a variety of physical problems can be solved through this deterministic model by constructing recursive relations derived from two structures in successive generations . on the other hand ,",
    "the deterministic model has a shortcoming that it does not include any long - ranged edge , connecting two vertices belonging to different branches separated at @xmath49 .",
    "thus , while this model can be easily generalized by controlling the number of branches @xmath4 , it is extremely vulnerable , and can be broken into pieces by a simple deletion of the centered vertex . despite this shortcoming",
    ", we think that our deterministic model could offer a guide toward generating more realistic deterministic model for sf networks .",
