    "the simulational investigation of elasto - plastic steady states in amorphous solids concentrated in recent years on athermal and quasi - static conditions ( aqs ) @xcite .",
    "the reasons for this are manifold : first , in athermal conditions the separation between elastic regimes and plastic events is clear cut .",
    "second , the mechanism for plastic events is purely mechanical , and it can be understood entirely on the basis of the underlying inter - particle potentials and dynamics @xcite .",
    "third , the simulations exhibit the existence of fascinating , highly correlated plastic events whose statistics abound with anomalous exponents that are not fully understood . on the other hand ,",
    "current models of elasto - plasticity tend to propose mean - field type theories in which plastic events are uncorrelated and are not linked to mechanical instabilities , but are rather assumed to be triggered by purely thermal fluctuations @xcite . if so , the interesting findings in the aqs regime might be entirely irrelevant for  normal plasticity \" at higher temperatures and strain rates .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine this issue with some care . to this purpose",
    "we will explore here the effect of temperature and of strain rates , separately and together , to assess whether indeed the existence of finite temperatures and strain rates obliterate the relevance of the rich plethora of findings at the aqs conditions .",
    "our conclusion is that this is far from being true @xcite .",
    "in fact , even when temperature or strain rates are enough to make the stress and energy fluctuations ` normal ' ( in a sense made precise below ) the role of mechanical instabilities is still crucial . we thus need to reveal the mechanisms responsible for the cross - over in statistics and to propose a theoretical framework for the discussion of the statistical physics of elasto - plastic steady state taking into account all the essential ingredients .",
    "when done , as described below in this paper , we will own a description that unifies the statistical physics below and above the crossovers from highly correlated to uncorrelated stress and energy fluctuations .",

    "we also understand the meaning of the cross - over due to thermal effects : the thermal agitation reaches just the necessary level to compete with the stored elastic energy per particle .",
    "the avalanches are made of the primary plastic instability triggering all the other , close to instability regions , to flip in tandem and relax .",
    "these ripe regions which are sufficiently close to instability to react to the primary instability , are all destroyed by the thermal fluctuations such that the primary instability remains naked , turning the statistics of the plastic events from anomalous to normal .",
    "this picture can be demonstrated directly by measuring the energy drop in a plastic event in quasi - static conditions but at different temperatures .",
    "the measurement is done by stopping the thermal molecular dynamics simulation , followed by quenching the system to a very low temperature of @xmath140 on a time scale of 100@xmath141 .",
    "this procedure allows for the completion of any plastic activity .",
    "then the potential energy is minimized and the aqs scheme is employed to measure the energy drop in the first upcoming mechanical instability .",
