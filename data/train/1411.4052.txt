    "the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) method uses the imprint of sound waves in the early universe on the clustering of galaxies today as a sensitive probe of the universe s expansion history ( see weinberg et al .",
    "2013 for a recent review ) .",
    "this in turn constrains the dark energy equation of state , which offers insight into dark energy s fundamental nature ( albrecht et al .",

    "2009 ; gott & slepian 2011 ; de boni et al . 2011 ; chiba et al . 2013 ; slepian et al .",
    "the bao method s accuracy depends on precisely modeling how the sound waves frozen in at high redshift imprint on galaxy clustering today , and hence how baryons and dm combine to form these galaxies .",
    "a potentially important effect on early generations of galaxies is the supersonic relative velocity between baryons and dm at decoupling ( @xmath1 , recently presented by tseliakhovich & hirata ( 2010 )",
    ". the relative velocity is sourced by the difference in the behavior of baryons and dark matter before decoupling . prior to decoupling ,",
    "the baryons and photons form a tightly coupled fluid , locked together by thomson scattering ( linking electrons to photons ) and the coulomb force ( linking protons to electrons ) .",
    "this fluid undergoes acoustic oscillations , or sound waves , that propagate to roughly 150 mpc comoving before halting as electron - photon scattering drops precipitously and decoupling occurs ( peebles & yu 1970 ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ; bond & efstathiou 1984 , 1987 ; holtzmann 1989 ; hu & sugiyama 1996 ; eisenstein & hu 1998 ) .",
    "the scale at which these waves halt is termed the sound horizon .    given an isolated overdense region , baryons nearer to it than the sound horizon are kept in rough hydrostatic equilibrium by the radiation pressure and so do not infall .",
    "in contrast , baryons more distant than the sound horizon fall towards the overdensity . meanwhile , dm on _ all _ scales infalls gravitationally .",
    "consequently , the baryons and dm differ in behavior below the sound horizon , resulting in a relative velocity at decoupling on these scales .",
    "it is believed that the relative velocity can modulate the formation of the first galaxies in the universe on scales similar to the sound horizon ( we describe this more below ) .",
    "since these galaxies are the progenitors of those we observe today , galaxy clustering today may retain a memory of this effect .",
    "yoo et al . ( 2011 ) analyze how such a memory might cause a shift in the galaxy - galaxy correlation function by which the sound horizon scale today is measured , an idea also hinted at in tseliakhovich & hirata 2010 and dalal et al .",
    "given the high precision of current and impending bao surveys such as boss , even a modest , order @xmath2 systematic source of error could significantly bias the inferred cosmological parameters .",
    "therefore it is essential to understand how the relative velocity can induce this shift and how , if the shift is indeed present , it can be corrected . while yoo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) state that the correlation function can shift , their analysis presents results in fourier space , showing the power spectrum and , importantly , finding that the bispectrum can be used to remove the relative velocity effect from the power spectrum .    here , we focus on configuration space , for several reasons",
    ". first , complicated behavior in the power spectrum and bispectrum often has a simple interpretation in configuration space ( bashinsky & bertschinger 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "our work shows that the relative velocity is indeed simple in configuration space : it is non - zero only within the sound horizon .",
    "our work therefore makes it clear that any effect on the correlation function is primarily on sub - horizon scales .",
    "it is adding or subtracting from the correlation function only inward of the bao peak that shifts the peak in or out in scale .",
    "our configuration space approach also offers the new result that , for extracting the relative velocity from the three - point galaxy correlation function ( 3pcf ) , legendre polynomials are an excellent angular basis ( szapudi 2004 and pan & szapudi 2005 first suggested such a basis for general measurements of the bispectrum ) . because the relative velocity has compact support in configuration space , we can additionally integrate over one side - length of the triangles entering the 3pcf for lengths where the relative velocity has support .",
    "this produces a novel compression scheme that improves the chances for detecting the relative velocity in the 3pcf while easing the computational demands of such an effort .",
    "indeed , this compression scheme is not the only practical advantage of a configuration space approach .",
    "the bispectrum is challenging to measure accurately on a cut sky , because survey boundaries break the translational symmetry implicit in a fourier decomposition .",
    "they also impose some miminum wavenumber below which the fourier representation is truncated , leading to gibbs phenomenon ringing in the bispectrum .",
    "in contrast , in configuration space , the 3pcf can be measured straightforwardly and cut - sky effects corrected by use of an estimator ( see e.g. kayo et al .",
    "2004 ; szapudi 2004 ; szapudi and szalay 1998 ) , though at some computational cost ( mcbride et al . 2011",
    "; marin et al . 2013 ) .",
    "indeed , pan and szapudi ( 2005 ) have already measured the monopole moment of the 3pcf in two - degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , showing the feasibility of this approach .    in the remainder of the introduction , we give greater detail on the physical mechanisms by which the relative velocity may affect galaxy clustering today : how does the relative velocity effect the first galaxies to form , and how might galaxies today retain a memory of these distant progenitors ? the relative velocity affects the formation of early , low - mass haloes , but precisely how remains an open question . in their initial paper presenting the relative velocity ,",
    "tseliakhovich & hirata ( 2010 ) predict suppression of halos with @xmath3 due to the relative velocity .",
    "naoz et al .",
    "( 2012 ) find this in simulations as well , though simulations by richardson et al .",
    "( 2013 ) find only a small effect in halo number density by @xmath4 . in those halos that do form ,",
    "the gas content is lowered ( dalal et al .",
    "2010 ; tseliakhovich et al . 2011 ; fialkov et al .",
    "2012 ; naoz et al .",
    "2013 ) . in simulations ,",
    "maio et al . (",
    "2011 ) find that star formation in low mass halos is suppressed , though stacy et al .",
    "( 2011 ) argue that the later - time star formation is not strongly affected .",
    "the minimum cooling mass for star formation via molecular hydrogen lines also may be raised in simulations ( greif et al . 2011 , though stacy et al.s earlier work argues it is not ) .",
    "oleary and mcquinn ( 2012 ) simulate structure formation to show that the relative velocity has a substantial effect on the first mini - halos accretion history .",
    "barkana ( 2013 ) points out that there may be additional dynamical effects , such as asymmetric disruption of accreting gas filaments and formation of supersonic wakes by halos moving in regions of high relative velocity .",
    "bovy & dvorkin ( 2013 ) suggest that for reasons such as these , star formation in small dm halos may be suppressed enough to resolve the over - prediction of small halos in @xmath5 simulations .",
    "it is believed that the modulation of early , low - mass halos by the relative velocity as discussed above will affect the subsequent formation of the higher - mass halos we observe today , perhaps through feedback channels such as altering the metal abundance or supernovae rate ( yoo et al . 2011 ) .",
    "since these links are not known in detail , it is simply assumed that the relative velocity biases the galaxy overdensity with some amplitude @xmath6 , to be fit from the data .",
    "this will be our approach here as well .",
    "finally , numerous studies have also developed rich small - scale consequences of the relative velocity , though that will not be our focus here . to give only a few examples , naoz & narayan ( 2013 ) show that the relative velocity modifies the biermann battery picture of magnetogenesis , while tanaka et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , tanaka & li ( 2014 ) , and latif et al .",

    "( 2012 ) ; mcquinn & oleary ( 2012 ) .",
    "a detailed recent review of work on the relative velocity is fialkov ( 2014 ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  2 , we lay out our approach and assumptions . in  3 , we present the structure of the relative velocity due to a point perturbation ( the green s function ) , and in  4 we compute the shift the relative velocity induces in the correlation function .",
    " 5 discusses this shift and shows how it can be traced back to the compact support of the green s function . ",

    " 8 concludes .",
    "an appendix presents mathematical results that we use in the paper to accelerate the numerical calculations of  4 .",
    "we begin by presenting our bias model and then outline how the spatial structure of the relative velocity ( which this model requires as an input ) can be found using a green s function approach .    throughout this paper , we use linear perturbation theory in configuration space and neglect redshift - space distortions .",
    "we model the low - redshift galaxy overdensity , denoted by @xmath7 , as being biased by the square of the relative velocity normalized by its mean value , following yoo et al .",
    "we then use perturbation theory to compute the correlation function and 3pcf (  4 &  6 respectively ) .    writing the relative velocity as @xmath8 ( baryon velocity minus dark matter velocity ) and @xmath9 ( the root mean square value )",
    ", we define the dimensionless @xmath10 and expand the galaxy overdensity in @xmath11 to ensure @xmath12 .",
    "mathematically , this is @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14\\ ] ] captures the standard perturbation theory linear and non - linear bias in the galaxy overdensity .",
    "( e.g. yoo et al .",
    "2011 ; yoo & seljak 2013 ) , so care must be exercised in comparing values across different works . ]",
    "@xmath6 in equation ( 1 ) is an unknown bias coefficient that , as discussed in @xmath15 , encodes how strongly the relative velocity affects galaxy formation .",
    "@xmath16 is the matter overdensity .",
    "we next outline how we compute the spatial structure of the relative velocity , a required input in our bias model ( 1 ) .",
    "since the true primordial density field at a given location is not known @xmath17 @xmath18 , we need to be able to compute the @xmath19 generated by an arbitrary density field .",
    "we therefore find the relative velocity due to a point perturbation and then integrate it against the true density field . though this latter is not known @xmath17 @xmath18 , its statistical properties are . as we will only be considering expectation values over @xmath19 , and thus over the density field",
    ", this is sufficient .    since the response to an impulse",
    "is called the green s function , we denote the relative velocity due to a point perturbation by @xmath20 . by symmetry",
    ", it must always point radially outward from the density point sourcing it .",
    "it points outward because dm infalls under gravity and baryons are static or pushed outwards by radiation pressure .",
    "we now define the green s function implicitly : @xmath21 to linear order , the relative velocity at redshift @xmath22 due to a primordial density field @xmath23 is found by integrating @xmath24 against the green s function .",
    "isotropy demands that @xmath25 .",
    "notice that @xmath26 represents the dipole moment of the density field weighted by @xmath27 , suggesting that multipole expansions will be natural moving forwards .",
    "figure 1 portrays schematically the use of the green s function to compute the relative velocity ( and its square ) due to an arbitary density field .",
    "the green s function formalism above makes it evident that in our bias model , the square of the relative velocity contributes to the correlation function only beginning at fourth order in the perturbed quantities .",
    "one overdensity is required to source a relative velocity field , as shown in the lefthand panel of figure 1 , and to produce @xmath28 ( equivalently , @xmath29 two overdensities are needed , as shown in the righthand panel of figure 1 . for a gaussian random field ,",
    "all odd moments vanish , meaning the velocity contributes to the correlation function beginning only at fourth order . to obtain all of the fourth order contributions to the correlation function",
    ", we must expand @xmath16 to second order in equation ( 2 ) : @xmath30 here and throughout , @xmath31 is the linear density field while @xmath32 is the second - order density field , which is @xmath33 .",
    "is evaluated at the dot by integrating the density field over all space weighted by the green s function @xmath34 the darker shading indicates that @xmath35 peaks at @xmath36 , a result discussed further in figure 2 .",
    "@xmath37 ( right panel ) is evaluated analogously but using two copies of the density field each weighted by the green s function .",
    "in practice , because of the green s function s structure ( see figure 2 ) , only density points within @xmath38 of the dot significantly contribute to the relative velocity there.,title=\"fig : \" ] is evaluated at the dot by integrating the density field over all space weighted by the green s function @xmath34 the darker shading indicates that @xmath35 peaks at @xmath36 , a result discussed further in figure 2 .",
    "@xmath37 ( right panel ) is evaluated analogously but using two copies of the density field each weighted by the green s function . in practice , because of the green s function s structure ( see figure 2 ) , only density points within @xmath38 of the dot significantly contribute to the relative velocity there.,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , we close this section with four further points about our perturbation theory framework .",
    "first , we note a subtlety of our bias model . @xmath39 and so if we carried through the expansion of the galaxy overdensity to higher orders in @xmath40 we would expect these terms to contribute to the correlation function at order unity times some combinatoric factor .",
    "for instance , in the limit that @xmath41}$ ] ( a 3-d dirac delta function ) one can compute explicitly that a term @xmath42 appears in @xmath43 if equation ( 1 ) is taken out to @xmath44 .",
    "since there are potentially an arbitrary number of these terms , one might ask if our expansion converges .",
    "however , physically , it is likely that the dimensionless parameter of importance for galaxy formation is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is some unknown , redshift - dependent circular velocity or velocity dispersion for a typical galaxy .",
    "we expect that @xmath47 so that an expansion in powers of this quantity would converge .",
    "our expansion , now with the coefficient of @xmath48 labeled by @xmath49 , may be rewritten in terms of @xmath50 by taking @xmath51 the @xmath52 are coefficients of an expansion in terms of powers of @xmath50 and are assumed to be all intrinsically on the same order of magnitude . solving for @xmath49 shows that it must fall rapidly with @xmath53 and our expansion converges .",
    "second , we justify the use of linear perturbation theory . though perturbation theory does not provide highly accurate fits to simulation results on small scales ( @xmath54 ) , the large scales ( @xmath55 ) relevant for the bao have remained roughly linear down to the present day ( for discussion of non - linear effects , see smith et al . 2003 ; seo et al .",
    "2008 ; sherwin & zaldarriaga 2012 , though see also roukema et al .",
    "the primary effect of what non - linear evolution has occurred is to broaden the bao peak in the galaxy - galaxy correlation function , not to shift its center . as eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2007a ) show , the peak position is robust in configuration space .",
    "further , modern bao surveys ( e.g. anderson et al .",
    "2014 ) use reconstruction to compute the peculiar velocity field implied by a given density field and reverse it , thus allowing analysis to be performed on a density field that is linear to even better approximation ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2007b ; seo et al .",
    "these considerations justify our use of linear perturbation theory to compute how the relative velocity effect shifts the bao peak .",
    "it is unambiguous to calculate the lowest order change in the correlation function and 3pcf the velocity produces . as we discuss above , higher order corrections",
    "should quickly become negligible .",
    "one can debate the precise details of the no - velocity correlation function , but the addition from the velocity to any model chosen can be accurately computed in perturbation theory .",
    "third , when computing the expansion of the density field to second order , we only consider effects generated by gravity .",
    "for example , we neglect effects due to couplings of radiation and matter .",
    "naoz & barkana ( 2005 ) point out that on small scales , the sound speed varies spatially after recombination due to density - dependent compton heating ( see also naoz et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) .",
    "this will not affect our conclusions because the bao scale is dominated by the relativistic sound speed prior to decoupling .",
    "another effect generated by coupling of radiation and matter is the impact of inhomogeneities in the intergalactic medium on the lyman-@xmath56 emission observed from galaxies ( wyithe & djikstra 2011 ) .",
    "this can create an additional clustering signal on large scales that would need to be properly accounted for if one wished to use the techniques in this work on a lyman-@xmath56 selected galaxy sample such as might be found using the hobby - eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex ) .    finally , we consider the effects of redshift - space distortions ( see hamilton 1998 for a review ) .",
    "peculiar velocities systematically alter galaxy clustering even on large scales ( kaiser 1987 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "2002 ) , introducing a strong directional dependence .",
    "these distortions do not substantially alter the green s function picture , because galaxy positions in redshift space are shifted by much less than the acoustic scale .",
    "however , the distortions can alter the resulting correlations because the true large - scale correlations are also small .",
    "these effects can be accurately treated in cosmological simulations , and we expect that studies of observational data would want to compare to full simulations . however , we note that our analysis will average over triangles irrespective of their orientation to the line of sight . while not optimal as regards information content , such averages do tend to reduce the effects of redshift distortions on large scales .",
    "for example , the redshift - space spherically averaged two - point correlation function on large scales is primarily a rescaling of the real - space result , with a mild extra broadening of the acoustic peak .",
    "we similarly expect that our orientation - averaged 3pcf results will be only mildly changed by redshift - space distortions .",
    "furthermore , the reconstruction of the linear density field discussed above can also correct redshift - space distortions on the scales relevant for this work by introducing a factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the linear growth function , and @xmath17 is the scale factor .",
    "this factor represents the additional squashing along the line - of - sight ( eisenstein et al .",
    "this technique should allow removal of the redshift - space distortions on the large scales most significant for the signature presented here .",
    "we now seek to obtain an explicit expression for the green s function .",
    "we begin with the linear theory continuity equation in configuration space . @xmath17",
    "is the scale factor and we use comoving positions and velocities .",
    "an overdot denotes a derivative with respect to time .",
    "we have @xmath60 which fourier transforms to @xmath61 where a tilde denotes a 3-d fourier transform given by @xmath62 with inverse transform @xmath63 for growing modes , @xmath64 is parallel to @xmath65 so @xmath66 this means @xmath67 where subscript c is for cdm , b for baryons , vbc for relative velocity , and we define the relative velocity transfer function @xmath68.\\ ] ] @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the baryon and cdm transfer functions , which give the evolution of each mode with redshift via @xmath71 @xmath72 is the primordial density perturbation related to the primordial power spectrum @xmath73 by @xmath74}\\left(\\vec{k}-\\vec{k'}\\right)p_{{\\rm pri}}\\left(k\\right)$ ] , with @xmath75 .",
    "is fixed by the value of @xmath76 today .",
    "] we emphasize that the relative velocity transfer function maps the primordial density field to a velocity field at some redshift @xmath77 so @xmath78 always acts on @xmath72 .",

    "we now have the desired velocity green s function . noting that its fourier transform is closely related to the velocity transfer function , for notational consistency we define @xmath89 and use @xmath90 going forward .    in practice ,",
    "we compute @xmath91 by transforming @xmath90 using equation ( 17 ) . thus we must first compute @xmath92 . using a flat @xmath93 cosmology with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , we output transfer functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 from camb ( lewis 2000 ) on a grid equally spaced in @xmath98 with 5,000 divisions per decade from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "to approximate @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( cf . equation ( 12 ) ) , we discretize the derivative at each redshift @xmath22 with @xmath103 . to avoid ringing due to the finiteness of our grid in fourier space , we use a smoothing @xmath104 $ ] to evaluate the integral ( 17 ) ( and all analogous integrals over @xmath105 in what follows ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the green s functions for @xmath106 and @xmath107 at @xmath108 .",
    "we have multiplied each by @xmath109 for two reasons .",
    "first , for a random distribution of densities , a spherical shell of radius @xmath110 will contribute as @xmath109 when integrated over volume .",
    "second , this weighting renders the fine structure more apparent .",
    "the most striking feature of figure 2 is the compact support of the @xmath107 green s function .",
    "this occurs because for @xmath111 , @xmath112 , as radiation pressure can not support the baryons against gravitational infall .",
    "also salient is that @xmath113 for @xmath114 : baryons are in hydrostatic equilibrium with @xmath115 .",
    "there is a bump in the baryon velocity at @xmath116 due to the outgoing baryon - photon overdensity from the bao .",
    "meanwhile , the dm infalls .    inside @xmath117 the dm infalls as roughly @xmath118 rather than @xmath119 because the baryon - photon fluid s contribution to the potential , which , during radiation domination , overshadows that of the dm overdensity at the origin , is diluted . for a test particle at @xmath120 ,",
    "some of the baryon - photon overdensity is outside a gaussian sphere of radius @xmath110 , and hence does not contribute to the gravitational force felt by the particle .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that modes inside the horizon grow less quickly than those outside the horizon during radiation domination , and is why the dm transfer function turns over for @xmath121 @xmath122 the wavenumber entering the horizon at matter - radiation equality .",
    "using the continuity equation in fourier space ( equation ( 7 ) ) , slower growth of a given mode implies a lower velocity field for that mode , so modes inside the horizon indeed have a lower velocity field than those outside the horizon .    , the relative velocity @xmath123 due to a @xmath124 density perturbation at the origin .",

    ", green will denote the green s function , plot symbol x will pertain to functions involving the relative velocity , red will be baryons , and blue cdm .",
    "note that for @xmath126 baryons and dm infall at the same speed .",
    "in contrast , inside @xmath116 the baryons are mostly locked in hydrostatic equilibrium while the dm infalls roughly as @xmath127 due to the dilution of the radiation density perturbation as this latter expands with time ( see  3 for further discussion ) .",

    "it is this asymmetric alteration that pulls the bao peak in or out in scale .",
    "fundamentally , then , the shift is due to the presence of an acoustic horizon : the relative velocity is at root a pressure effect , and as such can alter correlations roughly only within the sound horizon .    in greater mathematical detail ,",
    "the 6-d velocity kernel @xmath246 has support only for @xmath247 .",
    "convolving @xmath248 and @xmath249 with it act as smoothing operations that simply broaden its peak . since the smoothing functions are so narrow , the convolutions are only non - zero essentially where the velocity kernel is non - zero . for @xmath250",
    "this adds probability density inwards of @xmath36 , while for @xmath251 , this subtracts probability density inwards of @xmath36 .",
    "figure 4 shows the two smoothing functions , @xmath248 and @xmath249 ( built on transforms of @xmath252 ) , and the @xmath107 green s function they smooth .",
    "the behavior of the contribution from @xmath192 is complex , as it is a double convolution , but as we learned from the @xmath253}$ ] limit , it has support out to @xmath254 .",
    "however , around the bao peak location @xmath192 is roughly symmetric , so it does not contribute much to shifting the peak ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we now move to discuss each term in @xmath170 more extensively ; each term is shown in figure 5 .",
    "two of the terms are fairly simple in structure , and can be understood by recalling the limit @xmath255}$ ] of  4.2 .",
    "@xmath171 is roughly constant for @xmath120 , and drops quickly to zero outside the sound horizon .",
    "it extends slightly beyond the sound horizon ; this may be traced back to the smooth drop of the velocity green s function ( figure 2 ) produced by the neutrinos and silk damping .",
    "the small bump near the sound horizon is due to the baryons velocity there ; this has its origin in the baryon velocity s contribution to the green s function ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the bottom panel of figure 5 , plotting the @xmath255}$ ] limit . here , a bump is still present near the acoustic scale , meaning that the bump is due to structure in the velocity green s function and not due to any structure in @xmath183 .",
    "since @xmath171 is non - zero essentially solely inside @xmath129 , it adds asymmetrically to the correlation function and hence can pull the bao bump inwards ( @xmath256 ) or outwards ( @xmath257 ) .",
    "@xmath192 is also fairly simple and can also be understood by recalling the limit @xmath255}$ ] of  4.2 . from equation ( 35 )",
    ", we see that it is a double convolution , and that the first convolution produces a function identical , up to amplitude , to @xmath171 . however , this is then convolved with an additional velocity kernel , which is , unlike @xmath183 and @xmath249 , rather broad .",
    "thus there is overlap between the velocity kernel and the first convolution until nearly twice the sound horizon .",
    "however , @xmath192 is roughly symmetric around the acoustic scale out to @xmath258 on either side of it ; this means that in the region of the bao peak , @xmath192 is adding symmetrically to @xmath134 and hence will contribute minimally to shifting the peak .",
    "we now discuss the last remaining term in @xmath170 , @xmath146 .",
    "this term has the most complicated structure , a consequence of its generation by the second - order density field .",
    "this latter is non - local : computing @xmath259 requires integrating over all space ( see figure 3 , top panel , and equation ( 36 ) ) .",
    "hence this term requires correlating the entire linear density field with the velocity field .",
    "nonetheless , its behavior can be understood qualitatively . the second - order density field ( or the @xmath260 kernel ) represents non - linear gravitational evolution , which , in our green s function approach , pulls mass towards the origin .",
    "thus it is not surprising that @xmath249 is rather narrow .",
    "since @xmath249 is so narrow , it will only have non - zero overlap with @xmath205 where the latter is non - zero .",
    "this explains the compact support of @xmath146 .",
    "@xmath146 is able to become negative because @xmath249 does .",
    "note that ( figure 4 ) @xmath249 is positive very close to the origin ; this is what permits @xmath146 to become positive at intermediate scales , @xmath261 .",
    "overall , for @xmath256 , @xmath146 mostly adds to @xmath170 inwards of the bao bump and subtracts from it directly outside the sound horizon ; this asymmetric effect can shift the bao peak .    in summary , then , we have seen that of the three terms entering @xmath170 , only two make significant contributions to a peak shift . in both cases ,",
    "the shift is due to the compact support of these terms , which in turn results from the narrowness of the smoothing functions combined with the compact support of the velocity green s function .",
    "we now consider the relative importance of these two terms when they are added together with plausible values of the linear and non - linear bias .",
    "note that both of these terms are proportional to @xmath262 , so different values of @xmath262 will not alter their relative weights .",
    "@xmath146 is a factor of @xmath263 larger than @xmath171 , and so it dominates the total velocity contribution to @xmath131 for @xmath264 . the total velocity contribution to @xmath131 in figure 6",
    "thus looks very similar to @xmath146 .",
    "note however that the effects of @xmath192 are perceptible .",
    "in particular , inside @xmath129 , the addition for @xmath256 is greater in magnitude than that for @xmath257 .",
    "this is because for @xmath256 @xmath146 and @xmath192 are both mostly positive within @xmath129 , while for @xmath257 , @xmath146 flips sign but @xmath192 does not ( compare @xmath265 and @xmath266 curves in figure 6 ) .",
    "outside @xmath129 , the case is reversed . for @xmath257 , @xmath267 as",
    "is @xmath192 , while for @xmath256 , these two terms have opposite signs and thus interfere destructively .",
    "this point explains why the curve for @xmath265 is larger in magnitude than that for @xmath266 outside @xmath129 . finally , the convergence of the @xmath251 curves to those with @xmath268 at large @xmath110 is because the @xmath269 term is the only contribution for @xmath270 and it is symmetric in @xmath6 .",
    "note also that the curves are nearly anti - symmetric under sign flip in @xmath6 , not surprising since two of the terms manifestly have this symmetry .",
    "they are not perfectly anti - symmetric under this transformation due to the @xmath269 term .",
    "it is significant that the @xmath146 term dominates the velocity addition to @xmath131 because this means one need not measure @xmath271 as well as one measures @xmath272 to obtain a good correction to the correlation function .",

    ". however , we can gain heuristic intuition for their behavior by setting all angle - dependent terms to unity and considering the radial behavior of each function .",

    "we have therefore suppressed the diagonal by multiplying by a gaussian weighting @xmath358 $ ] . as the best numerical factor above . ]",
    "we also weight by @xmath359 to make the fine structure more apparent and to capture the expected contribution of each spherical shell with volume @xmath360 .",
    "as we might expect , the velocity signature is strongest in @xmath0 but has echoes in @xmath361 and additional structure in @xmath362 in particular , the velocity bias produces in @xmath363 an increment for triangles with two sides @xmath364 and a decrement for triangles with one side @xmath364 and one side @xmath365 .",
    "this is consistent with what we might expect from the pre - cyclic term , which also has an increment and decrement for these respective configurations .",
    "indeed , this can be roughly interpreted as a blurring of the structure present in the pre - cyclic @xmath0 velocity plot ( compare figure 8 , bottom panel , with the @xmath0 , @xmath262 panel in figure 9 ) .",
    "neither of the other bias coefficients contribute such an effect to @xmath363 .",
    "the velocity bias produces in @xmath366 a decrement for triangles with one side @xmath364 and one side @xmath365 .",
    "neither of the other bias coefficients contribute such an effect to @xmath366 .",
    "the results for @xmath367 and @xmath368 are very similar to those for @xmath366 .",
    "this is because the higher - order legendre polynomials are more sharply peaked at @xmath369 , and so the triangles with @xmath355 ( zero opening angle ) and @xmath370 are weighted heavily .",
    "the @xmath371s have series expansion @xmath372(1-\\mu)$ ] and so the drop in weight as @xmath373 decreases from 1 is more severe for higher @xmath374 . ]",
    "thus as @xmath375 for large @xmath376 , the same small subset of triangles is dominating the projection integral ( 57 ) , meaning the projections will be similar for @xmath376 and @xmath377 .",
    "the 3pcf decomposition we have presented thus far has two independent variables : the two triangle sides @xmath378 and @xmath379 .",
    "it is worthwhile to consider whether this information can be compressed into a function of one independent variable . by reducing the dimensionality of the problem ,",
    "such a compression would ease handling of the covariance matrix associated with an eventual measurement , for example by accelerating the computations required in analyzing a large number of mock catalogs .",
    "further , a clever compression might allow us to avoid entirely the squeezed limit ( isosceles triangles with small opening angle so that the third side approaches zero ) , in which perturbation theory is not expected to be valid because two of the galaxies are very close to each other .",
    "finally , a compression might allow us to focus on the set of triangles where the relative velocity is most pronounced : as figure 9 and our previous discussion indicate , the relative velocity is localized to specific triangles in all @xmath376 .",
    "in particular , on the scales expected to be better controlled observationally ( i.e. those with @xmath378 and @xmath380 ) , the relative velocity is in a fairly condensed region of the @xmath0 multipole .    with these desiderata in mind , we integrate the 3pcf s multipole moments ( displayed with weighting in figure 9 ) over one triangle side , but constrain this side to be within some fraction of the side that remains a free variable .",
    "we term this approach `` compression . ''",
    "if we integrate over @xmath381 $ ] and constrain @xmath382 , we can avoid any triangle side s nearing zero .",
    "the minimum of @xmath379 will be @xmath383 , and by the triangle inequality the minimum of the third side , @xmath384 , will be @xmath385 . thus all three triangle sides remain sufficiently large that perturbation theory should be valid .",
    "this compression scheme is shown in two different ways in figure 10 ; the top panel portrays its effect in configuration space , while the bottom panel shows the region of each panel in figure 9 integrated over .",
    "notice that the region of integraton captures much of the area where the relative velocity is important in @xmath0 .",
    "several intervals for @xmath379 were considered before choosing @xmath386 $ ] ; in an observational study the exact interval chosen might differ as optimality will somewhat depend on the signal - to - noise at different scales , an issue we do not treat in detail here .",
    "summarizing mathematically , to obtain the compressions at each @xmath376 split out by bias coefficient , denoted @xmath387 and @xmath388 , we compute @xmath389 where @xmath390 ranges over @xmath391 and @xmath392 is the volume of the shell being integrated over .",
    "figure 11 shows that each @xmath376 we study can be used to detect the relative velocity effect , with the strongest constraint coming from @xmath393 as might be expected given that this is the only mode where the velocity contributes in the pre - cyclic 3pcf .",
    "it is encouraging that @xmath361 through @xmath354 even show differences between the effect and no - effect models at scales @xmath394 as this smaller side length increases the number of triangles available in a given survey volume relative to triangles with side length @xmath395 where the effect is most pronounced in @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the effect in all @xmath376 s studied at scales @xmath396 is substantial , though survey volume limitations may not permit strong constraints to be derived from such large scales .",
    "we have weighted the compressions by @xmath305 to display the finer structure as well as to simulate shot noise - limited measurements .",
    "shot noise is inversely proportional to @xmath397 , the number of galaxies in a given spherical shell , so it scales as @xmath127 .",
    "meanwhile the signal is proportional to the number of galaxies , so @xmath398 .",
    "previous work by yoo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) has argued that the relative velocity effect can shift the scale at which the bao peak appears in the galaxy correlation function @xmath133 . in this work",
    ", we have shown that the relative velocity s shift to @xmath133 is generated because the relative velocity itself is non - zero only within the sound horizon at decoupling ( figure 2 ) .",
    "more precisely , we have explicitly calculated that the velocity corrections to the correlation function are all generated by convolving relatively narrow functions with a kernel that shares the radial structure of the velocity green s function .",
    "hence the spatial structure , in particular the compact support , of the green s function is inherited by the velocity corrections to @xmath133 .",
    "thus , these corrections can alter the correlation function only below roughly the sound horizon .",
    "has support out to @xmath254 , but since this term scales as @xmath297 it is less important than @xmath399 and @xmath400 , which drop nearly to zero outside @xmath129 . ] adding or subtracting from the correlation function only below this scale can change the radius at which the bao peak occurs ; a negative velocity bias pushes it outwards while a positive bias pulls it inwards .    to correct this shift and ensure that the bao remain an accurate cosmological ruler , the relative velocity bias must be measured .",
    "motivated by the previous work in fourier space of yoo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we have presented a configuration - space template for fitting the three - point function @xmath401 to isolate @xmath402 we have shown that the full 3pcf has robust radial signatures of the relative velocity effect that are unique and can not come from any other bias term at the order in perturbation theory to which we work , in agreement with yoo et al .",
    "furthermore , we have offered a useful basis for measuring the full 3pcf and then suggested a further scheme for processing these results .",
    "this scheme should unambiguously expose the relative velocity s signature while avoiding the regimes in which perturbation theory is expected to be inadequate .",
    "it will also likely ease handling of the covariance matrix if large numbers of mock catalogs are to be used for computing error bars .",
    "previous attempts to constrain the relative velocity observationally have focused on fourier space .",
    "we have already alluded to the advantages of configuration space in  1 , and we revisit these points here . on the theory side ,",
    "our configuration space approach has exposed the relatively simple spatial structure of the relative velocity .",
    "fourier - space work on the bispectrum does not render transparent which triangle configurations are optimal for velocity bias constraints .",
    "our configuration space approach immediately shows that , on scales small enough to measure with current surveys , the velocity signature is localized to a small region of triangle side lengths and a single multipole ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this localized signature ( see figure 9 ) naturally suggests that an integral over the desirable region would enhance the velocity signal - to - noise , an intuition borne out by our compression scheme results ( figure 11 ) , which , it should be noted , are weighted to reflect shot noise .    on the practical side , there are also considerable advantages to working in configuration space .",
    "as we have already discussed in  1 , edge - correction is much simpler in configuration space .",
    "further , pan & szapudi s ( 2005 ) measurement of the monopole moment of the 3pcf shows it is possible in practice to extract information from a multipole decomposition of the 3pcf .",
    "looking forward , in forthcoming work we will present a fast algorithm for computing the multipole moments of the 3pcf while accounting for edge correction . this work will also address in more detail the covariance matrix of the 3pcf .    thus far , the bispectrum technique of yoo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) has not been used to constrain the relative velocity .",
    "therefore three - point statistics remain an entirely unexploited means of gaining traction on the relative velocity , a situation we hope the configuration space signatures of this work will improve .",
    "nonetheless , recent work by yoo & seljak ( 2013 ) has used measurements of the power spectrum in the constant mass ( cmass ) sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr9 ( 260,000 galaxies ) to compute a root - mean square shift of @xmath403 in the bao peak position , showing this shift can potentially be of order the entire error budget for the bao distance measurement .",
    "it should be noted that yoo & seljak s best - fit parameter values imply no relative velocity at all ( the root - mean square shift is from integrating over the probability distribution of the linear , non - linear , and velocity biases ) . on the other hand , a velocity bias of as large as @xmath404 ( in our units ; they use different values of @xmath145 and @xmath147 from our fiducial case so @xmath6 must be rescaled for comparison ) is consistent with their measurement at one sigma .",
    ", so we rescale such that @xmath405 .",
    "their definition of @xmath271 differs from ours by a factor of @xmath175 and @xmath406 is having accounted for this .",
    "this has also been done where we quote @xmath407 in the best - fit case from their work . ]    a limiting factor in their analysis is the growth of the error bars at smaller wavenumber ( large scales ; see their figure 6 ) ; as our analysis shows ( see our figure 6 ) , large scales are important for the relative velocity s addition to the correlation function . in this context",
    "two points should be made .",
    "first , even when restricted to measurements of the power spectrum ( or correlation function ) , controlling the error bars on large scales should have significant rewards , meaning increasing the number of galaxies used for the measurement is highly desirable .",
    "thus use of the full sample of @xmath408 million galaxies in the most recent sdss data should offer compelling new constraints .",
    "second , the distinctiveness of the 3pcf signature , where obtaining the dipole @xmath330 moment already begins to isolate the velocity signature , should render the large - scale error bars less problematic even at fixed number of galaxies .",
    "finally , a separate issue our work clarifies is how to constrain the non - linear bias .",
    "our compressions show that the higher multipoles are extremely insensitive to the non - linear bias , while for @xmath361 and @xmath0 it contributes much more strongly than the linear bias for a given magnitude of both @xmath409 ( see figure 12 ) .",
    "given that the non - linear bias enters only at @xmath361 in our pre - cyclic calculation ( equation ( 52 ) ) , we indeed expect its projection onto @xmath361 and close - by multipoles to be strongest .",
    "this suggests that measuring different multipoles of the 3pcf , compressed as we outline , should offer a robust way to separate the linear bias from the non - linear bias . as the yoo & seljak ( 2013 ) best - fit measurement from cmass shows",
    ", the non - linear bias may be @xmath410 in our units ( their figure 6 ) , in which case figure 11 shows it would contribute @xmath411 of what the linear bias does at @xmath412 scales in @xmath413 but negligibly in @xmath354 and up .",
    "we hope the compression scheme presented here will , independent of its utility for relative velocity measurements , provide a new method to extract the non - linear bias from 3pcf measurements .    robustly separating the non - linear bias from other effects",
    "may also prove helpful in correcting the bao peak shift if one is found .",
    "yoo & seljak ( 2013 ) find that non - linear bias @xmath271 can also shift the bao peak .",
    "historically @xmath271 has been constrained using the 3pcf or bispectrum ( scoccimarro et al .",

    "2014 ) , and our compressions offer a particularly clear way to isolate @xmath271 from the linear bias @xmath272 and from the velocity bias @xmath262 .",
    "this separation should aid accurate measurements of both @xmath271 and @xmath262 and ensure the peak shift can be corrected .    with the percent - level constraints on the cosmic distance scale the bao method offers through surveys such as boss ( anderson et al .",
    "2014 ) and the concomitant limits on dark energy s equation of state @xmath414 ( aubourg et al .",
    "2014 ) , understanding any sources of bias is essential . in future work",

    "<S> we develop a configuration - space picture of the relative velocity between baryons and dark matter that clearly explains how it can shift the bao scale in the galaxy - galaxy correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the shift occurs because the relative velocity is non - zero only within the sound horizon and thus adds to the correlation function asymmetrically about the bao peak . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that in configuration space the relative velocity has a localized , distinctive signature in the three - point galaxy correlation function ( 3pcf ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that a multipole decomposition is a favorable way to isolate the relative velocity in the 3pcf , and that there is a strong signature in the @xmath0 multipole for triangles with 2 sides around the bao scale . finally , we investigate a further compression of the 3pcf to a function of only one triangle side that preserves the localized nature of the relative velocity signature while also nicely separating linear from non - linear bias . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this scheme will substantially lessen the computational burden of finding the relative velocity in the 3pcf . the relative velocity s 3pcf signature can be used to correct the shift induced in the galaxy - galaxy correlation function so that no systematic error due to this effect is introduced into the bao as used for precision cosmology . </S>"
