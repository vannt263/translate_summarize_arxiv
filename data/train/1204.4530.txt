    "according to big bang cosmologies , the rich matter structures seen today in our universe have grown from tiny density fluctuations at very early times .",
    "there are a number of competing theories for the physical origins of these primordial density perturbations , e.g. the ekpyrotic model @xcite or the string gas cosmology @xcite .",
    "the leading explanation is the inflationary paradigm @xcite .",
    "the standard single - field slowly - rolling inflationary model provides four fundamental predictions : a nearly flat spatial curvature for spacetime , a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations , a nearly gaussian distribution of primordial density perturbations , and a scale - invariant spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "the first three predictions have been tested by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ , * ? ? ?",
    "the discovery of primordial gravitational wave signatures in the cmb is one of the main goals for the _ planck _ mission @xcite .",
    "recently much attention has been turned towards using observations of the statistical properties of the large - scale structure to further falsify models for the origin of density perturbations .",
    "for example , single field inflation leads to a near - gaussian distribution of fluctuations @xcite . hence ,",
    "if significant departures from gaussianity are detected , all single - field inflationary models could be ruled out @xcite . in such models ,",
    "departures from gaussianity can be characterized by the local expansion of the primordial potential perturbations @xcite : @xmath11 , \\ ] ] here , @xmath12 denotes the gaussian potential perturbation at spacetime point @xmath13 after matter radiation equality , and the parameter @xmath0 quantifies the deviation from gaussianity . in linear theory ,",
    "typical fluctuations are very small with @xmath14 .",
    "thus , for @xmath15 , the typical non - gaussian corrections , are small , too : @xmath16 .",
    "currently , the best constraints on local - type primordial non - gaussianity come from the cmb bispectrum in the seven - year _ wmap _ data @xcite : at 68% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "though not widely anticipated a few years ago , it has recently been shown that probes of structures at lower redshifts could also provide competitive constraints , in particular the nonlinear matter power spectrum @xcite , the abundance of massive clusters @xcite , the galaxy bispectrum @xcite , and the scale - dependence of galaxy clustering @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the question : how well can a large weak lensing ( wl ) survey constrain the level of primordial non - gaussianity in the initial conditions ? this is of prime concern given upcoming surveys like the kilo degree survey ( kids , @xmath17 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the dark energy survey ( des , @xmath18 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or planned full sky surveys such as those with _",
    "( @xmath19 , * ? ? ? * ) or the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst,@xmath20 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there have been various forecasts for the expected error @xmath21 on the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 from future weak lensing surveys .",
    "for example , @xcite predicted that @xmath22 could be obtained from galaxy - galaxy lensing on large angular scales .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath23 a few tens may be possible from a @xmath24-analysis of the convergence power spectrum . using a halo model ,",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath25 for a combined analysis of the convergence power spectra and the abundance of shear peaks in a _ euclid_-like survey .",
    "@xcite predicted that @xmath26 could be achieved from analyzing convergence bispectra , which could be further reduced to @xmath27 if sufficiently tight priors on all other relevant cosmological parameters are available .",
    "@xcite found that a combined analysis of weak lensing and galaxy clustering could give @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath29 for an imaging survey combining cluster counts , the cluster correlation function , and stacked wl signals of clusters .    whilst this is encouraging , all these studies rely heavily upon approximations for the nonlinear matter power spectrum , bispectrum and analytic modelling of shear peak abundances that are not well tested or understood in non - gaussian models .",
    "furthermore , the gain in information from combining different probes has not yet been fully investigated .",
    "instead , approximations of various degrees of plausibility have been made for the cross - covariances between different observables .",
    "moreover , most of these forecasts ignore degeneracies of @xmath0 with other cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , one should be circumspect when interpreting these forecasts .    in this paper",
    "we take a more direct approach to answering this question .",
    "we use an ensemble of @xmath30-body simulations of structure formation in flat dark - energy cold - dark - matter ( @xmath31cdm ) cosmologies , through which we perform full gravitational ray - tracing to construct a suite of large mock weak lensing maps ( e.g. the maps for our fiducial cosmological model cover a total area of @xmath32 ) .",
    "initial results from these simulations were already presented in @xcite , where we showed that the abundance of shear peaks was sensitive to @xmath0 , and that one may obtain an error of @xmath33 when all other cosmological parameters are known . in this work we present a much wider study about combining information from the cosmic - shear two - point correlations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the aperture mass statistics @xmath36 , and the abundance of shear peaks @xmath37 .",
    "our approach allows us to fully explore the cross - correlations between these different weak lensing probes .",
    "furthermore , the initial suite of simulations used in @xcite are augmented with cosmological models that take into account variations in other cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , we can investigate the joint constraints from wl in the parameter space spanned by : the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath0 , the mean matter density @xmath38 , normalization @xmath2 and spectral index @xmath39 of the matter power spectrum , and the equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter @xmath4 of the dark energy ( de ) .",
    "ray - tracing simulations have been used recently by @xcite and @xcite to study the effects of primordial non - gaussianity on basic lensing quantities and the skeleton of the convergence field .",
    "in contrast to their work , we focus in our work on observables more easily accessible in weak lensing surveys .",
    "moreover , we include realistic levels of noise directly in our simulations for the error analysis .",
    "finally , our larger set of simulations allows us to explore a higher - dimensional parameter space in a uniform manner .",
    "the paper is broken down as follows : in section [ sec : theory ] , we briefly discuss the weak lensing cosmological probes that we employ in this study . in section [ sec : methods ] , we give an overview of the cosmological @xmath30-body simulations and the ray - tracing , and review how we estimate the observables and their covariance from the simulated data . in section [ sec : results ] , we consider the effects of primordial non - gaussianity on the weak lensing observables . we also discuss the expected statistical uncertainties and covariances of the weak lensing observables as well as their dependence on the full set of considered cosmological parameters .",
    "furthermore , we present forecasts for unmarginalized and marginalized constraints on cosmological parameters , and discuss possible biases arising from neglecting finite non - gaussianity .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary and discussion in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "gravitational lensing is the process whereby photon bundles emitted from distant light sources are deflected by the gravitational field of matter structures along the line of sight .",
    "these deflections can thus magnify , shift and shear the images of distant galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed image position @xmath40 of a source at redshift @xmath41 may thus differ from the source s ` true ' angular position @xmath42 .",
    "image distortions caused by differential deflection can be quantified locally by the distortion matrix @xmath43 whose decomposition defines the convergence @xmath44 , the complex shear @xmath45 , and the asymmetry @xmath46 . in weak lensing ,",
    "the asymmetry @xmath47 is usually small enough to be neglected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that case , the convergence @xmath48 and shear @xmath49 are related by a simple phase factor in fourier space .",
    "thus , in weak lensing , the shear field contains the same information as the convergence .    to a good approximation ,",
    "the convergence is given by a projection of the matter density along the line of sight weighted by a geometrical factor , which depends on the distances between observer , deflecting matter structure , and source .",
    "the convergence field thus bears information on the growth of structures as well as on the large - scale geometry of the universe .    for a population of sources with known redshift distribution @xmath50 ,",
    "an effective convergence and shear can be defined by @xmath51 furthermore , the shear @xmath52 at a position @xmath53 can be decomposed into a tangential component @xmath54 and a cross component @xmath55 with respect to any given direction @xmath56 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "owing to the fact that we do not know the intrinsic shapes of individual background galaxies , the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not direct observables .",
