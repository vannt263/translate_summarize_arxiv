    "recent observations of type ia supernovae with redshift up to about @xmath0 provided evidence that we may live in a low mass - density universe , with the contribution of the non - relativistic matter ( baryonic plus dark ) to the total energy density of the universe of the order of @xmath1 @xcite . the value of @xmath2 is significantly less than unity @xcite , and , consequently , either the universe is open or there is some additional energy density @xmath3 sufficient to reach the value @xmath4 , predicted by inflationary theory . observations also show that the deceleration parameter of the universe @xmath5 is in the range @xmath6 , and the present - day universe undergoes an accelerated expansionary evolution .",
    "several physical models have been proposed to give a consistent physical interpretation to these observational facts .",
    "photons propagating in extra - galactic magnetic fields can oscillate into very light axions , so the supernovae appear dimer and more distant than they really are @xcite . for the missing energy",
    "one candidate is the vacuum energy density , or the cosmological constant @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a charged universe , in which the long range force carriers have a small mass , has been considered as a cause for the cosmic acceleration in @xcite .",
    "another possibilities are cosmologies based on a mixture of cold dark matter and quintessence , a slowly - varying , spatially inhomogeneous component @xcite .",
    "an example of implementation of the idea of quintessence is the suggestion that it is the energy associated with a scalar field @xmath8 with self - interaction potential @xmath9 .",
    "if the potential energy density is greater than the kinetic one , then the pressure associated to the @xmath8-field is negative @xcite .",
    "quintessence models that accomodate the present day acceleration tend to accelerate eternally , and , as a consequence , the resulting space - times exhibit event horizons @xcite . a wide class of quintessence models , with eternal acceleration , associated with static metrics ,",
    "have been prezented in @xcite .",
    "brans - dicke ( bd ) theory may explain the present accelerated expansion of the universe without resorting to a cosmological constant or quintessence matter @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which the dynamics of a self - interacting bd field can account for the accelerated expansion have been considered in @xcite -@xcite .",
    "accelerated expanding solutions can be obtained with a quadratic self - coupling of the bd field and a negative coupling constant @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a cosmic fluid obeying a perfect fluid type equation of state can not support the acceleration @xcite .",
    "the nature of the scalar field potential compatible with a power law expansion in a self - interacting bd cosmology with a perfect fluid background has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "models with non - minimal coupling of the scalar field have been considered in @xcite .",
    "complicated cosmological scenarios , with a four - dimensional effective action connected with supergravity and string theory , have been obtained in @xcite .",

    "this action is identical to the low energy string theory action . in the present letter",

    ". the solution can be formally obtained from the previous one by means of the substitution @xmath105 , @xmath106 etc . in all these cases the energy density and pressure of the baryonic matter and of the scalar field follow from the field equations ( [ 2])-([31 ] ) .",
    "the first class of solutions depends on the set of five arbitrary constants @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath34 and @xmath10 . to determine them from the actual observational data we take the matter pressure to be zero , @xmath109 . for the age of the universe and the hubble constant",

    ", we assume an actual value of @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , by taking @xmath10 as a free parameter , we have four observational constraints to be satisfied by the model .",
    "thus the numerical values of the constants @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath34 can be obtained from fitting the model with the observations .",
    "generally , a physical solution for the resulting non - linear system of algebraic equations can be obtained only for small negative values of @xmath10 .",
    "the variation of the energy density of the matter and of the bd field is represented , for the first class of solutions , in fig .",
    "1 . generally , the energy density of the scalar field dominates the matter energy density , thus providing the dominant contribution to the total energy density .",
    "the deceleration parameter is represented , for different values of @xmath116 , in fig .",
    "@xmath5 is negative , with values in the range @xmath117 , indicating an accelerating evolution of the universe .",
    "the second class of solutions depends ( by chosing @xmath118 ) on three parameters @xmath119 , @xmath34 and @xmath10 .",
    "their numerical values can be obtained so that the solution fits the actual observational values of @xmath120 , @xmath2 and @xmath121 .",
    "the resulting algebraic system of equations has also a physical solution only for small negative values of @xmath10 .",
    "the time variations of the energy density of the matter and of the bd field and of @xmath5 for the second class of solutions are represented in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "the energy density of the scalar field dominates the matter energy density , and the evolution is accelerating .",
    "therefore , these two classes of solutions are compatible with the observed cosmological data only for small negative values of the coupling parameter of the bd field .",
    "an other important observational bound requires @xmath122 at nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "this condition can also be satisfied by appropriately chosing the matter equation of state in the very early stages of evolution of the universe . generally , in the present models we have @xmath123 , and the evolution is accelerating .",
    "an accelerating expansion during the whole evolution of the universe is not favored by the curent models of structure formation . however , as shown in @xcite , the scalar field , which is non - minimally coupled to gravity , may undergo clustering processes , eventually forming density perturbations , which can be investigated only within a non - linear approach , and leading to the formation of some cosmic structures . on the other hand , to satisfy the actual observational constraints , a much larger value than that predicted by the inflationary scenario is needed for the constant @xmath34 .",
