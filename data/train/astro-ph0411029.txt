    "the sculptor ( scl ) dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) is a close companion of the milky way at high galactic latitude ( _ b _",
    "=  @xmath483@xmath5 ) . located at a distance of 72 @xmath6  kpc ( kunkel & demers 1977 ) , with v@xmath7 109.9 @xmath8 km / s ( queloz , dubath & pasquini 1995 ) it has a low total ( dynamical ) mass , 1.4 @xmath9 ( queloz 1995 ) .",
    "irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) made the first modern comprehensive determination of the physical properties of scl .",
    "they determined a core radius , r@xmath10 arcmin , and a tidal radius , r@xmath11 arcmin with a position angle of 99 @xmath12 1 degrees , and confirmed it to be a moderately luminous galaxy in the dsph class ( m@xmath13 ) , with a modest central surface brightness ( @xmath14 mag / arcsec@xmath15 ) . like most dsph galaxies",
    "scl does not appear to have much , if any , hi gas ( bouchard , carignan & mashchenko 2003 ) .",
    "observations of scl have revealed a sizeable population of rr lyrae variable stars ( kaluzny 1995 ) , clearly indicating that its stellar population contains a globular cluster age component .",
    "scl also shows tantalizing evidence in its extended horizontal branch ( hb ) for an unusual enrichment history ( hurley - keller , mateo & grebel 1999 ; majewski 1999 ) .",
    "monkiewicz ( 1999 ) have detected stars several magnitudes below the oldest possible main - sequence turn - offs .",
    "their accurate photometry allowed them to conclude that the mean age of scl is similar to that of a globular cluster , but that there is an age spread within this epoch indicative of an extended star formation history .",
    "thus the entire star formation history of scl apparently lasted only a few gyr , and after this initial period of activity more than 10  gyr ago scl appears to have been dormant .",
    "there have been several previous spectroscopic studies of individual stars in scl , firstly to determine the kinematic properties ( armandroff & da costa 1986 ; aaronson & olszewski 1987 ; queloz et al . 1995 ) which have indicated a moderate mass - to - light ratio m / l@xmath16(m / l@xmath17)@xmath18 .",
    "this value is significantly higher than that typical for a globular cluster , but much lower than found for many dsphs ( draco and ursa minor ) .",
    "there have also been studies of the abundances of small samples of individual red giant branch ( rgb ) stars at low and high resolution ( shetrone 2003 ; tolstoy 2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "these stars were selected from the central region of scl , and although they showed a wider range in [ fe / h ] than would be naively expected based on colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) analysis , no conclusions could be drawn on the large scale spatial variations of these properties .    here",
    "we present the first results from the dart ( dwarf abundances and radial velocities team ) large programme at eso .",
    "we present the results for v@xmath1 and [ fe / h ] measurements from our flames spectroscopy of 401 rgb stars for the first galaxy in our sample , scl dsph . the relatively high signal / noise , s /",
    "n ( @xmath19 10 - 20 per pixel ) of our data has enabled us to derive both accurate metallicites ( @xmath19 0.1 dex from internal errors ) and radial velocities ( to @xmath202 km / s ) .",
    "this is the first time that a large sample of both types of measurement has been made in a single galaxy .",
    "a more detailed description of our data and data reduction techniques will be provided in subsequent papers ( irwin in prep ; hill in prep ; battaglia in prep ) . here",
    "we provide an overview of our first intriguing results .",
    "the eso wide field imager ( wfi ) observations were obtained from the eso archive for the central region of scl , and more extended observations of outer fields were made by us .",
    "we used the pipeline reduction software developed by the cambridge astronomical survey unit for processing mosaic camera imaging ( irwin & lewis 2001 ; irwin 2004 ) .",
    "these observations were used to study the photometric properties of scl stars out to the tidal radius and as target selection for vlt / flames observations of stars along the rgb .",
    "all vlt / flames observations were made in medusa mode , giving @xmath21120 fibres to be placed over a 25 arcmin diameter field of view .",
    "most of the observations were taken with the low resolution grating lr8 ( which includes the ca  ii triplet ( cat ) lines ) , apart from the central pointing where high resolution gratings were used ( see hill in prep ) .",
    "the cat method is well calibrated to provide an accurate estimate of the [ fe / h ] abundance of an rgb star ( rutledge , hesser & stetson 1997 ; cole 2004 ) and also to provide an accurate radial velocity measurement .",
    "the flames fields were placed at varying distances from the centre of the galaxy to beyond the tidal radius .",
    "the flames data were all reduced , extracted and wavelength calibrated using the girbldrs pipeline provided by the flames consortium ( geneva observatory , blecha 2003 ) . for sky subtraction , velocity and equivalent width ( ew ) estimation , we developed our own software which was thoroughly checked on multiple observations of the same fields taken at different times .",
    "wavelength shifts were generally found to be negligible ( @xmath201 km / s ) .",
    "each target spectrum was automatically continuum - corrected and cross - correlated with a zero - continuum gaussian model cat template . with a velocity determined it is then straightforward to estimate the ew of the individual cat lines .",
    "we found that for reliable [ fe / h ] determinations from cat calibrations a s / n @xmath0 10 is required , and for reliable v@xmath1 a s / n @xmath0 7.5 is sufficient .",
    "all the plots in this paper use the s / n @xmath22 data set , as we always consider both the [ fe / h ] and the v@xmath1 measurements .    we were able to verify the zero point accuracy for both velocity and abundance determinations by comparison with independent previous measurements of stars in scl , which we had deliberately reobserved .",
    "we also have overlap between our own hr and lr samples to verify consistency of velocity and [ fe / h ] measurements using different gratings and based on different abundance determination methods .",
    "previous studies have already suggested that the spatial distribution of the horizontal branch stars in scl shows signs of a population gradient , with the red horizontal branch stars ( rhb ) being more tightly concentrated than the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars ( hurley - keller 1999 ; majewski 1999 ) .",
    "unlike previous wide field studies , our wfi imaging data extends beyond the nominal tidal radius and with an average 5-@xmath23 limiting magnitude of v@xmath2423.5 and i@xmath2422.5 also probes well below the horizontal branch .",
    "this has enabled us to unequivocally demonstrate that the bhb and rhb stars have markedly different spatial distributions ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "these rhb and bhb populations were selected from the wfi cmd shown in figure  2 using the selection boxes marked .",
    "it is clear that the bhb region is almost completely uncontaminated by foreground stars , whereas the rhb zone includes a significant underlying foreground component . to make a quantitative estimate of the contamination of the rhb sample by foreground stars we selected a region of similar cmd foreground occupancy , well away from the scl stellar locus ( also outlined in figure  2 ) .",
    "the radial density distributions of the rhb component were then corrected by the expected foreground contamination and the results for both the rhb and bhb distributions together with their density ratio as a function of radial distance , are shown in the lower panels of figure 1 .",
    "the different spatial occupancy of the two populations is striking and provides strong evidence that we are seeing two distinct components .",
    "the characteristics of the bhb and rhb are also consistent with different ages ( @xmath252  gyr ) , or different metallicities ( @xmath26[fe / h]@xmath210.7 dex ) , from theoretical modelling of globular cluster horizontal branches by lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "our vlt / flames spectroscopic sample provides measurements of [ fe / h ] for 401 individual candidate rgb - selected stars with final s / n@xmath2710 , of which 308 have a high membership probability ( these are plotted in figure  3 ) , defined to be 80 km / s @xmath28 v@xmath1 @xmath28 150 km / s approximately within 3@xmath23 of v@xmath29 ( see figure 4 ) . at the high galactic latitude of scl v@xmath1 is a good estimator of membership probability assuming v@xmath30 km / s , and @xmath31 10 km / s .    for those rgb stars which were determined to have a high probability of membership , we show the distribution of [ fe / h ] measurements as a function of elliptical radius ( the equivalent distance along the semi - major axis ) from the centre of scl in the upper panel of figure  3 . a well - defined metallicity gradient is apparent with a similar scale size to the rhb versus bhb spatial distributions .",
    "the lower panel of this figure highlights the abrupt change in the [ fe / h ] distribution that occurs at about r@xmath32  deg ( 2r@xmath33 ) and also the broad range in [ fe / h ] over the whole galaxy . although both inner and outer distributions cover a broad range of values , the inner is centred at [ fe / h]@xmath34 with a range of @xmath35dex and the outer distribution is centred at [ fe / h ] @xmath36 with a similar range of @xmath37dex .",
    "the drop in @xmath28[fe / h]@xmath27 at 2r@xmath33 from the centre also corresponds to the transition between the dominance of the rhb and bhb populations seen in figure 1 .",
    "this is not seen if the colour of the rgb alone is taken as an indication of metallicity .      in the upper panel of figure  4",
    "we plot the sample of v@xmath1 measurements versus elliptical radius for which the continuum s / n @xmath38 .",
    "the distinction between foreground stars and members of scl is generally unambiguous .",
    "the clustering around the systemic velocity of v@xmath30 km / s is clear and is highlighted by the dashed line and the dotted 3@xmath23 deviation limits .",
    "although present , foreground contamination can be seen to be almost negligible , even in the outer regions , which simplifies subsequent analysis .    we have divided our `` member '' sample into metal - poor ( [ fe / h@xmath2 ) and metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath39 ) distributions .",
    "this difference is quantified in the lower panels of figure  4 which shows the v@xmath1 distributions over three radial zones for the different metallicity components separately .",
    "the variation in v@xmath29 and @xmath23 in these three regions is computed using the maximum likelihood approach described in hargreaves ( 1994 ) , but modified to directly compute the likelihood function over a 2d search grid .",
    "we found that v@xmath29 does not vary significantly between different populations or regions , but @xmath23 does ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "one obvious feature of the velocity distributions is the difference in the kinematic properties of the two metallicity components . in general",
    "the more metal poor component has a higher velocity dispersion than the more metal rich component .",
    "this difference is most striking in the central panel ( @xmath40 r @xmath41 ) of the triptych where @xmath23 is 11.0@xmath121.0 km / s and 6.8@xmath120.8 km / s respectively .",
    "the swap in the dominance of the components is stark in the outer zone ( r @xmath27 0.5 ) , where there are hardly any stars at all in the metal - rich category and provides compelling evidence that we are indeed observing two dynamically different components in scl .",
    "our flames results show that scl contains two distinct stellar components , one metal - rich , @xmath42 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 , and one metal - poor , @xmath43 [ fe / h ] @xmath44 .",
    "the metal - rich population is more centrally concentrated than the metal poor , and on average appears to have a lower velocity dispersion , @xmath45 km / s , whereas @xmath46 km / s ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "our wfi results show that there is a comparable difference over the same scale in the spatial distribution of bhb stars and rhb stars .",
    "plausibly combining these results enables us to distinguish these two distinct components on the basis of kinematics ( figure 4 ) , metallicity ( figure 3 ) and spatial distribution ( figure 1 ) .",
    "these large samples allow us for the first time to quantify these large scale trends in a statistically meaningful fashion .",
    "there are indications that this is a common feature of dsph galaxies . our preliminary analysis of v@xmath1 and [ fe / h ] measurements in the other galaxies in our sample ( fornax and sextans dsph , battaglia et al .",
    ", in prep ) also shows very similar characteristics to scl , especially in the most metal poor component",
    ". the mix of populations between the inner and outer regions is clearly changing .",
    "the radial velocity studies of wilkinson ( 2004 ) and kleyna ( 2004 ) have also considered the possibility that kinematically distinct components exist in ursa minor , draco and sextans .",
    "what mechanism could create two ancient stellar components in a small dwarf spheroidal galaxy ?",
    "a simple possibility is that the formation of these dsph galaxies began with an initial burst of star formation , resulting in a stellar population with a mean [ fe / h ] @xmath47 .",
    "subsequent supernovae explosions from this initial episode could have been sufficient to cause gas ( and metal ) loss such that star formation was inhibited until the remaining gas could sink deeper into the centre and begin star formation again ( mori , ferrara & madau 2002 ) .",
    "thus the subsequent generation(s ) of stars would inhabit a region closer to the centre of the galaxy , and have a higher average metallicity ( @xmath48 ) and different kinematics .",
    "another possible cause is external influences , such as minor mergers , or accretion of additional gas",
    ". it might also be that events surrounding the epoch of reionisation , strongly influenced the evolution of these small galaxies ( bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2001 ) and resulted in the stripping or photoevaporation of the outer layers of gas in the dsph , meaning that subsequent more metal enhanced star formation occured only in the central regions .",
    "the full abundance analysis of the flames hr data ( hill et al . in prep ) will provide more details of the chemical enrichment history of scl .",
    "this will hopefully enable us to distinguish between two episodes of star formation , each of which created the separate kinematic components seen here , or more continuous star formation , manifested as a gradient in velocity dispersion and metallicity from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "here we have shown that even dsphs , the smallest galactic systems , did not form simply , as might be assumed .",
    "the wealth of data presented here points to the presence of dynamically distinct components in these galactic building blocks , or templates , and provides a stimulus to theories of the formation and evolution of dsphs .",
