    "johnson , r. v. kadison , and j. ringrose introduced a notion of amenability for von neuman algebras which modified johnson s original definition for banach algebras[8 ] in the sense that it takes the dual space structure of a von neumann algebra into account .",

    "the concept of approximate amenability for a banach algebras was introduced by f. ghahramani and r. j. loy in [ 5 ] .",

    "for example if @xmath15 is a locally compact group , then @xmath16 is a dual banach algebra(with @xmath17 ) , or if @xmath1 is an arens regular banach algebra then @xmath18 is a dual banach algebra .",

    "it follows that @xmath174    one of the unsatisfactory sides of dealing with approximate connes - amenability for dual banach algebras is the apparent lack of a suitable intrinsic characterization in terms of approximate normal , virtual diagonals .",
    "we saw that dual banach algebras with an approximate normal , virtual diagonal are approximately connes - amenable , but the converse is likely to be false in general .",
    "however for a compact group g the converse is true :        we now modify the definition of approximate normal , virtual diagonal and obtain the desired characterization .",
    "let a be a dual banach algebra with predual @xmath12 and let @xmath175 be the multiplication map .",
    "from [ 12 , corollary 4.6 ] , we conclude that @xmath176 maps @xmath12 into @xmath177[14 ] .",
    "consequently , @xmath178 induces the homomorphism @xmath179 with these preparations made , we can now characterize approximately connes - amenable , dual banach algebras through the existence of certain approximate normal , virtual diagonals .",
    "this is indeed an approximate version [ 12 , theorem 4.8 ] .",
    "proof @xmath59 : first , note that @xmath182 is canonically mapped into @xmath183 . define a derivation @xmath184 since the dual module @xmath185 is normal , then it follows that d is @xmath27continuous .",
    "clearly , d attains its values in the @xmath27closed submodule @xmath186 .",
    "since it is a normal dual banach a - module , then there is a net @xmath187 such that @xmath188 letting @xmath173 , we see that it is the approximate @xmath0virtual diagonal for a.    @xmath166 let x be a normal , dual banach a - bimodule . by proposition 2.9 we may assume that x is unital , and let @xmath3 be a @xmath27derivation .",
