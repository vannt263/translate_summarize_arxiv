    "much interest , both experimental[1 - 10 ] and theoretical[11 - 26 ] , was devoted in recent years to the production of @xmath0 meson in hadronic collisions and electroproduction processes .",
    "in analogy with @xmath8 production through excitations of the @xmath13 ( 1232 mev ) p33 resonance , it is believed that @xmath0-meson production in nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions proceeds via the excitation of nucleon isobars .",
    "because of isospin conservation however , only i=@xmath14 n@xmath5 isobars which decay into @xmath0n pair are important .",
    "pion and photon induced reactions@xcite provide strong evidence that near threshold , the n@xmath5(1535 mev ) @xmath15 resonance dominates @xmath0 production .",
    "this is not unexpected in view of the proximity of its mass to that of the @xmath0n pair and , its large branching ratio ( 30 - 55@xmath16 ) for n@xmath17 decay@xcite .",
    "the couplings to other resonances are week and seem to play a minor role close to threshold .",
    "the production of @xmath0 mesons in nn collisions was considered by several groups[11 - 16 ] within one boson exchange ( obe ) models , where the n@xmath5 ( 1535 mev ) is excited via the exchange of a boson b and then decays into @xmath0n pair .",
    "much of the uncertainties in the predictions of these model calculations concern the coupling of the mesons exchanged to the s11 resonance .",
    "the coupling of the @xmath8 and @xmath0 are known from the decay widths of this resonance but not so well the coupling of other mesons . assuming vector meson dominance , germond and wilkin@xcite determined the @xmath18 coupling from @xmath19 data and , as there is no evidence for isoscalar photon coupling to the @xmath20 they neglect the contribution from @xmath9 exchange .",
    "vetter et al.@xcite determined the @xmath18 coupling from the empirical decay width of @xmath21 for the n@xmath5 to decay into two pions .",
    "they suggested a value @xmath22 , nearly a factor of @xmath23 weaker than that deduced by germond and wilkin@xcite .",
    "although no experimental evidence exists , they assumed that the @xmath9 also couples to the n@xmath5 with @xmath24 , resulting with about equal @xmath18 and @xmath9 contributions@xcite .",
    "contrary to this , with the @xmath18 coupling taken from vector dominance , the cross section is dominated by @xmath18 exchange@xcite while the @xmath9 with a coupling as proposed by vetter et al.@xcite may influence the total cross section at most by @xmath25 .",
    "it is not clear though whether such a contribution is required to explain the existing @xmath26 data .",
    "in addition to these uncertainties concerning the coupling constants , the relative phases of different meson exchange amplitudes are unknown . taking these to be ones of signs and restricting the model to @xmath8 , @xmath0 , @xmath9 and @xmath18 exchanges only , there are eight solutions for the transition amplitude , one for each of the sign combinations possible .",
    "a solution , where the @xmath18 and @xmath8 exchanges add destructively , seems to explain best the cross section data for the @xmath26 reaction@xcite .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to consider @xmath0 meson production in nn collisions within a relativistic covariant obe model , where a virtual boson b produced on one of the incoming nucleons , is converted into an @xmath0 meson on the second nucleon ( see fig .",
    "each of the different exchange contributions to the production amplitude is determined by three factors , representing a source function of the b - n - n vertex , a boson propagator and a conversion amplitude for the @xmath1 process .",
    "only the latter depends on unknown boson - isobar couplings .    in variation with previous calculations the @xmath0 production amplitude includes four terms , corresponding to s and u- channels with nucleon isobars ( diagram 2a-2b ) and nucleon excitations ( diagram 2c-2d ) in the intermediate states .",
    "at threshold the contribution from s - channel n@xmath5 pole ( diagram 2c ) , hereinafter referred to as a resonance production term , dominates the process .",
    "the other diagrams , by far less important , furnish a background term .",
    "though the various exchange amplitudes and calculated cross sections remain similar to the ones calculated previously using a non relativistic obe model@xcite , the present model has distinct features which make predictions considerably more reliable . particularly , in the limit where all @xmath0 s are produced via n@xmath5 excitations ,",
    "interference terms between the overall contribution from scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchanges with that from vector mesons cancel out . consequently , the model predictions are insensitive to the choice of the relative phases of vector meson exchanges with respect to those of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons .    the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 details of the formalism and model parameters are presented . in sect .",
    "3 we write the s - wave production amplitude in a simple form suitable for numerical calculations . in sect .",
    "4 we discuss interference between various exchange contributions . the relative importance of various contributions to the amplitude and cross section for the @xmath27 reactions",

    "we conclude and summarize in sect . 7 .",
    "to calculate the primary production amplitude for the @xmath6 reactions , with @xmath28 designating a bound or unbound two - nucleon state , we employ a fully covariant formalism based on an effective obe model .",
