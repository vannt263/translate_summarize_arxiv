    "neurons exhibit all - or - none responses to external input signals . the main function of this thresholding behavior is to process information in a way that is efficient and robust to noise @xcite .",
    "input signals received by most non - sensory neurons take the form of pulse trains , coming from the spiking activity of neighboring neurons . therefore , in order to understand the mechanisms of information processing in neural systems , it is very important to characterize in detail the response of neurons to pulse trains . furthermore , realistic pulse trains are intrinsically dynamical , with an instantaneous firing frequency that varies continuously in time .",
    "it is therefore necessary to assess the influence of this non - stationarity in the neuronal response .",
    "this paper addresses these questions .",
    "most studies of driven neurons have been restricted so far to harmonic driving signals @xcite .",
    "many of these works have shown that for certain types of neurons , i.e. those exhibiting what is called type ii excitability , a resonant behavior arises with respect to the external driving frequency .",
    "excitability in those neurons is usually associated with an andronov - hopf bifurcation , which leads to the existence of subthreshold oscillations in the excitable regime .",
    "when the frequency of these oscillations equals that of the harmonic driving , a resonance arises .",
    "it is to be expected that a similar resonant behavior exists for pulsed inputs . in that case",
    ", the same pulse train impinging on two different neurons could elicit a response on only one of them , i.e. on the one that is tuned to resonate with the incoming pulse frequency .",
    "this behavior has indeed been observed experimentally in a rat s neocortical pyramidal neuron that innervates another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron ; a bursting input from the innervating neuron produced an action potential in the interneuron but not in the second pyramidal neuron @xcite .",
    "this behavior was interpreted in terms of a differential frequency - dependent facilitation and depression , respectively , and as such was studied by izhikevich and co - workers @xcite . here",
    "we propose a simpler mechanism for this phenomenon , relying only on the resonant behavior of the processing neuron .",
    "this mechanism could provide a means for distinguishing between firing rates , whose controlled variation lies at the heart of the rate coding approach to information processing by neurons .",
    "our results show that type ii excitable neurons exhibit a resonant response with respect to the frequency of input pulse trains .",
    "this behavior leads to episodic synchronization between the neuron s output and an input with dynamically varying firing rate .",
    "episodic synchronization has previously been reported in coupled lasers with intrinsic dynamics @xcite .",
    "here we extend that property to externally driven excitable systems .",

    "the behavior shows features common to the harmonic case , such as the existence of the same resonant frequency in type ii for both kinds of inputs .",
    "but there are also very interesting differences between them , specially in the high and zero frequency limits .",
    "the main difference between the harmonic and pulsed input cases is the approach to the dc threshold current ( @xmath17  ma for type i and @xmath18  ma for type ii ) . while in the former case",
    "this happens for frequencies approaching zero ( type i ) or resonance ( type ii ) , for pulsed inputs it happens for high frequencies , i.e. when the signal period is of the order of the pulse width .",
    "this is the reason for the appearance of a spiking region at high frequencies for pulsed inputs , which is absent in the harmonic case @xcite .",
    "also , in the low - frequency limit one can observe , for pulsed inputs , a constant value of the critical amplitude .",
    "this is related with the fact that , when the input period is high enough with respect to the pulse width , the system response is essentially independent of the period .      in the previous section , we have characterized the behavior of a neuron subject to a pulsed synaptic current of fixed frequency .",
    "our results show that type ii neurons exhibit a resonant behavior , defined by the existence of an optimal frequency for which the critical amplitude for spiking is minimal .",
    "the question now is , what happens if the frequency of the input train varies dynamically , which is a more realistic situation for a non - sensory neuron .    to answer this question , we made simulations with two morris - lecar neurons coupled unidirectionally through a chemical synapse .",
    "the input neuron operates in the limit cycle regime and is considered to be type i , so that we can control its spiking frequency by varying its applied current @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this neuron is synaptically coupled to a type ii neuron operating in an excitable regime , with a coupling strength @xmath20 such that the receiving neuron only fires in a given range of frequencies ( i.e. the coupling is such that the amplitude of the input pulses lies below the critical amplitude at zero frequency but above its minimum at resonance ; this corresponds e.g. to a horizontal line at around 0.4 mv in the right plots of fig .",

    "lower plot : time series of the receiving neuron .",
    ", height=226 ]    it can be seen that as the input frequency increases ( first half of the plot ) , the receiving neuron starts spiking with approximately 1:1 frequency ratio when the input frequency falls within the corresponding locking range , the ratio decreasing when the input frequency exceeds @xmath4520  hz . spiking persists while the input frequency remains in the wider ( not 1:1 ) locking range , and is maintained even for a while after the input finally exits the locking region .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for decreasing frequencies , but the `` inertia '' observed at the exit of the locking region is larger than for increasing frequencies .",
    "the time series of the receiving neuron is shown in the lower plot ; the episodes of synchronization with the input signal are clearly observed .    in order to understand the dynamic driving effects reported above , and particularly the locking asymmetry observed between an increase and a decrease in the input firing frequency",
