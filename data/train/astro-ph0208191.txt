    "qsos or quasars represent the high luminosity end of a class of objects known as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "they are the most luminous continuously emitting objects in the universe and emit over the entire range of electromagnetic waves .",
    "it is widely believed that high energy emission ( x - rays and @xmath15-rays ) from an agn originates in the innermost region of accretion disk around a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) and much of the low energy emission e.g. , infrared , optical , ultraviolet , is due to the reprocessing of high energy photons in a medium surrounding the accretion disk . while the atomic line emission in the optical , uv , and x - ray probe the circumnuclear medium surrounding the smbh , the shape of the x - ray spectrum described by photon index ( @xmath16 ) is a critical parameter to constrain competing models for the mechanisms of x - ray continuum emission .",
    "the increased sensitivity of the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on - board _ rosat _ compared to earlier missions allowed a significant improvement in the study of the soft x - ray emission of agns .",
    "the x - ray spectral shape of quasars has been studied extensively using earlier missions such as _ heao - i , einstein , exosat , and ginga _",
    "( e.g. , mushotzky 1984 ; wilkes & elvis 1987 ; canizares & white 1989 ; comastri et al .",
    "1992 ; lawson et al .  1992 ; williams et al .",
    "some of these missions were not sensitive below @xmath17 .",
    "these earlier studies suggested that the x - ray emission of quasars is well described by a power - law with photon index @xmath18 for radio - loud quasars and @xmath19 for radio quiet quasars .",
    "large samples of agns have been studied by walter & fink ( 1993 ) , wang , brinkmann & bergeron ( 1996 ) , and by rush et al .",

    "the sample of reeves & turner ( 2000 ) includes some high redshift quasars but most of the quasars are nearby and the sample is not complete .",
    "we present the results of a detailed spectral and timing analysis of a nearly complete sample of 22 type  1 qsos obtained from the _ rosat _ pspc deep survey of mchardy et al .",
    "the basic parameters of the qsos are listed in table  [ basic_par ] .",
    "we will refer to all the objects as qso , independent of their luminosity , but note that some have low x - ray luminosity ( see table  [ fit91_result ] ) .",
    "the aims are to extend the study of soft x - ray properties of qsos at higher redshifts and to investigate whether qsos at high redshifts have excess soft x - ray emission similar to that seen in the narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies .",

    "+    in order to investigate any change in the soft x - ray spectral shape and flux , we have also analyzed the pspc spectra of the qsos observed in 1993 .",
    "the pspc spectra of the qsos and the corresponding background spectra were extracted from the observation of 1993 using the similar extraction regions as for the observation of 1991 .",
    "the same spectral models , namely redshifted and absorbed power - law model with as a free parameter and fixed to the galactic , as described above were fitted to the pspc spectra obtained in 1993 .",
    "the power - law model with as a free parameter is a good description to the observed pspc spectra of individual qsos .",
    "except for the qsos mjm  7 and mjm  10 , the galactic along the line of sight of each qso was found to be well within the range of derived .",
    "therefore , the power - law model with fixed to the galactic value was fitted to the spectrum of each qso .",
    "the best - fit parameters derived are given in table  [ fit93_result ] .",

    "the power - law fit with fixed to the galactic value is not acceptable ( reduced @xmath42 for 18 dof ) .",
    "addition of an absorbing component , apart from the galactic absorption component , local to the qso gives an acceptable fit ( reduced @xmath43 for 17 dof ) the best - fit parameters are @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the f - statistic value for the addition of the intrinsic absorption component to the power - law with fixed at the galactic value is 11.4 and the f - statistic probability is @xmath46 .",
    "thus the addition of an excess absorption at the qso redshift to the power - law model with fixed is a significant improvement at @xmath47 level .    the power - law model with as a free parameter is an acceptable fit ( reduced @xmath48 for 11 dof ) to the pspc spectrum of mjm  10 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "the best - fit power - law model with fixed to the galactic value is also an acceptable fit ( reduced @xmath52 for 12 dof ) although the fit is becomes poor again indicating excess absorption .",
    "next , we introduced an additional absorbing component local to the source and carried out the model fitting .",
    "the fit is an acceptable fit ( reduced @xmath53 for 11 dof ) .",
    "the f - statistic value for the addition of new component to the power - law model with fixed is 5.24 and the corresponding f - statistic probability is @xmath54 . hence the power - law model modified by galactic absorption and intrinsic absorption is a significant improvement at @xmath55 level but not a significant improvement at @xmath56 level over the power - law model with galactic absorption . in the case of mjm  15",
    ", an excess absorption is not inferred from the 1993 observations .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the low s / n and poor spectral resolution of the pspc spectra of mjm  15 .",
    "optical spectra of 12 of the 22 qsos were obtained on the night of 1994 april 7 with the multi object spectrograph ( mos ) on the 3.6-m canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) as a part of a program to identify x - ray sources ( mchardy et al .",
    "a @xmath57 grism in the first order with a lorel3 ccd detector was used to cover a wavelength range of @xmath58@xmath59 with @xmath60 resolution .",
    "optical spectra of the 12 qsos were reduced using iraf ( v2.11.3 ) . for details of the reduction",
    "see mchardy et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the flux calibration is somewhat uncertain because the slitlets were not aligned at the parallactic angle .",
    "the flux calibrated spectra were corrected for galactic extinction by adopting the extinction law in cardelli et al .",
    "color excess @xmath61 due to galactic reddening along the line of sight of each qso was calculated from the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath62 using the relation @xmath63 ( diplas & savage 1994 ) .",

    "the analysis of the emission lines of mjm  10 has been discussed by dewangan et al .",
    "emission lines of other qsos were modeled by gaussian profiles using the iraf task _ ngaussfit_. as a first step , we fitted a single gaussian profile to the strong emission lines .",
    "most of the emission lines are described by a single gaussian profiles , however , the broad wings of the mg  ii lines in the spectra of the qsos mjm  3 , 7 , and 20 are not well fitted by a single gaussian profile .",
    "therefore , the mg  ii line in the spectra of the above qsos were modeled by two gaussian which gave satisfactory fit to the line core as well as to the wings .",

    "<S> in order to study systematically the soft x - ray emission of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at medium to high redshifts , we have analyzed _ rosat _ pspc and hri data of qsos at @xmath0 selected from the second deepest _ rosat _ pspc survey carried out in 1991 - 1993 by mchardy et al .  </S>",

    "<S> our sample of 22 type  1 qsos is nearly complete above a flux limit of @xmath1 in the @xmath2 band . of these , </S>",
    "<S> nine qsos show long term ( @xmath3 ) x - ray variability by a factor of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> significant excess absorption above the galactic column is seen in three qsos . </S>",
    "<S> the soft x - ray photon index of the qsos ranges from @xmath5 to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> three qsos have steep soft x - ray spectra ( @xmath7 ) , one of which is a narrow - line qso  a high luminosity version of narrow - line seyfert  1 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the average photon index ( @xmath8 ) is @xmath9 ( with a dispersion of @xmath10 ) in the @xmath2 band . </S>",
    "<S> the average qso spectra in four redshift bins flatten from an average photon index of @xmath11 at @xmath12 to @xmath13 at @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the flattening of the average photon index can be understood in terms of the redshift effect of the mean intrinsic qso spectrum consisting of two components  a soft x - ray excess and a power - law component . </S>",
