    "during the past few years , there has been renewed interest in the study of heavy quarkonium systems .",
    "much of the recent work on this subject has been stimulated by large discrepancies between old predictions and new observations of psi and upsilon production at several experimental facilities .",
    "orders of magnitude disagreements between theory and data have seriously undermined the conventional `` color - singlet model '' ( csm ) picture of quarkonia formation @xcite . in this model , charmonia and bottomonia mesons are presumed to exclusively originate from short distance processes that create heavy quark - antiquark pairs in colorless configurations .",
    "the quantum numbers of pairs produced in high energy collisions on time scales short compared to @xmath4 are required to precisely match those of the final state hadrons into which they nonperturbatively evolve .",
    "although this csm picture is simple , it does not explain several gross features of recent charmonia and bottomonia data collected at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "it consequently must be abandoned as a complete theory .",
    "a new framework for treating quarkonia systems called nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) has been developed within the past few years @xcite .",
    "this effective field theory generalizes and improves upon the csm in several regards .",
    "it allows for short distance processes to create heavy quark - antiquark pairs in color - octet configurations which can hadronize over much longer length scales into colorless final state quarkonia .",
    "calculations which include this color - octet mechanism appear to successfully describe tevatron measurements @xcite . but",
    "in order to establish the validity of this new paradigm , it is necessary to consider quarkonia production in other experimental situations .",
    "braaten and chen have suggested that a clean signature of the color - octet mechanism may be observable in @xmath2 production at electron - positron colliders @xcite .",
    "these authors have noted that the angular distribution of colored @xmath5 pairs near the endpoint region may qualitatively differ from that of their colorless counterparts .",
    "if this effect could be observed , it would support the color - octet production picture .",
    "it might also permit an independent determination of the numerical values for certain nrqcd matrix elements .    before the search for color - octet quarkonia production in @xmath6 annihilation can begin , one must first know the precise csm prediction . within the nrqcd framework",
    ", the color - singlet cross section is also expected to be quite accurate for all energies except near the endpoint region @xcite . in this note",
    ", we therefore build upon previous studies reported in the literature @xcite and calculate the complete @xmath0 color - singlet cross section for @xmath7 scattering .",
    "we examine the contribution to @xmath2 production from the short distance modes @xmath8+g+g$ ] and @xmath8+q+\\bar{q}$ ] , pair which hadronizes into the final state @xmath2 meson inside square brackets . ] and we derive a closed form expression for the differential cross section .",
    "we then discuss the implications of the csm result for direct @xmath3 observations at cleo .",
    "finally , we compare heavy quark fragmentation predictions with the color - singlet cross section and determine the energy scale at which fragmentation approximations become reliable .",
    "it is useful to note some general features of inclusive , unpolarized @xmath2 production in @xmath6 annihilation .",
    "unitarity , parity and angular momentum considerations restrict the form of the differential cross section expression @xmath9.\\ ] ] in particular , the allowed range for the angular coefficient function is constrained to lie within the interval @xmath10 .",
    "we sketch a derivation of this result below .",
    "it is instructive to consider the subprocess @xmath11 where the intermediate photon is either longitudinally or transversely aligned .",
    "the squared amplitude for this decay @xmath12 involves a form factor @xmath13 which can be decomposed in terms of tensors that respect parity and gauge invariance : @xmath14 working in the @xmath15 rest frame where the @xmath2 four - momentum looks like @xmath16 @xmath17    for a transverse @xmath15 , the squared amplitude takes the form    [ amptran ] @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19    since both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are nonnegative , eqs .",
    "( [ amplong ] ) and ( [ amptran ] ) imply @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "helicity conservation requires the intermediate photon in @xmath1 to be transversely aligned relative to the beam axis in the @xmath24 limit .",
    "the @xmath2 meson s angular distribution is therefore significantly restricted by simple symmetry considerations .",
    "in fact , the inclusive angular distribution of _ any _ unpolarized particle which is produced in electron - positron colliders operating well below the @xmath25-pole goes as @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "so while observation of a pure @xmath28 distribution for a lepton or hadron at a collider like cleo is possible , a pure @xmath29 distribution is not . as we shall see , all color - singlet @xmath2 predictions are consistent with these general considerations .",
    "the simplest parton level process which mediates color - singlet production of @xmath31 quarkonia is given by @xmath32+g+g$ ] .",
    "color , parity and charge conjugation conservation require two gluons to appear in the final state along with the colorless @xmath33 $ ] pair .",
    "this channel consequently contributes to the @xmath2 cross section starting at @xmath0 .",
    "color singlet production also proceeds at the same order in perturbative qcd through the mode @xmath32+q+\\bar{q}$ ] .",
    "these two distinct reactions have been considered separately in the literature @xcite .",
    "we will reexamine their joint impact upon psi and upsilon production and derive a closed form analytic expression for @xmath34 .",
    "we can then compare the relative magnitudes of the gluon and quark processes as a function of center - of - mass energy  @xmath35 .",
    "the leading order diagrams which mediate @xmath36(p_3)+g(p_4)+g(p_5)$ ] and @xmath36(p_3)+q(p_4)+\\bar{q}(p_5)$ ] scattering are illustrated in figs .  1 and  2 . the hard collisions pictured in the figures form on short time scales a heavy quark and antiquark which fly out from the primary interaction point in nearly parallel directions and almost on - shell .",
    "the @xmath5 pair then evolves over a much longer time interval into a physical @xmath2 bound state .",
    "working within the nrqcd framework and using computational methods discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , one can straightforwardly calculate the amplitudes for these processes .",
    "their squares factorize into products of short distance coefficient functions and long distance nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "= 6truecm    = 11truecm    integrating the squared amplitudes over the three particle phase space factor @xmath37 is somewhat involved . as a simplifying measure ,",
    "we rescale all dimensionful quantities relative to the beam energy @xmath38 and work with the dimensionless variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the phase space factor for the reaction with gluons in the final state can then be reduced to the form @xmath43 where    [ phasespacevariables ] @xmath44    the same result holds for the quark process with the simple alteration @xmath45 .",
    "the available phase space volume clearly depends upon the masses of the final state bodies .",
    "for the @xmath8+g+g$ ] channel , the limits of integration for the remaining energy and angular variables in eq .",
    "( [ simplephasespace ] ) are given by    [ phasespacelimits ] @xmath46    the corresponding limits for the @xmath32+q+\\bar{q}$ ] mode    [ heavyphasespacelimits ] @xmath47    are more tight due to the additional heavy quark and antiquark in the final state .",
    "after inserting the averaged squared amplitudes and reduced phase space factors into the formula @xmath48 we can analytically integrate over @xmath49 and @xmath50 and obtain differential expressions of the form ( [ generalcrosssection ] ) .",
    "we display the resulting @xmath51 and @xmath52 functions for the @xmath53+g+g$ ] and @xmath53+q+\\bar{q}$ ] processes in the appendix . as a check",
    ", one can verify that @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not exceed unity within their allowed @xmath56 ranges as required by the general constraints discussed in section ii .",
    "the total @xmath0 angular coefficient function @xmath57 also respects the bound @xmath58 .",
    "another important check can be performed by considering the high energy behavior of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 functions . in the @xmath59 limit",
    ", the color - singlet cross section reduces to @xmath60\\\\ & & \\times   \\frac{z_3(1-z_3)^2(16 - 32 z_3 + 72 z_3 ^ 2 - 32 z_3 ^ 3 + 5 z_3 ^ 4 ) } { ( 2-z_3)^6}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after integrating over @xmath61 and recalling the relation @xmath62 between the color - singlet nrqcd matrix element and the @xmath2 wavefunction at the origin @xcite , we can write the @xmath2 energy distribution as @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the heavy quark fragmentation function calculated in ref .  @xcite . the complete @xmath0 color - singlet cross section",
    "thus correctly reproduces known fragmentation results at high energies .",
    "@xmath3 production is currently under study at cleo@xcite .",
    "charmonia observed at this @xmath6 facility mainly come from @xmath66 meson decays .",
    "however , a clean sample of @xmath67 s originating from continuum production can be obtained by imposing a lower momentum cut on their dilepton decay products .",
    "various characteristics of the resulting direct @xmath3 data sample can then be compared with predictions based upon color - singlet and color - octet production mechanisms .",
    "such experimental investigations are underway@xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of direct @xmath3 mesons represents one observable which can be measured at cleo . in fig .  3",
    ", we plot the csm prediction for the angular coefficient function @xmath68 .",
    "the results displayed in the figure are based upon the input parameter values @xmath69 gev , @xmath70 gev , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the dashed curve illustrates the function @xmath75 associated with @xmath76+g+g$ ] scattering .",
    "the shape of this curve agrees with numerical results of driesen _ et al . _",
    "reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . the dotted line in fig .  3",
    "depicts the function @xmath77 originating from the @xmath76+c+\\bar{c}$ ] mode .",
    "the shape of @xmath77 is clearly quite different than that of @xmath75 .",
    "but since @xmath78 is substantially smaller than @xmath79 at cleo energies , it has only a small impact upon the total color - singlet function @xmath80 which is represented by the solid curve in fig .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath80 is predicted within the csm to be negative at the largest allowed values for @xmath56 . on the other hand",
    ", color - octet effects may render @xmath80 positive in the endpoint region @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of the most energetic @xmath3 s at cleo can therefore provide a valuable test of the color - octet mechanism .",
    "the energy distribution of direct @xmath3 s is another quantity which can be used to probe theories of quarkonia production . in fig .  4",
    ", we display the separate contributions to @xmath81 from the @xmath76+g+g$ ] and @xmath76+c+\\bar{c}$ ] channels along with the total csm prediction .",
    "the sensitivity of this energy observable to the charm mode is more pronounced than that of the angular coefficient function .",
    "the areas underneath the dashed , dotted and solid curves respectively equal @xmath82 pb , @xmath83 pb and @xmath84 pb . the quark process thus contributes at the 10% level to direct @xmath3 production at cleo .    the @xmath76+c+\\bar{c}$ ] mode is significantly phase space suppressed compared to @xmath76+g+g$ ] at cleo energies . as a result ,",
    "its impact upon charmonia observables is minor .",
    "however , it is interesting to examine the relative importance of these two color - singlet channels as a function of center - of - mass energy .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "5 the modes separate contributions to the integrated @xmath3 cross section along with their sum versus @xmath85 .",
    "we also display the integral of the charm quark fragmentation approximation ( [ frag ] ) . at low energies ,",
    "the charm quark mode is negligible compared to its gluon counterpart .        as can be seen in fig .  5 ,",
    "the charm quark fragmentation curve rapidly asymptotes to the @xmath76+c+\\bar{c}$ ] cross section .",
    "but it is important to note that the crossover point at which the rates for the charm and gluon modes become equal occurs around @xmath87 gev .",
    "consequently , the fragmentation approximation does _ not _ accurately reflect the total color - singlet cross section until @xmath35 exceeds @xmath88 by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this result for @xmath3 production at lepton colliders is quite different than that for hadron accelerators .",
    "previous investigations have found that fragmentation approximations are reasonably trustworthy for production of @xmath67 s at the tevatron with @xmath89 gev @xcite .",
    "the moral we thus draw from this study of charmonia at cleo is that the validity of fragmentation predictions must be carefully checked on a case - by - case basis .",
