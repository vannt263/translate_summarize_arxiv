    "<S> we report the measurement of the parity violating single spin asymmetries for inclusive high transverse momentum electrons and positrons in polarized @xmath0 collisions at a center of mass energy of @xmath1 gev with the phenix detector at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons are attributed to the decay of @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons , and measured production cross section is consistent with the expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 production is confirmed for the first time in @xmath0 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> its spin asymmetry in the polarized @xmath0 collisions is a important probe for the quark flavor decomposition of the proton spin .    </S>",
    "<S> the proton is the most basic composite particle . </S>",

    "<S> deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiment has been a clear and powerful approach and it is evolved to polarized dis experiment to explore the spin structure of the proton . </S>",
    "<S> analyses of polarized semi - inclusive dis experiments  @xcite have determined the individual flavor separated quark and antiquark helicity distribution ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) by connecting final state hadrons with quark flavors using fragmentation functions . colliding polarized protons </S>",
    "<S> is a complementary way to approach the origin of the proton spin . at the collider energy , the real @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> is produced via a parity violating weak process , which enables to identify the quark flavor and helicity in the proton contributed to the process by detecting decay leptons without the uncertainty of fragmentation functions . </S>",
    "<S> another advantage is , because the scale is set by the heavy mass of the @xmath4 , higher order qcd corrections can be evaluated reliably .    in 2009 , </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) succeeded to collide polarized protons at a center of mass energy of @xmath1 gev . in this report </S>",

    "<S> this analysis uses the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emcal ) to measure the energy of electrons and tracking chambers , the drift chambers ( dc ) and the pad chambers ( pc ) , to determine the charge sign of the tracks from their bend angle in an axial magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the data set was recorded with the emcal trigger which has a nominal energy threshold at 10 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity is monitored by beam - beam counters , those are two arrays of 64 quartz erenkov counters located at 3.1@xmath83.9 . </S>",

    "<S> the electron has high transverse momentum ( @xmath10 ) and it is isolated unlike high @xmath10 track in qcd jet events . </S>",
    "<S> the electron energy measured in the emcal was used to calculate the @xmath10 . because for electrons at momentum of 40gev/@xmath11 of our interest , the resolution of the energy in the emcal is about 5% and it is better than the resolution of the momentum of about 40% . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : alphapt ] shows the relation between the bend angle , @xmath12 , and the transverse momentum for charged tracks after a rough electron selection . </S>",

    "<S> the ratio of two gaussian distribution is set to the expected signal ratio of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ]    to select electron track candidates we applied two levels of criteria . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is a minimal track criteria which requires the projected point to the beam to be less than 30 cm , loose cuts on the time of flight , and rough energy - momentum matching . </S>",
    "<S> this criteria was used to calculate the production cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the second one requires the electron track to be isolated . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold was set to the sum of energy and momentum in the cone around the electron candidate track at 2 gev . </S>",

    "<S> the tracks within the nominal geometric acceptance of the central spectrometer were reconstructed with @xmath1837% efficiency defined by the overlap of live areas in the tracking detectors , and fiducial areas on the calorimeters and drift chambers . </S>",

    "<S> when a polarized beam collides with a unpolarized beam , the raw parity violating single spin asymmetry is defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of events from collisions with the beam polarization is positive , and @xmath28 for the negative . </S>",
    "<S> generally the integrated luminosities are not equal in the two cases , the relative luminosity , @xmath29 , is to adjust the difference . </S>",
    "<S> the physics asymmetry is calculated from the raw asymmetry according to @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the beam polarization and @xmath32 is a dilution correction to account for the remaining background in the signal region .    in reality , rhic has two polarized beams . since the measurement in the central arm spectrometer is symmetric to the beams , both beams contribute equally . </S>",
