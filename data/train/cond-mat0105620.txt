    "bilayer quantum hall systems at landau level filling factor @xmath0 have broken symmetry ground states that can be regarded either as easy plane ferromagnets or as excitonic superfluids and have been extensively studied over the past decade  @xcite .",
    "bilayer two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems consist of a pair of 2d electron gases separated by a distance @xmath1 ( @xmath2 100  ) which is comparable to the typical distance between electrons within each layer . when a strong magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the electron layers , the quantum hall regime , in which macroscopic landau level degeneracy quenches the kinetic energy and enhances the role of interactions in determining physical properties ,",
    "is reached .",
    "bilayer quantum hall systems exhibit a rich variety of broken symmetry states  @xcite depending on landau level filling factor and on the relative importance of interlayer and intralayer coulomb interactions . for filling factor @xmath0 ,",
    "the ground state is completely spin polarized and spin excitations are gapped because of zeeman coupling of the electron spins to the ( strong ) magnetic field , justifying the neglect of quantum spin dynamics .",
    "the only remaining degrees of freedom are the intra - landau level cyclotron orbit centers and the discrete layer index which can be treated as a pseudospin label with `` up '' denoting a state localized in the upper layer and `` down '' denoting a state localized in the lower layer . at _",
    "total _ filling factor @xmath0 this system s ground state has _ spontaneous _",
    "interlayer phase coherence ( easy - plane ferromagnetism in the pseudospin language ) , and is incompressible  @xcite .",
    "since each layer has filling factor @xmath3 , a compressible - state filling factor for isolated layers , this quantum hall effect is entirely due to correlations between the two layers .",
    "the system undergoes a phase transition at a critical layer separation @xmath4 from this incompressible qhe state with pseudospin ferromagnetism to a disordered compressible state  @xcite , possibly with other more exotic intervening states  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a theory of quantum fluctuations about the hartree - fock mean - field - theory ordered ground state of the @xmath0 bilayer .",
    "our theory is based on an approximate expression for the ground state energy which includes quantum fluctuations and generalizes the random phase approximation to cases when both direct and exchange interactions are important .",
    "the ground state energy itself is of little direct physical relevance , however our approach is sufficiently flexible so that we can evaluate the dependence of the ground state energy on external fields and the winding wavevector of spiral states , to obtain quantities of physical interest .",
    "the most important macroscopic parameters characterizing order in quantum hall bilayer pseudospin ferromagnets are the total pseudospin polarization and the pseudospin stiffness @xmath5 , which characterizes the energetic cost of long wavelength fluctuations of the pseudospin field . in mean - field theory , all electrons occupy symmetric bilayer states , which corresponds to having all pseudospins polarized along the positive @xmath6-axis",
    ". we will use the pseudospin polarization normalized to its mean field value as a dimensionless order parameter , @xmath7 , which we will determine by evaluating the dependence of ground state energy on interlayer tunneling amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "the pseudospin stiffness will be determined by evaluating fluctuation corrections to the energy of spiral states , in which the pseudospin orientation varies spatially at a constant rate .    at a formal level",
    ", the calculations described in this paper can be adopted to describe the influence of quantum fluctuations on the ground state of any easy - plane itinerant electron ferromagnet or any superconductor . in the case of a superconductor , the analog of the pseudospin stiffness",
    "is the superfluid density .",
    "the present work is motivated in part by an interest in applications to these more general problems .",
    "the bilayer quantum hall system is an ideal test case , both because its translational invariance permits many elements of the calculations to be performed analytically , and because the importance of quantum fluctuations in the ground state can be adjusted over a large range simply by adjusting the interlayer spacing . for zero layer separation ,",
    "the bilayer systems is equivalent to a single - layer system with a spin degree of freedom and a zeeman coupling @xmath9 that plays the same role as the tunneling amplitude @xmath8 in spin - polarized bilayer systems . in the @xmath10 limit",
    ", the mean - field ground state is exact@xcite because the interaction term in the hamiltonian is pseudospin invariant . at finite @xmath1",
    ", the difference between the intralayer coulomb interaction , @xmath11 and the interlayer coulomb interaction @xmath12 reduces the interaction term s symmetry from su(2 ) to u(1 ) .",
    "because of this reduced symmetry , only the @xmath13 component of the total pseudospin polarization commutes with the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "hence , even though the mean - field - theory splitting between symmetric and antisymmetric single - particle state energies is enhanced by interactions , a fully pseudospin - polarized state can not be an eigenstate of the microscopic hamiltonian and in particular , can not be the ground state . in the description we use ,",
    "the ground state many - body wavefunction is a linear combination of states with collective excitations embedded in the fully - polarized hartree - fock mean - field ground state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : affia ]",
    "we describe the functional integral approach to this problem .",
    "it is known that in these systems , both electrostatic _ and _ exchange fluctuations are essential to the collective mode physics  @xcite , with the former dominating the cost of @xmath13-direction pseudospin fluctuations and the latter controlling the easy - plane pseudospin stiffness .",
    "this situation contrasts with that of metallic ferromagnets in which exchange interactions alone determine the collective mode behavior .",
    "no standard hubbard stratonovich ( hs ) transformation treatment  @xcite can deal with both simultaneously .",
    "section  [ sec : affia ] formally summarizes the generalized hubbard - stratonovich we employ that treats direct and exchange channels on an equal footing , and establishes some of the notation we will use .",
    "our approach is based on one developed previously by kerman _",
    "et al._@xcite section  [ sec : grpa ] formally summarizes the generalized random phase approximation ( grpa ) for particle - hole correlation functions and its relationship to the generalized hs transformation . in section  [ sec : adls ] we apply our formalism to a double layer system at filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the dispersion of collective modes , their contribution to the grand potential , and the effect of fluctuations on the pseudospin polarization and pseudospin stiffness .",
    "we conclude the paper with discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in bilayer quantum hall systems , due to the difference between interlayer and intralayer coulomb interaction , there is a capacitive energy cost associated with charge - imbalance between the two layers .",
    "this anisotropy of the coulomb interaction in pseudospin - space makes it necessary to treat the fluctuations in direct and exchange channels on an equal footing .",
    "a general way to take into account such fluctuations is the hubbard stratonovich transformation  @xcite . in this approach",
    ", we introduce an integral over a bose field @xmath14 which converts the fermionic two - body interaction in the original hamiltonian into a one - body term coupled with the field @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then quadratic in the fermion operators so that the trace over these degrees of freedom can be evaluated exactly to obtain an effective action for the bose field .",
    "stationary phase approximations to the bosonic action yield mean - field theories . the nature of the mean - field state , for example whether it is characterized by a hartree mean - field , an exchange mean - field , or a pairing mean - field depends upon the way the hubbard stratonovich transformation is done .",
    "the nature of the collective excitations that emerge when gaussian fluctuations are allowed in the boson field also change qualitatively .",
    "for example fluctuations in the hartree mean - field reveal plasmon collective modes , and fluctuations in the exchange mean - field of a ferromagnet reveal spin - wave collective modes . for a bilayer system , where the collective mode properties are determined by fluctuations in both channels ,",
    "we need a method which treats both hartree and exchange mean - fields on an equal footing .",
    "it is known that the standard hs transformation does _ not _ yield a hartree fock mean - field state and can not capture _ both _ hartree and the exchange fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "kerman , levit , and troudet have presented a generalization of the hs transformation which overcomes these limitations  @xcite . to establish our notation ( which differs from that of kerman _",
    "_ ) , we briefly review the previous work which describes an approach for obtaining systematic corrections to hartree - fock mean - field approximations for the grand potential .",
    "our approach can also be used to systematically improve upon hartree - fock mean - field approximations for the one - particle green s function  @xcite .",

    "this means we are treating the collective modes as non - interacting bosons . if we were to go beyond the gaussian approximation and",
    "include higher - order fluctuations , they would generate interactions between these collective modes , which are certainly important as the layer separation approaches critical layer separation , @xmath191 .",
