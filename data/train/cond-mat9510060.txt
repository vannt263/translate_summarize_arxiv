    "consider a fluid system close to a critical point , for example a fluid near the liquid - gas critical point , a binary liquid near the consolute point , or liquid @xmath7 near the @xmath8point . due to the long correlation length a local perturbation , as provided by the wall of the container or by the surfaces of immersed colloid particles ,",
    "is not screened within a few atomic layers but influences the system over appreciable distances .",
    "this gives rise to a long - range interaction between immersed particles or a particle and a wall , as pointed out by fisher and de gennes @xcite .",
    "the forces may be termed critical casimir forces @xcite on account of the close formal relationship with the usual casimir forces @xcite due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "an interesting feature of the critical casimir effect is that it can be turned on and off by changing the magnitude of the correlation length , e.g. by changing the temperature .",
    "the simplest and most - considered geometry for the critical ( as well as the electromagnetic ) casimir effect is the parallel - plate geometry .",
    "results have been obtained in spatial dimensions @xmath9 by using conformal invariance @xcite and in @xmath10 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider _ spherical boundary surfaces _ ,",
    "i.e. spheres immersed in a critical fluid .",
    "many of the general model - independent properties for this geometry are also discussed in a recent letter by burkhardt and one of the present authors @xcite .",
    "the spherical shape is of immediate relevance for colloidal particles @xcite , and besides the planar boundary it is the simplest boundary shape for theoretical analyses .",
    "the reason is that systems right at the critical point display an invariance not only with respect to homogenous dilatations but also with respect to conformal or angle - preserving coordinate transformations @xcite .",
    "the class of special conformal transformations @xcite which exists in arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath6 maps spheres onto spheres .",
    "this has been used to study the critical properties of an infinite system with a single spherical hole ( particle ) and of a finite system with a spherical boundary by conformally mapping results for the half ",
    "space @xcite .    an infinite system with _ two _ arbitrary non - overlapping spherical holes ( particles )",
    "may be obtained by conformally mapping a highly symmetric finite system which is bounded by two concentric spheres @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1 and follows from the special conformal transformation @xmath11 which maps the sphere of radius @xmath12 centered at the origin of @xmath13-space onto a plane in @xmath14-space that is perpendicular to @xmath15 and passes through the origin .",
    "two spheres with fixed radii @xmath16 , @xmath1 centered about the origin of @xmath17-space ( and depicted in fig .",

    "the points of intersection @xmath19 with the @xmath20-axis have the coordinates @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "two cases of particular interest will be studied in detail below :    * for @xmath23 , the _ two spheres _ in @xmath24-space have _ equal size _ ( ses ) , since @xmath25 and @xmath26 . * for @xmath27 , the left sphere reduces to a plane through the origin , which is denoted by a broken line in fig .",

    "for @xmath34 the order is @xmath35 , and sphere @xmath32 is located outside sphere @xmath33 .",
    "an important parameter of the two - sphere geometry is the _ cross ratio _ of intersection points , which remains invariant under conformal transformations @xcite .",
    "instead of working directly with the cross ratio , it is convenient to introduce the related invariant quantity @xmath36 which can be written as @xmath37 in either of the above geometries . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath38 are the radii of spheres @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , and @xmath39 is the distance between their centers . on comparing with the concentric geometry of fig .  1a , where @xmath40 and where @xmath41 and @xmath38 have been denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively",
    ", one finds from ( [ kap2 ] ) @xmath42 with @xmath43 one can also obtain ( [ kap3 ] ) by inserting ( [ inte ] ) into ( [ kapp ] ) , which demonstrates the conformal invariance of @xmath44 since the parameter @xmath12 of ( [ cotr ] ) drops out .",
    "it follows from ( [ kapp ] ) or ( [ kap2 ] ) that @xmath45 corresponds to two particles that touch , while @xmath46 describes the situation where one or both of the radii @xmath47 are much smaller than the remaining lengths in the two - sphere configuration .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the free energy .",
    "for two non - overlapping spherical particles in an infinite critical medium we consider @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the singular part @xcite of the free energy for immersing two particles into an infinitely extended fluid , while @xmath50 is that for immersing a single particle .",

    "this expression vanishes as @xmath38 tends to infinity with @xmath28 and @xmath39 fixed .",
    "right at the bulk critical point the quantities @xmath51 are invariant under special conformal transformations @xcite and can only depend on the conformal invariant @xmath44 in ( [ kap2 ] ) : @xmath60 it follows from the above arguments that @xmath51 for two particles in the infinite critical liquid and @xmath51 for the single particle in the spherically confined liquid both obey ( [ delf ] ) with the same function @xmath61 .",

    "the concentric geometry is especially convenient for the explicit evaluation of the universal scaling function @xmath61 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath2 depends on both the bulk universality class @xcite and the surface universality classes @xmath68 @xcite of the critical system . for a liquid - gas critical point or a critical consolute point of a binary mixture , @xmath32 and @xmath33 correspond to the ising model with surface magnetic fields @xcite either parallel @xmath69 or antiparallel @xmath70 depending on whether the two surfaces favor the same or different signs of the order parameter .",
    "liquid @xmath71he at the @xmath8point belongs to the bulk universality class of the @xmath72 model , and surfaces are expected to suppress the superfluid order @xcite , corresponding to the surface universality class @xmath73 of the ` ordinary transition ' @xcite .",
