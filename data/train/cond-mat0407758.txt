    "probabilistic techniques , as the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithms , provide an essential tool to investigate the properties of many - body systems .",
    "basically , with these techniques one evaluates functions of matrices by a random walk in the space of the matrix indices @xcite .",
    "given the hamiltonian @xmath0 of the system , the idea is to find an appropriate stochastic representation of the imaginary time evolution operator @xmath1 applied to some initial trial state . by using these methods ,",
    "one can obtain , at least in the absence of a sign problem , the ground - state properties with a numerical effort that grows with some power of the size @xmath2 of the system . on the other hand",
    ", the exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian would imply an effort exponentially growing with @xmath2 .    from a more physical point of view",
    ", a probabilistic representation provides a dual picture of the quantum systems : on one hand , the traditional description in terms of bra , ket and operators , on the other hand , a description in terms of expectations of suitable stochastic functionals , which are averages over virtual trajectories of the particles .",
    "it is this mapping with a ( in a sense ) classical system that allows us to extract quantum information by statistical simulations .    in recent years",
    ", it has been proved that the dynamics of a system of quantum particles on a lattice admits an exact probabilistic representation @xcite .",
    "a suitable stochastic functional @xmath3 , which is defined in terms of a collection of independent poisson processes and diffuses from a fock state @xmath4 to a fock state @xmath5 , has the property that the expectation value @xmath6 , taken with respect to the poisson processes , gives the matrix element of @xmath7 between the two fock states @xmath4 and @xmath8 . in the theory of stochastic processes",
    ", this probabilistic representation may be regarded as the lattice version of the feynman - kac formula .",
    "we emphasize that in this method no approximation is introduced and no `` infinity path integral extrapolation '' is requested .",
    "it will be referred to as the exact probabilistic representation ( epr ) of the evolution operator @xmath7 .",
    "the validity of epr is not limited to hamiltonian systems : it can be used to express any imaginary- or real - time evolution operator @xmath7 having any finite matrix @xmath0 as generator .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we used epr to obtain semi - analytical results in the limit @xmath9 , in which a central limit theorem applies . in this paper",
    ", we consider epr at arbitrary times within a monte carlo approach ( eprmc ) .",
    "two other well known qmc algorithms , namely the path integrals monte carlo method ( pimc ) and the green function monte carlo method ( gfmc ) , have affinities with eprmc and a comparison is mandatory .    in pimc ,",
    "one evaluates the matrix elements of @xmath7 by using the trotter approximation @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath7 is factorized in the kinetic , @xmath10 , and interaction , @xmath11 , terms so that one gets @xmath12t^2/n^{2})$ ] .",
    "this approximation leads to a feynman - kac formula , in which , as in eprmc , the trajectories in the fock space are generated only by the kinetic part , @xmath13 .",
    "however , in contrast to eprmc , there are no stochastic times related to poisson processes .",
    "the pimc simulations are performed by evolving the trajectories for @xmath14 steps .",
    "the drawback is that to obtain results corresponding to @xmath15 , in which the trotter approximation becomes exact , one must use extrapolation procedures .",
    "for any finite value of @xmath14 , the extrapolation becomes unreliable for values of @xmath16 sufficiently large .",
    "this is particularly evident in the case of real times ( @xmath17 ) , when the matrix elements of @xmath18 have an oscillating behavior with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , no small step approximation is introduced in eprmc and no extrapolation is requested .",
    "now , let us consider gfmc .",
    "the method consists in repeated statistical applications of the operator @xmath19 to an initial state . for @xmath20 ,",
    "one reproduces the operator @xmath7 , whereas an approximation affected by a relative error @xmath21 is obtained for any finite @xmath14 .",
    "it is plausible that the sampling directly the operator @xmath7 instead of @xmath22 leads to a higher efficiency . in the appendix",
    ", we show that the relative efficiency between eprmc and gfmc in filtering the ground state is @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the energies of the ground- and first - excited states of the considered system and @xmath26 is the ground - state energy of the associated non interacting system . since the gap @xmath27 decreases as the size @xmath2 of the system is increased , compared to gfmc , eprmc offers a more powerful method to investigate the ground - state properties of large lattice systems .    actually , the gfmc scheme mentioned above is rather crude .",
    "trivedi and ceperley @xcite introduced poisson processes as a tool to obtain a more efficient gfmc method when the transition probabilities , proportional to the matrix elements of @xmath28 , vanish for @xmath29 .",
    "we will refer to this improved gfmc as gfmcp . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been proved that in the limit @xmath29 gfmcp becomes equivalent to eprmc .",
    "however , as explained in the appendix , for a finite value of @xmath14 the relative efficiency of eprmc with respect to gfmcp is @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ it is proportional to the accuracy @xmath31 required in the approximated gfmcp .",
    "controlling the large fluctuations is one of the most important issues of any monte carlo method .",
    "this is evident in gfmc where an iterated statistical application of the operator @xmath19 is performed . roughly speaking , after @xmath32 iterations one has fluctuations that grow like @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the statistical error associated to a single step . to solve the problem of large fluctuations , besides the development of the importance sampling method @xcite , remarkable progress has been made with the reconfiguration technique introduced by hetherington @xcite and subsequently improved by sorella @xcite who proposed a scheme without bias ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper , after introducing some relevant physical models ( section [ models ] ) and recalling epr ( section [ probabilistic representation ] ) , we extend epr to the study of exact time - dependent correlation functions ( section [ correlation functions ] ) . in the core section [ eprmc algorithm ] ,",
    "we discuss the eprmc algorithm first with a pure sampling and then adding fluctuation control by reconfigurations and importance sampling . a detailed proof of the validity of the reconfiguration method",
    "is given in section [ proof of the reconfiguration method ] .",
    "results of numerical simulations for the hard - core boson hubbard model and for the heisenberg model are discussed in section [ numerical results ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the hamiltonian models of interest have the following general structure ( we shall always take @xmath35 ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the potential energy operator and @xmath38 the kinetic energy operator , which on a lattice assumes the form @xmath39 here @xmath40 is a finite @xmath41-dimensional lattice with @xmath42 ordered sites and @xmath43 the commuting or anticommuting destruction operators at site @xmath44 and spin index @xmath45 with the property @xmath46 ( fermion or hard - core boson systems ) .",
    "the system is described in terms of fock states labeled by the configuration @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _ the set of lattice occupation numbers taking the values 0 or 1 .",
    "the total number of particles is @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "we shall use the mod 2 addition @xmath50 .",
    "the analysis we develop in the following is valid for an arbitrary functional form of the potential @xmath51 .",
    "however , numerical examples will be limited to the well known hubbard potential @xcite @xmath52 we emphasize that , independently of its form , @xmath53 is diagonal in the fock space , whereas @xmath38 is off diagonal .",
    "in this paper we will consider only hard - core boson systems .",
    "we recall that , even if fermion systems , like the hubbard model , are more attractive , hard - core bosons have not a purely academic interest . besides the description of boson particles with a hard - core interaction ,",
    "they can be mapped onto systems of half integer spin @xcite . as an example",
    ", we consider the @xmath54 heisenberg quantum antiferromagnetic model @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 indicates that the sites @xmath44 and @xmath58 are nearest neighbors , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the spin operators .",
    "it is convenient to view the left and right factors in @xmath61 as the spin operators of two sublattices a and b , respectively . the mapping is then established as follows .",
    "the operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 commute on different sites and are thus identified with boson operators via @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore as @xmath66 , one has @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the number operator . for a half spin system @xmath69 , which implies @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the bosons have a hard core and a site can be occupied by at most one particle . in order to a",
    "have negative sign in the kinetic energy term , a further transformation is necessary .",
    "the spins on the sublattice b are rotated as @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . since",
    "this transformation is unitary , the commutation relations are left unchanged .",
    "the hard - core boson hamiltonian then reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 being the number of nearest neighbors for the given lattice , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath77 for a square lattice in two dimensions .",

    "the number of steps needed in eprmc to sample @xmath456 for @xmath16 large is given by the average number of jumps that , when an optimal reconfiguration scheme is chosen as discussed in section [ numerical results ] , coincides with the number of reconfigurations @xmath471 @xmath472 where @xmath357 is the average number of active links and @xmath473 is the ground - state energy in the non - interacting case .",
    "therefore , the relative efficiency of eprmc with respect to gfmc is given by the ratio @xmath474 we see that the superiority of eprmc grows by increasing the time @xmath16 or increasing the accuracy @xmath31 required in gfmc .",

    "in fact , any step in gfmcp , on the average , amounts to @xmath477 elementary gfmc steps , where roughly @xmath478 @xcite .",
    "thus , in gfmcp the number of steps needed to sample the operator @xmath456 for @xmath16 large with a relative error @xmath455 is reduced to @xmath479 so that the relative efficiency of eprmc with respect to gfmcp is given by the ratio @xmath480 this ratio does not depend on @xmath16 anymore but remains proportional to the accuracy required in gfmcp .",
