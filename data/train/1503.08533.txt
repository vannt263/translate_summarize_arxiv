    "this decrease in resource consumption generally comes at the expense of a lower success probability .",
    "furthermore , pati @xcite has argued that rsp is able to maintain its low resource consumption while meeting the success probability of qt for preparing special ensemble states ( e.g. , states existing on the equator and great polar circle of the bloch sphere ) .",
    "characterized by conservation of resources while maintaining high total success probability ( tsp ) , it is not surprising that rsp has recently received much attention within the literature .    to date",

    "it has been previously shown that non - maximally - entangled states are general cases and are more achievable in real - world laboratory conditions .",
    "in contrast , maximally - entangled states are a special case of general entangled states when the state coefficients are restricted to special values . therefore , our scheme is a readily general procedure .",
    "additionally , @xcite investigated deterministic rsp for both the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 cases ; however , there are some differences between these schemes and the analogous cases within our works : first , @xcite concentrated only on the cases when maximally entangled states are taken as channels ; this limit is just a special case of our schemes where the channels are general , yet still allow for the maximally - entangled case .",
    "second , we employ a von neumann projective measurement in a set of vectors @xmath112 instead of measurement on the basis of @xmath96 and hadamard transformations . considering these differences , we argue that our scheme is more general than previous works , and we reduce both the number and complexity of operations in the overall procedure .",
    "in summary , we have derived a novel strategy for the implementation of rsp of a general @xmath0-qubit entangled state .",
    "this was done by taking advantage of robust ghz - type states acting as quantum channels . with the assistance of appropriate local operations and classical communication ,",
    "the schemes can be realized with high success probabilities , increased four - fold and eight - fold when compared to previous schemes with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively @xcite .",
    "remarkably , our schemes feature several nontrivial properties , including a high success probability , reducibility and generalizability .",
    "moreover , the tsp of rsp can reach unity when the quantum channels are reduced to maximally - entangled states ; that is , our schemes become deterministic at such a limit .",
    "further , we argue that our current rsp proposal might be important for applications in long - distance quantum communication using prospective node - node quantum networks .",
    "* appendix * + within this appendix , we shall provide a second illustration of the procedure featured in section [ section:2 ] of the main text .",
    "we have provided this example to assist in comparisons between two values of @xmath0 for the rsp of an arbitrary @xmath0-qubit entangled state .",

    ", the procedure can be implemented in a manner consistent with the five - step procedure in the main text :    * step 1 : * alice performs a three - qubit projective measurement on the qubit triplet ( @xmath118 ) under a set of complete orthogonal basis vectors : @xmath119 @xmath120 ; where @xmath119 is comprised of this computational basis : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "this measurement takes the form : @xmath129 where the projection operator , @xmath20 , is of the form : @xmath130 thus , the total systemic state , encompassing the quantum channels , reads as : @xmath131 within the above , the states @xmath132 are non - normalized ; @xmath133 are the normalized coefficients associated with the states @xmath132 and the non - normalized state @xmath134 can be obtained with a probability of @xmath135 .",
    "* step 2 : * in accordance with the measurement outcome @xmath136 , alice makes an appropriate triplet joint unitary operation , @xmath137 , on her remaining three qubits : 2 , 5 and 8 .",
