    "single molecule electronic devices , like molecular transistors , are being extensively studied because they offer perspectives for further miniaturization of electronic circuits with important potential applications.@xcite in addition , they provide realizations of fundamental issues in condensed matter physics .",
    "examples are the spin-1/2 @xcite and spin-1 @xcite kondo effect , which lead to an increased conductance at low temperatures with different behaviors . in c@xmath7 quantum dots , quantum phase transitions involving partially kondo screened spin-1 molecular states were induced changing the gate voltage.roch,serge these experiments could be explained semiquantitatively using extensions of the impurity anderson model treated with either the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite or with the non - crossing approximation ( nca).@xcite this approximation allows calculations out of equilibrium and in particular at finite bias voltage . while these calculations did not include phonons , the latter are known to play an important role for molecular transistors under suitable conditions.@xcite for example ( as a rather special case ) , evidence for a coupling between the center - of - mass motion of the c@xmath7 molecules with the hopping to the leads was found in a single - c@xmath7 transistor with gold leads.@xcite phonon effects were also observed in other systems .",

    "_ , found that the kondo temperature @xmath10 depends weakly on the applied gate voltage and shows a rapid increase only close to the charge degeneracy points.@xcite such behavior is inconsistent with the usual theory based on the impurity anderson model , but could be explained using the anderson - holstein model,@xcite which is an extension of the former to include a single phonon mode coupled linearly with the charge in the molecule . at equilibrium ( @xmath11 ) , the anderson - holstein model has been studied with nrg,@xcite monte carlo @xcite , a mean - field approach,@xcite nca decoupling phonons,@xcite an interpolative perturbative approach,@xcite and the equation - of - motion ( eom ) method.@xcite    for finite bias voltage @xmath9 , the interplay of kondo and vibrations has been studied using a real - time diagrammatic technique,@xcite functional renormalizaton group after a schriefer - wolf transformation,@xcite eom decoupling phonons,@xcite imaginary time quantum monte carlo plus analytical continuation,@xcite and nca decoupling phonons,@xcite .",

    "a problem with this decoupling is that for a fixed renormalized localized level @xmath2 , predicts that the kondo temperature changes exponentially with the electron - phonon coupling @xmath0 , which is actually not the case.@xcite    in this work we extend the nca as applied to the infinite @xmath12 limit of the anderson model,@xcite to include explicitly the effect of the phonons . for the case of one doublet , comparison of nca with nrg results,@xcite",

    "the leading behavior of the differential conductance for small voltage and temperature @xcite agrees with alternative fermi liquid approaches,@xcite and the temperature dependence of the conductance practically coincides with the nrg result over several decades of temperature.@xcite a shortcoming of the nca is",
    "that , at very low temperatures , it introduces an artificial spike at the fermi energy in the spectral density when the ground state of the system without coupling to the leads is non - degenerate , although the thermodynamic properties continue to be well described.@xcite another limitation of the method is that it is restricted to temperatures above @xmath13 , where @xmath10 is the kondo temperature .",
    "an advantage of the method over the eom is that it is a conserving approximation and gives the right exponential dependence of @xmath10 on the energy of the localized state @xmath14 , while the eom has a factor of the order of 1 in the exponent.@xcite while the nrg is more accurate at low energies , the nca has a comparative advantage that it can be extended rather easily to non - equilibrium situations .",

    "now we obtain a nice monotonic decrease of @xmath1 with @xmath0 as expected .",
    "also the occupancy of the localized level ( not shown ) has now a monotonic increase with @xmath0 from 0.79 for @xmath30 to 0.87 for @xmath198 .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the narrowing of the charge - transfer peak is complicated by the presence of the side kondo peaks and is beyond the scope of the present work . in any case",

    "although an exponential renormalization factor is a common feature of strongly coupled electron - phonon couplings , as stressed by hewson and mayer , the exponential reduction does not in general occur in the strong - coupling regime of the model , but only in a certain parameter regime.@xcite       for @xmath177 , @xmath172 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 and several bias voltages .",

    "we see that in addition of the known splitting of the kondo peak with @xmath5,@xcite also the replica of the kondo peak near @xmath204 splits , a fact which again supports the notion that this satellite peak is related with the kondo peak at the fermi energy . for @xmath205 ,",
    "a splitting also takes place , but only for bias voltage large enough so that @xmath206 overcomes the intrinsic width of this feature .",
    "the inset shows that the onset of this peak at @xmath207 , is also split by the bias voltage , and the splitting is clearly visible already for small bias voltages , of the order of a few times @xmath208 .    in fig .",
    "[ didv ] we display the conductance @xmath209 , where @xmath44 is the current as a function of a applied bias voltage @xmath5 for a temperature slightly above the kondo temperature and several values of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "in addition to the kondo peak at @xmath6 , and the charge - transfer peak near @xmath210 replicas of the kondo peak with smaller intensity appear for @xmath211 reflecting the inelastic processes in which a phonon is created or destroyed .",

    "since most of voltage drop falls between the system and the other lead , the situation is similar to that in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , in which the spectral density is little affected by the less coupled lead ( or stm tip ) and the spectral density is reflected in the differential conductance @xmath222.@xcite therefore , the resulting conductance is qualitatively similar to the spectral density as a function of frequency , shown before in fig .",

    "the spectral density shows and interplay of the usual kondo physics in which the magnetic moment is screened by conduction electrons at low energies , and the vibrations . as a consequence of the latter ,",
    "peaks appear in the spectral density at frequencies near multiple of @xmath223 , which reflect the physics of both kondo screening and the effect of vibrations .",
    "however , the nature of these replicas of the kondo effect , its exact position and width deserve further study . in particular it would be interesting to include a finite coulomb repuslsion @xmath12 and study the evolution of the replicas above and below the fermi level , as the model evolves from the symmetric anderson model to infinite @xmath12 .",
    "the characteristic energy scale @xmath10 decreases slightly ( not in an exponential form ) with increasing electron - phonon coupling @xmath23 for fixed effective level energy @xmath64 .",
    "we find that this effective level @xmath64 is slightly larger than @xmath224 and this difference has important consequences for example , when the kondo temperature for different @xmath23 is compared .",
    "the conductance through the system at small temperatures shows not only a central peak at small applied bias voltages @xmath5 due to the kondo peak , but also additional peaks that correspond to inelastic processes involving creation and destruction of phonons . in our calculation , for a symmetric voltage drop we only see marked peaks near @xmath225 , but additional peaks are expected for larger @xmath0 or smaller temperatures .",
    "we have limited our calculations to @xmath226 .",
    "we do not expect the nca to be valid for large @xmath0 . for small @xmath0",

    "note that this wave function in contrast to that proposed by varma and yafet ( vy),@xcite is not a singlet but a doublet . while the vy choice leads to an energy gain of the order of the kondo temperature , which depends exponentially on the hybridization @xmath39 , and the correct spin ( @xmath240 ) of the ground state , our doublet gains more energy , with a difference proportional to @xmath241 in the kondo limit . in this limit ,",
    "a comparison of the local occupation @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the total energy , with nrg results suggests that the energy gain is qualitatively correct ( about half the correct value ) and much better than that predicted by the slave - boson approximation in mean field level.@xcite    expanding @xmath244 in a basis of occupations of the phonons @xmath123 , using the equation @xmath245 , it is easy to see that @xmath246 .",
