    "how did galaxies form ? ultimately , this simple question captures most , if not all of the most widely pursued research topics in cosmology . surveys of galaxies at different redshifts are being used to study which galaxies contain most of the stellar mass at a given epoch , and which galaxies are undergoing the strongest evolution .",
    "these measurements serve to constrain models of structure formation .",
    "the main formative processes associated with typical galaxies ( e.g. star formation , merging , and feedback ) were largely completed within the first half of the hubble time , making their study a very challenging one .",
    "one of the best probes for studying star formation in the early universe is provided by galaxies that are luminous in the rest - frame uv due to intense star formation .",
    "the most luminous of these , the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , are easily detected at @xmath6 in deep pencil beam surveys from the ground and with the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "there is only a modest decrease in the uv luminosity density from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that lbgs represent a major phase in the early stages of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "based on their clustering and number statistics , lbgs are the precursors of present day massive galaxies undergoing a phase of intense star formation , and a large fraction of lbgs may merge to form elliptical galaxies that are situated in present - day groups and clusters @xcite .    studies of the structure and sizes of lbgs indicate that high redshift galaxies are compact ( @xmath10.10.3 , or @xmath112.5 kpc ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that large ( @xmath110.4 ) low surface brightness galaxies are rare .",
    "the morphologies are best characterized as being dominated by one to several uv - bright knots embedded in diffuse emission , with little difference between the rest - frame uv and optical light distributions @xcite .",
    "the morphologies of lbgs are unlike those of nearby galaxies on the hubble sequence .",
    "this is true even if the images of the nearby objects are degraded so that they have similar resolution and depth to those of lbgs .",
    "lbg morphologies are more similar to those of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which occupy a region of the concentration / asymmetry plane that lies between double - nucleated mergers , spheroids and disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , the interpretation of the uv morphologies of high redshift populations remains problematic ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because it is unclear whether the irregular morphologies are a consequence of the merging of gas - rich galaxies , or whether one is just seeing patchily distributed star formation within a single system .",
    "the answer to this question and how it evolves with redshift is essential for understanding how galaxies formed .    a detailed study of lbgs is limited by two factors .",
    "first , their distances render them small and faint , and , second , star forming galaxies at high redshift are systematically different from starburst galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "local starbursts ( sbs ) show strong correlations among their basic properties that are different from lbgs . in particular , there is a systematic increase in the amount of dust obscuration ( @xmath12 ) with increasing sfr , corresponding to a systematic increase in metallicity with mass .",
    "lbgs are substantially less obscured than local sbs of similar sfr or mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the relatively low extinction of lbgs is also a characteristic of blue compact dwarfs ( bcds , alsoor galaxies ) , but the latter have sfrs that are typically two orders of magnitude smaller than lbgs and they have lower masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "although bcds may resemble the faintest lbgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "lbgs have systematically lower metallicities and higher gas - mass fractions than local sbs with the same sfrs .",
    "the typical mechanisms that trigger starbursts might also be very different at high redshift compared to low redshift .",
    "clearly , if we could find relatively nearby starburst galaxies whose properties are the best match to lbgs , we could study for the first time at a much higher physical resolution how the vigorous star formation and morphologies of typical high redshift galaxies are related .",

    ", this resulted in a sample of 31 `` supercompact uv - luminous galaxies '' ( uvlgs ) .",
    "interestingly , once selected according to these criteria , the uvlg sample proved to be similar to typical lbgs in all other measurable properties ( see h05 and h07 ) .",
    "further details on the sample are given by @xcite , who investigated the radio to uv continuum properties of the sample and found that they follow the radio - far infrared correlation of normal star - forming galaxies , but generally have less dust than other star forming galaxies with such high specific sfrs . in this respect , they are similar to lbgs .",
    "this suggests that the process that causes star formation in the supercompact uvlgs differs from other local star forming galaxies , but may be similar to lbgs .",
    "our sample of uvlgs ( `` local lbg analogs '' ) is therefore highly valuable for understanding the nature of lyman break galaxies at high redshifts .    in this paper ( paper i )",

    "they reach this conclusion by fitting the sdss _",
    "r_-band images with a two component model ( point source plus disk ) and then using the half - light radius of _ only the disk _ component to recompute the size of the uvlgs . in doing this",
    ", the authors made a serious mistake , because they ignore the fact that on average , half the light in their model fits comes from the central _ `` point source '' _ ( see their table 1 ) .",
    "+ @xmath223 the claim in the @xcite paper that most of the fuv flux in compact uvlgs should come from a large disk component relies on the observation that there exists a population of galaxies with relatively red bulges not visible in the fuv and very blue outer rings or disks that are only apparent in the uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". it should be clear both from the results presented in h05 and h07 , and from the analysis of hst data presented here , that uvlgs are an entirely different class of objects .",
    "in fact , the uvlgs are clearly more extended in the optical than in the uv due to an underlying ( older ) component .",
    "the uvlgs have very blue inner colors , and become redder outwards ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] and table [ tab : sizes ] ) .",
    "this is opposite to the assumption of @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath223 the hst @xmath54  images confirm that the uvlgs are indeed very compact objects .",
    "in fact , in most cases , the half light radius is even smaller than the seeing deconvolved sdss _ u_-band size ( table [ tab : sizes ] ) . in the case of both j005527.46002148.7 and j080844.26 + 394852.3 the uv flux is dominated by an unresolved component even at the hst resolution .",
    "furthermore , when we extrapolate the slope of the uv continuum measured from the fuv  nuv color and",
    "predict the @xmath54  flux , we find good agreement with the measured @xmath54flux ( sect .",
    "[ sec : sizes ] ) , indicating that the @xmath54  ( and sdss _",
    "u_-band ) image is a good tracer of the fuv morphology . in the case of",
    "j214500.25 + 011157.3 we have an acs / sbc image taken through f150lp , a filter that is almost identical to the galex fuv filter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the corresponding fuv surface brightness calculated solely from the acs data , @xmath68 @xmath69 kpc@xmath70 , is slightly lower than the value of h07 based on galex and sdss ( @xmath224 @xmath69 kpc@xmath70 ) , but still well above our lbg selection threshold of @xmath225 @xmath69 kpc@xmath70 .",
    "+ @xmath223 as we have discussed above , the galaxy sizes defined by @xcite pertain only to the disk component and thus can not be compared with the half - light radii quoted by h05 and h07 .",
    "@xcite also did not apply their profile fitting methodology to the full sample in a uniform way .",
    "they only applied their analysis to the objects that were marked as `` supercompact '' by h07 and not to the other uvlgs . as a result , their concluding figure 5 is misleading .",
    "it appears to show that the lbg analogs have a similar fuv surface brightness as the main sample .",
    "had they applied their technique to all the objects in the sample , the compact uvlgs would still form an upper envelope to the @xmath21 distribution , with the overall @xmath21 distribution shifted downwards toward lower surface brightness due to the fact that the `` point source '' flux in their fits was ignored .",
    "+ @xmath223 finally , we would like to remind the reader that the real test of whether or not a given sample of nearby galaxies are good analogs of lbgs is not the uv selection per s ( note that the lbg luminosity function extends over many orders of magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , but whether their main physical properties are indeed similar .",
    "we firmly believe that our sample of lbg analogs have passed this test ."
