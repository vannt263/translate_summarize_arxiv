    "a precursor to much mathematical analysis of gauge theories is the chiral anomaly , discussed by bell and me [ 3 ] ( also adler and , earlier , others [ 4 ] ) before non - abelian theories entered center - stage .",
    "we showed that a chiral symmetry of classical dynamics does not in general survive quantization : in the presence of fermions , the continuity equation for the classically conserved , but quantum mechanically non - conserved chiral current , @xmath5 , becomes proportional to the  anomaly \" after quantization .",
    "@xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the dual of @xmath8 . ) physicists later recognized the quantity on the right as the chern - pontryagin topological density .",
    "the anomaly allowed evading a chiral symmetry - based , model - independent no - go theorem prohibiting the neutral pion from decaying into two photons  a process seen in nature .",
    "evidently quantum effects destroy the apparent ( classical ) chiral symmetry and negate the physically unacceptable prohibition .",
    "this was very much appreciated by bell s good friend veltman , who ( with sutherland ) established the no - go result [ 5 ] .",
    "his pupil  thooft later made important connections between the chiral anomaly and properties of the standard model ( see below ) .",
    "the first application of the chiral anomaly to the standard model came with the observation by gross and me [ 6 ] ( also bouchiat , iliopoulos and meyer [ 7 ] ) that the  thooft - veltman argument for renormalizability of gauge theories remains valid only if fermion content is arranged so that gauge fields couple to currents that are free of anomalies , in which case the yang - mills equation with sources @xmath9 is self - consistent .",
    "@xmath10 \\equiv \\mathcal{d}_\\mu f^{\\mu \\nu } = j^\\nu \\nonumber\\\\ 0 & = & \\mathcal{d}_\\nu \\mathcal{d}_\\mu",
    "f^{\\mu \\nu } = \\mathcal{d}_\\nu j^\\nu \\label{one2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this requirement together with the strength of the anomaly , fixed experimentally by the @xmath11 decay amplitude , provides up to now one of the few principles for determining the color and family structure of elementary fermions ( quarks , leptons ) in nature .    nevertheless , the subject lay fallow until instantons were found by belavin , polyakov , schwartz and tyupkin @xcite ( who called them  pseudoparticles \" ) .",
    "instantons are classical gauge field configurations in imaginary time ( euclidean space - time ) that are self - dual or anti self - dual .",
    "@xmath12 therefore , they satisfy the classical , imaginary - time , sourceless yang - mills equation , @xmath13 by virtue of the bianchi identity for the dual field strength .",
    "@xmath14 moreover , the 4-dimensional integral of the chern - pontryagin density evaluated on instanton configurations takes values fixed by an integer that labels the homotopy class to which the gauge field belongs .",
    "the non - vanishing value for this integral came as a surprise , because the chern - pontryagin density is itself a total divergence , so its integral is a surface term frequently ignored by physicists .",
    "@xmath15    @xmath16 is called the chern - simons or anomaly current , whose time component @xmath17 contains only spatial quantities .",
    "@xmath17 is also called the chern - simons density , about which i shall have more to say later .",
    "@xmath18    the surprising relevance of all this to quantum physics in minkowski space - time comes about for the following reasons .",
    "since the baryon number current in the standard model does not couple to a gauge field , it can remain anomalous , even though it is a vector quantity with no chiral component .",
    "this possibility was appreciated already in the original paper with bell [ 3 ] , but no physical consequence was drawn , because the total accumulated change of the anomalous charge , @xmath19 , is a surface term of no apparent importance before the advent of instantons .",
    "@xmath20    however , ",
    "thooft realized that this reasoning is inadequate [ 9 ] .",
    "he observed that instantons can be used to evaluate approximately the yang - mills functional integral continued to imaginary time .",
    "since also the instanton - dominated integral of the chern - pontryagin density is non - vanishing ,  thooft concluded that baryon number is not conserved in the standard model . by evaluating the euclidean functional integral in a gaussian approximation around the instanton solution of belavin _ et al .",
    "_ , he calculated the baryon lifetime . fortunately it is exponentially small , but diamonds in principle are not forever",
    ".    there remained much to be done in extending ",
    "thooft s results .",
    "one wished to identify the physical mechanism in minkowski space - time behind the approximate evaluation of an euclidean functional integral .",
    "also  thooft found that his answer depends on an angle @xmath21 , which is not seen in gauge field dynamics ; again a physical explanation was needed .    by recalling known procedures in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry rebbi and i [",
    "10 ] ( also callan , dashen and gross [ 11 ] ) explained that classical paths in imaginary time signal quantum tunneling , whose probability amplitude in the semi - classical approximations is given by the euclidean functional integral in gaussian approximation around the imaginary time path .",
    "but where does the tunneling take place ? to answer this , and also to understand the @xmath21-angle , we examined the gauge theory in the schrdinger representation , where quantum states are described by wave functionals @xmath22 defined on configuration space variables  here the spatial vector potentials @xmath23 .",
    "( although the reality of a space of gauge field variables is obscure , it is no more obscure than the 3 n - dimensional space on which n - body , @xmath24 , quantum mechanical wave functions are defined . )",
    "we then drew the following qualitative but exact picture of the quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the gauss law and conventional gauge fixing ( of the kind described by faddeev in this volume ) ensure that @xmath22 is unchanged when @xmath23 undergoes a gauge transformation that is deformable to the identity ; so called a `` small '' gauge transformation .",
    "however , in non - abelian groups there are gauge transformations that are homotopically non - trivial and can not be connected to the identity . for these `` large '' transformations , labeled by an integer @xmath25 that indexes the homotopy class to which the gauge transformation belongs",
    ", @xmath26 changes by a phase .",
    "this phase is the @xmath21-angle encountered by ",
    "thooft in his calculation .    in the classical ground state ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath27 vanishes .",
    "this is achieved not only with vanishing @xmath23 , but also with pure - gauge vector potentials .",
    "since large gauge functions fall into classes labeled by the integers , the potential energy profile takes on a periodic structure , reminiscent of a bloch crystal and depicted in the figure below .",
    "the zero - energy troughs correspond to pure gauge vector potentials constructed from gauge functions belonging to the @xmath28 homotopy class .",
    "thus the classical ground state is ( infinitely ) degenerate .",
    "quantum mechanical tunneling lifts this degeneracy and creates energy bands . usually in quantum field theory tunneling",
    "is suppressed by infinite energy barriers between degenerate vacua  this leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however , in yang - mills theory there are imaginary time paths in field space , which avoid infinite barriers and interpolate between the vacua .",
    "semi - classically these are the instantons .",
    ", as can be verified by examining their large ( imaginary ) time asymptotes .",
    "the final picture is portrayed schematically in the above figure .    to go beyond qualitative considerations we constructed an explicit functional of @xmath23 , which is invariant against small gauge transformations but not large ones .",
    "@xcite this is just the spatial integral of the chern - simons density , introduced in ( [ one7 ] ) .",
    "one readily checks that the chern - simons term @xmath29 satisfies the gauss law by virtue of    @xmath30    but when @xmath23 is gauge transformed by a large gauge function in the @xmath28 homotopy class , @xmath31 shifts by the `` winding '' number @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath32 the last term in ( [ one11 ] ) evaluates the winding number of @xmath33 ( for well - behaved @xmath33 ) .",
    "every yang - mills wave functional can be presented as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , is invariant against all gauge transformations , small and large , while the non - invariance of @xmath36 is contained in the universal phase involving @xmath31 . @xmath37",
    "but in quantum theory a universal phase of wave functions may be removed at the expense of adding the time derivative of the phase to the theory s lagrangian .",
    "when this procedure is carried out with the help of ( [ one6 ] ) and ( [ one7 ] ) for the problem at hand , the yang - mills quantum theory becomes equivalently described by completely gauge invariant states , @xmath35 , while the yang - mills lagrangian acquires the addition @xmath38 , which does not contribute to equations of motion because it is a total time derivative .",
    "this shows that the @xmath21-angle is associated with lorentz invariant but cp ( or t ) violating phenomena , which through our analysis are understood in exact terms , while instantons provide a semi - classical description .",
    "we are left with a puzzle : what fixes the magnitude of @xmath21 , whose experimental consequences ( _ e.g. _ neutron electric dipole moment ) have never been seen ?",
    "( an analogy with the cosmological constant puzzle is apparent . )",
    "the anomaly - based instanton investigation of the standard model did not produce any useful numbers for experimentalists to measure .",
    "but it affected deeply our understanding of the theory . also it suggested a wealth of interesting mathematical problems to which rebbi and i found solutions by methods drawn from analysis , geometry and topology .",
    "we proved that the belavin _",
    "instanton preserves an @xmath39 symmetry subgroup of the @xmath40 conformal invariance group for euclidean yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "this allows a group theoretical classification of motions in the presence of the instanton .",
    "furthermore , use of @xmath39 covariant coordinates yields simple and elegant formulas , so that evaluating the functional integral in a gaussian approximation around the instanton becomes transparent .",
    "we @xcite ( also schwartz , as well as atiyah , hitchin and singer @xcite ) showed that the most general instanton configuration with chern - pontryagin index @xmath41 can be viewed as a non - linear superposition of @xmath42 individual instantons , which depends on latexmath:[$8    positions in 4-dimensional space , @xmath42 instanton sizes , and @xmath44 group variables of @xmath45 . also following a suggestion by  thooft , we exhibited the most general , explicit multi - instanton formula .",
    "@xcite our expression is closed under conformal transformations and maximizes the parameter count for @xmath46 .",
    "( for @xmath47 , no explicit formula for the general solution is known , but a procedure for constructing it at given @xmath42 has been found by atiyah , drinfeld , hitchin and manin .",
    "@xcite )    much of this analysis involves zero eigenvalue solutions to 4-dimensional elliptic differential equations in the presence of instantons .",
    "the number of these zero modes is determined by the chern - pontryagin index of the background gauge field .",
    "this is the statement of the celebrated atiyah - singer index theorem which appeared in physics for the first time because of these considerations .",
    "@xcite indeed the anomaly equation ( 1.1 ) may be viewed as a local version of the theorem .",
    "the zero modes arise not only with 4-dimensional instantons , but also in the presence of extended , topologically interesting field configurations in other dimensions .",
    "for example ,  thooft and polyakov @xcite found that magnetic monopole configurations are present as classical static solutions to some gauge theories based on semi - simple groups , like @xmath45 .",
    "rebbi and i @xcite ( also hansenfratz and ",
    "thooft @xcite ) then showed that spinless boson fields , carrying half - integer isospin , bind to the monopole with zero energy and form a spin @xmath48 excitation in the quantum theory , even though all  constituents \" carry integer spin . while it is uncertain whether magnetic monopoles and the associated spin fractionization have a physical presence in nature ( they are not features of the standard model ) analogous effects can arise in condensed matter systems that are available in a laboratory .",
    "for example , 1-dimensional topological kinks form domain walls in lineal polymers like polyactelene .",
    "electrons propagating across these kinks experience fractionization of their quantum numbers  an effect that has been observed experimentally .",
    "@xcite    the zero modes associated with monopoles and kinks arise in elliptic differential equations in odd dimensions , where the atiyah - singer index can not be used because it is restricted to even dimensions .",
    "callias , a student at that time , provided the necessary extension , and the  callias index \" is now used for counting zero modes in odd - dimensional spaces .",
    "@xcite    the mathematical activity surrounding instantons and other extended objects , like monopoles , vortices and kinks , seeded an interaction between physics and mathematics , which is still flourishing . at an american physical society meeting , where i summarized the above results @xcite , singer declaimed a poetic pean to physics ",

    "exploration of yang - mills theory brought physicists attention to gauge theoretic invariants , other than the yang - mills lagrange density @xmath49 .",
    "i have already discussed the anomaly - determined chern - pontryagin density @xmath50 ( 1.1 ) .",
    "it does not contribute to equations of motion because it is a total derivative , but it controls the @xmath21-angle .",
    "further there is the chern - simons current @xmath16 ( 1.6 ) and density @xmath51 ( 1.7 )   anti - derivatives \" of the chern - pontryagin density .",
    "defined on 3-space , @xmath52 is not gauge invariant .",
    "but its properly normalized integral over 3-space  the chern - simons term @xmath31 ( 1.9 )  responds only to large gauge transformatives by the integer winding number of the gauge function .",
    "@xmath31 first entered physics as the phase of yang - mills quantum states , ( 1.13 ) , where it is responsible for the @xmath21-angle .",
    "another remarkable but futile role for @xmath31 is that @xmath53 solves the yang - mills functional schrdinger equation with zero eigenvalue by virtue of ( 1.10a ) : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the yang - mills hamiltonian .",
    "it is astonishing that such a non - linear , integro - differential , functional equation possesses a simple and explicit solution .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath56 can not describe a physical state because @xmath57 is not gauge invariant against large gauge transformations , and grows exponentially for large ( functional ) argument .",

    "the integer valued gauge non - invariance of @xmath62 does not prevent using that 3-dimensional quantity in the action for a gauge theory on a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time . because its variation ( 1.10a ) is gauge covariant",
    ", @xmath62 contributes a gauge covariant quantity to the equation of motion .",
    "also in a quantum theory only the phase exponential of the action need be gauge invariant .",
    "with this in mind , deser and i @xcite ( together with students and postdoctoral fellows ) proposed that @xmath63 be included in the action for a novel ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gauge theory , where @xmath64 is strength of the new term .",
    "[ here @xmath2 is a ( @xmath65)-dimensional space - time covariant vector potential , not a 3-dimensional spatial vector @xmath23 . ]    in order to preserve gauge invariance of the phase exponential of the action for a non - abelian theory , @xmath64 must be quantitized to be an integral multiple of @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath67 remains invariant even against large gauge transformations , which shift @xmath62 by an integer .",
    "this coupling constant quantization is the precise field theoretic analog of dirac s celebrated monopole strength quantization .",
    "of course in an abelian theory , there are no large gauge transformations ; @xmath62 is gauge invariant ; quantization of the interaction strength is not needed .",
    "the modified but gauge covariant equation of motion , with a covariantly conserved source , reads @xmath68 the non yang - mills term on the left comes from varying @xmath69 , see ( [ one10a ] ) .",

    "note that ( [ three2 ] ) is consistent with ( [ three3 ] ) .",
    "the dimension of @xmath64 is mass ( in units of the gauge coupling constant ) and one sees either from the linear portion of ( [ three1 ] ) or from the linear abelian case that gauge excitations in this theory are massive , while retaining gauge invariance !",
    "this provides yet another example where gauge invariance does not enforce masslessness for gauge field excitations .",
    "note that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are violated by the mass term .",
    "because the mass term in ( [ three1 ] ) has one fewer derivative than the usual yang - mills kinetic term , it dominates at low energies and large distances . in the absence of the yang - mills term , equation ( [ three1 ] ) reduces to a field - current identity .",
    "@xmath74 this is especially interesting in the abelian case ",
    "planar electrodynamics  where the components of ( [ three4 ] ) read    @xmath75    here @xmath76 is a planar electric field ; @xmath77 , a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane ; @xmath78 is a charge density and @xmath79 a planar current .",
    "a further consequence of ( [ three5a ] ) , which also follows from the time component of ( [ three1 ] ) or ( [ three2 ] ) , is the integrated statement @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the magnetic flux through the plane and @xmath82 is the charge .",
    "relations like ( [ three5a])-([three6 ] ) arise in descriptions of the quantum hall regime , and the chern - simons term has been widely used to model this planar effect .",

    "also physics returned the chern - simons term to mathematics when witten used it in a functional integral formula for knot invariants .",
    "my investigations of chern - simons based gauge theories mostly concern the truncated equations ( [ three4 ] ) with source currents constructed from specific field theoretic or point particle variables .",
    "the dynamics of the sources is also self consistently included .",
    "for sources made from relativistic scalar fields with precisely tuned self interactions , e. weinberg and i @xcite ( also hong , kim and pac @xcite ) found static vortex solutions , similar to ginsburg - landau ( nielsen - olesen ) vortices at the boundary between type i and type ii superconductors .",
    "although equations are only partially integrable , we showed that in the abelian case both topological and non - topological vortices are present .",
    "furthermore , pi and i @xcite considered non - relativistic scalar field dynamics , more specifically the non - relativistic limit of the above mentioned model . in that case",
    "the static equations are completely integrable , providing explicit profiles for the vortices .",
    "it is known that conventional vortex models , without the chern - simons term , support only charge - neutral vortices .",
    "on the other hand , the chern - simons vortices are charged , by virtue of ( [ three6 ] ) . also generically",
    ", they carry arbitrary , unquantized angular momentum .",
    "this is a consequence of planar dynamics where rotations are abelian and angular momentum need not be quantized .",
    "@xcite    it is important that the chern - simons term is not merely an _ ad hoc _ @xmath72 and @xmath73 violating addition to planar gauge theories , which could be included or omitted at will . even when it is absent in a bare lagrangian containing fermions , it arises from radiative corrections .",
    "massless fermions in ( @xmath65)-dimensional space - time preserve planar parity invariance .",

    ". one more instance of this phenomenon is known : anomalous quantum mechanical breaking of scale and conformal invariance .",
    "generically these do not survive in non - trivial quantum field theories , not even in quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite although not necessarily confined to gauge theories , nor possessing any significant topological aspects , the scale / conformal anomalies share with the previous two the property of destroying an enhancement of symmetry that masslessness would entail .",
    "this common feature prepared coleman and me to understand and explain why the relevant currents are not conserved , with anomalous divergences governed by the anomalously non - vanishing trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "@xcite it appears that nature abhors masslessness , but we do not know why .",
    "finally we note that the chern - simons term @xmath83 , viewed as a quantity defined on three spatial dimensions , can be inserted into the action for a lorentz invariant theory in ( @xmath84 ) dimensional space - time . due to the dimensional mismatch ,",
    "this acts as a source of lorentz and ctp violation .",
    "the idea has been developed for electrodynamics by carroll , field and me .",
    "@xcite there it produces a modification of the maxwell equations only in ampres law , which in the lorentz violating theory reads @xmath85 ( a source current containing a contribution from a magnetic field is familiar in magnetohydrodynamics . )",
    "the physical consequence of ( [ three7 ] ) is that the vacuum becomes birefringent , and propagating light waves undergo a faraday - like rotation .",
    "light from distant galaxies provides an experimental measure of this effect .",
    "available observational data indicates that it does not occur in nature ; @xmath86 .",
    "general relativity with its diffeomorphism invariance embodies the symmetry of local translations .",

    "the role of @xmath133 in 3-dimensional geometry is the following . in four or more dimensions",
    "there exists the weyl tensor , which functions in two ways .",
    "it is the non - ricci part of the riemann tensor ; also it serves as a template for conformal flatness : vanishing if and only if the space is conformally flat . in three dimensions",
    "the riemann tensor only has a ricci part ; the weyl tensor is absent .",
    "[ that is why in 3-dimensional einstein theory there is no curvature external to matter sources , and there are no propagating excitations . ]    in the absence of the 3-dimensional weyl tensor , @xmath133 replaces it as the conformal template , vanishing if and only if space - time is conformally flat . while these geometric properties of @xmath133 are ancient knowledge , the fact that it arises from varying the gravitational chern - simons term was a new discovery , made possible by the gauge theory - gravity connection .",
    "@xcite    the gauge theory chern - simons term can be added to a 3-dimensional yang - mills theory , giving rise to massive but gauge invariant excitations .",
    "so also the gravitational chern - simons term can supplement 3-dimensional einstein theory , where it has even more profound consequences .",
    "it converts a theory with no propagating excitations into one with a massive propagating mode , all the time maintaining diffeomorphism invariance !",
    "the equation of motion with an energy - momentum tensor source reads @xmath138 since @xmath133 is of one higher derivative order than @xmath139 , the strength parameter @xmath64 has dimension of mass , and @xmath64 is also the mass of the propagating degree of freedom in the linearized theory .",
    "thus in the einstein limit , cooresponding to @xmath140 , the massive excitation decouples leaving non - propagating degrees of freedom .",
    "the quantum theory is well behaved , in spite of the higher derivatives in @xmath133 . unlike in the gauge theory ,",
    "coupling constant quantization is not needed , because the gravitational chern - simons term is invariant against ( well behaved ) coordinate transformations .",
    "the gravitational chern - simons term @xmath128 may also be presented in terms of the spin connection @xmath141 . from ( [ one11 ] ) ,",
    "( [ foura7b])/([foura10 ] ) and ( [ fourb1 ] ) follows @xmath142 although the second term , being the winding number of @xmath114 , does not contribute to the equations of motion , it should not be dropped ; otherwise confusion arises : @xmath143 in minkowski space is a chern - simons term based on the local lorentz group so(2.1 ) , which does not support gauge transformations with non - zero winding ; @xmath143 is so(2.1 ) invariant .",
    "however , it is usually belived that field theory may be analytically continued to euclidean space . in that case",
    "@xmath143 is the chern - simons term for so(3 ) and this does possess non - trivial windings .",
    "so it is difficult to understand how @xmath143 could function in a quantum theory : with lorentzian signature its coefficent can be arbitrary , with euclidean signature it must be quantized !",
    "which should it be ?",
    "fortunately we need not answer this question , because @xmath143 does not stand alone : it is supplemented by the last term in ( [ fourb7 ] ) whose response to euclidean rotations must cancel any non - invariance of @xmath143 , because together they equal @xmath128 , which does not feel local rotations .    similarly to the work by carroll _",
    "_ on chern - simons extended electromagnetism , pi and i added the gravitational chern - simons term to 4-dimensional einstein relativity . @xcite linearized analysis indicates that , contrary to the electromagnetic case , wave propagation is not affected .",
    "another noteworthy feature is that vacuum space - times , which satisfy the modified equations , necessarily possess vanishing gravitational chern - pontryagin density , @xmath144 .",
    "correspondingly , the schwarzschild space - time remains a solution , but kerr space - time becomes modified .",
    "\\(i ) * response to changes in coordinates *    in general , fields respond to an infinitesimal coordinate transformation , generated by the vector @xmath145 , through the lie derivative @xmath146 with respect to @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath147 @xmath146 involves ordinary derivatives ; for example for a covariant vector the action of @xmath146 is        moreover , when the space possesses a metric structure lie derivatives of covariant objects ( scalars , vectors , tensors etc . )",
    "remain covariant ; _",
    "i.e _ replacing ordinary derivatives by coordinate covariant derivatives produces no change in the formulas .",
    "this is not true in gauge theories .",
    "for example the lie derivative of the field strength @xmath150 is not gauge covariant because the derivative acting on @xmath151 is not gauge covariant .",
    "similarly , the lie derivative of a vector potential , which follows formulas ( 4.c.3 ) ( @xmath152 ) is not gauge covariant . consequently coordinate transformations in a gauge theory , implemented by lie derivatives , loose gauge covariance .",
    "we now ask : is it possible to modify the implementation of coordinate transformations in gauge theories so that gauge covariance is preserved ?",
    "the positive answer that i gave @xcite draws on notational analogies between gauge and gravity fields .",
    "let us record the gravity formulas . under ( 4.c.1 ) and",
    "( 4.c.2 ) the metric tensor transforms as @xmath153 the last equality follows from the previous when ordinary derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives , which also annihilate @xmath129.with ( [ fourc5 ] ) we find the response of the christoffel connection from ( [ fourb3 ] ) , @xmath154 and furthermore @xmath155 [ fourc7 ] both ( [ fourc6 ] ) and ( [ fourc7 ] ) exhibit a coordinate covariant response .",
    "when we consider the gauge theoretic analog to ( [ fourc6 ] ) , we expect to find that the coordinate transformation of the covariant vector potential , _",
    "i.e._its lie derivative , can be presented analogously to ( [ fourc6 ] ) as the sum of two terms : a projection on the field strength and a total derivative .",
    "this is indeed the case , as is readily established by adding and subtracting suitable terms in ( [ fourc3a ] ) @xmath156 .",

    "it is the last term in ( [ fourc8 ] ) that spoils gauge covariance .",
    "we recognize it as an infinitesimal gauge transformation with gauge function of @xmath158 .",
    "but in a gauge theory , gauge transformations can be performed at will .",
    "we use this freedom to redefine the response of gauge variables by supplementing the lie derivatives with the gauge transformation that removes the last term in ( [ fourc8 ] ) . thus the modified , but gauge equivalent response reads @xmath159 and ( [ fourc9 ] ) has the consequence that @xmath160 this is gauge covariant and differs from the usual formula ( [ fourc4 ] ) by a gauge transformation of @xmath161 generated by @xmath162 . we may view ( [ fourc10 ] ) as defining",
    "a gauge covariant lie derivative .",
    "we thus achieve the goal of describing coordinate transformation of gauge fields in a gauge covariant manner , with a gauge covariant lie derivative .",
    "but there is a price to pay : the gauge covariant lie derivatives follow a closure rule that differs from conventional lie derivatives .",
    "the commutator of two gauge covariant lie derivatives , with respect to two vectors , @xmath145 and @xmath33 , closes on the gauge covariant lie derivative with respect to the lie bracket of @xmath145 and @xmath33 plus a gauge transformation generated by @xmath163 .      to determine whether a generic field is invariant against a coordinate transformation generated by @xmath145",
    ", we check whether its lie derivative annihilates @xmath164 .",
    "@xmath165 for the metric tensor this is the statement of the killing equation , see ( [ fourc5 ] ) .",
    "@xmath166 from ( [ fourc6 ] ) and ( 4.c.7 ) immediately follow well known conditions on killing vectors .",
    "@xcite @xmath167    but in a gauge theory a condition weaker than ( [ fourc11 ] ) is appropriate : a coordinate invariant configuration in a gauge theory need not be annihilated by the lie derivative , rather a gauge transformation may survive . in other words ,",
    "a gauge field configuration should still be considered as invariant , if any non invariance can be compensated by a gauge transformation . applying this condition to the gauge covariant transformation law ( [ fourc9 ] )",
    ", there emerges a gauge covariant criterion for an invariant gauge field configurations .",
    "@xmath168 here @xmath169 is an unspecified quantity , linear in @xmath145 .",
    "this is the gauge theoretic analog to ( [ fourc13 ] ) , except that in the gravity formula the quantity corresponding to @xmath169 is specified explicitly as @xmath170 .",
    "manton and i showed that @xmath169 generates the gauge transformation needed to compensate any coordinate asymmetry in an invariant gauge field configuration.therefore @xmath169 also contributes to the conserved constant of motion , which characterizes motion in the presence of such an invariant gauge field .",
    "@xcite    this is the origin of the celebrated addition to the angular momentum in the field of a dirac magnetic monopole : the conserved angular momentum comprises the kinematical angular momentum supplemented by the radial unit vector , which is also present in ( [ fourc15 ] ) , when @xmath171 is the magnetic monopole field and @xmath145 generates spatial rotations around the axis @xmath172 , then @xmath173 similarly , the  thooft - polyakov magnetic monopole is spherically symmetric up to an isospin gauge transformation .",
    "the angular momentum constant of motion therefore acquires an isospin component @xmath174 in addition to the kinematical angular momentum @xmath175 .",
