    "the discovery of new galaxy populations at high redshifts ( @xmath14 ) is one of the most exciting goals of deep galaxy surveys .",
    "currently , rapid progress is being made in this field , thanks to several deep multi - wavelength surveys that are being conducted with world - class ground - based and space telescopes .",
    "these new galaxy surveys can potentially make a breakthrough in the field by : i ) discovering galaxies beyond the maximum known galaxy redshift limit ; ii ) revealing a previously unrecognised galaxy population whose properties are significantly different to those of other known galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "the latter is crucial to achieve an unbiased view of how galaxy evolution proceeded over the first few billion years of cosmic time .",
    "the selection of galaxies with very red near - ir / optical colours has proven very useful to identify the high-@xmath15 tail of different galaxy populations .",
    "this is the underlying selection technique of what are traditionally called extremely red galaxies , i.e. galaxies with @xmath16 or @xmath17 vega mag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose redshift distribution is confined to @xmath18 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] @xcite .",
    "another kind of near - ir colour cut ( @xmath19 vega mag ) has been applied to select ` distant red galaxies ' at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the basis of these colour techniques lies in bracketing the galaxy 4000  @xmath21 break , which is shifted into the observed near - ir bands at @xmath22 $ \\sim$}}~}1.5 $ ] , although it is known that similar colours can also be displayed by galaxies with highly reddened spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "is shifted to wavelengths @xmath23 , implying that the potentially oldest and/or dustier galaxies at those redshifts could be missed even by deep near - ir surveys .",
    "this is indeed the case for the sub - millimetre source gn10 @xcite , which has no near - ir counterpart down to a magnitude of @xmath24 ( ab ) , but is detected at mid - ir wavelengths @xmath25 .",
    "very recently , huang et al .",

    "in this work we have undertaken a combined analysis of the _ spitzer _ extended deep survey ( seds ; ashby et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) with the _ hst _ cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; * ? ? ?",

    "our aim is to study the variety in composition of this colour - selected galaxy population , and investigate the existence of high-@xmath15 galaxy candidates .",
    "all magnitudes and colours quoted in this paper are total and refer to the ab system @xcite , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "all stellar masses refer to a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) over stellar masses @xmath31 .",
    "the warm _ spitzer_/irac seds survey has mapped five different fields of the sky at 3.6 and @xmath1 , over a total area of 0.90 deg@xmath4 , with an integration time of 12 hours / pointing . in this work we analyse the @xmath3180 arcmin@xmath4 of the seds uds field that overlap the _ hst _ candels survey @xcite , which comprises observations with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) f125w ( @xmath32 ) and f160w ( @xmath2 ) filters , and the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) f606w and f814w filters .",
    "the uds field also benefits from multi - wavelength ancillary data , including uv and optical data from subaru and the canada - france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , near - ir data from the uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) , and shallower _ spitzer _ data from the spuds legacy survey ( p.i .",

    "we have also visually inspected our irac seds sources that do not have a counterpart in the candels maps .",
    "there are 18 @xmath1 sources ( also detected at @xmath40 ) which are truly near - ir ` dropouts ' at the depth of the candels images .",

    "we have compiled up to 17-band photometry ( @xmath5 through @xmath41 ) for our 25 candels - detected @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxies , in order to model their seds , and constrain their redshifts and derived parameters .",
    "the shallow spuds 5.8 and @xmath41 data were included when available , which in some cases helped mitigate degeneracies in parameter space . for the sed modelling we have used a customised @xmath42-minimisation sed - fitting code with a library that included synthetic stellar templates from the 2007 version of the bruzual & charlot models @xcite , with solar metallicity , and two empirical templates of a type-2 qso and a qso / star - forming composite galaxy from the library by polletta et al .  ( 2006 ) . to account for internal extinction",

    "an assessment of the photometric redshift quality for galaxies in our parent @xmath1 sample has been presented in caputi et al .  (",
    "2011 ) : the overall dispersion is 5% , and @xmath45 for the @xmath46 sources . an important difference with respect to this paper is that we now include the deep candels data , which makes possible the identification and analysis of the @xmath47~>~4 $ ] sources .",
    "we show examples of our sed fitting results in fig .",

    "not surprisingly , in most cases the best - fitting solutions are degenerate in @xmath7 space , i.e. there are different @xmath7 combinations within 3@xmath35 confidence of the minimum @xmath42 value . in spite of this , the best - fitting solutions can be well identified in 17 out of our 25 @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxies . for the remaining eight , the resulting seds are ` unconstrained ' , i.e. the fitting degeneracies are so strong that the @xmath48 probability density is virtually flat , so we can not derive any clear redshift estimates . we provide the coordinates and photometry of all our sources in table  1 .",
    "the 17 sources with constrained seds can be classified in the following groups .",
    "this is the largest group within our sample : eleven out of 25 sources appear to be at @xmath8 , with extinction values in the range @xmath49 ( see examples in fig .",

    "we found that six out of the eleven @xmath8 galaxies are detected in the spuds @xmath9 images .",
    "for all these galaxies the best - fitting sed models are obtained with stellar templates rather than the empirical qso2 or composite templates ( and the latter solutions are excluded with 3@xmath35 confidence ) .",
    "however , two of them have @xmath9 flux densities @xmath50 , which strongly suggests that these galaxies could host obscured agn @xcite .",
    "the irac colours place one of them within the agn region empirically determined by stern et al .",

    "three out of four of the sources analysed by huang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) display redder @xmath0 $ ] colours than the sources analysed here .",

    "although we have included our @xmath1 sources that are @xmath2-band dropouts in fig .",
    "[ fig_colcol ] , unfortunately the @xmath78-[4.5]$ ] colours alone are not able to constrain the nature of these sources .",
    "we note , however , that their @xmath78-[4.5]$ ] colour distribution is quite similar to that of our candels - detected sources , so we expect a similar variety in their nature .",
    "the candels - detected @xmath0>4 $ ] galaxy population analysed here appears to be composed of different kinds of sources , and their extremely red near - to - mid - ir colours can be produced by different combinations of redshifts and internal extinction values .",
    "at least 45% of our",

    "however , alternative low-@xmath15 solutions can not be discarded within @xmath81 confidence , so we can not confirm the high-@xmath15 nature of these sources . in spite of this",
    ", we note that our two sources are more likely true @xmath13 galaxies than the irac high-@xmath15 candidates analysed by other authors @xcite , as our objects are considerably fainter in the irac bands and are not detected in the spuds @xmath9 images .    for the @xmath13 candidate that is best - fitted with a stellar template , we estimate a stellar mass of @xmath82 ( @xmath83 with a chabrier  ( 2003 ) imf ) .",
    "this value is significantly higher than the stellar masses derived for more typical galaxies at such high redshifts .",
    "the presence of massive galaxies at @xmath73 in a small cosmological volume is difficult to reconcile with the predicted comoving number density of dark - matter haloes that would be able to host such galaxies . according to the sheth & tormen  ( 1999 ) formalism",
    ", the number density of @xmath84 haloes at @xmath73 is only @xmath85 , three orders of magnitude smaller than the density of our two @xmath13 candidates over the seds / candels field . however , the predicted number density of haloes with @xmath86 is @xmath87 , which means that different uncertainties in e.g. the derived stellar masses , the imf , and/or the assumed baryon conversion fraction could make that these discrepancies are actually less dramatic .",
    "we note that such large stellar masses have been suggested for confirmed @xmath73 quasars .",
    "particularly , valiante et al .  (",
    "2011 ) argued that the observed dust mass and metallicity of sdss j1148 + 5251 ( @xmath88 ) can only be reproduced with a standard imf if the stellar mass is of @xmath89 .",
    "instead , reconciling the chemical properties of this quasar with smaller stellar masses requires a top - heavy imf .",
    "although sdss quasars are much rarer than our two sources , this argument suggests that one can not reject high-@xmath15 candidates only on the ground of large derived stellar masses .",
    "recently , based on the analysis of the 1.5 mag shallower spuds irac data , caputi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) studied the presence of massive galaxies at high redshifts and found only a few candidates at @xmath90 .",
    "our finding of two possible galaxy candidates at @xmath91 in the seds irac maps would suggest that deeper mid - ir data is essential to properly constrain the presence of massive galaxies at @xmath92 .",
    "the two @xmath13 candidates found here are detected in the spuds images , but were among the @xmath38% of faint ( @xmath93>22.4 $ ] mag ) spuds irac sources not analysed by caputi et al .",
    "( 2011 ) due to the lack of any near - ir identification at that time .",
    "our @xmath91 candidates are so faint at near - ir magnitudes that their spectroscopic confirmation is beyond the capabilities of any existing near - ir spectrograph . instead",
    ", the internal extinctions of these galaxies suggest that they could be far - ir sources , and thus the atacama large millimetre array ( alma ) could currently offer the only possibility to confirm their high @xmath15 .",
    "overall , we conclude that our red galaxy sample shows the tip of the iceberg of a previously unrecognised @xmath14 galaxy population , which will only be fully revealed with the advent of the mid - infrared instrument ( miri ) on the future _ james webb space telescope _ @xcite .",
