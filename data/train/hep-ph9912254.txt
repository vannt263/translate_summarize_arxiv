    "it is now possible to see why it is that this is the case .",
    "the results of table [ table3 ] show that , as expected , @xmath73 is only slightly modified ( at the @xmath165 level ) by ib effects .",
    "the ratio @xmath166 is , however , much closer to @xmath120 than the @xmath167 deviation produced by including only the leading order strong ib octet contributions .",
    "this decrease in the ib effect on @xmath74 has two sources .",
    "first , as can be seen from table [ table4 ] , there is a significant cancellation between the octet and em ib contributions to @xmath86 , which quantity dominates the determination of @xmath74 .",
    "second , this cancellation is facilitated by the fact that the @xmath80 and @xmath114 octet leakage contributions add destructively .",
    "this latter feature might seem unnatural given the observation that @xmath17 mixing is expected to _ increase _ the leading order octet ib effect , but there is , in fact , a natural reason why this is not the case . in the strong interaction part of the low energy effective theory , the effects of the @xmath17 are encoded entirely in the lec @xmath168 .",
    "a contribution proportional to @xmath168 , associated with the effects of mixing on the external @xmath14 legs , is , of course , present in the results above , and indeed , on its own , would serve to significantly increase the leading order result .",
    "however , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( 15)-(17 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , the lec contributions to the relevant mixing angles occur in the combination @xmath169 , for which , empirically , there is an almost complete cancellation between the @xmath168 and @xmath170 terms .",
    "this observation has also been made in the context of an estimate of nlo mixing contributions to the ib correction , @xmath171 , in @xmath172@xcite .",
    "a useful discussion of the resonance interpretation of the @xmath170 contribution can be found in that reference .",
    "the cumulative effect of _ all _ nlo corrections , including the strong lec corrections just discussed , is , in fact , to lower the magnitude of the leading order results ; the estimate based only on the inclusion of @xmath17 mixing effects thus turns out to be misleading .",
    "one of the great advantages of the chpt approach is that it allows one , in a straightforward manner , to include all contributions of a given chiral order which occur in the standard model .",
    "we conclude with a brief comment about the relation of the nominal phase , @xmath56 , and the actual relative phase , @xmath53 , between the @xmath16 and @xmath27 components of the two @xmath49 amplitudes . in order to fully explicate the phase question",
    ", one would require both a determination of the ib contributions to the ( in the presence of em , coupled channel ) @xmath28 scattering phases , and a determination , and subtraction , of non-@xmath28-scattering ib effects in the processes in which the @xmath28 phases are nominally measured .",
    "such expressions are not currently available , and a determination of them is beyond the scope of this paper . without such expressions , however , the relation between @xmath53 and the nominally determined experimental @xmath16 and @xmath27 @xmath28 phases is subject to ib corrections whose size is not , at present , known .",
    "in addition , one should bear in mind that the experimental data has yet to have applied to it the detector - dependent ir correction factor present in the expression for the @xmath173 cross - section ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "since the difference @xmath174 , from which the interference term which determines @xmath56 is obtained , is @xmath4 of the individual terms , even a @xmath175 ir correction can have a sizeable numerical impact .",
    "while the problems just discussed mean that uncertainties exist , both in our knowledge of the relation of @xmath53 to the measured @xmath28 scattering phase difference , and in the experimental determination of @xmath56 , our results , combined with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , allow us to quantify the deviation of @xmath56 from @xmath53 resulting from the presence of @xmath41 strong and em ib effects .",
    "we find , for the coefficient of @xmath176 in eq .",
    "( [ phaserelation ] ) , @xmath177 the second term in eq .",
    "( [ phaserelation ] ) is then @xmath178 ; its effect is thus tiny , and in any case , swamped by the error on @xmath179 . as an example of the magnitude of the resulting effect , note that , were @xmath53 to be @xmath180 , one would then obtain @xmath181 . recall that this effect is almost entirely em in origin .",
    "the sign of the em contributions is thus such as to significantly exacerbate the existing phase discrepancy .",
