    "one of the outstanding problems in astrophysics is the mechanism of core - collapse supernova explosions .",

    "it has tricked specialists with a legendary list of false starts and blind alleys .",
    "it has taunted computational astrophysicists with both its imagined and real complexities .",
    "the potential roles as factors in explosion of neutrinos , the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) , exotic physics , general relativity , dimensionality , instabilities , magnetic fields , and rotation all continue to be topical .    the neutrino - heating mechanism , in which a stalled bounce shock is reenergized by neutrino energy deposition after a slight delay , perhaps aided by overturning instabilities in this  gain region , \" has been the working hypothesis of the community for the last twenty years ( bethe & wilson 1985 ; buras et al . 2006ab ; liebendrfer et al . 2001 ) .",

    "however , the explosion energy is only @xmath310@xmath4 ergs and the major driver of the explosion is the neutrino - driven wind ( burrows 1987 ; burrows & goshy 1993 ; janka et al .",

    "curiously , they also infer a very weak explosion energy , this time near 10@xmath6 ergs , not correcting for neutrino driving subsequent to the early termination of their calculation or for the binding energy of the outer envelope .",
    "buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) focus on the importance of calculating over the full 180@xmath0 2d domain so as not to suppress the @xmath5 mode of the sasi , since they do not obtain even a weak explosion when constraining the computational domain to 90@xmath0 .",
    "they also imply that performing the calculations in 3d might make the explosion robust .    however , perhaps the most interesting conclusion of the buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) paper is that of all the progenitors they study ( including 11.2- , 13- , 15- , 20- , and 25-m@xmath2 models ) , only the 11.2-m@xmath2 star , with its steep outer density gradient , small iron core ( @xmath11.26 m@xmath2 ) , and close - in si / o density shelf , approaches the @xmath7 condition , promoted by thompson , quataert , & burrows ( 2005 ) as the litmus test for the neutrino - driven explosion mechanism is the timescale for shocked matter to traverse the gain region and @xmath8 is the neutrino heating timescale .",

    "( 2006 ) , buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , and janka et al .",
    "( 2005ab ) one might conclude that the neutrino mechanism requires compact cores and tenuous outer envelopes , but that for such progenitors a solely neutrino - driven explosion is perforce weak .",
    "the small accretion rates that may be necessary after bounce for the neutrino mechanism to succeed ensure that when it does succeed there is little mass to absorb the driving neutrino luminosity , resulting in the weak explosion .",
    "the neutrino - driven mechanism alone , and on its own , may not be able to yield a robust , @xmath110@xmath10-erg explosion .",
    "the large mass accretion rates experienced by more massive cores after bounce create more massive post - shock absorbing / gain regions and higher neutrino luminosities , but those same accretion rates may well tamp and suppress the neutrino - driven explosion .",
    "however , for the more massive progenitors that do nt now seem to explode by the neutrino mechanism , it may be that better neutrino transfer , coupled with and aided by an @xmath5 sasi mode calculated over the full 180@xmath0 domain , will follow the path of the 11.2-m@xmath2 progenitor as simulated by buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) and result in explosions .",
    "three - dimensional simulations with sophisticated neutrino numerics and physics have not been performed and may well reveal qualitative , or large quantitative , differences with the results in two dimensions .",
    "the neutrino mechanism may yet prove to be more muscular and universal .",
    "however , it is also possible that the typical supernova of the typical massive - star progenitor does not explode by the neutrino mechanism , or solely by the neutrino mechanism , and that another , non - magnetic , mechanism may be at work .",
    "recently , burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have proposed an acoustic mechanism for exploding core - collapse supernovae . in it ,",
    "the progressive growth of the sasi and of the entropy and mach number of the accreted shocked matter long after the outer shock has stalled results in anisotropic accretion onto the inner core that over time excites core g - modes .",
    "predominantly @xmath5 in character , these core eigenmodes achieve large amplitudes and dampen by the radiation of sound .",
    "multiple sound pulses emanate from the core with periods of 2 - 4 milliseconds and steepen into shock waves . the resulting acoustic power deposits energy and momentum aspherically into the outer shocked mantle and explodes the supernova , but on timescales of many hundreds of milliseconds to seconds .",
    "the blast is fundamentally aspherical , favoring one side . during the early explosion",
    ", the other side continues to experience accretion , which maintains the core oscillation and the generation of sound until the entire mantle has exploded .",
    "thus , the breaking of spherical symmetry and the excitation and maintenance of aspherical g - modes allow simultaneous accretion and explosion . as long as it is needed to ensure success , the core acts like a transducer for the conversion of accretion gravitational power into outwardly - propagating acoustic power .",
    "curiously , the recoil due to the resulting anisotropic mass loss pushes the accretion streams that are exciting the core oscillation into a configuration that is even more favorable for the excitation of @xmath5 core oscillations (  [ discussion ] ; burrows et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this way",
    ", the core g - modes seem self - excited .",
    "this is what we observe in our simulations , but such an intriguing phenomenon remains to be verified .",
    "perhaps , even if the initial explosion is neutrino - driven and it too is very asymmetrical due to the @xmath5 sasi mode , the recoil due to the anisotropic neutrino - driven mass loss can , by the same mechanism , excite core g - mode oscillations .",
    "hence , even a neutrino - triggered explosion might excite core oscillations , which would radiate acoustic power and boost the explosion energy .",
    "such a  hybrid \" mechanism for supernova explosions is a particularly intriguing possibility , but has yet to be adequately explored .",
    "one may further speculate that there is not one core - collapse supernova mechanism , but several .",
    "the lowest - mass massive star progenitors ( kitaura et al .",
    "2006 ; buras et al 2006b ) and accretion - induced collapse ( dessart et al .",
    "2006a ) might explode early and subenergetically by the neutrino - driven wind mechanism , while the generic progenitor might explode by the acoustic mechanism ( aided by neutrino heating ) .",
    "however , when better neutrino transport than we have employed is included , we may find that the neutrino / acoustic hybrid mechanism obtains throughout most of the progenitor mass range , particularly if the explosion commences after the vigorous phase of the @xmath5 sasi begins , with the relative contributions of neutrino heating and acoustic power varying as a function of progenitor mass .",
    "finally , the subset with rapidly rotating cores , or cores that collapse into black holes before explosion , might rely on mhd processes to explode the mantle , and these might be associated with hypernova and/or grbs .",
    "all in all , the outcome will depend upon the progenitor s inner density and rotation profiles .",
    "our calculations support the notion that all non - rotating progenitors that do not explode by the early neutrino mechanism experience the sasi , and later excite core pulsations that generate acoustic power that aids or enables explosion . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of preliminary investigations into the progenitor dependence of the core oscillation / acoustic mechanism . in ",
    "[ prog ] , we compare the density profiles of representative non - rotating progenitor models of woosley & weaver ( 1995 , ww95 ) , woosley , heger , & weaver ( 2002 ) , and nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) and discuss the resulting mass accretion and protoneutron star mass accumulation histories .",
    "these profiles determine the outcome of collapse . in ",
    "[ evolution ] , we discuss the overall hydrodynamic behavior of some of these models , focusing on the evolution of the shock position , the dependence of the sasi frequency upon progenitor profile , and the core pulsation energy . in ",
    "[ entropy ] , we discuss the entropies achieved , the degree of radiation domination , and the possible consequences for the r - process .",
    "we then go on in  [ aniso - wind ] to examine the aspherical wind - like character of the explosion and its consequences and the anisotropy of the neutrino emissions and the resulting recoils .",
    "this leads us to suggest a natural model for pulsar kicks .",
    "finally , in  [ discussion ] we summarize and discuss our conclusions concerning the core - oscillation / acoustic mechanism of core - collapse supernova explosions .    for these simulations",
    ", we have used the two - dimensional multi - group , multi - neutrino - species , flux - limited diffusion ( mgfld ) variant of the code vulcan/2d ( livne et al .",
    "2004 ; walder et al . 2005 ; ott et al . 2006ab ; dessart et al . 2006ab ; burrows",
    "et al . 2006 ) and describe many of its numerical features in the appendix .",
    "this is currently the only extant 2d , multi - group code that allows core translational motion by introducing a cartesian - like grid in the inner core and , hence , that is capable of investigating the core - oscillation / acoustic mechanism .",
    "vulcan/2d is also the only extant supernova code to perform 2d ( not  ray - by - ray \" ) multi - group transport .",
    "due to the finite - difference character of 2d codes that employ spherical coordinates all the way to the center , to the singularity in those coordinates at that center , and to the reflecting boundary condition frequently imposed at this center , spherical - coordinate codes are likely to inhibit core translational motions artificially and , hence , to inhibit the @xmath5 g - modes that are central to the mechanism we have identified .",
    "be that as it may , there are many caveats to our study the reader should keep in mind : 1 ) our calculations are newtonian and not general - relativistic , 2 ) as stated above , we employ an approximate multi - group transport algorithm in the neutrino sector , 3 ) numerical errors are bound to have accumulated due to the need to calculate for @xmath11,000,000 timesteps for each progenitor , and 4 ) the initial seed perturbations are unknown ( and unknowable ? ) .",
    "furthermore , the flow is fundamentally chaotic and a precise mapping between initial configuration and final outcome is not possible .",
    "this multi - dimensional radiation / hydrodynamical problem is quintessentially meteorological in character . nevertheless , along with the work of burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , these are the first calculations to explore the novel core oscillation / acoustic mechanism and to venture into the late - time behavior of multi - d core collapse with multi - d core motions and multi - d / multi - group transport .",
    "the basic evolutionary phases through which a core proceeds in the context of the core - oscillation / acoustic supernova mechanism have been described in burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , to which the reader is referred for details .",
    "these are summarized in  [ intro ] and in  [ discussion ] .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) explored the results for the 11-m@xmath2 model of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) alone . since that paper",
    ", we have calculated more models , including the 25-m@xmath2 model of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and the rotating m15b6 model of heger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ( ott et al .",
    "2006ab ) , as well as the 11.2-m@xmath2 , 13-m@xmath2 , 15-m@xmath2 , 20-m@xmath2 , and 25-m@xmath2 progenitor models of whw02 and the 13-m@xmath2 and 15-m@xmath2 models of nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) .",
    "all models explode , modulo any fallback at very , very late times not yet accessible to supernova codes .",
    "this set of models constitutes the most extensive and detailed radiation / hydrodynamic study of the shock instability ( sasi ) and of the multi - dimensional core motions undertaken to date .    for non - rotating models ,",
    "the most important determinant of the outcome of collapse is the density profile in the inner thousands of kilometers of the massive star progenitor .",
    "the structure of this  chandrasekhar \" core , with surrounding inner envelope , is determined by the burning history to the point of instability .",
    "this history reflects the various core and shell burning stages , and is a function in nature of zams mass , mass loss , and metallicity .",
    "however , different theoretical groups performing calculations of the evolution of massive stars and using different approaches to semi - convection , overshoot , convection , and mass loss still do not end with the same configurations .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] provides some density profiles for progenitor models from woosley , heger , & weaver ( 2002 ) , nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) , and woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) at a point just after collapse ensues .",
    "the first thing to note is that there is a spread in structures and that the  chandrasekhar \" core is not the same for all progenitors , but varies in structure and mass .",
    "the corresponding y@xmath11 and entropy profiles vary similarly . secondly , as a comparison of the two sets of 13-m@xmath2 and 15-m@xmath2 models shown on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] makes clear , the structure for a given progenitor mass has not converged theoretically .",
    "different groups arrive at different profiles for the same zams mass .",
    "the density profiles are not necessarily monotonic with zams progenitor mass : the 15-m@xmath2 model of whw02 has a shallower profile than that of their 20-m@xmath2 model and the 15-m@xmath2 model of nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) has a steeper profile than that of their 13-m@xmath2 model . finally , the older 11-m@xmath2 model of ww95 and the more recent one of whw02 at 11.2 m@xmath2 , while both being steep , are not equally steep in the same regions .",
    "the 11.2-m@xmath2 model has lower densities between interior masses from 1.2 m@xmath2 to 1.45 m@xmath2 , while the 11-m@xmath2 model of ww95 has lower densities exterior to that mass ( not shown ) .",
    "the upshot is that the outcome of collapse and the character of whatever explosion is ignited are not likely to be the same . in particular , the 11.2-m@xmath2 model of whw02",
    "boasts the thinnest mantle of their whole model set , and this is consistent with the explanation given in  [ intro ] for why buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) obtained a sasi- and neutrino - aided explosion , albeit weak , but no such explosion for the more massive cores with shallower and thicker density profiles .",
    "the even - steeper profile of the onemg model of nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) ( not shown on fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) explains the results of kitaura et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and the near - vacuum of the outer envelopes used in the accretion - induced - collapse simulations of dessart et al .",
    "( 2006a ) explains why they saw weak neutrino - aided explosions .",
    "the structures depicted in fig .  [ fig:1 ] translate directly into mass accretion rates ( @xmath12s ) through the stalled shock . because the inner shocked region and the core are out of sonic contact with this mantle , @xmath12 and its evolution after bounce are functions of this structure alone .",
    "hence , for diagnosing and  predicting \" the outcome of collapse , the post - bounce behavior of @xmath12 for a given progenitor is useful , and probably determinative .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] portrays the evolution of the mass accretion rate for representative progenitor models evolved using the 2d mgfld variant of vulcan/2d .",
    "the wide range of curves reflects the range of profiles plotted in fig .",

    "( 2006b ) shows its steep drop at early times , and the corresponding lower accretion tamp .",
    "such a precipitous drop is not in evidence for the other , more massive , whw02 progenitors portrayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .    the plummeting of @xmath12 at later times for the 11-m@xmath2 model of ww95 used in burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is tied to the earlier onset of the sound - powered explosion they witness than we generally find in this paper , employing as we do here a fuller range of progenitor models with shallower density profiles .",
    "the drops in @xmath12 seen at the latest times shown on fig . [ fig:2 ] are consequences of the late - onset acoustic - driven explosions we find , with the 11.2-m@xmath2 model exploding earliest .",
    "probably because our mgfld neutrino transfer can still be improved , we do not reproduce the weak neutrino - driven explosion seen by buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) for the 11.2-m@xmath2 model .",
    "however , determining the precise reasons for the difference will entail a direct comparison of the details of both codes , something that will be subtle . as we show in dessart et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , the luminosities and matter profiles are generally similar for the two codes .",
    "the buras et al .",
    "calculations were done using a gr substitute ; ours were newtonian .",
    "the buras et al .",
    "calculation does a remap between their eulerian ( ppm ) hydro code and comoving - frame ( lagrangian ) transport .",
    "ours does lagrangian hydro , and then remaps to an eulerian grid . buras et al .",
    "calculate spherical transport along radial rays , using for each ray the same eddington factor for an average sphere .",
    "we do flux - limited diffusion , but in full 2d .",
    "buras et al .",
    "do nt include the lateral ( angular ) fluxes in the transport update of the radiation fields ; we do .",
    "we each use a different number of energy groups , placed at different neutrino energies .",
    "one difference is our neglect of the velocity - dependent terms in the transport equation",
    ". buras et al .",
    "calculate the radiation field in the comoving frame , and conclude that their inclusion decreases the net gain .",
    "we do the calculations in the lab frame .",
    "hubeny and burrows ( 2006 ) have included the velocity terms in such a lab - frame formalism and find that the effect _ increases _ the net gain by @xmath110% .",
    "the sign depends on the frame in which you calculate the radiation quantities .",
    "hence , if we were to include the velocity terms it would lead to an increase in the neutrino heating .",
    "however , whether that would make a qualitative difference in our 2d 11.2-m@xmath2 simulation remains to be seen .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the evolution of the baryon mass accumulated in the protoneutron star for a subset of progenitors simulated with vulcan/2d .",
    "when corrected for the binding energy shed during deleptonization and neutrino cooling ( burrows & lattimer 1986 ) , these masses can be used to provide the gravitational masses of the neutron stars ( or black holes ) that remain .",
    "this plot also enables one to estimate the residual baryon mass if the explosion were to occur earlier , since the @xmath12 evolution is fixed by the progenitor structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "one can insert on the plot a vertical line at a given time and read off the baryon mass remaining if the explosion of a given progenitor core were to occur at that time , or one can insert a horizontal line at a given mass to determine the time a given core must explode to leave that baryon mass behind .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] indicates that for the 20-m@xmath2 progenitor of whw02 to leave a neutron star with a baryon mass less than 1.5 m@xmath2 ( equivalent to a gravitational mass of @xmath11.35 m@xmath2 ) , it must explode before 0.3 seconds after bounce .",
    "similarly , for the 25-m@xmath2 model of whw02 to leave such a neutron star , it must explode within the first 50 - 100 milliseconds of bounce .",
    "however , the 11-m@xmath2 and 11.2-m@xmath2 models need not explode before 1.5 seconds to leave behind an object with a baryon mass of 1.4-m@xmath2 ( roughly equivalent to a gravitational mass of @xmath11.28 m@xmath2 ) . in addition ,",
    "[ fig:3 ] can be used to determine the maximum time to the explosion of a given progenitor , and for a given nuclear equation of state , if a neutron star , and not a black hole , is to result ( ignoring any fallback ) . once the mechanism for explosion and the actual progenitor structures have been clearly determined , fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] can also help inform any discussion concerning the progenitor mass at which the bifurcation between neutron star and black hole final products occurs .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] indicates that , for the more massive models shown , leaving behind neutron stars with baryon masses less than 1.6 m@xmath2 would require earlier explosions than we currently obtain .",
    "such  early \" explosions may require relativistic calculations , better neutrino transport , better numerics , different progenitor models , or 3d effects .",
    "however , in this paper , we focus on the general , qualitative effects that emerge from our investigations , and will not claim at this preliminary stage , and given the remaining compromises in our computational approach ( see appendix ) , to have arrived at final numbers .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] depicts the evolution with time after bounce of the radial positions along the poles ( in the positive and negative directions ) of the outer shock for three representative progenitor model simulations with vulcan/2d .",
    "the delay to explosion for all models is @xmath11 second , with the stars with the steepest initial density gradients ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) and the lowest @xmath12s ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) exploding earliest .",
    "though the 11.2-m@xmath2 model of whw02 does not explode within the first @xmath1100 milliseconds of bounce , its shock radius is consistently larger and experiences larger excursions before explosion than the other models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the excursions during the sasi phase range from @xmath1150 km to @xmath1500 km and can be quite dramatic and the explosions , when they eventually occur , are unmistakable .",
    "after the explosion ensues , it takes only @xmath1100 ms for the shock to reach @xmath11000 km . by the end of all the simulations performed for this study ,",
    "the explosion radius has reached @xmath16500 km or more along multiple directions .    however , as fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] demonstrates , and fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , which depicts a color map of the @xmath13polar entropy profile for four representative models , confirms , the blasts are top - bottom asymmetric .",
    "the sasi and the core oscillation represent symmetry breaking and the direction of explosion depends upon the chaotic evolution of the flow and the timing of the explosion .",
    "we see explosions that are very unipolar ( e.g. , our 25-m@xmath2 run ) and more top - bottom symmetric ( e.g. , our 11.2-m@xmath2 run ) . one ca nt predict ahead of time in which direction the core will explode , nor the degree of anisotropy .",
    "however , one can expect that the distribution of the top - bottom asymmetries and the character of these asymmetries can eventually be determined statistically .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] portrays snapshots of the explosion debris a few hundred milliseconds after explosion of the 11.2-m@xmath2 and 20-m@xmath2 models and highlights the different degrees of early blast asymmetry we can expect .",
    "we have seen top - bottom asymmetries larger than that for the 20-m@xmath2 model , but none less than that of the 11.2-m@xmath2 model .",
    "note that we are not concluding anything about the likely progenitor dependence of the explosion asymmetry . on the contrary",
    ", we are merely documenting the diversity we see in this set of numerical realizations .    as fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] demonstrates , the evolution of the mass accretion rate is different for the different progenitors . among other things ,",
    "this translates into accretion rams that are very different from model to model .",
    "table 1 demonstrates another consequence : the sasi shock frequencies vary by more than a factor of 2.5 from progenitor to progenitor and there is a one - to - one relationship between the @xmath12 and the sasi frequency .",
    "we have fourier analyzed the shock position and it is the dominant frequencies that are listed in table 1 , along with the average accretion rates and average shock radii during the non - linear sasi phase before explosion .",
    "oscillation frequencies from @xmath130 hz to @xmath180 hz are seen and these are inversely proportional to the average radius of the stalled shock ( in table 1 , from @xmath1120 km to @xmath1250 km ) . as might have been expected , the monotonicity is with @xmath12 and the shallowness of the density profile , and not the progenitor zams mass .",
    "the oscillation periods implicit in table 1 are approximately the sound - travel - times across the shocked regions . note that this is not a statement about the _ growth _ timescale of the sasi , which is very different and is not the sound - travel time ( foglizzo , scheck , & janka 2006 ) . for the smaller average shock radii that we obtain when",
    "the @xmath12s are larger , this translates into the higher oscillation frequencies for those models .",
    "this is in contrast to the similarity we see in the core g - mode frequencies for the various progenitors : at a given epoch this frequency ranges only modestly from model to model and , for our newtonian calculations , the @xmath5 mode sticks within @xmath130% of @xmath1300 hz .",
    "as we show in table 1 , the average shock radius during the sasi phase is smaller for those progenitors with the highest post - bounce mass accretion rates .",
    "the 25-m@xmath2 model of whw02 is an example of a massive star progenitor with such a high rate . as demonstrated in ott et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , this model manifests not only @xmath5 core oscillations , but significant @xmath14 core oscillations as well .",
    "the latter are responsible for the strong gravitational radiation signature of this published model .",
    "such strong @xmath14 core oscillations are more easily excited if the outer sasi shock oscillations have a strong @xmath15 component as well .",
    "foglizzo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have recently performed an analytic stability and growth - rate analysis of the sasi and find that those models with the smallest ratio between the shock radius and the inner core radius should experience stronger @xmath15 sasi growth .",

    "there is a strong dependence of this power on @xmath12 .",

    "hence , it is when these powers start to decrease due to the reduction of the neutrino luminosities caused by the decrease in @xmath12 upon explosion that neutrino heating can contribute to the explosion energies , and it does so in a transient fashion . as fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] shows , the net effect of neutrino heating from the onset of explosion , which itself in these calculations is due predominantly to acoustic power , is an increasing function of @xmath12 and , approximately , of progenitor mass .",
    "the largest effect of neutrino heating in this model set is for the 25-m@xmath2 model of whw02 and amounts to an integrated value of @xmath12@xmath16 ergs by the end of the simulation near 1.4 seconds after bounce . at this time",
    ", the explosion is still being driven at a steady rate by acoustic power from its massive core .",
    "on the right side of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , we provide the corresponding evolution of the total gravitational accretion power ( @xmath17 ) for the same set of representative models , along with the values for the 11-m@xmath2 model studied in burrows et al .",
    "the accretion power ranges by almost two orders of magnitude , directly reflecting the range in mass accretion rates ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "most of this power is radiated to infinity as neutrinos , without heating ; only a small fraction is converted into the mechanical energy of core oscillations , most of which damps by the emission of sound . due to the chaotic and anisotropic nature of the turbulent flow interior to the shock",
    ", it has been difficult to get an analytic handle on the efficiency of conversion of accretion power into core pulsation energy and acoustic power . however , even the small efficiency we find is enough to ignite and power explosion , after some delay .",
    "neutrino damping of core oscillation seems to be a small effect ( automatically included in our calculations ) , with a characteristic timescale of 5 - 30 seconds ( see ferrari et al .",
    "2003 ; miralles et al . 2004 ) .",
    "artificial damping due to low resolution and truncation errors seems to have a characteristic timescale longer than three seconds .",
    "however , its magnitude is difficult to gauge , given the expense of the simulations , and must be a subject for future studies .",
    "most of the higher - resolution studies ( both spatial and spectral ) we have performed suggest that greater resolution leads to slightly more vigorous core oscillations and sasi , particularly when we increase the number of energy groups .",
    "note that in the models described in this paper , the grid transitions from spherical to cartesian at @xmath130 km , where the radial spacing is still a respectable @xmath1800meters .",
    "such resolution provides reasonable sampling ( @xmath15 zones per decade in density ) of the steep density profile that arises in this region at late times ( @xmath11s after bounce ) .",
    "figure [ fig:8 ] depicts the energy in the g - mode oscillations of the inner core versus time after bounce for a few representative progenitor models .",
    "there seem to be two classes .",
    "the first , represented by the 11.2-m@xmath2 and old 11-m@xmath2 models with low mass accretion rates , achieve pulsation energies ( kinetic plus potential ) of only @xmath110@xmath4 ergs .",
    "the second class is represented by the 20-m@xmath2 model in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] , for which the core achieves pulsation energies near @xmath110@xmath10 ergs . for such models ,",
    "the turbulence of the sasi and the compactness of the shock are much greater ( table 1 ) , and the mass accretion rates are much larger . after explosion commences ,",
    "the inner cores reach quasi - steady states in which the fraction of the gravitational accretion energy channeled into mechanical energy roughly balances the acoustic losses .",
    "this happens at an acoustic power of very approximately @xmath10.5@xmath18 ergs s@xmath19 .",
    "the available accretion energy subsides with explosion ( fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) and so the energy stored in the g - mode within 100 - 200 milliseconds of the onset of explosion may be a measure of the total energy available to be pumped into the supernova  nebula \" acoustically . at a loss rate of @xmath10.5@xmath18 ergs s@xmath19",
    ", the low - accretion - rate progenitors would achieve explosion energies of a few @xmath16 ergs within hundreds of milliseconds and the high - accretion - rate progenitors would achieve explosion energies of @xmath110@xmath10 within seconds , the time it would take their larger core oscillations to discharge acoustically model of ww95 studied in burrows et al .

    "general relativity will increase the core frequencies , and , hence , the core acoustic power , with the result that the explosion might occur earlier and , perhaps , more energetically .",
    "the dependence on the nuclear eos is more subtle and has yet to be studied .",
    "whether the bifurcation into two classes is abrupt , or whether there is in reality a continuum from lower to higher core pulsation energies , remains to be seen .",
    "however , progenitors with larger mass accretion rates seem to achieve larger core pulsation energies , with the suggestion that they can explode more energetically . as the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] also suggests , the neutrino contribution to the explosion energy is expected to be larger for progenitors with higher @xmath12s at explosion , or for progenitors that for some reason explode earlier ( all else being equal ) .",
    "unfortunately , due to difficulties at the outer computational boundary , which must handle simultaneous infall and explosion , and/or convergence problems in the neutrino - matter coupling in the inner core material residing in the transition region from cartesian to spherical gridding when it becomes very violently pulsational and the mass density gradients steepen precipitously , we are not yet able to evolve our models beyond @xmath11.5 seconds after bounce . the code crashes .",
    "hence , we do not quote total explosion energies",
    ". however , the acoustic power being pumped into the explosion ( @xmath110@xmath4 erg s@xmath19 to @xmath110@xmath10 erg s@xmath19 ) and the core oscillation energy ultimately available to the supernova by acoustic discharge ( @xmath110@xmath4 ergs to @xmath110@xmath10 ergs ) give us zeroth - order estimates of the systematics and values of the final explosion energies . from our results , the initial supernova explosion energy seems to be an increasing function of progenitor mass , when correction is made for the slight non - monotonicities noted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "whether this conclusion survives will be contingent upon future detailed investigations , using a variety of techniques and codes .",
    "we note that hamuy ( 2003 ) has inferred from observations of supernova explosions that explosion energies might in fact span a wide range of values .",
    "the explosions we see involve ejecta with distributions of entropies and electron fractions ( y@xmath11 ) .",
    "if the ejecta entropies achieve values in the hundreds , it has been shown that r - process nucleosynthesis becomes more viable ( woosley et al .",
    "we have assembled histograms of the amount of mass in the escaping fraction in the various entropy and y@xmath11 bins . however , since the explosions have not run to completion ( despite the fact that the blasts have reached 6500 km and the simulations have been performed to @xmath11.5 seconds ) , we do not have final histograms for any of our simulations",
    ". nevertheless , the numerical data we do have are intriguing and we present them in fig . [ fig:9 ] for the 11.2-m@xmath2 and 20-m@xmath2 runs .",

    "the iron peak would be produced as the shock encounters and traverses the oxygen shell on timescales typically longer than those of these simulations .",
    "note that an upper bound of 0.5 to the ejecta y@xmath11 was inadvertantly imposed on these runs . since y@xmath11 was not allowed to exceed 0.5 , the potential effects of @xmath25 and @xmath26 absorption for y@xmath11s above 0.5 and/or in enabling the @xmath27-p and rp processes ( frlich et al .",

    "furthermore , our necessary use of an mgfld algorithm , instead of full boltzmann transport , for these multi - d runs should in itself and in any case produce less reliable values for the ejecta y@xmath11s .",
    "the histogram on the left - hand - side of fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , depicting the results for the 11.2-m@xmath2 model with a significant amount of ejecta above entropies of 300 , suggests that the r - process yield of that model is in the middle of the desired range .",
    "we have yet to post - process our ejecta with detailed nucleosynthesis codes , and so our results are at best preliminary .",
    "however , ours are the first consistent supernova calculations that both explode and eject matter with true r - process potential .",
    "the large entropies achieved in the acoustic / core - oscillation mechanism are in part a consequence of the late explosion in lower - density matter and of the compound effects of multiple shocks originating from the multiple sound pulses .",
    "however , neutrino heating of the matter made thinner by acoustic driving is a factor as well . had the supernova explosion ,",
    "actually a wind , been driven exclusively by neutrinos , they would have been responsible for the density profile as well .",
    "the entropies , densities , temperatures , and y@xmath11s of this wind would all have been determined by the driving neutrino luminosity and would have been inadequate to achieve the high entropies necessary for r - process conditions ( thompson , burrows , & meyer 2001 ) .",
    "however , since both acoustic and neutrino driving are simultaneously operative , the neutrinos can deposit energy in material already made thinner by the acoustic effects , resulting in higher entropies than can be achieved by neutrinos alone .",
    "analysis of the contributions of these different agents to entropization is made next to impossible by the multiple and chaotic reflections and reverberations of sound waves and shocks off the walls of the cavity into which the lion s share of core acoustic energy is being pumped .",
    "there is simultaneous explosion and accretion , enabled by the symmetry breaking . given symmetry breaking , and without rotation ,",
    "the explosion naturally generates a cocoon which roughly collimates the outflow . as this cavity",
    "is filled with acoustic power , it expands outward , wrapped by the infalling matter being diverted to the  back \" side , most of which , during the earlier stages of explosion , is still accreted in sheets / funnels onto the protoneutron star ( see burrows et al . 2006 and",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "the sound speeds in the exploding cavity are much larger than the initial speed of the outer shock / explosion wave and the matter is very radiation - dominated ( as the large entropies in evidence in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] would imply ) .",
    "the relatively slow speed ( compared with the speeds of the multiple shocks emanating from the core ) of the expansion of the blast as it works its way out , deflecting the accreting matter on that one side as it moves , allows the entropy of the cavity to accumulate and grow . had the cavity expanded on dynamical times ,",
    "the entropies achieved would have been much lower . in this way",
    ", high entropies are achieved .",
    "since we have yet to follow our simulation explosions to completion , the systematics with progenitor mass of the ejecta entropy , and hence perhaps of the r - process yields , is not obvious . nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] is suggestive .",
    "the explosions we see resemble strong anisotropic winds ( see  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "a spherical wind imparts no net momentum to the residue ; an asymmetric wind imparts a kick and  ablation \" force on the accretion streams and core . the recoil implied is a purely hydrodynamical mechanism , whatever the agency of explosion ( be it neutrinos or sound ) , and has two results .",
    "first , the recoil due to the anisotropic wind pushes the accretion streams to the opposite side , making the accretion very anisotropic . a fraction of the gravitational energy of accretion is used to continue to excite the inner core g - mode oscillation . because the accretion funnels are supersonic , the coupling to the core is non - linear .",
    "importantly , the oscillation of the core can not do work back on the exciting accretion stream(s ) that would otherwise damp the core oscillation ; any work done is accreted back . hence",
    ", the analogy with the swing which requires a resonance or near resonance to achieve significant amplitude is not germane . a steady stream onto the core can continue to power the periodic core oscillation , even though there is no intrinsic periodicity to the accretion . the accretion funnel does have a width , which like a rock hitting a pond has associated with it a range of characteristic sizes ( read wavelengths / wavenumbers ) . due to the dispersion relation of gravity waves between wavenumber and frequency , a whole period spectrum of ripples",
    "is generated which contains the period of the @xmath5 core g - mode ( as well as those of many of the higher-@xmath29 core g - modes ) .",
    "second , the recoil provides a kick to the residual core , the protoneutron star , and this recoil may be the origin of pulsar proper motions .",
    "the anisotropic / top - bottom explosion acts like rocket exhaust and momentum conservation does the rest ( burrows et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the magnitude of the effect can be approximated as follows : the recoil force is equal to @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the average  anisotropy parameter , \" @xmath32 is the characteristic wind velocity , and @xmath33 is the wind mass loss rate .",
    "the  anisotropy parameter \" is defined by this expression and is a dimensionless measure of the dipole moment of the momentum density of the ejecta .",
    "its product with the magnitude of the ejecta velocity yields the net specific recoil momentum . for isotropic ejecta",
    ", @xmath31 is zero .",
    "the power poured into the supernova  nebula \" by the wind is @xmath34 .",
    "integrating both these quantities over time gives the net impulse and explosion energy ( @xmath35 ) , respectively .",
    "the impulse is equal to the residue mass ( @xmath36 ) times the kick velocity ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "taking the ratio of these two expressions results in a formula for the kick velocity :    @xmath38    if we assume that the scale of @xmath32 is set by a sound speed ( @xmath130,000 - 100,000 km s@xmath19 ) , we derive that @xmath39 km s@xmath19 .",
    "the average observed / inferred kick speed is 300 - 400 km s@xmath19 ( taylor & cordes 1993 ; lyne & lorimer 1994 ) , so this number is tantalizing .",
    "the anisotropy parameter , @xmath31 , can be large , but depends on the stochasticity of the flow .",
    "this formula works whether the explosion is driven by neutrinos or sound , and depends only on the wind - like character of the asymmetric explosion and simple momentum conservation .",
    "note that , all else being equal , we would expect larger kicks for larger explosion energies .",
    "whether all else is in fact  equal \" remains to be seen , and this correlation may be only statistical .",
    "we would also expect that the kicked protoneutron star and the _ inner _ ejecta would move in opposite directions .",
    "this is a firm prediction of the model ( see also scheck et al .",
    "2004,2006 ) .",
    "the correlation observed by wang , lai , & han ( 2006 ) between the spin axis and the kick direction would naturally follow in our kick mechanism , as long as the rotation axis sets the axis along which the sasi and the core oscillation break spherical symmetry .",
    "this seems plausible , but whether even slight rotation , that otherwise has only modest dynamical effect , can enforce this axis most of the time will require 3d simulations to determine .",
    "with vulcan/2d we are also able to ascertain for the first time the magnitude and sign of the impulse due to anisotropic neutrino emissions .",
    "we find that during our simulations ( to approximately 1.5 seconds after bounce ) the neutrino recoil effect on the core is not large , at most @xmath150 km s@xmath19 , but that by the end of our simulations it is still growing and is in the opposite direction to the blast .",
    "hence , after the explosion commences , the impulses on the protoneutron star due to the matter ejecta and the neutrino radiation _ add_. figure [ fig:10 ] depicts both the net force and the accumulated impulse due to neutrinos during our simulation of the post - bounce phase of the 13-m@xmath2 model of whw02 .",
    "the negative sign indicates that the neutrinos are emerging preferentially in the direction of the exploding matter ( in this case ,  downward \" ; see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) , and not towards the accreting side .",
    "the small magnitude of the neutrino force during the delay to explosion may seem inconsistent with the very anisotropic accretion .",
    "however , the radiation field is much smoother by its nature than the material field .",
    "importantly , the neutrinos are not radiated instantaneously upon compression in an accretion column onto the protoneutron star .",
    "the matter is too opaque for immediate reradiation .",
    "rather , the neutrinos emerge after the compressed accreta have spread more uniformly over the inner core , and , therefore , are radiated much more isotropically than the matter is accreted .",
    "after explosion , the neutrinos can emerge more easily along the direction of the blast , since the material around the neutrinospheres thins out in this direction , and not along the direction experiencing continuing accretion , which , as stated , is more opaque .",
    "this result is at odds with the conclusion of fryer ( 2004 ) .",
    "figure [ fig:11 ] depicts the spectra of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 neutrinos in the up and down directions ( along the poles ) near the end of the simulations of the 13-m@xmath2 and 25-m@xmath2 models . as fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] demonstrates , the radiation is _ hotter _ in the direction of the blasts , which for these models are in opposite directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "it is also ",
    "brighter \" in those directions .",
    "this is consistent with the sign of the neutrino recoils shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] and our statement that neutrino impulses and wind recoils add .",
    "hence , we conclude that asymmetric neutrino recoil , integrated even longer than we have in this study , can contribute significantly and naturally to the final pulsar kick . however , we can not , at this stage , determine whether the matter recoil or the neutrino recoil will eventually prove the more important .",
    "nevertheless , what has emerged from our simulations is a straightforward mechanism for imparting a sizable kick to the residue protoneutron star that does not require anything but the asymmetric explosion that arises naturally in our calculations without exotic physics .",
    "the acoustic and core oscillation mechanism we study in this paper and in burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) has a number of features that distinguish it from the classic neutrino mechanism . here",
    ", we provide a list of some of its more salient aspects . in arriving at this list ,",
    "we have been guided by the long - term ( @xmath11.5 seconds ) simulations we have performed for this paper that use the mgfld version of vulcan/2d ( see appendix ) , liberate the core , and include the full 180@xmath0 angular domain . calculations that do not have the latter two features , that do not include neutrino transfer , or that do not go to very late times can not be used to study the core - oscillation / acoustic component .",
    "we find that :    * the sasi , when neutrino losses are properly included , does not lead to explosion in and of itself , but creates an anisotropic accretion regime onto the core that eventually leads to nonlinear core pulsation with symmetries ( @xmath29s ) similar to those of the most unstable sasi modes themselves .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath15 core g - mode oscillations can be the most prominent , though the @xmath5 mode arises earlier and generally dominates ( burrows et al .",
    "the acoustic power generated by the core oscillation seems to be dumped into the mantle for many seconds after bounce , longer than the standard neutrino mechanism is thought to operate .",
    "furthermore , it can take many hundreds of milliseconds to @xmath10.6 seconds ( determined by the progenitor mass accretion rate ) before the core oscillation itself achieves large amplitudes .",
    "* during the early phase of the explosion , the acoustic power steadily punches out through the accreta and generates a collimated explosive flow .",
    "this is aided by neutrino heating , which if the acoustic component were suppressed would be the standard underenergetic neutrino - driven wind mechanism ( burrows & goshy 1993 ; buras et al .",
    "the early net velocities of this flow are low , but before and during this phase a cavity is filled with acoustic energy radiated by the core oscillation .",
    "sound waves bounce off the cavity walls and reverberate in the cavity .",
    "* at later times , during what would have been the neutrino - driven wind phase in the traditional neutrino - driven explosion , the acoustic mechanism is still aided by neutrino heating at the level of @xmath110@xmath4 ergs . * the inner , early blast is mostly unidirectional and is naturally collimated by the accretion flow that is parted by the blast and diverted to the opposite side of the protoneutron star .",
    "there is simultaneous accretion , explosion , and core oscillation ( burrows et al .",
    "* the matter that punches out in the explosion experiences a kelvin - helmholtz shear instability which rolls up the interface between the ejecta and the cocooning accreta as the wide - angle  jet \" ( the early explosion ) emerges . however , the coarse outer zoning of our calculations at large radii ( 3000 - 6500 kilometers ) is currently insufficient to resolve this interesting phenomenon properly . *",
    "the explosion is very radiation - dominated ; most of the explosion energy is initially in internal energy , not kinetic energy .",
    "furthermore , the ejecta have high entropies ( 100 - 1000 per baryon per boltzmann s constant , generated by both neutrino heating and acoustic power ) , far larger than the generic values ( 10 - 50 ) associated with the early - phase neutrino mechanism . hence ,",
    "if the acoustic mechanism works , the early development of the explosion into the star and the associated explosive nucleosynthesis can not properly be simulated with a piston or a  kinetic - energy \" bomb . *",
    "the high entropies suggest that some of the ejecta will undergo r - processing ( hoffman et al .",
    "1996 ; woosley et al .",
    "this is the first time numerical supernova explosions have simultaneously and naturally generated the conditions that may be necessary for the r - process .",
    "* our calculations are newtonian and have been done only with the equation of state of shen et al .",
    "general relativity will change the core oscillation frequencies , and so will affect the acoustic power , its evolution , and the timing of the various phases .",
    "consequently , it should eventually be included in the simulations .",
    "the incompressibility of nuclear matter will also affect the g - mode frequencies and , hence , a study of the dependence on the nuclear equation of state would be illuminating and may provide diagnostics of the eos at high densities .",
    "when the sasi is in its vigorous non - linear phase , the @xmath5 oscillations result in quasi - periodic fluctuations in the effective accretion rate and ram pressure on any given side of the inner core . in the canonical neutrino - driven mechanism of supernova explosions ,",
    "when and after the explosion occurs the pressure around the neutrinospheres decays .",
    "when this pressure is sufficiently low , a neutrino - driven wind spontaneously emerges from the inner core , announced and preceded by a secondary shock wave ( burrows & goshy 1993 ; burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 ) .",
    "this is what happens in the standard neutrino - driven scenario when the flow is semi - spherical .",
    "however , the sasi can set up a situation in which the pressure and ram pressure on one side are such that that side of the core becomes unstable to the emergence of a neutrino - driven wind even before the canonical explosion .",
    "in fact , this wind can be the explosion itself and need not be preceded by a primary explosion .",
    "this is what buras et al .",
    "( 2006b ) see for their 11.2-m@xmath2 simulation .",
    "however , such an explosion seems generically underenergetic . in the acoustic mechanism ,",
    "the neutrinos are replaced / dominated by the acoustic power , but the general paradigm in which the sasi leads temporarily / periodically to lower pressures on one side of the core that enable the emergence of an asymmetric wind still obtains . in any case , an aspherical ",
    "wind \" is a good description of the supernova explosion ( see scheck et al .",
    "2004,2006 and burrows & goshy 1993 ) and the breaking of spherical symmetry is the key .",
    "the latter can also enable simultaneous accretion and explosion , thereby solving the problem of the accretion tamp that has bedeviled the theory of the neutrino mechanism for years .",
    "we see in the breaking of spherical symmetry in our simulations and in the unipolar nature of the resulting explosions a natural explanation for the polarizations observed in the inner debris of type ic ( wang et al .",
    "2003 ) and type ii ( leonard et al . 2006 ) supernovae .",
    "inner ejecta asymmetries of 2:1 or 3:1 are easily obtained in this model , and in fact in all modern non - mhd explosion models , and do not require mhd jets .",
    "what the actual and relative contributions of sound and neutrinos are to the supernova phenomenon as a function of progenitor remains to be determined and will require even more sophisticated numerical tools than we have applied here to reach a definitive answer .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper have several limitations ( see appendix ) .",
    "we are doing them in 2d ; 3d , while out of reach in the short term , will be necessary in the long term .",
    "we have employed a mgfld , not a multi - angle , formulation , and the doppler - shift terms in the transport equation have been dropped .",
    "while these velocity - dependent terms are very different in the laboratory - frame formulation ( hubeny & burrows 2006 ) we have adopted than in the comoving frame formulation of buras et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , they should nevertheless be incorporated .",
    "we have used only 16 energy groups ; using more ( @xmath40 ) is preferred ( thompson , burrows , & pinto 2003 ) .",
    "the spatial resolution in the center is good , but can be improved on the outside exterior to @xmath1200 km .",
    "the calculations and gravitational field are newtonian ; we expect that general and special relativistic effects can be important on the inside and outside , respectively .",
    "the opacities employed are sophisticated , but the neutrino - matter correlation effects at higher densities need a second look .",
    "all in all , the supernova problem has resisted attempts at resolution for too long . in the calculations we present here , and in burrows et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we see new , perhaps provocative , ideas emerge that will require fresh approaches to test and verify them .",
    "a potentially new role for the inner core has been highlighted and the intriguing suggestion that acoustic power might compete with neutrino power to ignite the supernova explosion has been put forward .",

    "importantly , though in the past workers focussed on improvements in neutrino transfer and transport , the acoustic mechanism requires special attention be paid to the hydrodynamics , grid structure , momentum conservation , gravity solvers , and , we suggest , a moving grid as well , to ensure and maintain good resolution in the inner core .",
    "vulcan/2d is the first supernova code for which these issues have been central considerations",

    "velocity terms in the transport sector , such as doppler shifts , are not included in the code , though advection is .",
    "note that the velocity terms in eulerian transport are different from the corresponding terms in the comoving frame and that general statements about their relative importance are very frame - dependent .",
    "we parallelize only in energy groups using mpi and in 2d no domain decomposition is required . as a result , and in practice , vulcan/2d is very scalable and the communication overhead is only 2% to 8% of the total run time . the fact that domain decomposition ( such as is used in flash and cactus ) is not necessary , that we can achieve almost perfect parallelism in energy groups , and that we can include rotation , has enabled us to achieve a viable 2d simulation capability .",
    "note that energy redistribution due to inelastic electron scattering is of only modest import on infall , affecting the trapped electron fraction ( y@xmath11 ) and entropy ( @xmath42 ) by only @xmath1@xmath43% .",
    "furthermore , at a neutrino energy of 10 mev , the neutrino - electron scattering cross section is @xmath1100 times smaller than the dominant cross sections off nucleons .",
    "hence , we have not felt it urgent to include into vulcan/2d energy redistribution by neutrino - electron scattering .",
    "fortunately , such energy redistribution , because it is sub - dominant , can be handled semi - explicitly ( thompson , burrows , & pinto 2003 ) , thus avoiding interprocessor communication during an implicit solve .",

    "the grid resolution is essentially uniform everywhere within this @xmath120 - 30 km . a version of this grid structure is plotted in ott et al . ( 2004 ) .",
    "the cartesian format in the interior allows us to avoid the severe courant problems encountered in 2d by other groups employing grid - based codes due to the inner angular courant limit , to enable core translational motion , and , thereby , to perform the calculations in full 2d all the way to the center . in many simulations to date ,",
    "the inner core has been calculated in 1d and grafted onto an outer region that was handled in 2d ( e.g. , burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 ; janka & mller 1996 ; buras et al .",

    "note that due to the grid singularity in spherical coordinates at @xmath46 and the inherent difficulties of constructing a reliable finite - difference scheme and boundary conditions at that singularity ( reflecting ? ) , codes that attempt to include the core in 2d or 3d using spherical coordinates are likely to artificially inhibit translational motion there and , thus , to inhibit @xmath5 g - modes .",

    "<S> we discuss the numerical challenges faced when liberating the core to execute its natural multi - dimensional motions in light of the constraints of momentum and energy conservation , the need to treat self - gravity conservatively , and the difficulties of multi - dimensional neutrino transfer . </S>"
