    "soft gamma  ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are neutron stars whose multiple bursts of gamma  rays distinguish them from other gamma  ray burst sources@xcite .",
    "sgrs are also unusual x  ray pulsars in that they have spin periods clustered in the interval @xmath3 s , and they all appear to be associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which limits their average age to approximately @xmath4 kyr@xcite .",
    "the angular offsets of the sgrs from the apparent centers of their associated supernova remnant shells indicates that sgrs are endowed with space velocities @xmath5 km s@xmath6 , which are greater than the space velocities of most radio pulsars@xcite . anomalous x  ray pulsars ( axps ) are similar to sgrs in that they are radio quiet x  ray pulsars with spin periods clustered in the range @xmath7 s , and have similar@xcite persistent x ",
    "ray luminosities as the sgrs ( @xmath8 ergs s@xmath6 ) .",
    "most of the axps appear to be associated with supernova remnants , and therefore they are also thought to be young neutron stars like the sgrs . here",
    "we present a new look at environmental evidence which shows that the sgrs and axps can not be due to a purely innate property , such as superstrong magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "if the unusual properties of sgrs and axps were due solely to an intrinsic property of the neutron star , that developed independently of the external environment , then the characteristics of the interstellar medium which surrounded the axp and sgr progenitors should be typical of that around the massive o and b stars which are progenitors of all neutron stars . observations clearly show that the majority of neutron stars are formed in `` superbubbles '' : evacuated regions of the ism which surround the ob associations in which the massive progenitors of most neutron stars live .",
    "the supernovae from the massive o and b stars which form sgrs and axps are heavily clustered in space and time and form vast ( @xmath9 pc ) hii regions / superbubbles@xcite filled with a hot ( @xmath10 k ) and tenuous ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) gas .",
    "the occurrence of most supernovae in the hot phase of the ism is confirmed from observations of nearby galaxies@xcite and from studies of galactic snrs@xcite .",
    "it is estimated that @xmath13 of all core - collapse supernova should occur in this hot and tenuous environment@xcite .",
    "the environments of sgrs and axps are probed by the blastwaves of their associated supernova remnants , and from the size of the remnant shell as a function of the age we can constrain the external density . in table @xmath14 we have listed the @xmath15 known sgrs and axps and their associated supernova remnant shells@xcite .",
    "the identification of the associated remnants are based on both positional coincidences of the remnant and the sgr / axp , and on similar distances of the sgr / axp and its associated remnant .",
    "we include the new tentative @xcite sgr candidate 180123 , which appears to be associated with the snr w28 .",
    "the thin sgr error box passes roughly through the center of the snr and through the compact , nonthermal x ",
    "ray source@xcite within the remnant .",
    "no associated remnants can be found for axps 07203125 and 0142@xmath16615 , which is not surprising given the close distance ( @xmath17 ) of 07203125@xcite , and the molecular clouds associated with 0142@xmath16615@xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion and reference list for the sources in table @xmath14 will be published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "most of the sgr / axp positions are significantly displaced from the apparent centers of their associated snrs , as can be seen in table @xmath14 from the ratio of the neutron star angular displacement @xmath18 divided by the angular radius @xmath19 of the remnant shell .",
    "these displacements clearly indicate that the sgr / axps have large transverse velocities . there is considerable uncertainty in the actual velocities , however ,",
    "because the estimated remnant ages are probably uncertain by a factor of two in most cases , which introduces a corresponding uncertainty in the transverse velocities .",
    "in addition , the actual space velocities of the sgr / axps are larger by an unknown factor dependent on the viewing angle . nonetheless , the data suggest that the typical sgr / axps are of the order of @xmath20 km s@xmath6",
    ". such velocities , while much larger than the typical neutron star velocities , are not unprecedented , as @xmath21 of radio pulsars may have space velocities of @xmath20 km s@xmath6 or greater@xcite .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the sgrs and axps are a _ high velocity _ subset of young neutron stars .    in figure @xmath14 we have plotted the snr shell radii as a function of the estimated age of each remnant .",
    "overplotted in solid lines are simple approximations of the evolutionary tracks@xcite of supernova remnant expansion in the wide range of the external ism densities , and we see that these snrs are all in the denser ( @xmath22 @xmath12 ) phases of the ism which slow their expanding shells to @xmath23 km s@xmath6 in @xmath24 kyr .",
    "also overplotted are the tracks of neutron stars born at the origin of the supernova explosion with varying velocities , showing the times required for fast ( e.g. @xmath5 km s@xmath6 ) neutron stars to catch up with the slowing supernova ejecta and swept - up matter .",
    "from the discussion in @xmath25 [ environment ] , we saw that neutron stars should preferentially reside in the diffuse ( @xmath26 @xmath12 ) gas which constitutes the hot phase of the interstellar medium .",
    "as seen from figure @xmath14 , however , the sgrs and axps tend form in denser regions of the ism . given the entire sample of axps and sgrs , the probability that this is merely due to chance depends on the the ability to detect supernova remnants in the different phases of the interstellar medium .",
    "for the sgrs , the detection sensitivity is independent of the interstellar medium , because they are detected via their bright gamma ",
    "ray / x  ray bursts .",
    "therefore , using only the sgrs yields a chance probability of less than @xmath27 , if one accepts the tentative w28/sgr 180123 association , and @xmath28 if one excludes sgr 180123 from the sgr sample .",
    "the axps are also preferentially in the dense phase , which further lowers the chance probability for the class as a whole .",
    "the evidence then suggests that the environments surrounding sgrs and axps are significantly different than otherwise normal neutron stars in a way which is _ inconsistent _ with the hypothesis that the properties of these sources are the result of an innate characteristic such as a superstrong magnetic field .",
    "these observational facts imply instead that the environment is crucial in the development of sgrs and axps .",
    "one plausible scenario is that the rapid spin - down of the sgr / axps may result from their interaction with co - moving ejecta and swept - up ism material @xcite@xcite .",
    "calculations@xcite indicate that such an _ interaction _ scenario , involving the formation of accretion disks by fast ( @xmath5 km s@xmath6 ) neutron stars from co - moving ejecta of supernova remnants slowed to @xmath23 km s@xmath6 by the denser ( @xmath22 @xmath12 ) phases of the ism , could spin - down sgrs and axps to their present - day spin periods in @xmath29 kyr  consistent with the estimated ages of these sources  without requiring the existence of a population of neutron stars with ultrastrong magnetic fields .",
    "in addition , such a scenario can explain the clustering of spin periods , present - day spin - down rates , and the number of sgrs and axps in our galaxy@xcite ."
