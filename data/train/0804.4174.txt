    "in the year 2000 the standard model was believed to be consistent with all known experimental facts ( except the possible existence of a neutrino mass ) .",
    "yet there are many aspects of the standard model which are assumed but not explained : the wave nature of matter , the quantization of the photon ( @xmath0 ) , and newton s second law of motion .",
    "in addition gravity is not usually considered to be part of the standard model , but a separate interaction . with the clear measurement of dark energy by the wmap collaboration@xcite",
    ", it became important to know what makes up the majority of our universe .",
    "the explanation apparently does not lie within the standard model .",
    "this paper investigates the possibility that dark energy is caused by the wave nature of matter .",
    "the resulting model apparently succeeds in explaining dark energy .",
    "it also appears to naturally explain the quantization of the photon and newton s second law , as well as provide an electromagnetic model of gravity .    according to the standard model",
    "@xcite electrons are believed to be point objects when examined on scales as small as @xmath1 m .",
    "recent limits  @xcite show that quarks are also not composites of other objects when examined on similar scales .",
    "however , we know that quarks have _ external _ structure",
    ". they are bound together by color flux tubes@xcite to form hadrons , so that free quarks can not exist .",
    "we here discuss the postulate that the electron is similarly bound to another object by a line of magnetic flux  a quantized vortex in the electromagnetic field .",
    "we suggest that this line may be key to understanding the full meaning of spin . since we model the structure of the electron , it is possible to attempt a calculation of the properties of the electron in terms of planck s constant @xmath2 , the electron charge @xmath3 , and the distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "this is a _ classical _ model in the sense that we attempt to follow the detailed motion of vortex - lines as a function of position in space and time .",
    "the detailed motions of lines are then averaged to find the behavior of waves and particles  normally discussed in quantum mechanics .",
    "we do not follow the copenhagen interpretation@xcite of quantum mechanics , but rather take the view , in sympathy with einstein@xcite , that it should be possible _ in principle _ ( though it would take a rather large computer ) to predict the future course of the universe given _ perfect _ knowledge of the positions and velocities of all lines ( and other objects  hadrons ... ) at a given time .",
    "thus , in this view , indeterminacy is not intrinsic but results from measurement uncertainties .",
    "some authors@xcite would call the positions and velocities of these lines _",
    "hidden variables_. these quantities are difficult , but not impossible , to measure .",
    "of course , all measurement uncertainties are subject to limitations from the heisenberg uncertainty principle , but discussion of the motions of the lines is useful because it can provide underlying structure to relate and interpret more measureable quantities .",
    "this model is a classical model of a quantized superconducting object .",
    "hence it is intrinsically a quantized model in which e.g. newtonian gravity is obtained as an average over the line - pair distribution .",
    "the individual quantum fluctuations are automatically built in .",
    "the classical solution for the motion of electrons and lines appears much like in standard quantum theory .",
    "this model is based on the quantization of magnetic flux in free space ( discussed in section  [ ssec - fq ] , and which we claim was first derived by dirac@xcite ) , which follows from the requirement that wave functions be single valued .",
    "we take this result from quantum mechanics and use it as a general principle which reaches its most general form in equation  [ eq - quantization ] , which implies the relativistic london equations  [ eq - london ] for our superconducting fields .",
    "we make a major assumption in section  [ ssec - electroncharge ] about the origin of electric charge . aside from this quantization condition and our assumption about electric charge , this classical model of a quantized object is based on the principle of least action , or hamilton s principle .",
    "the principle of least action leads to the microscopic maxwell equations which we take to be valid at arbitrarily small length scales :    @xmath4    @xmath5    @xmath6    @xmath7    we generally follow the conventions of jackson@xcite .",
    "the electric and magnetic induction fields can be defined in terms of the vector and scalar potentials @xmath8 @xmath9 which we presume to satisfy the lorentz gauge condition @xmath10 so that the four - vector potential and current density take their standard form @xmath11 @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "however , we deviate from the standard assumptions by asserting that gauge invariance is broken and the electromagnetic four - vector potential @xmath14 , at least sometimes , is directly measureable .",
    "gauge invariance is already asserted @xcite to be broken in superconductors , and this fact is quite relevant to our present dicussion .",
    "we prove below ( section  [ ssec - static ] ) that in a very important special case , our line of flux , the vector potential is unique .",
    "our default reference frame uses flat minkowski space referred to the local rest frame of the universe .",
    "this is defined to be the frame in the region of our solar systsem in which the 2.73k black - body radiation is isotropic@xcite .",
    "we claim that this is a classical model even though it starts with the dirac quantization condition  a quantum mechanical result which implies the structure of our line of flux .",
    "since electron wave functions in standard quantum mechanics have infinite extent , the only way in which they can be single - valued in the presence of magnetic flux is if the lines of flux are quantized and filamentary .",
    "this implies that the magnetic flux in the lines must be contained ( equation  [ eq - ampcirc ] ) . since normal charged particles are not sufficient to contain this flux in general , the most natural assumption we can make is that the flux is contained by a superconducting line , with charge carriers of a new type .",
    "if we take this model seriously , it pays great dividends .",
    "we presume that one end of a line is an electron , the other a positron ( or ends in a proton ) .",
    "thus space - time is crisscrossed by many such lines ( in pairs - section  [ ssec - overview ] ) .",
    "then , in turn , all fundamental quantization conditions  including the dirac quantization condition , the quantization of the photon , and the quantization of matter waves  can be understood from the fact that space - time is a multiply connected superconductor ( equation ( [ eq - multisup ] ) ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies quantum mechanics itself , when the interaction of a bare electron with the flux lines is taken into account ( section  [ sec - quantmech ] ) , and appropriate averages are taken .",
    "thus , the dirac quantization condition , our starting point , is understood at a deeper level and , in fact , implied by our classical model in a self - consistent way .",
    "the classical model implies quantum mechanics , but the reverse is not true since the _ classical _ model is at the deeper level .",
    "( we , of course , take the value of @xmath2 from experiment and we define _ classical _ wave functions which are _ not _ continuous , before smoothing to find the quantum mechanical wave functions . )",
    "we suggest that at the birth of quantum mechanics the problem which the founding fathers solved was not due to the inadequacy of classical mechanics .",
    "they had the wrong model of the electron .",
    "it s not a point particle , but rather the end of a string .",
    "since our method is totally new , it seems appropriate to summarize the highlights of our model to orient the reader  to let the reader know what we will claim :    1 .",
    "our model , many superconducting line pairs crisscrossing in space - time , naturally explains six dominant aspects of everyday physics which are either unexplained or questionable in the standard model : * quantization of the photon ( section  [ ssec - quantphoton ] ) and matter waves ( section  [ sec - quantmech ] ) : @xmath0 * wave - particle duality ( section  [ sec - wpduality ] ) and the wave nature of matter ( section  [ sec - quantmech ] ) * gravity ( section  [ sec - gravity ] ) * newton s @xmath15 law of motion ( section  [ sec - newton ] ) :  @xmath16 * mass of the electron ( section  [ ssec - masselectron ] ) * spin of the electron ( section  [ ssec - spinelectron ] ) and spin of the photon ( section  [ ssec - spinphoton ] ) 2 .   our model gives a natural explanation of dark energy ( section  [ ssec - darkenergy ] ) .",
    "the line pairs are under tension or negative pressure ( section  [ ssec - tensiondarkenergy ] ) .",
    "we have modeled the propagation of the photon as a helical wave on the two lines of a pair ( section  [ ssssec - helicalphoton ] ) . after applying the photon quantization condition and making a binding energy correction ( section  [ ssec - energyphoton ] )",
    ", we calculate the spin of the photon ( section  [ ssec - spinphoton ] ) to be @xmath17 with no free parameters .",
    "our natural model of the bare electron ( end of a line of flux ) has the pole field of a dirac monopole plus a line field ( inside a superconducting sheath ) .",
    "after considering interaction with the surrounding line pairs , the motion of this bare electron is _ zitterbewegung _ ( section  [ ssec - motionbpp ] ) , very rapid motion near the speed of light in rapidly changing directions .",
    "the line pairs completely screen the pole field due to the quantization of magnetic flux so that the magnetic induction field reaching macroscopic distances is zero .",
    "5 .   in order to agree with experiment we must add the electric charge of an electron by hand ( section  [ ssec - electroncharge ] ) to our model of the bare electron .",
    "this is consistent with the principle of least action and does not change the character of the zitterbewegung motion ( appendix  [ ssec - motionelectron ] ) .",
    "the unnatural part of this addition is that the electric charge and effective magnetic charge of the electron must have their relative separation _ fixed _ at a very small distance parallel to the line .",
    "this direction is the direction of the spin of the electron , and the magnitude of the spin is calculated to be @xmath18 .",
    "6 .   using a toy version of our model ( which we hope to be accurate within a factor of 10 ) , we have calculated formulas for newton s constant @xmath19 ( equation ( [ eq - g ] ) ) and the mass of the electron ( equation ( [ eq - me ] ) ) , containing some parameters whose values we do not currently know .",
    "we have also calculated the dark energy density of the universe .",
    "we then combine measurements of the dark energy density , @xmath19 and @xmath20 to calculate the line pair density near the earth ( @xmath21 ) ( equation ( [ eq - fulldensity ] ) ) , which is consistent with known constraints , and a factor of about @xmath22 larger than would be expected without inflation .",
    "our model predicts that the gravitational force will reverse under conditions of very high density .",
    "at least heuristically , this could explain inflation and agn jets .",
    "we offer a new explanation of the pauli exclusion principle . we need to do this since our model ties a string on every electron in the universe , and therefore electrons are _ distinguishable_. the explanation occurs naturally in the model .",
    "we offer a new explanation of the quantum hall effects simply by suggesting that the flux lines seen in these effects are real .",
    "this model amounts to a classical field theory of interacting strings ( or lines ) .",
    "the assumption that lines will condense into pairs avoids having to solve the general case .",
    "we presume that intercommutation is not an issue since all excitations are quantized and excitations with a small wavelengh must have a high energy .",
    "since this model implies quantum mechaincs and @xmath16 for the electron , differences from the standard model should be hard to find .",
    "( but see section  [ sec - relevantexperiments ] . ) in order to restrict the scope of our discussion , weak and strong interactions are essentially not discussed .",
    "we use the word @xmath23 in the title of this paper with some trepidation , because it is an anathema to most physicists today .",
    "if the reader prefers he / she can substitute a euphemism such as @xmath24 .",
    "but we have apparently succeeded in describing the photon propagating as a quantized electromagnetic wave on one of our line pairs  which was the original function of the ether .",
    "we have also apparently succeeded in modeling dark energy , a uniform energy density in space which is widely believed to be inconsistent with the standard model .",
    "this real , measureable energy density is not consistent with the idea of @xmath24 . in section  [ ssec - overview ]",
    "we address einstein s reasons for rejecting the ether concept .    but ( using the language of string theory )",
    ", we may have found the  vacuum selection principle\"@xcite relevant to our universe .",
    "it makes sense that only electromagnetic strings exist outside nuclei , because the nuclear force has a short range .",
    "our selection principle is that every neutron , or electron - proton combination , is the source of a pair of flux lines , probably stretching out to great distances in all directions .",
    "our model gives a reasonable description of dark energy , gravity and the generation of mass without scalar fields .",
    "newton s second law of motion , @xmath25 , is valid only in _ inertial _ frames .",
    "the fact that inertial frames at a given point all move with constant velocity relative to each other implies that acceleration has absolute significance in our universe , unlike velocity for which only relative motion has significance . with respect to what must acceleration be defined ?",
    "mach pointed out@xcite that the mass of the earth and the other celestial bodies must determine the inertial frames .",
    "inertial frames near the earth do not seem to accelerate with respect to the average mass of the universe .",
    "this paper was stimulated by the fact that somehow information on the the average local rest frame of the universe must be present _ at _ each object , to act as its absolute reference for acceleration .",
    "this information could not be carried by a smooth gravitational field .",
    "if we were far from any stars , the newtonian gravitational field would add to zero in a symmetric universe .",
    "somehow the gravitational field of the universe must have _",
    "structure_. it must be quantized .",
    "following dirac@xcite we consider a region of space containing a wave function of a particle of charge @xmath26 .",
    "if a nodal line appears in that wave function , this nodal line can contain magnetic flux as long as the wave function remains single valued@xcite in the presence of the flux .",
    "this requires that    @xmath27    where the path of the integral includes the line .",
    "this implies the quantization of magnetic flux in the line    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the quantum of flux@xcite and @xmath30 is an integer .",
    "this condition is usually@xcite taken to imply that charge is quantized if magnetic monopoles exist .",
    "we reason that electron wave functions fill the universe and therefore we take this condition to imply the quantization of magnetic flux in free space@xcite ( with _ q = e _ ) , which , as we will see , leads in a fairly natural way to the quantization of not only electric charge , but also spin angular momentum  even though true monopoles do not exist , at least in this model .",
    "( the experimental situation on this point is discussed in section  [ ssec - existing ] . )",
    "figure  [ fig - line ] shows the building block of our model  a line of flux@xcite  static , for the moment .",
    "we only consider the case @xmath31 in equation ( [ eq - fq ] ) .",
    "here we consider the case @xmath32 appropriate if the wave function is that of an electron ( charge @xmath3 ) .",
    "magnetic induction field enters through one pole ( labelled @xmath33 ) , continues through the line and exits through the other pole ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the total flux exiting @xmath34 is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the strength of a dirac monopole@xcite .",
    "hence the line of flux is a dirac string .",
    "dirac introduced a singularity to exclude the line from physical reality so that the pole is a monpole . here",
    "we _ include _ the line in our picture of reality and attempt to interpret one end of the line as an _ electron _ and the other as a _",
    "positron_. since we assert that gauge invariance is broken , the position of the line is observable@xcite . note that the total magnetic flux through the positive pole is zero , since we must include the line field as well as the pole field .",
    "we will speak of the total configuration as a _ vortex_. it consists of one line field and two pole fields , one of each sign .",
    "the _ line _ is a _ string _ and we will use both terms , depending on the context .",
    "figure  [ fig - vortex ] shows the vector potential associated with a static vortex / line of flux and indicates why we call it a vortex .",
    "the differential dipole magnetic moment of an element of the line is given@xcite by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 denotes a point on the line and @xmath39 points in the direction of the magnetic induction field along the line ( which we call @xmath40 ) so that the total field of the vortex at the field point @xmath41 is given by    @xmath42    taking the curl of @xmath43 we find the magnetic induction field of the vortex    @xmath44    to 2.6 in     to 2.0 in     to 1.5 in     where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the positions of the negative and positive poles at the ends of the line .",
    "the two - dimensional dirac delta function operates in the plane perpendicular to @xmath47 .",
    "the line is presumed to have no sharp kinks , but it can bend smoothly in an arbitrary manner . in the particular case",

    "lamb@xcite has summarized the classic work on vortices in the 1800 s , principally by helmholtz@xcite and lord kelvin@xcite .",
    "most of this early work was stimulated by the circulation theorem of helmholtz , which showed that in a perfect ( nonviscous and incompressible ) fluid , the circulation of a vortex @xmath53 is an absolute constant , where * v * is the fluid velocity and the path of integration includes the vortex and moves with it . hence vortices retain individual identity so that kelvin proposed@xcite that  vortex atoms \" might be the building blocks of matter ( 30 years before the discovery of the electron ) .",
    "the quantized vortices discussed in this paper bear strong resemblance to the classic vortices with the identification that the vector potential @xmath54 corresponds to the classical fluid velocity @xmath55 and that the magnetic induction field @xmath56 corresponds to the classic vorticity ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the circulation around one of our vortices @xmath58 ( far from the ends to avoid flux returning from the poles ) is quantized , implying that they also retain a separate identity and are good candidates for building blocks .",
    "the classic vortices could not end , so that they either had to form rings or end on the walls of the container .",
    "our vortices , in the terminology of the classic works , actually do not end either .",
    "since the fields of our vortices satisfy the maxwell equation @xmath59 everywhere , technically our vortices do not end at the poles .",
    "their cross sections just become very large at the poles , and the magnetic field extends to infinity in all directions .",
    "there are two major differences , however , between our quantized vortices and the classic vortices .",
    "since our vortices are formed in the electromagnetic field , they have no rest mass and do not sense pressure in the normal way , except at the poles .",
    "( see section  [ sec - pauli ] . )",
    "consequently we must develop new techniques to follow the motions of our vortices .      since we wish to consider the energies of the lines of flux ,",
    "the singular behavior of the magnetic induction field ( equation ( [ eq - singular ] ) ) in the filamentary model is unacceptable .",
    "we need to integrate @xmath60 .",
    "consequently we develop a model of a line of flux with a finite radius @xmath61 , called the _ line radius _ , which we take to be constant . for the moment",
    "we consider only a straight line far from its ends .",
    "we simply use a model of the abrikosov vortex  @xcite which has been successful@xcite in modeling the vortices in type ii superconductors @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the hyperbolic bessel function of the second kind@xcite of order @xmath64 .",
    "the line radius plays the role of the penetration depth in a type ii superconductor .",
    "since the magnetic flux is confined , there must be a current distribution associated with the line . in the static case , from equation ( [ eq - ampcirc ] )",
    "we find @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the hyperbolic bessel function of the second kind of order 1 .",
    "we assume that this current density is _",
    "superconducting_. it is associated with the magnetic field at zero voltage , as in a type ii superconductor . we assume the superconducting region around the line extends to a distance @xmath67 from the centerline , where @xmath68 , so that the flux is contained to any required accuracy",
    ". we will try to measure @xmath69 .",
    "we assume that the current density satisfies the london equations@xcite since , if a coherence length is relevant to this situation , we take it to be negligible .",
    "we treat this current density as a _ field _ , so we can take its charge carriers to be massless ( section  [ ssec - superconfield ] ) . hence the current density is a new concept since it can not be due to the motion of known charged parcicles !",
    "these assumptions seem required by our main point , that , following ( [ eq - fq ] ) , magnetic flux is quantized in free space .",
    "we will see that every wave function contains such lines , and therefore all wave functions superconduct .",
    "this last statement is not surprising ; it is just diamagnetism@xcite .",
    "hence the surprising assumptions which we have been led to make in this section have one reasonable consequence .",
    "we need to see what else is implied .    with this magnetic induction field , or magnetic flux density ,",
    "the total flux through the line at a given point on the centerline is @xmath70 as required .",
    "the self - energy per unit length of the line is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the tension in the line .",
    "the differential magnetic moment of an element of the line is given by @xmath73 also as required .",
    "following the expected behavior@xcite in superconductor we assume a trial solution for the vector potential given by @xmath74 taking the curl of @xmath75 , we indeed find equation ( [ eq - bline ] ) .",
    "but our trial solution has the wrong behavior for large @xmath51 ( see equation ( [ eq - astline ] ) , for points far from the ends ) since @xmath76 for @xmath77 . in order to obtain the proper solution",
    "we must add a field with zero curl ( except at @xmath78 ) @xmath79 which gives the correct long - distance field of the line , so that the total field is given by @xmath80 the curl of ( [ eq - aunique ] ) gives the correct magnetic induction field of a static line ( [ eq - bline ] ) at all points@xcite ( not near the ends of the line ) .",
    "hence ( [ eq - aunique ] ) gives the _ unique _ solution for the vector potential of the line ( for n=1 , not near the ends ) .",
    "it is determined by the azimuthal symmetry of the line and the quantization condition ( [ eq - fq ] ) .      actually equation ( [ eq - singv ] )",
    "is a special case .",
    "the requirement that a particle s wave function be single valued at a fixed time is stated more generally by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the total momentum of the particle , and where we use a notation common in the case that the wave function represents superconducting pairs of electrons . if we extrapolate from the case of superconducting pairs of electrons @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is the number of superconducting pairs per unit volume ) , to our line current density in terms of the penetration depth@xcite @xmath85 ( which has been identified with the line radius ) we find @xmath86 and hence @xmath87 from ( [ eq - aunique ] ) @xmath88 we can find the generalization of @xmath89 to our case @xmath90 which we call the _",
    "phase field_@xcite of the vortex , because , in the case of our vortex , it does not behave like a momentum .",
    "it is independent of both @xmath91 and @xmath84 .",
    "we associate this phase field with the vortex supercurrent wave function .",
    "we say that this new type of current is due to _ aon _ superconductivity , in order to distinguish it from superconduction by cooper pairs .",
    "we will see that this new phenomenon is completely characterized by the line radius , which we call _",
    "evidently , in our model of the core with a finite size , the phase field still has a filamentary curl , and in the general static case it is given by ( see equation ( [ eq - agenline ] ) ) @xmath92 which is just the law of biot and savart .    a supercurrent ( i.e. aon ) wave function will be single valued as long as @xmath93 throughout the region of interest . in general , using the line of reasoning for equation ( [ eq - singular ] ) , the curl of the phase field of a single static vortex not including the ends ( where @xmath89 is not smooth ) is given by @xmath94 the line field itself is quantized precisely so that its supercurrent wave function encircling the centerline is single - valued .",
    "since the curl of the phase field is filamentary , there is no region of space in which the wave function of one line is not single - valued and therefore two lines ( otherwise isolated ) can move through each other driven by their magnetic interaction  with no extra currents ( quantization currents ) needed to make their wavefunctions single - valued@xcite .",

    "this indicates that the whole transverse cross section of the line moves together  as an object with finite size .",
    "this type of motion is required by the quantization condition ( [ eq - intpseh ] ) and by the nature of the superconducting line .",
    "this type of motion is theoretically convenient because the lagrangian density for the filamentary line with interactions ( [ eq - lagrangiandwint ] ) can be used to derive the equations of motion for the superconducting line with only minor modifications .",
    "there is no need to consider added degrees of freedom for the transverse size of the line .",
    "the state of the entire line can still be completely specified as a function of only two parameters , which can still be taken as @xmath200 and @xmath199 .",
    "now @xmath290 refers to the position in time and space of a point on the centerline of the line . because this model is _ acausal",
    "_ , it is also _ nonlocal _ ; the response at a point is affected by a field over an extended region of spacetime .",
    "( see section  [ ssec - selfintline ] . )",
    "the nonlocality of this model makes even self interactions finite , and indeed self interactions are an important part of the model .      in order to consider the superconducting line , we generalize the filamentary model of ( [ eq - filemdual]-[eq - fil4current ] ) .",
    "for instance the electromagnetic field ( [ eq - filem ] ) is a rank 2 tensor in 4 dimensions , because @xmath291 ( and @xmath292 ) are position 4-vectors , the @xmath293-function is lorentz invariant , and the integral formalism shown is independent of the type of parameterization as long as @xmath199 covers the full length of the line , and @xmath200 covers the full time under consideration .",
    "we must modify the @xmath293-function to give the line a finite transverse size .",
    "prescriptions for doing this are frame dependent , so we must start in the transverse rest frame of an element of the line . then we can obtain more general results via lorentz transformation to the lab .    we evaluate ( [ eq - filem ] ) in the transverse rest frame of an element of the superconducting line by making the replacement    @xmath294    where    @xmath295    approaches a dirac @xmath293-function in the dimensions transverse to the line as @xmath296 . here",
    "@xmath297 is the perpendicular vector from the centerline to point @xmath298 and this perpendicular intersects the centerline at @xmath299 .",
    "( if there is more than one such point , we must add the contributions in order to find the total field . ) in the transverse rest frame    @xmath300    @xmath301    where both of these quantities are 4-vectors because @xmath302 and @xmath303 represent the proper time and a length element transverse to @xmath304 in the rest frame of an element of the line .",
    "hence the electromagnetic field in the transverse rest frame of this element of the string is given by    @xmath305    @xmath306    @xmath307    @xmath308    where the matrix contains components of the vector @xmath309 giving the direction of the centerline in the transverse rest frame of the line at the point @xmath310 .",
    "so the electromagnetic field in this frame is given by    @xmath311",

    "in fact the net result of the lorentz transformation , expressed in lab coordinates is the change @xmath320 .",
    "since @xmath318 and @xmath317 are unit vectors , they are , in fact , equal . the directions of the line in its rest frame and the lab are the same . here",
    "we use    @xmath321    @xmath322    and    @xmath323    is the pancaking cylindrical radius of the line expressed in lab coordinates .",
    "by our use of a lorentz transformation we are ignoring the fact that the rest frame of the element of the line is an accelerating reference frame . according to meissner , thorne , and wheeler@xcite this approximation , using a comoving inertial frame , is permissible as long as inertial forces are small and typical accelerations are much less than @xmath324 where @xmath325 is the amplitude of a typical oscillation .",
    "we will assume that these conditions hold true except near the ends of a line .",
    "we wish to use maxwell s equations to find the supercurrent in the lab .",
    "maxwell s equations act at the _ field _",
    "point @xmath41 and therefore we do not consider the explicit space and time dependence of the string coordinate @xmath38 , which acts effectively as a source point .",
    "neither do we consider the explicit space and time dependence of @xmath319 and @xmath326 which is determined by @xmath38 .",
    "however , the field at * x * can change with time due to motion of the string . since the electromagnetic field does not change ( is _ quantized _ ) in the rest frame of the string , all time dependence is due to motion .",
    "so at a fixed field point @xmath41 , the change of the magnetic induction field with time is given by    @xmath327    @xmath328    so for the line ( [ eq - yzline ] ) moving in the @xmath314 plane    @xmath329    here @xmath304 is the velocity of the line at the field point @xmath41 which is the same as the velocity of the point on the centerline @xmath38 associated with @xmath41 , since the cross section of the line moves together .",
    "for similar reasons the change of the electric field with time is given by    @xmath330    and if the line satisfies ( [ eq - yzline ] )    @xmath331    using maxwell s equations we find    @xmath332    where @xmath176 is the instantaneous radius of curvature at @xmath333 .",
    "this current satisfies the equation of continuity ( [ eq - continuity ] ) exactly .",
    "details of these calculations are included in appendix  [ ssec - instradius ] , where the derivatives of @xmath40 are explicitly evaluated .",
    "it is also shown in appendix  [ ssec - calcemfield ] that if we apply equation ( [ eq - generalsol ] ) and attempt to derive the electromagnetic field ( [ eq - efieldline ] ) and ( [ eq - bfieldline ] ) from ( [ eq - supercurrentyz ] ) we do not get precise agreement . we get the expected result plus remainder terms proportional to @xmath334 and @xmath335 which are small for large radii of curvature .",
    "we take this to imply that our simple procedure , which involves giving the delta function a finite size and using a lorentz transfomation from a comoving inertial frame , does not provide an exact solution for the electromagnetic field .",
    "it will be sufficient , however , for our present purposes .    performing an inverse lorentz transformation we find the supercurrent in the rest frame of an element of the line :    @xmath336",
    "the parameters @xmath319 and @xmath326 enter this expression because we have defined @xmath176 in the lab .",
    "( see appendix  [ ssec - instradius ] ) the charge density is zero in the rest frame .",
    "it is shown in appendix  [ ssec - energyofbending ] that the energy of the finite size line is independent of the instantaneous radius of curvature @xmath176 at a given point .",
    "this fact is important because we do not include any term in the lagrangian density for the energy of bending .",
    "so in the absence of interactions , general wave solutions of the type ( [ eq - yzline ] ) and ( [ eq - circularline ] ) traveling in the positive @xmath106-direction could occur with the superconducting line . replacing the argument @xmath337 with @xmath338 produces solutions traveling in the negative @xmath106-direction .",
    "following the sign conventions of bjorken and drell@xcite ( which are consistent with jackson ) the action ( except for weak and hadronic modes ) is    @xmath339    where no mass term appears in the lagrangian because we assert that mass is not fundamental . here @xmath340 is the mechanical string lagrangian density ( [ eq - lagrangiandensity ] ) for line @xmath341 , @xmath342 is the electromagnetic current due to electric charges , and @xmath343 is the electromagnetic current due to superconducting lines . applying the principle of least action to the superconducting line with finite size , using ( [ eq - deltatrans ] ) in ( [ eq - fil4current ] ) , it can be shown that the equation of motion for a given line , instead of ( [ eq - filmotionwint ] ) , is given in the case of interactions by    @xmath344    where    @xmath345    is the average current over the cross section of the line weighted by the shape of the line field .",
    "this averaging must be performed in the transverse rest frame of the line .",
    "but the resulting current is a 4-vector , and can be transformed to any frame ( within the approximations which have been discussed@xcite ) . indeed , since the transverse rest frame varies with the line element in question for solutions of the type ( [ eq - yzline ] ) , it is most convenient for these solutions to think of the quantities @xmath346 , @xmath347 , and @xmath348 transformed from the rest frame to the lab",
    ". then if we wish to make a change of parameterization to the particular parameterization of section  [ ssec - neglecting ] , we can do so .",
    "( it is only important that the parameterization be the same on both sides all equations . )    for a given line we work in the large radius of curvature approximation , @xmath349 , where @xmath350 is the radius of curvature of the centerline ",
    "so that all points which make a significant contribution to the average are perpendicular to the line at a single unique point ( always true for points closer to the line than @xmath350 ) .",
    "to evaluate the interaction of the line with itself , we use equation ( [ eq - supercurrentyz * ] ) in the interaction term and obtain ( with @xmath351 )    @xmath352    @xmath353    where we have used the fact that the radius of curvature of the centerline can be related to the shape of the trajectory ( see appendix  [ ssec - radiusandshape ] ) according to the equation    @xmath354    in order to learn how to transform the radius of curvature from the lab to the line s rest frame    @xmath355    because of azimuthal symmetry the first term in ( [ eq - selfintline ] ) gives a result of zero . unless the radius of curvature is infinite , the second term in ( [ eq - selfintline ] ) is easily seen to be finite but not equal to zero .",
    "in fact if @xmath356 , we obtain    @xmath357    hence we have evaluated the self interaction of the superconducting line .",
    "it is finite and calculable in spite of the fact that the field diverges along the centerline .",
    "the averaging required by the principle of least action leads to a finite result .    because the self - interaction term in equation ( [ eq - eqofmotionwint ] ) is not zero , and traveling waves are an exact solution of this equation without interactions , there are _ no _ traveling wave solutions propagating at the velocity of light for the motion of a single isolated superconducting line once self - interactions are included .",
    "wave motion of a single superconducting line may still be possible when the photon quantization condition is satisfied ",
    "but then the line is not isolated , and we are currently unable to describe the motion .",
    "now we are ready to define what we mean by the wave function of the electron in this model which plays such a prominent role in the dirac quantization condition ( [ eq - singv ] ) .",
    "we define the electron wave function to be the change in the ether caused by the bare electron , i.e. by the end of the appropriate line .",

    "this work has not been done but has promise of uniting general relativity with quantum theory .",
    "the fact that @xmath19 is not constant must be taken into account .",
    "we have not yet done a serious job of studying the dynamics of the ether , e.g. using ( [ eq - fonpairs ] ) .",
    "such a study will be needed for a complete model .",
    "we note that there is an essential difference between line pairs in the ether and the structure of space - time in general relativity .",
    "line pairs are quantized objects which can _ move _ , and are not fixed in space - time .",

    "since we started with dirac s quantization condition ( [ eq - singv ] ) it is not surprising that we are consistent with quantum mechanics with one exception .",
    "we construct a continuous wave function which models the displacement of each line pair in ( [ eq - psix ] ) in the average rest frame ( @xmath282 ) of the electron :    @xmath783    this function is a signed scalar .",
    "it interpolates between the displacements of the various line pairs to form a continuous function , as in standard quantum mechanics .",
    "but contrary to the expectations of standard quantum mechanics , this wave function does not spread out with increasing time .",
    "the electron at rest is at equilibrium with the ether  but subject to zitterbewegung which will manifest itself in slow motion after sufficiently long times .",
    "the whole wave function moves , but does not spread .",
    "this could be a measureable difference between our model and the standard model of quantum mechanics .",
    "thus we see that our electron s wave function is intrinsically localized in position space , but has a finite spread , and therefore must have some spread in momentum space .",
    "hence true plane - wave states do not exist .",
    "therefore we need to modify our discussion of the quantization of the photon ( equation ( [ eq - pepg ] ) and figures [ fig - wfelectron]-[fig - photonfixedz ] ) since we used a plane wave electron for simplicity .",
    "but there is really no essential difference from our previous discussion .",
    "the non - plane - wave electron state is a superposition of plane wave electrons with various values of @xmath784 and we have    @xmath785    for each @xmath784 in the superposition .",
    "this leads to the quantization of the photon ( [ eq - pepg ] ) as before .",
    "we can also obtain the quantization of matter waves by assuming that all matter waves are localized ( to any required accuracy consistent with the uncertainty principle ) in both position and momentum spaces .",
    "if we simply look on a larger scale at figure  [ fig - photonfixedt ] and replace the photon by a localized matter wave , then just as for the photon we will have    @xmath786    where we do not know in advance the precise value of @xmath784 , but presume it will correspond to a value of @xmath787 that is probable according to the momentum space wave function of our particle . in figure  [ fig - photonfixedt ] ( concentrating on the matter wave instead of the photon ) we pick a path of integration along the @xmath106-axis , defined to be parallel to @xmath787 , and integrate over one complete wavelength . from the fact that @xmath158 ( table  [ table - lpdatsurface ] ) is very small , we can do this to any required accuracy , and then turn to integrating over a @xmath368-leg , which is perpendicular to the momentum .",
    "we then use a @xmath106-leg which is far away , well outside the particle s wave function , where the contribution to the total integral is negligible .",
    "we then complete the integral with a @xmath368-leg as before .",
    "hence we obtain as in section  [ ssec - quantphoton ]    @xmath788    then using the standard formalism@xcite we find the momentum space wave function of our electron    @xmath789    in its rest frame . from our previous discussion ( section  [ ssec - masselectron ] ) both @xmath790 and @xmath791",
    "are spherically symmetric , if we sum over spin states .",
    "hence the general wave function of the free electron can be written in the standard form , where    @xmath792    where @xmath793 is no longer restricted to the rest frame . the full wave function , including time dependence is given by    @xmath794    where @xmath784 is the total 4-momentum of the electron . in position space we have    @xmath795    just as in the normal formalism .",
    "this leads to schr \" odinger s equation and the standard quantum mechanics of angular momentum . but",
    "until we have a model of the magnetic moment of the electron , we can not fully discuss spin .",
    "( we could , of course , just take the value of the magnetic moment of the electron from experiment or the dirac equation , as standard quantum mechanics does . )",

    "if we have succeeded in calculating @xmath19 , the entire concept of the planck mass is specious because @xmath19 is not fundamental .",
    "hence general relativity and the hot big bang model , in particular , need modification .",
    "but we can at least heuristically consider the topic of inflation in our model by using weinberg s result@xcite for evolution of the universe    @xmath797    where @xmath51 is the energy density of the universe , @xmath798 is the pressure , and @xmath176 is the cosmic scale factor ( sometimes called the radius of the universe ) .",
    "we suggest that the twoline potential energy ( [ eq - twolinepot ] ) was the energy source for inflation .    in the early universe , after the line pairs started to condense",
    ", we presume that they were radiation dominated , with many excitations traveling on them , so that both @xmath51 and @xmath798 were positive .",
    "the line pair density should have been extremely high so that the fractional concentration of superconductor approached one ( @xmath770 ) and the dielectric constant of the ether was very large ( @xmath799 ) .",
    "thus the effective charge of the electron approached zero and from ( [ eq - ftotal ] ) the gravitational force was initially _",
    "repulsive_. therefore , heuristically , we can think of the value of @xmath19 in ( [ eq - evolutionr ] ) as negative and exponential expansion resulted .",
    "when the universe expanded to the point where the fractional concentration of superconductor became less than 1 , @xmath186 decreased , the force of gravity became attractive and the exponential expansion stopped , as long as    @xmath800    this should have been true through the eras of radiation dominance and matter dominance  until fairly recent times .",
    "using ( [ eq - fulldensity ] ) and ( [ eq - dndanum ] ) , we estimate the expansion factor during inflation to be @xmath22 , with a large uncertainty .",
    "dark energy consists of line pairs which stretch across the universe .",
    "the dark energy density is the energy density of the ether    @xmath801    note from ( [ eq - tensiontau0 ] ) that the energy / length due to the quantization currents has been included in @xmath632 .",
    "dark energy is completely dark .",
    "the only way it can be detected directly is by its gravitational effects , such as changes in a mass moving through it .",
    "the dark energy density decreases with time as the universe expands and the tension of the all the line pairs in the universe decreases slowly .",
    "the pressure due to the longitudinal tension is given by    @xmath802    so for the longitudinal tension alone we would have the ratio of pressure to energy density given by    @xmath803    if there were no transverse tension , we would take the average pressure over three directions and find    @xmath804      but there is tension in one of the transverse directions .",
    "we can easily calculate the transverse tension which the quantization currents need to balance in order to keep @xmath632 constant , for a length @xmath210 of a line pair .",
    "if @xmath805 locates the center of line 2 from line 1 ( section  [ sec - two ] ) , this tension is    @xmath806    the quantization currents could provide this transverse tension simply by flowing in opposite directions on the outer surfaces of the line pair  or they could communicate with other line pairs as shown in figure  [ fig - currentsforapart ] . in the latter case",
    "the transverse tension would be transmitted to other line pairs and    @xmath807    implying that @xmath808 for the ether and from ( [ eq - evolutionr ] ) the ether can contribute to the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "each line pair in this case is under tension in two directions .",
    "we use ( [ eq - me ] ) , ( [ eq - g ] ) , and ( [ eq - rholambda ] ) to estimate the line - pair density of the background ether in terms of the dark energy density , the mass of the electron , and newton s constant @xmath19    @xmath809    we have taken @xmath810 from the wmap collaboration@xcite    @xmath811    in order to obtain an estimate for the properties of the background ether , we guess that @xmath812 so that    @xmath813    we take @xmath433 to be the mean free path in air@xcite    @xmath814    we obtain    @xmath815    consistent with our minumum value from table  [ table - lpdatearth ] .",
    "we note that the line pair density of the background ether is of order 20 times the line - pair density of the sun at its surface . from ( [ eq - dldv ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath816 .      using ( [ eq - rholambda ] ) and",
    "( [ eq - fulldensity ] ) we find the line - pair tension of the universe at the current time :    @xmath817    then again using    @xmath818    we find from ( [ eq - rasmall ] )    @xmath819    we note that our guess for @xmath682 ( [ eq - yminguess ] ) and ( [ eq - ymintyp ] ) looks reasonable since @xmath682 must be @xmath820 , or it would affect the measured pointlike structure of the electron .    to estimate the fractional superconducting concentration of the background ether , we consider the fractional concentration in one volume    @xmath821    and find it to be negligible .",
    "so the dielectric constant of the ether is 1 near the earth and in all circumstances except the most extreme .",
    "since this model predicts the weakening of the gravitational force near strong gravitational sources because of the increasing dielectric constant of the ether , in principle it could account for dark matter . but the very low fractional concentration of superconductor in the background ether from ( [ eq - fb ] ) ( which should be similar in contribution to stars in our galaxy ) appears to rule this out .",
    "we need to discuss what happens to the line pairs , which begin in a star , when it rotates .",
    "if a line pair points along the axis of rotation , nothing happens .",
    "if it is off axis pointing parallel to the axis , it will twist about the axis of rotation .",
    "but this is no problem since line pairs can move through each other .",
    "if a line pair is off axis and pointing perpendicular to the axis , it will stretch and contract as the star rotates .",
    "this is no problem since the first line pair is matched with another line pair pointing in the opposite direction which stretches when the first contracts and vice versa .",
    "hence no net work is done by the star in rotating    however , as a star rotates , each bit of mass @xmath91 does exert a force on the line pairs in its wave function given by ( [ eq - fonpairs ] )    @xmath822    ( where @xmath823 is the cylindrical radius ) .",
    "thus in extreme cases , line pairs will be concentrated on the axis of a spinning mass .",
    "hence we achieve a natural qualitative understanding of agn ( active galactic nuclei ) jets in this model .",
    "the m87 galaxy ( in table  [ table - lpdatsurface ] ) has an agn / black - hole at it s center of a mass @xmath824 , which sends out about @xmath825 line pairs .",
    "many of these line pairs become concentrated on the axis of rotation , apparently sufficiently to reverse the force of gravity , producing jets . the velocities in these jets",
    "are high@xcite , because the particles involved have very low mass , according to ( [ eq - me ] ) because @xmath826 becomes small .",
    "( actually if the force of gravity reverses , the dominant contributions to the mass ( [ eq - metau0 ] ) from ( [ eq - ftotal ] ) are repulsive , but we can still expect the mass to be small . )",
    "we have tied a string onto every electron in the universe , therfore electrons are _",
    "distinguishable_. this removes the theoretical underpinnings of the exclusion principle , which apparently pauli never believed@xcite anyway . but something must replace these underpinnings .",
    "we suggest that the pole force of the electron does part of the job .",
    "the pole has the strength of a dirac monopole ( if @xmath502 near the earth ) .",
    "screening currents tend to amplify the strength of the pole if you are in _ contact _ with the electron , i.e. inside the screening currents .",
    "so there should be _ very _ strong forces between electrons ( i.e , any objects ) in contact .",
    "we suggest the pole field of the electron is responsible for the impenetrability of matter . if you push down on a table , we suggest that the force which pushes back on you is the contact force of the pole fields of the electrons in the table .",
    "( hence our lines sense pressure only at the ends . )",
    "we postulate that the rest of the job is done by the line forces between electrons .",
    "the line force has infinite range , as does the spin glass spin - spin correlation length@xcite .",
    "we also suggest that the line force is responsible for the _ exchange _ force of ferromagnetism .",
    "elliot lieb has said@xcite that the reason the pauli exclusion principle is not a force is that you can not write it in hamiltonian form .",
    "so calling it a force is perhaps appropriate for this classical model .",
    "the line force between two electrons provides a strong attractive force between separated electrons of opposite spin .",
    "apparently any attractive force between electrons can lead to cooper pairs@xcite , so we expect the line forces between two electrons to contribute to the formation of cooper pairs , and hence that form of superconductivity .",

    "the isotope effect played a strong role in establishing the original cooper pair mechanism .",
    "the quantum of flux in a cooper pair system is @xmath827 , because the charge is due to two electrons .",

    "i.e. whether to bring the flux to @xmath64 or @xmath828 we postulate that this position of unstable equilibrium with the ether currents is enough to let the cooper pair currents keep the flux steady at @xmath827 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if line forces between electrons contribute strongly to the formation of cooper pairs , then line pairs are pretty much the same thing as cooper pairs in a superconductor  and hence appropriate to the generation of mass@xcite according to some authors .",
    "the integer quantum hall effect can be taken@xcite as direct evidence for the quantization of magnetic flux in units of @xmath828 . in the fractional quantum hall effect",
    ", it is suggested@xcite that composite fermions are formed when one electron binds an even number of flux quanta ( @xmath828 ) .",
    "the fractional quantum hall effect is then explained when these composite fermions undergo the integer quantum hall effect , as if they were electrons .",
    "the currents needed to contain these flux quanta are not obviously available , so we suggest that the quantum hall effects present direct evidence for our unpaired lines of flux ( section  [ ssec - static ] ) .",

    "for common mode motion with the line separation perpendicular to the motion , we have shown that the interaction terms in ( [ eq - intcommode ] ) sum to zero and therefore solutions of type ( [ eq - yzline ] ) can propagate at the speed of light on the two lines of an isolated pair .",
    "now we would like to consider a line pair moving in the @xmath314 plane with the line separation also in the @xmath314 plane . in common mode",
    "the separation of the centerlines is fixed at @xmath912 perpendicular to both centerlines .",

    "so    @xmath919    @xmath920    we find that ( [ eq - lm1 ] ) and ( [ eq - lm2 ] ) become    @xmath921    @xmath922    so the total lagrangian becomes    @xmath923    identical to @xmath251 in ( [ eq - lm ] ) .    as in section  [ sssec - commonmodesol ]",
    "the common mode interaction terms add to zero when both lines are referenced to the common mode centerline .",
    "the two lines do not bend so that they have precisely the same shape .",
    "they have the same center of curvature when referenced to the common mode centerline , so that their individual centerlines have _ different _ radii of curvature but the radii of curvature of the fields are identical at any point    hence we get the same equations of common mode motion with the separation perpendicular to the plane of the motion as we get if the separation is in the plane of the motion .",
    "therefore we presume that the orientation of @xmath402 makes no difference to the common mode motion , and common mode solutions ( gravitational waves ) of type ( [ eq - circularline ] ) can also propagate at the speed of light on an isolated line pair .",
    "following the reasoning of section  [ ssec - motionbpp ] we have shown how the equations of motion of the the bare positron - pole ( [ eq - bpptmotion]-[eq - bpp3motion ] ) are solved in the case that @xmath924 ( where @xmath162 and @xmath56 refer to external fields ) . if @xmath317 is at an angle @xmath925 from the magnetic induction field @xmath56 and @xmath926 as shown in figure  [ fig - orientation ] , then from ( [ eq - bpplmotion ] ) and ( [ eq - bpp3motion ] ) we find    @xmath927    @xmath928 + b_0 \\sqrt{b_0 ^ 2 + e^2 cos^2(\\theta+\\alpha ) - b^2 cos^2(\\theta ) } }   \\over { b_0 ^ 2 + e^2cos^2(\\theta+\\alpha ) } } \\label{eq - transcendental}\\ ] ]    which is the transcendental equation which must be solved for @xmath834 given @xmath248 , @xmath929 , and @xmath584 .",
    "if @xmath584 is small , we presume that @xmath834 will be small and @xmath579 is fixed , since all the cosine terms in ( [ eq - transcendental ] ) are equal to @xmath114",
    ". then we have    @xmath930    @xmath931    showing that the orientation of @xmath838 is easily determined if @xmath584 is small .    to 3.0 in       the electric charge at the end of each line",
    "is easily incorporated into the principle of least action using the electric charge current in ( [ eq - actionnoh ] ) .",
    "the only unnatural requirement for this model is putting the charge and pole at ( nearly ) the same position at the end of each line , so that the end of a line becomes a almost a dyon , with a spin dependent magnetic charge . with both electric and magnetic charge ,",
    "equation ( [ eq - motionepparts ] ) , the boundary condition to be satisfied at the end of each line , becomes :    @xmath932    we evaluate the boundary condition just outside the end of each line so that the electric charge is included .",
    "the pole self field is continuous so we can evaluate it just inside the line as we did in section  [ ssec - selfintbareelectronpole ] .",
    "the self field of the electric charge will be finite if we average over the cross section of the end of the line .",
    "then , since we switch to the point charge approximation to evaluate the motion of the bare positron , we can argue that the electric self energy is zero from symmetry .",
    "it is easy to see that the cross terms in the self energy are zero . evaluating them in the rest frame of the positron where @xmath933",
    ", we see that the pole only interacts with a magnetic field , whereas the charge only interacts with an electric field .",
    "hence the self - energy terms are unchanged from the case of the positron - pole and the equation of motion becomes    @xmath934 \\label{eq - eqofmotionwcharge}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath935    is a small number if @xmath936 near the earth ",
    "implying that the motion of the bare positron is dominated by the pole , which is much stronger than the charge .",
    "we can show this directly by combining terms in ( [ eq - eqofmotionwcharge ] ) to find    @xmath937    that the motion reduces to the case of the bare positron - pole .",
    "we simply make the substitutions    @xmath938    @xmath939    and the equation of motion of the bare positron reduces to the equation of motion of the bare positron - pole , in terms of these transformed fields .",
    "this model of the positron ( using positive charge for convenience ) has an electric charge of @xmath193 , a screened magnetic pole field of effective magnetic charge @xmath194 , and a line field that ensures that the total magnetic flux leaving the positron is zero .",
    "hence our positron ( assuming @xmath940 near the earth ) has the expected electric charge but no true magnetic charge .",
    "it has a magnetic dipole moment , which we are currently unable to model",
    ". therefore our model of the positron should behave like a physical positron if we assume that the positron s measured magnetic dipole moment is consistent with our model .",
    "the short answer to this question is no .",
    "the string tension is quantized and therefore can not transmit an increase in force to the positron .",
    "the string is perfectly elastic .",
    "if you pull on it in the direction of the string , you simply increase the string s length and do not affect the positron s motion .",
    "however , if you pull on the string perpendicularly to the string , you can affect the orientation of the string , and thereby change the positron s motion .",
    "so this fact brings out the importance of spin and developing a model of the magnetic moment that will be needed to make this model complete .",
    "following the line of reasoning which led to ( [ eq - dndastar ] ) and hence to ( [ eq - g ] ) , the line pair density coming from a star of arbitrary material is given by    @xmath941    where @xmath942 is one atomic mass , @xmath943 is the mass number of the material ( number of nucleons ) and @xmath944 is the relative atomic mass of the material .",
    "the brackets indicate the mass weighted mean and the subscript @xmath945 indicates that the ratio of the line pair density from a star to its mass depends on the material of the active mass ( source of the field ) .",
    "then the value of @xmath946 becomes    @xmath947    the size of the material dependence factor is typically @xmath948 .",
    "this factor approaches @xmath689 for hydrogen , but it is difficult to measure @xmath19 with a gas .",
    "there are wild fluctuations@xcite in existing measurements of @xmath19 and this model may be able to help@xcite bring understanding to these measurements .    this model can not assess whether or not the gravitational force is proportional to passive mass ( on which the field acts ) because we do not model the nucleus .",
    "the discussion of section  [ ssec - calcg ] indicates that when a line pair passes a charged particle , it will exert an attractive force on this particle , and this force will switch directions as the line pair passes .",
    "hence the force of a line pair on a particle _ will _ depend on the velocity of the line pair .",
    "if line pairs in our surroundings dominantly come from stars we can see , the  fixed \" stars , we expect that the force of the ether on a charged particle _ will _ depend on the velocity of the particle , instead of only on the acceleration of the particle .",
    "however , we have seen that the average line pair ( section  [ ssec - estimatelpd ] ) is about a factor of @xmath22 larger than the size of our visible universe , probably because of inflation .",
    "this indicates that the total volume of our universe is about a factor of @xmath949 greater than the volume of our visible universe !",
    "matter which went over our horizon early in the inflationary process will now be moving at velocities far beyond the velocity of light relative to us , but may have stars which are the source of line pairs near us .",
    "thus we postulate that the line pairs near us are moving isotropically with uniformly distributed velocities at least up to the velocity of light .",
    "this causes lorentz invariance .",

    "<S> this is an attempt to construct a _ classical _ microscopic model of the electron which underlies quantum mechanics . </S>",

    "<S> these lines stretch across cosmic distances , but are almost unobservable because they condense into pairs  which form the ether . </S>",
    "<S> photons are modeled to propagate on these line pairs , which act effectively as wave guides . </S>",
    "<S> these line pairs are also responsible for the force of gravity  which is electromagnetic in character .    using our classical interpretation of an electron as a quantized electromagnetic field </S>",
    "<S> , we find that we achieve a natural interpretation of not only quantum mechanics , but also mass , spin , mach s principle , gravity , self interactions , newton s second law of motion , the quantization of the photon , wave - particle duality , inflation , dark energy , agn jets , the pauli exclusion principle , superconductivity , and the quantum hall effects . </S>",
    "<S> mass generation and inflation are discussed without the use of scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to calculate newton s gravitational constant g , the mass of the electron , the spin of the electron , and the spin of the photon  all in terms of planck s constant , the charge of the electron , the outer radius of a line , and the distribution of matter in the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of this model and the standard model are both compared to experiment , emphasizing areas where the predictions differ .    </S>",
    "<S> this model s remaining problems are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> this model is a classical field theory of interacting strings which explains a large number of diverse phenomena , even though it does not discuss the strong or weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> since the ether of this model is quite well determined , it might be useful in restricting the landscape of vacua in more complete string theories . </S>"
