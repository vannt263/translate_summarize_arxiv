    "the knowledge of the extragalactic radio sources at frequencies higher than 10 ghz is still poor , although the situation has been improving rapidly in recent years , thanks especially to the 9c @xcite , at20 g @xcite , 10c @xcite , wmap @xcite , and _ planck",
    "_ @xcite surveys .",
    "the study of extragalactic sources at millimeter wavelengths is important both per s and in connection with cmb experiments , since these sources are the main astrophysical contaminant of cmb maps on angular scales smaller than @xmath5@xmath6 at frequencies of up to @xmath7ghz .",
    "_ planck _ offers a unique opportunity to carry out an unbiased investigation of the spectral properties of radio sources in a poorly explored frequency range , partially unaccessible from the ground .",
    "a definition of sources spectral energy distributions ( seds ) over a frequency range as large as possible is crucial in determining their physical properties and in identifying the different components that may contribute to their emission . given that observations in the full _ planck _ frequency range will not be repeatable at least in the foreseeable future , it is essential not to lose the occasion , while _",
    "planck _ is flying , of greatly increasing its science yields by simultaneous ( i.e. not affected by variability ) ground based observations at lower frequencies as well as at frequencies overlapping with _",
    "planck _ channels .",
    "this has motivated the _",
    "planck_-atca co - eval observations ( paco ) project , that consisted in observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at several frequencies between 4.5 and 40 ghz , almost simultaneously with the _ planck _ satellite . in the period between july 2009 and august 2010 we observed 482 extragalactic sources , extracted from the australia telescope 20 ghz ( at20 g ) survey catalog @xcite . of these ,",
    "344 sources form 3 partially overlapping complete sub - samples , selected for different purposes .    * the paco faint sample , presented in this paper ,",
    "is made of 159 sources with @xmath8 mjy in the south ecliptic pole region ( ecliptic latitude @xmath9 ) and with @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "near the ecliptic poles _ planck _",
    "s scan circles intersect .",
    "therefore the area is covered many times , and _",
    "s sensitivity is maximal .",
    "* the paco spectrally - selected sample comprises the 69 sources with @xmath12 mjy and inverted or upturning spectra in the frequency range 520 ghz , selected over the whole southern sky ; * the paco bright sample comprising the 189 sources with @xmath13mjy at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a full description of the paco project and of its main goals is given in @xcite .",
    "the aims specific to the paco faint sample are :    * extend to fainter flux densities the characterization of radio source spectra from 4.5 ghz to the _ planck _ frequency range .",
    "although _ planck _",
    "s sensitivity is maximal in the selected area , we expect that only a minority of sources in this sample will be detected by _ planck_. the estimated completeness limits of the _ planck _ early release point source catalog ( ercsc , * ? ?",
    "* ) are of 1 and 1.5 jy at 33 and 40 ghz , respectively @xcite , and the minimum flux density of an ercsc extragalactic source is of 480 mjy at 30 ghz and of 585 mjy at 44 ghz @xcite .",
    "only 57 paco faint sources have ercsc flux density measurements at least at one frequency .",
    "the final catalog is expected to reach deeper flux density limits @xcite but , nevertheless , we will probably get the full _ planck _ spectral coverage only for a subset of sources in this sample",

    "extend the determination of source counts at @xmath14 and @xmath1 ghz obtained from the analysis of the ercsc @xcite downwards in flux density by a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "going down in flux density is important to control the contamination of cmb maps by faint radio sources .",

    "sam ] we summarize the main steps of data acquisition , reduction and calibration . in ",
    "[ sec : sample ] we describe the paco faint sample . in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we analyze the spectral behaviour between 4.5 and 40 ghz of our sources , their variability , and estimate the differential source counts at 33 and 40 ghz .",

    "a detailed description of observations , data reduction and calibration can be found in @xcite . here",
    "we present only a brief summary of the main points .",
    "the observations exploited the capabilities of the new compact array broadband backend ( cabb , ferris & wilson 2002 , wilson et al .",
    "2011 ) system , that allows to observe @xmath15 ghz simultaneous bands in continuum .",
    "each band is split into @xmath16mhz frequency channels . applied to the @xmath17 m antennas of the australia telescope compact array ,",
    "the cabb gives a noise level per band reaching 0.5 mjy in 1 min on source down to the 7 mm wavelength band .",
    "we chose to use the receivers at 7 mm ( intermediate frequencies , ifs , at 33 and 39 ghz ) , to overlap the lower - frequency _ planck _ channels , at 12 mm ( ifs at 18 and 24 ghz ) to overlap our selection frequency , and at 3 - 6 cm ( ifs at 5.5 and 9 ghz ) to extend the seds to lower frequencies .",
    "since most of the sources are point - like we can observe with any array configuration .",
    "the dates of the observing runs , the telescope configurations and their properties are summarized in tables 1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "the project was allocated 62 observing runs , for a total of @xmath18 hours . for each run and for each frequency",
    ", we observed a bandpass calibrator and a primary calibrator .",
    "thanks to the compactness of most of the paco sources neither imaging nor phase calibration is necessary , but since sources are self - calibrated we get good images when observing with hybrid arrays .",
    "we got a suitable flux density estimation from the visibilities using the triple - correlation techniques .",
    "each target source has been observed in a single 1.5 min - long shot for each frequency , that corresponds to a theoretical noise of less than 1 mjy .",
    "observations were generally made within 10 days from the _ planck _ scan on any given source .",
    "an effort was made to observe sources in all the three bands ( 7 mm , 12 mm and 3 - 6 cm ) during the same run .",
    "exceptions are due to bad weather conditions .",
    "the sources have been re - observed in several runs overlapping with the _ planck _ observations ( the satellite surveys the whole sky every 6 months ) , with a higher observing rate for the sources that appeared more variable .    for data reduction we used the miriad software @xcite ,",
    "recently updated to deal with cabb data .",
    "we inscribed miriad tasks within a scripting pipeline for consistency in the analysis , and have independently reduced the data from each observing run and each frequency . after flagging the time intervals affected by bad weather or instrumental failures we have split the @xmath192 ghz bands in 4@xmath20 mhz sub - bands to exploit the spectral information .",
    "we have calibrated each sub - band for bandpass , flux density and leakages .",
    "the classification of sources as point - like or extended was mostly taken from the at20 g catalogue and integrated at 7 mm by the analysis of the source phase closure and ratio between the data collected with long baselines and those collected with the whole array .",
    "the flux densities , and the associated errors , for point - like sources were computed using the triple product @xcite . for extended sources we used the scalar flux density on the shortest baseline which",
    ", however , is only a lower limit to the real flux density .",
    "we have in total 9 extended sources in the paco faint sample , only 4 of which were classified as extended in the at20 g catalog .",
    "at the end of the process , a quality check on the data has been performed comparing the data points with a polynomial fit to the source seds .",
    "this approach assumes that the seds of our sources are smooth across our frequency range .",
    "misbehaving points are attributed to frequency dependent problems , not addressed by the automatic flagging that operates within each bands .",

    "since the differential counts below the completeness limits of the ercsc ( @xmath25jy at 30 ghz and @xmath26jy at 44 ghz , @xcite ) go roughly as @xmath27 , the power spectrum of poisson fluctuations due to sources fainter than @xmath24 goes as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the beam solid angle .",
    "this means that @xmath30 per cent of the residual point source fluctuations in _",

    "note that fluctuations due to clustering , not taken into account in the above equation , are negligible in the case of radio sources because of the strong dilution due to the broadness of the luminosity function .",
