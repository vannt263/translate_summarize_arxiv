    "the accretion disk limit cycle model was proposed twenty years ago to account for the semi - periodic outbursts seen in dwarf novae ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ) .",
    "dwarf novae are a subclass of the cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) @xmath1 interacting binary stars in which a roche lobe filling k or m star transfers material through the inner lagrangian point into an accretion disk about a white dwarf ( wd ) primary ( warner 1987 , 1995 ) .",
    "dwarf novae are defined by their outbursts , which recur on intervals of between days and decades , and have amplitudes of several magnitudes .",
    "the limit cycle model posits that the rate of mass transfer into the outer part of the disk from the mass losing star is constant on long time scales .",
    "( actually in the am her subclass of cvs , for which the wd is so strongly magnetized that no disk can form , one sees strong , chaotic variations in the mass transfer rate from the secondary star [ see fig . 3 of schreiber , gnsicke , & hessman 2000 ] . the mass losing secondary stars in cvs should not differ between subclasses , so highly variable mass transfer should also be the rule in dwarf novae . for the non - magnetic systems however , the accretion disk about the wd acts like a low - pass filter which responds only to slow variations @xmath1 those occurring on time scales that are long compared to the viscous time in the outer disk @xmath5 yr . ) the accretion disk limit cycle model is based on the theoretical finding that the steady state relation between effective temperature @xmath6 and surface density @xmath7 at a given radius forms a hysteresis with two stable branches @xmath1 one for ionized gas and one for neutral gas . when a series of steady state solutions for a given radius and varying rate of accretion @xmath8 are plotted as @xmath6 versus @xmath7 , one sees an s - shaped curve .",
    "the basic idea is that in the quiescent state of dwarf novae , matter is accumulating and the mass of the accretion disk is increasing .",
    "the mass flow within the disk is highly non - steady , and the rate of removal of mass from the inner disk is many orders of magnitude below that at which it is being fed at the outer edge . in the outburst state the opposite holds",
    "@xmath1 the rate of mass removal from the inner disk onto the central accretor exceeds the rate of mass supply to the outer disk edge which results in a decrease of disk mass .",
    "thus , both the high and low state disks are unstable in the sense that they continually attempt to revert to the opposite state . for recent reviews see osaki ( 1996 ) , cannizzo ( 1993a , 1998c ) .",
    "following the initial vertical structure papers which established the physical underpinnings for the limit cycle idea ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1982 , cannizzo , ghosh , & wheeler 1982 , cannizzo & wheeler 1984 , smak 1984 , faulkner , lin , & papaloizou 1983 , mineshige & osaki 1983 ) , workers began to explore detailed aspects of the model using time dependent codes ( papaloizou , faulkner , & lin 1983 , lin , faulkner , & papaloizou 1985 , smak 1984 , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1984 , mineshige & osaki 1985 , cannizzo , wheeler , & polidan 1986=cwp , cannizzo & kenyon 1987=ck , pringle , verbunt , & wade 1986=pvw ) .",
    "more recent time dependent work has concentrated on the development of increasingly sophisticated numerical models which are utilized to study different systematic effects inherent in the calculations ( e.g. , mineshige 1988 , ichikawa & osaki 1992 , 1994 , cannizzo 1993b = c93b , ludwig , meyer - hofmeister , & ritter 1994 , ludwig & meyer 1998 , hameury et al .",
    "1998 , menou , hameury , & stehle 1999 , truss et al .",
    "2000 , buat - meard , hameury , & lasota 2001=bhl ) .",
    "these later studies represent an advancement over the earlier ones , but some of the difficulties in reconciling theory with observation remain .",
    "for instance , bhl present global time dependent computations ( using the model described in hameury et al . 1998 ) which include the effects of heat input due to the stream - disk impact and tidal torque . they show that such models produce sequences of alternating long and short outbursts triggered at large radii that have similar peak luminosities , thereby rectifying some of the difficulties evident in the computations of c93b .",
    "figure 7 of bhl shows a change in sequencing from all short to all long outbursts as the secondary mass transfer rate @xmath9 is made to increase , while their figure 4 shows a decrease in the inter - outburst quiescent intervals with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "combining these results gives a prediction that @xmath10 @xmath11 the moving long term average of the ratio of number of long to short outbursts in a long time series ( during which there are variations in @xmath9 ) @xmath1 should be anti - correlated with @xmath12 @xmath1 the moving long term average of the quiescent interval . in other words , if long term variations in @xmath13 occur and affect the outbursts , then during times when @xmath13 is larger and therefore more long outbursts are occurring , the quiescent intervals should be shorter .",
    "the long term light curve of ss cygni shows the opposite : a strong positive correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath12 ( see figs .",
    "14 and 15 of c93b ) .    one observation of interest is the delay between the rise of the optical and @xmath0 fluxes in so - called `` fast - rise '' outbursts which are seen in several dwarf novae . for these systems one sees",
    "the optical begin to rise about 1 d before the @xmath0 .",
    "this is accounted for in the model by the fact that the optical flux , which is weighted basically by the emitting area of the disk , arises predominantly at large radii , while the @xmath0 flux comes from small radii close to the wd ( cannizzo 1996 , 1998a ) .",
    "therefore the delay represents the time for the heating transition wave which communicates the onset of thermal instability to travel from large radii where the instability begins down to the wd . the earliest studies to explore the @xmath3 delay found a basic consistency between theory and observation ( smak 1984 , cwp ) , while later workers found an apparent discrepancy ( pvw , ck ) .",
    "mineshige ( 1988 ) presents a detailed time dependent study of the rise to outburst using more sophisticated input physics than some of the earlier workers .",
    "in particular , he uses physically realistic values of the specific heat as a function of density and temperature @xmath14 , and finds a `` stagnation '' stage in the early phase of the outburst during which the disk midplane temperature is stalled at @xmath15 k due to the large @xmath16 .",
    "some other aspects of his model rely on detailed @xmath17 features near the local maximum in surface density @xmath18 which depend strongly on specifics of the vertical structure calculations .",
    "smak ( 1998 ) presents a thorough investigation of the problem , and traces the failure of the later workers to their inability to produce outbursts which begin at sufficiently large radii .",
    "the reason this is critical is at least partly due to the fact that outbursts which begin too close to the inner edge , referred to as `` inside - out '' outbursts ( cwp ) or `` type b '' outbursts ( smak 1984 ) , have a fundamentally different shape than outbursts which begin at large radii , which are referred to as `` outside - out '' outbursts ( cwp ) or `` type a '' outbursts ( smak 1984 ) .",
    "basically , type a outbursts have a fast rise , and type b outbursts have a slow rise .",
    "the difference has to do with the rate of enhancement of surface density in the inner disk during the early stage of the outbursts ( see cwp for an explanation ) .",
    "furthermore , the dividing line between these two types of outbursts is quite sharp @xmath1 for a triggering or instigation radius @xmath19 less than some critical radius @xmath20 one obtains type b outbursts , whereas for @xmath21 , type a outbursts occur ( see fig .",
    "6b of cannizzo 1998b ) . in summary ,",
    "in order to obtain the needed delay one requires an outburst which triggers at a sufficiently large radius so that it is not only type a , but also that the time for the heating front to travel to the inner disk edge @xmath22 is long enough to equal the observed @xmath23 .",
    "smak ( 1998 ) shows that the flux distributions utilized in the calculations of the @xmath4 and @xmath0 fluxes ( i.e. planckian versus stellar or kurucz - type ) are of secondary importance , in contrast to what might be inferred from some reviews ( e.g. cannizzo 1993a , cannizzo 1998c ) .",
    "this is particularly true in comparing the @xmath4 and @xmath0 fluxes : in fact for the latter one may simply use @xmath24 @xmath1 the rate of mass loss from the inner disk onto the wd @xmath1 as a tracer of the @xmath0 flux . in this regard",
    "the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _",
    "satellite ( _ euve _ ) is an ideal instrument for studying accretion onto wds : the peak in its response function lies at @xmath25 a or @xmath26 kev , and the effective temperature in the disk @xmath27 , where @xmath28 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "evaluating gives @xmath29 ev @xmath30 g s@xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "the maximum temperature in the accretion disk ( evaluated at @xmath35r_{\\rm wd}$ ] ) is @xmath36 ev @xmath30 g s@xmath31 @xmath37 @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the peak in the accretion disk spectrum occurs at about a factor of ten lower in energy than the _ euve _ response peak .",
    "this region of the spectrum is largely masked by interstellar absorption .",
    "the flux seen by _ euve _ for dwarf novae in outburst must be predominantly coming from the boundary layer around the wd .",
    "we idealize this flux as representing the mass flux directly onto the wd from the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "the perception of a `` uv delay problem '' led many workers to consider scenarios for the quiescent evolution of dwarf novae in which the surface density is eroded at small radii via some type of low - level accretion onto the wd such that one creates a hole in the inner disk , thereby forcing the outbursts to be triggered at larger radii than would have otherwise happened ( e.g. livio & pringle 1992 , king 1997 , stehle & king 1999 , hameury , lasota , & dubus 1999 ) .",
    "although this specific impetus for such models is rendered invalid by smak s study , there may be other reasons to invoke some quiescent evaporation of the disk in dwarf novae , such as the observations of significant x - ray flux coming from the central star in quiescence , which can not be explained in the standard model ( e.g. mukai et al .",
    "1997 , van teeseling 1997 , pratt et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in this work",
    "we expand on smak s ( 1998 ) investigation by carrying out a detailed parameter study for three specific systems using a time dependent model for the development of the onset and subsequent evolution of the accretion disk following the start of a dwarf nova outburst .",
    "we use parameters appropriate for vw hyi , u gem , and ss cyg because for these dwarf novae there exist simultaneous @xmath4 and @xmath0 data during outburst ( mauche , mattei , & bateson 2001=mmb ) .",
    "the @xmath4 data in mmb were obtained by the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) and the variable star section / royal astronomical society of new zealand ( vss / rasnz ) ; their @xmath0 data comes from _ euve_.",
    "we perform a parameter study over @xmath38 @xmath1 the viscosity parameter characterizing the hot state of the disk , and @xmath39 @xmath1 the ratio of the triggering radius for thermal instability to the outer disk radius .",
    "we also examine the sensitivity of the results to the initial mass profile in the disk .",
    "specifically , we examine ( i ) the effect of putting all the initial mass into a torus at @xmath19 and leaving only a small surrounding background surface density @xmath40 , and ( ii ) the effect of varying @xmath41 which governs the quiescent disk mass .",
    "we utilize a new version of our standard time dependent disk instability code which was recently rewritten from fortran into c++ . the code has been tested to ensure numerical stability .",
    "the time dependent equations we solve are given in c93b .",
    "one combines the mass and angular momentum conservation equations into a diffusion equation for surface density , written under the assumptions of keplerian rotation @xmath42 and cylindrical symmetry .",
    "one similarly writes an energy equation under the assumption of cylindrical symmetry .",
    "together these two coupled nonlinear differential equations provide a means for calculating small changes in the surface density @xmath43 and midplane temperature @xmath44 for a given physical state of the disk specified by @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "if the disk is entirely on either the lower or upper stable branch of solutions ( i.e. , completely neutral gas or completely ionized gas ) , then only the diffusion equation for @xmath45 is solved in that time step . for such solutions",
    "we utilize power law scalings for @xmath47 given in c93b to determine the midplane temperature . for radii",
    "in which thermal transitions are occurring , we must also solve the energy equation , which contains both direct heating and cooling terms characterizing the departure from thermal equilibrium in a given annulus , as well as terms involving advection ( the physical transport of heat by the flow ) and terms representing the radial energy flux within the body of the disk .",
    "as in c93b , we interpolate @xmath48 logarithmically between @xmath41 and @xmath38 based on the local value of @xmath49 compared to @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the advective terms contain the local flow velocity @xmath52 @xmath53 which is calculated through ( upstream ) differencing at each grid point .",
    "two terms contribute to the radial flux of energy , a viscous term @xmath54 @xmath55 ( introduced by mineshige 1986 ) and a radiative term @xmath56 , where @xmath57 \\partial t/\\partial r $ ] ( introduced by faulkner et al .",
    "1983 ) . in c93b",
    "the radiative term @xmath58 was not utilized due to problems with numerical stability . in this work",
    "we have included this term , using the analytical scalings for the opacity @xmath59 given in lin & papaloizou ( 1985 ) . as we shall see later",
    ", @xmath60 in general , which is ironic given that the introduction of @xmath58 preceded that of @xmath61 .",
    "we take @xmath62 grid points equally spaced in @xmath63 between @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for the inner disk radius @xmath64",
    "we use the analytical white dwarf radius - mass scaling due to b. paczyski , as given by anderson ( 1988 , see his eqn .",
    "we specify an initial surface density profile so as to force the triggering for outburst at a given radius .",
    "this is accomplished by starting with a gaussian profile for @xmath66 centered at some @xmath67 which is either 0.5 , 0.7 , or 1.0 of the outer disk radius @xmath65 .",
    "we set the fwhm of the gaussian at @xmath68 and take @xmath69 .",
    "thus we idealize the @xmath70 state of the disk to consist of two components : a narrow torus representing material added from the secondary , and a broad component ( @xmath71 ) representing material left from the previous outburst . in view of the concerns raised by gammie & menou ( 1998 )",
    ", we consider the assumption of a constant and uniform @xmath41 to describe the quiescent evolution to be suspect and therefore do not run complete cycles as in smak ( 1998 ) .",
    "gammie & menou point out that the large resistivity of the neutral gas expected in quiescence may hamper the efficiency of the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , the currently favored mechanism for angular momentum transport in accretion disks ( balbus & hawley 1991 , hawley & balbus 1991 , for a review see balbus & hawley 1998 ) . unfortunately there is no quantitative way at the present time to carry out full time dependent calculations based on a physically self - consistent formalism which satisfies gammie & menou ( although menou 2000 represents a step in this direction ) .",
    "we must assume the existence of an @xmath41 ( @xmath72 ) so as to set the critical scalings associated with @xmath18 .",
    "we examine five values of @xmath38 : 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 , and 0.3 .",
    "we consider three specific systems and so adopt values of the central mass @xmath73 and outer disk radius @xmath65 relevant to each .",
    "the systemic values taken for vw hyi , u gem , and ss cyg models are @xmath74 @xmath75 cm ) @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "these values come from @xmath73 and @xmath79 values in ritter & kolb ( 1998 ) , where we take @xmath80 .",
    "therefore we carry out a total of 45 runs : 5 @xmath38 values @xmath81 3 @xmath39 values @xmath81 3 systemic parameter values . for each run",
    "we compute the absolute visual magnitude @xmath82 , the rate of mass flow within the inward moving heating front , and the local rate of mass flow at @xmath83 which we take to be the rate of accretion onto the wd .",
    "this is used as a tracer of the @xmath0 flux .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of our 45 trials .",
    "the three panels correspond to vw hyi , u gem , and ss cyg , respectively .",
    "the delay @xmath23 is measured between the onset of the rapid rise in @xmath4 and the increase in @xmath8 onto the wd .",
    "we define the onset of the rapid increase in @xmath4 flux by a small spike in @xmath4 which accompanies the end of the stagnation stage .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines in each panel show the observed delay between the rapid rises in @xmath4 ( from aavso and vss / rasnz observations ) and @xmath0 ( from _ euve _ observations ) taken from mmb .",
    "the delays are 0.75 d for vw hyi , 1.25 d for u gem , and 1.5 d for ss cyg .",
    "our computed delay does not scale exactly linearly with @xmath39 because the effective start of strong heating which follows stagnation comes after a period of slow growth of the thermally unstable annulus .",
    "thus after stagnation ends one is left with a hot annulus which is fairly broad , so that its inner edge lies somewhat interior to @xmath84 .",
    "this instant of time marks the onset of the rapid rise in @xmath4 and the launching of the heating front .",
    "figure 2 shows the duration of the stagnation intervals for the trials in fig .",
    "1 . these times are generally longer than the @xmath3 delay time intervals which immediately follow them .",
    "figure 3 shows the outburst onset for our `` best fit '' ss cyg model @xmath1 that for which @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "( our preference for @xmath87 comes from smak s [ 1999 ] investigation of the bailey relation [ bailey 1975 ] between outburst decay rate in @xmath4 and orbital period for dwarf nova outbursts . )",
    "one sees a long stagnation stage caused by the increased specific heat of gas at @xmath15 k. physically , the addition or subtraction of heat goes predominantly into changing the degree of partial ionization of the gas ; the resultant temperature change is minimal .",
    "there is a spike in @xmath4 at @xmath88 d accompanying the end of stagnation .",
    "the lower panel shows the local rate of mass flow associated with the inward moving heating front , on the same scale as the local rate of mass flow within the disk at @xmath89 .",
    "we calculate this by evaluating @xmath90 @xmath91 at the local maximum in @xmath66 which defines the heating front .",
    "this flow rate peaks at @xmath92 g s@xmath93 just after the onset of the front propagation .",
    "although this represents an enormous local rate of accretion , it may have negligible observational consequences due to the shallow gravitational potential at large radii .",
    "it is informative to plot @xmath94 and @xmath95 on the same scale , because one can see the direct causal relationship between the two ; the rapid rise in @xmath95 after the heating front reaches the inner edge is a direct consequence of the arrival of material carried within the heating spike at the wd .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath95 is determined by the mass carried in the heating front spike , and the subsequent slower rise to maximum over the next @xmath96 d is determined by the sloshing action of gas as the outburst density profile @xmath97 is established .",
    "figure 4 shows the speed of the heating front and @xmath98 values within the heating front for the model from fig .",
    "3 . the top panel shows the speed in units of @xmath99 , where all quantities are evaluated at the local maximum in @xmath7 within the heating front , and @xmath100 is taken to be either 0 , 1 , or 2 .",
    "the front speed closely follows @xmath101 or @xmath102 ( local hydrostatic equilibrium gives @xmath103 ) , confirming previous work by ( meyer 1984 ) and lin et al .",
    "( 1 ) of smak ( 1998 ) gives a scaling for the `` radial velocity of the accreting matter '' which would correspond to our @xmath104 case .",
    "we can exclude this expression as being the heating front speed .",
    "it is representative of the general viscous flow speed of gas within the parts of the disk that are far from the front , however ( see fig . 2 of cannizzo 1998b ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the front speed and corresponding values of @xmath98 within the front in the ss cyg models for which @xmath86 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath98 is virtually identical for all five curves , so that the heating front speed just scales linearly with @xmath48 .",
    "figure 6 shows the evolution of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the same model shown in the previous figures .",
    "each line is separated by 0.25 d. three distinct phases are evident .",
    "( i ) the first @xmath105 d of evolution encompasses a slow shift from the initial profile .",
    "the initial torus at @xmath106 cm smears and the temperature increases slowly .",
    "it is this period of evolution for which mineshige ( 1988 ) coined the term `` stagnation '' .",
    "stagnation is a direct consequence of the increase in the specific heat by a factor @xmath107 for gas at @xmath15 k ( see fig . 1 of c93b ) .",
    "( ii ) after stagnation has ended , a strong spike in @xmath66 develops at the inner edge of the annular heating region , and the spike moves to smaller radii .",
    "the amplitude of the spike decreases strongly with decreasing radius , approaching zero as @xmath108 .",
    "this stage lasts 1.5 d and is the direct cause of the @xmath3 delay ; this is the time required for the effect of strong heating ( i.e. , post - stagnation ) to be communicated to the inner edge of the disk .",
    "( iii ) now the entire disk has made the transition from neutral to ionized gas , but the flow pattern @xmath109 , although by now altered significantly from the quiescent profile , is still out of steady state . during the rest of the evolution the @xmath66 distribution changes in the sense that material at large radii shifts to smaller radii , asymptotically approaching @xmath97 and @xmath110 constant .",
    "figure 7 shows the evolution of the ratios of several terms in the energy equation to the heating term during stagnation .",
    "specifically , we follow @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the heating term @xmath115 , @xmath116 is the cooling term @xmath117 , and @xmath61 and @xmath58 are the viscous and radiative radial flux terms given earlier .",
    "one can see the increase with time of the annular extent of the thermally unstable ring .",
    "the heating exceeds cooling by a factor @xmath118 initially at the center of the annulus .",
    "the viscous term @xmath61 is comparable to @xmath116 , although @xmath112 is more nearly constant with radius . by comparing the second to third panels",
    "one sees the insignificance of the radiative term compared to the viscous term .",
    "the relative importance of these two terms has not been previously presented in a quantitative way , although some workers commented that @xmath58 is small ( e.g. ludwig & meyer 1998 ) . figure 8 shows the evolution of the terms in the thermal energy equation @xmath119 @xmath120 , where the direct heating and cooling term @xmath121 , the @xmath122 work term @xmath123 , and the advective term @xmath124 ( c93b ) .",
    "the @xmath122 term is less than term1 by about an order of magnitude , while the advective term is comparable to term1 in the interior of the stagnation annulus , and exceeds it slightly near the edges .",
    "the calculations of the previous subsection are based on simplifying assumptions , adopted for generality , that the initial mass distribution in the accretion disk at the time of triggering is a sum of two distributions @xmath1 a broad one @xmath125 representing matter left over from the previous outburst , and a narrow one @xmath126 comprising matter transferred from the secondary star which accumulates over some annular extent between the specific angular momentum radius and the outer disk edge . as discussed previously ,",
    "given the uncertainty about the physical processes which operate during quiescence and influence the @xmath66 evolution , our parameter study is intended to explore a broader range of triggering conditions than might be obtained in previous studies such as that of smak ( 1998 ) which follow the evolution of the accretion disk through several complete cycles under the assumption of some @xmath41 which is constant in space and time .",
    "we now look at the sensitivity of our results to the initial mass distribution .",
    "the @xmath3 delay essentially represents the time for the heating front to traverse the disk from @xmath19 to @xmath127 , therefore we need to understand how @xmath128 depends on the background @xmath66 profile . to explore this we now impose the additional constraint on our models that @xmath129 , where in separate runs we take @xmath130 to be either 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , 10 , or 100 g @xmath131 .",
    "we limit the maximum value of @xmath132 to @xmath133 .",
    "figure 9 shows the results for our ss cyg model in which @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the delays from our previous models .",
    "one can see that as @xmath136 , the time delays asymptote to a constant value equal to roughly twice that found earlier in the results for which @xmath137 . in our idealization of a background mass distribution plus a narrow torus",
    ", this limiting case corresponds to that in which all the disk mass is initially contained in the torus .",
    "one might have possibly expected the heating front to die out as @xmath136 ; we can definitely exclude this .",
    "the strong gradient in viscous stress within the expanding hot region is the primary agent which determines the properties of the heating front ; the background medium into which the hot material expands affects the expansion rate only to second order , given that the viscous stresses therein are much smaller .",
    "once @xmath40 drops below @xmath138 g @xmath131 , @xmath139 so that the background profile does not influence @xmath128 .",
    "figure 10 shows the evolution of @xmath128 for the runs accompanying figure 9 .",
    "the trials for @xmath140 0.01 , 0.1 , and 1 g @xmath131 are indistinguishable . for larger @xmath40 , the heating front speed @xmath141 increases because the greater disk mass supports a larger @xmath142 and therefore larger value of @xmath143 .    finally , we look at the effect of varying @xmath41 by a factor of 2 around our nominal value of 0.02 .",
    "the critical surface density @xmath18 scales as @xmath144 , therefore larger @xmath41 values translate into smaller accretion disk masses , which would lead one to predict smaller amplitude heating spikes traveling at slower speeds .",
    "figure 11 indeed shows that the delays are longer for larger @xmath41 , however the dependence is weak : a factor of 4 increase in @xmath41 only increases the front travel time @xmath23 @xmath145 by @xmath146 % .",
    "figure 12 shows the variation in the front speed @xmath128 .",
    "the maximum variation in @xmath141 occurs at @xmath147 cm in these models , ranging from @xmath148 km s@xmath93 to @xmath149 km s@xmath93 as @xmath41 varies from 0.01 to 0.04 .",
    "the variation at larger radii is less , which accounts for the relatively small range in @xmath23 as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "the most detailed and comprehensive study to date which investigates the structure and properties of transition fronts in accretion disks is that of menou , hameury , & stehle ( 1999=mhs ) . these authors utilize a fully implicit , adaptive mesh code ( hameury et al .",
    "1998 ) with 800 radial grid points .",
    "their dynamic allocation of grid points is optimized to place more grid points in regions with steep gradients .",
    "this offers a distinct advantage over a spatially fixed grid : their transition fronts generally contain @xmath150 grid points and hence are well resolved even at small radii .",
    "insofar as detailed comparisons can be made between our two studies , the results appear to be consistent .",

    "mhs also mention finding a weak inverse relation between @xmath157 and @xmath41 @xmath1 consistent with our results shown in figure 12 .",
    "our discussion of the relative importance of the different terms in the energy equation relates to the evolution of the disk during `` stagnation '' which precedes the outburst in @xmath4 .",
    "mhs discuss the physical effects and the relative importance of the different energy terms , and they show ratios of the terms to the heating term @xmath114 at one time during the propagation of a heating front after stagnation has ended ( see their figs . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "since these times are different , we can not directly compare our results to theirs .",
    "mhs show that , aside from a narrow precursor at the inner edge of the outside - in heating front , all terms except the cooling term @xmath116 are negligible .",
    "all plots in mhs showing the ratios of the different energy terms to @xmath114 are on a linear scale which allow one to see how @xmath114 is small compared to the other terms within the narrow precursor on the leading edge of the heating fronts , but prevent one from assessing the relative ordering of the energy terms within the main body of the front where the terms are of the order of or smaller than the heating term .",
    "we have examined the delay between the onset of visual and @xmath0 fluxes during a dwarf nova outburst , focusing on three systems for which complete @xmath4 and @xmath0 observations exist .",
    "we run 45 models spanning a range in systemic parameters , viscosity parameters , and triggering radii .",
    "when we combine our findings with those of smak ( 1999 ) , who prefers @xmath87 based on the normalization for the bailey relation , we infer that the triggering radii must be close to outer edge of the disk , at @xmath158 of the primary s roche radius .",
    "this seems consistent with the time dependent calculations of ichikawa & osaki ( 1992 ) and smak ( 1998 ) which include a provision for a variable outer disk radius , in which one sees a contraction of the outer disk in quiescence due to the accumulation of low angular momentum material from the secondary .",
    "we see a prolonged period of stagnation after the thermal instability is triggered , during which time there is only a very gradual increase in the disk temperatures and a slow spreading of the thermally unstable annulus . during stagnation one sees a weak maximum in @xmath7 at the inner edge of the annulus which propagates to smaller radii .",
    "the speed of this front is also @xmath102 ( where @xmath102 is evaluated at the peak of the spike ) , just as for the main heating front which begins later .",
    "it is slow due to @xmath159 and @xmath160 being small .",
    "stagnation lasts between @xmath138 d and @xmath161 d in our simulations .",
    "mineshige ( 1988 ) discusses several physical effects which contribute to stagnation .",
    "the only effect which appears not to be model dependent is that of the increased specific heat of gas at @xmath15 k due to the increased number of degrees of freedom of partially ionized gas .",
    "for instance , mineshige discusses a contribution to stagnation due to the steep @xmath162 dependence near the local maximum in @xmath7 in the equilibrium @xmath163 relation .",
    "this results in a near equality between the heating and cooling functions during the early stages of the thermal instability . in this work",
    "we utilize three simple power law scalings to describe the equilibrium @xmath163 relation so as to remain as model independent as possible ( c93b ) .",
    "complications in the vertical structure due to physics which is not well understood , such as convection in a strongly sheared medium ( gu et al .",
    "2000 ) , casts doubt on the trustworthiness of the detailed features of the equilibrium @xmath162 relation @xmath1 specifically the double hysteresis and intermediate stable branch of solutions which mineshige ( 1988 ) uses in his calculations .",
    "more generally , concerns raised by gammie & menou ( 1998 ) cast doubt on the standard assumption of having a well defined @xmath41 throughout quiescence . the lack of partial ionization may impede the operation of the mri which is thought to give rise to viscous dissipation and angular momentum transport in accretion disks . fleming et al .",
    "( 2000 ) calculate the nonlinear saturation level of the mri as a function of magnetic reynolds number @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the resistivity , for a variety of assumptions concerning the initial magnetic field geometry .",
    "they find that there is no universal constant to which @xmath48 saturates , but rather one finds a complicated , model dependent relation between @xmath166 and @xmath48 ( i.e. dependence on initial magnetic field configuration ) .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear how strongly dependent the @xmath167 values found by fleming et al are on their specific computational model .",
    "there may also be other physical effects that need to be considered in the 3d mhd calculations , such as hall currents associated with the weakly ionized quiescent state , where large resistivity is an issue ( balbus & terquem 2001 ) .",
    "if mhd modelers of the mri instability can reach a consensus on a general @xmath167 relation , that will serve as impetus for time dependent dwarf nova modelers to revisit their calculations .",
    "mineshige ( 1988 ) notes that the stagnation stage in his calculations lasts @xmath138 d and states that stagnation lengthens the @xmath3 delay more than in previous studies ( pvw , ck ) .",
    "mineshige suggests that the failure of the previous studies was tied to their over - simplified energy equation @xmath1 specifically , their adoption of a constant ( and small ) @xmath16 value .",
    "this view is not borne out by our calculations .",
    "we find an abrupt increase in @xmath4 by @xmath168 mag lasting a few hours once stagnation has ended .",
    "stagnation has no effect on the @xmath3 delay : it only influences the evolution prior to the start of the rapid rise in @xmath4 .",
    "( indeed , were we to add the stagnation intervals @xmath169 d to the heating front travel times @xmath170 d , we would obtain delays considerably longer than observed .",
    "mineshige might not have appreciated this since he only ran one model , for which the stagnation lasted @xmath138 d. ) there is a weak heating front associated with the spread of the warm region during stagnation , but the @xmath4 flux is low during this entire phase .",
    "after stagnation has ended a strong heating front forms and @xmath171 d later it reaches the wd .",
    "as noted by smak ( 1998 ) , the failure of earlier works was caused by their inability to produce outbursts which were triggered at sufficiently large radii . although our results seem to contradict those of mineshige ( 1988 ) by showing that stagnation has no effect on @xmath23 , it would probably be short - sighted on our part to assert that stagnation has no observational consequences .",
    "various groups have claimed to see subtle changes in dwarf novae just prior to optical outburst ( e.g. mansperger & kaitchuck 1990 ) .",
    "our simplified 1d treatment of the disk equations and energy flow , coupled with our simplistic methods for computing the disk fluxes , do not currently allow us to make a firm theoretical prediction about the observational consequences of stagnation .",
    "a contraction of the outer disk during quiescence due to the accumulation of low angular momentum material , followed by an augmentation in the surface density at large radii is one way to generate type a outbursts , but it is probably not the only way . even within the context of the formalism for the treatment of the outer boundary condition introduced by smak ( 1984 ) which was based on earlier work by papaloizou & pringle ( 1977 ) , there are some apparent inconsistencies . for instance , ichikawa & osaki ( 1994 ) present a comparative study using both linear and nonlinear treatments of the tidal torque at large radii in the disk .",
    "they conclude that the expression utilized by smak and later workers ( e.g. , ichikawa & osaki 1992 , hameury et al .",
    "1998 ) in which the tidal torque varies as the fifth power of radius does not adequately represent the abrupt nature of the tidal cut - off at large radii ( see figs . 3 and 4 of ichikawa & osaki 1994 ) .",
    "in addition , the strength of the tidal torque as characterized by its linear coefficient over - predicts the amplitude by about a factor of 20 that given by the full nonlinear calculation .",
    "another consideration as regards type a versus type b outbursts is the work by gammie & menou ( 1998 ) .",
    "they note that due to the low partial ionization of the disk gas in quiescence , the mri may be ineffectual , leading to a state of zero viscosity .",
    "this view is supported by menou ( 2000 ) , who finds runaway cooling during the transition to quiescence in a self - consistent model using @xmath167 values from fleming et al .",
    "if there were no other angular momentum transport mechanism operating in quiescence , the gas would pile up at some radius determined primarily by the specific angular momentum of the gas leaving the secondary star , and the triggering of the thermal instability might be the onset of some purely hydrodynamical instability within the accumulating torus .",
    "after interior temperatures rise to the point at which partial ionization is significant and the magnetic field entrained in the gas can couple effectively with the gas , the evolution would continue along the lines of what is presented in this paper .",
    "alternatively , menou ( 2000 ) suggests that some additional process such as spiral shocks may provide angular momentum transport and accretion during quiescence .    in accord with meyer ( 1984 ) and",
    "lin et al . ( 1985 ) , we find the heating front speed is given ( to within a factor of @xmath118 ) by @xmath172 , where the sound speed @xmath160 is evaluated within the heating front .",
    "this gives a delay time @xmath173 @xmath174 d @xmath175 , where the input values have been scaled to those of ss cyg , and we assume @xmath176 independent of radius . the `` start '' radius @xmath177 is the point at which the strong heating front develops following stagnation ; it is somewhat less than the `` instigation radius '' @xmath19 because of the slow spreading of the thermally unstable annulus during stagnation .",
    "this expression is general and should be applicable to other types of interacting binaries in which the accretion disk limit cycle operates @xmath1 for instance the low - mass x - ray binaries in which the accreting object is a neutron star or black hole .",
    "orosz et al .",
    "( 1997 ) see a delay of @xmath105 d between the rise in @xmath4 and soft x - ray flux during the onset of the 1996 april outburst in gro j1655 - 40 , a black hole candidate . using our scaling for the delay and taking @xmath178",
    "gives @xmath179 cm , which is a considerable fraction of the outer disk radius @xmath180 cm expected given the 2.6 d orbital period @xmath1 i.e , enough to generate a type a outburst .",
    "this would indicate that the standard model can explain the delay for this system ( see however hameury et al .",
    "1997 ) .    for generality",
    "we have adopted the point of view that , while there is good theoretical and observational evidence for having a well defined @xmath38 in the outburst state , the viscosity associated with quiescence is uncertain .",
    "this is unfortunate because the results presented herein show a significant dependence upon @xmath41 . if it does turn out to be the case that the viscosity in quiescence is non - local ( e.g. , proceeding via spiral shocks ) or vanishingly small , however , the whole disk instability model for dwarf novae would have to be completely revised",
    "this might then change completely the v - euv delay times .",
    "for definiteness we have had to work within the framework of the disk instability model since that is the only quantitative model which currently exists . for full consistency , were one to argue that the current quiescent models are wrong and then advocate an some alternative ( e.g. non - local angular momentum transport ) , one would then have to revise the entire limit cycle model based on the new assumptions .",
    "these comments also apply to the stagnation phase .",
    "our results show that the stagnation phase is not detectable in the overall light curve .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this may depend on the simplified model which everyone currently uses , but in any event the specific values of the stagnation times would be different in a drastically different model .",
    "finally , in this paper we have dealt only with outside - in outbursts .",
    "smak ( 1998 ) discusses and presents computations for inside - out outbursts as well .",
    "we have presented a time dependent parameter study of the onset of thermal instability for the accretion disks in dwarf novae , concentrating on parameters relevant for three well - studied systems , vw hyi , u gem , and ss cyg . for each system",
    "we look at the dependence of the delay between the initial rapid increase in @xmath4 and @xmath0 fluxes on triggering radii for the thermal instability within the disk , and the @xmath48 viscosity parameter for ionized gas .",
    "our basic conclusion is that , for @xmath87 which was inferred by smak ( 1999 ) based on the bailey relation for the decay of dwarf nova outbursts , we find that triggering must occur at large radii @xmath181 of the wd s roche radius to produce delays that are as observed .",
    "we find that the speed of the inward moving heating front which communicates the effect of the thermal instability is @xmath102 ( evaluated within the heating front spike ) , in agreement with previous estimates .",
    "we also see a prolonged period ( @xmath169 d ) of slow heating ( stagnation ) following the onset of thermal instability ( mineshige 1988 ) .",
    "in contrast to mineshige , we find that stagnation has no effect on the @xmath3 delay since it precedes the rapid rise in @xmath4 . in exploring the sensitivity of our results to the initial mass distribution",
    ", we find that as the background surface density is made smaller ( i.e. , all the mass is put into the torus at @xmath19 initially ) , the delay @xmath23 increases by about a factor of two above that given by calculations in which the background surface density @xmath182 initially is intermediate between the critical surface densities @xmath183 and @xmath18 .",
    "for an upper limit background surface density @xmath184 g @xmath131 , the value of @xmath23 is independent of @xmath40 . if there were a significant amount of evaporation of the inner disk during quiescence for instance which depleted the @xmath66 values interior to @xmath19 without changing @xmath19 , that could increase @xmath23 by up to a factor @xmath185 above that found in studies such as that of smak ( 1998 ) .",
    "a logical next step would be to include some evaporation at a rate consistent with quiescent x - ray observations of dwarf novae into the time dependent calculations of the limit cycle , in order to quantify the effect of the depleted @xmath66 distribution in the inner disk .",
    "it seems unlikely that a self - consistent inclusion of this effect would change @xmath23 by as much as a factor of 2 , given that the @xmath38 values of @xmath186 inferred by smak ( 1999 ) through independently fitting both the observed @xmath23 values and rates of decay from outburst are in agreement .",
    "finally , we find a weak inverse dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath41 .",
    "this comes about because larger @xmath41 values lead to smaller accretion disk masses ( via the dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath41 ) , so that the heating front spike has a smaller amplitude and lower speed .",
