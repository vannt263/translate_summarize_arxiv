    "the setup of the system under consideration is similar to those recently investigated with spherical @xcite and planar @xcite substrates . within the framework of the primitive model we consider a pe solution near a charged hard rod with an implicit solvent ( water ) of relative dielectric permittivity @xmath0 .",

    "therefore @xmath53 can measure the _ screening _",
    "strength of the cylindrical macroion - charge by the neighboring solute charged species .",
    "in this part , we study the adsorption of pc chains ( system @xmath60 ) for the two couplings @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the case @xmath61 , corresponding to a purely electrostatic regime , is well understood for `` normal spherical '' electrolyte ions near a charged rod .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the situation is much more delicate for pe adsorption , and that has not been the subject of numerical simulations.@xcite this is a decisive step to elucidate the even more complex pe multilayer structures where additionally pas are also present .    here , where @xmath63 ( i.e. , no polyanions ) , global electroneutrality is ensured by the presence of explicit pc s counterions ( i.e. , monovalent anions ) and the macroion - rod s counterions ( i.e. , monovalent cations ) .",
    "the profiles of the monomer density @xmath64 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.nr_monolayer ] .",
    "near contact ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) , the density @xmath64 at @xmath62 is about one order of magnitude larger than at @xmath61 . to further estimate the degree of adsorption of pc monomers we have plotted the fraction @xmath66 of adsorbed monomers in fig .",
    "[ fig.nr_monolayer ] . at a radial distance @xmath67 ( corresponding to a width of two monomers ) , almost all the the monomers ( more than 99% )",
    "are adsorbed for @xmath62 against only @xmath68 for @xmath61 .",
    "this strong observed pc adsorption at @xmath61 is of course due to the high valence of the polycation ( here @xmath69 ) and the intense attractive electric field near the _ thin _ rod . on the other hand , at high enough @xmath70 and ( even ) _ without _ rod - monomer electrostatic interaction [ i.e. , for a neutral rod ( @xmath71 ) ] , the pc adsorption would be very similar to that obtained at finite @xmath72 .",
    "the ( global ) net fluid charge @xmath53 is reported in fig . [ fig.qr_monolayer ] . in all cases",
    "we detect a macroion - surface charge reversal ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) . the position @xmath74 at which @xmath75 gets its maximal value decreases with @xmath70 , due to the @xmath70-enhanced adsorption of the pcs .",
    "concomitantly , this _ overcharging _ increases with @xmath70 , since the ( extra ) gain in energy by macroion - monomer vdw interactions can better overcome ( the higher @xmath70 ) the cost of the self - energy stemming from the adsorbed excess charge . @xcite more quantitatively , we have @xmath76 at @xmath62 against @xmath77 at @xmath61 .",
    "note that the maximal value of charge reversal of @xmath78 ( i.e. , @xmath79 ) allowed by the total charge of pcs can not be exactly reached due to a slight accumulation of microanions .",
    "however at @xmath62 , the presence of microanions near the rod is very marginal , leading in practice to an overcharging that is fully governed by the pcs .",
    "again this giant overcharging found at any @xmath70 is due to the high ( intrinsic ) electric field generated by the macroion rod .",
    "indeed , for the same chain parameter , it was found in planar geometry ( with a surface charge density @xmath80 ) that only a charge reversal of about 70% [ i. e. , @xmath81 could be reached at @xmath62.@xcite for cylindrical substrates , it turns out that the equivalent surface charge density [ here @xmath82 can be much higher in experimental conditions . those ( locally ) overcharged states should be the driving force for the building of subsequent pe bilayers when pa chains are added .",
    "typical equilibrium configurations can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.snap_monolayer ] . the qualitative difference between @xmath61 [ fig .",
    "[ fig.snap_monolayer](a ) ] and @xmath62 [ fig .",
    "[ fig.snap_monolayer](b ) ] is remarkable . without additional vdw attraction ( @xmath61 )",
    "the adsorption is more diffuse than at @xmath62 , where in the latter situation the @xmath50-fluctuation is very weak .",
    "interestingly , one can observe that the pc chains tend to adopt a helical structure .",
    "this kind of conformation is the non - trivial result of two antagonistic forces : ( i ) electrostatic correlations and ( ii ) entropy . to clarify this point ,",
    "one has to consider two typical length scales :    * if the cylindrical macroion is larger or about the pe chain ( i.e. , @xmath83 as it is presently the case ) , then the ground state @xcite corresponds to _ straight _ pe chains sticked to the surface of the rod . at _",
    "finite _ temperature one obtains pc chains spiraling around as the result of the _ coupled effects _ of entropy and electrostatic correlations . * if @xmath84 , then the ground state ( already ) corresponds to perfectly ordered helical structures ( so as to overscreen the rod ) which locally resemble a one - dimensional wigner crystal .",
    "@xcite at finite temperature and strong coulomb coupling ( as it is the case with highly charged pes and macroion - substrates ) , this high helical ordering persists at shorter range .",
    "those reasonings above should at least hold when the equivalent surface charge densities of the pe and that of the rod are similar , as it is the case in this study .",
    "we now consider the systems @xmath85 where additionally pa chains are present , so that we have a ( globally ) neutral polyelectrolyte complex ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) .",
    "global electroneutrality is ensured by the counterions of the cylindrical macroion as usual .",
    "we stress the fact that this process is fully reversible for the parameters under investigation .",
    "in particular , we checked that the same final _ equilibrium _",
    "configuration is obtained either by ( i ) starting from system with isolated pcs and then adding pas or ( ii ) starting directly with the oppositely charged pes .",
    "the profiles of the monomer density @xmath87 at @xmath61 and @xmath62 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.nr_bilayer](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.nr_bilayer](b ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding microstructures are sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig.snap_bilayer ] .      at @xmath61 , a comparison between systems @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.nr_monolayer ] ) and @xmath88 indicates that the adsorption of pc monomers is weaker when additional pas are present . this effect was already observed with spherical @xcite and planar @xcite substrates , and the same mechanisms apply here to cylindrical substrates .",
    "more explicitly , the pc tends to build up a globular state ( reminiscent of the classical _ bulk _ pe collapse ) by getting complexed to the pa chain , as perfectly illustrated in fig . [ fig.snap_bilayer](a ) .",
    "thereby , the mean number of nearest monomer - neighbors gets higher which is _ both _",
    "( i ) entropically and ( ii ) energetically ( at least from the pe complex viewpoint ) favorable .",
    "it turns out that for macroion - rods with large curvature , this pc desorption is counter - intuitively much higher than in the planar case , @xcite although a much weaker charge reversal ( without pas ) was found for the latter .",
    "indeed , we just saw that the overcharging by pcs alone can be quite huge ( of the order of 200 % even at @xmath61 - see fig .",
    "[ fig.qr_monolayer ] ) , and thus , one would naively expect a new wave of charge reversal in system @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 ) of the same order ( see also sec .",
    "[ sec.charge ] for a more quantitative description ) which in turn should lead to a ( very ) stable bilayering .",
    "but figs . [ fig.nr_bilayer](a ) and [ fig.snap_bilayer](a ) demonstrate that it is not the case .",
    "furthermore , an inspection of the density profile @xmath90 of the pa monomers reveals that there is _ no _ peak for @xmath91 .",
    "those interesting findings allow us to already draw a partial conclusion :    * at large enough rod - curvature and small enough pe concentration , even if a giant overcharging would occur in the absence of pas , it is not sufficient to promote bilayering .",
    "hence , this spectacular pa - induced pc desorption is due to entropic effects .",
    "more precisely , the adsorption onto quasi one - dimensional objects is extremely costly from an entropy viewpoint , and if the number of available dipoles ( i.e. , pc - pa ion pairs ) is too small then ion - dipole correlations are not strong enough to overcome the  entropic barrier `` . upon increasing @xmath92 ( i.e. , the pe concentration )",
    "one sees that the density @xmath64 at contact increases [ also identifiable on figs .",
    "[ fig.snap_bilayer](a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) ] and gets gradually less sensitive to @xmath92 , showing that a ' ' steady \" regime should be reached at large enough @xmath92 . concomitantly , by increasing @xmath92 ,",
    "[ fig.nr_bilayer](a ) shows that the adsorption of pa monomers increases [ also identifiable on figs .",
    "[ fig.snap_bilayer](a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) ] .",
    "this @xmath92-enhanced adsorption of monomers is essentially governed by two concomitant mechanisms :    * at higher @xmath92 , the global ion - dipole correlation gets enhanced ( due to an increase of pc - pa ion pair concentration ) which favors a stronger monomer adsorption .",
    "* concomitantly , at higher @xmath92 , where the available volume becomes lower , the _ entropy loss _ undergone upon adsorption gets reduced , which also favors a stronger monomer adsorption .",
    "nevertheless , only a very broadened peak in @xmath90 ( at @xmath93 ) is seen and _ no second _ peak in @xmath64 appears , indicating a weakly stable bilayer .",
    "this feature strongly contrasts with our previous findings for planar substrates @xcite where _ stable _ trilayers were reported at @xmath61 ( also with @xmath69 ) .",
    "therefore , we can state :    * pe multilayering in the electrostatic regime is highly inhibited at large rod - curvature , mainly due to entropic effects . it is to say that the ( conformational ) pe entropy along the rod is much smaller than that in the bulk and also smaller than that on a planar surface .      in general all our mechanisms previously described at @xmath61",
    "are also present here at @xmath62 , but one has now to take into account the possible dominance of the vdw interaction near the surface of the cylindrical macroion .    at @xmath62 , fig .",
    "[ fig.nr_bilayer](b ) shows that the first pc layer is always very stable ( despite of the presence of pas ) due to the the sufficiently strong rod - pc vdw attraction . in parallel , @xmath64 and in general the ordering increase with @xmath92 , as it should be . at large @xmath93",
    ", one can detect a second broadened peak in @xmath64 which could be the signature of the onset of a third pe layer .",
    "however , the height of this peak is still significantly smaller than the corresponding decaying pa density @xmath90 in this region . a visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig.snap_bilayer](b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) confirms all those features .",
    "hence , even with the help of a specific vdw attractive interaction , it seems that the formation of stable structures beyond bilayers is highly inhibited at strong confinement .",
    "this again proves how important is the role of entropy in pe multilayering with low dimensional substrates .      the net fluid charge @xmath53 is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig.qr_bilayer ] . in all cases ,",
    "the cylindrical macroion gets ( locally ) overcharged .",
    "surprisingly , beyond the pc overcharging layer the fluid charge does not reenter below unity ( at least for @xmath94 ) , proving that there are no charge _",
    "oscillations _ in the vicinity of the rigid rod . even with an overcharging of @xmath95 for @xmath62 and @xmath93 , no charge oscillation is generated .",
    "this is , nevertheless , consistent with our previous results of fig .",
    "[ fig.nr_bilayer ] where no multilayering was observed .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the fact that our pe concentration is still ( very ) small even at @xmath93 , which is also the experimental situation in the process of pe multilayering where a _ rinsing _ is applied at each successive layer deposition @xcite .",
    "it is well known that at _ high finite _ electrolyte concentration , charge oscillations take place near a charged cylindrical wall . @xcite",
    "our results clearly show that the degree of overcharging is systematically larger at high @xmath62 , as also observed without pas ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.qr_monolayer ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath96 are also systematically shifted to smaller ones as one increases @xmath70 .",
    "however , the position of the peak ( @xmath97 ) for @xmath62 remains nearly independent of @xmath92 in contrast to what happened at @xmath61 , where @xmath96 is systematically shifted to smaller radial distances upon increasing @xmath92 .",
    "all those observations are consistent with our mechanisms presented so far .    nonetheless , as soon as _",
    "oppositely charged polyions _ can interact , there is a subtle interplay between clustering and the lateral correlations of polyions that governs the degree of overcharging near the macroion surface , as it was already demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite . additionally , at strong rod curvature ,",
    "entropic effects become also considerable .",
    "consequently , the physics of overcharging involved in the adsorption of oppositely charged pes onto one - dimensional substrates is highly complicated .",
    "in summary , we have carried out mc simulations to elucidate the adsorption of flexible highly charged polycations and polyanions onto a charged cylindrical substrate . within the dilute regime , we considered the influence of pe concentration . in order to enhance the possible formation of pe multilayers we have also considered an extra non - electrostatic short - range attraction ( characterized here by @xmath70 ) between the cylindrical macroion surface and the polycations .    as far as the pc adsorption is concerned ( in the absence of pas ) , we demonstrated that huge macroion charge reversal occurs even in a purely electrostatic regime with @xmath61 . by adding exactly the same amount of pas",
    ", we surprisingly observe a ( relatively ) marginal overcharging which is due to ( i ) pc - pa clustering and ( ii ) above all to _ entropic _ effects .    at higher number of pes ,",
    "our results show that true bilayering ( i.e. ; flat and dense pe layers ) can only occur at finite @xmath70 , in contrast to what was recently found with planar substrates . @xcite",
    "even at finite @xmath70 , our simulation data demonstrate that stable multilayering ( beyond bilayering ) is hard to reach at large macroion rod - curvature , due to the _ high entropy loss _ there .",
    "this latter in turn inhibits the appearance of charge _",
    "oscillations_. however , there must be a certain regime of curvature , typically when the rod radius is larger or about the chain size ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) , where such entropy effects become less relevant and would then lead to similar behaviors to those occurring with planar substrates . in this respect ,",
    "a future work could include the effect of rod - curvature on the formation of pe multilayers .",
    "we hope that this contribution will trigger new theoretical as well as experimental investigations .",
    "the author thanks c. n. likos and h. lwen for helpful discussions and a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "only the monomer - monomer excluded volume interaction was not modeled by a hard - sphere potential .",
    "there , a purely repulsive truncated and shifted lennard - jones potential was used [ see eq .",
    "] so as to be compatible with the fene potential employed to generate the chain connectivity .",
    "note that in principle , the real _ macroscopic _ vdw interaction between an infinitely long cylinder and a point particle scales like @xmath99 .",
    "nevertheless , to get a stronger decaying potential we took a power of 6 ( i.e. , @xmath100 ) .",
    "please , note that even a square well potential would also be fully acceptable for the purpose of this study , but the drawback lies in its discontinuity .",
    "note that recently , the adsorption of flexible polycations onto a long _ fully flexible _",
