    "the _ cobe _ dmr experiment has now been completed ( @xcite ) , and the four - year sky maps that were produced are the last word on large - angle cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies that we are likely to have for some time .",
    "the impact of these data on models of structure formation has been immense . by providing a theoretically clean measure of the mass fluctuations in the linear regime , the _ cobe _ data has allowed for the first time a @xmath0 determination of the amplitude of the power spectrum of cosmological models .",
    "this normalization supersedes the previous best method of normalization based on the abundance of clusters ; alternatively , the two normalizations together constrain one extra combination of cosmological parameters .",
    "the combination of cluster abundances and the _ cobe _ normalization on large - scales has definitively ruled out the `` standard '' cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with adiabatic , scale - invariant initial fluctuations . for more discussion on the impact of the _ cobe _ data on large - scale structure theories , see ( @xcite ) .",
    "the _ cobe _ data determine the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum at large scales with a statistical error of @xmath1 . in order to fully exploit this high - precision determination one must go beyond the simple sachs - wolfe ( @xcite ) approximation to the large - angle anisotropy spectrum and a simple summary of the _ cobe _ data such as the rms fluctuation or the correlation function . in this paper",
    "we present normalizations of several popular cdm based models of structure formation by performing a maximum - likelihood fit of numerically computed anisotropy spectra directly to the _ cobe _ pixel data .",
    "tests using monte - carlo data sets indicate that our maximum - likelihood estimates are unbiased and that the maximum - likelihood points provide `` good '' fits to the data .",
    "we quote our results for both the radiation and matter power spectra at large scales , which in any _ particular _ model have a definite relationship .",
    "we also discuss how one computes the normalization on smaller scales from our results .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : likelihood ] we discuss the method used to perform the maximum - likelihood fits to the _ cobe _ data , which is based on the karhunen - love ( kl ) transform . in this section",
    "we also present results of our monte - carlo simulations to test for bias in the fitting method . in ",
    "[ sec : freq ] we present two different frequentist methods for using the _ cobe _ data to constrain models , and we contrast these methods with the bayesian analysis used in the rest of the paper . the normalization of the radiation power spectra for models in the cdm family is considered in  [ sec : radiation ] , where we also provide fitting functions for a class of models with approximately quadratic anisotropy spectra . for open ( ocdm ) and cosmological constant ( @xmath2cdm ) cold",
    "dark matter models we give likelihood functions vs.  @xmath3 from the _ cobe _ data . in ",
    "[ sec : matter ] we use the results of  [ sec : radiation ] to find the amplitude of the matter power spectrum for a wide range of cdm models .",
    "after describing some implications of the _ cobe _ normalization for models of large - scale structure in  [ sec : lss ] , we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the normalizations and likelihoods presented in this paper are based on an analysis of the four - year _ cobe _ dmr sky maps ( @xcite ) . as discussed in ( @xcite ) there is much more information in the _ cobe _ dmr data than simply the rms fluctuation , so detailed fitting of a theory to the pixel data is necessary to obtain all of the information available from this data set .",
    "we analyze the data by performing a karhunen - love ( kl ) transform , _",
    "i.e. _ , expanding the data in a set of modes that optimally retain signal and throw away noise .",
    "this method is also known as the signal - to - noise eigenmode analysis , or optimal subspace filtering . for further information on this method , see ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us start by describing the likelihood analysis of the _ cobe _ dmr pixel data .",
    "as usual , we expand the cmb temperature anisotropy @xmath4 in spherical harmonics : @xmath5 the _ cobe _ data have been shown to be consistent with gaussian fluctuations ( @xcite ) such as are predicted by the simplest inflationary theories and by most defect theories ( on large scales ) .",
    "we will only consider gaussian theories in this paper , hence each @xmath6 will be an independent gaussian random variable of zero mean .",
    "thus all of the cosmological information in the cmb is contained in the variances @xmath7 the quantities @xmath8 are collectively referred to as the angular power spectrum .",
    "our goal in analyzing the dmr data is to test hypotheses about the angular power spectrum .",
    "we work with a single dmr sky map consisting of a weighted average of the two 53 ghz maps and the two 90 ghz maps , in the ecliptic pixelization .",
    "we weight the maps according to the inverse of the noise variance in each pixel , in order to have minimal noise in the resulting map . under the assumption of gaussian statistics ,",
    "this is mathematically equivalent to performing a multi - map likelihood analysis .",
    "( we do not use the 31 ghz maps for fear of galactic contamination ; in any case , the noise levels in these maps are high enough that little information is lost by not using them . ) we remove all pixels that lie within the `` custom cut '' described in ( @xcite ) , leaving @xmath9 pixels . in addition , we remove a best - fit monopole and dipole .",
    "this last step is formally unnecessary , since our likelihood analysis is explicitly forced to be insensitive to the monopole and dipole .",
    "let @xmath10 be the temperature measurement corresponding to the @xmath11th pixel , and let @xmath12 be the @xmath13-dimensional vector @xmath14 .",
    "( throughout this paper , we will denote vectors in real three - dimensional space by boldface type , and vectors in other spaces such as `` pixel space '' by arrows . )",
    "the datum @xmath10 contains contributions from both signal and noise : @xmath15 here @xmath16 represents the window function of the experiment ( @xcite ) , the star denotes convolution , @xmath17 is the location on the sky of the @xmath11th pixel and @xmath18 is a random variable representing the noise .",
    "the dmr noise is approximately gaussian , and noise correlations from pixel to pixel are weak ( @xcite ) .",
    "the noise covariance matrix @xmath19 is therefore approximately diagonal .    since the underlying ,",
    "theoretically uncorrelated variables are specified in @xmath20 space we wish to write @xmath21 in terms of the @xmath6 . for notational convenience",
    "we will denote a pair of indices @xmath22 by a single greek index such as @xmath23 .",
    "the correspondence between the two is @xmath24 so that @xmath23 ranges from 1 to @xmath25 as @xmath20 and @xmath26 vary over their entire allowed ranges .",
    "we introduce an @xmath27 matrix @xmath28 whose elements are @xmath29 . the most natural way to represent the window function is by a diagonal matrix @xmath30 , where @xmath20 is the index corresponding to @xmath23 and @xmath31 is the legendre polynomial expansion of the window function",
    ". then we can write @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the vectors whose components are @xmath35 and @xmath18 respectively .    the covariance matrix , @xmath36 , of @xmath37 is diagonal , and its nonzero elements are those of the angular power spectrum @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath20 is the index corresponding to @xmath23 as before . we know the covariance matrices of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and we assume that the signal and noise are uncorrelated : @xmath40",
    ". we can therefore write down the covariance matrix of the data vector @xmath12 : @xmath41 the matrix @xmath42 is the beam - smoothed angular power spectrum , and recall @xmath43 .",
    "since we are assuming that both the signal and noise are gaussian , we know the entire probability distribution function of the data vector @xmath12 : @xmath44    we will regard @xmath45 as a function of @xmath46 rather than as a function of the data @xmath12 : after all , @xmath12 is fixed and @xmath46 is unknown . in this context , @xmath45 is called the _ likelihood _ and is denoted @xmath47 .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimate of some set of parameters @xmath48 ( which may of course be a set containing only one element ) , is that for which @xmath49 is maximized .",
    "the bayesian credible region , assuming a uniform prior for the parameters , is a volume @xmath50 bounded by a surface of constant @xmath51 such that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the confidence level associated with the region , and the integral on the right - hand side extends over all of @xmath48 space .",
    "note that this procedure is completely general , and in no way depends upon the assumption of gaussian statistics . of course",
    ", if we do not make the assumption of gaussianity , then eq .  ( [ eqn : likely1 ] ) is not valid , and we need to replace it with something else .",
    "these prescriptions tell us how to perform our parameter estimates .",
    "unfortunately , we have no guarantee that these estimates will be unbiased . in the case of gaussian statistics ,",
    "parameter estimates are asymptotically unbiased ; however , since we deal with finite sample sizes , this guarantee does not apply .",
    "if we are concerned about bias , we therefore have no recourse but to perform monte carlo simulations to test for it , as we discuss in  [ sec : tests ] .",
    "the full likelihood function is awkward to compute , since it involves inverting an @xmath54 matrix .",
    "this has been done for a small family of models using the two - year dmr data ( @xcite ) , but if we want to look at a larger family of models , we need to find a way to `` compress '' the data before computing the likelihood .",
    "this is the purpose of the kl transform .",
    "the idea is to ( linearly ) project the data vector onto a subspace of smaller dimension , and compute likelihoods based on the projected data vector .",
    "we attempt to choose the subspace in such a way that the likelihood function based on the new `` compressed '' data vector contains almost all of the useful information in the original likelihood function .    to be specific ,",
    "suppose that our goal is to estimate the normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "then the optimal @xmath55-dimensional subspace to choose turns out to be that spanned by the @xmath55 solutions @xmath56 with the largest eigenvalues of the following eigenvalue equation : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the signal part of the covariance matrix ( @xcite ) .",
    "we should warn the reader that there are two definitions of the eigenvalues in popular use .",
    "for one choice the eigenvalues are in units of signal - to - noise and range from 0 to infinity .",
    "the other , used in this paper , has the eigenvalues in the range 0 to 1 .",
    "the two are related by the mapping @xmath59 with @xmath60 as above .    of course",
    ", we do nt know @xmath61 _ a priori _ , since we do nt know the power spectrum .",
    "( if we did , there would be no need to do a likelihood analysis ! ) .",
    "we must therefore choose a `` fiducial '' power spectrum @xmath38 in order to compute the eigenmodes .",
    "we use a flat power spectrum @xmath62constant as our fiducial power spectrum for the entire likelihood analysis , although as we will describe below we have performed tests to show that our results do not depend significantly on this choice .",
    "the signal - to - noise eigenvalues are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigvals ] , where it can be seen that the first @xmath63 contain significant signal .",
    "the accuracy with which we can measure power spectrum normalizations is determined by the sharpness of the peak of the likelihood function , that is , by the quantity @xmath64 , where @xmath65 represents the normalization and the derivatives are evaluated at the peak of the likelihood function .",
    "this quantity is proportional to @xmath66 , which is therefore the relevant figure of merit to describe our ability to reject incorrect models .",
    "this quantity is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigvals ] .",
    "contour plots of a sample of eigenvectors in aitoff projection are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigvecs ] .",
    "the multipoles probed by these eigenvectors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigells ] .",
    "many of the eigenmodes show a surprising lack of symmetry between the upper and lower hemispheres ; mode 400 , for example , shows much more structure in the upper hemisphere than in the lower . in every such case",
    ", there is a nearly degenerate eigenmode that is a approximately a reflection of the given mode .",
    "for example , mode 399 looks very much like mode 400 , but with most of its structure concentrated in the lower hemisphere .",
    "once we have chosen our subspace , we can project the data vector down onto this subspace and compute likelihoods in terms of the projected vector .",
    "however , before we can use these likelihoods we need to take proper account of the monopole and dipole .",
    "when we remove a best - fit monopole and dipole from the data , we are inadvertently removing some contribution from the other modes , since incomplete sky coverage breaks the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics . from a bayesian point of view , the natural way to correct for this is to marginalize over the monopole and dipole .",
    "that is , we should replace @xmath51 by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the monopole and @xmath69 are the three dipole components .",
    "all four of these quantities are unknown , so we marginalize over them by letting them range over all possible values and integrating .",
    "fortunately , the variation of @xmath51 with these four quantities has a simple gaussian form , and so the integral can be done analytically .",
    "this procedure turns out to be mathematically equivalent to forcing the eigenmodes to be orthogonal to the monopole and dipole , _",
    "e.g. _ , by gram - schmidt orthogonalization , as is done by grski et al .",
    "( 1996a ) .    in previous analyses of the dmr data ,",
    "the quadrupole has frequently been excluded along with the monopole and dipole .",
    "although we will give a few quadrupole - excluded results below , most of our results will include the information contained in the quadrupole .",
    "ever since the initial detection of anisotropy in the one - year cobe maps , it has been known that the cobe quadrupole moment is lower than one would expect from `` preferred '' cosmological models ( _ i.e. _ , those with roughly scale - invariant power spectra ) normalized to the modes with @xmath70 .",
    "since we know _ a priori _ that the cobe quadrupole is anomalous ( compared to our theoretical expectations ) , we should be quite hesitant to throw it away : in throwing away data that is known _ a priori _ to be discordant , we run the risk of biased data editing . in the absence of compelling evidence of quadrupolar contamination , we therefore regard it as more prudent to retain the quadrupole .",
    "there are many ways to estimate the quadrupole from the dmr data , and in general they are not equivalent .",
    "( in the absence of complete sky coverage , there is no way to estimate a particular multipole without contamination from other multipoles . )",
    "if we estimate the five components of the quadrupole by simply integrating over the observed part of the sky , @xmath71 and estimate the quadrupole by computing @xmath72 and subtracting off noise bias , we find that @xmath73 for the four - year dmr data . using the same estimator",
    ", we find quadrupoles of @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the one - year and two - year data sets .",
    "to decide whether this quantity is inconsistent with a particular model , we need to compare it with simulations .",
    "we find that @xmath76 is low enough to be inconsistent with a flat harrison - zeldovich power spectrum at about the @xmath77 confidence level .",
    "one should be reluctant to rule out any models on this basis , however : we knew _ a priori _ that the quadrupole was low , and confidence levels based on a subset of data that is known _ a priori _ to be discordant can be misleading .      to define our subspace we truncate the eigenmode expansion at @xmath78 vectors , as we find that increasing the number of modes makes little difference to the results .",
    "for example , the estimate of the quadrupole normalization @xmath79 for a flat sachs - wolfe @xmath80 spectrum is @xmath81 using 500 modes vectors the typical time to evaluate the likelihood function at one point is @xmath82 seconds on a sparc-10 . ] .",
    "if we increase the number of modes to 700 , we find @xmath83 . increasing the number of modes also fails to increase significantly our sensitivity to the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "for example , using 500 modes our determination of the spectral index @xmath84 ( for a pure sachs - wolfe spectrum ) is @xmath85 ; using 700 modes this result becomes @xmath86 .",
    "removing the quadrupole information from the fit ( by marginalizing over the quadrupole as well as the monopole and dipole ) increased the normalization to @xmath87 for @xmath80 , and changes the best - fit value of @xmath84 from 1.2 to 1.0 .    in order to assess the sensitivity of our results to the choice of fiducial power spectrum , we computed some likelihoods using an @xmath88 sachs - wolfe power spectrum ( as opposed to the flat @xmath80 spectrum ) as our fiducial power spectrum .",
    "the results are virtually identical . for example , the maximum - likelihood estimate of @xmath89 for a flat @xmath80 power spectrum , computed with an @xmath88 fiducial power spectrum , is @xmath90k .",
    "furthermore , the maximum - likelihood point in the @xmath91 plane is @xmath92 for either a flat or an @xmath88 fiducial power spectrum .",
    "as mentioned before , we have no _ a priori _ guarantee that our maximum - likelihood parameter estimates will be unbiased .",
    "we have therefore performed monte carlo simulations to test for bias .",
    "we generated 564 simulated sky maps with a pure @xmath80 sachs - wolfe power spectrum and a normalization of @xmath93 , and we determined the maximum - likelihood normalization for each .",
    "the average estimated normalization was @xmath94 , with a standard deviation of @xmath95 .",
    "note that this standard deviation is a frequentist estimate of the error in our estimate of the normalization , which can be compared with the bayesian error estimate of @xmath96 given above .    in the above test , the input power spectrum was the same as the fiducial power spectrum .",
    "since this might not be a fair test , we also performed simulations with an @xmath88 sachs - wolfe power spectrum and a scale - invariant `` standard cdm '' spectrum . for the @xmath88 spectrum ,",
    "the input normalization was @xmath97k , and the average estimated normalization was @xmath98k with a standard deviation of @xmath99k . in the simulations of a standard cdm spectrum , we used an input normalization of @xmath100k ; in this case , the mean estimated normalization was @xmath101k with a standard deviation of @xmath102k .",
    "based on these results , we are confident that there is no significant bias in our normalization estimates .",
    "we also tested for bias in our estimate of the slope @xmath84 of the power spectrum .",
    "we made simulated maps with sachs - wolfe input spectra with parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 as before , and found the maximum - likelihood point in the @xmath91 plane for each .",
    "we found that the average estimate of @xmath84 in the two cases was @xmath105 and @xmath106 , with standard deviations of @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "= 3.5 in    our results for pure sachs - wolfe spectra agree well with those of ( @xcite ) , though an exact comparison is not possible since we use a combination of the maps which excludes the 31ghz map and weights the 53ghz and 90ghz maps differently .",
    "furthermore , the kl transform and the orthogonalized spherical harmonic technique of grski et al .",
    "give give slightly different weights to the various spherical harmonic modes .",
    "we therefore would not expect perfect quantitative agreement between our results even if we used identical maps .",
    "we would of course expect any discrepancies to be well within the errors , though , and in fact we find that this is the case .",
    "grski et al .  (",
    "1996 ) quote a maximum likelihood point of @xmath109k ) and a best fitting scale - invariant normalization of @xmath110k if they include the quadrupole and use the `` coadded '' ecliptic maps with the custom cut ( the closest to our procedure ) .",
    "our maximum likelihood point is @xmath111k ) and our best fitting scale - invariant normalization @xmath110k .",
    "the difference in likelihood between @xmath112k ) and @xmath113k ) in our calculation is only 3% , so this agreement is very good . for the quadrupole _ excluded _ results , ( @xcite ) find the most likely point is @xmath114k ) while we find @xmath115k ) . again",
    "the best fitting point of ( @xcite ) is only slightly less likely than our maximum likelihood point and _ well _ within our @xmath116 error ellipse .    the best - fitting @xmath38 spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : bestfit ] .",
    "to determine this spectrum , we let all @xmath38 s for @xmath117 vary independently until the likelihood was maximized .",
    "a flat power spectrum with @xmath118 is shown for comparison .",
    "the error bars shown in this figure are standard errors determined by approximating the likelihood near the peak as a gaussian .",
    "the standard errors are then the square roots of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of this gaussian .",
    "error bars determined in this way should be viewed with extreme caution .",
    "first , the likelihood is not very well approximated by a gaussian : on the contrary , it is strongly skew - positive at low @xmath20 .",
    "second , these standard errors contain no information about correlations between the errors .",
    "these correlations are largest for pairs of modes whose @xmath20-values differ by 2 .",
    "coupling between modes with @xmath119 are weak because the data has approximate reflection symmetry .",
    "the normalized correlation coefficient @xmath120 is typically @xmath121 at low @xmath20 for @xmath122 and decreases to @xmath123 for larger @xmath20 .",
    "the correlations are typically @xmath123 for @xmath124 over the whole range in @xmath20 .",
    "the deceptively small error bar on the estimate of @xmath125 is largely due to the failure of the gaussian approximation for the likelihood , although the 15% anticorrelation between @xmath125 and @xmath126 also plays a role .",
    "the kl expansion is essentially a technique for optimally retaining signal and throwing away noise in a data set .",
    "as one might expect , it is closely related to similar methods , such as the wiener filter ( @xcite ) . assuming that the statistical properties of the signal and noise are known , applying the wiener filter to a map preferentially removes noise and leaves signal .",
    "it is the optimal linear filter which can be constructed for this purpose .",
    "wiener filtering is particularly easy to perform in the kl basis .",
    "specifically , the amplitude of the @xmath127th eigenmode of the wiener - filtered sky map is obtained simply by multiplying the amplitude of the same mode of the raw map by the eigenvalue @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : klmaps ] we show the result of wiener - filtering the dmr data in this way , as well as a map obtained by simply truncating the kl expansion after 400 modes .",
    "the limits and error bars we have quoted so far in this paper have been based upon bayesian rather than frequentist techniques .",
    "this has become standard practice in cmb data analysis , largely because bayesian results are often easier to compute than frequentist ones . for a bayesian ,",
    "the likelihood function is all that is needed , whereas to find the boundaries of a frequentist confidence interval one also needs to know the theoretical probability distribution of some goodness - of - fit statistic .",
    "these probability distributions can often only be computed by time - consuming monte carlo simulations .    although there is nothing intrinsically wrong with bayesian methods , there are certain circumstances in which a frequentist approach is to be preferred .",
    "first , bayesian estimates may sometimes depend too strongly on the assumed prior , making interpretation of the results controversial . as a rule ,",
    "this is a serious problem only when the parameter being estimated is weakly constrained by the data ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "second , although bayesian techniques supply relative probabilities of different models , they are in general unable to determine the intrinsic goodness of fit of a single model . as we saw above , we are able to find the most probable values of parameters like the normalization @xmath89 and the spectral index @xmath84 ; however , bayesian methods are unable to tell us whether or not the _ best _ fit is actually a _ good _ fit .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider ways of applying frequentist techniques to the _ cobe _ data .",
    "( we have in fact mentioned some frequentist error estimates above , when we discussed the monte carlo simulations we performed to test for bias in our maximum - likelihood parameter estimates . )",
    "we begin by reminding the reader of the general approach a frequentist takes to hypothesis testing .",
    "frequentist statistical analyses are always based on some _ goodness - of fit statistic _ @xmath128 .",
    "the statistic should be chosen in such a way that it takes on low values when the data fit the model well and large values when the fit is poor . for a particular hypothesis",
    ", we compute the probability distribution of @xmath128 , and we say that the hypothesis is ruled out with significance @xmath129 if @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the value found in the actual data .",
    "for such an analysis to have high power , it is obviously essential to choose @xmath128 wisely .",
    "one common choice of goodness - of - fit statistic is the _ likelihood ratio_. to illustrate this choice , let us consider a family of spatially flat , cdm models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath2cdm ) and @xmath80 .",
    "these models are characterized on _ cobe _",
    "scales by only two parameters , the normalization @xmath89 and the density @xmath132 .",
    "if we wish to test the hypothesis that @xmath3 takes on some specific value @xmath133 , we choose as a goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath134 if @xmath3 is far from @xmath133 , then we expect this ratio to be large . in order to decide whether a particular value of @xmath133 is allowed by the data ,",
    "we compute the probability distribution of @xmath128 by making many simulated _ cobe _ sky maps with a power spectrum corresponding to @xmath135 and computing the likelihood ratio ( [ eq : likerat ] ) for each one . this time - consuming process must be repeated for each value of @xmath133 we are interested in .    upon performing this procedure for @xmath136 , we find that the likelihood ratio is 3.16 .",
    "only 10% of simulated maps give a larger value , and we therefore conclude that this particular model is ruled out with a significance of 10% ( or at 90% confidence ) . by way of comparison",
    ", we shall see below that a bayesian analysis of the same family of models says that a 95% credible lower limit on @xmath3 is 0.13 .",
    "note that this family of models is an example of a situation where the bayesian limit will have significant prior dependence , since as fig .",
    "[ fig : like_om ] shows , the likelihood is large over a significant fraction of the allowed parameter space .",
    "a frequentist limit is therefore quite useful .",
    "unfortunately , frequentist limits based on likelihood ratios are extremely expensive to compute , since the probability distribution of @xmath128 must be recomputed by monte carlo simulation for each point in parameter space .",
    "the use of likelihood ratios to set frequentist limits alleviates only one of the two disadvantages of the bayesian approach : we have `` removed '' the prior dependence , but the likelihood ratio still gives no information about intrinsic goodness of fit : even if the data are an intrinsically poor fit to the whole family of models , there will still be a value of @xmath133 for which the likelihood will peak and @xmath128 will take on its lowest possible value . in ( @xcite )",
    "we proposed a different goodness - of - fit statistic to resolve this problem , and we will now describe a slight variant of this statistic .",
    "let @xmath137 be the vector of amplitudes in our eigenmode expansion .",
    "for a particular theoretical model , we can compute the theoretical covariance matrix @xmath138 , and then transform to a new basis : @xmath139 any convenient square root of the covariance matrix may be chosen ; we recommend cholesky decomposition .",
    "the advantage of changing basis in this way is that the predicted covariance matrix of @xmath140 is the identity matrix . that is , each @xmath141 is predicted to be an independent unit gaussian random variable .",
    "we shall see that this can save us a great deal of effort .",
    "next , we sort the @xmath142 from largest to smallest angular scale probed ( by computing the mean value of @xmath20 in a spherical harmonic expansion ) and sum @xmath143 over bins of some size @xmath144 : @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the total number of modes . if our theoretical model is correct , then each @xmath148 should be @xmath149-distributed and should therefore have expectation value @xmath144 .",
    "if our model is incorrect , then the dispersion of @xmath148 about this expectation value should be larger .",
    "we therefore propose as a goodness - of - fit statistic the variance , @xmath150 the prefactor @xmath151 is arbitrary ; we chose it so that the expectation value of @xmath128 is one when the model is correct .",
    "one great advantage of this statistic is that its probability distribution is model - independent : @xmath128 is simply the average of @xmath152 independent @xmath149-distributed random variables . we need to compute this probability distribution only once .",
    "furthermore , unlike the likelihood ratio , this statistic is in principle capable of testing the possibility that the whole family of models under consideration are poor fits to the data .",
    "the statistic ( [ eq : eta ] ) has two parameters : the number of modes @xmath147 and the bin size @xmath144 .",
    "we experimented extensively with simulated data sets to find the values of those statistics that maximized the power to reject incorrect models .",
    "we made simulated sky maps with a flat @xmath153 power spectrum and tried to find values of the parameters that maximized our ability to reject an @xmath154 model .",
    "we found that the greatest power was achieved when the number of bins was fairly small ; we chose @xmath155 and @xmath156 , so that the number of bins is only five .",
    "unfortunately , the power of this statistic proves to be quite low : we are typically able to reject the low-@xmath3 model with significances of only @xmath157 . as we have seen , the likelihood ratio allows significantly greater power , rejecting the same model at a significance of @xmath158 .",
    "it is in general difficult to tell _ a priori _ whether a particular goodness - of - fit statistic will be a powerful discriminator among a given class of models ; the statistic @xmath128 does not perform as well in this regard as one might have hoped .",
    "although this statistic has low power , it is perhaps nonetheless worth quoting some results based on it , since it is capable of supplying intrinsic goodness - of - fit values for individual models ( a task for which the likelihood - ratio is ill - suited ) .",
    "we find that , for the harrison - zeldovich @xmath2cdm models we have been considering in this section , the significance ranges from 29% when @xmath153 to 17% when @xmath154 , with higher significances denoting better fits .",
    "the fact that all of these significance levels are acceptable is somewhat reassuring : in principle we could have discovered that the whole class of models fit the data at an unacceptably poor level , in which case estimating parameters by means of likelihood ratios or bayesian methods would be a suspect procedure .",
    "we now turn to the problem of quoting the best - fitting amplitude for various models .",
    "we break this into two parts : determining the best - fitting amplitude of the _ radiation _ power spectrum and the best - fitting amplitude of the _ matter _ power spectrum .",
    "we discuss the first problem in this section .",
    "since the ratio of the radiation to the matter power spectrum is an output of the model under consideration , the second follows from the first and will be considered in  [ sec : matter ] .    the inadequacy of using only the rms fluctuation in the map to determine the amplitude of a given model from has been discussed by ( @xcite ) . as an example , normalizing a scale - invariant sachs - wolfe spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : swcl ] ) to the rms anisotropy smoothed to @xmath159 , @xmath160k , one would obtain @xmath161 .",
    "this is 30% ( @xmath162 ) lower than obtained from a fit to the full data set .",
    "however , while the data clearly can not be summarized by one number , keeping the information from each and every pixel is redundant for the theories we are considering . since fitting theories directly to the data is quite time consuming , in what follows we will quote results which allow a simple but accurate method for normalizing a given radiation spectrum to the full _ cobe _ data .    for most models of structure formation the angular power spectrum at low",
    "@xmath20 contains little structure .",
    "if we could simply parameterize the shapes of the spectra of interest , we could pre - compute and tabulate the normalizations from the _ cobe _ data .",
    "which types of spectra should we investigate ? as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : sw ] and [ fig : cl_omega ] , the radiation power spectrum for a cold dark matter model is not that of a pure sachs - wolfe spectrum of gravitational potential perturbations ( @xcite ) : @xmath163 for standard cdm the effect of including the full @xmath38 spectrum ( that is adding the integrated sachs - wolfe and velocity contributions ) is to reduce the best - fitting normalization by @xmath164 at @xmath125 , which gives an indication of the curvature of the spectrum . including a full numerical calculation of the radiation spectrum also introduces dependences on the cosmological parameters .",
    "all except for @xmath3 and @xmath84 are small , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : matter ] .",
    "we follow ( @xcite ) in parameterizing the radiation power spectrum in terms of quadratics .",
    "specifically , if we write @xmath165 then we provide the normalization for quadratic @xmath166 using the methods outlined in  [ sec : likelihood ] .",
    "to normalize a theory then , one computes the radiation power spectrum for that theory , finds the closest quadratic approximation to it over the range relevant to _ cobe _ ( roughly @xmath167 to @xmath168 ) and reads off the normalization which we provide for that quadratic .",
    "this works quite well for a large range of theories .",
    "for example , for open and @xmath2cdm models with @xmath169 and @xmath170 we find at most a 1% difference between normalizing to a quadratic approximation between @xmath171 and @xmath172 with points weighted equally in @xmath173 . ] and normalizing to the full theory , as shown in table  [ tab : fiterrors ] .",
    "we choose to parameterize the shape of the spectrum by the ( normalized ) first and second derivatives at @xmath174 , specifically @xmath175 and @xmath176 where @xmath177 note that @xmath175 and @xmath176 are @xmath178 times the first and second derivatives of @xmath166 at @xmath174 .",
    "the overall normalization is @xmath179 .",
    "below we quote the normalization as @xmath180 or @xmath181 , for each @xmath182 pair , and the goodness of fit by the relative likelihood of that shape compared to a featureless , @xmath80 , sachs - wolfe spectrum : @xmath183 .    in terms of this parameterization",
    "we find that the following fitting function @xmath184 describes the likelihood function with an error of 6% in l over the range @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the peak likelihood is at @xmath187 , which is outside the range of the fitting function , and the likelihood at peak is 8.9 times that for a flat spectrum .",
    "the likelihood is plotted as a function of @xmath175 and @xmath176 in fig .",
    "[ fig : quadlikely ] .",
    "similarly , the best - fitting value of @xmath181 is well approximated by @xmath188 with an error of 1% over the same range .",
    "the @xmath116 statistical uncertainty in @xmath181 is 13.8% .",
    "uncertainties in rms quantities are therefore 7% .",
    "several popular theories ( e.g.  open and @xmath2cdm models ) have radiation power spectra which are not well fit by quadratics all the way down to the quadrupole ( e.g.  figs .",
    "[ fig : sw ] , [ fig : cl_omega ] ) .",
    "this is especially true if a tensor component is added since the @xmath167 mode is high in the tensor spectrum . while the best - fitting normalization is not too sensitive to the assumption of a quadratic over the entire range , this is not true of the likelihood .",
    "we quantify in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] and in table  [ tab : fiterrors ] what error in the likelihood function and the normalization arise from approximating several spectra by quadratics .",
    "the quadratic approximation causes errors of consistently less than 1% in the normalization @xmath181 ; these errors are completely negligible in comparison with statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the errors in the likelihood are somewhat larger , but still not enough to significantly affect our conclusions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in principle , _ cobe _ lets us constrain models of large - scale structure in two independent ways : we can use both the shape of the power spectrum and the normalization . in practice , though , the shape constraints turn out to be quite weak for most popular models , as we saw in  [ sec : radiation ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : like_om ] .",
    "we therefore focus on the implications of the power spectrum normalization .",
    "table  [ table ] gives values of the small - scale density fluctuation amplitude @xmath189 for a selection of models .",
    "the first line makes it clear that _",
    "cobe_-normalized `` standard '' cdm ( @xmath80 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 ) predicts significantly too much small - scale power and is therefore ruled out .",
    "however , any of several slight changes to the model can easily resolve this inconsistency .",
    "perhaps the simplest solution is a slight tilt to the power spectrum .",
    "inflationary models typically predict spectral indices slightly less than one , and a value of @xmath84 of 0.8 or even less is quite natural in such models .",
    "we have discussed the difference in normalization between the open and @xmath2cdm models in the previous section . by reducing the density",
    "we reduce the small - scale fluctuation amplitude as measured , say , by @xmath189 .",
    "since @xmath189 is typically too large in `` standard '' critical - density cdm models , such low - density models tend to fare better .",
    "as we saw above , the suppression of @xmath189 is greater in open models than in @xmath2cdm models .",
    "these results are quantified for some specific models in table  [ table ] .",
    "another obvious impact of the _ cobe _ normalization is that it differentiates between the classes of theories based on adiabatic fluctuations ( e.g.  inflation ) and those based on isocurvature fluctuations ( e.g.  topological defect models ) . in the adiabatic models , the fluctuations in all the constituents have the same sign , so an overdensity of photons is also",
    "an overdensity of baryons and cold dark matter .",
    "this means that photons from overdense regions ( which are hotter than average , @xmath192 ) must climb out of larger than average potential wells , in the process losing energy . in isocurvature models it is `` cold '' photons which must climb out of such potential wells .",
    "thus , in the adiabatic case the `` intrinsic '' temperature fluctuation and the gravitational redshifting effect partially cancel , while in the isocurvature case they add .",
    "this leads to smaller temperature fluctuations for a given matter fluctuation in the adiabatic case , or conversely larger matter fluctuations when normalized to the temperature fluctuations observed by _",
    "the relative normalization of the matter and temperature fluctuations in any particular model depends upon the details of that model , but the above argument is general enough that we may expect it to hold in a large class of models . since the adiabatic models predict roughly the right amount of power when compared to large - scale structure measurements on smaller scales , the generic isocurvature models predict too little .",
    "these issues are dealt with in more detail in @xcite and references therein .",
    "discussion of particular models of structure formation is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "analyses based on the four - year _ cobe _ data have been performed for critical - density models ( @xcite ) , @xmath2cdm models ( @xcite ) , and open cdm models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main difference between the four - year results and those based on analyses of the two - year data ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and references therein . )",
    "is a reduction of @xmath164 across the board in the _ cobe _ normalizations .",
    "part of this reduction is due to galactic contamination in the two - year analyses : the two - year data were typically analyzed with a straight @xmath193 galactic cut , as opposed to the slightly more extensive `` custom cut '' ( @xcite ) that has been applied to the four - year data .",
    "the four - year _ cobe _ dmr sky maps provide some of the most stringent constraints on cosmological models . because the data are so powerful , and because they are the best large - angle cmb data we are likely to have for the next few years , it is important to extract as much information as possible from them . in particular , when using _ cobe _ to normalize models for large - scale structure formation , one should perform a full fit to the data , rather than using a single number such as the root - mean - square temperature fluctuation smoothed on some angular scale .",
    "we have provided normalizations and likelihoods based on the four - year dmr data for a broad class of cosmological models . in conjunction with small - scale measurements of the matter power spectrum such as @xmath189 ,",
    "these _ cobe _ normalizations allow us to place significant constraints on the parameters of various cosmological models .",
    "furthermore , cmb data on smaller angular scales is improving rapidly in both quality and quantity . by comparing these data with the estimates of the _ cobe _ power spectrum",
    ", it will soon be possible to severely constrain models on the basis of the cmb angular power spectrum alone .",
