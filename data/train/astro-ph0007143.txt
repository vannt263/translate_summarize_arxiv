    "recently , @xcite proposed carbon nanoparticles as the material responsible for extended red emission ( ere ) .",
    "ere is a broad ( @xmath3 ) emission band with a peak wavelength between 0.65 and 0.88  @xmath0 seen in many dusty astrophysical objects as well as the diffuse interstellar medium ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a review of the observed characteristics of ere can be found in @xcite . among other proposed carriers for ere",
    "are hydrogenated amorphous carbon @xcite , coal @xcite , quenched carbonaceous composite @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , and silicon nanoparticles @xcite . identifying",
    "the material responsible for ere is important as @xcite have shown that this material must be a major component of dust grains .",
    "they found that the ere in the diffuse interstellar medium on a galaxy - wide scale emits 4% of the energy absorbed by dust at wavelengths below 0.55  @xmath0 .",
    "if ere could be convincingly identified with carbon nanoparticles , this could have implications on the carriers of the 2175    extinction bump and 3.4  @xmath0 ch@xmath5 absorption feature as both have also been attributed to carbon nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the photoluminescence spectrum expected for different sized carbon nanoparticles .",
    "the carbon nanoparticles in their model are composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen atoms with @xmath6 bonds ( i.e. , aromatic bonds ) . in general",
    ", the term carbon nanoparticles refers to materials which a mixture of @xmath6 and @xmath7 bonds ( i.e. , aromatic and aliphatic bonds ) .",
    "@xcite specifically chose to model only @xmath6 carbon nanoparticles to match the observed high photoluminescence efficiency of ere in the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "the @xcite model predicts an ere spectrum with three peaks at 0.5 , 0.7 , and 1.0  @xmath0 .",
    "the 0.7  @xmath0 peak is the peak usually identified with ere .",
    "the 0.5  @xmath0 peak has never been seen and this fact is accounted for by @xcite . in their model , the 0.5  @xmath0 peak is produced by the smallest carbon particles .",
    "they point out that the environments where good ere spectra exist are those with harsh uv radiation fields which will destroy all carbon nanoparticles with less than 50 carbon atoms .",
    "this effectively removes the 0.5  @xmath0 peak from the emission spectrum of ere .",
    "there is an observed ere spectrum of a high latitude cirrus cloud where the 0.5  @xmath0 sideband might be expected , but it is not of sufficient signal - to - noise to detect the 0.5  @xmath0 peak @xcite .",
    "the search for the predicted 1.0  @xmath0 band was the motivation for this work .",
    "previous to this paper , no published 1.0  @xmath0 spectra existed of a dusty object showing the familiar 0.7  @xmath0 ere feature .    in order to test the prediction of a 1.0  @xmath0 feature associated with ere emitting dust , we have taken 0.35 to 2.5  @xmath0 spectra of two filaments in ngc 7023 .",
    "ngc 7023 is the well known reflection nebula illuminated by the herbig be star hd 200775 @xcite .",
    "the two filaments we observed are well known photodissociation regions which have been studied extensively at many wavelengths ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these filaments are the tips of fingers of molecular material , as seen in co , which point towards hd 200775 @xcite .",
    "the filaments have been observed to emit ere @xcite , many @xmath8 emission lines @xcite , continuum emission from transitionally heated small dust particles @xcite , and the aromatic infrared features @xcite .",
    "the two filaments are composed of molecular cloud material which is being uncovered and modified by the uv - strong spectrum of hd 200775 .",
    "this results in a rich spectrum of dust and gas emission features .",
    "in addition to the dust and molecular emission features listed above , the filaments are also known emitters of atomic hydrogen , carbon , and oxygen @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the emission from atomic silicon ( 34.8  @xmath0 ) apears strongly enhanced between the filaments and the illuminating star @xcite .",
    "this implies that there is a transition from the solid to the gas phase of silicon at the filament edge .",
    "long  slit optical spectra of ngc  7023 were obtained at kpno with the goldcam spectrometer on the 2.1 m telescope on 27 june 1998 in photometric conditions .",
    "observations were carried out using grating # 201 with a slit width of 3@xmath9 , resulting in a spectral range of @xmath10  with a resolution of @xmath11    ( fwhm ) as measured from night sky lines .",
    "two five second exposures of hd 200775 were obtained along with three 900 second exposures of ngc 7023 ; both sets of observations were obtained at an airmass of @xmath12 . for the observations of ngc 7023",
    ", the 5@xmath13 long slit was positioned @xmath14 west of hd 200775 at a position angle of @xmath15 .",
    "standard reduction steps were performed using iraf , and the details of the reduction are given in @xcite .",
    "the hd 200775 spectra were extracted from a @xmath16 wide region centered on the star .",
    "the sky emission was subtracted using sky spectra determined from positions above and below the star .",
    "nebular spectra were extracted for the northwest and south filaments and their sky subtraction was done using sky spectra measured near the ends of the slit .",
    "the positions , aperture sizes , and position angles of the northwest and south filament spectra used in this paper are given in table  [ tab_pos ] .",
    "the optical spectra are designated nw - opt and s - opt for the northwest and south filaments , respectively .",
    "the other entries are for the new near - infrared spectra presented in this paper ( nw - nir and s - nir ) and previously published near - infrared spectra @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_pos ] shows the positions of all the filament spectra on a wfpc2/f606w image constructed from hst archival observations @xcite .",
    "our near - infrared spectrophotometry of the ngc 7023 filaments and its illuminating star hd 200775 were acquired with the 3-m shane reflector of lick observatory . the northwest and south filaments ( nw - nir and s - nir in table  [ tab_pos ] ) were observed on 30 august 1999 ( ut ) and hd 200775 was observed on both 28 and 30 august 1999 ( ut ) .",
    "the instrument used was the near infrared imaging spectrograph ( niris ) .",
    "a detailed description of the instrument , which is a two - channel , long slit spectrograph operating from 0.8 to 2.5 @xmath0 , is given by @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph has a beam splitter at 1.4 @xmath0 which feeds two arrays , allowing for simultaneous observations below and above 1.4 @xmath0 .",
    "the arrays do not cover the entire spectral range in one setting , but each requires 3 settings to cover ( with overlaps ) the entire 0.8 to 2.5 @xmath0 range .",
    "the resolution of the spectra is 18 and 36    for wavelengths shorter and longer than 1.4  @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "for the observations of the south filament , the brightest portion of the filament was centered visually in one half of the east / west oriented slit .",
    "for the northwest filament , the brightest portion of the filament was centered visually in one half of a northwest / southeast ( position angle @xmath17 ) oriented slit . to facilitate removal of the telluric background emission",
    ", spectra were acquired with the filament positioned in one half ( position 1 ) and then the other half ( position 2 ) of the slit . at each spectral",
    "setting , four spectra , with exposure times of 25.5 seconds , were taken in the pattern of position 1 , 2 , 2 , and 1 .",
    "the total exposure time for the filament spectra were 102 seconds .",
    "the dimensions of the slit were @xmath18 . the data from a @xmath19 swath along the slit at each of the two positions were combined to produce the filament spectrum .",
    "for the observations of hd 200775 , a @xmath14 telescope `` nod '' was used to separate the two observing positions .",
    "the individual exposure times for hd 200775 were 0.5 seconds , and 20 exposures were taken at each spectral setting .",
    "the final spectrum of hd 200775 is a combination of the data taken on 28 and 30 august 1999 .",
    "the comparison star used to remove the instrumental response and the effects of atmospheric absorption , and to determine the absolute flux level for both the filaments and their illuminating star on 30 august 1999 was hr 7967 , a g8iii star .",
    "the visual magnitude of @xmath20 from of the bright star catalog @xcite and the @xmath21 color for a g8 giant @xcite , implies a k magnitude of 4.25 .",
    "the intrinsic spectral shape of hr 7967 was removed from this ratio by using the model for this spectral type from @xcite .",
    "on 28 august 1999 , the comparison star was 16 cyg b ( hr 7504 ) , a g3v star .",
    "the positions , aperture sizes , and position angles of these near - infrared filament spectra are given in table  [ tab_pos ] and plotted in figure  [ fig_pos ] .",
    "the combined 0.352.5  @xmath0 spectrum of hd 200775 , the illuminating star of ngc 7023 , is plotted in figure  [ fig_star ] .",
    "in addition , optical and near - infrared photometry for hd 200775 are plotted @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum was multiplied by 1.05 to make it match the optical photometry and the overlap region with the near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "this adjustment could be due to the uncertainties in the absolute calibration of the optical spectroscopy or the known variation in the flux levels for hd 200775 @xcite , a herbig be star . the good agreement between the optical and near - ir spectra in the overlap region ( fig .",
    "[ fig_star ] , inset plot ) in both continuum shape and line features increases our confidence in both observations .",
    "our new near - infrared spectra of the south and northwest filaments are plotted along with those from the literature @xcite in figure  [ fig_comp_neb ] . as the literature observations were taken with different apertures and on similar , but different , locations in each filament ( see table  [ tab_pos ] and fig .  [ fig_pos ] ) , we have scaled their observations to match the overall level of our new h band observations . for the south filament ( fig .",
    "[ fig_comp_neb]a ) , both spectra ( s - nir & s - nir(m97 ) ) are very similar in the h band , but show different k band continuum levels . for the northwest filament ( fig .",
    "[ fig_comp_neb]b ) , the h band continuum is very similar between nw - nir and nw - nir(m97 ) , but both spectra have a much different continuum shape than that of nw - nir(m99-h2 ) .",
    "the k band spectra for all three northwest filament spectra are similar in continuum shape with nw - nir(m97 ) having a slightly higher overall level .",
    "the differences between spectra are not surprising as the spectra from different sources were taken with different apertures on different positions in each filament .    as we have identified the origin of the northwest filament h band continuum shape with a new dust emission feature ( see @xmath22[sec_newf ] )",
    ", it is important to point out that the h band continuum shape is very unlikely to be the result of an error in the way the data were taken or reduced .",
    "if there was such an error , it would be very unlikely that the h band spectral shapes of both the south and northwest filaments would agree between our spectra ( s - nir & nw - nir ) and those of @xcite ( s - nir(m97 ) & nw - nir(m97 ) ) as each was taken by a different instrument on a different telescope by different observers and reduced by different people .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the spectral shape of the northwest h band spectra is real .",
    "with the new spectra presented in this paper , we can study the dust scattering and emission in ngc 7023 between 0.35 to 2.5 @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to characterize the dust scattering and emission in the optical and near - infrared and test the prediction of @xcite .",
    "the 0.35 to 2.5 @xmath0 spectra of both filaments are plotted in figure  [ fig_neb ] .",
    "both filament spectra have been divided by the spectrum of hd 200775 , leaving ratio spectra whose shape is only dependent on the dust scattering , dust emission , and gas emission .",
    "the gas emission gives rise the [ ] and @xmath8 emission lines , the analysis of which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the dust scattering and emission mainly affects the continuum shape of these ratio spectra while the gas emission is responsible for most of the emission lines .      in fig .",
    "[ fig_neb ] , the theoretical ratio spectra for different dust scattering situations have been plotted in addition to the filament ratio spectra .",
    "the theoretical spectra have been computed using a model presented in @xcite .",
    "the model equations can be used to compute the ratio spectra for single angle dust scattering .",
    "this is the situation for the two filaments of ngc 7023 which are discrete density enhancements in the reflection nebula @xcite .",
    "the theoretical ratio spectra were computed using average milky way dust grain properties ( albedo , scattering phase function asymmetry , and extinction curve ) @xcite .",
    "the cases plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_neb ] are for infinite optical depth ( @xmath23 inf ) , very optically thin ( @xmath24 ) , and a best estimate case ( @xmath25 for ( a ) and @xmath26 for ( b ) ) .",
    "we assumed the optical depths from the star and the filament to the observer were equal .",
    "all the theoretical curves were normalized to the observed value at 0.45  @xmath0 .",
    "the scattering angles which gave reasonable fits to the data were 90@xmath27 and 60@xmath27 for the south ( fig .",
    "[ fig_neb]a ) and northwest ( fig .",
    "[ fig_neb]b ) filaments , respectively .",
    "it was only possible to get _ reasonable _ fits to the data as the continuum in the near - infrared is due to both dust scattered stellar light and emission from transitionally heated small dust particles @xcite . as a result , the fraction of the ratio spectrum due to dust scattering in the near - infrared is decreasing as the wavelength increases .",
    "the emission from transitionally heated small dust particles starts in the j band and increases rapidly to the k band .",
    "@xcite predicted that ere is due to photoluminescence from @xmath6 coordinated carbon nanoparticles .",
    "for the conditions present in ngc 7023 , they predicted that ere produces 0.7 and 1.0  @xmath0 emission bands ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . both the observed filaments exhibit strong ere bands near 0.7  @xmath0 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_neb ] and previous work @xcite .",
    "neither filament shows a 1.0  @xmath0 feature as predicted by @xcite for carbon nanoparticles .",
    "the northwest filament does show tentative evidence for a feature peaking at 1.15 @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_feature_id ] and  [ sec_newf ] ) , but this feature peaks at a significantly longer wavelength than predicted by @xcite and so is unlikely to be due to carbon nanoparticles .",
    "the central wavelength of the 1.0  @xmath0 peak predicted by @xcite varies very little ( @xmath28  @xmath0 ) for a large range of carbon particle sizes ( @xmath29 ) and dispersions around each size ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the lack of any feature at 1.0  @xmath0 in both filaments calls into question the identification of carbon nanoparticles as modeled by @xcite as the carrier of ere .",
    "we do note that @xcite do predict a weak 1.0  @xmath0 peak for a small subset ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) of the size distributions of carbon nanoparticles they modeled ( see their figs .  2 & 4 ) and state in their conclusions that there are mixtures with larger carbon nanoparticles which exhibit the main ere peak around 0.8  @xmath0 and no 1.0  @xmath0 peak .",
    "but this does not correspond to the conditions in the ngc  7023 filaments which have their main ere peaks near 0.7  @xmath0 .    while the lack of the 1.0  @xmath0 peak in our observations does not rule out carbon nanoparticles as the source of ere",
    ", it does diminish the probability that they are the source of ere .",
    "this is especially true when the minimum 10% photoluminescense efficiency of ere in the diffuse ism @xcite is considered .",
    "@xcite chose to only model carbon nanoparticles with @xmath6 bonds specifically so that the particles would have a high photoluminescence efficiency .",
    "carbon nanoparticles with @xmath6 and @xmath7 bonds of different sizes have been produced in the lab @xcite and have a negligible photoluminescence efficiency ( n.  herlin , private communication ) .",
    "thus , the main problem with carbon nanoparticles being responsible for ere is their low efficiency as measured in the laboratory .",
    "the @xcite carbon nanoparticles model can account for this , but the lack of a 1.0  @xmath0 peak in ngc 7023 does not confirm their model .",
    "it is likely the @xcite model can be modified to account for our new observations ( w.  duley , private communication ) , but their model needs to make predictions which are confirmed by observations or be directly supported by laboratory work before carbon nanoparticles can be convincingly identified with ere . as such it is worth noting that silicon nanoparticles do a better job of reproducing the observed characteristics of ere and their characteristics",
    "are supported by laboratory measurements @xcite .",
    "we have found tentative additional evidence for silicon nanoparticles in our observations which is discussed below .      the unexpected result of this study is the evidence for at least one , and possibly two , previously unobserved , broad emission features which peak in the near - infrared .",
    "examining our spectra of ngc 7023 and those in the literature @xcite , the new features are seen in only part of the northwest filament ( see figs .",
    "[ fig_pos ] and [ fig_comp_neb ] ) . in order to show the profiles and relative strengths of the new features as well as the ere band",
    ", we display the spectrum of the intensity of the northwest filament , with the scattering spectrum for @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_neb]b ) subtracted in fig .",
    "[ fig_feature_id ] .",
    "this spectrum is due to excess _ emission _ arising from the dust and gas in the northwest filament . here",
    "we will focus solely on the dust emission components .",
    "we identify three discrete emission features , in addition to a broad continuum which increases in intensity toward longer wavelengths .",
    "this broad continuum has been previously identified as non - equilibrium thermal emission from stochastically heated tiny particles in the sub - nm size range @xcite .",
    "the discrete features in the northwest filament have peaks at 0.68 , 1.15 , and 1.50  @xmath0 , and widths characteristic of solid - state photoluminescence bands .",
    "the 0.68 band is the well known ere band .",
    "the strongest of the two new bands is at 1.50  @xmath0 and is similar in strength and width to the visible ere band at 0.68  @xmath0 .",
    "no interstellar band with these characteristics has ever been reported before in this wavelength region .",
    "given the strength of this band , an origin in a photoluminescence process involving solids made from heavily depleted abundant refractory elements is strongly suggested .",
    "the only band we found , after an extensive search of the astronomy and physics literature , fitting this description is the photoluminescence band in the low - temperature , amorphous phase of iron disilicide ( @xmath1-fesi@xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "iron disilicide is a direct - bandgap semiconductor with a bandgap near 0.8 ev , in which cross - bandgap recombination of free electrons and holes produces photoluminescence similar to that observed in silicon nanoparticles .",
    "however , in contrast to the case in silicon , an indirect - bandgap semiconductor , fesi@xmath2 does not need to be in the form of nanoparticles in order to exhibit efficient photoluminescence .",
    "in fact , low - temperature fesi@xmath2 particles of about 100  nm diameter appear to be luminescing most efficiently , with the width of the band dependent upon the state of annealing , with relatively narrow bands seen only with annealing temperatures in excess of 900@xmath34  c. these temperatures are not likely to occur in large dust grains located in the ngc 7023 filaments as the radiation field density is unlikely to heat the dust grains to such high temperatures .",
    "thus , both the width and relative strength of the band at 1.5  @xmath0 are consistent with photoluminescence by low - temperature iron disilicide grains . in fig .",
    "[ fig_feature_id ] , we have plotted the laboratory fesi@xmath2 band profile which most closely fits the observed 1.5  @xmath0 feature .",
    "the observed profile does deviate from the laboratory profile on the long wavelength side .",
    "this deviation may be due to the fact that the laboratory profile is for a single particle size and the observed profile is likely the result of a population of different sized particles .",
    "we have no explanation at present why such grains are observable in the northwest filament and not in the south filament",
    ". more observations of this interesting new band in other reflection nebulae and under a wider range of physical conditions are clearly needed .",
    "our tentative identification of the new 1.5  @xmath0 feature with fesi@xmath2 dust grains is supported by two recent papers @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed chemical equilibrium calculations for a particular gas phase mixture deficient in carbon and oxygen and found that solid fesi is the first condensate of abundant refractory elements .",
    "they identify the previously unidentified , strong 47.5  @xmath0 feature in the spectrum of the evolved stars afgl 4106 @xcite as arising from fesi grains .",
    "it is possible that fesi@xmath2 could also form in similar mixtures of refractory elements ( h .- p .",
    "gail , private communication ) .",
    "@xcite presents a laboratory spectrum of fesi@xmath2 grains from 10 to 70  @xmath0 .",
    "the main features of this spectrum are bands at 21 , 27 , and 30 @xmath0 , and similar bands have been seen in iras and iso data @xcite .",
    "combining these two papers and our work imply that fesi@xmath2 dust grains could very well be present in the interstellar medium .",
    "additional observations are obviously needed , especially aperture matched observations from 1 to 35  @xmath0 .",
    "the weaker of the two new bands peaks around 1.15  @xmath0 and its presence in the northwest filament spectrum is tentative at best .",
    "additional observations are definitely required to confirm the presence of this feature .",
    "it is intriguing to note the wavelength location of the new 1.15  @xmath0 feature in light of recent laboratory work on silicon nanoparticles .",
    "laboratory studies of photoluminescence of silicon nanoparticles in the form of porous silicon or matrix - embedded nano - crystallites @xcite have produced evidence for the existence of a second , near - ir , photoluminescence band , in addition to the main optical band matching the ere .",
    "the peak wavelengths of these two bands , both subject to quantum confinement , vary with the size of the emitting particles and are closely correlated by the relation @xmath35 , \\label{eq_sinp}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the peak energies of the near - ir band and the visible band in ev , respectively @xcite . with",
    "the ere observed to peak at 0.68  @xmath0 in the northwest filament , eq .  [ eq_sinp ] predicts a peak wavelength for the near - ir band of 1.1  @xmath0 .",
    "we have indicated the silicon nanoparticle bands in accordance with laboratory results in fig .",
    "[ fig_feature_id ] .",
    "they provide very satisfactory fits to the observational data .",
    "the principal ere band in the visible is attributed to recombination of free electron - hole pairs in silicon nanoparticles ( si np in fig .",
    "[ fig_feature_id ] ) @xcite , while the near - ir band from the same type of particles is attributed to recombination of photoexcited electrons from the conduction band to in - bandgap defect sites associated with si dangling bonds at the surfaces of silicon nano - crystallites @xcite .",
    "the near - ir band is observed in the laboratory only at temperatures of @xmath38 , while the visible band remains strong at higher temperatures .",
    "the relative strength of the two bands also depends on the degree of passivation of surface dangling bonds . with increasing passivation ( e.g. , with oxygen atoms )",
    "the near - ir band decreases in strength while the visible band gains in strength .",
    "the fact that only the northwest filament shows the near - ir band near 1.15  @xmath0 but both the south and the northwest filaments display the visible ere band is thus easily explained .",
    "the maximum temperature reached by individual nanoparticles in the south filament upon absorption of individual photons is either higher than the corresponding temperature of nanoparticles in the northwest filament , or the degree of passivation is higher in the south filament .",
    "the first explanation seems more likely in view of the higher optical depth of the northwest filament ( @xmath39 ) compared to the more optically thin south filament ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "energetic photons are thus less likely to reach nanoparticles in the northwest filament . @xcite estimated that a 1.7  nm diameter si nanoparticle experiences a temperature increase of @xmath41170 k upon absorbing a 10  ev photon . we conclude that the average maximum temperature of the si nanoparticles in the northwest filament must be lower than those in the south filament , low enough to allow the near - ir band to be observable .",
    "given that the visible ere band has been observed with peak wavelengths ranging from 0.65 to 0.88  @xmath0 in different environments , eq .",
    "[ eq_sinp ] predicts the possible existence of corresponding near - ir bands with peak wavelengths spanning the range from 1.07 to 1.31  @xmath0 .",
    "detection of such bands with wavelengths fitting the correlation in eq .",
    "[ eq_sinp ] would be a powerful confirmation of the silicon nanoparticle model for the ere .",
    "additional observations in the near - ir region such as reported here are clearly needed .",
    "from new 0.35 to 2.5 @xmath0 spectra of the south and northwest filaments in the reflection nebula ngc 7023 , we conclude that :    * the 1.0 @xmath0 feature predicted by @xcite is not seen .",
    "this result when combined with the negligible measured photoluminescence efficiency of carbon nanoparticles calls into question the identification of carbon nanoparticles as the source for ere . *",
    "we have discovered a new strong and broad dust emission feature which peaks at 1.5  @xmath0 , and we tentatively identify it with photoluminescence from @xmath1-fesi@xmath2 grains . * we have also found tentative evidence for another new broad , dust emission feature at 1.15  @xmath0 .",
    "we identify this feature with photoluminescence from transitions from the conduction band to defect states in silicon nanoparticles .",
    "if this is correct , it lends support to the identification of silicon nanoparticles as the carrier of ere .",

    "<S> the northwest filament spectrum does show one , and possibly two , new dust emission features in the near - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly detect a strong emission band at 1.5  @xmath0 which we tentatively attribute to @xmath1-fesi@xmath2 grains . </S>",
    "<S> we tentatively detect a weaker emission band at 1.15  @xmath0 which coincides with the location expected for transitions from the conduction band to mid - gap defect states of silicon nanoparticles . </S>",
    "<S> this is added evidence that silicon nanoparticles are responsible for ere as they already can explain the observed behavior of the main visible ere band . </S>"
