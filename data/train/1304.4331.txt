    "it is therefore enough to consider the system at @xmath22 and study the change of the order of the chiral phase transition at finite @xmath19 .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of the njl model at zero temperature can be written as  @xcite @xmath154 where @xmath155 with @xmath156 . here",
    "@xmath157 corresponds to the 4-fermion njl coupling constant , and in agreement with the notation of the main text we have put @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the last addendum on the r.h.s . of",
    "the above equation corresponds to the valence quarks contributions .",
    "the vacuum part is regularized by cutting the momentum integral at the scale @xmath160 .",
    "our strategy is as follows : we perform a ginzburg - landau expansion of the effective potential , @xmath161 where we have subtracted an irrelevant term which does not depend on the condensate . at zero temperature and finite chemical potential the coefficients are easily determined from an expansion of eq .   around @xmath162 .",
    "we get @xmath163 we notice that @xmath164 causing the potential to be bounded from below . as a consequence it is possible to study the phase transition studying the signs of the first two coefficients .",
    "the phase transition is of first ( second ) order if @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) . at the critical point ,",
    "where the first and second order transition lines meet , one has @xmath167 .",
    "solving @xmath168 leads to a relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; using the solution of the latter in the equation @xmath169 leads to the critical value of @xmath170 at which the cp hits the @xmath22 plane , namely @xmath171 using the standard parameters of the model  @xcite we find @xmath172 mev .",
    "this result shows that finite @xmath20 changes the order of the chiral phase transition at zero temperature and finite chemical potential .    the fact that finite @xmath20 leads to the softening of the phase transition can be grasped from eq .  ; in fact , for @xmath173 one has @xmath174 the above equation shows that @xmath175 makes @xmath176 less negative , thus favoring a second order phase transition.the same conclusion can be drawn by using an extended version of the gl analysis including derivative terms  @xcite .",
