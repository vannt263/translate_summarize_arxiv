    "reactions with charge  asymmetric systems open the possibility to learn about the properties of the symmetry term of the nuclear interaction in conditions of density and temperature away from the ordinary values .",
    "in particular , the study of multi - fragmentation mechanisms in neutron ",
    "rich systems should allow to get information on the behaviour of the symmetry energy in density regions below saturation , where the nuclear system may undergo a liquid ",
    "gas phase transition .",
    "constraints on the form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy are important not only for a better knowledge of the nucleon  nucleon interaction , and hence its extrapolation to the structure of exotic nuclei @xcite , but also for the study of the neutron star crust , and of supernova explosions , where a key issue is the clustering of low  density matter @xcite .    the dynamics of first ",
    "order phase transitions is often induced by instabilities against fluctuations of the order parameter . in dissipative heavy ion collisions , nuclear matter may be pushed inside the coexistence region of the nuclear liquid - gas phase diagram .",
    "then , the observed abundant fragment formation may take place through a rapid amplification of spinodal instabilities .",
    "experimental results pleading in favor of such a spinodal decomposition have recently been reported @xcite .",
    "spinodal instabilities in charge - asymmetric systems have been widely investigated from the theoretical point of view .",
    "the most important effect induced by the charge asymmetry is the so - called isospin distillation : fragments ( liquid ) appear more symmetric with respect to the initial matter , while light particles ( gas ) are more neutron  rich @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of this effect depends on specific properties of the isovector part of the nuclear interaction , namely on the value and the derivative of the symmetry energy at low density @xcite . moreover , apart from the distillation effect , that determines the average fragment isotopic composition , the symmetry energy value influences also the width of the isotopic distributions",
    "this feature has been recently exploited in the so  called isoscaling analysis @xcite , where information on the symmetry energy behaviour is extracted from the study of ratio of the isotope yields obtained from two reactions with different charge asymmetry @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a detailed study of isotopic properties of nucleon clusters , as obtained within the spinodal decomposition scenario . in order to select this mechanism ,",
    "we consider nuclear matter initialized at a given temperature and at low density , inside a box with periodic boundary conditions , under the action of a stochastic field self  consistently determined @xcite . in this case , the normal modes of the density fluctuations are plane waves .",
    "the instabilities are treated in the linear approximation , i.e. retaining only first ",
    "order terms in the stochastic field or in the density fluctuations .",
    "this leads to a quasi  analytical description of the growth of instabilities and the consequent formation of clusters of nucleons , that can be considered as excited primary fragments . for each considered system , a large variety of possible outcomes",
    "may be obtained , according to the initial density fluctuation values . in this way it is possible to collect a large number of events with much reduced computational effort , allowing to perform a thorough analysis of the isotopic content of nucleon clusters , the isospin distillation and isotopic distributions , in connection with the ingredients of the effective nuclear interaction employed .",
    "we would like to stress that our analysis refers essentially to the early break - up of the system , where excited nucleon clusters , reflecting the nuclear matter properties , can be recognized . at this level , shell effects , that influence the n / z ratio of real nuclei , are not considered . in particular , we will discuss the relation between isotopic properties and density of the primary fragments ( at the moment of fragment formation ) .",
    "in fact , in the spinodal decomposition scenario , domains with different density values , from which clusters of nucleons eventually emerge , coexist .",
    "clusters of intermediate mass , that may originate from the vapour phase or from the liquid phase as well , may have different isotopic properties , depending on the density value of the domain where they are formed .",
    "for instance , the isospin distillation mechanism , that is a feature of isoscalarlike oscillations , is more and more effective as soon as the density gets larger in the domain considered .    in the actual disassembly of a nuclear system ( in central nuclear collisions )",
    "the vapour phase is generally formed at the surface of the system , where also a larger radial collective flow is observed . hence one could expect a relation between fragment isotopic observables and kinematical properties @xcite .",
    "in particular , as we will discuss in the following , clusters emerging from low density regions should be more neutron  rich and with wider isotopic distributions .",
    "these features are peculiar of the spinodal decomposition scenario and of the occurrence of first  order liquid",
    " gas transitions .",
    "hence , in addition to the information that can be gained about the low ",
    "density behaviour of the symmetry energy , this investigation would allow to shed some light on the fragmentation mechanism itself .",

    "dissipation theorem the stochastic field is self  consistently determined . for nuclear matter in the spinodal region the time growth of fluctuations is essentially due to the unstable mean field .",
    "therefore we neglect the effects of nucleon - nucleon collisions in the time evolution of fluctuations .",
    "collisions would mainly add a damping to the growth rate of the fluctuations and should not change the main results of our calculations , at least at a qualitative level .",

    "@xcite has reference to infinite nuclear matter , thus normal modes are plane waves associated with wave numbers @xmath0 .",
    "the growth of fluctuations leads to the formation of large density domains , that can be associated with fragments . in refs .",
    "@xcite the fragment recognition is based on a procedure which allows to determine the probability distribution of the domains containing correlated density fluctuations .",
    "we have then identified the pattern of correlated domains with the fragmentation pattern .",
    "in such a way , we could make predictions on the distributions of clusters .",
    "this procedure is based on an `` ansatz '' which relates the gaussian distributions for the different modes of density fluctuations to the probability distribution of the correlated domains in the ordinary space .    in the present paper",
    "we follow a different strategy . from the probability distributions of fluctuations in the @xmath0 space , induced by the stochastic field",
    ", we directly generate a certain number of events characterized by stochastic distributions of density fluctuations in the coordinate space .",
    "this is accomplished by performing a fourier expansion in a finite cubic lattice of volume @xmath2 .    in this way",
    "a substantial improvement of the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite is obtained .",
    "event by event analyses can be performed .",
    "moreover , one can investigate new features of the fragmentation process , such as , for instance , the isotopic content of nucleon clusters as a function of their density .",
    "the key quantity for the evaluation of the density fluctuations is the density  density response function . in a linear approximation for the stochastic field ,",
    "the fourier transform of the response function is given by the equation @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the non  interacting particle  hole propagator and @xmath5 is the fourier transform of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon effective interaction .",
    "the subscripts of the various quantities take the values @xmath6 and @xmath7 for protons and neutrons respectively . in this paper",
    "we use units such that @xmath8 .    in asymmetric nuclear matter isovector and isoscalar",
    "fluctuations are coupled .",
    "however one can still separate oscillations with neutrons and protons moving in phase ( isoscalarlike ) or out of phase ( isovectorlike ) and add the contributions of the corresponding variances .",
    "this can be done because the time scales of isoscalarlike oscillations and of isovectorlike oscillations are very different for nuclear matter with values of temperature and density sufficiently close to the borders of the spinodal region .",
    "indeed , the growth rate of the unstable isoscalarlike modes , @xmath9 , turns out to be much smaller than the real frequencies , @xmath10 , of isovectorlike modes @xcite .",
    "thus the two kinds of fluctuations can be considered two independent stochastic processes .",
    "in addition , for the relevant values of the magnitude of the wave vector @xmath11 , the following inequalities @xmath12 and @xmath13 hold .    as a consequence of the linear approximation for the stochastic field ,",

    "the covariance matrix for the isoscalarlike fluctuations @xmath17 can be evaluated taking the classical ( thermodynamical ) limit @xmath18 of the fluctuation  dissipation relation .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 are the residues , times @xmath20 , of the response function at the pole @xmath21 @xcite .    since the time scale of the isovectorlike fluctuations is much shorter than that of the growth of the unstable modes , for the covariance matrix of the isovectorlike fluctuations we can take its asymptotic value for @xmath22 , with nuclear matter at given values of density , temperature and asymmetry , @xmath23 where @xmath24 represent the residues of the response function at the real pole @xmath10 .",
    "this equation has been obtained by exploiting the fluctuation  dissipation theorem , now in the limit @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that , in the low temperature limit , the isovector fluctuation amplitude is essentially different from the value expected at the thermodynamical limit , @xmath26 , where the fluctuation variance is proportional to the temperature and inversely related to the value of the symmetry energy @xcite .    with the aim to preserve a simple formalism , which , to some extent , allows us to perform calculations analytically , we have evaluated the response function of eq .",

    "firstly , for @xmath36 the variance , which relaxes towards its asymptotic value since @xmath37 , remains appreciably larger than its limit @xmath35 for @xmath33 .",
    "secondly , the latter is approached already for values of @xmath11 slightly larger than @xmath38 , as it can be shown by explicit calculations including quantum effects .",
    "the non  accurate evaluation of the response function in the interval @xmath39 should not introduce sizeable effects , since the values of the variance in this interval is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the most unstable mode .      in the present paper",

    "the density dependence of the potential part of the symmetry ",
    "energy density can be expressed by @xmath54 with @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xcite , for the `` superstiff '' case , and @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite , for the `` soft '' case .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath60 is nothing but the potential part of the symmetry ",
    "energy coefficient divided by @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the inclusion of the coulomb interaction gives rise to an overall decrease of the growth rate of density fluctuations with a corresponding contraction of the instability region in the ( @xmath63 ) phase diagram @xcite .",
    "proton and neutron densities oscillate in phase and out of phase , respectively in the isoscalarlike fluctuations and in the isovectorlike fluctuations , although with different amplitudes in general .",
    "the ratio between amplitudes is given by @xmath64 , with @xmath65 for the isoscalarlike case and with @xmath66 for isovectorlike case .",
    "the above relation follows from the relevant property @xmath67 of the residues .",
    "hence , for asymmetric matter , even in unstable isoscalarlike oscillations that lead to phase separation , protons and neutrons move with different amplitude .",
    "in particular one observes that the ratio between proton and neutron fluctuations is larger than the @xmath68 ratio of the original matter , leading to a more symmetric liquid phase , the so  called isospin distillation effect @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the proton and neutron density fluctuations is mostly determined by the isoscalarlike fluctuations .",
    "this is simply related to the fact that during the spinodal decomposition , the isoscalarlike fluctuations are much larger than the isovectorlike ones .",
    "thus , this ratio , for a given value of @xmath11 , can be put as : @xmath69 where the ratio of the residues at the imaginary pole , @xmath70 , of @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 the non  interacting particle ",

( [ ratiore1 ] ) becomes @xmath80 where @xmath81 with @xmath82 , is the sum of the kinetic and entropy terms of the free  energy density , i.e. @xmath83 represents the free  energy density of a non - interacting two  component fermi gas with effective chemical potentials @xmath74 .    for a qualitative analysis",

    "however , it should be remarked that the derivative of @xmath60 depends on the density .",

    ", it is generally not easy to single out from the isospin  dependent interaction , @xmath93 , a term which can play a conclusive role in determining the widths of isotopic distributions . only for @xmath94 and , in addition , neglecting the coulomb interaction , isovector and isoscalar fluctuations are decoupled . in this case",
    "the fluctuations @xmath89 are only due to the isovector modes , and the residues at the real pole @xmath10 are solely determined by the coefficient @xmath60 in the expression of the symmetry energy of eq .",

    "terms containing derivatives of @xmath60 contribute to the magnitude of the residues @xmath24 as well .",
    "generally speaking , one can expect that the strength of the isovector pole increases with the coefficient @xmath60 .",
    "hence , in the limit considered here , @xmath95 , isovector fluctuations becomes larger when increasing the symmetry energy coefficient .",
    "it should be noticed that also for @xmath96 the contributions to @xmath89 of the isoscalarlike modes still tend to cancel out .",
    "we consider a finite cubic lattice of volume @xmath2 .",
    "we assume the density vanishing at the surface of the box .",
    "the number of nucleons is then fixed and in the box the liquid and vapour phases coexist . moreover ,",
    "finite size effects can be taken into account in this way .",
    "however , it should be remarked that the condition of vanishing density at the border of the box imposes some symmetries to the problem .",
    "in fact , in this case the number of independent oscillations is reduced by @xmath97 . accordingly , due to the imposed symmetries , also fluctuations variances are reduced .",
    "this is not so important in the isoscalarlike case , since these modes are unstable and fluctuations are amplified anyway . on the contrary ,",
    "isovectorlike fluctuations remain quenched ( by a factor @xmath98 ) .",
    "however , this does not affect our conclusions about the relative comparison of the results obtained with the different parametrizations of the symmetry energy .    in order to extract the spatial density @xmath99",

    "furthermore , the weighting procedure of the different fluctuation modes in ref .",
    "@xcite could likely underestimate the isovectorlike fluctuations .",
    "now we show that the amplitude of the isospin distillation effect , as well as the variances of the isotopic distributions , is related to the value of the density reached in the different domains associated with nucleon clusters .    due to the beating of the several unstable modes , clusters with a given charge",

    "we notice that , due to the distillation effect , @xmath143 . from the expression given",
    "above , one can see that the ratio @xmath1 of a given cluster decreases when the density @xmath61 of the domain increases , i.e. @xmath140 ( and @xmath139 ) are larger .",
    "in fact , larger densities are associated with larger isoscalarlike fluctuations and thus with a larger distillation . on the other hand ,",
    "clusters in the vapour phase , having density smaller than the initial one ( @xmath144 ) , show a larger value of the ratio @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the deviation of the ratio @xmath1 with respect to the initial value @xmath145 increases as far as the ratio @xmath146 gets smaller , i.e. for parametrizations of the symmetry energy that lead to larger distillation effect . in fig .",

    "we also expect a decreasing behaviour with density .",
    "in fact isovectorlike fluctuations , that are mainly responsible of the isotopic variance , in our linear approach are implemented according to the properties ( density , asymmetry , temperature ) of the initial matter .",
    "then , nucleon clusters with larger density should have narrower isotopic distributions due to the larger contribution of the isoscalarlike modes with respect to isovectorlike fluctuations .",
    "the probability distribution for the isovector density fluctuations @xmath147 in a given domain of volume @xmath2 can be approximatively expressed as : @xmath148 where the variance @xmath149 can be evaluated starting from the value of @xmath150 of eq .",

    "this is confirmed by our calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where we plot the variance of the @xmath90 distribution , averaged over all clusters with volume @xmath155 , as a function of @xmath156 . from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] one can also see that , especially in the case of the `` superstiff '' interaction , the variance is smaller for the neutron richer system ( compare squares and crosses ) .",
    "moreover , for a given volume , variances are larger in the `` soft '' case .",
    "if we consider now clusters with a given mass @xmath157 , on can easily realize that the isotopic distributions will depend on the cluster density , being broader for clusters with smaller density ( i.e. larger volume ) .",

    "in this paper we have considered a piece of asymmetric nuclear matter contained in a cubic box with impenetrable walls .",
    "the values of density and temperature of the system are inside the spinodal instability region of the phase diagram .",
    "we have mainly focused our attention on the isotopic distributions of clusters coming from the break  up of the system .    in our approach",
    "the density fluctuations are considered within a linear approximation , then our results refer to nuclear matter being not deeply inside the unstable spinodal region .",
    "such physical situation can occur in central collisions of heavy ions at moderate energy ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "moreover , we remark that our investigation concerns the distributions just after the early break  up of the nuclear system .",
    "it has been found that , at the considered values of density and asymmmetry , the global features of the disassembly , the isospin distillation effect included , are essentially determined by the unstable isoscalarlike fluctuations of the density , while the widths of the isotopic distributions are mostly affected by the isovectorlike oscillations .    within",
    "the model developed it is possible to recognize clusters originating from domains having different density values .",
    "discerning clusters with density lower or higher than the initial density , we have observed a clear occurrence of the isospin distillation effect : low  density clusters are more neutron  rich than the initial system , correspondingly the opposite happens for higher density clusters . as a general trend the average value of the @xmath1 ratio decreases with increasing the cluster density",
    "this effect results to be enhanced for more charge  asymmetric systems .",
    "moreover , it has been found that the isotopic distributions of clusters belonging to the low density phase are broader than those of clusters belonging to the high density phase .",
    "hence larger distillation effects are associated with narrower isotopic distributions , at least within our linear treatment of fluctuations .",
    "this feature , if it survives the secondary decay of primary fragments , could be qualitatively checked in experiments by comparing the isotopic distributions of light clusters , that should emerge from the low - density phase , and intermediate mass fragments , most likely associated with higher density regions . however , at the present level of investigation , a careful comparison with experiments would require a reconstruction of the properties of the primary fragments , based on actual experimental data @xcite .    in order to stress the sensitivity of the results to the isovector part of the nuclear interaction , we have presented calculations obtained with two different parametrizations of the symmetry energy . for the values of charge  asymmetry considered , we have seen that isospin effects are essentially related to the values of the coefficient of the symmetry energy and of its derivative with respect to the density . in particular",
    ", the former quantity mainly determines the width of the isotopic distributions , while the latter quantity plays a crucial role for determining the strength of the isospin distillation .",
    "however , it should be remarked that the symmetry energy properties depend on the density reached by the system during the decomposition process .",
    "then , the effectiveness of a given parametrization of the symmetry energy for the isospin distillation depends on the actual path followed by the nuclear system in the density  temperature phase diagram .",
