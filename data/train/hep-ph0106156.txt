    "recently , the e866/nusea collaboration @xcite has released the final results corresponding to the analysis of their full data set of drell - yan yields from an 800 gev / c proton beam on hydrogen and deuterium targets .",
    "this analysis , aimed to size the @xmath0 asymmetry in the proton , has confirmed previous measurements by e866 @xcite , but with a substantial increase in precision and extending the kinematical coverage .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath0 asymmetry in the proton has been pursued in recent years by several groups @xcite , triggered by the nmc collaboration measurement of deep inelastic muon scattering from hydrogen and deuterium targets , which suggested that the @xmath1 quark content in the proton was larger than that of the @xmath2 quarks @xcite .",
    "the ongoing interest in this issue has been not only the verification a hitherto unexpected flavour symmetry breakdown , presumably of non - perturbative origin , but also the precise determination of the ratio @xmath0 , as required by modern global qcd fits of parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "these global analyses are an essential ingredient in the perturbative qcd description of hadrons and their hard interactions , and in recent years have evolved in accuracy and sophistication along the increase in precision of data @xcite .",
    "indeed , prior to nmc finding , global extractions of parton distributions were made under the assumption of flavour symmetry for the light sea quarks ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "most recent sets , however , were constrained to satisfy either nmc or , more likely , e866 data , imposition that also influences the extraction of valence quark densities @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice at this point , that the constraints on sea quark densities coming from the various asymmetry measurements are not necessarily equivalent and , eventually , they influence in different ways the extraction of parton densities in global fits .",
    "these differences are most noticeable when comparing for example e866 drell yan data and nmc results on the difference between the proton and the neutron structure functions . in other words ,",
    "global fits designed to accommodate e866 data fail to reproduce that coming from nmc , and conversely .    given the accuracy of modern parton distributions , and the fact that @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as well as e866 data are nicely accounted for by them , it is somewhat surprising that they fail to reproduce @xmath6 data at intermediate values of the variable @xmath7 , as shown in figure 1 .",

    ", it is worthwhile analysing to what extent parton distributions are affected by the different alternatives .    in order to assess the impact of different results on the @xmath0 asymmetry in the extraction of parton distribution functions , we perform in this paper a leading order ( lo ) qcd global extraction of parton densities from a large set of dis data as usual , but forcing the agreement with one particular flavour asymmetry measurement ( nmc , e866 , or hermes ) as an _ ad hoc _ constraint in the fit",
    "this is accomplished giving to the ` preferred ' data set a larger statistical weight than it actually has , and it is done also in order to increase the little relative statistical relevance that they have against the bulk of dis data .    as result of this approach",
    "we find that even though one can produce parton densities using either e866 or nmc data to implement the flavour symmetry breaking , the constraints that these sets of data impose on the distributions can not be satisfied simultaneously in any way .",
    "hermes data show a similar conflict with nmc , but is in rather good agreement with e866 .",
    "parton distributions in agreement with e866/hermes symmetry breaking scenario lead in the fits to lower global @xmath8 values than those that reproduce nmc data , and the shape of the sea and valence quark densities of these extreme scenarios show clearly noticeable differences .",
    "in the following section we summarize the main features of the parton distributions parameterizations used , the @xmath9-evolution strategy , and the data included in the global analyses .",
    "then we present the outcome of the three fits in which either e866 , nmc , or hermes data have been favored , against the standard one in which no additional weights have been applied .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions .",
    "in order to parameterize quark densities at the initial scale @xmath10 we adopt the standard functional dependence as in  @xcite : @xmath11 for valence quarks ; @xmath12 for the sum of light sea quarks and antiquarks ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 for gluons . in order to be consistent with ccfr data on dimuon production  @xcite , strange sea quarks",

    "as it was stated above , it is clear that the last four sets of data in table 1 have very little statistical weight relative to dis data . in order to preserve the information contained in them , and",

    "this set has a close resemblance with mrst , and clearly favors the agreement with e866 data relative to that with nmc .",
    "however , at variance with mrst , because it includes explicitely nmc data , it also reproduces it slightly better .",
    "it is also very similar to the unweighted fit , labeled as fit 0 , due to the fact that e866 data has by itself the largest constraining power of the three sets of data . in table 2",

    "the agreement with nmc is completely lost ( @xmath41 ) , and it is even worse than in set i.    it is interesting to notice that the most striking difference between the sea quark densities inspired in the e866/hermes and nmc scenarios , respectively , is that whereas nmc data favors @xmath1 quark densities up to more than twice larger that @xmath2 ones , both e866 and hermes lead to not so large @xmath0 ratios , as shown in figure 3a .",
    "there is also a clear difference in the value of momentum fraction at which the ratio reaches its maximum , which in turn determines the position of the peak of the @xmath42 distribution .",

    "we have analysed the consequences of different measurements of the ratio @xmath0 asymmetry in the extraction of parton distributions .",

    "the issue of uncertainties in parton distribution functions , and their precise origin , is a highly relevant one , that will certainly require further attention in the near future .",
    "nuclear effects when using deuterium targets is a more or less obvious source of uncertainties in the flavour asymmetry measurements we have deal with . but at variance with the most conventional estimates for nuclear effects in deuterium , which lead to small corrections in the nmc observable at very small and large momentum fractions , the discrepancies between parton densities inspired in nmc data and those in agreement with e866 or hermes data are concentrated at intermediate values of @xmath7 .",
    "these results suggest that even though the breakdown of the isospin symmetry in the sea of nucleons is indeed one of the reasons for the gottfried sum rule deficit observed by nmc , it is far from being the answer to the question raised almost ten years ago .",
