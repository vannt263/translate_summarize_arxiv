    "the cms and alice experiments at the cern lhc have chosen these crystals for their electromagnetic calorimeters @xcite,@xcite .",
    "an electromagnetic calorimeter made of pbwo@xmath4 crystals has also been selected as the baseline for the btev experiment . unlike cms or alice btev ecal is not in a high magnetic field , so we can use photomultiplier tubes rather than avalanche photodiodes or vacuum phototriodes .",
    "this should provide less noise and better resolution at low energies . according to the pbwo@xmath4 manufacturers specifications the expected light collection is @xmath55000 photoelectrons at 1 gev .",
    "the performance of lead tungstate crystals produced in bogoroditsk techno - chemical plant ( btcp ) and shanghai institute of ceramics ( sic ) has been studied at the accelerator u70 in protvino , russia in 2001 .",
    "the specific goals were to understand how to set specifications for crystal production and measure the predicted energy and position resolution .",
    "the btev ecal testbeam setup consisted of a @xmath6 array of pbwo@xmath4 crystals coupled to ten - stage photomultiplier tubes , a beam with a momentum tagging system on individual particles and a trigger system using scintillation counters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : beam_setup ] ) .",
    "the crystals had a square cross - section of 27@xmath727  mm@xmath8 and were 220 mm long and wrapped with 170@xmath9 m tyvec .",
    "pbwo@xmath4 light yield strongly depends on temperature @xcite,@xcite . to eliminate the effects of temperature variation crystals",
    "were placed inside a thermally insulated light - tight box .",
    "we controlled the temperature in the box using a lauda cryothermostat with an accuracy of @xmath10  @xmath11c . to measure the temperature of the crystals , 24 separate temperature sensors were placed on the front and rear ends of various crystals .",
    "a moving platform was used to inject the beam on different points of the crystal matrix .",
    "the platform was designed to move in the both vertical and horizontal directions and was controlled remotely .",
    "the box was placed on a revolving table mounted on the platform .",
    "rotation of the table was important for studying an angular resolution and optical transmission of the crystals .    in order to measure the energy resolution we need to take into account the electron beam energy spread which was 2 - 3% at high energies up to 45 gev and was 5 - 7% at low energies down to 1 gev .",
    "these values are significantly larger than expected performance of the crystals .",
    "thus we constructed a system that measured the momentum of each electron in the beam @xcite .",
    "it consisted of four drift chamber stations and an analyzing magnet .",
    "three stations had x and y chamber pairs , and the fourth one had only an x chamber pair .",
    "each chamber covered an area about @xmath12 cm@xmath8 .",
    "a gas mixture of 70% ar and 30% isobutane was used .",
    "the position resolution of the chambers was 160  @xmath9 m .",
    "an electron momentum was measured with a resolution of 0.13% at 45 gev where the multiple scattering was negligible . at 1 gev",
    "the resolution of 2% was caused mainly by multiple scattering of electrons on materials along the beam line ( the flanges of the vacuum tubes and drift chambers , 0.006 of radiation length in total . )",
    "the positions of the beam telescope scintillating counters s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 are shown in fig .",

    "counters sizes were 10  cm in diameter for s1 , s2 and s3 and @xmath14  cm for s4 .",
    "the coincidence of the signals from these counters formed the main beam trigger .",
    "the finger counters f@xmath15 and f@xmath16 with sizes 5  mm were used mainly in calibration and precise energy resolution measurements to limit the beam size .",
    "data acquisition ( daq ) was camac - based and pc - controlled using vme ( see fig .  [",

    "the daq system consisted of    * camac crate with an adc system for crystals readout , * tdc modules measuring the timing of drift chambers signals , and * trigger logic .",

    "it also provided interrupts to control daq program flow .",
    "the daq programs ran in a pc under linux operating system .",
    "a bit3 pci - vme interface was used to communicate with the vme crate .",
    "the fermilab software tool histoscope was used both as run - control frame and for a simple on - line analysis of the data .",
    "data also were sent to another computer for more detailed analysis and archiving .",
    "this was implemented by pipe and tcp / ip socket system calls .",
    "the slow control subsystem included    * high voltage control and monitoring by lecroy 1440 hv power supply , * temperature control of the crystal s box using the lauda cryothermostat , * monitoring of temperatures in the crystal matrix by a set of thermistors , * monitoring of the phototubes gains via pulsed led , * the moving platform control elements .",
    "light from each crystal was viewed by a pmt through an optical grease coupling .",
    "we used r5800 hamamatsu phototubes equipped with transistorized bases developed at fermilab .",
    "high voltage to the tubes was supplied by a lecroy 1440 hv system .",
    "signals were sent to the control room patch - panel without any connection to ground inside the crystal box to avoid ground loops .",
    "lecroy 2285 15-bits integrating adc modules were used to measure the signal charge within 150 ns gate , chosen to be somewhat longer than the natural decay time of the crystals , where we expect 99% of the light in 100 ns .",
    "the adc sensitivity could be programmed with a power controller module . during",
    "most of our studies we used 30 fc per count .",
    "signals from drift chamber sense wires were sent to amplifier - discriminator cards that were installed on the chambers .",
    "we used upd16 cards produced by the ihep electronics department with a @xmath17 threshold .",
    "the output from the upd16 was a balanced ecl signal with an 80 ns width .",
    "the output signal went to a tdc input using a 60-meter twisted - pair cable and started the tdc conversion operation .",

    "one of the problems in high precision measurements is the long - term stability of measuring devices . placing the crystal matrix together with photomultipliers into a thermoinsulated box",
    "we have reduced already the influence of the temperature , which is the most important instability factor .",
    "but we still had some electronics outside the box . besides , some other factors ( such as photomultiplier gain dependence on mean anode current ) might cause drift in the output signal . to monitor and take into account possible drift ,",
    "a led pulser system was implemented .",
    "a generator fired the super - bright blue led with 470 nm wavelength , that provided light to 50 fibers .",
    "each fiber was fed to one ( crystal+pmt+adc ) channel of the setup . to monitor the stability of the led pulser we used 2 pin - diodes hamamtsu s6468 - 05 as well as a dedicated pmt with calibrated light from a light source with yap : ce crystal @xcite . the led pulses had the height 23 times less and the width similar to those of the scintillation light produced in the pbwo@xmath4 crystal by 27 gev electron .",
    "the led was triggered by the daq system 10 times during each of the intervals between accelerator spills .",
    "this provided enough statistics to accurately monitor the stability every few minutes .",
    "we had checked the stability of the led pulser relative to the yap : ce calibrated light and found it was better 0.1% during at least 15 hours .",
