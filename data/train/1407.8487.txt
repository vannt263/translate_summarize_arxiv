    "the correlated - mode coupling can be understood generally for multi - mode , two particle quantum states , which very closely approximates the spdc output .",
    "this multi - mode two particle quantum state can be written as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are creation operators for the two output particles , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( commonly called signal and idler photons for spdc ) .",
    "the index @xmath11 enumerates the modes available to particle @xmath9 and @xmath12 enumerates the modes available to particle @xmath10 .",
    "the function @xmath13 is the mode probability amplitude for the two particle state .",
    "we can associate the single collected modes of particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 with modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "relevant , mutually exclusive mode emission probabilities are the following : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the probability of both particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 emitted into the collected modes  meaning they would both be detected if a perfect collection and detection system were used . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the probabilities of only particle @xmath9 or only particle @xmath10 , respectively , emitted into the collected modes  meaning the partner particle is necessarily lost .",
    "the total probability for particle @xmath9 to be emitted into the collected mode ( independent of its partner ) is then @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , the total probability for particle @xmath10 to be emitted into the collected mode is @xmath21    a family of related conditional mode coupling efficiencies can then be defined depending on how the conditioning is done .",
    "there is the probability that particle @xmath9 is emitted into the collected mode , conditioned on particle @xmath10 being emitted into the collected mode  given by the formula @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , there is the probability that particle @xmath10 is emitted into the collected mode , conditioned on particle @xmath9 being emitted into the collected mode ",
    "given by the formula @xmath23 .",
    "finally , there is the symmetrically conditioned multiplicative average of these probabilities which we call the correlated - mode coupling efficiency @xmath24 : @xmath25 because @xmath24 is symmetric with respect to particles @xmath9 and @xmath10 , optimizing this metric yields a system with high coupling efficiencies for both particles .",
    "this is more useful because both particles have the desired coupling characteristics , although it is more difficult to realize experimentally .",
    "it is important to distinguish these mode coupling efficiencies , which are properties of the quantum state alone , from true heralding efficiencies , which depend upon details of the experiment .",
    "a family of heralding efficiencies can be defined depending , again , on how conditioning is done .",
    "the heralding efficiency for particle @xmath9 , with conditioning on particle @xmath10 is defined as the probability that particle @xmath9 is emitted into the collected mode , conditioned on particle @xmath10 being collected and detected ( described by @xmath22 ) , and that particle @xmath9 , once emitted into the collected mode , is transmitted or otherwise made available for some purpose ( described by efficiency @xmath26 ) .",
    "we see then that the heralding efficiency for particle @xmath9 is @xmath27 .",
    "the heralding efficiency for particle @xmath10 , conditioned on detecting particle @xmath9 , can be similarly defined , with the roles of @xmath9 and @xmath10 interchanged , and the symmetric heralding efficiency is the multiplicative average of these two efficiencies .    in these heralding efficiency formulas , the efficiency that the heralded particle is made available for some purpose @xmath26 is defined operationally , depending on the specific application . for example , if the application is to simply transmit the heralded particle to a specific location , @xmath26 would be the efficiency of transmission . alternatively ,",
    "if the application is analyzing detection statistics ( such as for a bell test measurement ) , the particle is only available for this purpose if it is ultimately detected , meaning that @xmath26 for this case is the product of the transmission efficiency to the detector and the detection efficiency of the detector itself .",
    "to determine the functional form of @xmath24 for our spdc system , we follow the theoretical treatment of bennink @xcite .",
    "we model the pump beam as having a gaussian spatial profile focused to the center of the nonlinear crystal with waist @xmath28 and wavenumber @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the index of refraction the pump beam experiences inside the crystal , @xmath31 is the optical frequency of the pump beam , and @xmath32 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the pump mode focal parameter is then defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the length of the nonlinear crystal .",
    "we similarly model the collected modes of photon @xmath9 and photon @xmath10 as having gaussian profiles focused at the center of the nonlinear crystal , both with waist @xmath35 , and wavenumbers @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the respective indices of refraction experienced inside the crystal , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the respective optical frequencies .",
    "the focal parameters for the collected modes of photon @xmath9 and photon @xmath10 are defined , respectively , as @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we model the pump mode and collected @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes as mutually collinear and all propagating along a crystal principal axis .",
    "the optical fields experience wavenumber mismatch @xmath44 inside the crystal and we model the crystal as having poling period @xmath45 that brings the nonlinear interaction into the quasi - phase - matching regime , whose strength is given by the effective nonlinearity of the crystal @xmath46 .",
    "for this system , the emission rate of photon @xmath9 into the collected mode per milliwatt of pump light @xmath47 , the emission rate of photon @xmath10 into the collected mode per milliwatt of pump light @xmath48 , and the emission rate of both photons from the correlated pair into the collected mode per milliwatt of pump light @xmath49 can be approximated as follows @xcite : @xmath50 in these equations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53    although these equations were formulated specifically for the conditions in the experiment reported here , the equations are generally applicable and accurate to about @xmath54 or better under common conditions , namely when : emission is in the visible or near ir ; the crystal is not very short ( @xmath55 ) ; the phase mismatch is small ( @xmath56 ) ; the group velocity dispersion is negligible ; and the focusing is not extremely tight ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the interested reader may refer to @xcite for a fuller discussion of the approximations underlying these formulas and the impact on their accuracy .",

    "we then finely aligned the pump beam with a pair of computer controlled steering mirrors and tuned the beam polarization with a half wave plate .",
    "we focused the beam with a 300 mm focal length lens to the center of a 1 cm long periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal .",

    "the ppktp crystal had a @xmath72 m poling period , designed to generate orthogonally polarized correlated photon pairs at 1560 nm from energy degenerate , collinear , type ii phase - matched spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "the relevant indices of refraction for this crystal were determined from the set of sellmeier equations in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we sent the spdc output through a second @xmath73 mm lens , which we called the collimation lens , located 1 focal length from the crystal that limited the spread of the multimode spdc output .",
    "we reflected the spdc output off four dichroic mirrors which filtered residual pump beam light and directed the spdc output through a reconfigurable , computer controlled zoom lens .",
    "a fiber incoupler then coupled the spdc photons into a single mode optical fiber .",
    "the computer controlled spdc zoom lens , in conjunction with the optical fiber acted as a spatial filter , allowing a single spatial mode  the collection mode  to be sorted out of the multimode spdc output .",
    "this spatial mode was characterized by the collection mode focal parameters @xmath64 and @xmath74 , however because both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 photons were collected with the same optical setup , the mode focal parameters differed only by which birefringent crystal index was as a multiplicative factor : @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "our experimental configuration allowed for collection mode focal parameters ranging from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "the fiber coupled spdc was then sent to one of two detection systems .",

    "these beneficial detector characteristics gave the novel capability to accurately and quickly measure the performance of our optical system in focus configurations ranging from those with high total count rates but low coincident count rates , to configurations with low total count rates with high @xmath82 values .",
    "in order to find the inherent source emission rates and @xmath24 values we must divide out the effects of detector efficiency , detector dark counts , and optical transmission efficiency . however , we must take care to account for these effects correctly , especially for the configuration with only one detector apparatus because blocking effects are then present .",

    "we rotated the input polarization to find both the maximum and minimum polarization dependent detection efficiencies , which correspond to orthogonal input polarizations .",
    "for the dual detector configuration , because both input polarizations were optimized separately , the relevant efficiency is the maximum efficiency .",
    "however , for the single detector configuration , we operated with the polarization setting that maximized coincident photon detection rate  which is bounded from below by the lowest detection rate  suggesting that both of the orthogonally polarized spdc photons were detected with the same , non - optimum , detection efficiency .",

    "<S> we report on a systematic experimental study of heralding efficiency and generation rate of telecom - band infrared photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion and coupled to single mode optical fibers . </S>",

    "<S> these results confirm theoretical treatments and demonstrate that very high overall heralding efficiencies can , in principle , be achieved in quantum optical systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that these results and techniques will be widely incorporated into future systems that require , or benefit from , a high heralding efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of quantum enabled technologies promises substantial benefit for applications such as increased computing power and enhanced cryptographic security @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the continued development of this field , however , faces significant obstacles . </S>",
    "<S> photonic systems can generate high quality quantum states ; but there is difficulty in efficiently detecting these states . </S>",
    "<S> one important photonic quantum state is the entangled photon pair state . </S>",
    "<S> a source of these photon pair states can be used as a heralded single photon source or , more importantly , it can be used in a bell test measurement that ensures quantum behavior of the photon pair . </S>",
    "<S> this type of use has been the focus of significant experimental effort recently because , with very efficient detection , it promises to enable bell test measurements that are free from both the detection and locality loopholes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these loopholes may be exploited  either naturally , or by a malicious attack  to make a classical system incorrectly appear to be acting in a quantum mechanical manner . </S>",
    "<S> closing the loopholes requires extraordinary effort , thus placing many of the benefits to quantum technologies that are afforded by bell measurements , as well as clarity on fundamental and philosophical considerations regarding the quantum nature of reality , beyond current reach @xcite .    in an ideal photon pair experiment </S>",
    "<S> one would detect both photons from the pair . </S>",
    "<S> however , system inefficiencies necessarily result in the loss of one or both of the photons from the pair . detecting both photons remains challenging even with state of the art superconducting single - photon detectors @xcite because the relevant characteristic is not simply the detector efficiency , but rather the more demanding total system efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> this total system efficiency is comprised of three component efficiencies : the detector efficiency @xmath1 , the transmission efficiency of the optical system @xmath2 , and what we call the correlated - mode coupling efficiency @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this correlated - mode coupling efficiency can be thought of as the inherent source efficiency ; it is the probability that one photon from the pair ( or a noise photon from the source ) couples to a detector , given that its pair photon ( or , again , a noise photon from the source ) has been coupled to a detector . because @xmath3 is a conditional probability and deals with system - dependent multi - mode photon pair emission structure , it is more complex than the other component efficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> there has been comparatively little , but nevertheless promising , research specifically investigating this effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a better understanding and characterization of a quantum system s @xmath4 is then crucial to the development of future quantum technologies and experimental investigations of quantum foundations .    </S>",
    "<S> here we report on a systematic experimental study of @xmath3 in one of the most commonly used systems to generate entangled photons : a bulk nonlinear optical crystal generating photon pairs through the process of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , with coupling into single mode optical fibers . </S>",
    "<S> we developed a reconfigurable computer controlled pump - beam and collection - mode optical apparatus which we used to measure the optimized @xmath3 over a range of pump - beam parameters and collection - mode parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the use of low - noise , high - efficiency superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors ( snspds ) in this setup allowed us to explore focus configurations with low overall photon flux to reduce multi - pair events , while still getting reliable measurements of @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measured photon detection rates and @xmath3 agree well with the theoretical treatment of bennink @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrated a correlated - mode coupling efficiency of @xmath5 , which is the highest efficiency yet achieved for this type of system . </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm that very high @xmath3 can be achieved by quantum optical systems  indicating that very high overall heralding efficiencies can , in principle , be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that these results and techniques to optimize @xmath3 will be widely incorporated into photonic systems that benefit from a high heralding efficiency , such as loophole - free bell test systems or heralded single photon sources @xcite . </S>"
