    "the imprecision arises because all the system states have essentially the same values of the state variables , such as ( in thermodynamics ) total internal energy @xmath6 and particle number @xmath7 , and one does not know or care precisely which system state one is dealing with . in field theories with soliton condensates , such as qcd , it also happens that there is a vast number of disordered configurations of about the same action contributing to the unique vacuum state , and it becomes useful , with a slight abuse of notation , to speak of the entropy of the vacuum as a measure of the number of configurations of these disordered states .",
    "qcd , like any many - body system , has entropy at finite temperature , where there are a great many pure states that contribute to the mixed thermal state .",
    "although there are non - trivial problems in evaluating qcd finite - temperature entropy , having to do with infrared singularities and strong coupling , we will not discuss it further except to mention an analogy between thermodynamic entropy and the kinds of zero - temperature qcd entropy of interest to us .",

    "this partition function can also be written as an integral over energy , with an entropic weight factor , yielding the helmholtz free energy : @xmath12 the thermodynamic quantity @xmath6 is the energy @xmath13 at the sharp maximum of the integrand , where @xmath14 .    throughout this paper",

    "it arises even for a pure state as the residual entropy of this pure state when it is entangled between two subsystems a and b , and b ( for example , the interior of a black hole ) is unobserved .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of entanglement entropy is that for many systems , including black holes , entanglement entropy agrees with the holographic principle : it does not scale with the volume of the black hole , but with its horizon area ( as does the bekenstein - hawking entropy ) .",

    "these include frustrated antiferromagnets,@xcite water ice,@xcite and spin ices.@xcite they provide useful analogs to the qcd vacuum even though their idealized ground states are not unique .",
    "disorder at @xmath26 arises because there is no energy cost to move from one realization of the system to another .",
    "for example , in a triangular antiferromagnetic lattice once any two spins in a unit cell are oppositely - aligned , the third spin may be anti - aligned with either , but not both , of the first two with the same energy for either anti - alignment .",
    "spin ices actually have _ ferromagnetic _ interactions obeying the so - called ice rule , calling for two of the four spins in the tetrahedral unit cell to point in , while the other two point out . even at zero temperature",
    "there is no unique way of arranging spins to obey the ice rule , hence disorder and entropy .",
    "it takes an extremely small energy to violate the ice rule ( _ e.g. _ , three in , one out ) in one tetrahedron ; a neighboring tetrahedron then flips a spin to obey the ice rule .",
    "this spin flip propagates along configurations that have disorder greatly resembling that of qcd , with quasi - particle magnetic monopoles and dirac magnetic flux tubes joining them .",
    "ordinarily a flux tube would cost a fair energy per unit length to form , but not for the spin ice .",

    "this can happen when the pure system state is an entangled state of the two subsystems .",

    "we have already calculated the entropy associated with the random positions of these endpoints , which behave for all practical purposes like a gas of point particles on the surface , with the usual vortex areal density @xmath150 , and found a unique minimal - surface area law .",

    "we interpret this bag as region b , with an unobserved chern - simons density .",
    "the volume integral of this density can be expressed as a surface integral that expresses the holographic entanglement entropy .",
    "entanglement entropy from long - range topological disorder is also important in condensed matter physics.@xcite",

    "this is consistent with earlier continuum arguments@xcite that confinement is necessary and sufficient for csb .",
    "there is also lattice evidence that the deconfinement transition temperature is rather close to the csb restoration temperature for quarks .    for decades",

    "note , however , that a recent study@xcite concludes that one - gluon exchange is enough for csb , based on a study of the pinch technique@xcite schwinger - dyson equations based on lattice results and including a gluon mass , which tends to weaken one - gluon effects .      up to now the wilson loops that entered our study of confinement were very large and prescribed beforehand . since they were fixed , they had no entropy at all .",
    "the physical interpretation of such large smooth wilson loops is that they refer to very massive particles , with mass @xmath180 ( @xmath181 is the string tension ) .",
    "such particles can be far apart ( of order @xmath182 ) and hardly feel the confining force .    we now want to study dynamical wilson loops in the opposite limit , of massless quarks that make up the massless goldstone pion , a @xmath183 bound state.@xcite we work in the quenched limit and omit quark determinants in path integrals . in the quenched limit",

    "<S> we review the role of zero - temperature entropy in several closely - related contexts in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the first is entropy associated with disordered condensates , including @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the second is effective vacuum entropy arising from qcd solitons such as center vortices , yielding confinement and chiral symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the third is entanglement entropy , which is entropy associated with a pure state , such as the qcd vacuum , when the state is partially unobserved and unknown . </S>",
    "<S> typically , entanglement entropy of an unobserved 3-volume scales not with the volume but with the area of its bounding surface . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth manifestation of entropy in qcd is the configurational entropy of light - particle world lines and flux tubes ; we argue that this entropy is critical for understanding how confinement produces chiral symmetry breakdown , as manifested by a dynamically - massive quark , a massless pion , and a @xmath1 condensate . </S>"
