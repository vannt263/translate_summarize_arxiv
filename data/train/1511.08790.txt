    "the search for the local interstellar spectrum ( lis ) of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) and a full understanding of the solar modulation are long - standing issues in the field of cosmic rays and heliophysics . in recent years ,",
    "hints of possible dark matter ( dm ) signatures or new astrophysical phenomena have accumulated accumulated as a results of accurate measurements of the anti - matter component in cosmic ray fluxes @xcite . in order to define the astrophysical background of gcrs over which to look for the excess coming from dm annihilation or decay , the knowledge of the lis is of utmost importance .",
    "uncertainties in the low energy part of the lis due to the solar modulation reduce the sensitivity of these type of searches @xcite . with the ever - growing number of satellites orbiting earth and nasa plans for human missions to mars , the characterization of the radiation dose received by astronauts and electronics in different periods of the solar cycle is becoming more and more important : a precise knowledge of the lis and the temporal variation of gcr fluxes inside the heliosphere",
    "is needed for reducing the uncertainties on the estimated dose @xcite .",
    "data collected over many decades from ground observations , balloon experiments and spacecraft have deepened our understanding of how the heliosphere affects the spectrum of gcrs : many numerical models have been developed to solve the parker equation governing the propagation of gcrs in the heliosphere @xcite and to explore the different processes induced by their interactions between the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind .",
    "nevertheless , the force - field approximation @xcite is still routinely used as a reference , due to its simplicity . under the assumptions of spherical symmetry , radial solar wind , an isotropic diffusion coefficient and no particle drift",
    ", the differential gcr flux @xmath0 , measured at earth at the time @xmath1 , is related to the lis @xmath2 via the formula    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the kinetic energy of a nucleus of charge @xmath5 and mass @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is known as the solar modulation parameter or solar modulation potential and has the units of an electric potential .    in august 2012 ,",
    "the voyager 1 spacecraft , launched in 1977 , crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space @xcite .",
    "a debate is still ongoing whether the heliopause can be considered the modulation boundary or not @xcite , but so far the gcr flux measured by voyager 1 has remained steady , thereby suggesting that what is being observed is actually a lis . in 2006 , just before the minimum of solar cycle 23 , the pamela experiment was launched on board a satellite in low earth orbit and since has provided a precise and direct measurement of the top - of - atmosphere proton flux and its time variation up to 50 gev @xcite . the ams-02 experiment was installed in 2011 on the international space station during the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 and recently published the proton flux up to 2 tev , integrated over 3 years , with an error at the @xmath9 level @xcite , which provides the most accurate measurement of the high energy part of the proton lis .",
    "ams-02 is expected to take data until the decommissioning of the iss in 2024 , allowing a precise measurement of the time variation of gcrs throughout an entire solar cycle and of the solar modulation effects on different species of cosmic rays .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a new parametrization for the proton lis based on voyager 1 and ams-02 proton data .",
    "this new lis model , modulated with the force - field approximation , is used to fit the monthly proton fluxes measured by pamela .",
    "we propose a modified version of the force - field approximation with an energy - dependent @xmath10 to better describe pamela data and finally , we compare the extracted @xmath8 with the one derived from neutron monitors ( nms ) .",
    "the majority of the lis models found in literature are based on spacecraft and balloon measurements of gcrs before voyager 1 entered the interstellar space and do not take into account a change of spectral index at high rigidities ( @xmath11 gv ) , which has been observed by pamela @xcite and ams-02 @xcite .",
    "the availability of the high - accuracy high energy proton flux from ams-02 and the low energy proton flux from voyager 1 represent important progress towards the reduction of the uncertainty on the lis shape , enabling a more accurate determination of the solar modulation parameter and improving the understanding of gcr propagation in the heliosphere .",
    "figure [ fig : exp - lis - ratio ] shows the ratio of various proton lis models to the bph00 model used in @xcite to extract the solar modulation parameter from nms , along with the ratio of voyager 1 @xcite and ams-02 @xcite proton fluxes to the same model .",
    "it is clear that the new data from voyager 1 and ams-02 are not well described by these models .",
    "these discrepancies compel us to find a new lis parametrization based on the new results from voyager 1 and ams-02 .            where @xmath13 is the change in spectral index",
    ", @xmath14 is the rigidity where the two power - laws cross each other and @xmath15 determines the smoothness of the change ( @xmath16 means a broken power - law ) .",
    "recently , the analysis of @xmath17-ray emissions from giant molecular clouds point to a low - energy break around 9 gev , with the spectral index changing from @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "we generalize equation [ eqn : power - law - break ] to describe two power - law breaks :      where the indices 1 and 2 stand for the low- and high - rigidity break respectively : if @xmath21 , equation [ eqn : two - power - law - break ] reduces to @xmath22 ; if @xmath23 , equation [ eqn : two - power - law - break ] becomes @xmath24 ; and if @xmath25 , equation [ eqn : two - power - law - break ] goes as @xmath26 .    to describe the energy range spanned by the voyager 1 data , we note that if we divide the voyager 1 proton flux by a generic power law , as shown in figure [ fig : gtf ] , the resulting ratio looks like a sigmoid function in @xmath27 ; we assume the following parametrization to describe this ratio :            @xmath33^{-1/\\nu } r^{\\gamma_{1 } } \\\\[2em ]        \\times \\left\\ { 1 + \\left [ \\dfrac{r}{r_{b1 } } \\left ( 1 + \\left ( \\dfrac{r}{r_{b2 } } \\right)^{\\delta\\gamma_{2}/s_{2 } } \\right)^{s_{2}}\\right]^{\\delta\\gamma_{1}/s_{1 } } \\right\\}^{s_{1 } }     \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the available data in the rigidity range between up to a few tens of gv are all affected by the solar modulation , therefore a simple fit of equation [ eqn : lis ] to voyager 1 data and ams-02 data above 100 gv ( to remove any residual modulation ) is not able to correctly constrain all the parameters , especially @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . to resolve this issue",
    ", we proceed by simultaneously fitting voyager 1 data with equation [ eqn : lis ] and ams-02 data with equation [ eqn : lis ] modulated with the force - field approximation ; this way , we obtain at the same time the parameters for the lis and the average solar modulation parameter throughout the ams-02 data time period .",
    "the least - squares fit is done with ` minuit ` @xcite , minimizing the following quantity :      where @xmath40 is the binning index , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the bin edges and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are respectively the data and its associated error in the @xmath40-th bin and @xmath46 is defined as in equation [ eqn : ffa ] after converting from kinetic energy to rigidity .",
    "( solid line ) and ams-02 data ( black square ) with @xmath48 ( dashed - dotted line ) , as described in the text ; the shaded bands represent the 1 , 2 and 3 @xmath30 confidence intervals around the best fit .",
    "data and fit are rescaled by @xmath49 : see @xcite for the definition of @xmath50 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the fit residuals along with the confidence intervals .",
    "a color version of this figure is available in the online journal.,scaledwidth=47.5% ]    voyager 1 errors are only statistical , so they over - constrain the lis parameters ; the residuals above @xmath51 in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : lis - mod - fit - ffa ] occur in the energy range where voyager 1 changes its energy measurement method .",
    "the fitted parameters are presented in table [ tab : ffa - fit - pars ] ."
