    "only the periodic intensity modulation is observed , without any systematic change of subpulse phase . on the other hand ,",

    "although the original idea of rs75 associating the rotating sub - beams with the circulating sparks is still regarded as the best model of drifting subpulse phenomenon , their vacuum gap was later demonstrated to suffer from the so - called binding energy problem ( for review see * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , the cohesive energies of @xmath3fe ions used by rs75 proved largely overestimated and the inner vacuum gap envisioned by rs75 was impossible to form",
    ". however , it is worth emphasizing that rs75 considered the canonical surface dipolar magnetic fields with values determined from the pulsar spindown rate , although they implicitly assumed small radii of curvature @xmath8  cm required by the pair creation conditions , which is inconsistent with a purely dipolar field .",
    "recently gil & mitra ( 2001 ; hereafter gm01 ) revisited the binding energy problem an found that the formation of a vacuum gap is in principle possible , although it requires an extremely strong non - dipolar surface magnetic field @xmath9 , where the coefficient @xmath10 in a typical pulsar , @xmath11  g is the dipolar field at the pole , @xmath12 is the pulsar period in seconds , @xmath13 is the period derivative and @xmath14 .    in a superstrong surface magnetic field @xmath15 , where @xmath16  g , the asymptotic approximation of @xcite used by rs75 in derivation of the height of quasi steady vacuum gap is no longer valid .",

    "they considered two kinds of high energy seed photons dominating the @xmath26 pair production : the curvature radiation ( cr ) photons with energy @xmath27 ( rs75 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and resonant inverse compton scattering ( ics ) photons with energy @xmath28 @xcite , where @xmath29 is a typical lorentz factor of particles within the gap .",
    "the corresponding vacuum gap is called the curvature radiation dominated ( cr - ntvg ) and the inverse compton scattering dominated ( ics - ntvg ) , respectively .",
    "gm01 estimated the characteristic heights of both cr - ntvg and ics - ntvg . in this paper",
    "we further refine these estimates by including the general relativistic ( gr ) effects of inertial frame dragging ( ifd ) and considering the heat flow conditions within the thin uppermost surface layer of the polar cap .",

    "the obtained vg models are applied to pulsars with drifting subpulses and/or periodic intensity modulations , in which the presence of @xmath30 drifting spark discharges seems almost unavoidable ( deshpande & rankin 1999 , 2001 ; vivekanand & joshi 1999 , and gil & sendyk 2000 ) .",

    "@xcite pointed out that gr effect of ifd @xcite should affect the rs75 type models with a vacuum gap above the polar cap .",
    "although @xcite did not investigate the problem , they implicitly suggested that the electric fields distorted by gr effects make formation of `` starved '' inner magnetospheric regions even more difficult than in the flat space case .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that although gr - ifd effect is small , it nevertheless slightly helps formation of vg above the polar caps .",
    "in other words , gr modified potential drop within vg is slightly lower than in the flat space case .",
    "below we confirm this finding for ntvg conditions , with a very strong and complicated surface magnetic field .",
    "the gap electric field @xmath32 along @xmath33 results from a deviation of the local charge density @xmath34 from the corotational charge density @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the flat space - time goldreich - julian ( 1969 ) charge density , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the redshift factor , @xmath41 is the gravitational radius , @xmath42 is the neutron star mass and @xmath43 is the neutron star moment of inertia .",

    "cr - ntvg is also possible , although it requires a relatively low cohesive energies , as well as an extremely strong ( @xmath106 ) and/or curved ( @xmath107 ) surface magnetic field at the polar cap .",
    "there is a growing evidence that the radio emission of pulsars with systematically drifting subpulses ( grazing cuts of the line - of - sight ) or periodic intensity modulations ( central cuts of the line - of - sight ) is based on the inner vacuum gap developed just above the polar cap @xcite . to overcome the binding energy problem @xcite put forward an attractive but exotic conjecture that pulsars showing the drifting subpulses represent bare polar cap strange stars ( bpcss ) rather than neutron stars",

    "it is worth noting that ics discussed in this paper is the so - called `` resonant '' scattering .",
    "the choice of this mode of ics is justified by the superstrong magnetic fields relevant for the near - threshold regime .",
    "however , it is clear that the thermal photons also contribute some pair - producing gamma - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this process can not dominate the breakdown of the gap , since it requires higher surface temperatures , which may inhibit the formation of vg in the first place .",
    "one can only speculate that the dominating thermal ics mode is associated with the pulse nulling phenomenon .",
    "these issues require further investigation .",
    "the pulsars with drifting subpulses and/or periodic intensity modulation do not seem to occupy any particular region of the @xmath73 diagram ( see fig .  1 in gm01 ) .",
    "rather , they are spread uniformly all over the @xmath73 space , at least for typical pulsars ( excluding young and millisecond pulsars , in which observations of single pulses are difficult in the first place ) .",
    "therefore , it seems tempting to propose that radio emission of all pulsars should be driven by vacuum gap activities .",
    "an attractive property of such proposition is that the nonstationary sparking discharges induce the two - stream instabilities that develop at relatively low altitudes @xcite where the pulsars radio emission is expected to originate @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the high frequency plasma waves generated by the two - stream instabilities can be converted into coherent electromagnetic radiation at pulsar radio wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ [ tauics ] ] ) of the ratio @xmath207 as a function of @xmath208 ( see section 2.3 and fig . 1 for explanation ) , for different values of @xmath203 and @xmath140 ( for the clarity of presentation we adopted @xmath190 and @xmath89 ) . as one can see from this figure , the characteristic spark development time scales of cr- and ics- induced discharges are comparable . this is a consequence of the fact that the stronger the magnetic field the smaller the @xmath79 for ics , thus the larger the pair - production multiplicity and the smaller the spark development time scale @xmath209 .",
    "we can thus generally state that in the near - threshold regime ics - driven spark avalanche looks very similar to the conventional rs75 cr - driven avalanche .",

    "<S> the problem of formation of the ruderman - sutherland type inner vacuum gap in neutron stars with @xmath0 is considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued by means of the condition @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the critical temperature above which @xmath3fe ions will not be bound at the surface and @xmath4 is the actual temperature of the polar cap surface heated by the back - flow of relativistic electrons ) that the inner vacuum gap can form , provided that the actual surface magnetic field is extremaly strong ( @xmath5  g ) and curved ( @xmath6  cm ) , irrespective of the value of dipolar component measured from the pulsar spin down rate . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are carried out for pulsars with drifting subpulses and/or periodic intensity modulations , in which the existence of the quasi steady vacuum gap discharging via @xmath7 drifting sparks is almost unavoidable . using different pair - production mechanisms and different estimates of the cohesive energies of surface iron ions , </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is easier to form the vacuum gap controlled by the resonant inverse compton scaterring seed photons than by the curvature radiation seed photons . </S>"
