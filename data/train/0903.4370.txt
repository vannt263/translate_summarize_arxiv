    "our main tool will be classical monte carlo simulation , but where the standard local update metropolis algorithm is augmented by a parallel tempering scheme @xcite , which greatly improves the ergodicity of the method .",
    "simulation results will also be compared with simple mean field theories and classical spinwave calculations .",
    "one concept that will be used throughout this work is the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) , @xmath2 , the rate of change of temperature of the system with applied magnetic field at constant entropy .",
    "this quantity is useful as a tool for identifying phase transitions in both simulation and experiment , and forms the basis for magnetic refrigeration .",
    "the first model we consider is the heisenberg model on a square lattice with additional ( @xmath4 ) bonds @xmath5    despite its apparent simplicity , this is a very interesting model , and is thought to describe two new classes of oxide compounds  @xcite .",
    "the classical phase diagram in zero field is shown in fig .  [ j1j2phase ] . the quantum phase diagram and finite field properties of the spin-@xmath6 quantum model have been extensively investigated for both antiferromagnetic ( af )  @xcite and ferromagnetic ( fm )  @xcite @xmath3 .",
