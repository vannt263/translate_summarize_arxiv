    "in the last few years , braneworld model@xcite has become a fundamental paradigm of modern cosmology .",
    "one of the most used scenario is the _ randall - syndrum _",
    "type-2 model@xcite . in this theory , _ _",
    "_ _ our four - dimensional universe is considered as a @xmath2-brane embedded in five - dimensional anti - de sitter space - time ( @xmath3 ) , while gravity can be propagated in the bulk .",
    "the main characteristic feature of this model is that the _ friedmann _ equation is modified by an additional term proportional to quadratic energy density@xcite .",
    "braneworld inflation , was mainly shown to play a fondamental  role in divers cosmological investigations of early universe and has been proposed to solve some problems of actual cosmological observations like as dark energydarkenergy , tachyonic inflation@xcite or black holes systemsbhrs . recently",
    ", some generalized potentials and supersymmetic versions were studied in the framework of _ randall - syndrum _ model and a best fit to recent observations was given@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider various types of potential models , in particular the exponential , monomial and inverse power law .",
    "we have analyzed in some details divers perturbation parameter spectrum and show that the monomial potential provides the best fit results to more recent wmap7 data .    in sec.2 , we begin by recalling the foundation of the braneworld inflation .",
    "we have adopted here the slow - roll approximation and have considered the high energy limit to derive various inflation observables . in sec.3 , we present our work concerning a different models of potential in the framework of the _ randall - syndrum _ type 2 model and give a comparative study of a exponential , monomial and inverse power law potentials . in the last section ,",
    "a conclusion and perspectives are given .",
    "in this section , we start by recalling briefly some fundamentals of _ randall - sundrum _ type-@xmath0 model . one of the most relevant consequences of this model is the modification of the _ friedmann _ equation for energy density of the order of the brane tension , and also the appearance of an additional term , usually considered as dark radiation term .",
    "in the case where the dark radiation term is neglected , the gravitational _ einstein _",
    "equations , leads to the modified _",
    "equation on the brane as@xcite@xmath4 , \\]]where @xmath5 is the _ hubble _",
    "parameter , @xmath6 is the energy density , @xmath7 is the brane tension and @xmath8 is the _",
    "planck _ mass .",
    "note that the crucial correction to standard inflation is given by the density quadratic term @xmath9 .",
    "note also that in the limit @xmath10 we recover standard four - dimensional general relativistic results .",
    "moreover , in the high energy limit i.e. @xmath11 the dynamic of the universe in @xmath12 dimensions will be governed by the simplest equation given by@xmath13on the other hand , the matter in @xmath2-brane is dominated by a scalar field with energy density of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scalar field potential responsible of inflation .    along with these equations ,",
    "one also has a second inflation _",
    "equation governing the dynamic of the scalar field as@xmath16where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19    this is a second - order evolution equation which follows from conservation condition of energy ",
    "momentum tensor @xmath20 . to calculate some physical quantities as scale factor or perturbation spectrum",
    ", one has to solve eqs.(1,3 ) for some specific potentials @xmath15 .",
    "to do so , the slow - roll approximation was introduced and applied by many authors to derive perturbation spectrum of inflation@xcite . in this work",
    ", we apply slow - roll approximation ( @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 ) and we use the well known slow - roll parameters@xcite , to calculate perturbation spectrum .",
    "@xmath25where @xmath26 we signal that , during inflation we have the following conditions@xmath27the small quantum fluctuations in the scalar field lead to fluctuations in the energy density which was studied in a perturbative theory@xcite .",
    "as discussed in@xcite quantum fluctuations effect of the inflaton are generally negligibles , since the coupling of the scalar field to bulk gravitational fluctuations only modifies the usual 4d predictions at the next order in the slow - roll expansion .",
    "so , one can define the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations as@xmath28where @xmath29 is the wave number .    in relation to @xmath30 ,",
    "the scalar spectral index is defined as@xcite @xmath31on the other hand , the quantum fluctuations in the scalar field lead also to fluctuations in the metric . in this way",
    ", one can define the amplitude of tensor perturbations as@xcite@xmath32where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that in the high - energy limit ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath36    these results lead to the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations @xmath37 @xmath38as function of @xmath39 , the inflation parameter @xmath37 become@xmath40other perturbation quantity is the running of the scalar index @xmath41 which is given in terms of @xmath22 as@xmath42where @xmath43    another important caracteristic inflationary parameter is the number of e - folding @xmath44 defined by@xcite@xmath45where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the values of the scalar field at the epoch when the cosmological scales exit the horizon and at the end of inflation , respectively .    in the next section , we give our results concerning a three potential models and present the evolution of various inflationary perturbation spectrum according to different potential parameters .",
    "the exponential potentiel was studied in various occasions , for example the authors in ref.@xcite have shown that inflation becomes possible in braneworld model for a class of potentials ordinarily too steep to sustain accelerated expansion .",
    "they have also shown that this potentiel allows a particularly natural implementation of reheating via gravitational particle production .    here",
    "we consider an exponential potential of  following type@xmath48where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constants .    for this type of potential ,",
    "the scalar spectral index @xmath51 and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations @xmath37 take respectively the following expressions@xmath52the running of the scalar index is presented by@xmath53inflation ends when @xmath54 , the equation @xmath55 leads to@xmath56taking into account the equation@xmath57(13 ) , the value of the potential when the cosmological scales exit the horizon is @xmath58 in terms of @xmath44 the inflation parameters become@xmath59by using the equations ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) and wmap7 observations data@xcite,@xmath60we can show that @xmath61 thus , we can deduce an upper limit for the e - folding number without running .    the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations is given by@xmath62the observed value for @xmath63 from wmap7 is @xmath64according to eq.(26 ) , the condition @xmath65 implies that@xmath66which constitutes the necessary and sufficient condition on the brane tension with respect to parameter @xmath50 so that the exponential potential can describe the early inflation of the universe .",
    "the exponential potential was recently introduced to describe tachyonic inflation , but in standard inflation this potential can not reproduce many phenomena such dissipation . the chaotic potential and it s generalisation@xcite , can occur for field values , when the cosmological scales exit the horizon @xmath46 , below the four - dimensional @xmath67 scale i.e. @xmath68 . in ref.@xcite , we have studied a more genaralized version of this potential in branewold model , and shown that the observation bound are satisfied . on the other hand , liddle et al.liddle have shown that observational constraints can be respected for an monomial potential , in particular for @xmath69 . here , we are interested on studing the variation of various inflationary parameters , in braneworld scenario , as function of @xmath70 for divers e - folding number values .    in this work",
    "we consider a potential of the form@xmath71where @xmath70 is constant and @xmath72 is a parameter of dimension @xmath73 ^{4-n}.$ ]    for this type of potential , the scalar spectral index @xmath51 and the ratio @xmath37 are respectively given by@xmath74the running of the scalar index is presented by@xmath75to express the previous parameters of inflation only in terms of  the e - folding number @xmath44 and the exponent @xmath70 , it is convenient to calculate the values of @xmath47 and @xmath46 using eq.(13)@xmath76the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations is given by@xmath77eqs.(26 , 34 ) imply that@xmath78this is the condition for the brane tension according only to power spectrum of the curvature perturbations observational value for a relevant @xmath72 energy scale of the potential .",
    "for a complete study , it s necessary to check the other inflationary parameters .",
    "according to eq.(33 ) , the inflationary observables become @xmath79note that when @xmath80  the inflation parameters @xmath51 , @xmath37 and @xmath81 reduce to expressions of exponential * *  * * potential case(eqs . 20 , 21 , 22 ) . in the following , we plot these observables as functions of @xmath70.the fig.1 shows that there exist a significant region of variation of @xmath51 according to @xmath70 , where the results are consistent with observations , in particuler for large values of @xmath44 and small values of @xmath70 . for large values of @xmath70 ,",
    "the scalar spectral index becomes in disagreement with @xmath82 data except for very large @xmath44 .",
    "in that case , we recover the results obtained in the case of the exponential potential ( eq.14 ) .    in particular , for @xmath69 which corresponds to chaotic case",
    ", the observational constraints for @xmath51 require that @xmath83 , eq.(35 ) reduces then to@xmath84 in this case , the fig.2 shows that we can recover the observational results for large range of variation of exponent @xmath70 provided that @xmath44 be large.in fig.3 , we have ploted the variation of @xmath81 according to @xmath70 .",
    "we see that the values of the e - folding number @xmath44 compatibles with @xmath82 data , the running of the scalar index is small and negative .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the spectral scalar index @xmath51 is scale invariant .",
    "this phenomena was already predicts by inflation theory ( harrison - zeldovich invariant)@xcite .",
    "the inverse power law potential ( @xmath85 has been studied in various context , specially , for modelisation of quintessence matter on the braneworld inflation@xcite where it was shown that inflation occurs only for @xmath86 . this potential was also studied in tachyonic inflation model@xcite .",
    "it have been shown that if the tachyon dominates the background dynamics , then it will either go into a dust - dominated phase ( @xmath86 ) , power - law expansion for @xmath87 , or quasi de - sitter accelerated expansion for @xmath88 .",
    "we consider the following inverse power law potential@xcite@xmath89@xmath90 is a parameter of dimension @xmath73 ^{4+m}.$ ]    for this type of potential , the scalar spectral index and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations take respectively the following expressions@xmath91the running of the scalar spectral index is presented by@xmath92as above , we evaluate either the values of @xmath47 and @xmath46 using eq.(13 ) @xmath93the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations is given by@xmath94eqs.(26 , 46 ) imply that@xmath95as for the previous models , eq.(47 ) shows the condition for the brane tension according to power spectrum of the curvature perturbations observational value for a relevant @xmath90 energy scale of the potential . to complete our study , we analyse the variations of all other inflationary parameters with respect to @xmath96 .",
    "so , in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath96 , the inflationary parameters become@xmath97note that when @xmath98  the inflation parameters @xmath51 , @xmath37 and @xmath81 reduce to expressions of exponential * *  * * potential case(eqs . 20 , 21 , 22 ) . in the following , we plot these observables as functions of @xmath70 .",
    "fig.4 shows the variation of @xmath51 as function of @xmath99 we observe that , in order to confront @xmath51 with wmap7 data we must have very large value of @xmath44 .",
    "this result is compatible with the exponential potential case.this figure which presents @xmath37 as function of @xmath96 , confirme our above results concerning the very large values of e - folding number @xmath44 as condition of inflation .    in particular",
    ", for @xmath100 , the observational constraints for @xmath51 and @xmath37 require that @xmath101 then , for @xmath100 and @xmath102 , eq.(47 ) reduces to@xmath103it s clear , as shown in fig.6 , that the running of the scalar index @xmath81 becomes negligible for very large @xmath44 , as predicted by wmap7 observations .",
    "we present in this subsection a summary concerning the different inflationary parameters for the three types of potential at @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this table shows that , for @xmath104 and @xmath106 all inflationary parameters depend only on the e - folding number @xmath44 and exponents of the scalar fields for the two first potentials . note that",
    "for large @xmath70 and @xmath96 , the monomial and inverse power law potentials lead to similar results in the exponential potential case .",
