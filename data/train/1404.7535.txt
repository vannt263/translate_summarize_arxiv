    "<S> we describe simple quantum - mechanical approach to calculating equilibrium particle current along the edge of a system with non - trivial band spectrum topology . </S>",
    "<S> the approach does not require any _ a priori _ knowledge of the band topology and , as a matter of fact , treats topological and non - topological contributions to the edge currents on the same footing . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate its usefulness by demonstrating the existence of ` topologically non - trivial ' particle currents along the edges of three different physical systems : two - dimensional electron gas with spin - orbit coupling and zeeman magnetic field , surface state of a topological insulator , and kagom antiferromagnet with dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we describe relation of our results to the notion of orbital magnetization . </S>"
