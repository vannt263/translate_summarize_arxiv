    "in addition of quantum monte carlo @xcite and exact diagonalization @xcite , the method of tensor networks @xcite is one of the powerful theoretical tools to study strongly correlated many - body systems .",
    "tensor network algorithms are based on the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "dmrg has proven to be a great success in the simulation of strongly correlated one - dimensional quantum lattice systems .",
    "the method of tensor network states has become popular after we found that the internal structure of dmrg can be understood with respect to the matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite . for two - dimensional systems , the projected entangled - pair states ( peps )",
    "@xcite are introduced . more generally , there are many tensor network states ( tns ) , which include mps , peps , tree tensor network states @xcite , the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite , matrix - product projected states @xcite , and projected entangled simplex states ( pess ) @xcite .",
    "these tensor network states are used as the basis set for variational approaches to quantum many - body systems .    when a total hamiltonian is written as a sum of local hamiltonians ,",
    "vidal introduced a powerful method called time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) @xcite to find the ground state .",
    "if the total hamiltonian has a symmetry such as translational invariance , we can use the so - called infinite tebd ( itebd ) @xcite , in which we assume that the tensors in the tns have the same form , and we update a few tensors to achieve the ground state .",
    "entanglement is a truly quantum mechanical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "one of the recent interests in theoretical condensed matter physics is to understand entanglement @xcite in strongly correlated quantum many - body systems .",
    "in fact , the entanglement entropy is used to characterize quantum phases @xcite . to define the entanglement entropy",
    ", we divide the quantum system into two parts @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce a density matrix @xmath2 with a pure quantum state @xmath3 for the whole system , and obtain the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath0 such as @xmath4 by tracing out subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "the entanglement entropy is the von neumann entropy , which is given by @xmath5 . in particular , for @xmath6-dimensional quantum systems , the half - chain entanglement entropy @xcite is defined by using the schmidt coefficients .",
    "the entanglement entropy for a finite block of a @xmath6-dimensional critical system was calculated analytically by using conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find the half - chain entanglement entropy in the one - dimensional spinless fermion model .",
    "to do so , we start by using the ansatz of matrix product state for the ground state in the model",
    ". we present a slightly modified method in determining the ground state energy by normalizing the maximum schmidt coefficient @xcite .",
    "we apply our method to the one - dimensional spinless fermion model .",
    "we also find the finite bond dimension scaling of the half - chain entanglement entropy .",
    "the scaling behavior is consistent with the formula of the entanglement entropy given by calabrese and cardy @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , a brief description of our method is given , and we present the role of the maximum schmidt coefficient in determining the ground state energy . in sec .",
    "3 , by using itebd , we calculate the ground state for the one - dimensional spinless fermion model . in sec . 4",
    ", we present the numerical results , which are the half - chain entanglement entropy , and the corresponding data collapse .",
    "we find that the entanglement entropy shows abrupt changes on the boundary of phases . in conclusion ,",
    "we discuss the future goal of simulating the two - dimensional fermion model , where we encounter notorious difficulties in relation with the negative sign problem .",
    "we briefly review the method @xcite that we use here for completeness .",
    "there are two methods to obtain the ground state in tensor network algorithms .",
    "one is the variational method , in which we minimize the energy expectation value by changing parameters in the ansatz .",
    "the other is the imaginary time evolving , which produces the ground state energy by applying an operator on a tensor network state consecutively .",
    "the imaginary time evolving method is adopted here to find the ground state .",
    "the imaginary time evolving method starts by considering the formal solution @xmath7 to the imaginary time schrdinger equation , which is written as @xmath8 where we introduce an energy shift @xmath9 for a given hamiltonian @xmath10 , and we will perform the suzuki - trotter decomposition for @xmath11 , where the trotter time step @xmath12 should be sufficiently small . as the imaginary time @xmath13 goes to infinity ,",
    "the state @xmath14 becomes the ground state for properly chosen @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath9 is larger or smaller than the ground - state energy , @xmath15 blows up or shrinks down , respectively , in the limit as @xmath16 . in a numerical approach , we redefine @xmath9 as a function of @xmath13 to maintain the norm of state .    for one - dimensional systems ,",
    "our ansatz for the ground state is a mps because of the area law @xcite .",
    "a tensor in mps , @xmath17 , has three indices , among which the physical index @xmath18 takes a value from @xmath19 to @xmath20 . for the internal bond degree of freedom ,",
    "the indices @xmath21 ( left ) and @xmath22 ( right ) run from @xmath19 to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the bond dimension .",
    "the schmidt coefficients between @xmath17 and @xmath25 are denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "a state in the space of the matrix product states is written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 means that all internal bond indices @xmath29 are summed up .",
    "vidal proposed a clever idea of tebd for updating the tensors in the mps of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mps ] ) .",
    "usually a local hamiltonian is written as a sum of the elementary operators @xmath30 such as @xmath31 , where the index of @xmath32 and @xmath33 represents nearby sites .",
    "then , by the suzuki - trotter decomposition , it is enough to consider the effect of @xmath34 . when @xmath34 acts on the previous mps , we approximate the output state into our new mps by updating the tensors and the schmidt coefficients locally .",
    "in fact , the first step in tebd is to find the four - index tensor @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 for example , in order to update @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath37 in @xmath38 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mps ] ) , we consider the four - index tensor @xmath39 : @xmath40 by employing singular value decompositions ( svd ) , we obtain the updated @xmath41 by keeping the @xmath24 largest weights : @xmath42 by dividing and attaching the weights , we find @xmath43 and @xmath44 from @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the above .",
    "we denote this process graphically as follows : @xmath47 where the vertical lines mean the physical indices .",
    "a similar procedure is performed for other tensors @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and other weights on the bonds .",
    "we note that it is possible to update the tensors simultaneously if we use multi - core computers .",
    "if there is a translational symmetry in the local hamiltonian , we use itebd , where we assume that only two matrices @xmath0 and @xmath1 repeat in the mps . in this case",
    ", we need to update @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath37 , and @xmath51 only .",
    "now we present how to determine the ground state energy without evaluations of inner products @xcite .",
    "being inspired by the diffusion monte carlo @xcite , we have introduced the energy @xmath9 in front of the operator of the suzuki - trotter decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmcsolution ] ) .",
    "while the energy is adjusted by controlling the number of replicas in the diffusion monte carlo , here we determine @xmath9 by managing the factor in front of the wave function @xcite .",
    "the algorithm is as follows : when a typical operator @xmath34 acts on a matrix product state @xmath52 , we perform svd and obtain @xmath24 singular values of @xmath53 .",
    "we take out the maximum @xmath54 and place it in front of the wave function , and we modify the singular values as follows : @xmath55 . in this way , we normalize @xmath38 such that all weights on each bond have the maximum value of 1 . thus , whenever the weights are modified by @xmath11 acting on the @xmath56-th time step state @xmath57 , we take out the maximum weight to obtain the factor @xmath58 in front of the state @xmath59 where the maximum schmidt coefficient on each bond in @xmath60 is equal to @xmath61 .",
    "we obtain the factor @xmath58 by multiplying the previous @xmath58 by @xmath54 whenever any bond is modified . because we require no divergence and no convergence to zero for the state , as in the diffusion monte carlo , we adjust the next energy value @xmath62 for the state to be stable in this way : @xmath63 after we find @xmath62 , we set @xmath64 again for the next iteration in the computer simulation .",
    "we note that during the time evolution , @xmath65 is stable and approaches the ground - state energy in the limit of @xmath66 .",
    "the solution of @xmath67 is also stable .",
    "in relation with the luttinger liquids , the spinless fermion model may be the simplest fermion system , which is a good laboratory for a benchmark calculation @xcite .",
    "we begin by presenting the hamiltonian for the one - dimensional spinless fermion model : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the nearest - neighbor hopping strength in a one - dimensional lattice , @xmath70 is the nearby coulomb interaction strength , and @xmath71 is the number operator .",
    "the role of the chemical potential @xmath72 is to control the number of fermions in the system .",
    "because this one - dimensional spinless fermion model preserves the translational invariance , we can use itebd here .",
    "when we apply itebd to find the ground state , we divide the hamiltonian into two parts , which are denoted by @xmath73(even ) and @xmath74(odd ) , such as @xmath75 for the suzuki - trotter decomposition .",
    "the elementary operators @xmath76 are written as @xmath77 in order to find the ground state , we consider a tiny corner of the hilbert space .",
    "the tiny corner is characterized by the mps with two tensors and two vectors with a fixed bond dimension @xmath24 .",
    "it is natural to define the physical index @xmath78 in the mps for the spinless fermion model .",
    "the state on the @xmath32-th site is represented by @xmath79 or @xmath61 , such as @xmath19 for the vacancy and @xmath61 for the occupancy .",
    "the state of the fock space is written in terms of the creation operators @xmath80 as follows : @xmath81    now we apply itebd in order to obtain the ground state of the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) . in the process of itebd",
    ", we need to determine @xmath82 .",
    "we first calculate the @xmath83 matrix @xmath84 , which is written as @xmath85 by using the taylor expansion , the four - index tensor @xmath35 of @xmath82 is written in terms of @xmath86 .",
    "we obtain the values of @xmath35 numerically for given @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath72 , and @xmath12 . for a small @xmath12 ,",
    "it is enough to make the taylor expansion up to @xmath87 .    performing itebd with the mps",
    ", we use two matrices @xmath0 , @xmath1 and two schmidt coefficients @xmath37 , @xmath51 .",
    "our goal is to find @xmath38 for the ground state by optimizing @xmath0 and @xmath1 in itebd .",
    "we describe the procedure for the computational simulation of itebd from the suzuki - trotter decomposition with @xmath88 :    1 .",
    "choose @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath37 , and @xmath51 randomly .",
    "update @xmath0 , @xmath37 , and @xmath1 , by handling @xmath89 .",
    "update @xmath1 , @xmath51 , and @xmath0 , by handling @xmath90 .",
    "repeat from step 2 until @xmath37 and @xmath51 are identical .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : de ] ) , we note that the corresponding energy per site @xmath73 is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the maximum singular values obtained by performing svd . as a benchmark calculation",
    ", we present the ground state energy per site for the model as shown in fig [ fig : gse ] .",
    "when we find the ground state as a form of mps , the advantage of mps is easily to extract the half - chain entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "we present the von neumann entropy for the half - infinite chain by using the schmidt coefficients : @xmath94 we note that we do not have to distinguish @xmath95 from @xmath96 in @xmath67 because we simulate until they become equal . by simulation with",
    "randomly chosen initial states for the model , we repeatedly find two ground states whose energy difference is invisible , in fact , less than @xmath97 .",
    "thus , it is hard to distinguish two states by energy .",
    "however , two states prominently have different entanglement entropies .",
    "we show two kinds of the corresponding half - chain entanglement entropy @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sh28 ] for the bond dimension @xmath99 .",
    "the shapes of entropy are similar , but the values are quite different from each other .    focusing on the less entangled state which is lower in fig . [",
    "fig : sh28 ] , we present the half - chain entanglement entropy for several internal bond dimensions @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sh ] . we find the abrupt changes @xcite near @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "for @xmath102 , the entanglement entropy becomes saturated , in other words , the entropy does not depend on @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that the corresponding hamiltonian is gapful . on the other hand , for @xmath103 , as @xmath24 increases",
    ", the entropy also increases .",
    "this @xmath24-dependence is the signal of criticality or gapless .",
    "it is remarkable that the entanglement entropy for a critical system can be obtained by means of conformal field theory . for the case where the whole one - dimensional system has a finite but large length @xmath104 with the periodic boundary condition and",
    "the subsystem is a single interval of length @xmath105 , the entanglement entropy @xcite is given by @xmath106 where @xmath21 is the lattice spacing , @xmath107 is a non - universal constant , and @xmath108 is the central charge .    because there is only one side contact for the half - chain , we should modify the above formula for the half - chain entanglement entropy by dividing 2 and setting @xmath109 such as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a non - universal constant .",
    "the length of the system size @xmath104 is related to the correlation length @xmath112 near a critical point such as @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , it is postulated that the correlation length @xmath112 has the scaling relation with the bond dimension @xmath24 such as @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "then , we find @xmath115 using this formula , it is of interest to check the finite @xmath24 scaling of @xmath98 .",
    "we find the data collapse in the plot of @xmath116 versus @xmath70 by adjusting @xmath117 as shown in fig [ fig : es ] .",
    "the data collapse happens between @xmath101 and @xmath118 , which is consistent with the previous results about the critical region .",
    "finally , we determine the scaling exponent @xmath119 from the data collapse of fig [ fig : es ] , for instance , @xmath120 at @xmath118 with the well - known result of @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have presented the half - chain entanglement entropy for the spinless fermion model .",
    "we perform the finite bond dimension scaling with the entanglement entropy .",
    "we find the critical behavior between @xmath101 and @xmath118 , which is consistent with the previous results .",
    "when we use multi - core computers , it is possible to parallelize the local updates of the internal bonds for the model of no translational symmetry . as a future work , we hope that someone will perform this parallel computing soon .",
    "it is of interest to extend our method to two - dimensional systems .",
    "although we do not encounter the notorious sign problem here , we have to overcome the sign problem in the two - dimensional model with peps .",
