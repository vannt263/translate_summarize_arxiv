    "large - scale surveys of our galaxy are underway and in 2013 the european space agency will launch a satellite , gaia , that is tasked with determining astrometry and photometry of unprecedented precision for a billion stars and gathering the spectra of a hundred million stars .",
    "the large outlays required to gather these data have been motivated by the expectation that we will be able to infer from the data not only the distribution of the galaxy s dark matter , but also quite detailed knowledge of the manner of its formation and its evolutionary history .",
    "dynamical models of the galaxy will be central to achieving these goals .",
    "the simplest plausible dynamical models approximate the galaxy by an axisymmetric body and exploit jeans theorem to make the distribution function ( ) dependent on just three isolating integrals .",
    "there are substantial advantages in identifying these integrals with the actions @xmath6 , which quantifies a star s radial oscillations , @xmath7 , which quantifies oscillations perpendicular to the galaxy s equatorial plane , and @xmath8 , the component of angular momentum about the assumed symmetry axis .",
    "it turns out that good fits to the available observational data can be obtained with models whose s are simple analytic functions of the actions ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b10 ) .",
    "given such a , the calculation of predictions that can be compared with data is greatly facilitated if it is easy to determine the actions @xmath9 of a given phase - space point @xmath10 .",
    "analytic expressions for @xmath11 are not available for any realistic galactic potential and one has to have recourse to approximate and numerical methods . in b10 and @xcite the observable properties of models",
    "were obtained from the ` adiabatic approximation ' for actions . in a companion paper",
    "we show that an algorithm based on the proximity of galactic potentials to stckel potentials yields more accurate estimates of actions for a wider class of orbits .",
    "moreover , this algorithm can be implemented in a sufficiently streamlined way that the observables of @xmath12 models can be estimated per hour on a laptop , and it becomes relatively straightforward to search the space of possible s automatically rather than by hand , and heavily influenced by prior prejudice , as was done in b10 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present results obtained by such automatic searches .",
    "our aim is to explore the extent to which the global structure of the galaxy can be pinned down by restricted sets of data when we impose a particular functional form for the .",
    "the data we consider are restricted to the solar cylinder and for the most part quite old , so the models we obtain are far from definitive .",
    "surveys now in hand will shortly yield data with much better statistics that extend significantly beyond the solar cylinder , so now is not the time to seek definitive results .",
    "rather it is the moment to explore possibilities and connections between different types of data , and these are the tasks addressed in this paper .",
    "section [ sec : pots ] we describes the adopted potentials and section [ sec : dfs ] gives the functional forms of the adopted distribution functions .",
    "section [ sec : models ] shows fits obtained to observational data using two potentials , which differ in the assumed values of the distance @xmath13 to the galactic centre and the local circular speed @xmath14 .",
    "section [ sec : discuss ] demonstrates that the thick disc has to be hotter vertically than radially , and addresses a variety of issues that are raised by the models .",
    "section [ sec : conclude ] sums up and considers what should be done next in relation to both surveys of our galaxy and of external galaxies .",
    "an appendix explains how we evaluate the multiple integrals over velocity that extract observables from the .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the second  in the sequence , whose predictions are shown by black full lines in , is less successful than the corresponding in potential i ( ) because it has too much rotation and too little random velocity ; in tables [ tab : fiti ] and [ tab : fitii ] this  is stands out for its exceptionally large value of @xmath15 for the thick disc .",
    "amoeba _ is allowed to adjust all the s parameters simultaneously , it increases the scale lengths of both discs from @xmath16 to @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the thin and thick discs , respectively , and reduces @xmath19 for both discs to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the predictions of the final  are shown by the red dotted curves in .",
    "they are less successful than the corresponding predictions in potential i in that the values of @xmath5 are too large and the other predictions are only comparably successful .",
    "the excessive values of @xmath5 suggest that potential ii has a disc that is too massive , and that a larger fraction of the mass that keeps @xmath14 high at @xmath22 should reside in the dark halo .",
    "an aspect of the fitting process that is troubling is that using only a thin disc _ amoeba _ is able to fit the wings as well as the cores of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 distributions of local stars ",
    "one would have expected the wings of these distributions to be filled out by the thick disc , just as is the case for the @xmath25 distribution .",
    "a consequence of this filling of the wings in @xmath23 and @xmath24 by the thin disc is that the thick discs subsequently fitted have unexpectedly small radial velocity - dispersion parameters , and these discs invariably have significantly larger vertical dispersions than radial ones .",
    "shows the result of attempting to remedy this situation by fixing the parameters of the thin - disc  to those listed in column ( e ) of table  [ tab : fiti ] and then asking _ amoeba _ to choose the thick - disc parameters that minimise the residuals between the model and ( i ) the gilmore - reid points for @xmath26 , ( ii ) the gcs counts at @xmath27 and ( iii ) the gcs counts at @xmath28 .",
    "the chosen  provides perfect fits to @xmath26 and @xmath29 .",
    "the fit to @xmath30 is good at @xmath31 but significantly too sharply peaked at @xmath32 .",
    "the fit to @xmath2 is excellent at @xmath33 but is slightly lower than the data indicate at greater heights .",
    "however , shows that this model predicts too many stars with low @xmath3 .",
    "the surplus of low - angular - momentum stars becomes more marked as one moves away from the plane , and is a clear consequence of the thick disc being too hot radially .",
    "this experiment forces us to the conclusion that the thick disc really is hotter vertically than horizontally , and is indeed radially cooler than the thin disc .",
    "moreover , it implies that the ability of the thin - disc  to fit even the wings of the gcs @xmath23 and @xmath24 distributions does not arise from an incorrect choice for the thin - disc s s dependence on @xmath6 , but reflects the fact that these wings are populated by stars that do not stray far from the plane .",
    "when _ amoeba _ is permitted to adjust all nine parameters of the combined  simultaneously , it achieves slightly better representations of the data for the solar cylinder by adopting s that have unexpected , even implausible , radial structure .",
    "in particular there is a systematic tendency to choose for the thick disc a large radial scale - length and a large ( and compensating ) value of the parameter @xmath34 that controls the radial gradient of velocity dispersion .",
    "it seems that although data for the solar cylinder do very strongly constrain the s of the individual discs , they do not suffice to prevent one disc being played off against the other in unphysical ways .",
    "it is likely that such trade - offs would be suppressed if we had data that spanned a wider radial range .",
    "the ability to distinguish chemically several populations of stars is a crucial aspect of astronomy that has been neglected in this work .",
    "the division of the disc into thin and thick components acquires objective meaning only when it is possible to distinguish stars of the two discs by age or metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the present models seem to require that the radial and azimuthal velocity dispersion of the population of @xmath35-enhanced ( and thus thick - disc ) stars is smaller than its vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "this is a prediction that can be tested when large samples of photometrically selected stars with known abundances become available .    whatever the outcome of this test , each chemically distinguishable population has an independent , and the requirement that different populations co - exist within a common gravitational potential will surely provide the strongest constraints on the galaxy s mass distribution .",
    "consequently , it is important to extend our formulae for the  to include chemical properties such as [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath35/h ] .",
    "we hope to present such extensions shortly .",
    "once one recognises that the galaxy contains stars that span a range of age and chemistry , one has to engage with the differing propensities of stars to be picked up in a given survey .",
    "some surveys select stars kinematically , some by colour and all select by apparent magnitude , so to predict from a  the numbers of stars of each species predicted in a given survey , one has to fold predictions of type presented here through a code such as _ galaxia _ @xcite that produces number counts from phase - space distributions .",
    "we hope soon to present results obtained in this way .",
    "we do not quote errors on the parameters of our models for two reasons . first _",
    "amoeba _ merely seeks the minimum of a function , and determining the errors on the nine parameters and their correlations would involve a computational effort comparable to that involved in locating the minimum .",
    "second , the formal errors are of little interest because the uncertainties in the parameters are not determined by the statistical errors , in the data , which are for the most part small , but by systematics , such as the existence of substructure that can not be represented by the models .",
    "in fact , the values of @xmath36 per degree of freedom are quite large ( @xmath37 ) so formally the models are inconsistent with the data .",
    "integral - field units now make it possible to map the line - of - sight velocity distribution and some chemical information across large parts of the images of external galaxies .",
    "traditionally these data have been interpreted with either schwarzschild models @xcite or models based on the jeans equations @xcite .",
    "these data could be interpreted with models similar to those presented here with greater ease than is possible with schwarzschild models and greater rigour than the jeans equations allow  the latter require an arbitrary closure assumption .",
    "this seems a fruitful direction for future work .",
    "the simplest dynamical models of our galaxy have distribution functions that are analytic functions of the action integrals of motion .",
    "we have fitted such s to measurements of the distribution of stellar velocities in the immediate neighbourhood of the sun , and to these data in conjunction with an estimate of the vertical density profile at the solar circle .",
    "we have done this for two models of the galaxy s gravitational potential that differ in their values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    using the potential with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the model optimised to fit only the local velocity distribution",
    "predicts a vertical density profile that fits the data below @xmath40 but falls increasingly below the data at greater distances from the plane .",
    "in fact it provides a good representation of the thin disc but deviates from the data where the thick disc is important because the local velocity distributions barely constrain the thick disc . when a thick disc is added and used to ensure that the density profile in the solar cylinder agrees with the measurements of @xcite , the model correctly ( i ) predicts a preliminary estimate of the run of vertical velocity dispersion with @xmath41 from the rave survey , ( ii ) fits two sets of measurements of @xmath42 at @xmath43 and ( iii ) predicts the distribution of @xmath24 components of sdss stars seen at @xmath44 .",
    "the single failure of this model is to predict values of @xmath45 smaller than those obtained from preliminary analysis of rave data .",
    "if the adopted gravitational potential were significantly in error , it should not be possible to fit simultaneously the vertical profiles of @xmath46 and @xmath5 , so our findings suggest that the adopted potential is close to the truth .",
    "when all nine parameters of the  are adjusted to refine the fits to the local velocity distributions and the vertical density profile , a model is obtained that predicts much better values of @xmath45 at the price of predicting smaller values of @xmath42 at @xmath47 than the raw data imply . after making allowance for observational error",
    ", the model does provide quite a good fit to the measured distribution of @xmath3 components at @xmath48 .    when the same exercise is conducted with a potential in which @xmath49 and @xmath50 , less satisfactory predictions are obtained .",
    "most strikingly , in this potential @xmath5 is predicted to be larger than the rave data imply , which suggests that this potential is generated by a disc that is more massive than the galaxy s disc .    at radii between @xmath51 and @xmath52 the favoured model s vertical density profile is well approximated by two exponentials , a steep one associated with the thin disc and a much shallower thick - disc profile .",
    "these profiles meet at an altitude @xmath53 . in this model",
    "the scale - height of the thin increases only slowly with radius , but that of the thick disc decreases with radius .",
    "below @xmath54 the mean - streaming velocity is similar at all radii and declines only slowly with increasing @xmath41 , especially at large @xmath55 . above @xmath56 and at larger radii",
    "the mean - streaming velocity declines more rapidly with increasing @xmath41 .",
    "a decline in mean - streaming velocity is always matched by an increase in azimuthal velocity dispersion .",
    "a surprising , but apparently robust , prediction of these models is that , in contrast to the thin disc , the thick disc is hotter vertically than horizontally .",
    "when kinematically unbiased samples of stars with measured chemical compositions are available , it will be possible to test this prediction observationally .",
    "a  of the type used here predicts many observables that we have not presented  for example the spatial distribution of stars of a given age or of the thick - disc stars , or the distributions of @xmath23 and @xmath25 components of velocity at @xmath44 or any other altitude .",
    "we will release programs that calculate these predictions and it will be instructive to compare the predictions with further observations .",
