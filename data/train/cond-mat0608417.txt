    "only one contact formed by a quantum point contact permits carrier exchange .",
    "the voltage @xmath2 controlls the transmission through the quantum point contact.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we are interested in the dynamics of a quantum coherent capacitor .",
    "we ask : if an excess charge has been created due to a sudden change in applied voltage or due to a spontaneous fluctuation , how long does it take for this excess charge to relax ? for a classical capacitor",
    "the answer is simply the @xmath3time . even for a quantum coherent capacitor ,",
    "the answer can be expressed in terms of a capacitance and a charge relaxation resistance . however , the properties of these two transport coefficients can now differ dramatically from their classical counterparts .",
    "we use the term _ electrochemical capacitance _ to emphasize that the capacitance now depends on the physical properties of the system , and use the term _ charge relaxation resistance _ to emphasize that the resistance might be very different from what is expected classically .",
    "the system of interest is shown in figure 1 .",
    "a small cavity is connected via a single lead to a metallic contact and is capacitively coupled to a gate at voltage @xmath1 .",
    "the cavity acts as one plate of a capacitor and the gate as the second plate .",
    "the opening between the cavity and the metallic contact is formed by a quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "of interest is the entire transition from very weak coupling to very strong coupling when electrons can transmit the qpc with transmission probability 1 .",
    "a structure of this type was analyzed more than 13 years ago , by bttiker , prtre and thomas @xcite who found a charge relaxation resistance which in the case of a single channel of spin polarized electrons is given by half a resistance quantum independent of the transmission probability of the channel . interestingly , a recent experiment by gabelli et al .",
    "@xcite on a structure similar to that shown in figure 1 measured both the in - phase and the out - of - phase admittance and found excellent agreement with the predictions of ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular their experiments confirm the quantization of the charge relaxation resistance .",
    "much of mesoscopic physics has centered around a few elementary systems which best demonstrate a quantum effect of interest .",
    "examples are isolated rings which were shown to support a persistent current @xcite , rings with leads exhibit an aharonov - bohm effect in conductance @xcite , qpc s @xcite and quantum hall bars @xcite teach us about conductance quantization and quantum dots @xcite reveal in a striking manner coulomb blockade and kondo physics . clearly the mesoscopic capacitor is also such an elementary system : its major advantage is a complete suppression of dc - transport . unlike in systems with dc - transport where very high frequencies are required to make dynamic effects visible on top of the zero - frequency dc - response , here",
    "the dynamic effects provide the leading order of the system response .",
    "classically one might want to consider the sample in figure 1 as a series connection of a geometrical capacitance @xmath4 and a resistance @xmath5 .",
    "the capacitance @xmath4 is the geometric capacitance between the cavity and the gate and the resistance @xmath5 is that of the qpc . at low frequencies",
    "the conductance @xmath6 can be expanded in a power series to give @xmath7 the first term describes an out - of - phase response determined by the geometrical capacitance @xmath4 , whereas the second term is the in - phase , dissipative response determined by the resistance @xmath5 .",
    "the quantum coherent capacitor of interest here has an ac - conductance which can similarly be expanded in powers of @xmath8 but instead of the classical quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 is determined by an electrochemical capacitance @xmath9 and a charge relaxation resistance @xmath10 , @xmath11 the electrochemical capacitance @xmath9 differs from @xmath4 whenever the small system is not efficient in screening electric fields .",
    "the charge relaxation resistance @xmath10 reflects the fact that carriers injected into the cavity spend a time on this `` plate '' which is too short to equilibrate them @xcite and for this reason @xmath10 might differ from @xmath5 .",
    "the capacitance @xmath9 is related to the imaginary part of the ac conductance @xcite and is often measured dynamically @xcite but in theory it can also be obtained by differentiation of a thermodynamic ( grand - canonical ) potential @xcite . here",
    "we pursue a dynamic approach .",
    "bttiker , thomas and prtre @xcite developed a theory of charge relaxation of quantum coherent capacitors based on scattering theory and a self - consistent ( hartree like ) treatment of interactions .",
    "carriers from the reservoir enter the cavity and are eventually reflected .",
    "if the contact supports @xmath12 transverse channels , the reflection amplitudes can be described by an @xmath13 scattering matrix @xmath14 . since all carriers are reflected the eigen values of this scattering matrix are of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the increment in phase which a particle in the n - th eigen channel acquires upon reflection .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath10 depend on the derivative of such phases with respect to energy @xmath17 .",
    "the derivative is taken at the fermi energy . when multiplied by @xmath18",
    "the phase derivatives are the wigner - smith delay times .",
    "alternatively we can say that    @xmath19    is the contribution to the density of states in the cavity of the n - th eigen channel .",
    "the total density of states in the cavity at energy @xmath20 is @xmath21 . assuming that the potential inside the cavity can be described by a single variable and that coulomb coupling to the gate is described by a geometrical capacitance @xmath4 , refs .",
    "@xcite find for the electrochemical capacitance    @xmath22    if the coulomb interaction is weak @xmath23 the electrochemical capacitance is determined by the density of states @xmath24 , whereas if the energy to charge the cavity is large the capacitance is essentially determined by the geometrical capacitance @xmath25 . due to quantum interference the density of states @xmath26 exhibits mesoscopic fluctuations from sample to sample : no two capacitances are exactly equal . for a single channel connected to a chaotic cavity",
    "these fluctuations are discussed by gopar , mello and bttiker @xcite . for a cavity coupled to many channel qpc s mesoscopic capacitance fluctuations",
    "are treated by brouwer and bttiker @xcite and brouwer et al.@xcite .    for the charge relaxation resistance ref .",
    "@xcite finds ,    @xmath27 ^ 2 } .\\ ] ]    perhaps the most striking prediction of this approach is that if the connection between cavity and reservoir permits transmission of at most one spin polarized quantum channel ( n = 1 in equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) ) , the charge relaxation resistance at zero temperature is equal to half a resistance quantum  @xcite    @xmath28    this should be contrasted with the resistance @xmath29 with @xmath30 the transmission probability , which we would expect if inelastic scattering is sufficiently strong to relax the carriers in the cavity toward an equilibrium distribution .",
    "the prediction is for a resistance that is entirely independent of the scattering properties of the channel !",
    "note that the predicted charge relaxation resistance is not @xmath31 , the resistance of a perfect two - probe single channel conductor but only half a dc - resistance quantum of a single channel .",
    "the experiment by gabelli et al .",
    "@xcite measures both the in and out of phase parts of the ac conductance of a mesoscopic rc circuit .",
    "the sample similar to figure 1 with a sub - micron sized cavity is cooled to sub - kelvin temperatures and subjected to an ac voltage in the ghz range .",
    "a high magnetic field is applied such that only a single spin polarized edge channel is partially transmitted and reflected at the qpc .",
    "gabelli et al .",
    "@xcite develop a model which permits to determine @xmath9 and @xmath10 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3],[eq:4 ] ) and compare with experiment . in their model",
    "the scattering matrix follows from fabry - prot like multiple reflections in the cavity .",
    "the results of this experiment are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of  @xcite , in particular they confirm the universality of the single channel charge relaxation resistance over a range of voltages over which the transmission probability of the qpc varies substantially .",
    "two effects might give rise to deviations from the quantized charge relaxation resistance , equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) : first , as the transmission probability @xmath30 through the contact becomes sufficiently small , the time a carrier spends inside the cavity will eventually become long compared to an inelastic time . as a consequence",
    "we expect realistically that for very small contact transparencies there is a cross - over from @xmath10 given by equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) to the `` classical '' result @xmath32 .",
    "second , for small transparencies , charge quantization ( coulomb blockade ) will become important and the random phase approach used by bttiker et al.@xcite might fail .",
    "the second question has already been addressed in recent work by nigg , lopez and bttiker @xcite .",
    "these authors show that the charge relaxation resistance @xmath10 remains quantized even in the strong coulomb blockade limit . to demonstrate this ,",
    "an approach is developed which is based on a hartree - fock treatment which explicitly excludes self - interaction .",
    "for many channel contacts , the resulting expressions for @xmath10 , like the expressions derived from the hartree approach , can be formulated in terms of density of states or the time - delay of particles .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to present the results for the electrochemical capacitance @xmath9 in the presence of interactions treated on the hartree - fock level .",
    "below we outline how the density of states are obtained within a hartree - fock approach . we then present results for the mesoscopic capacitance and the total charge in the dot as the transmission through the contact increases from zero to one .",
    "for a moment consider the cavity disconnected from the lead . in hartree - fock",
    "the isolated dot is described by the effective single particle hamiltonian @xmath33 . in the eigen basis @xmath34 of the hamiltonian",
    ", we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the hartree - fock level energies .",
    "coupling the cavity via a single quantum channel to the states in the leads with tunnel matrix elements @xmath37 gives rise to a scattering matrix  @xcite @xmath38 with @xmath39 where @xmath40 the function @xmath41 determines the phase @xmath42 which a carrier acquires upon reflection through @xmath43 . the density of states of the cavity @xmath44",
    "is then given by @xmath45 with @xmath46 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] note that this expression for the density of states differs from the often used breit - wigner expression .",
    "according to equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) the density of states at every energy depends on all the eigen energies ( poles ) , except exactly at the resonance energy @xmath47 where the density of states is @xmath48 .",
    "we next specify how we treat interaction . in hartree - fock",
    "the self - energy is @xcite @xmath49.\\ ] ] here @xmath50 is a charging energy .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ eq:10 ] ) is the hartree energy determined by the occupied states .",
    "the occupation number operator of the state @xmath51 in the dot is @xmath52 where @xmath53 annihilates a carrier in the cavity .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ eq:10 ] ) is of central importance for the description of charge quantization effects : the second term excludes self - interaction . note that the self - energy is a matrix with dimension @xmath54 equal to the number of states in the dot . in the following we neglect the off - diagonal elements of this matrix .",
    "these elements account for weak inter - level exchange interactions and for the parameters of interest here affect the results only quantitatively @xcite . with this approximation",
    "the self - consistent hartree - fock level energies are given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the bare ( non - interacting ) energy of level @xmath58 .",
    "( [ eq:9],[eq:10],[eq:11 ] ) are a set of self - consistent equations which we solve iteratively .",
    "to proceed , we now assume for simplicity that the non - interacting energy levels are equidistant in energy with a spacing @xmath59 .",
    "we also assume that all levels couple with the same strength @xmath60 to the lead .",
    "furthermore we use a result from ref .",
    "@xcite which relates the coupling constant and the bare level spacing to the transmission probability @xmath30 through the contact , @xmath61 this is a local relation and thus also valid in the coulomb blockade regime . to complete our model",
    "we connect the transmission probability through the qpc to the fermi energy , @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "this expression is appropriate for a qpc with an ( inverted ) parabolic potential @xcite .",
    "here @xmath63 determines the energy at which transmission is @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a constant which depends on the curvatures of the saddle point potential .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cmu ] we show the zero temperature electrochemical capacitance @xmath9 and the total dot charge @xmath12 for different interaction strengths @xmath66 and @xmath67 as a function of the fermi energy . in all the graphs",
    "the probability for transmission through the qpc is shown as a dashed red curve .",
    "the total number of levels in the dot is @xmath68 .",
    "as expected , for very small transmission , the capacitance has sharp coulomb peaks at energies at which transfer of a carrier into the dot is permitted .",
    "the charge increases step like with flat plateau regions in which charge is quantized .",
    "as the contact is opened the peak height decreases and the width of the capacitive coulomb peaks increases . even when the quantum channel is completely open , the density of states , equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) , exhibits weak oscillations .",
    "this is similar to a chaotic cavity which even for a completely transparent quantum channel exhibits density of states fluctuations and thus capacitance fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the existence of oscillations for @xmath69 differs from the model used by gabelli et al .",
    "@xcite where the cavity was treated as a fabry - prot resonator . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the capacitance oscillations are proportional to the amplitude of reflection of the qpc . the model of gabelli et al .",
    "@xcite is appropriate for electron motion along edge states . clearly , if the qpc becomes completely transparent to an edge state there is no interference , thus no density oscillation and thus no capacitance oscillation .",
    "in contrast the approach used here is suitable if only a weak magnetic field is applied ( corresponding to a flux through the cavity of the order of a flux quantum ) .",
    "the ( green ) curves connecting the peaks in figure 2 show the capacitance calculated with the density of states @xmath70 .",
    "deep in the coulomb blockade regime this function coincides with the local maxima of the electrochemical capacitance , however , with increasing transparency , as neighboring peaks start to overlap , the maxima of the capacitance cease to be determined by a single hartree - fock level .",
    "the graphs on the right hand side of figure 2 show that with increasing transparency trough the qpc charge oscillations become ever weaker and for large transmission we have a nearly continuous increase of the charge in the cavity . while semi - classical theory of the coulomb blockade leads to charge steps which are infinitely sharp in the zero - temperature limit , here the sharpness of the charge steps depends on the transmission probability .",
    "other systems which exhibit charge steps which are not infinitely sharp even in the zero temperature limit are cooper pair boxes @xcite(where the slope has been measured @xcite ) but also single electron systems like rings with in line or side quantum dots @xcite .",
    "in this work we have examined coulomb blockade oscillations for mesoscopic quantum coherent capacitors .",
    "we present an effective single particle approach using scattering theory and treating interactions on the level of a hartree - fock approach which excludes self - interactions .",
    "this approach preserves quantum coherence and at the same time takes effects of charge quantization into account . for a nearly isolated cavity",
    "the capacitance exhibits sharp and well seprated coulomb peaks .",
    "as expected , with increasing coupling between cavity and reservoir charge quantization effects diminish .",
    "however , interestingly , we find that even for a completely transparent quantum channel capacitance oscillations persist .",
    "these oscillations reflect quantum coherent scattering in the cavity .",
    "the results presented here can be experimentally tested .",
    "experiments @xcite in high magnetic fields have already reported clear signatures of a quantum coherent capacitor .",
    "our results should be useful in finding such signatures in the low magnetic field range .",
