",
    "[ sect : model ] describes the numerical model ,  [ sect : results ] presents the results , and ",
    "[ sect : summary ] summarizes and discusses their implications .",
    "we start with the same initial conditions as paper  i , i.e. , a kiloparsec - sized box at @xmath15 from the galactic center extracted from the tt09 simulation .",
    "we include the same physical processes , i.e. , heating / cooling functions developed in paper  i , and adopt a static background potential yielding flat rotation curve of @xmath16 .",
    "as the tt09 simulation is nonmagnetic , no self - consistent initial magnetic field configuration is available .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we thread the domain with uniform @xmath2-field along the shearing direction , i.e. , @xmath17 . for @xmath18 we assume 0 ( no @xmath2-field ) , 10 or 80@xmath19 g .",
    "the 10@xmath19 g case represents field strengths close to mean galactic values expected at an inner ( @xmath20  kpc ) location .",
    "the 80@xmath19 g case exceeds observed kpc - scale @xmath2-fields by @xmath21dex , but allows for stronger fields inside gmcs and their substructures , which are already present in the initial conditions .",
    "using the empirical relation of @xcite , a field strength of @xmath22 g corresponds to a density of @xmath23 . the mean density of the two most massive gmcs identified in paper i is @xmath24 and @xmath25 , but they contain substructures extending to more than ten times higher densities",
    ". thus our adopted high magnetic field case may be more appropriate for predicting the dynamical evolution of these dense clumps and filaments .",
    "the above field strengths can also be compared to the critical values needed to support idealized self - gravitating clouds of a given mass surface density @xmath26 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the tt09 simulation gmcs have typical @xmath27 , so only in the strongest field case do we expect significant influence on global gmc dynamics .",
    "indeed , only in this 80@xmath19 g case are initial mass - to - flux ratios of the three least massive gmcs below the critical value .",
    "otherwise , the gmcs are supercritical by at least an order of magnitude",
    ". a larger number of intermediate @xmath2-field strengths and different initial geometries will be explored in a future paper .        to solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations we use the adaptive mesh refinement mhd code",

    "note that , with the magnetic jeans length @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 the alfvn speed and @xmath31 the sound speed ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , artificial fragmentation is less likely when a magnetic field is included .",
    "we adopt the same boundary conditions ( pseudo - shearing box ) and effective grid resolution of 2048@xmath324096 ( by using a root grid resolution of 128@xmath32256 with 4 refinement levels ) as paper  i. again , we follow evolution for 10@xmath33 , less than one shear - flow crossing time over the domain",
    ".    inclusion of a uniform magnetic field in the domain introduces a numerical issue : the simulation time step is determined by the low density external medium and is @xmath34 of that in the disk midplane ( region of primary interest ) . to speed up the simulation",
    ", we artificially reduce the magnetosonic sound speed by adopting the boris method with a maximum magnetosonic sound speed of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "although this procedure is , in principle , only valid for simulations of steady state problems , it is still applicable when the flow velocities are much smaller than the sound speed .",
    "following methods of paper i , to model star formation we allow collisionless star cluster particles , i.e. , point masses representing star clusters or sub - clusters of minimum mass @xmath36 , to form .",
    "these particles are created when the density within a cell exceeds a star formation threshold value of @xmath37 .",
    "we assume a local sfr that converts a fraction , @xmath38 , of gas above the threshold density into stars per local free - fall time @xcite .",

    "the pure hydrodynamical model has a very fragmented structure , which becomes smoother as magnetic field strength increases .",
    "significant differences are also seen in the temperature distributions , which are the result of different gas densities ( and thus different heating / cooling rates and equilibrium temperatures ) and also different amounts of shock heating from large scale flows and accretion heating from dense clump formation .",

    "the magnetic critical mass of spherical clouds , @xmath47 @xcite , shows we expect a factor @xmath48 change in typical cloud mass comparing 10 and 80@xmath46 g cases , which is seen in the median cloud masses .    in figures  [ fig :",
    "surface_density ] and [ fig : regions ] we also see that the magnetic field is more distorted by gas motions in region 1 than region 2 . in the @xmath44 g run , filaments predominantly lie parallel or perpendicular to field orientation . on @xmath49 scales , the 80@xmath46 g fields are harldly affected by the cloud motions , but do become more distorted and disordered in regions of high star formation activity .",
    "we also quantify ism structure by examining the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of @xmath4 ( as viewed from above the disk ) and number density of h nuclei , @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdfs ] shows these quantities weighted by area / volume ( top row ) and by mass ( bottom row ) .",
    "the @xmath4 pdf is a directly observable feature of clouds and galaxies , while the volume density pdf needs to be reconstructed using different techniques ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath4 pdfs show the typical combination of a log - normal with power - law tail at high surface densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the transition occurs around @xmath51 , corresponding roughly to the minimum @xmath4 of regions containing `` cloud '' ( gmc ) gas , which is essentially all part of self - gravitating structures .",
    "there is variation from region to region , with region 1 having its log - normal peaking at higher @xmath4 .",
    "the shape of the power - law distribution differs only slightly between these individual regions , roughly scaling as @xmath52 with @xmath53 for the area - weighted pdf , and thus relatively flat slopes of the mass - weighted distributions .",
    "power law tail normalization at given @xmath4 is several times higher in region 1 than region 2 , i.e. , the former has a higher dense gas mass fraction .",
    "this also correlates with its more fragmented morphology and larger sfr ( below ) .",
    "there are only modest differences seen in the pdfs as a function of magnetic field strength ( although note the large dynamic range in the figures ) . at",
    "higher @xmath4 , these are more clearly seen in region 2 , which also shows the greatest effect from @xmath2-field strength on its degree of fragmentation and sfr ( below ) .    comparing to observations , somewhat steeper indices , i.e. , @xmath54 ,",
    "have been reported in dust - emission - derived @xmath4 pdfs by @xcite .",
    "we note that some extinction - based studies find pdfs that can be fit by a single log - normal up to @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "note , these observations are derived from `` in - plane '' higher - resolution views of clouds , in contrast to the `` top - down '' views of the galactic plane from the simulations .",
    "direct observational constraints of top - down views are expected to be able to achieved with high angular resolution observations of nearby galactic disks , e.g. , with _",
    "volume density pdfs in the simulations show similar trends as the @xmath4 pdfs , with region 1 having a larger fraction of gas at higher densities . for @xmath56 ,",
    "i.e. , the cloud gas , the distributions can be reasonably well approximated with single power laws up to @xmath57 with power law index of @xmath58 .",
    "here we consider the time evolution of cloud ( @xmath59 ) and clump ( @xmath60 ) mass fractions over the @xmath61 timescale of the simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massfraction ] ) . for the whole kpc - sized region ,",
    "cloud mass fractions start from relatively high values , @xmath62 , inherited from the tt09 simulation . over @xmath61 , they show a moderate decline , partly because of the build up a mass fraction in stars , and partly in the magnetized cases from expansion of cloud envelopes due to the introduced magnetic pressure .",
    "clump mass fractions grow to peak values of @xmath63 , with smaller peak values reached more slowly as @xmath2-field is increased .",
    "since stars are only allowed to form from clump gas , sfr evolution closely tracks clump mass fraction evolution , although it exhibits more stochasticity . at late times",
    "the different models appear to converge in their clump mass fractions and sfrs , perhaps due to the exhaustion of most of the initially unstable gas via star formation .",
    "regions 1 and 2 follow similar trends .",
    "indeed region  1 s area of 0.16@xmath64 contains large fractions of the clump mass and star formation of the whole kpc region .",
    "region  2 starts with gas structures that are somewhat easier to stabilize with magnetic fields ( at least in directions perpendicular to the initial @xmath65-direction field orientation ) , so larger differences are seen in clump and sfr evolution as field strength is increased .",
    "region 1 contains @xmath66 as much cloud gas as region  2 .",
    "it contains two gmcs in the process of merging , and the resulting cloud has significant kinetic energy .",
    "the magnetic field therefore plays a minor role in this case .",
    "the overall sfr surface densities are about @xmath67 larger in region 1 compared to region 2 .",
    "some caveats are in order .",
    "first , the formation of clumps is a response to simulation initial conditions , where dense , self - gravitating clouds are allowed to collapse to high densities as the resolution is suddenly increased .",
    "second , once formed , star particles contribute gravitationally , but stellar feedback , implementation of which is much more uncertain and numerically challenging , is not yet included in the simulation .      .",
    "colors indicate magnetic field strength : @xmath42 g ( black ) , @xmath44 g ( blue ) and @xmath3 g ( red ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    the detailed time history of clump and star formation is sensitive to the choice of initial conditions .",
    "it is therefore useful to compare the sfr averaged over the full @xmath61 evolution to the observations since these are also averaged over @xmath68 .",
    "here we consider the absolute and relative average sfrs that are seen in the simulations on the kiloparsec , `` region '' and `` cloud '' ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : ks ] shows sfr surface density , @xmath70 , versus @xmath4 .",
    "observational results are those of @xmath71kpc - scale regions of galactic disks from @xcite and of individual galactic gmcs from @xcite . on the kpc region scale , the simulations all start with @xmath72 , decreasing to @xmath73 after 10  myr for @xmath74 g cases , respectively , i.e. , @xmath75 . on these scales ,",
    "the magnetic field only has a modest impact on sfr , the values of which are much higher ( @xmath76 ) than systems with equivalent @xmath4 observed by @xcite the equivalent hydrodynamic run with",
    "_ mg _ , which we attribute to our implementation of improved methods for staggering introduction of amr at early times in the simulation .",
    "however , as noted in ",
    "[ s : timeevol ] , total sfr is dominated by that occurring in region 1 .",
    "when separate results for regions 1 and 2 are considered , we see more significant effects of increasing the magnetic field strength : a factor of 3 reduction in region 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ks ] ) .    focusing on smaller @xmath69-size `` cloud '' scales ( see fig .  1 ) , we find simulated sfrs overlap with observational rates in galactic gmcs derived by @xcite .",
    "stronger magnetic fields again almost always lead to lower sfrs .",
    "one reason for the decrease in sfr with increasing @xmath2-field is that clumps form later in models with stronger fields (  [ s : timeevol ] ) . in one case , cloud h",
    ", stars only form in the @xmath77 run .",
    "our simulations thus reproduce sfrs similar to some observed local galactic gmcs .",
    "note the heiderman et al .",
    "gmcs do not contain especially vigorous regions of massive star formation , so may be relatively less affected by internal star formation feedback .",
    "on the kpc scale , even our strongly magnetized simulation has values of @xmath70 that are too large .",
    "however , this is largely a consequence of the `` starburst '' of region 1 .",
    "inclusion of star formation feedback is expected to have an impact in reducing this activity , to be investigated in a future paper .",
    "we have studied the effects of magnetic fields on molecular clouds extracted from a global galaxy simulation , especially for cloud structure and sfrs .",
    "magnetic fields suppress fragmentation , as expected from consideration of the magnetic critical mass .",
    "their effects on @xmath4 and @xmath50 pdfs are more modest .    in the context of models of star formation from gas above a threshold density ( @xmath78 ) , we find that on the largest kpc scale , average sfrs are only modestly suppressed by magnetic fields .",
    "however , this is due to the presence of a starbursting region ( region 1 ) in the simulation domain .",
    "considering other regions , including down to `` gmc''-scales of @xmath79pc , we find a variety of @xmath70s , with values quite similar to those of some galactic gmcs .",
    "average suppression factors of @xmath80 for @xmath81 g compared to the nonmagnetized case are seen in the clouds , but in some cases there can be much more dramatic effects , including complete suppression in one cloud .    as a numerical experiment , this study highlights several important aspects , including issues of @xmath2-field initialization when overdense structures are already present in initial conditions .",
    "stochastic effects are important , i.e. , variation in behavior of individual gmcs , and kpc - scale sfrs can be influenced by a single gmc complex . a sub - grid model for star formation",
    "is needed : here via a chosen threshold density and an empirically motivated efficiency per local free - fall time , @xmath38 .",
    "such low efficiencies may require the effects of local star formation feedback , like protostellar outflows , to maintain turbulence and prolong star cluster formation @xcite .",
    "and/or they may result from the influence of magnetic fields themselves .",
    "note , we have not included magnetic field effects on the star formation sub - grid model , rather keeping its empirically - based parameters fixed for simplicity .",
    "there is scope in future work for exploring magnetic sub - grid star formation models , where cell mass - to - flux ratio is also an input , which should lead to a more natural threshold criterion for star formation activity .",
    "other effects of local star formation feedback , such as stellar winds , ionization and supernovae , have not yet been included in these simulations , but are expected to act to further reduce sfrs . to disentangle",
    "the relative importance of these effects and of magnetic fields will require testing many properties of the simulated clouds and young stellar populations against observed systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
