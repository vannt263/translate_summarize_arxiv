    "very little is known about the mid - ir ( 5 @xmath6 40@xmath0 m ) properties of distant galaxies , wavelengths which should probe their dust content and star formation activity . iras data established that mid - ir emission from the interstellar medium and from nearby star forming galaxies is dominated by emission from very small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pahs ) which have fluctuating temperatures under single photon absorption ,",
    "whereas classical grains are in thermal equilibrium and emit at longer wavelengths ( helou 1986 ) .",
    "however , the precise nature of pahs remains open ( puget & lger 1989 ) .",
    "differences in mid - ir features among various galaxies can be attributed to differing amounts of dust , broad emission interpreted as due to pahs or unidentified infrared bands ( uibs ) carriers .",
    "the pah and very small grains appear to be responsible for @xmath730% of the total ir emission in normal galaxies , but in active galactic nuclei , the mid - ir emission is believed to arise from a dusty torus around the active nucleus where pahs are destroyed ( edelson & malkan 1986 , roche et al .",
    "1991 , helou et al . , 1991 ) .    in order to study the mid - ir emission from high redshift galaxies , deep iso ( infrared space observatory , kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) observations were made of the cfrs field at 1415 + 52 .",
    "extensive spectroscopic and @xmath8 and @xmath9 photometric data already exist ( lilly et al .",
    "1995a , b ) for galaxies in this field , as well as data from a deep ( s@xmath10 16 @xmath0jy ) radio survey by fomalont et al .",
    "the high spatial resolution in the micro - scanning mode , combined with the good sensitivity of cam ( csarsky et al . 1996 ) allows mid - ir maps of high redshift field galaxies to be made for the first time .",
    "even so , precise identification of faint iso sources with such galaxies is difficult , owing to their faintness and to the inherent uncertainties in the source positions .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows ; sect .",
    "2 presents the observational and data reduction strategy ; sect .",
    "3 gives a description of the catalogue , astrometry and identification of optical counterparts . in sect .",
    "4 the photometric and spectrophotometric properties of the iso objects are discussed .",
    "section 5 summarizes the results of the identification procedure and , finally , our conclusions about the faint mid - ir sources are discussed in sect .",
    "the nature of 6.75@xmath0 m sources and their energy distribution from uv to radio wavelengths will be fully discussed in a forthcoming paper ( flores et al , 1998 ) , which will also present the 15@xmath0 m data .",
    "a @xmath11 region centered on the cfrs 1415 + 52 field was observed with iso in a raster pattern such that a constant exposure time per pixel was achieved over the whole 10  @xmath12 10  cfrs field .",
    "given the small size of this field , it was decided to go as deep as possible with isocam at 6.75@xmath0 m , partly so that the results could be used as a possible template for the isocam central program for deep surveys ( csarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) , as well as for other large surveys .",
    "eleven individual images were taken in the micro scanning aot mode ( cam01 , a raster of 4@xmath124 with 8 or 12 readouts per step ) with the isocam lw channel ( 6  per pixel ) and the lw2 filter ( 58.5@xmath0 m ) , leading to a total integration time of @xmath7 600 sec pixel@xmath13 .",
    "the micro scanning mode provides the best spatial resolution through superposition of images .",
    "the same pixel of the sky was placed in different parts of the camera in order to minimize and detect any systematic effects .",
    "the micro scanning aot technique also allows an accurate flat - field image to be generated and yields a pixel size of 15 in the final integrated image .",
    "the detection and removal of transients and glitches , integration of images , absolute flux calibration , and source detection were carried out using the method described by dsert et al .",
    "this method has been found to be particularly well adapted to our observational strategy i.e. coadding the eleven images , without redundancy within each image .",
    "special attention was paid to possible error propagation in the flux values .",
    "finally , to further detect and eliminate relatively weak ( s / n  @xmath7  3 ) spurious sources , the data were also reduced with the cia preti software ( aussel et al .",
    "1997 and starck et al . 1998 ) and compared with the initial results .",
    "however latter software is less adapted to our data since we have generated several images the micro scanning technique , and glitch removing is more difficult .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to compare the two data reduction procedures in order to estimate the photometric accuracy , and this question is addressed elsewhere ( desert et al . , 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "sources which have not recovered with preti software will not be further considered ( sect . 2.1 )    individual images were carefully registered with each other in order to optimize the image quality of the brightest compact objects ( mostly stars ) .",
    "however , this registration is limited by the presence of glitches ( defaults and cosmic rays ) . in order to obtain the best possible accuracy ,",
    "an iterative procedure was adopted in which shifts were determined from the average of the 35 highest s / n sources in each of the 11 individual images and the composite image , the frames were then offset and combined to form a new composite image , and the procedure repeated three times . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 , this results in a significant improvement of the shapes and fwhm of the sources . the final image ( fig .",
    "2 ) of the whole iso field has a resolution equivalent to a median fwhm@xmath711  ( calculated with daophot under iraf ) .",
    "the precise location of the isocam image relative to deep cfrs @xmath14 and @xmath15 images of the 1415 + 52 field was determined from the six brightest isocam lw2 sources ( 5 stars and the z = 0.216 galaxy cfrs14.1157 ) .",

    "1998 and references therein).at the s / n @xmath16 4 limit , our number counts ( 21 per 100 arcmin@xmath17 ) are comparable to those of the deep isocam survey ( @xmath18 counts per arcmin@xmath17 for sources with a flux @xmath19 250 @xmath0jy , csarsky et al . 1998 , in prep . ) . the validity of detection at s / n @xmath16 4 is confirmed by studies in lockman - hole deep survey(csarsky et al .",
    "1998 , in prep ) , which show that sources with s / n @xmath20 in individual frames are confirmed in 95% of cases , in the final integrated image ( s / n @xmath19 10 )      classifications and verification of the source detections were made on the basis of s / n and the repeatability of the detections in three independent combinations of the 11 individual images ( for details about the source detection , repeatability and classification , see dsert et al .",
    "the repeatability test is based on the redundancy factor , which is the number of times that the sky pixel was seen by different pixels on the camera .",
    "the software built three independent projection subrasters , and for each source candidate the flux and error are measured at the same position in each subrasters .",
    "the quality factor is based on flux measurements and varies from the best confidence index ( = 4 ) to the worse confidence level ( = 0 , see eqs .",
    "7 to 11 of dsert et al.,1998 ) .",
    "we have considered only sources with confidence level higher than 3 , which means that the final source flux and source fluxes in subrasters are within 3 @xmath21 ( 2 @xmath21 in the case of 4 ) , where @xmath21 is the error value of the final flux source .",
    "+ the final catalogued sources were also all detected in the image which was reduced by the second independent analysis ( using preti ) .",
    "altogether , 54 sources with s / n  @xmath16  3 met these criteria , but only the subgroup of 23 sources with s / n  @xmath16  4 are considered to be secure detections .",
    "the 54 sources are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the first two sections of table 1 contain 21 iso sources ( catalogues 1 & 2 ) that have secure optical identifications .",
    "the 24 sources in the lower half of table 1 and the 9 sources in table 2 have less secure or no optical identifications , respectively .",
    "to derive accurate positions of the iso sources is limited by ( a ) the large pixel size ( 6 ) of the initial image , ( b ) the size of the diffraction disk ( 2 to 3 ) , and ( c ) errors in the data reduction procedure ( including those due to distortion corrections ) .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the cfrs galaxies in 1415 + 52 field is 015 relative to radio positions ( hammer et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the overall centering of the isocam field was based on the positions of the 5 brightest stars and the bright cfrs14.1157 source .",
    "the resulting differences between the optical and iso positions for all sources with counterparts ( see next section ) are shown in fig .",
    "all but 9 of the sources are within a radius equivalent to one pixel ( 6 ) in the original isocam data . from comparison of the positions of optical and isocam lw2 sources ,",
    "the median difference is @xmath742 .",
    "we have first compared the 6.75@xmath0 m frame with @xmath0jy radio sources ( fomalont et al , 1991 ) , and have calculated the probability of a pure coincidence , assuming poisson statistics :    @xmath22    where d is the angular distance between the isocam lw3 source and the radio source in degrees and",
    "n is the integrated density of radiosources at flux @xmath23 ( n@xmath24 ) = 83520 @xmath25 ) .",
    "six isocam lw2 sources are thus identified ( see table 1 ) with their optical counterparts derived from hammer et al ( 1995 ) .",

    "( 1995c ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the relationship between the s / n of the isocam observation and the probability ( p ) that the optical source is projected by pure coincidence .",
    "we are aware that possible non gaussian positional uncertainties related to extended emission , source confusion and residuals can affect our probability calculations for low s / n sources . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , some sources present asymmetric shapes , and for few of them , only a part of the isocam source overlaps the optical counterpart .",
    "indeed the final noise structure is far from being gaussian , due to possible glitch residuals , and the isocam position has not been corrected for possible image distortions . to calibrate our probabilities in an empirical way",

    "non gaussian can not affect our probability calculations by more than a factor 2 .      as illustrated in fig .",
    "5 , six catalogues were constructed which contain identifications of varying degrees of confidence ( from 1  highest , to 6  no identification ) according to their probability ( p ) and s / n ratio .",
    "table 1 lists the identifications of iso sources in four of the catalogues ( in decreasing confidence level in each successive catalogue ) .",

    "indicates that the object has been identified spectroscopically as a star , ``  '' indicates that no redshift is available . columns ( 4 ) ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) give the @xmath26 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 magnitudes ( a ``  '' indicates that no photometry is available ) ; column ( 7 ) lists the angular distance ( in arcsec ) between the isocam source and optical counterparts ; column ( 8) gives the associated probability of coincidence ; and columns ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) give the flux at 58.5 @xmath0 m and the error ( in @xmath0jy ) .",
    "the 21 sources listed in catalogues 1 and 2 are considered to have secure identifications since they are relatively strong sources ( s / n @xmath19 4 ) and have a relatively low probability of chance coincidence .",

    "the 24 sources in the supplementary catalogues 4 and 5 are identifications with lower s / n sources ( 4@xmath16s / n@xmath16 3 ) . in five cases in the `` least secure '' catalogue 5 ,",
    "more than one optical counterpart is listed as possibly being associated with an isocam source . in most cases ,",
    "the more probable counterpart is optically brighter than , or as bright as , the alternate , providing additional evidence that it is the likely counterpart . in the following analysis",
    "we use only the `` best '' optical identifications ( i.e. , those with the lowest probability of chance coincidence ) , but all counterparts with a probability within a factor two of the smallest probability are retained in table 1 for reference .",
    "statistically , 1.5 out of the 18 sources in catalogue 5 are expected to be purely chance coincidences . as well as",
    "having fainter mid - ir fluxes , the optical counterparts of these 24 sources are also fainter optically on average ( 8 are fainter than @xmath35 ) .    figure 6 shows the superposition of isocam lw2 source contours and the optical counterparts of 14 extragalactic sources ( from catalogues 1 , 2 , 4 & 5 ) with known redshifts .",

    "45 of the 54 isocam lw2 sources ( 83% ) were identified with galaxies and stars on composite @xmath36 images ( @xmath38 ) of the cfrs1415 + 52 field .",
    "21 of these have secure identifications with optical counterparts ( including 7 stars ) .",
    "as shown below , some of the visible - light properties of the 24 less secure counterparts add considerable support to their identifications .",
    "in addition to the 7 spectroscopically confirmed stars , three other sources have profiles of compact sources ( stars , qso s , etc ) on our @xmath15 band image , so that 10 of the 45 may be stars ( although the three could also be qsos , from b , v and i band images and colors ) .",
    "the photometric properties of the identified optical counterparts are illustrated in figs . 7 , 8 and 9 .",

    "in addition to the 17% of isocam lw2 sources that have no obvious optical counterparts , the counterparts for another 18% are fainter than the limit ( i@xmath39 = 22.5 ) of cfrs spectroscopy , and hence some of these may be at z@xmath191 .",
    "figure 8 compares the @xmath40 distribution of all the secure and less secure extragalactic identifications ( lower panel ) with the same distribution for all cfrs galaxies ( @xmath41 ) ( upper panel ) .",

    "figure 9 shows that the median of the @xmath2 histogram of the isocam sources identified with known galaxies is 0.5 mag redder than that of cfrs galaxies , which is @xmath43 mag .",

    "one of these is at z = 0.7 , but the other four are possible high redshift objects .",
    "spectra for 22 of the 45 optical counterparts of our isocam lw2 sources are available in the cfrs database ( including 7 stars , generally m or k stars ) .",
    "several methods were used to classify the objects through their spectra and other properties : diagnostic diagrams ( using o@xmath45/h@xmath46 , o@xmath47/h@xmath46 , h@xmath46 , s@xmath45/h@xmath48 , n@xmath45/h@xmath48 ratios ) , radio properties ( hammer et al . 1995 ) , star formation rate ( o@xmath453727  equivalent widths ) and the balmer index d(3550 @xmath49 3850 ) defined as @xmath50(3750 - 3950)/@xmath50(3450 - 3650 ) at rest ( see hammer et al .",

    "1998 , submitted ) .    as shown in figure 11 ,",
    "the median redshift of the 15 extragalactic sources is z @xmath7 0.60 , close to the average cfrs value ( this is not too surprising since our spectroscopic sample of isocam sources has the same optical flux limit as the cfrs ) .",
    "the two most distant objects are qsos at z @xmath7 1 and 1.6 ( schade et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the latter has the highest redshift in this cfrs field .",
    "most of the strongest sources with secure identifications ( catalogues 1 & 2 ) are agns ( qso and seyfert ) .",
    "a total of 54 mid - ir sources were detected in a deep survey of the cfrs 1415 + 52 field with isocam .",
    "the reliability of the detections of these predominantly very faint sources has been strengthened through comparison of the results of two completely independent analyses of the data .",
    "the counts at 6.75@xmath0 m are in a very good agreement with those of the deep isocam survey ( lockman - hole survey ) which is @xmath7 0.22 counts per sq .",
    "arcmin for @xmath54jy",
    ". further support for the reliability of the identifications is provided by the properties of their optical counterparts :    * in the cfrs 1415 + 52 field , there are only 25 radio - sources with @xmath55 ( hammer et al .",
    "1995 ) and 34 isocam sources with @xmath5 which are identified with i@xmath5622.5 galaxies ( out of a total of @xmath7600 i@xmath57  22.5 objects ) . based only on optical  ir astrometry six isocam sources",
    "are associated with radiosources , and the cumulative probability of finding 6 or more radiosources in this sample by chance is only 0.0037 . * among the 15 galaxies with spectra , 6 ( 40% ) are found to be agns , even though only 7% of cfrs galaxies are agn ( hammer et al .",
    "* of the star  forming galaxies , 7 out of 8 have a balmer index larger than the median value of cfrs galaxies , possibly implying a relationship between the presence of dust and the a - star population . also dusty galaxies present larger color indices ( flores et al . ,",

    "clearly , the isocam lw2 sources have different average properties than a random sample of cfrs galaxies , giving additional confidence in our detections , even down to @xmath59 .",
    "a total of 54 @xmath5 were detected in the 10  @xmath12  10  field . of these , 9 could not be identified with any optical counterparts to the limit of our optical images ( @xmath60 ) ; two sources with s /",

    "indeed there are several bright isocam sources ( including the brightest one , cfrs14.1157 ) which present this red excess . from a purely statistical point of view , this is not unexpected , since the isocam detections correspond to the small fraction ( 5% ) of i@xmath65 22.5 galaxies at @xmath66 which are the most extreme mid - ir emitters . on the other hand",

    "<S> deep 6.75@xmath0 m mid - ir isocam observations were obtained of the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) 1415 + 52 field with the infrared space observatory . </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the sources with optical counterparts is described in detail , and a classification scheme is devised which depends on the s / n of the detection and the inverse probability of chance coincidence . </S>",

    "<S> the isocam sources also display an ir excess , even when compared with heavily - reddened local starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> an upper limit of 30% of extragalactic iso sources could be at @xmath4 of the 44 @xmath5 sources which are non - stellar ( 7 `` spectroscopic '' and 3 `` photometric '' stars excluded ) . </S>"
