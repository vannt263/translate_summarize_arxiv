    "the accumulation of supernovae type ia data seems to confirm that the universe is today in an accelerated phase @xcite .",
    "the first indications of this accelerated phase came from the analysis of about @xmath2 supernovae .",
    "today , the data are approaching 300 supernovae @xcite , and those first conclusions , for the moment , are confirmed .",
    "the theoretical explanation of this surprising result is one of the most important challenge in cosmology . in order to obtain an accelerated phase ,",
    "a repulsive gravitational effect must be obtained .",
    "generally , this is achieved by introducing an exotic fluid which exhibits a negative pressure today , called dark energy ( for a recent review , see reference @xcite ) .",
    "the most natural candidate is a cosmological constant , since it is an inevitable consequence of considering quantum fields in a curved space - time .",
    "but , the cosmological constant proposal faces a major difficulty : the theoretical predicted value surpass the value induced by observation by 120 order of magnitudes .",
    "this discrepancy can be alleviated , but not solved , by considering , for example , supersymmetric theories .",
    "moreover , the introducing of a cosmological constant today does not explain the coincidence problem , the fact that the universe begun to accelerated very recently , after the completion of formation of local structures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies .    many other alternatives to the cosmological constant have been presented in the literature . in the quintessence program , a self - interacting scalar field",
    "is considered @xcite .",
    "the potential for the scalar field is such that initially the pressure is positive , in order to allow the formation of local structures , becoming latter negative , driving the acceleration of the universe .",
    "the coincidence problem may be addressed in this case .",
    "however , fine tuning is required .",
    "however , some more natural potentials have been determined using supergravity theories @xcite .",
    "other dark energy models appear in the literature : k - essence @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , viscous fluid @xcite , etc . here",
    ", we explore another possibility : the acceleration phase could be generated by a non - minimal coupling between a scalar field and the gravitational term .",
    "the paradigm of a scalar - tensor theory with non - minimal coupling is the brans - dicke theory , which is characterized by the lagrangian @xmath3 + l_m \\quad , \\ ] ] where @xmath0 is a coupling parameter and @xmath4 is a matter lagrangian .",
    "local tests at level of the solar system and stellar binary systems , restrict @xmath0 to be larger than around @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this makes the predictions of the brans - dicke theory almost indistinguishable of those coming from general relativity .",
    "the scalar field @xmath6 is related to the inverse of the gravitational coupling @xmath7 .",
    "some recent interesting proposals address the possibility that the gravitational coupling can depend on the scale , having different value at local and at cosmological scales @xcite . if such scale - dependent gravitational coupling can be satisfactorily implemented , it is possible to have smaller values for the parameter @xmath0 at cosmological scales , obtaining scenarios that differ substantially from those obtained from general relativity , while agreement with local tests is preserved .",
    "studies of quantum effects in gravitational theories , and their consequence for the behaviour of the gravitational coupling , have strengthened those proposals @xcite .    in reference @xcite ,",
    "general cosmological solutions for a flat universe in the brans - dicke theory were determined . for a pressureless fluid , such solutions can interpolate a decelerating phase with an accelerated phase .",
    "this is an example of how cosmological models in brans - dicke theory may differ substantially from the standard cosmological model : using general relativity such interpolation can just be obtained through introduction of an exotic fluid .",
    "however , the price to pay is not negligible : the brans - dicke parameter must takes values in the interval @xmath8 , implying that the effective gravitational coupling is negative . the possibility of",
    "a scale - dependent gravitational coupling may render , however , such scenarios attractive .    these solutions with a late accelerated phase were studied in reference @xcite .",
    "here we make a step further : a comparison with the supernovae type ia data is made , using the `` gold sample '' .",
    "this brans - dicke late accelerated model gives better agreement with the observational data than the @xmath1 model .",
    "the best fitting for the brans - dicke parameter and the hubble parameter @xmath9 are obtained , indicating @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the approach here differs from others existing in the literature which studies accelerated models in brans - dicke theory @xcite by the fact that no other ingredient is introduced , like a potential term for the scalar field .",
    "but , the model requires an effective mechanism that leads to a repulsive gravitational coupling at cosmological scales , while keeping it attractive at local scales .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in next section ,",
    "the pressureless brans - dicke cosmological model is revised . in section @xmath12 , the comparison with the supernovae type ia `` gold sample '' is made . in section",
    "@xmath13 we present our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a flat brans - dicke cosmology , with the universe filled with pressureless matter .",
    "the equations of motion resulting from the lagrangian ( [ lagran ] ) are : @xmath14 the last equation leads to @xmath15 . inserting this relation in ( [ em2 ] ) ,",
    "we find the first integral , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "following @xcite , we can define an auxiliary function @xmath18 , satisfying the relation @xmath19 which , in view of the equations of motion , results in the integral relation @xmath20 } = 2\\ln ( t - t_c)\\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 .",
    "this integral relation has three critical points @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the first one gives non physical results , while the second one leads to @xmath25 for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "for this last case , @xmath26 .",
    "however , the fact that the evolution of the scale factor does not depend on @xmath0 makes this solution not very interesting .",
    "the third critical point of ( [ int ] ) leads to a particular solution in terms of power law function ( choosing @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 a more general solution may be obtained through integration of ( [ int ] ) .",
    "this has been done in @xcite , resulting in the general flat solutions @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 being another integration constant . since @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath33 may be identified with the initial time .",
    "the solutions presented above have the following properties . for @xmath34 , they reduce to @xmath35 while for @xmath36 , they take the form @xmath37    concerning the possible scenarios , the solutions have the following properties :    1 .   for @xmath38 :",
    "the universe has a decelerated expansion during all its evolution .",
    "2 .   for @xmath39 there are two regimes : 1 .   for the positive upper sign ,",
    "initially the universe has a subluminal expansion , followed by a superluminal expansion ; 2 .   for the negative lower sign",
    ", the universe has an accelerated phase during all its evolution .",
    "is the case ( 2.a ) that it will interest us .",
    "in such a case , the interpolation between a decelerated phase and an accelerated phase can be achieved .",
    "however , there is high price to pay in order to obtain such a simple qualitative realization of the accelerated expansion today without introducing any kind of exotic matter : the gravitational coupling is negative .",
    "in fact , the gravitational coupling is related to the scalar field @xmath6 by the relation @xcite @xmath40 hence , for @xmath41 , @xmath42 .    the most popular model to explain the current acceleration of the universe is the @xmath1 model .",
    "the matter content is a pressureless fluid and the cosmological constant . for a spatial flat case , the einstein s equation reduce to @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "this equation admits the solution @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the asymptotical behaviour are @xmath47 as expected , initially the scale factor describes a dust dominated universe , and later a cosmological constant dominated universe .",
    "we intend now to compare the background model for the flat pressureless fluid brans - dicke cosmology with the supernovae type ia data .",
    "this is made through the computation of the luminosity distance function , given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the value of the scale factor today , @xmath50 is the value of the scale factor at the time of the emission of the radiation , and @xmath51 is the co - moving radial distance . from now on ,",
    "we fix @xmath52 . with this normalization choice ,",
    "the scale factor at a given moment @xmath53 is related with the redshift @xmath54 by @xmath55 hence , the luminosity distance can be expressed as @xcite @xmath56    usually , the observational data are expressed in terms of the distance moduli given by @xmath57 in general the task now would consist in using the friedmann equation as @xmath58 where @xmath59 are the different matter components .",
    "if each of this component obeys a separate conservation equation , it can express as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the barotropic equation of state ( supposed to be constant ) defined by @xmath62 .",
    "using then the relation between the scale factor and @xmath54 , the luminosity function can be expressed as an integral over @xmath54 which depends on the density parameter today for each fluid .",
    "this procedure is detailed , for example , in reference @xcite .",
    "it must be remarked also that the expression ( [ mu0 ] ) must be modified for the case the gravitational coupling varies with @xmath54 , as reported in references @xcite .",
    "however , in the case we consider here , the local physics is supposed to be given by general relativity , the brans - dicke modifications intervening at cosmological scales only .",
    "hence , with this assumption , the expression ( [ mu0 ] ) may be still used safely .    for the brans - dicke cosmological model presented in the previous section the procedure outlined above becomes impossible to be applied due to the non - minimal coupling between gravity and the scalar field .",
    "but , we can use the relation @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the emission time for the source at the redshift @xmath54 and @xmath65 is the present time , together with the normalization condition @xmath66 . the expression ( [ g1 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath67 the present time may be determined through the definition for the hubble parameter @xmath68 evaluated for today , @xmath69 , when @xmath70 , this leads to the expression @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath9 being one of the parameters to be determined .",
    "hence , the luminosity distance is given by , @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the integration variable .",
    "the same procedure is used for the @xmath1 model described in the end of the previous section .    in order to compare with the supernovae data , the ( dimensionless ) time @xmath75 of emission",
    "must be determined from the expression for the scale factor and the relation between the scale factor and the redshift . in the case of the @xmath1 model",
    ", there are two parameters : @xmath9 and @xmath76 ( or equivalently , @xmath77 ) . in the brans - dicke model , there are in principle three free parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath78 and @xmath9 . however , we first inspect the best value for @xmath78 , and then we vary the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath9 around this parameter .",
    "the best fitting are obtained for @xmath79 : other values leads to an universe that accelerates too early or too late .",
    "hence , in both models , we are left with two free parameters .",
    "we use the supernovae type ia `` gold sample '' , with 157 high redshift supernovae , described in reference @xcite ( see also reference @xcite ) .     in the @xmath1 model . ]     in the @xmath1 model . ]     in the @xmath1 model . ]     in the @xmath1 model . ]     in the @xmath1 model . ]     in the @xmath1 model . ]",
    "the main quantity to be evaluated is the @xmath80 function , which gives the fitting quality : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the predicted theoretical value for the @xmath83 supernova , @xmath84 its observational value and @xmath85 the error bar , taking already into account the effect of peculiar dispersion . from this quantity , a probability function",
    "is obtained : @xmath86 where @xmath31 is a normalization constant .",
    "the probability function for a unique parameter can be obtained by marginalizing on the remaining one : @xmath87    in figures @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath12 the two dimensional probability distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath9 , as well as the one - dimensional probability distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath9 , in the brans - dicke flat model , are displayed .",
    "the most probable value for @xmath0 is @xmath90 , exactly the limiting case for the validity of solutions ( [ g1 ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath91 represents the case where the brans - dicke theory is conformally equivalent to the einstein s theory .",
    "hence , the prediction should more properly stated by saying that the most probable value for the brans - dicke parameter is @xmath92 . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the most probable value is @xmath93 .",
    "the best fitting for the brans - dicke flat model is given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 , with @xmath96 .    in figures",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 the two - dimensional probability for @xmath99 and @xmath9 and the one - dimensional probability function @xmath99 and @xmath9 , in the case of the @xmath1 model , are displayed .",
    "for @xmath9 , the prediction is quite similar to the brans - dicke case : the most probable value , marginalizing over @xmath99 , is @xmath100 .",
    "the most probable value for the dark matter density parameter , marginalizing over @xmath9 , is @xmath101 .",
    "the best fitting for the @xmath1 model is given by @xmath102 and @xmath100 with @xmath103 .",
    "the brans - dicke flat model gives a fitting slightly ( but not negligible ) better than the @xmath1 model .",
    "the general solutions for the brans - dicke flat cosmological model , determined by gurevich et al , predict a late time accelerated universe for @xmath41 , with an initial decelerated phase .",
    "this solution can be a candidate to describe the observed universe . in the present work",
    ", we have constrained this brans - dicke flat model using the supernovae type ia `` gold sample '' .",
    "we have compared the results with those obtained in a simplified @xmath1 model .",
    "the brans - dicke model leads to a slightly smaller @xmath80 ( which characterizes the quality of the fitting of the observational data ) with respect to the @xmath1 model .    in both models ,",
    "the predicted value for the hubble parameter @xmath9 is around @xmath104 .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the estimation of @xmath9 coming from the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation , which leads to @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "however , this seems to be a general feature of the estimation of @xmath9 using supernovae data and cmb data @xcite . for the brans - dicke model ,",
    "the best value for the parameter @xmath0 is around @xmath106 .",
    "it must be remarked that the case @xmath91 implies that the brans - dicke theory is conformally equivalent to general relativity .",
    "the minimum value for @xmath80 is obtained for @xmath95 and @xmath107 , with @xmath108 . in the @xmath1 case , the best fitting",
    "is obtained with @xmath102 and @xmath100 , with @xmath103    the results reported here indicate that , from the point of view of the supernovae type ia data , the brans - dicke cosmological flat model leads to a quite viable scenario , even if the generalization to the non - flat cases should be made in order to have a more complete statistical analysis .",
    "however , at this point , this model must be seen as essentially a toy model , mainly due to the negative value for the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it would be interesting to connect the brans - dicke model exploited here with effective actions in four dimensions coming from m - theory and f - theory , which predict also a negative value for the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the main problem with this scenario is that the values of @xmath0 are largely outside the values obtained with local tests , which indicate @xmath109 @xcite . in reference @xcite ,",
    "indications for a negative @xmath0 have also been obtained . moreover , the range @xmath41 implies a negative gravitational coupling @xcite .",
    "these drawbacks can be , in principle , circumvented if the gravitational coupling is scale - dependent , as suggested by considering quantum effects @xcite . in the present work , we made no attempt to reconcile the values for @xmath0 deduced from local tests with the corresponding values deduced from the analysis performed here .",
    "but , evidently , this problem must be addressed in order to have a complete realistic scenario .",
    "one important point to be signed is that previous study indicate that structures can form in the brans - dicke model considered here during all the evolution of the universe , after the radiative phase , even the gravitational coupling is , at large scale , repulsive @xcite .",
    "however , a more detailed comparison between the theoretical predictions for matter agglomeration and the observational data must be made in order to constraint more strongly the model . in special , the possibility that the model can be unstable due to the repulsive gravitational coupling",
    "must be verified @xcite .",
