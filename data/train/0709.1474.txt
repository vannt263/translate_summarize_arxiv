    "the dependence of the star formation rate on gas density on large scales is a subject of intense observational and theoretical investigation , as it is both an important input for models of galaxy formation and evolution and chemical evolution calculations , as well as a critical test for theories of interstellar medium evolution and star formation .",
    "let us define the surface density of the star formation rate , @xmath2 , as the mass of gas being converted into stars per unit time per unit surface area , and @xmath3 as the total gas mass per unit surface area .",
    "the two quantities have been found to obey a non - linear , power - law relation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 for a large range of surface densities and system morphologies .",
    "this correlation is known as the kennicutt - schmidt law of star formation ( schmidt 1959 , kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "the star formation law has been established through observations of the global star formation and gas density in different galaxies ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 , misiriotis et al .",
    "2004 , komugi et al .  2005 ) ; of local gas and star formation densities in different galaxies ( e.g. wong and blitz 2002 , boissier et al  2003 ) ; and of local gas and star formation densities within a single galaxy ( e.g. misiriotis et al .",
    "2006 in the case of the milky way , schuster et al .",
    "2007 in the case of m51 ) .",
    "traditionally , this correlation has been interpreted in the literature as a result of the density dependence of the star - formation timescale .",
    "the star formation rate density can be expressed as a ratio of the density of the gas available for star formation over a timescale relevant to the conversion of the available gas to stars .",
    "examples of such timescales that have been suggested in this framework are the free - fall timescale , the turbulence crossing time over the scale height of the galaxy , the collapse timescale of large expanding shells with low mach number ( see e.g. elmegreen 2002b and references therein ) , the orbital timescale of the galactic disk ( silk 1997 ) , and the timescale for gas accumulation along magnetic flux tubes parallel to spiral arms , into the valleys created by the magnetic rayleigh - taylor ( parker ) instability ( see e.g. shu et al . 2007 ) .",
    "these timescales _ all _ scale as the inverse square root of density , resulting in an overall scaling of the star formation density as gas density to the @xmath0 .",
    "a more elaborate treatment based on the same principle was presented by krumholz and mckee ( 2005 ) .",
    "this interpretation of the star formation law is very tempting because it is conceptually simple and elegant , and because it gives the same result for several different processes which may be controlling the star formation timescale .",
    "however , a series of more recent observations have indicated that this simple picture may not be a complete interpretation of the star formation law .    first of all , the value @xmath6 , although consistent with observations of a large range of star - forming systems , is by no means unique .",
    "appreciable scatter exists that can not be entirely attributed to observational uncertainties and can not be comfortably reconciled with a theoretically set single value of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , if only gas with local volume densities representative of molecular cloud cores is included in the gas surface density ( as is the case when tracers sensitive to higher density gas are used , such as hcn ) the resulting scaling is closer to linear , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the surface density of the denser gas , and @xmath10 is now closer to @xmath11 rather than @xmath0 ( e.g. gao and solomon 2004 , wu et al .",
    "observations of dwarf galaxies on the other hand seem to favor much steeper scalings ( values of @xmath7 much larger than @xmath0 ) .",
    "for example , de blok and walter ( 2006 ) find for ngc 6822 a slope 2.04 ; heyer et al .  (",
    "2004 ) find for m33 a much steeper slope , equal to 3.3 ; in the case of ic10 , leroy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , find a slope of @xmath12 for molecular gas and a slope much steeper than @xmath0 for the total gas density ( see their fig .",
    "in addition , since star formation is an inherently local phenomenon , the connection between the small scales ( @xmath13 ) where stars form , and the large scales ( @xmath14 ) that the gas density observations and the associated timescales refer to , may be quite complicated .",
    "the traditional interpretation implicitly assumes that a meaningful mean density can be assigned to the large scales where @xmath3 is determined .",
    "however , this need not be the case . as a counter - example , we can consider the situation where several dense objects are sparsely distributed over a region of @xmath15 dimensions .",
    "the mean density we would derive would be rather low , but it would not be representative of _ any _ object in the region .",
    "consequently , the star - formation timescale calculated at that mean density would not represent the real timescale over which any of the objects in the region evolve . instead , the relevant timescale for star formation should be constructed out of the densities of the individual star - forming sites rather than the large - scale mean density .",
    "finally , the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a highly complex system , and its structure and properties are the result of a synthesis of nonlinear phenomena and instabilities , not necessarily connected with one another .",
    "star formation on the other hand only occurs at the density peaks of the ism , and it is likely that the star formation law may be conveying information about the connection between the large - scale low - density ism and its small - scale high - density peaks , rather than information about the star formation process itself .    the connection between the high - density and low - density ism gas is imprinted in different incarnations of the star formation law .",
    "observations have established that the slope of the scaling of the star formation rate surface density with the gas surface density depends on the minimum density of the gas accounted for in observations [ eqs .",
    "( [ law ] ) and ( [ sfrvsdense ] ) ] .",
    "if now we demand that eqs .",
    "( [ law ] ) and ( [ sfrvsdense ] ) _ both _ hold , this implies a scaling between the surface densities of total gas and dense gas , @xmath16 with @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate this connection , and we examine the extent to which such a nonlinear scaling of the dense gas surface density with the total gas surface density can be interpreted as a topological property of the ism . in particular , we investigate whether such a scaling can arise naturally in _ multifractal _ topologies .    while fractal structures are characterized by a _",
    "unique _ non - integer generalized dimension , a _ spectrum _ of generalized fractal dimensions is required to fully describe multifractal structures . in a multifractal structure",
    ", we can define a scaling exponent which characterizes the structure locally , around each point .",
    "sets of points that share the _ same _ scaling exponent constitute a fractal .",
    "the distribution of fractal dimensions of all such fractals is the multifractal spectrum , which describes the distribution of geometries present in a complex structure .",
    "the gas and dust in the ism is organized in complicated structures with irregularities present over a wide range of scales .",
    "different studies have used different techniques to quantify the properties of these structures and describe the geometry of the ism : e.g. , autocorrelation function ( dickman and kleiner 1985 ) , power spectra ( sttzki et al . 1998 ) ; perimeter / area relation ( bazell and desert 1988 ; scalo 1990 ; vogelaar and wakker 1994 ; westpfahl et al.1999 in hi for members of the m81 group ) , wavelet analysis ( langer et al .",
    "1993 ) , principal component analysis ( heyer and schloerb 1997 ) , multifractal scaling ( chappell and scalo 2001 ) .",
    "these studies find that structure in the ism has a scale - free , hierarchical appearance .",
    "this complexity over a wide range of scales has lead to the proposition that a multifractal ism geometry with a lognormal probability density function ( pdf ) is consistent with many of the observed features , including the mass and size distribution of clouds and the ism filling factor ( elmegreen 2002a ; elmegreen et al .",
    "the physics is usually associated with compressible turbulence ( e.g. , mac low and klessen 2004 , scalo and elmegreen 2004 ) , however the multifractal scaling is much more generic and may arise from many different multiplicative hierarchical processes ( e.g. colombi , bouchet , and schaeffer 1992 ; sylos labini and pietronero 1996 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the ism can not be strictly scale - free , since optical observations of a variety of galaxies suggest an upper characteristic scale ( @xmath181 kpc ) that can either be the jeans length ( e.g. elmegreen 2004 ) or the wavelength of the parker instability ( mouschovias , shu and woodward 1974 ) .",
    "a lower characteristic scale also exists , at the order of @xmath180.1 pc ( blitz and williams 1997 ; barranco and goodman 1998 ; goodman et al .",
    "however , in between these scales , a variety of different processes and instabilities can lead to multifractal scalings and lognormal pdfs ( e.g. vazquez - semadeni 1994 ; kravtsov 2003 ; wada & norman 2007 ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to examine whether a nonlinear scaling of the dense gas surface density with the total gas surface density similar to that of eq .",
    "( [ densdens ] ) can arise naturally in multifractal ism geometries , whether it is robust enough to resemble the persistence and uniformity of @xmath19 over a variety of star forming systems with different local conditions , and whether it can allow for different slopes seen e.g. in observations of dwarf galaxies under physical conditions similar to those found in these systems .    a geometrical explanation to eq .",
    "( [ densdens ] ) has an additional tantalizing potential consequence . equation ( [ sfrvsdense ] ) implies that the star formation rate surface density scales linearly with the very dense gas , or , equivalently , that at those high densities the star formation timescale is roughly constant and independent of @xmath20 : @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "however , in this case @xmath23 and if @xmath24 due to geometry , then @xmath25",
    ". the observationally motivated assumption of a star formation timescale independent of @xmath26 at high densities , in combination with a topologically - driven scaling between dense and total gas , can thus provide a geometrical interpretation of the star formation law itself .",

    "this distribution is quantified by the pdf , which is defined as the distribution of volume fraction with respect to local density ( where the local density is measured in units of the mean density of the cube ) . in order to have a nonlinear scaling between the surface densities of total gas and gas density peaks ,",
    "the pdfs of different patches within the cube _ must _ be different from each other .",
    "this requirement is straight forward to prove .",
    "let the local pdf within a patch @xmath35 of volume @xmath43 be @xmath44 .",

    "it is this effect which is the origin of the nonlinearity in the scaling of @xmath20 with @xmath3 .",
    "a similar dependence of the local pdf on the mean density was pointed out by kravtsov ( 2003 ) in the case of cosmological simulations , where the star formation law was reproduced in large scales , despite the fact that the local star formation recipe featured a timescale _ constant _ with density .",
    "we have demonstrated that a nonlinear scaling between very dense and total gas surface densities arises naturally in multifractal geometries , and we have traced its origin in the property of the local multifractal pdf to extend to higher local densities in regions of higher mean density . however , there are still several points to be addressed before we can draw conclusions on how robust this scaling really is , and how it may relate to the star formation law .",
    "these points are the following .    1 .",
    "the definition of `` dense gas '' we used in our discussion of fig . [ fig1 ] was rather arbitrary .",

    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "although the maximum density achieved in the multifractal cube is a useful first tool to discern the trends in the slope of the @xmath9-@xmath3 relation , a better quantity that can be used to characterize the properties of the multifractal is the width of the global pdf . as can be seen by comparing the upper and the lower panels of fig .",

    "there are observational indications that the value of @xmath7 ( and thus of @xmath53 ) depends on @xmath65 .",

    "it is tantalizing that if we do accept these two assumptions , many properties of the star formation law are recovered naturally .",

    "the steepening of the star formation law in dwarf galaxies ( de blok and walter 2006 ; heyer et al .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thus , in this framework , both the universality of the law , as well as deviations from it under certain conditions and in specific systems , have a uniform interpretation as effects of the geometry of the ism .",
    "because multifractal geometries are the ubiquitous outcome of the combined effects of a variety of nonlinear processes such as the ones shaping the scalings of the ism , this interpretation is not based on any assumption about _ which _ energy inputs and dynamical processes dominate in ism physics .",
    "conversely , reproduction of the star formation law by any ism model can not be on its own regarded as an indication that the model is a complete or accurate description of ism dynamics ; rather , it indicates that the model succeeds in reproducing a multifractal geometry with a wide enough pdf from which the star formation law comes about as a natural outcome .",
    "the connection between a lognormal pdf and the star formation law has been suggested by elmegreen ( 2002b ) , however in this case a complicated dependence of the efficiency on density above the threshold was also introduced , in contrast to our work , where no such dependence is either assumed or found to be necessary .",
    "results from cosmological simulations ( kravtsov 2003 ) also point in the direction of the star formation law arising from lognormal pdfs with a constant small - scale star formation timescale , consistent with the picture suggested by the observations of gao & solomon ( 2004 ) and wu et al .",

    "a roughly constant timescale for high - density gas can be attributed to star formation being a threshold phenomenon , in the sense that stars form only out of gas in the high - end tail of the pdf which exceeds some threshold in local volume density .",
    "observationally , this concept is supported by studies of the local environments of protostars , which are always found in the densest parts of molecular clouds , the dense molecular cloud cores ( e.g. enoch et al .  2007 ) . once the local volume density exceeds some value such that gravity overtakes the forces supporting the star - forming cloud , the dense gas collapses to form stars within a timescale corresponding to the threshold density .",
    "the nature of the relevant threshold and associated timescale depends on the relative dynamical importance of different forces in star - forming clouds .",
    "for example , in magneticly supported clouds , the threshold ( that needs to be reached through ambipolar diffusion ) is the critical mass - to - flux ratio , while the relevant collapse timescale once the threshold is exceeded is the magnetically diluted dynamical timescale ( see e.g. reviews by mouschovias 1987 , 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "if magnetic fields are not dynamically important , the relevant timescale ( free - fall time ) is very similar ( see e.g. vazquez - semadeni et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "although these timescales depend on local density , they have a fixed value @xmath70 at the threshold , and this may be the origin of the gao and solomon ( 2004 ) result .    even if the detailed local conditions in individual molecular clouds ( magnetic field , mach number distribution ) differ so that the threshold density , as well as the associated star formation timescale at the threshold , differ as well , the star formation law will not be affected as long as the variations are not too large . the threshold density for star formation",
    "is determined by the structure of the molecular cloud cores ( at scales of @xmath71 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath20 is determined by the masses , numbers , and _ distributions _ of these cores within their large - scale environment ( @xmath72 ) , rather than their density structure . as a result ,",
    "the star formation threshold density and @xmath20 are independent quantities .",
    "consequently , @xmath73 will also be independent of @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , variations in @xmath73 will increase the scatter of the scaling between @xmath2 and @xmath74 but it will not change its slope . as long as the variations and the associated scatter are not so large that the scaling is lost , the star formation law would not be affected .",
    "krumholz and thompson ( 2007 ) have argued that the reason behind the gao and solomon ( 2004 ) findings is that the gas density tracer used in the particular study is sensitive to only a very narrow range of densities , which corresponds to a specific dynamical timescale value , while the star formation timescale in general does depend on the density , so sampling a wide density range results in the nonlinearity of the star formation law .",
    "although this explanation may reconcile the traditional picture with observations of @xmath7 between @xmath75 and @xmath0 , it can not account for values",
    "_ greater _ than @xmath0 , such as those suggested by observations of dwarf galaxies .",
    "our analysis was performed , as a first step , for a three - dimensional cube , rather than a disc geometry which would be more intuitive and natural for the description of star - forming galaxies . as a result , the length along the line of sight of the cube fragments over which surface densities were averaged were generally larger than their plane - of - the - sky dimensions .",
    "on the other hand , in observations quoted here , the line - of - sight length of the regions studied were generally comparable to their plane - of - the - sky dimensions .",
    "we have tested that the dependence of our scalings on the plane - of - the - sky size of the `` patches '' we have used is minimal .",
    "however , we plan to return to this problem in a more detailed analysis for different ism geometries in the future .    we should finally note that in our models , the multifractal properties are set by the mass fractions @xmath30 . in turn",
    ", the values of @xmath30 represent a parametrization of the shape of the multifractal pdf .",
    "the values of @xmath30 for the specific models discussed in this work were chosen so as to represent a variety of pdf shapes appropriate for a range of possible ism geometries .",
    "the correspondence of specific pdf shapes to particular astrophysical systems is left to be investigated through simulations and observations .",
    "observations of the scaling of @xmath2 with the surface density of gas of different local volume densities indicate that a nonlinear scaling also exists between the surface densities of very dense gas ( traced e.g. by hcn ) and total gas in star - forming galaxies , @xmath76 . in this paper",
    ", we have explored the possibility that this nonlinear scaling may arise as a result of the multifractal topology of the ism .",
    "we have investigated the properties of this scaling in simulated multifractal cubes , the geometrical properties of which are characterised by the values of the mass fractions @xmath30 that each cell inherits from its parent cell and the number of levels of refinement , @xmath33 .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows .    * a nonlinear scaling between the surface densities of very dense gas and total gas",
    ", @xmath77 is a natural property of multifractal geometries .",
    "the slope @xmath53 of the scaling generally depends on the minimum density of the gas that is considered as `` very dense '' , and tends to increase as this minimum density increases .",
    "however , this trend does not continue indefinitely , and @xmath53 saturates to some value once the `` very dense gas '' threshold becomes higher than about one order of magnitude above the mean density . *",
    "the saturation value of @xmath53 depends on the width of the global pdf .",
    "the saturation slope decreases as the width of the pdf increases , but again this trend is not continued indefinitely , and the saturation slope settles to a value between @xmath63 for pdfs with full - width at half - maximum larger than about 2 decs in density .",
    "the robustness of this scaling for wide multifractal pdfs is reminiscent of the universality of the scaling slope @xmath7 ( @xmath78 , see eq .",
    "[ densdens ] ) of the star - formation law .",
    "* the origin of the nonlinearity of the @xmath79 scaling is the property of the local pdfs to extend to higher volume densities as the total surface density increases .",
    "this variation in spread between local pdfs is an intrinsic property of multifractal geometries . * with the additional assumption that , at very high densities , @xmath73 is roughly constant and independent of @xmath9 ( consistent with observations by gao and solomon 2004 and by wu et al .",
    "2005 ) , a geometrical interpretation of the @xmath79 can be extended to the star formation law itself . since in this case @xmath80",
    ", we immediately obtain @xmath81 .",
    "it is intriguing that in this framework two assumptions ( multifractality of the ism and roughly constant @xmath73 at very high densities ) are sufficient to explain many different features of the star formation law , including the robustness of the @xmath0 slope across different systems and morphologies , the increase of the slope in dwarf galaxies , and the decrease of the slope when tracers sensitive to higher densities ( e.g.  co ) are used .",
