    "supersymmetric ( susy ) grand unification has long been considered to be a very attractive paradigm for physics beyond the standard model since it solves the gauge hierarchy problem and leads to coupling unification while at the same time providing a candidate for dark matter .",
    "the discovery of neutrino masses has added an extra appeal to them since understanding small neutrino masses via seesaw mechanism requires the seesaw ( or @xmath7 ) scale close to the scale of grand unification ( or gut scale ) @xcite .",
    "gut theories based on @xmath1 @xcite are just right for this purpose since they unify all fermions of each generation including the right - handed ( rh ) neutrino , needed in the seesaw mechanism ( and no extra fields ) into a single spinor representation .",
    "it also provides a spontaneous origin of p ( @xmath8parity ) and cp violations .",
    "furthermore , it was pointed out some years ago that there is a class of renormalizable susy so(10 ) models @xcite that use * 10 * and * 126 * higgs fields contributing to fermion masses which have a small number of parameters in the yukawa sector and can therefore be quite predictive for neutrino masses and mixings , making them testable using neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we focus on a sub - class of these models in this paper .",
    "it is well known that there are two kinds of seesaw contributions to neutrino masses in so(10 ) models : the type i seesaw contribution @xcite which uses heavy right handed neutrinos whose masses arise from @xmath7 breaking and type ii seesaw @xcite which uses a heavy sm triplet higgs field , in both cases with masses close to the gut scale . because of their predictive power , a large number of susy @xmath1 models with * 10 * and * 126 * higgs fields have been constructed over the recent years using type - i or type - ii dominance , or a mixture of both @xcite . of these models , the ones that assume",
    "type ii seesaw dominance @xcite stand out for a very special reason that the diverse mixing patterns between quark and lepton sectors at low energies are explained from the fact that the bottom and tau masses become nearly equal near the gut scale @xcite and without any need for additional symmetries .",
    "these models also automatically predict a `` larger '' @xmath0 @xcite which seems to be indicated by recent data @xcite .",
    "they have since been the focus of many investigations @xcite and have clearly defined a distinct approach to the quark - lepton flavor problem .",
    "an immediate question for this class of models is whether type ii domiance is indeed consistent with the constraints of grand unification . in this paper",
    ", we will discuss this question . to define the issue clearly , we note that the neutrino mass formula in generic so(10 ) models has the form m_= fv_l  -,[seesaw ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 the mass of the triplet higgs field .",
    "the first term in the above expression is the type ii seesaw term whereas the second is the type i contribution .",
    "note that strictly speaking the type ii term has the form @xmath11 ; however , to keep the self energy contribution to the mass of the * 15 * -plet ( or the triplet higgs ) of the same order as @xmath12 , it is natural to require @xmath13 , which then gives the form for the type ii term in eq.[seesaw ] . in minimal renormalizable so(10 )",
    "models of the type in @xcite , the coupling matrix @xmath14 that determines the relative sizes of the two contributions also contributes to charged fermion masses and is therefore constrained by fits to the quark and lepton masses as well as the ckm mixings .",
    "detailed numerical fits @xcite show that its largest element has the value @xmath15 making the type - i seesaw term dominate .",
    "this would apparently suggest a serious tension between type ii seesaw dominance and grand unification and this issue must be resolved before models with type ii seesaw dominance can be taken seriously .",
    "first attempt at solving this problem was made in @xcite , where it was noted that the following two conditions prove sufficient for a solution to this problem :    * \\(i ) @xmath1 breaks to sm in two stages with @xmath1 first breaking to @xmath2 at a scale much larger than the canonical gut scale e.g. @xmath16 gev .",
    "this makes @xmath17 larger making the type i term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) smaller than the type ii term which is independent of @xmath18 . + * \\(ii ) without upsetting grand unification , the complete multiplet @xmath3 of @xmath2 containing the left - handed ( lh ) triplet @xmath19 is made lighter with masses around @xmath20 gev .",
    "these two conditions can be successfully implemented in susy @xmath1 models @xcite if the higgs system consists of * 10 * , * 126 * , * 54 * and a * 210 * fields .",
    "this puts the neutrino mass discussions that use type ii dominance on sound theoretical footing .",
    "a second scenario which also resolves this problem has been given in a more recent paper @xcite .",
    "the question we investigate here is : what happens to type ii seesaw dominance in theories without supersymmetry or with high scale susy breaking and in particular , is it compatible with coupling unification @xcite .",
    "we are motivated to look at this question by the fact that lower limits on some of the superpartner masses keep going up at lhc with no trace of supersymmetry anywhere else and also that neither coupling unification nor seesaw mechanisms per se depend on the existence of supersymmetry .    the first challenge in implementing the above two conditions in a non - susy so(10 ) framework is that coupling unification is known not to work for sm field content and therefore two step unification of the type we are contemplating , will have to require new physics below the gut scale .",
    "secondly while adding additional fields to restore coupling unification , one must not run into conflict with proton decay constraints . in this paper , we isolate two classes of models where the above strategy works : ( i ) non - susy so(10 ) models with extra fermions and an extra higgs doublet at the tev scale and a su(5 ) * 15 * -plet at an intermediate scale and ( ii ) a split - susy model @xcite where susy is broken at a much higher scale than tev scale .",
    "the particular models we present here lead to a proton life time that may be accessible in planned experiments such as hyperk @xcite , when they probe proton life time above @xmath21 yrs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec . 2 and sec . 3",
    ", we outline the non - susy and split - susy frameworks where two step so(10 ) breaking with type ii seesaw dominance is realized ; in sec.4 , we discuss fermion mass fits in these models . in sec . 5",
    ", we present our conclusions .",
    "as noted , one way to establish type - ii seesaw dominance in non - susy gut so(10 ) is to consider the symmetry breaking pattern so(10 ) ^m_u^(10 ) su(5)^ m_u^(5 ) sm , [ chain ] where the higgs representations @xmath22 and/or other multiplets along with @xmath23 implement the first step of breaking .",
    "the right - handed ( rh ) triplet @xmath24 higgs in @xmath25 carrying @xmath26 through its high scale vev @xmath27 generates right - handed neutrino mass to drive type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "if this scale is much larger than the canonical gut scale of @xmath28 gev , type i contribution to neutrino masses will be small . to achieve precision gauge coupling unification in this case",
    ", we will clearly need new tev scale fields . in this example , we choose the non - standard tev scale particles from the well known mssm spectrum minus its superpartners i.e. ( 2,-1/2,1 ) , f_(2,1/2,1),f_(2,-1/2,1 ) , f_(3,0,1 ) , f_b(1,0,1),f_c(1,0,8 ) , [ add ] where @xmath29 s denote fermions .",
    "this spectrum may be recognized to be the same as in split - susy models @xcite except for the additional presence of @xmath30 . in the split - susy case",
    "discussed later we show how the tev - scale spectrum of eq.([add ] ) with a second higgs doublet can be realized . in non - susy",
    "@xmath1 the non - standard fermions of eq.([add ] ) can be shown to originate from the adjoint and vectorial matter representations , @xmath31 and @xmath32 of @xmath1 from gut - scale lagrangian by suitable tuning of parameters @xcite where the @xmath33 representation has also been added .",
    "once the fermions are made light they could be protected by corresponding global symmetries like a @xmath34 discrete symmetry group e.g. matter parity , @xmath35 , under which all standard fermions ( higgs scalars ) are odd ( even ) . in the context of non - susy @xmath1",
    "all fermions in eq.([add ] ) have even parity . at around @xmath36 gev",
    ", we add the @xmath2 * 15 * -scalar representation to implement the type ii seesaw mechanism . using the sm particle masses and",
    "@xmath37 tev and @xmath38 tev , the resulting precision unification of gauge couplings in the non - susy theory occurs close to the mssm gut scale with @xmath39 gev and @xmath40 and the unification scale is identical to the direct breaking of so(10 ) in @xcite .",
    "the departure from the well known mssm gut scale , @xmath41 gev has arisen because of our choice of tev scale masses and the requirement of better precision in gauge coupling unification than the mssm .",
    "we treat this as the non - susy @xmath2 unification scale . in the next step by tuning the gut - scale parameters in the higgs potential",
    ", we make all components of the higgs representation @xmath42 to remain at the scale @xmath43 gev , as noted .",
    "being a complete representation of @xmath2 , the introduction of all its components with degenerate masses at the lower scale does not change the unification scale , @xmath39 gev , although now we have @xmath44 .",
    "this pattern of gauge coupling unification is shown in fig.[fig1 ] which satisfies the desired condition for type - ii dominance .",
    "the @xmath45 gauge boson mediated decay width for @xmath46 can be expressed as @xcite ( pe^+^0 ) & = & ( ) a_l^2|_h^2(1+d+f)^2[a_sr^2+a_sl^2 + & & ( 1 + |v_ud|^2)^2].[width ] in eq.([width ] ) @xmath47 represents degenerate mass of @xmath48 superheavy gauge bosons and @xmath49 is their coupling to quarks and leptons ( @xmath50 ) at the gut scale @xmath51 . here",

    "@xmath59 represents the ckm- matrix element @xmath60 for quark mixings .",
    "the @xmath61 operator when evolved from the gev scale , short - distance renormalization factor from @xmath62 turns out to be @xmath63 and the long distance renormalization factor is @xmath64 .",
    "these are estimated using values of gauge couplings in the relevant mass ranges , the anomalous dimensions and the one - loop beta - function coefficients .",

    "p^0= 6.310 ^ 35   yrs . , which is nearly 62.4 times longer than the current experimental limit and may be accessible to measurements by next generation proton decay searches .",
    "however two - loop effects combined with threshold effects from tev - scale spectrum , and the type - ii seesaw scale in addition to small gut - threshold effects @xcite are likely to bring the predicted lifetime within the accessible range of future searches @xcite .",
    "as was noted in the original split - susy paper @xcite , the absence of the second higgs doublet @xmath72 of eq.([add ] ) in split - susy models distorts the one - loop precision unification .",
    "here we suggest a way to restore precision unification which can be applied to all such split - susy models .",
    "the ultimate gut scale theory in this model is supersymmetric . at first",
    "we carry out fine tuning in the gut - scale superpotential @xcite to have two higgs doublets at the weak scale : one with mass in the hundreds of gev range and a second one with mass in the tev range .",
    "these two doublets can arise in @xmath1 models with two * 10 * fields at the gut scale .",
    "the rest of the tev scale spectrum is as in the split - susy models i.e. fermionic partners of higgs fields and gluons .",
    "the super - partners of these fields are considered to be at @xmath73 gev and the @xmath2 * 15 * -plet and its conjugate fields are at @xmath36 gev , in the figure 2 below .",
    "we vary these scales later to study its effect on grand unification .",
    "they then lead to coupling unification as in fig 2 below with @xmath74 and @xmath75 at @xmath76 gev and @xmath77 gev , respectively .    primarily due to increase in the gut - gauge coupling , the proton lifetime for @xmath78 reduces by nearly @xmath79 compared to the prediction in the non - susy case leading to _",
    "^ 35   yrs.[sptaup ] although this prediction could possibly be probed by the next generation experiments @xcite , the situation could be more promising once two - loop and threshold effects are taken into account since they could pull this value downward e.g.in @xcite .",
    "we have derived the above prediction for the susy scale of @xmath73 gev .",
    "as we bring the susy scale downward ( upward ) the predicted lifetime decreases ( increases).in particular we find that while the gut scale would remain unchanged , the inverse fine structure constant at the gut scale changes with @xmath80 for @xmath81 tev @xmath82 gev .",

    "3 . for @xmath84 tev the predicted lifetime @xmath85 which is nearly 20 times longer than the current experimental limit , is clearly accessible to future searches for the decay mode @xmath78 .",
    "as is well known , fitting fermion masses in gut theories starts with an extrapolation of known low scale masses to the gut scale .",
    "this will depend on the nature of the theory from tev scale to gut scale .",
    "we perform this bottom - up extrapolation using the one - loop renormalization group equations @xcite suitably modified for the model of sec . 2 where there is no susy till the gut scale with the tev scale spectrum of eq.([add ] ) and the scalar * 15 * -plet at @xmath86 gev .",
