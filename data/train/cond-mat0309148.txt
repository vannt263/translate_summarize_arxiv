    "equilibrium and non - equilibrium relaxational dynamics play an important role in many critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "typically , relaxational flows drive the evolution of the system to the equilibria determined by a lyapunov energy functional @xmath0 that depends on local potential functionals and on the interactions in the system  @xcite .",
    "the celebrated @xmath1 functional is a paradigmatic example of such a potential functional and gives rise to well - known equilibrium models such as the so - called model a ( a coarse - grained version of the ising model ) , and model b ( an archetype of phase separation dynamics ) , among others  @xcite .",
    "typical relaxational models describe the flow of a field @xmath2 defined on a @xmath3-dimensional square lattice via a langevin equation of the form @xmath4 here @xmath5 labels a lattice site , @xmath6 is a positive constant , @xmath7 denotes the entire set of fields , and @xmath8 are gaussian white noises with zero mean and correlation functions @xmath9 typically , the functional @xmath0 consists of a local potential @xmath10 and an interaction term , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coupling coefficient .",
    "the left - most sum in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) runs over all lattice sites and the right - most sum over the @xmath13 nearest neighbors of a given site @xmath5 .",
    "a keystone in this formalism is the link ( the `` fluctuation - dissipation relation '' ) between the intensity @xmath14 of the fluctuating contribution and the relaxation parameter @xmath6 through the constant @xmath15 that in equilibrium systems is proportional to the temperature .",
    "the relaxation coefficient @xmath6 affects how fast the system relaxes to the global steady state .",
    "recent studies have revealed the importance of field - dependent relaxation coefficients @xmath16 in the dynamics of these systems  @xcite .",
    "a generic description for such systems is provided by the langevin equation @xmath17 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\xi_i(t ) , \\label{phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath18^{1/2}$ ] are both positive .",
    "for example , it has been shown that relaxational flows driven by field - dependent coefficients may present _ inverted phase diagrams _ where ordering effects increase with the intensity of the fluctuations .",
    "this behavior has been observed in polymer mixtures where spinodal decomposition , i.e. , phase separation , increases with increasing temperature  @xcite .",
    "the importance of these flows may be even more pronounced in nonequilibrium systems , and goes well beyond the scenarios that lead to inverted phase diagrams .",
    "one example is that of pure noise - induced phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "such phase transitions exhibit the striking feature that noise is the _ crucial _ element responsible for the appearance of ordered phases that disappear in the absence of noise .",
    "the first mechanism identified in the literature leading to such behavior  @xcite relied on a combination of the so - called stratonovich drift that arises under this particular interpretation of the noise , and collective effects .",
    "the stratonovich drift in these systems leads to opposite dynamical responses at short and long time scales .",
    "collective effects generated by the coupling among the field elements can amplify short time instabilities ( that would die away in the absence of coupling ) , thus leading to the observed noise - induced phase transitions . as a consequence , there was originally a widespread belief that noise - induced phase transitions could only be found in systems where there are no noise - induced transitions  @xcite , since the latter transitions occur in zero - dimensional ( uncoupled ) systems .",
    "recent studies involving relaxational flows with field - dependent relaxation coefficients have shown otherwise by presenting a system where both a transition ( zero - dimensional ) and a phase - transition ( coupled systems ) are induced by the same source of noise  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mechanism is not attributable to the stratonovich drift because these transitions occur independently of the noise interpretation  @xcite . moreover , the same mechanism has been extended to pattern formation phenomena  @xcite , generalizing a previous mechanism based on the stratonovich drift  @xcite .",
    "a thorough understanding of relaxational models driven by field - dependent coefficients is therefore important for a number of reasons .",
    "they play a relevant role in critical phenomena , they may explain situations where inverted phase diagrams are obtained , and they constitute a generalization of the seminal work of horsthemke and lefever on noise - induced transitions to noise - induced phase transitions in coupled systems .",
    "whereas specific non - equilibrium relaxational models driven by field - dependent coefficients have been considered in the literature , herein we present a more general analysis of such models , whereby the specific cases considered earlier become part of a broad panorama .",
    "we ask two questions : ( 1 ) what are the circumstances ( features of the model , values of the control parameters ) that lead to purely noise - induced phase transitions ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the nature of the phases that can occur in these systems , and what are the features of the model that determine these phases ? in answering these questions , we discuss the possible phase diagrams that can be obtained and show that their overall structure depends on geometrical properties such as the balance of convexities of the local potentials and of the field - dependent coefficients .",

    "however , both lead to the same value of the order parameter @xmath43 .    at this point , we must make a distinction between _ solutions _ and _ phases _ as determined by the stability of the former .",
    "we call a _ disordered _",
    "( _ d _ ) phase a macroscopic state where @xmath44 is the _ only _ stable solution .",

    "since the solution of the self - consistency equation  ( [ mf2 ] ) determines the acceptable values of @xmath41 , it is crucial to understand the behavior of @xmath40 as a function of @xmath47 . noting that @xmath48 and applying the generalized schwarz inequality @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , one concludes that the right hand side of eq .",
    "is positive , and therefore @xmath40 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath52 .",

    "we exclude `` runaway '' systems that do not fall into this category .",
    "with fig .  [ f1 ] in mind , consider now the possible resulting behaviors of the order parameter as we transition from one phase to another by changing a control parameter .",
    "note that the general model   ( as well as the mean field version of the model ) depends on only two parameters , the coupling coefficient @xmath12 and the noise intensity @xmath15 , so the control parameter that characterizes a change from one phase to another could be either of these two ( or some combination of them ) .",
    "the question then is how the points of intersection in fig .  [ f1 ] move as one varies a control parameter that takes the system from the behavior shown in one panel to that shown in another .",
    "consider the transition as a system moves from the behavior shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] to that of panel ( b ) .",
    "the way this is expected to occur is that the solid curve rotates upward so that in addition to the @xmath44 solution , another solution emerges at the origin .",

    "the transition between the disordered and ordered phases is continuous in the order parameter ( second order phase transition ) .",
    "a transition from panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] to panel ( c ) would involve the evolution of a kink in the curve that first cuts the diagonal at the origin and then moves upward toward the existing cut .",
    "associated with this there is a change in the curvature of @xmath40 near the origin .",
    "this transition is sketched in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , where we show the two nonzero solutions moving closer together as the control parameter increases .",
    "the transition between the ordered and multistable phases is discontinuous ( first order phase transition ) and is expected to exhibit hysteresis .",
    "the discontinuity is clearly apparent , for example , in the jump from the disordered branch of the multistable phase as one decreases the control parameter and this branch becomes unstable .",
    "finally , a transition from panel ( a ) to panel ( c ) , the bottom panel of fig .  [ f2 ] , again involves a change in the curvature near the origin and the evolution of a kink that first touches the diagonal at a single nonzero value that then separates into two as the control parameter increases .",
    "the transition between disordered and multistable phases is again discontinuous .",
    "note that all of these transitions can also proceed in the opposite direction than illustrated here , e.g. a transition from order to disorder would occur as in the top panel but from right to left .",
    "we stress that the transitions between disordered and ordered phases are continuous in the order parameter ( second order phase transitions ) , whereas the transitions from or to multistable phases are discontinuous ( first order ) and are therefore expected to exhibit hysteresis .",
    "there may be singular isolated exceptions to this latter conclusion , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "a more quantitative characterization of the phase transitions is possible for those transitions that involve a change in the stability properties of the @xmath60 solution , that is , for phase transitions between disordered and ordered phases , and between ordered and multistable phases ( i.e. , the top and middle panels in fig .",
    "this characterization involves the first two nonzero derivatives of @xmath40 with respect to @xmath41 in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "the first derivative provides information about the slope of @xmath40 and the third about the concavity / convexity ( @xmath40 is an odd function of @xmath41 , so even derivatives around the origin vanish ) .",
    "transitions between disordered and ordered phases ( second order ) occur when @xmath61 transitions between ordered and multistable phases ( first order ) occur when @xmath62 in turn , these derivatives can be expressed in terms of the cumulants of the probability density @xmath63 .",
    "we proceed to establish this relation .    since @xmath40 is an odd function of @xmath41 , its taylor expansion around the solution @xmath46 reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 furthermore , a straightforward but tedious calculation leads to the result @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath68 cumulant of the probability distribution @xmath69 .",
    "the relation of the cumulants to the statistical moments of the probability distribution is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 indicates the determinant of the @xmath72 matrix , @xmath73 the binomial coefficients , and @xmath74 stands for statistical averages over the probability density @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , around @xmath76 the self - consistency equation reads , @xmath77 and it then follows that @xmath78    in summary , the boundaries between disordered and ordered phases and between ordered and multistable phases are characterized by the first two nonzero cumulants of the probability distribution @xmath69 as follows : @xmath79 transitions between disordered and multistable phases can not be characterized in this fashion since they require information about @xmath80 away from @xmath81 .",
    "having discussed the possible phase transitions that might be observed in the mean field system - , we now ask which particular phases might be present for particular values of the control parameters @xmath12 and @xmath15 . in this section",
    "we present an analytic deduction of the phases present for small and for large values of the coupling coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "the behavior for intermediate values must be deduced on the basis of plausibility arguments that we introduce later .",
    "we start by defining @xmath82 this quantity measures the differences in the slopes of @xmath83 and @xmath84 as a function of @xmath83 near the origin . according to the analysis presented in the previous section , @xmath85 for an ordered phase and @xmath86 in either disordered or multistable regions of the phase diagram .",
    "moreover , the phase boundaries to or from ordered states are given by the zeros of @xmath87 .",
    "note that @xmath88 , that is , @xmath89 in the absence of coupling .",
    "thus , @xmath38 is the only possible solution to the self - consistency equation  ( [ mf2 ] ) in the small coupling limit , and the system is disordered in this limit . _ at sufficiently weak coupling the system is therefore always disordered . _    one can easily check that @xmath90 thus , as @xmath12 grows from zero the system advances toward the ordered phase .",
    "this statement does not mean that the system will actually enter into the ordered phase as the coupling increases ; it simply states the ordering role of weak but increasing coupling .    on the other hand and",
    "more interestingly , it is possible to investigate the strong coupling limit as follows .",
    "we first introduce the convenient notation @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "we can then write all the non - zero moments of @xmath93 as @xmath94 .",

    "we are not able to provide a general quantitative analysis except to note that if @xmath136 , the system is always in a disordered ( _ d _ ) phase since the fluctuations are needed to provide the energy to induce symmetry breakings .    despite this difficulty",

    "the system becomes more ordered as the noise intensity increases_. in the case of @xmath128 this behavior is associated with the destabilization of multistable phases and in general suggests that the phenomenon of the so - called _ inverted phase diagrams _ depends mainly on the convexity of the local potential around the origin .",
    "it is also worth noting the phenomenon of reentrant noise - induced multistability for the case @xmath138 .",

    "the stationary probability density now is @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the normalization constant and @xmath149 is the _ _  effective _ _ potential , @xmath150 the equilibria of the effective potential are given by the condition @xmath151 , that is , @xmath152 the stability of the equilibria depends on the sign of the second derivative of the potential at the equilibrium points .",
    "a noise - induced transition occurs when there is a change in the stability of the solution @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the boundary of stability is given by @xmath154 , that is , @xmath155    note that @xmath156 is always a solution of eq .",
    "( [ equi ] ) and therefore the disordered solution is stable if @xmath157 this equation corresponds exactly to the stability boundary associated with eq .",
    "( [ g2 ] ) . in other words , _ the strongly coupled system behaves exactly as the uncoupled system_. in the cases @xmath158 and @xmath159 the critical value of the noise intensity that changes the stability of the disordered solution to an ordered one is exactly as calculated in the coupled system , @xmath160 .",
    "moreover , our purpose in analyzing the zero - dimensional system is also to understand the phase boundary that separates multistable and disordered phases in the case @xmath137 in the spatially extended problem .",
    "recall that in that case the stability of the disordered solution does not change , and therefore we are not able to use our mean field analysis near the disordered state to compute phase boundaries .",
    "however , we can use eqs .",
    "( [ equi ] ) and to support our numerical findings that indicated that there is a critical noise intensity separating those two phases . while solving eq .",
    "( [ equi ] ) for solutions @xmath161 is rather cumbersome and eq .",
    "( [ esta ] ) does not have an analytic solution for those values , it is trivial to solve the problem numerically .",
    "the result agrees perfectly with our previous findings : there is an asymptote at @xmath144 ( it@xmath29 ) that corresponds to the critical value of the noise intensity separating disordered and multistable phases .",
    "to check the predictions of the mean field theory we present numerical simulations of eq .",
    "( [ phi2 ] ) in a two dimensional square lattice with nearest neighbor interactions , the it@xmath29 interpretation of the noise , and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we focus on the case @xmath137 .",
    "this is the most interesting , previously unexplored , case : a striking effect of the noise , a noise - induced multistable phase and an inverted phase diagram , occur in this case .",
    "note that the case @xmath139 has been studied recently  @xcite , the case @xmath140 presents a phase diagram with a phenomenology similar to the well - known model a  @xcite , and the case @xmath138 presents as its main feature the same striking phenomenology of noise - induced multistability as does the case @xmath137 .",
    "figure [ f7 ] shows the order parameter @xmath43 as a function of the noise intensity @xmath15 for a fixed value of the coupling constant , @xmath162 .",
    "the system is seen to explore the three possible phases , disordered , multistable , and ordered , as the fluctuations become stronger .",
    "moreover , the system presents an inverted phase diagram where order becomes more prominent as the noise is increased . as indicated by the discontinuous behavior of the order parameter ,",
    "the phase transitions are first order in all cases . to detect the multistable phase and the associated hysteresis , we integrated eq .",
    "( [ phi2 ] ) under two different conditions .",
    "the initial conditions and the noise realizations are identical in both cases .",
    "a difficulty in such simulations is that it takes an inordinately long time to reach a steady state ( eventually the system leaves any steady state if the system is finite , but this time can be made as long as desired by increasing the size of the system ) . to overcome this difficulty , in one case we added a very small external field that favors the solution @xmath24 while in the other we added one that favors an ordered solution .",
    "as soon as steady states were reached , the external fields were turned - off .",
    "the insets of fig .",
    "[ f7 ] show , by means of a density plot , the values of the field in the multistable phase for the points _ a _ and _ b _ for which @xmath163 . the scale of the density plots is also presented and is the same for both insets .",
    "the insets highlight the striking feature of the noise - induced multistability and show the two possible states within the multistable region .",
    "we have presented a detailed studied of phase transitions in models with field - dependent relaxation coefficients . by means of a mean - field approximation in combination with other analytical techniques and plausibility arguments supported by particular examples , we have elucidated the phase diagrams that can be found in such models .",
    "we stress that our methods can easily be applied to a variety of other systems .",
    "moreover , we have demonstrated that disorder - multistability continuous phase transitions are singular points in the phase diagram , and that the phases for large values of the coupling are determined by geometrical features of the local potential and of the field - dependent coefficient in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "we have also showed that the behavior of the extended system at large values of the coupling coefficient is equivalent to the behavior of the uncoupled zero - dimensional system .",
    "therefore , the mechanism responsible for the phase transitions is similar to the noise - induced transitions _ a la _ horsthemke - lefever , and is not attributable to the stratonovich drift together with collective effects involved in other noise - induced phenomena  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have performed numerical simulations of a particular case to check the results of the mean - field approximation .",
    "the numerical results are in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions and reproduce the main features of the system , most notably , the occurrence of noise - induced multistability , and of an inverted phase diagram indicating that stronger noise induces greater order .",
    "we envision further modifications of these models that would extend the richness of the observed phenomenology . in particular , including other degrees of freedom and considering different couplings increases the complexity of the multistability phenomena caused by the noise .",
    "further degrees of freedom could , for example , lead to _ locking _ of the system either in an oscillatory mode ( limit - cycle ) or in a stationary state ( focus ) depending on the initial conditions .",
    "considering couplings that favor morphological instabilities could lead to pattern formation determined entirely by the initial conditions .",
    "work in these directions is in progress .",
    "this work was partially supported by the engineering research program of the office of basic energy sciences at the u. s. department of energy under grant no .",

    "in fig .  [ f2 ] and the discussion surrounding it we noted that with the exception of singular points in the parameter space , phase transitions from disorder to multistability are first order ( discontinuous ) . in this appendix",
    "we expand on this assertion . by `` singular '' we mean that if there is a point @xmath164 in the phase diagram where a continuous transition between disorder and multistability exists , then no neighboring points in the phase diagram can present the same transition .",
    "in other words , continuous disorder - multistability phase transitions are _ isolated critical points _ in the phase diagram , and there is no plausible continuous function @xmath165 connecting them .    figure  [ f3 ] shows the behavior of the order parameter @xmath43 as a function of a control parameter in the vicinity of a continuous disorder - multistability phase transition .",
    "note that for that behavior to happen , all three roots of the self - consistency equation must vanish exactly at the critical value of the control parameter .",
    "moreover , the convexity of @xmath80 must also change sign at exactly that value .",
    "if such a critical point @xmath166 exists , it must satisfy the conditions @xmath167 these requirements fulfill the schwarz inequality , eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) , and we must therefore conclude that such a critical point is possible .    now , assume the existence of the critical point @xmath168 .",
    "we investigate the requirements for a neighboring point @xmath169 to also be associated with a disorder - multistability phase transition .",
    "a straightforward calculation leads to the following condition to be satisfied by @xmath170 , @xmath171 this can in general only be satisfied if @xmath172 . as for @xmath173",
    ", it must satisfy @xmath174 again , the only acceptable solution to this equation is @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , if there exists a critical point in the phase diagram where a continuous disorder - multistability phase transition occurs , that point is singular in the sense that it is isolated .",
    "note that the present analysis is also applicable to equilibrium models with @xmath176 , which leads to to the so - called gaussian model when @xmath177 and to model a if the local potential is @xmath178 ."
