    "studying polarizable and magnetizable materials , one central question concerns the electromagnetic force on matter .",
    "this is especially true for liquids ( such as ferrofluids  @xcite ) , as these respond not only to the total force , but also to the spatially varying force density . in principle",
    ", one may take the lorentz force as an exact microscopic expression and coarse - grain it to obtain the macroscopic force  @xcite , @xmath0 unfortunately , this is of little practical value , as we neither have , nor indeed are interested in , the detailed microscopic information of the fields @xmath1 . on the other hand , although we do have the knowledge of the coarse - grained fields @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , or may obtain them via the macroscopic maxwell equations , it is clear that the difference between the above true expression and the  fake \" lorentz force , @xmath6 may become quite important : think of an iron nail in a magnetic field , which is obviously subject to an electromagnetic force , although the  fake \" force vanishes , as @xmath7 .    the difference between the true and fake lorentz force",
    "is frequently taken to be the kelvin force , being @xmath8 in the electric case  @xcite , where @xmath9 denotes the polarization , with summation over repeated indices implied .",
    "originally , the formula was microscopically derived : first write down the force exerted by an external field on a dipole , eg by taking the derivative of the electrostatic energy with respect to the position of the dipole for given field .",
    "then , assuming that the dipoles are too far apart to interact , and to feed back to the given field , take the total force density as simply the sum of all forces exerted on the dipoles in a unit volume .",
    "clearly , this result neglects nonlinear terms in @xmath9 ( which account for interaction ) and is valid only in the dilute limit .",
    "this implies small polarization and therefore weak force , and one is free to add a second order term , writing the kelvin force as @xmath10 there is a more sophisticated macroscopic derivation of the kelvin force that we shall discuss next .",
    "stating that the same constraint applies here , and one may still write the kelvin force either as @xmath11 or as @xmath12 is bound to raise a few eyebrows . but as will be shown in this review , it is really a rather straight - forward implication of the assumptions made during its derivation . by the same token , for linear constitutive relation ,",
    "the kelvin force is only valid for small susceptibility , @xmath13 , to linear order in @xmath14 .",
    "the same holds for the magnetic case , where the corresponding force is much larger in praxis ( as it is not subject to ionization or residual conductivity ) .",
    "the kelvin force expression is again valid only when weak , to linear order in the magnetization @xmath15 , or the magnetic susceptibility @xmath16 . and one may take its expression either in the usual form  @xcite , as @xmath17 or equally justified , as @xmath18 . consequently and remarkably , the kelvin force is not usually a valid formula in ferrofluids , where frequently @xmath19 and @xmath20  though it is widely employed there .",
    "the nowadays generally accepted method to derive the electromagnetic , or  ponderomotive \" force @xmath21 , cf  15 of _ electrodynamics in continuous media _ by landau and lifshitz  @xcite , is a definit improvement over the microscopic one given above .",
    "it is completely macroscopic and starts from identifying @xmath22 as @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the macroscopic maxwell stress tensor , and @xmath25 the zero - field pressure  the pressure that is there for given temperature and density , but without the external field .",
    "the ponderomotive force @xmath22 reduces to the kelvin force , if the polarization and magnetization are ( assuming the dilute limit ) proportional to the density @xmath26 .    the idea behind the identification seems attractively simple : since @xmath27 is the total force on a volume element , and @xmath28 the force at zero field , their difference @xmath22 must be the force due to the external field . unfortunately , as we shall show in this review , the resultant force is rather ambiguous .",
    "the reason lies with the zero - field pressure @xmath25 , which is not a unique quantity , because its value depends on the chosen variables , eg @xmath29 @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the entropy density .",
    "the conventionally defined kelvin force is valid only under isothermal conditions with the density kept constant . under adiabatic conditions , with @xmath31 given , the temperature @xmath32 is known to change with the field , so will @xmath25 , the alleged zero - field pressure .",
    "any field dependence implies that @xmath25 contributes to the electromagnetic force .",
    "employing the force of eq  ( [ a5 ] ) alone then leads to wrong predictions .    in physics",
    ", we tend to start from a robust base of broad applicability when studying a given situation , narrowing our focus along the way only when necessary .",
    "clearly , while the universally valid lorentz force is one such base , the fragile ponderomotive force , and even more specific , the kelvin force are not .",
    "this makes it desirable to look for better alternatives , one of which is employing the maxwell stress tensor directly .",
    "given in terms of thermodynamic variables , the maxwell tensor is an unequivocally macroscopic , coarse - grained quantity .",
    "it holds for all conceivable systems and is subject only to the validity of local equilibrium  a constraint in frequency but not in the type and strength of interaction . besides , more frequently than not , in understanding the many facets of strongly polarizable systems , it is more convenient to employ the maxwell tensor directly , rather than to follow the detour via pressure and the ponderomotive force @xmath22  in spite of having to deal with quantities such as the chemical potential or the entropy .",
    "given the maxwell tensor s pivotal role for a solid understanding of electromagnetism in condensed systems , ( not least as the starting point for forces ) , it is especially unfortunate that one is hard pressed to find a fully convincing derivation of its form .",
    "the classic reference is again to the otherwise excellent book by landau and lifshitz  @xcite , the relevant  15 of which , however , leaves many readers unconvinced , even confused .",
    "the reasons for this are presented in the four sections below .",
    "the three more obvious reasons for the frustration of the readers are ( i ) the gradient terms , ( ii ) the magnetic field dependence , and ( iii ) the concentration : first , the maxwell tensor is derived considering a capacitor .",
    "its geometry is so simple that terms proportional to the gradients of temperature and field may have been missed .",
    "although these are asserted to be negligible in a footnote , one feels the need for convincing arguments .",
    "second , the magnetic terms are obtained , in  35 of  @xcite , by the replacement @xmath33 , @xmath34 . this would be justified if the system under consideration does not contain sources , and the respective maxwell equations are the same , @xmath35 , @xmath36 versus @xmath37 , @xmath38 . in the geometry",
    "used to derive the electric part of the stress tensor , however , the charge on the capacitor plates is essential for producing the electric field . therefore , an independent consideration for the magnetic part is necessary , with a current carrying coil replacing the charge laden capacitor . in ",
    "4 of his widely read book on ferrofluids  @xcite , rosensweig points to this gap , and aims to fill it .",
    "unfortunately , the calculation starts from a faulty assumption , discrediting the derivation , cf section  [ mag ] .    finally , neither landau and lifshitz nor rosensweig study the concentration dependence of the stress tensor , although it is an important thermodynamic and hydrodynamic variable in ferrofluids , liable to undergo much greater variations than the density , and hence of experimental importance .",
    "next , the lack of any discussion on the range of validity for the obtained expression further undermines the trust of the readers .",
    "the derivation is thermodynamic in nature and takes place in a stationary capacitor , so the result is apparently valid only in equilibrium and for vanishing liquid velocity .",
    "consistent to this , the static maxwell equations for the rest frame are repeatedly employed when deriving the electromagnetic force from the maxwell tensor .    nevertheless , it is customary to take for granted that the form of the maxwell tensor and the electromagnetic force thus derived also hold in dynamic situations , at finite frequencies and nonvanishing liquid velocity .",
    "this may well be approximately true for some circumstances , but which and why",
    "? should we not rather derive dynamically valid expressions for the maxwell stress tensor and the electromagnetic force , and justify the employed approximations by estimating the magnitude of the terms neglected ?      then there is a technical flaw that actually renders the derivation mathematically invalid : there is no question that one can always obtain a tensorial quantity @xmath39 by evaluating the scalar @xmath40 while varying the unit vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "taking each of the two unit vectors to successively point in all three directions , we obtain nine different results for @xmath43 , each a component of @xmath39 . in  @xcite",
    ", @xmath42 is the surface normal , @xmath41 the direction of the virtual displacement , and the maxwell tensor @xmath44 is denoted as @xmath45 .    with the electric field being the only preferred direction , @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "need to be both along and perpendicular to the field . in",
    " 15 of  @xcite , only the displacement of the capacitor plate is considered , implying that the surface normal @xmath42 is kept parallel to the e - field throughout . therefore ,",
    "if the direction of the electric field is taken as @xmath46 , only the components @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 could have been evaluated .",
    "a footnote states : _ it is not important that in this derivation @xmath50 is parallel to * n * , since @xmath51 can obviously depend only on the direction of @xmath50 , not on that of @xmath52 .",
    "_ this is incorrect , because although @xmath51 does not depend on * n * , the scalar @xmath53 does : take for instance the term @xmath54 , which is part of the maxwell stress , and which indeed does not depend on @xmath52 . yet with @xmath55 , we have @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 if @xmath59 .",
    "finally , there are conceptual problems of more fundamental nature .",
    "the maxwell stress tensor is introduced in @xcite by the terse sentences : _ it is well known that the forces acting on any finite volume in a body can be reduced to forces applied to the surface of that volume .",
    "this is a consequence of the law of conservation of momentum . _",
    "the surface force density is subsequently taken as the stress tensor .",
    "momentum conservation is without further elaboration a confusing argument , because the very idea of force is something that alters the momentum of particles .",
    "being accelerated by external fields , the momentum of a lump of material is not conserved , and there is no reason why the momentum density @xmath60 should satisfy a continuity equation .",
    "on the other hand , what the electromagnetic field does is to _ exchange _ momentum with the material , so the total momentum of both remains conserved , which is , as we shall see , @xmath61 .",
    "this momentum density does satisfy a continuity equation , @xmath62 .",
    "( even in the presence of fields that accelerate particles , the total system  including particles and the field producing charge carriers  is still translational invariant , with the associated total momentum a locally conserved quantity , see  75 of  @xcite , ch 14 of  @xcite , and  @xcite . )",
    "the negative of the associated momentum flux , @xmath63 , is the properly defined , dynamically valid maxwell tensor .",
    "it holds its ground for finite frequencies , nonvanishing velocities of the medium , and including dissipations .",
    "understanding the conservation of @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 renders the derivation of the maxwell tensor cogent and coherent , even though the second term is , under usual circumstances in condensed matter , much smaller than the first .",
    "our aim in this paper is a careful and rigorous derivation of the maxwell tensor and the dynamically valid electromagnetic force , in a presentation that is detailed and pedagogical .",
    "we also consider applications , especially for experimentally relevant situations in ferrofluids , to give hands - on illustrations on how to employ these quantities .",
    "the paper may be divided into two parts , the first consists of chapter [ gene ] and concentrates on the fundamental concepts .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations for a dense system exposed to electromagnetic fields  including especially the form of the maxwell tensor  are derived here . the second part ( chapter [ gene2 ] and [ exp ] ) is more practically concerned .",
    "it starts from the maxwell tensor , derives the electromagnetic force , considers different simplifications , and studies a number of experimentally relevant situations .",
    "although we believe that chapter [ gene ] provides useful and necessary insights , the second part could if necessary be read alone .    chapter [ gene ] starts by differentiating two types of theories : first , the high - resolution theory for a low density system , with at most one particle per infinitesimal volume element , or per grain ( as in photographs ) ; second , the low resolution theory for a high density system , with many particles per grain . the microscopic maxwell equations and",
    "the newtonian equation of motion ( including the lorentz force ) belong to the first type .",
    "there are no hidden charges , polarization or magnetization here , and we know the whereabouts of every single particle .",
    "the second type is represented by the macroscopic maxwell equations , or any thermodynamic and hydrodynamic theories .",
    "the question about the coarse - grained form of the electromagnetic force arises here .",
    "we shall consider three systems with increasing densities , to be accounted for by theories of decreasing resolution and increasing complexities : the first system ( section  [ high ] ) is a dilute gas of charged particles , which is well accounted for by the newtonian equation of motion and the microscopic maxwell equations .",
    "the next system ( section  [ part ] ) is a slightly dissociated liquid of particles possessing negligible electric and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "so there are many particles , but at most one charge carrier , per grain .",
    "the appropriate theory here is of a mixed type , being a combination of the hydrodynamic theory and the microscopic maxwell theory .",
    "the former accounts for all particles , the latter accounts for the spatially slowly varying field , either externally imposed or produced by the few charge carriers .",
    "finally , in section  [ eom ] , we consider a dense system , including dipole moments and hidden sources . it is to be accounted for by the genuinely low - resolution ,",
    "hydrodynamic - type maxwell theory that is our goal to derive and consider in details .",
    "in all these systems , there are a conserved energy @xmath67 and a conserved momentum density , @xmath68 , both consist of material and field contributions .",
    "these we shall choose as two of our dynamic variables , with the equations of motion @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath63 is the maxwell stress tensor .",
    "we shall obtain explicit expressions for @xmath71 and @xmath72 in all three systems  whereby finding the expressions in the genuinely dense , third medium is rendered very much simpler , and more transparent , by the considerations in the previous two dilute systems .    in chapter",
    "[ gene2 ] , starting from the maxwell tensor , we shall first obtain the general expression for the electromagnetic force density , valid for arbitrarily strong fields , moving medium and finite frequencies , given essentially by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the chemical potential .",
    "although this expression is already valid without field , it is the proper formula for the quantity usually written as the sum of the zero - field pressure gradient and the ponderomotive force .",
    "in contrast to the latter , however , @xmath73 is valid for any sets of variables , and for arbitrarily large polarization and magnetization .    in equilibrium , since both the temperature @xmath32 and the chemical potential @xmath74 are uniform , this force density is identically zero .",
    "nevertheless , electric and magnetic fields remain operative , may lift a polarizable system off the ground , deform its shape and generally alter its hydrostatics  all signs that forces of electromagnetic origin are at work . in section [ surff ] ,",
    "the responsible equilibrium force is identified as a surface force .",
    "its form follows directly from the simplifications that occur for the maxwell stress if the system is in equilibrium ( section [ mse ] ) .",
    "as most of the experiments considered in chapter [ exp ] reflect varying appearances of the equilibrium force , this is a useful and concise result .",
    "a thermodynamic rederivation of the maxwell stress tensor is given in section  [ ener ] , an approach which is similar in spirit to that of landau and lifshitz  @xcite , yet carefully freed of the flaws listed in section [ mst ] above . in comparison to the derivation given in chapter [ gene ] , this here is narrower in focus and validity , but simpler .",
    "chapter  [ gene2 ] ends with section  [ mn ] , which points out the inherent ambiguity of the zero - field pressure @xmath25 , as it is independent of external fields only if @xmath32 and @xmath26 are kept constant .",
    "we stress this point by repeating the separation of the zero - field pressure from the maxwell stress for various combinations of variables , obtaining many forms of the ponderomotive force , all rather different from each other .",
    "furthermore , a warning is issued on the unsuspected , narrow range of validity for various expressions in the notation containing the zero - field pressure , especially the maxwell stress in the approximation @xmath75 , and the kelvin force .",
    "neither is valid for large magnetization and magnetic susceptibility , @xmath76 and @xmath20 .    the very useful magnetic bernoulli equation by rosensweig  @xcite is unfortunately also given in this notation .",
    "an formulation free of ambiguity is found , along with the generalization to include the variation of concentration .    in chapter  [ exp ]",
    ", we study a number of phenomena typical of strongly polarizable systems .",
    "most of these experiments have already been given detailed theoretical analyses , especially by rosensweig in his comprehensive book on ferrofluids  @xcite .",
    "the reason to repeat them here is threefold : first , to demonstrate that it is not necessary to introduce the zero field pressure , that experimental phenomena may be well and easily accounted for employing the maxwell stress directly , using a generally valid , unambiguous notation .",
    "second , we believe that our derivations are well streamlined and easy to follow .",
    "this is achieved by stressing the simplification of equilibrium , and by consistently using only the maxwell stress and the associated boundary conditions .",
    "in contrast , confusingly many pressures are deemed necessary in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we aim to amend some of the physics and especially include the concentration of magnetic particles as an independent variable .",
    "being inhomogeneous where the field is , the concentration alters experimental outcomes and is something theoretical considerations need to include .",
    "since mesoscopic particles diffuse slowly , the equilibrium between concentration and field gradient needs time ( up to days , even weeks ) to establish .",
    "so for times much briefer , the concentration will remain constant and may indeed be taken as dependent . on the other hand , strong gradients , small geometry , large particles",
    "will all considerably shorten the equilibrating time ( down to fractions of a minute ) , then the spatially varying concentration will be an important feature in any system . besides , long contacts with field gradients are also of interest ( eg in magnetic o - rings ) .",
    "although the non - uniform equilibrium distribution of magnetic particles is not a well studied subject , their diffusion under enforced non - equilibrium situation is , see  @xcite .    now a rundown of the considered experiments . in section  [ denva ] , we study the variation of density and concentration in the presence of inhomogeneous fields : while the variation of density is a measured phenomenon , that of the concentration is not  although its variation is much more pronounced , by many orders of magnitude",
    ". a vertical , current - carrying wire that goes through a dish containing ferrofluid will drag up the ferrofluid along the wire .",
    "our calculation in section  [ vccw ] includes the surface tension and the variation of concentration .",
    "the following section  [ levi ] considers how far an external field will raise the level of a fluid column , and what a pressure gauge actually measures within the ferrofluid that is subject to external fields . section  [ scrap ] deals with rather similar physics and considers magnetic o - rings and scrap separation .",
    "section  [ elli ] contains a simple calculation on the elliptical deformations a droplet of ferrofluid undergoes along the external magnetic field .",
    "there are two points we shall not address in this article .",
    "first , we shall not consider any dissipative terms , although the framework presented here is well suited for including them .",
    "this was a difficult decision , as the dissipative terms account for irreversibility , without which no macroscopic , coarse - grained theory is complete , and because they give rise to additional electromagnetic forces of comparable magnitude and experimental relevance . yet , including these terms would have considerably lengthened an already lengthy article , and further complicated its formulas and arguments .",
    "we pledge amendments for the future , and for now direct the impatient readers to the literature  @xcite .",
    "second , given the long and tortuous history of the struggle to come to terms with the macroscopic electromagnetic force , time and again forcing us to back up from blind alleys , any attempt by us on a comprehensive citation would bear historic rather than scientific interests . as we see it , the consistent thermodynamic treatment given first by landau and lifshitz  @xcite , and later generalized to include nonlinearity by rosensweig and others  @xcite , cf the excellent summary by byrne  @xcite , is so much more superior than the many treatises preceding them , that this represents the only worthwhile starting point for any further considerations  and consequently these two are also the only ones subject to scrutiny and criticisms here",
    ".      this paper will be in the si units throughout , though with a little twist to render the display and manipulation of the formulas simple .",
    "we define , and from now on shall extensively use , the fields and sources @xmath77 where ( again starting from here ) the quantities with hats are the usual ones , denominated in mksa , or the si - units .",
    "the advantage is , all new fields have the same dimension , @xmath78 , and sensibly , @xmath79 and @xmath80 in vacuum . ( electric charge @xmath81 has the dimension @xmath82 , and its density @xmath83= \\sqrt{\\rm j / m^5}$ ] . ) written in the new fields , all formulas are rid of the ubiquitous ( and content - free ) factors @xmath84 and @xmath85 . to return to the more familiar mksa - fields _ at any instance _ , simply employ eqs  ( [ hat ] ) .",
    "( these fields are sometimes referred to as being in the heaviside - lorentz , or the rational , units .",
    "but saying so immediately leads to heated and pointless discussions .",
    "we stick to the si units throughout and use the above fields only as a convenient shorthand that may be abandoned whenever one chooses . )",
    "some literature , notably  @xcite , employs cgs , or _ gauss_-units . to ease comparison with them ,",
    "simply note that the _ gauss_-fields , with tilde , may be obtained any time via @xmath86",
    "we first consider a rarefied system of charged particles , and choose a resolution that is high enough that each grain ( or infinitesimal volume element ) contains one or less particles .",
    "( this theory is meant as a starting point , to clarify a few concepts important for the more complex theories of the following chapters .",
    "so we shall simply discard the possibility that even in a rarefied gas , two particles will occasionally come close to each other . )",
    "the microscopic maxwell equations account for the time evolution of the electromagnetic field for given sources , @xmath87 while the feedback of the field on the motion of the sources is given by the newtonian equation of motion , @xmath88 one for each particle @xmath89 .",
    "( to emphasize the fact that we are here dealing with the high - resolution , microscopically accurate fields , these are denoted by the lower case letters @xmath90 , while the coarse - grained fields below are denoted by the usual @xmath91 . )",
    "eqs  ( [ 1],[1a],[2 ] ) represent a conceptually simple and complete theory , but it contains a notational inconsistency : the maxwell equations are an euler type theory , accounting for the time evolution of fields at a given point in space , while the newtonian equation is of the lagrange type , which concentrates on a given particle .",
    "( so the term @xmath92 in eq  ( [ 1a ] ) denotes the electric current at a space point , while @xmath93 in eq  ( [ 2 ] ) is the velocity of a particle . )",
    "as only the euler formulation lends itself to a scaling - up of the grains and a reduction of the resolution , we shall first find the euler formulation for the newtonian equation , before using it to draw a number of conclusions useful for dense systems .",
    "since there is at most one particle per grain , of volume @xmath94 , we may identify the velocity , mass and charge of a volume element with that of the particle occupying it at a given instance , and take all three to be zero if there is no particle . as a result",
    ", we obtain three ( highly discontinuous ) fields : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "the many newtonian equations of motion then reduce to one field equation , @xmath98 = \\rho_e({\\bf e}+\\mbox{\\boldmath$v$}\\times{\\bf b}/c).\\ ] ] ( the quantity @xmath99 is to be taken from the velocity of the same particle at two successive moments . ) it is now essential to explicitly include the continuity equation , @xmath100 that in the lagrange version is implicit , nearly incidentally contained in the fact that one does not loose any of the many equations ( [ 2 ] ) . [",
    "the continuity equation for the charge density @xmath101 is implied by the maxwell equations eq  ( [ 1],[1a ] ) . ]",
    "the material contributions to the energy and momentum density are , respectively , @xmath102 where the first comprises of the rest energy and the ( non - relativistic ) kinetic energy . employing eqs  ( [ 3],[4 ] ) , we find @xmath103      the field contribution to the energy and momentum density are @xmath104 from the maxwell equations ( [ 1],[1a ] ) we deduce @xmath105 note the relationship @xmath106 .",
    "this is far from accidental and derives from the symmetry of the relativistic energy - momentum 4-tensor , @xmath107 , because @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "less formally , @xmath110 may also be seen as the conservation of the field angular momentum for @xmath111 .",
    "the angular momentum density @xmath112 is a locally conserved quantity in neutral systems . rewriting eq  ( [ 13 ] )",
    "( with @xmath111 ) as @xmath113 , we observe that the angular momentum @xmath114 satisfies a continuity equation only if the stress tensor is symmetric .",
    "although this argument seems to require merely the symmetry of the momentum 3-tensor , @xmath115 , we know that a nonvanishing @xmath116 in one inertial system will foul up the symmetry of the 3-tensor in other systems , as the antisymmetric parts of any 4-tensors mix in a lorentz transformation . yet angular momentum is conserved in every inertial system .",
    "since this reasoning is so general , it also holds for the material part , @xmath117 . hence the expression for the momentum density is actually @xmath118 $ ] , cf eqs  ( [ 5],[9 ] ) , though we are quite justified to neglect the second term in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "later , when we have no prior knowledge of the form of the momentum density , we shall deduce it from that of the energy flux , as angular momentum is also conserved in dense systems .",
    "we register the fact that while the expression for the energy density @xmath119 is a genuine input ",
    "independent of , and in addition to , the maxwell equations , the formula @xmath120 is not , since @xmath121 is given once @xmath122 is .",
    "the preceding two sections allow the simple and noteworthy conclusion that our starting equations imply local conservation of total energy , momentum and angular momentum even in the presence of charges , @xmath123 .",
    "taking @xmath124 and @xmath125 , we find @xmath126 these results have been collected here because local conservation of these quantities is always true , independent of the above derivation tailored to a dilute and finely resolved system .",
    "so we may start from them as input next .",
    "now we consider a dense macroscopic system in its hydrodynamic regime : to the above gas of dilute charge carriers we add a dense system of neutral particles with vanishing electric and magnetic dipole moments .",
    "one example of this composite system is a slightly ionized gas with negligible electric and magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this is still a comparatively simple system , as the highly resolving , vacuum maxwell equations ( [ 1],[1a ] ) remain valid  and with them every single of the equations of section  [ fiel ] , about the field contributions to energy and momentum . the equations in section  [ eule ] , about the respective material contributions , must be modified , as these will now be accounted for by three hydrodynamic variables : the entropy density @xmath31 , and the coarse - grained mass density @xmath127 and velocity @xmath128  all smooth and slowly varying fields .",
    "( the coarse - graining brackets are dropped below to retain the simplicity of display . )      the hydrodynamic theory of the material part of our system is given by two continuity and two balance equations , @xmath129 for @xmath111 , these are the well known hydrodynamic equations of a neutral , isotropic liquid  @xcite . for finite @xmath101 , the right sides of eqs  ( [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] ) have the given form because the field source terms of eqs  ( [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] ) remain unchanged , and because summing up the respective right sides must yield nil , such that total energy and momentum are conserved , as given in eqs([16 ] ) .",
    "( since @xmath130 actually denotes @xmath131 now , the above formulas presume the validity of @xmath132 , rather than the original eqs  ( [ 1a ] ) .",
    "this is justified , however , because charge carriers do move with @xmath131 in the absence of dissipation . )    comparing @xmath133 and @xmath134 here to those of eqs  ( [ 9 ] ) , the only apparent difference is the appearance of the pressure @xmath135 , clearly an expression of the present system being dense and interacting . however , there is more than meets the eyes , and the most important one is our ignorance about the explicit expression for the energy @xmath136 .",
    "( also , being a hydrodynamic , coarse - grained theory , the equations of motion now contain dissipative terms to account for irreversibility and entropy production .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , however , we shall neglect these in this article . )    in the co - moving , local rest frame of the liquid , ( denoted by the subscript @xmath137 , ) the material energy density in local equilibrium is given by the thermodynamic expression , @xmath138 which states the simple fact that @xmath139 is a function of @xmath31 and @xmath26 , with the temperature @xmath32 and the chemical potential @xmath140 defined respectively as @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "( the dimension of the chemical potential @xmath140 is energy / mass . )",
    "the explicit form of @xmath139 is usually unknown , it depends on microscopic specifics , and is in general rather complicated . yet , as we know from thermodynamics , and as we shall see below , eq  ( [ 21 ] ) is as such already very useful .",
    "the second of eqs  ( [ 5 ] ) , @xmath143 , remains an excellent approximation , because the energy flux @xmath144 as given by eq  ( [ add1 ] ) is still dominated by the term @xmath145 ( contained in @xmath146 ) , from the transport of rest energy .",
    "all the other terms are ( in comparison ) relativistically small and can be neglected .    in nonrelativistic physics ,",
    "it is customary to subtract @xmath147 from both sides of eq ( [ 21 ] ) , eliminating the rest energy from @xmath148 on the left , redefining the chemical potential as @xmath149 on the right , and at the same time subtracting @xmath150 from the energy flux @xmath133 , eq  ( [ add1 ] ) .",
    "this represents a shift to a different but equivalent set of independently conserved quantities : from @xmath136 and @xmath26 to @xmath151 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , this operation does alter the link between the momentum density and the energy flux , rendering it @xmath152 @xmath153 .",
    "we shall follow this convention , so @xmath139 and @xmath140 , starting from this section , no longer include the rest energy and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "to account for a liquid with a varying local velocity @xmath130 , we need to employ a globally valid  lab \"- frame .",
    "the material energy is then given as @xmath155 , where @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 .",
    "so the thermodynamic expression of eq  ( [ 21 ] ) becomes @xmath159 , with @xmath160 @xmath161 the chemical potential of the lab frame .",
    "clearly , this expression signals that @xmath162 is also a function of @xmath163 .",
    "if we are dealing with a solution , a suspension , or any system with more than one conserved densities , we need to replace the term @xmath164 with @xmath165 , introducing all conserved densities @xmath166 as independent thermodynamic variables , @xmath167 where summation over @xmath168 1 ,  2 ,  @xmath169 is implied .",
    "being conserved , all @xmath166 obey continuity equations , so the first of eqs  ( [ 26 ] ) is to be replaced by @xmath170 @xmath171 .",
    "usually , it is more convenient to retain the total density @xmath26 as a variable . for a binary mixture with the solute density @xmath172 and the solvent density @xmath173 , we therefore take @xmath172 and @xmath174 as the variables , implying that @xmath165 in eq  ( [ 23 ] ) is to be read as @xmath164 @xmath175 .",

    "the hydrodynamic theory is clearly necessarily written in these general and abstract quantities , and we may take this observation as an indication that the hydrodynamic theory contains no more input than conservation laws and thermodynamics , which is the basic reason of its general validity .",
    "we shall return to , and build upon , this point in the next section .    for a charged system , @xmath181 , we need to include the maxwell equations ( [ 1],[1a ] ) for a complete description .",
    "the independent variables now include @xmath182 and @xmath183 , each with an equation of motion .",
    "all equations also depend on @xmath101 , which however only stands for @xmath184 and is not independent .      for our purpose of deriving the genuine low - resolution maxwell theory , it is instructive to again change the notation to @xmath67 and @xmath185 by adding up the material and field contributions , as we did in section  [ cons ] .",
    "the new theory remains closed and complete , and is given by the maxwell equations  ( [ 1],[1a ] ) , the continuity equations  ( [ 26 ] ) for mass and entropy , and eqs  ( [ 16 ] ) for @xmath67 and @xmath186 , where the fluxes @xmath187 are obtained by adding the fluxes of eq  ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) to that of ( [ add1 ] ) .",

    ", we shall be dealing with a dense system containing hidden charges and dipole moments .",
    "this entails coarse - graining operations , of which the most obvious result is the appearance of four fields , @xmath194 , replacing the two here . for the remaining of this chapter ,",
    "however , we shall ignore this complication , while considering the less obvious , but not less important changes .    of these",

    "( we may of course expand @xmath122 in the low - field limit , and retain only the lowest order term , say @xmath195 .",
    "although this resembles the microscopic expression , @xmath196 , the coefficient @xmath197 is a function of hydrodynamic variables . )",
    "only @xmath198 @xmath199 retains a clear - cut significance , because it is conserved .",
    "this is relevant , as the form of @xmath200 was an important input of the electromagnetic part of our theory , cf the last paragraph of section  [ fiel ] . on the other hand",
    ", this is not an entirely new circumstance , as we did also loose the knowledge about the explicit form of @xmath136 when going over to the dense , second system , cf eq  ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "so we shall proceed in two steps .",
    "first , we reconsider the hydrodynamic theory of a neutral system to understand its derivation , especially how the ignorance about the energy was overcome .",
    "next , this method is generalized to include the @xmath201-fields",
    ". the result will be a low - resolution maxwell theory  except that two instead of four fields are considered , or the 2-field theory .    in equilibrium ,",
    "the entropy @xmath31 is a function of all the conserved quantities in the system , because these are the only ones that do not change when the system is closed . in our case ,",
    "the variables are @xmath202 . given some ( usually satisfied ) mathematical properties of @xmath203",
    ", we may rewrite this as @xmath204 , or eq  ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "[ note that , at this stage , we do not yet know the relation between @xmath205 and @xmath206 . ]",
    "as remarked in the last section , the hydrodynamic equations are given in terms of the thermodynamic variables and the associated conjugate variables .",
    "this is closely related to the algebraic identity given by the time derivative of eq  ( [ 23 ] ) , @xmath207 which the equations of motion  ( [ 26],[27],[28 ] ) must satisfy , @xmath208 this is a very confining expression , and although not all that obvious , does uniquely determine the fluxes @xmath209 and @xmath210 with the help of some auxiliary thermodynamic considerations .",
    "( this is frequently referred to as the hydrodynamic standard procedure . )",
    "so the hydrodynamics is indeed determined once the thermodynamics is ; there is an one - to - one correspondence between them .",
    "given the explicit form of @xmath133 , the equality @xmath211 may now be established via @xmath212 . had @xmath133 been different for some reasons , so would @xmath213 , but the hydrodynamic theory  in terms of @xmath205 and @xmath214 independently  would remain formally unchanged .",
    "including charges and fields , the conserved quantities are @xmath215 and @xmath186 .",
    "so the entropy will depend on them and the two fields , @xmath216 .",
    "again , this is equivalent to @xmath217  compare this to eq  ( [ 33 ] ) to find that we have already made the right choice of variables for the  2-filed \" theory .",
    "what is more , given the cogent , one - to - one relationship between the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics , the associated set of differential equations also possesses the right structure of the low - resolution theory .",
    "this is fortunate , as all there is left to do is to find out how the two fields turn into four .",
    "that is , we may now construct the genuine low - resolution theory by requiring it to reduce to the present one in the 2-field limit , @xmath218 and @xmath219 , ( implying also @xmath220 and @xmath221 ) .",
    "one point remains to be settled : given the algebraic identity , @xmath222 the  2-field \" theory must be given only in terms of the quantities in this equation .",
    "unfortunately , the two fluxes , eqs  ( [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] ) , do not seem to conform to this rule and contain @xmath213 .",
    "this is alright at present , because @xmath223 is given in terms of two quantities that do appear in eq  ( [ fff ] ) , but it seems to spell disaster for the low - resolution theory , because @xmath213 is without a clear meaning there .",
    "similar to the case for @xmath67 , there is no unambiguous division of @xmath185 into @xmath213 and @xmath224 in systems with hidden charges ( although it is being attempted over and over again with predictably rather contradictory results ) .",
    "this is because @xmath213 lacks any physical significance : first , @xmath213 is devoid of its significance as the conserved material momentum density of a neutral system .",
    "second , without a uniquely defined @xmath136 and the associated energy current @xmath133 , neither is @xmath212 useful as a work - around .",
    "( not to mention that this equality is invalid , since @xmath225 is no longer conserved ) .",
    "the same holds for @xmath224 .",
    "nevertheless , one clear - cut definition of @xmath213 does survive : because of the algebraic equivalence between eqs  ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) , we may start from the second expression to obtain the first , _ defining _ @xmath226 as a shorthand .",
    "clearly , this guarantee that the two fluxes , eqs  ( [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] ) , are still given by the quantities of eq  ( [ fff ] ) , even if @xmath213 is no longer given by @xmath60 .    finally , a few remarks about the pressure .",
    "while @xmath32 and @xmath74 , as indicated by eq  ( [ 33 ] ) , remain well defined as conjugate variables , and hence retain their place in the low - resolution theory of the next section , the pressure does not .",
    "[ this is the reason we have chosen to eliminate it from eqs  ( [ 31a],[37 ] ) . ]",
    "one might think of taking @xmath227 , instead of eq  ( [ 31 ] ) , only this derivative is ambiguous and ill - defined : a dense system in the presence of field is anisotropic , so the energy not only depends on the volume , as implied by this definition , but also on the shape . and the appropriate quantity to deal with here is not the pressure , but the stress tensor .    in isotropic liquids ,",
    "the pressure encompasses many concepts that we find convenient , even intuitive : as the surface force density , as the momentum current , as a quantity that is continuous across interfaces , and as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath26 .",
    "hence there is widespread reluctance to abandon the pressure at finite fields .",
    "unfortunately , though there are numerous ways to generalize the pressure that will preserve some of these properties , none covers all .",
    "so one may either define many different pressures ",
    "an approach we eschew as it requires exceeding care and has led to considerable confusion in the literature  or face up to the maxwell stress tensor , as we shall do here .",
    "the theory we are going to consider , and the expressions obtained hereby , are fairly general : they are valid for arbitrarily strong fields and nonlinear constitutive relations ; the medium may be moving , and the electromagnetic field may depend on time .",
    "but we do assume the validity of local equilibrium , which needs the characteristic time @xmath228 to be established .",
    "therefore , all frequencies are confined to @xmath229 .",
    "( we emphasize that the theory is only complete after the dissipative terms have been included .",
    "although the terms given here retain their form off global equilibrium , at finite frequencies , we need to exercise caution when applying them alone . )    to derive the general theory , we need , as in the previous two cases , the input of the maxwell equations and some information on the energy content of the field . the macroscopic maxwell equations are , @xmath230 taking @xmath231 as the variables , the first two are constraints , and the next two their equations of motion .",
    "if @xmath50 and @xmath232 are not specified , eqs  ( [ 49 ] ) do not contain any information beyond charge conservation , as they may actually be derived from @xmath233 and eqs  ( [ 48 ] ) . especially , no restriction whatever is implied for the two  fluxes \" @xmath50 and @xmath232 .",
    "taking the temporal derivative of the second constraint yields @xmath234 , implying there is a vector field @xmath235 such that the divergence - free field @xmath236 may be written as @xmath237 .",

    "the temporal maxwell equations  ( [ 49 ] ) are given content only by taking @xmath50 and @xmath232 as thermodynamic conjugate variables , @xmath241 and @xmath242 , respectively .",
    "more precisely , we assert that , in the rest frame , the thermodynamic energy has the form @xmath243 it should not come as a surprise that we would need this as an input , since the field dependence of @xmath122 was also an input , cf the last paragraph of section  [ fiel ] .",

    "first , eqs  ( [ 33],[rfe1 ] ) leave little choice other than @xmath249 [ the algebraically minded reader may prefer to deduce this expression directly . the appendix in section  [ app ] is specifically written for him . ]",

    "as discussed , this does not imply a field contribution of @xmath254 , though it does tells us that this new @xmath213 replaces the old one in the fluxes of eqs  ( [ 39],[51x ] ) below .",

    "much information is contained in eq  ( [ 39b ] ) , and one could indeed have derived the complete hydrodynamics directly from it , without the detour over the dilute system  @xcite .",
    "the path chosen in this article highlights the physics and minimizes the algebra .",

    "boundary conditions represent information that is extrinsic to the differential equations .",
    "they are provided to choose one special solution from the manifold of all functions satisfying the differential equations . in physics , circumstances are frequently different .",

    "this is all we need to predict the behavior of polarizable systems , as these partial differential equations will deliver unique solutions if a sufficient number of appropriate initial and boundary conditions are provided .",
    "this renders our initial question concerning the force of electromagnetic origin , although as yet unanswered , seemingly irrelevant .",
    "however , physics does not comprise solely of mathematics , and clear thinking about the valid expressions for the electromagnetic force will give us considerable heuristic power in prediction  without having to solve the set of partial differential equations each and every time .",
    "to find an expression for the force in the presence of fields , let us first remind ourselves of its form without fields , a quantity that revolves around the pressure :    * its gradient , @xmath309 , is the bulk force density , the quantity that accelerates a neutral volume element in eq  ( [ 31a ] ) .",

    "* the pressure @xmath135 itself is a surface force density , which contributes to force equilibrium for instance in hydrostatics .",

    "presumably , as in the field free case , the bulk force density vanishes in equilibrium if gravitation is neglected , while the surface force density remains finite",
    ".    generally speaking , the magnetic ponderomotive force is up to five orders of magnitude stronger than the electric one .",

    "when @xmath31 is kept constant instead of @xmath32 , the pressure @xmath738 is the one that is field independent .",

    "the magnetization is usually proportional to the density , or @xmath747 .",
    "similarly , in magnetically dilute ferrofluids , we may assume that the magnetization is proportional to the particle density @xmath172 , @xmath748 .",

    "the velocity dependent terms in the original magnetic bernoulli equation have not been included here , because considerations of mass currents in ferrofluids need to include viscosities . besides , some of the velocity dependent terms in the stress tensor , eq  ( [ 51x ] ) , are missing in  @xcite .      as in section [ tvss ]",
    "above , we may separate out the zero - field pressure @xmath135 from the hydrodynamic bulk force density of eq  ( [ f ] ) , @xmath760 @xmath761 .",
    "( we again neglect gravitation , and consider a stationary medium , @xmath762 . )",

    "so the zero field pressure depends on temperature and densities , and the derived ponderomotive force is valid only under isothermal condition of constant densities , cf the discussion of section  [ tvss ] .",

    "both imply @xmath776 .",
    "then the ponderomotive force reduces to @xmath777 , or @xmath778 assuming in addition a static field : @xmath779 , the force @xmath770 may also be written as @xmath780 , a form one often encounters .",
    "this seems a satisfactory derivation of the kelvin force , as both the linear constitutive relation and the proportionality to the density are frequently valid approximations .",
    "unfortunately , the obviously different expression @xmath781 may be obtained by essentially the same derivation .",
    "we start by defining a slightly different susceptibility : @xmath782 . although different from the more usual convention of eq  ( [ 888 ] ) , the new susceptibility is undoubtedly physically equivalent to the old one , and we have no a priori reason to prefer either .",
    "both susceptibilities are related via @xmath783 , or @xmath784 .",
    "so eq  ( [ 87 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath785 this time , assuming @xmath786 is proportional to one of the densities , we obtain eq  ( [ 88a ] ) .    which is the correct one , eq  ( [ 888 ] ) or ( [ 88a ] ) ?",
    "since eq  ( [ 87])and ( [ 87a ] ) are algebraically equivalent , the difference must stem from the two assumptions , @xmath772 and @xmath787 . reviewing the above derivations",

    "assuming either susceptibility is linear in @xmath26 is only an approximation .",
    "and consistency dictates that all quadratic terms are then to be discarded .",
    "this implies ( i ) in the dilute approximation , both susceptibilities may only retain the term linear in @xmath26 and are therefore equal ; ( ii ) all other terms quadratic in the two susceptibilities are also to be discarded , as @xmath788 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath854 because @xmath855 for the given geometry .",
    "the integral is to be evaluated for @xmath856 , and at constant @xmath857 if equilibrium has time to be established . for times",
    "much briefer after the current has been applied , we need to substitute @xmath26 for @xmath442 , and @xmath858 for @xmath400 , and evaluated the integral at constant @xmath32 , @xmath172 , cf the discussion leading to eq  ( [ sn2 ] ) . neglecting the surface tension , @xmath859 , and taking the subscript @xmath441 lead to the result given in  @xcite .    in the spirit of the last paragraph of section  [ surff ]",
    ", we remark that eq  ( [ smb ] ) may be considered as an expression for force equilibrium , between gravitation , surface tension and the magnetic surface force .    for lcr , @xmath860",
    ", the left hand side reduces to @xmath861 , and we are left with a quadratic , hyperbolic profile of the interface , @xmath862 @xmath863 @xmath864 if the surface tension @xmath89 is neglected .",
    "the effect of @xmath89 is more important for weak currents , @xmath652 small .",
    "it may be neglected in any case for @xmath865 , where both curvature radii are large enough to be ignored .",
    "for @xmath850 large , one curvature radius is simply @xmath866 , and the other @xmath867 .",
    "so this part of the ferrofluid column is accounted for by @xmath868 @xmath869 @xmath870 @xmath864 , with the term @xmath871 being asymptotically ( @xmath872 ) the dominant one . in between , where the actual bend from the horizontal to the vertical takes place , both curvature radii are finite and need to be included for an understanding of the surface  note , however , that they have different signs .      in a system of two connected tubes , with only the second subject to a magnetic field",
    ", we expect the ferrofluid column to be higher in this tube , as ferrofluid is attracted to the region of stronger fields , see fig 3 .",
    "to calculate the level difference , we employ the boundary condition eq  ( [ k ] ) for the ( flat ) liquid - air interface in both tubes .",
    "since the field vanishes in the first tube ( denoted as 1 ) , the boundary condition simply states @xmath873 . inserting this into the boundary condition for tube 2 , we obtain @xmath874 note again the force balance between the electromagnetic surface force eq  ( [ emsf2 ] ) , operational at the surface in tube 2 , and the gravitational force from the disparity in height .",
    "( as in section [ mse ] , the integral is to be evaluated at constant @xmath32 and @xmath432 if equilibrium has time to be established . for much briefer times",
    "after the field has been applied , @xmath442 is to be replaced by @xmath26 , and the integral by @xmath441 , evaluated at constant @xmath709 . )     outside the ferrofluid is constant . depending on the orientation of the field , the level difference @xmath875",
    "is given by eqs  ( [ 123y ] ) and ( [ 124y ] ) . ]",
    "if the field is either predominantly tangential to the liquid surface ( @xmath876 , @xmath877 and @xmath878 ) , or predominantly normal to the liquid surface ( @xmath879 , @xmath880 and @xmath298 , @xmath881 ) , we have respectively , @xmath882 with the last equal signs in both equations only valid for lcr .",
    "next we consider the quantity that a pressure gauge measures in a ferrofluid exposed to a magnetic field .",
    "as emphasized , it is not the ordinary pressure , yet as it will give some value , the question is what this is .",
    "think of the gauge as an enclosed volume of air , at the pressure @xmath883 , see fig 4 .",
    "one side of this volume is an elastic membrane , which is displaced if the external stress tensor deviates from the internal one .",
    "a finite displacement @xmath884 stores up the elastic energy @xmath885 per unit area of the membrane .",
    "( take the membrane to be stiff , ie @xmath886 large and @xmath884 small , then we need not worry about the pressure change inside . )",
    "the elastic energy implies a force density @xmath887 , rendering the boundary condition across the membrane as @xmath888 , or via eq  ( [ k ] ) , @xmath889 .",
    "( @xmath884 is taken to be positive when the membrane protrudes into the gauge . )",
    "is given by eq  ( [ 303 ] ) . ]",
    "we have @xmath890 as long as the external stress tensor is the same as the internal one , ie in the atmosphere down to the liquid surface of tube 2 , and also just below the surface ",
    "take this as point 2 . moving down the liquid column , to an arbitrary point 3 ,",
    "the membrane moves the distance @xmath884 to maintain force equilibrium . employing the above boundary condition for both points , and subtracting one from the other , we find @xmath891 with @xmath892 . note @xmath893 , where @xmath894 is the magnetization at point 3 normal to the pressure gauge membrane , and @xmath895 the field at point 2 normal to the liquid surface",
    " both components are not necessarily parallel .",
    "eq  ( [ 303 ] ) again states a force balance , between the elastic , magnetic surface and gravitational force .",
    "the displacement @xmath884 is the readout of the pressure gauge : if the field is uniform , and if the membrane of the gauge is parallel to the liquid surface , eq  ( [ 303 ] ) reduce to @xmath896 , the zero - field hydrostatic relation ; otherwise , field contributions abound  even if the pressure gauge is simply rotated at point 3 in the presence of a uniform field .",
    "this amply demonstrates the system s anisotropy .",
    "a further complication is that all fields are the actual ones , distorted by the presence of the pressure gauge  though this is an effect that may be minimized .      in this section ,",
    "we address the physics of some technical applications : magnetic o - rings , self - levitation and scrap separation .",
    "consider scrap separation first .",
    "an inhomogeneous magnetic field which becomes weaker with increasing height may lift non - polarizable bodies submerged in ferrofluids off the ground , and hold them at specific heights which depend on the shape and density of the bodies .",
    "the calculation is already given in section  [ surff ] . balancing the gravitation with magnetic force",
    ", we have @xmath897 , where @xmath898 @xmath899 , and @xmath900 is given by eqs  ( [ emsf2 ] , [ emsf ] ) , and especially by eqs  ( [ emsf3 ] , [ emsf4 ] ) if the solid is completely nonmagnetic .",
    "( again , depending on the time scale , the integral @xmath492 may be the appropriate one , cf section  [ mse ] . )",
    "because scrap separation is an equilibrium phenomenon , we may compare energies instead of computing forces .",
    "this is a simpler and more qualitative approach to understand the behavior of polarizable systems .",
    "consider for instance the fact that ferrofluid is attracted to the region of high magnetic field .",
    "take the field @xmath431 as given , the field energy per unit volume is @xmath901 in vacuum ( or air ) , and @xmath902 in ferrofluids .",
    "since @xmath903 in any paramagnets , the second expression is smaller . given the choice , a volume element of ferrofluid will therefore always occupy a region with the highest possible field , to reduce the field energy .",
    "conversely , a small , non - magnetizable object , submerged in ferrofluid , will on the other hand tend to occupy the region of lowest field strength .",
    "if a difference in height is involved , all these of course happen only as long as the gain in field energy is larger than the loss in gravitational energy levitating the object .",
    "( if the field @xmath358 is given instead of @xmath431 , we need to consider @xmath904 . and",
    "again , it is larger in vacuum then in the ferrofluid : @xmath905 . )    similarly , a permanently magnetized body submerged in ferrofluid tends to collect as much liquid around itself as possible , in the space occupied by its stray field  even at the price of levitating itself off the bottom , a phenomenon that is usually referred to as  self - levitation \"  @xcite . frequently , the magnetized body consists of a periodic array of north and south poles , with periodicity @xmath906 , so the stray field extends one or two @xmath906 into the ferrofluid .",
    "levitated approximately that far from the bottom , the body will usually have reached its equilibrium position , as no further gain in field energy may be achieved by pushing more ferrofluid below it , and levitating itself yet higher , fig 5 .    generally speaking , although energetic considerations are a useful heuristic tool , the actual minimization of total energy or free energy is often rather cumbersome , as the field does change considerably when a volume element of ferrofluid is displaced . for quantitative calculations ,",
    "it is therefore frequently more convenient to consider boundary conditions involving the maxwell stress tensor , as we have done throughout this review article .",
    "this also pertains to magnetic o - rings , which may be found in most computer hard disk drives and are perhaps the most widely deployed ferrofluid device . in these",
    ", some ferrofluid is positioned as an o - ring between a highly permeable rotating shaft and the pole of a permanent magnet , fig 6 .",
    "serving as a pressure seal , it enables the rotary component to work in vacuum .",
    "in contrast to the above circumstances , we are dealing with a metastable state here , as it is always energetically more favorable to remove the ferrofluid seal first , have the pressure equalized , and then return the seal to its original place at the poles .",
    "so the quantity of interest is the lowest energy barrier that must be overcome , which in any realistic problems is a quantity notoriously difficult to find . the correct force balance , on the other hand , is easy to write down : @xmath907 expressing the balance between the difference in the electromagnetic surface force [ cf eq  ( [ emsf2 ] ) ] on the two free surfaces ( area a ) of the ferrofluid and the difference in external pressure .",
    "the equation is obtained by considering the boundary condition @xmath908 , for both free surfaces , call them 1 and 2 .",
    "use eq  ( [ 301 ] ) , forget gravitation , and remember that @xmath135 is different for 1 and 2 to arrive at eq  ( [ ml4 ] ) , with @xmath909 .",
    "the field is strongest in the middle of the o - ring and decays towards both ends .",
    "if @xmath910 were zero , the force @xmath911 would be the same on both surfaces , and the ferrofluid stays in the middle of the o - ring . increasing the pressure on the left ( surface 1 ) pushes the ferrofluid towards right , such that surface 1 is in the region of higher , and surface 2 is in the region of weaker , fields .",
    "equilibrium is achieved when the difference in @xmath911 balances @xmath912 .",
    "the strongest pressure difference maintainable is when one surface is at the region of highest field , and the other is field - free .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the magnetic field is predominantly tangential , and that lcr holds , we have @xmath913 . with @xmath914 , @xmath915 , and taking @xmath916 as of order @xmath917a / m , this pressure difference is about @xmath917n / m@xmath918 , approximately the atmospheric pressure .",
    "a droplet of ferrofluid exposed to an external magnetic field along @xmath635 is distorted , cf eg  @xcite .",
    "if the field is not too strong , it turns from a sphere of radius @xmath866 to an ellipsoid of essentially the same volume , @xmath919 , with @xmath920 the semimajor and semiminor axes , @xmath921 , see fig 7 . given a uniform applied field , @xmath922 ,",
    "the internal field of a magnetizable ellipsoid is also uniform , and along the applied field , even for nonlinear constitutive relation , cf    8 of @xcite .",
    "once these facts are assumed , it is fairly simple to calculate the distortion , even nonlinearly , as a function of the field , because again , only the boundary condition , @xmath923 from eqs  ( [ 54 ] ) , needs to be evaluated , at the points @xmath924 and @xmath925 .",
    "they are respectively @xmath926 employing eq  ( [ k ] ) to evaluate the respective left side of these two equations , we find @xmath927 , because all fields are constant within the ellipsoid , and because @xmath928 at @xmath929 , @xmath855 at @xmath925 .",
    "( the extent of the droplet is presumed small enough for us to neglect the gravitation . ) taking the difference also of the right hand side , we arrive at @xmath930 where the parameter @xmath931 is related to the eccentricity @xmath932 : @xmath933 .",
    "( with @xmath934 , we have @xmath935 , @xmath936 . )",
    "this result is the same as that given in  @xcite .",
    "both sides of this equation may be approximated independently : for small eccentricity , the right side reduces to @xmath937 , while the left side reduces to @xmath938 for lcr .",
    "in addition , we have @xmath939 , where @xmath940 is the applied field , and @xmath941 for small eccentricity , cf  8 in @xcite .    ) . ]",
    "the validity of eq  ( [ 40 ] ) is shown here directly by transforming the rest frame expression .",
    "more specifically , we demonstrate @xmath942 , holding @xmath31 , @xmath166 , @xmath943 , and @xmath703 constant .",
    "we start with      this pleasingly simple expression is a result of the accidental cancellation of the terms from the galilean - lorentz transformation with that of the tailor expansion , @xmath945 assuming lcr , or @xmath946 with @xmath947 , we have @xmath948 and deduce @xmath949 higher order terms ( such as one @xmath950 in the energy @xmath951 ) do not invalidate this result .",
    "the terms in the magnetic field behave analogously .    in eq  ( [ yi ] ) , the explicit form of @xmath186 in the lab frame was employed to deduce the lab frame energy , eq  ( [ 40 ] ) , from which then the lab frame energy flux , eq  ( [ 39 ] ) , is deduced .",
    "this may appear as an inconsistency , but is not , because with the rest frame expression for @xmath952 given , we already know that the term @xmath953 is from the rest mass .",
    "no detailed information about the energy flux is necessary here .",
