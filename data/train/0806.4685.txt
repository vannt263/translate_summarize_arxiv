    "the propagation occurs anisotropically .",
    "another remarkable result is the birefringence effect occurring with the permittivity @xmath166 and constant permeability @xmath107 , in the presence of external fields . for this case , if the external electric field is absent there will be no birefringence .",
    "nevertheless , if both the electric and the magnetic fields are present a kind of magnetoelectric birefringence appears as the unique effect .",
    "this result shows that it is possible to produce such birefringence effect without any other accompanying standard birefringence , as the kerr or cotton - mouton effects . by symmetry",
    ", it can be inferred that a similar effect occurs with @xmath167 and constant permittivity .",
    "finally , it should be stressed the behavior of the front wave associated with the extraordinary ray .",
    "depending on each medium in which the propagation occurs , the extraordinary ray can present its velocity greater or smaller than the velocity of the ordinary ray depending on the direction of propagation .",
    "further , the coincidence between the both rays can occur in several directions .",
    "the authors are grateful to a. c. zambroni de souza for reading the manuscript .",
    "this work was partially supported by the brazilian research agencies cnpq and fapemig .",
    "gpg thanks the support from fapemig during his m - sc studies .",
    "in this appendix , the kerr effect is derived by means of the cayley - hamilton method @xcite . using the same assumptions presented in section [ iva1 ] we obtain , from eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) , @xmath168 the solutions of the eigenvalue problem stated by eq .",
