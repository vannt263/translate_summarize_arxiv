    "multi - frequency electrical impedance tomography ( mfeit ) @xcite can be applied to the non - invasive assessment of abdominal obesity , which is a predictor of health risk .",
    "mfeit data of the boundary current - voltage relationship at various frequencies of @xmath0 1 mhz reflect the regional distribution of body fat , which is less conductive than water and tissues such as muscle , and can therefore be used to estimate the thicknesses of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue .",
    "this diagnostic information can be used to assess abdominal obesity , which is considered a cause of metabolic syndrome as well as a risk factor for various other health conditions @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution of computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance ( mr ) images is high enough for the assessment of abdominal obesity @xcite ; however , there are concerns and limitations regarding their use for this purpose ; e.g. , ct exposes the subject to ionizing radiation , while mr imaging has poor temporal resolution .",
    "electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) is a noninvasive , low - cost imaging technique that provides real - time data without using ionizing radiation .",
    "however , experiences over the past three decades have not succeeded in making eit robust against forward modeling errors such as those associated with uncertainties in boundary geometry and electrode positions . in time - difference eit , which images changes in the conductivity distribution with time , forward modeling errors",
    "are effectively handled and largely eliminated when the data are subtracted from the reference data at a predetermined time .",
    "time - difference eit for imaging the time changes in the conductivity distribution effectively handle the forward modeling errors , which are somewhat eliminated from the use of time - difference data subtracting reference data at a predetermined fixed time .    in static eit , however , there are no reference data that can be used to eliminate the forward modeling error @xcite .",
    "creating reference - like data would be the key issue in static eit .",
    "this paper proposes a new reconstruction method that uses prior anatomical information , at the expense of spatial resolution , to compensate for this fundamental drawback of static eit and improve its reproducibility . in the case of abdominal eit , it is possible to use a spatial prior to handle its inherent ill - posed nature .",
    "the proposed method employs a depth - based reconstruction algorithm that takes into account the background region , boundary geometry , electrode configuration , and current patterns . here",
    ", we could take advantage of recent advances in 3d scanner technology to minimize the forward modeling error by extracting accurate boundary geometry and electrode positions .",
    "the proposed method uses a specially chosen current pattern to obtain a depth - dependent data set , generating reference - like data that are used to outline the borders between fat and muscle . from the relation between a current injected through one pair of electrodes and the induced voltage drop though the other pair of electrodes , we obtain the transadmittance , which is the ratio of the current to the voltage .",
    "hence , the transadmittance depends on the positions of two pairs of electrodes , body geometry , and admittivity distribution .",
    "we can extract the corresponding apparent admittivity in term of two pairs of electrodes from the transadmittance divided by a factor involving electrode positions and the body geometry .",
    "this apparent admittivity changes with the choice of pairs of electrodes .",
    "( in the special case when the subject is homogeneous , the apparent admittivity does not depend on electrode positions . )",
    "noting that the change in apparent admittivity in the depth direction can be generated by varying the distance between electrodes , we could probe the admittivity distribution by developing a proper and efficient algorithm based on a least - squares minimization .",
    "the performance of the proposed least - squares approach is demonstrated using numerical simulations with a 32-channel eit system and human like domain .",
    "future research study is to adopt an mfeit technique to exploit the frequency - dependent behavior of human tissue @xcite .",
    "the distribution of visceral fat in abdominal region can then be estimated from the linear relation between the data and the admittivity spectra , and thus obtain a clinically useful absolute conductivity image .",
    "let an imaging object occupy three ( or two ) dimensional domain @xmath1 with its admittivity distribution @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the conductivity , @xmath4 the permittivity , and @xmath5 the angular frequency .",
    "the domain @xmath1 can be divide by 4 subregions ; subcutaneous fat region @xmath6 , muscle region @xmath7 , bone region @xmath8 , and remaining region @xmath9 as shown in figure [ fig : illustrate - abdomen - tissue - spectroscopy ] ( a ) .    [",

    "the @xmath12 is essential which can be obtained numerically by using the fem with homogeneous admittivity @xmath13 in @xmath1 . to give conditions similar to real situations , the fem uses optimally generated meshes",

    "we merge the 32 result images to 1 image as shown in figure [ fig : recon - humanbody - linearized-32 ] .     with noisy data.,width=491 ]    it is worth pointing out that the column vectors of @xmath18 are highly correlated .",
    "the correlation function @xmath19 between the column vectors can be defined by @xmath20 for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are column vectors of @xmath18 .",
    "we compute the correlation @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 for @xmath27 which correspond to the mesh elements @xmath28 near the boundary , @xmath29 in the middle of @xmath6 , and @xmath30 far from the boundary @xmath31 .",

    "it is also worth emphasizing that other imaging algorithms such as music @xcite can not perform well because precisely of the high correlation of column vectors of the sensitivity matrix @xmath18 .",
    "in this work , static eit image reconstruction algorithm of human abdomen for identifying subcutaneous fat region is developed .",
    "the proposed depth - based reconstruction method relies on theorem [ thm : main ] which shows that subcutaneous fat influence in the data can be eliminated by using a reference - like data and geometry information ( domain shape and electrode configuration ) to overcome a fundamental drawback in static eit ; lack of reference data for handling the forward modeling errors .",
    "we suggest a linearized method with tikhonov regularization which uses the subcutaneous influence eliminated data with a specially chosen current pattern .",
    "numerical simulations show that the reconstruction result of identifying the subcutaneous fat region is quite satisfactory .",
    "the suggested way of eliminating influence of homogeneous background admittivity can be applied in other static eit area , for instance , ground detection .",
