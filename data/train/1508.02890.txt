    "ever since their discovery , chiral molecular systems puzzled and inspired researches .",
    "the mirror symmetry , characterizing two molecular enatiomers , is possibly the simplest broken symmetry to think of .",
    "the complexity and variety of interactions and occurrences in nature of different enatiomers , flowing from such a small difference in their structure , is amazing .",
    "chiral nature of living matter poses both fundamental and practical questions , from the origins of homochirality in biomolecules @xcite to detection and manipulation @xcite of chiral properties .",
    "the oldest method used to detect chirality in such media is optical rotation : the polarization plane of a linearly polarized light propagating through left and right chiral media rotates in opposite directions ( see e.g. optical rotation measurement in epoxypropane molecule ; we shall use this molecule to illustrate our concepts here @xcite ) , microscopically , optical rotation is governed by the interplay of dipole transitions in a chiral medium caused by electric and magnetic fields of a light wave .",
    "while the electric transition dipoles are identical in the two enantiomers in their respective molecular frames , the magnetic dipoles are pointing in opposite directions leading to opposite dynamical electronic response in the two enantiomers .",
    "the same mechanism underlies other linear chiroptical techniques which use circularly polarized light to detect differences in absorption ( circular dichroism ) , raman scattering , or circular fluorescence @xcite between the two enantiomers .",
    "it is useful to note that while chirality is a topological property of molecular structure , chiral response to light is caused by chiral electronic dynamics , which thus effectively measures this structural property .",
    "weak magnetic effects lead to weak chiroptical response .",
    "for example , circular dichroism is often three to six orders of magnitude smaller than light absorbance at the same wavelength .",
    "weakness of chiral response poses challenges for time - resolved measurements of chiral dynamics .",
    "one way of increasing chiral response is to employ techniques that do not rely on weak interaction with the magnetic field component of the electromagnetic wave , such as e.g. photoelectron spectroscopy @xcite , microwave detection @xcite , or coulomb explosion imaging @xcite .",
    "two of these techniques , one - photon @xcite and multiphoton @xcite photoelectron circular dichroism ( pecd ) are pertinent to the approaches to chiral discrimination involving high harmonic generation ( chhg method @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , one - photon ionization is the inverse of photorecombination , which is the key step in high harmonic generation .",
    "the pecd detection requires resolving the direction of the final electron momentum : the photoelectron angular distribution obtained from randomly oriented chiral molecules shows asymmetry with respect to the direction of light propagation .",
    "this asymmetry originates from the electron interaction with the chiral potential of the core @xcite , i.e. is the dynamical consequence of the chiral structure .",
    "the effect is most prominent for low energy electrons @xcite , since interaction with the chiral core potential is maximized in this case .",
    "the chiral dichroism signal achievable with pecd , up to some 10% , sets the golden standard for the chhg method @xcite .    with the advent of ultrafast light sources",
    ", there has been an increasing interest in developing ultrafast chiroptical spectroscopic techniques to investigate chiral response in the time domain . in the condensed phase ,",
    "several breakthroughs have been achieved @xcite using non - linear chiroptical spectroscopy @xcite . in the gas phase , where isolated compounds can be studied ,",
    "such measurements are a lot more challenging due to low density of samples , so that no ultrafast measurement at @xmath2 fsec time scale has yet been reported",
    ". high sensitivity of pecd may open a path towards such measurements , provided that ultrashort circularly polarized laser @xcite or xuv pulses @xcite are used .",
    "importantly , chhg naturally offers sub - femtosecond temporal resolution and allows one to detect multielectron chiral dynamics on their natural attosecond timescale .",
    "the chiral response can be monitored with @xmath3 0.1 fsec resolution @xcite , orders of magnitude better than achieved so far ( see e.g. @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "already the first experiments @xcite demonstrated very high enantio - sensitivity of the chhg approach , leading to about 2 - 3% chiral signal for nearly linearly polarized laser fields , with ellipticity @xmath4",
    ". thus , chhg may represent an exciting alternative to pecd for ultrafast studies in the gas phase .",
    "here we discuss the opportunities for extending the first chhg measurements @xcite to increase their sensitivity and versatility , striving to turn chhg into a standard ultrafast chiroptical detection technique .",
    "high - harmonics generation ( hhg ) can be understood as a sequence of three steps @xcite : ionization in a strong laser field , laser - induced acceleration of the liberated electron , and its recombination with the parent ion , all within the same laser cycle .",
    "high harmonic generation spectroscopy can be viewed as a pump - probe technique .",
    "ionization acts as a pump , simultaneously launching the continuum electron and the correlated multielectron dynamics in the cation .",
    "recombination acts as a probe of such dynamics @xcite .",
    "the pump - probe delay is controlled by light oscillation with attosecond precision ; the ionization and emission times can be accurately characterised @xcite .",
    "effectively , the emitted light records a movie of the recombining system , with each harmonic representing a single frame @xcite .",
    "the ability to record multielectron dynamics on attosecond time - scale @xcite is one of the most exciting features of high harmonic spectroscopy .",
    "this multielectron dynamics can be visualised as the motion of a hole created in a molecule upon ionization .",
    "the shape , location , and momentum of the hole during recombination are mapped onto the properties of the emitted light - its amplitudes , phases , and polarizations @xcite .",
    "this link is crucial for chhg .",
    "indeed , one of the effective mechanisms of chiral sensitivity of hhg is directly linked to attosecond laser - driven dynamics of the hole between ionization and recombination .",
    "equivalently , one can think about laser - driven multi - electron dynamics in the molecular ion , i.e. light - induced transitions between its electronic states .",
    "chiral sensitivity arises due to the interference of two types of transitions between the electronic states of the cation @xcite : the electric dipole transitions driven by the minor component of the electric field , and the magnetic dipole transitions driven by the major component of the magnetic field .",
    "this inteplay of the magnetic dipole and electric dipole transitions occurs on the sub - cycle time - scale .",
    "the enantio - sensitive sub - cycle dynamics reflects the molecular structure , which dictates the strength of the strong - field driven chiral response .",
    "note that this dynamics occurs with the nuclei still located at their positions in the neutral molecule : there is very little time for the nuclei to move during the fraction of the laser cycle between ionization and recombination .",
    "optimal regime for the interference of the magentic dipole transition driven by the major component of the magnetic field and the electric dipole transition driven by the minor component of the electric field requires balance between the magnitudes of the respective interactions , @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 are the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields of the laser pulse , @xmath7 is the matrix element of the magnetic dipole transition , @xmath8 is the matrix element of the electric dipole transition , @xmath9 is the ellipticity of the laser field , @xmath10 is the amplitude of the minor component of the electric field . since @xmath11 ,",
    "the balance is achieved for @xmath12 , i.e. for nearly linear fields .",
    "since @xmath13 changes direction by @xmath14 between the two enantiomers of the chiral molecule , constructive interference requires opposite values of helicity for right and left enantiomers , giving rise to chiral dichroism .",
    "chiral dichroism at a few percent level for such almost linear fields observed in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates high potential for chiral discrimination of this new technique .",
    "however , as with any new technique , its first implementation may not be optimal .    the observed chhg signal @xcite maximises for very low ellipticities @xmath4 .",
    "on the one hand , the chiral response typically increases with increasing ellipticity , likely maximizing for circular rather than nearly linear fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the harmonic signal drops quickly with increasing ellipticity .",
    "these conflicting requirements seem to preclude exploration of what could be a more favourable regime .",
    "resolving this conflict should enhance sensitivity and flexibility of the chhg technique .",
    "tailoring driving fields to maximize the chiral response and optimize the chhg is a clear direction forward .",
    "specifically , one should aim to ( i ) maximise effects of the chiral hole dynamics in the molecular ion between ionization and recombination , without sacrificing high harmonic generation efficiency ; ( ii ) explore application of other tools of high harmonic spectroscopy to chiral discrimination , complementing measurements of the harmonic spectra with measurements of the harmonic phase @xcite .",
    "below , we show how both aims can be achieved using tailored multicolor fields .",
    "the use of multicolor , shaped fields for chhg should allow one to achieve two important goals .",
    "first , additional fields can couple ionic states populated during ionization to the ionic states not directly populated during the ionization step , but characterized by strong magnetic dipole transitions , for example due to the proximity of their respective orbitals to a chiral center .",
    "this would make the chhg method truly general , applicable to many chiral molecules , even if the ionization step does not directly populate electronic states with strong magneto - dipole transitions .",
    "second , circular light has long been used to detect chiral response because such light has high chirality .",
    "however , the high harmonic yield maximises for linear fields and quickly drops with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "application of chiral multi - color fields resolves this problem .",
    "the family of counter - rotating two - color fields , introduced in @xcite , can combine circular or elliptic polarization with strong high harmonic response @xcite .    here",
    "we consider the application of elliptic counter - rotating two - color laser fields , @xmath15 to induce , enhance and manipulate the chiral hhg response from randomly oriented gas of chiral molecules . in eq.(1 )",
    "@xmath16 is the field strength , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the ellipticities of the fundamental field and its second harmonic , @xmath19 are the unit vectors in the poarization ( x , y ) plane of the laser field .",
    "below , we theoretically show that application of such fields should allow one ( i ) to improve the sensitivity of the chhg method to rival the sensitivity of the pecd measurements , without relying on using the driving light with very small ellipticity , ( ii ) to increase the range of harmonics for which the chiral signal is strong .",
    "we also show how phase measurements of the chiral high harmonic signal allow one to determine the amount of specific enatiomers ( enantiomeric excess ) in a mixture , in a way that does not require one to know the medium concentration",
    ". finally , we present the theoretical background for the reconstruction of time - dependent chiral response for arbitrary ellipticities and configurations of the driving laser fields .",
    "in this section , we apply the approach we have already used in @xcite to estimate the high harmonic signal vs ellipticity of the field given by eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) .",
    "we set the ellipticities of both fields to be equal , @xmath20 .",
    "we will consider an epoxypropane molecule ch@xmath0chch@xmath21o ( also known as 1,2-propylene oxide ) , which has been used in the first chhg experiments @xcite .",
    "there are two key chhg channels in strong field ionization of epoxypropane .",
    "these channels are associated with leaving the ion either in the ground electronic state @xmath22 upon ionization , or in the first excited state electronic state @xmath23 . in the former case",
    ", the returning electron can recombine with the ion in state @xmath22 , in the latter case , with the ion in state @xmath23 .",
    "higher excited electronic states are well separated in energy from these two , and do not contribute to ionization in strong mid - infrared laser fields .",
    "recombination of the continuum electron with the parent ion in these states gives raise to direct hhg channels , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    "the first letter marks the ionization channel and the last marks the recombination channel .",
    "laser - induced transitions between the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the ion open additional cross - channels @xcite : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for example , strong field ionization can leave the ion in the state @xmath22 , but laser - induced transitions can excite the ion to the state @xmath23 .",
    "the returning electron now has to recombine with this state : the hole created in the molecule during ionization is different from the hole before recombination .",
    "this results in the @xmath26 channel in hhg .",
    "importantly , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are chiral sensitive since they involve the interference of the laser - driven electric dipole and magnetic dipole transitions @xcite .",
    "our calculations @xcite show that ionization and recombination create strongly preferred direction for the @xmath28 channel , while the ionization - recombination angular dependence for the channel @xmath22 has no such preferred direction . also , the cross - channel @xmath26 associated with the ionization to the channel @xmath29 followed by recombination to the channel @xmath28 is suppressed relative to the channel @xmath27 . along the direction of maximal ionization for the channel @xmath28 , the strength of the channel @xmath26",
    "is @xmath30 compared to the channel @xmath27 .",
    "these considerations allow us to develop a very simple model of the overall process @xcite : @xmath31e^{-ie _ { a x}\\tau(n)}+r _ { x x}\\right ] \\label{sfa : model0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the symbol @xmath32 denotes n - th harmonic component of the laser - induced polarization associated with channel @xmath33 , i.e. ionization that leaves the ion in the state @xmath34 and recombination with the ion in the state @xmath35 .",
    "the overline denotes orientation - averaged quantities .",
    "the complex - valued relative amplitude of the cross - channel , @xmath36 , is given by orientation - averaged amplitude of the laser - induced transition from the state @xmath23 to the state @xmath22 .",
    "this amplitude takes into account all laser - driven transitions , including the transitions driven by the magnetic field component due to the strong magnetic dipole which couples these states .",
    "the cross - channel @xmath37 is maximized in the direction given by the solid angle @xmath38 that optimizes ionization into @xmath23 and recombination into @xmath22 in the molecular frame . the contribution of the cross - channel is still averaged over all angles in the plane orthogonal to this direction .    in the last equality in eq.([sfa : model0 ] ) , we have written down explicitly the relative phase evolution between the channels @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with @xmath39 being the time - delay between ionization and recombination and @xmath40 the difference in the energies between the ionic states @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "relevant molecular properties including transition matrix elements are described in detail in @xcite , where we have performed calculations for the single - color elliptical field .",
    "here we use the same input and strategy and only change the single - color elliptical field to the field given by eq .",
    "according to the calculations of the ionization and recombination amplitudes @xcite , the relative contribution of the @xmath41 channel , @xmath42 , is close to unity .",
    "we have established @xcite that in the single color elliptical field , due to the weakness of the chiral sensitive cross - channels ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) , these channels can only leave their fingerprint in the high harmonic spectrum near a specific harmonic order , for which the main channels @xmath24 and @xmath25 interfere destructively . the phase term @xmath40 in eq.([sfa : model0 ] ) controls this interference .",
    "following the model in eq.([sfa : model0 ] ) , to estimate chiral dichroism in the two - color elliptically polarized counter - rotating fields , we need to know the ionization @xmath43 and recombination @xmath44 times for each harmonic order @xmath45 .",
    "this allows one to calculate the chiral cross - channel : the amplitude of populating the state @xmath22 at the time @xmath44 after the ion was created in the state @xmath23 at the time @xmath43 .",
    "these times are the well - known solutions of the saddle point equations for high harmonic generation in such two - color fields @xcite . using eq.([sfa : model0 ] )",
    "we can now evaluate the normalized high harmonic signal vs ellipticity @xmath20 ( see eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "1 ( left panel ) shows the calculated chiral dichroism as a function of @xmath46 , for @xmath16=0.0239 a.u .",

    "( @xmath50 nm ) .",
    "high values of chiral dichroism are observed in a wide range of harmonic numbers , not only in the region of the destructive interference of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels , which is around harmonic 43 .",
    "stronger chiral dichroism in this region ( about 80 @xmath51 ) as compared to results obtained in weakly elliptical fields ( about 3 @xmath52 ) @xcite is due to the order of magnitude higher ellipticity ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "there are two factors leading to this increase for relatively small ellipticities .",
    "firstly , in the range @xmath54 , chiral dichroism is proportional to ellipticity : increasing ellipticity 14 times will respectively increase the chiral dichroism .",
    "secondly , for the field used here , the amplitude of the transition between the states @xmath23 and @xmath22 is almost two times higher for @xmath53 then for the single - color field of the same ellipticity .    for higher ellipticities , the disparity between the laser - induced transitions between left and right enantiomers increases and the destructive interference is no longer the decisive mechanism in revealing chiral effects . for example ,",
    "chiral dichroism at the level of about 20% is found for harmonics 35 - 51 and ellipticity @xmath55 .",
    "such high values of chiral dichroism are on par with values achievable with pecd method .",
    "the specific value of chiral dichroism for large ellipticities depends on many additional factors .",
    "one such factor is the achiral background .",
    "achiral contributions to the harmonic signal are associated @xcite with the diagonal hhg channels , involving the cation staying in the same electronic state between ionization and recombination .",
    "we found that importance of these channels in chhg can be controlled via the stark shift in the two - color field eq.(1 ) .",
    "specifically , most chiral molecules are polar and have permanent dipoles in the cationic states .",
    "laser interaction with the permanent dipole induces the linear stark shift . for intense laser fields , these shifts easily approach the @xmath56 scale .",
    "such shifts play important role in laser - induced dynamics in the cation between ionization and recombination .",
    "therefore , they can be used to control chhg by shaping the laser field in the plane of polarization .",
    "this is precisely what is achieved by varying @xmath20 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "indeed , for a given electronic state of the cation @xmath35 with a permanent dipole @xmath57 , the additional phase accumulated in this state due to its interaction with the laser electric field is : @xmath58 here @xmath59 describe the sub - cycle temporal structure of the electric field in the @xmath60 polarization plane , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the corresponding components of the permanent dipole .",
    "the amplitude @xmath63 of the achiral contribution to the high harmonic field , associated with this state , acquires the corresponding additional phase factor , @xmath64 . in strong mid - ir fields @xmath65",

    "( [ alpha3],[alpha4 ] ) : @xmath129 again , we note that every observable in eq . ( [ alpha05 ] )",
    "depends on @xmath45 and @xmath9 . therefore , the application of eq .",
    "( [ alpha05 ] ) to every harmonic and every ellipticity should yield exactly the same value of @xmath110 , thus reducing the signal to noise ratio .",
    "we remind the reader that in this scheme , the independence of the measurement on concentration ( number density ) arises from normalizing the harmonic response to its value at @xmath84 , see eqs.([alpha00],[alpha01 ] ) . from now on , all signals will be understood as normalized to their values at @xmath84 , thus explicitly removing their dependence on molecular concentration ( number density ) .    note that in the second approach we perform redundant spectral measurements by measuring harmonic response for both s- and r - molecules while varying ellipticity in the full range , @xmath130 , increasing the redundancy of the first scheme by factor two .",
    "as established in ref.@xcite , the main difference between the chhg signals coming from the two enantiomers is due to the small magnetic - dipole response in the cation .",
    "thus , the multi - electron wavepacket in the cation acquires small correction , which is linear in @xmath131 ( a straightforward result of the first order perturbation theory ) : @xmath132 here @xmath133 is the time - dependent wavefunction describing the dynamics in the cation in the dipole approximation , @xmath134 is the chiral correction of the time - dependent response , opposite for s and r molecules .",
    "this small correction to the multi - electron dynamics in the cation yields chiral correction to the harmonic field @xmath135 .",
    "\\label{eq : dysonhhg22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used the number density - independent signals , which can be obtained by normalizing the harmonic fields at @xmath114 to their values for @xmath84 , @xmath136 here @xmath137 is the normalized harmonic field in the dipole approximation .",
    "the first - order in @xmath7 expression is general .",
    "its only assumption is the linear response of the cation to the weak effect of the magnetic field .",
    "the dipole @xmath137 is not chiral sensitive ( once averaged over randomly oriented ensemble ) , @xmath138 .",
    "the chiral - sensitive component is @xmath139 .",
    "the harmonic yield for left and right enantiomers is then : @xmath140 .",
    "\\label{eq : y}\\ ] ] using eq.([eq : y ] ) , one obtains for the chiral dichroism @xmath141 ( the difference between the harmonic yields @xmath142 for left and right molecules divided by the signal from the racemic mixture ) : @xmath143 here @xmath144 is the relative phase between the chiral and achiral contributions to the emission amplitude .",
    "thus , the standard measure of the chiral signal , when applied to high harmonic yield , is proportional to @xmath145  the chiral part of hhg response .",
    "an exciting goal is to separately reconstruct the * amplitude * @xmath146 and the relative * phase * @xmath147 of the chiral response .",
    "this can be done by augmenting the measurement of @xmath148 with two more measurements : ( i ) of the relative harmonic phase @xmath149 between the @xmath71 and @xmath72 molecules , and ( ii ) of the harmonic amplitude in the racemic mixture @xmath150 .",
    "eq.([eq : dysonhhg22 ] ) allows us to explicitly calculate @xmath151 : @xmath152\\big [ d^{(0)}+\\mu \\delta d_{\\rm ch }   \\big]^{*}\\approx|d^{(0)}|^2+\\mu\\delta d_{\\rm ch}^{*}d^{(0)}-\\mu\\delta d_{\\rm ch}d^{(0 ) * } , \\label{eq : dysonhhg2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected the second order terms in @xmath7 .",
    "thus , @xmath153 since the sign of @xmath154 becomes important , we specify that @xmath155 $ ] . adding @xmath156 and @xmath157 we obtain @xmath158 where @xmath159 gives access to the relative amplitude of the chiral component :",
    "@xmath160 the dependence of @xmath159 on @xmath150 can be further eliminated by performing the harmonic measurements in the racemic mixture ( rm ) .",
    "suppose this measurement yields the harmonic spectrum @xmath161 ( also normalized to the signal for @xmath84 ) .",
    "then , the amplitude of the chiral component can be obtained as follows : @xmath162    on the other hand , combining eqs.([eq : q]),([eq : w ] ) we obtain the phase between the chiral and achiral components : @xmath163 thus , both the amplitude and the relative phase of the chiral signal can be obtained from the combination of spectral and amplitude measurements .",
    "the result described by eqs.([eq : w],[eq : ach ] , [ eq : phase ] ) is in fact more general then may appear at first glance : eq.([eq : dysonhhg22 ] ) may equally apply to chiral dynamics initiated in a neutral molecule and then probed with hhg .",
    "this scheme is sketched in fig.3 .",
    "such pump - probe scheme could allow one to probe the evolution of chiral component @xmath164 in neutral species during structural changes on a longer , femtosecond time scale .",
    "this time scale is determined by the delay between the pump pulse , which excites chiral dynamics in the neutral molecule , and the probe pulse which generates the chiral - sensitive high harmonic signal .",
    "up to now , no pump - probe time - resolved measurement of ultrafast chirality has been done in the gas phase due to the absence of sufficiently sensitive technique .",
    "chhg promises to open this direction .",
    "and therefore changes the high harmonic response induced by the hhg probe .",
    "thus , hhg allows one to follow chiral response from sub fs to fs time scale .",

    "using the example of epoxypropane molecule , we have shown theoretically that chhg method should strongly benefit from the application of the two - color , counter - rotating elliptically polarized fields .",
    "application of such fields should lead to much higher values of circular dichroism compared to the original scheme @xcite , which relied on weakly elliptical fields .",
    "we predict that the combination of the harmonic amplitude and phase measurements should allow one to directly measure enantiomeric excess in a concentration - independent way and monitor the evolution of the chiral dynamics with sub - femtosecond time resolution .",
    "we have shown how chhg method can be used to extract both the amplitude and phase of the chiral signal , for arbitrary configurations of laser fields used to initiate high harmonic process .",
    "indeed , the analysis in section 3 does not assume any specific field configuration .",
    "we predict that eqs.([eq : w],[eq : ach],[eq : phase ] ) can also be used to extract the amplitude and the phase of the chiral signal from the hhg observables in the pump - probe set - up . in this setup",
    "chiral dynamics is first excited in a neutral molecule and then probed with chiral - sensitive high harmonic signal . from single shot to pump - probe , chhg driven by tailored laser fields thus enables imaging of a wide range of chiral dynamics , with time resolution extended from sub - femtosecond to many tens of femtoseconds .",
