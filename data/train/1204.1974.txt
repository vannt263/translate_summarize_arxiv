    "ninety years after the great debate on the the nature of `` spiral nebulae '' @xcite , our knowledge about disc galaxies has grown considerably . however , the processes responsible for their spiral appearance are still under scrutiny .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed , the widely accepted one being the triggering of a long - lived density wave that moves as a solid body , with constant pattern speed @xcite .",
    "one can define the corotation radius as the point at which gas and stars move with the same speed as the spiral pattern . since the rotation velocity of gas and stars is roughly independent of radius , the regions inside ( outside ) the corotation radius will move faster ( slower ) than the spiral arm pattern .",
    "the gas component piles up in the spiral arms , experiencing a shock that gives rise to star formation @xcite .",
    "one would expect in this scenario that the youngest stars born from the molecular clouds in the spiral arms would be found slightly ahead of the arm traced by the molecular gas , if located within the corotation radius , and behind the arm outside of corotation .",
    "therefore , if we observe the tracers of the different stages of star formation , such as hi , co and h@xmath1 , we expect to find an offset among them as a function of the radius",
    ". there are a number of observational efforts to detect such offset in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and more recently ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of these studies measure the angular offsets between co as a tracer of star forming molecular clouds and h@xmath1 and/or @xmath3 m as a tracer of young stars . a time difference around a few myr",
    "is found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) between co and h@xmath1 .",
    "we note that hi is not necessarily a direct tracer of molecular cloud formation , as it often results from molecular gas dissociation caused by star formation activity @xcite .",
    "a stronger constraint can be imposed if we target instead tracers that cover a wider range of ages for the distribution of recently formed sources .",
    "the use of uv light opens up this possibility , since stellar populations can be tracked over the first few hundred myr @xcite .",
    "an alternative mechanism for the triggering of spiral arms involves self - gravitational instabilities @xcite whose spiral features have much shorter lifetimes .",
    "numerical simulations have not been capable of explaining the onset of a stable density wave with constant pattern speed , whereas short - lived spiral arms appear naturally ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other processes , like tidal interactions or star - formation induced structures have been proposed as well , leaving a different imprint on the properties of the underlying stellar populations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we make use of the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board the _ swift _ spacecraft @xcite , to study in detail the star forming regions of a nearby grand - design spiral .",
    "ngc4321 ( m100 ) is a face - on late - type spiral galaxy ( sabbc ) towards the virgo cluster @xcite . even though _ swift _ is an observatory built for the study of transient phenomena , most notably gamma ray bursts , the resolution of uvot makes it an optimal instrument to study star formation in nearby galaxies .",
    "the presence of a recent supernova in ngc4321 ( sn2006x , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) triggered a number of follow - up observations with _ swift_/uvot , allowing us to put together one of the deepest uv images of a nearby galaxy at a spatial resolution of 2.5arcsec ( fwhm ) over a @xmath4  arcmin@xmath5 field of view . in this paper",
    "we adopt the distance from the hubble space telescope key project to measure hubble s constant @xcite , with a distance modulus @xmath6  mag , implying a distance of 15.2  mpc , and an angular scale of 73.7  pc / arcsec .",
    "the scale length of the disc of ngc4321 is h=1.39  arcmin or 6.15  kpc measured in the v band @xcite .",
    "we use this value as a characteristic disc length throughout this paper .",
    "the radial positions of the sources are deprojected by using an inclination of 38@xmath7 , with the receding side located at a position angle of 151@xmath7 @xcite .",
    ".log of _ swift_/uvot observations of ngc4321 used in this paper .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     the distributions found in fig .",
    "[ fig : denswave ] can be naturally explained if the spiral arm is `` corotating '' with the stars and the gas , i.e. if the spiral pattern speed decreases with galactocentric radius .",
    "recent numerical simulation studies @xcite claim that such corotating spiral arms are more naturally developed in numerical simulations . indeed , it is rather difficult to reproduce the spiral density wave theory in numerical simulations with self - gravity @xcite .",
    "such corotating spiral arms suffer from the winding problem , but are found to be disrupted within a time - scale of a few hundreds of myr ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and a snapshot of the evolving galaxy at any time always shows some spiral arm structure .",
    "@xcite also demonstrate that in such corotating spiral arms gas falls into the spiral arms both from behind and the front of the spiral arm and collides , inducing star formation in the arm .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the observed distribution of star forming sources presented here .",
    "the resolution of the _ swift_/uvot camera makes it an optimal instrument to explore the young star forming sources in nearby late - type galaxies . in combination with optical photometry ,",
    "it is possible to disentangle the contribution from the more diffuse , older component , giving an estimate of the age and dust content of the young stars responsible for the nuv emission . in this study",
    ", we combine deep uvot imaging in the nuv with optical and ir archival imaging to study the properties of 787 star forming regions in the spiral structure of ngc4321 , out to r@xmath83h .",
    "we find a strong trend of brighter h@xmath1 sources in the central regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rad ] , see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the ages , or the dust content of the star forming regions do not present a measurable correlation with galactocentric distance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ages ] ) , suggesting that the strong trend in h@xmath1 flux is caused by a larger number of massive star forming sources in the central regions ( assuming a universal stellar initial mass function ) .",
    "the presence of dust is revealed when stacking up the photometric seds of the sources according to their nuv - optical colour , with significant excess at @xmath9 m for the bluest ( and youngest ) ones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] ) .",
    "however , a quantitative analysis of the dust reddening from the photometric data gives rather low `` spatial resolution averaged '' values of e(b ",
    "v)@xmath100.2  mag .",
    "the main outcome of the comparison with stellar populations is that one can use uvw2g colours as a proxy of the age of the younger component , ranging from a few myr to a few hundred myr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ages ] ) .",
    "the properties of these sources enable us to study the effect of the spiral structure , a powerful test of pattern formation in disc galaxies .",
    "the standard scenario of density wave theory with a constant pattern speed results in an offset with respect to age for the distribution of distances to the spiral arms as one moves from the central regions  where the gas moves faster than the pattern  to the outer disc ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : denswave ] , left ) .",
    "the advantage of uv imaging over studies based on comparisons between the gas component and hii/@xmath3 m regions is the wider time baseline spanned by uv light , roughly of order 100  myr .",
    "no significant differences are found in the distribution of these sources , giving further negative evidence for density wave spirals .",
    "our findings reject the possibility that the results from @xcite  giving no offsets between co and h@xmath1 over a narrower range ( r@xmath11 )  can be explained by a radial coincidence with corotation .",
    "instead , a scenario with short - lived corotating spiral arms is compatible with the data .",
    "such structures have been found in numerical simulations of spiral galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying a fundamental change of our views from the traditional concept of long - lived spiral arms .",
