    "physical and astrophysical diagnostics via supernova ( sn ) neutrino detection in underground detectors represent a subject of intense investigation in astroparticle physics .",
    "a lot of attention has been devoted to possible signatures of the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) matter effect  @xcite on the neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae ( sne )  @xcite . lately",
    ", novel phenomena have been found to be important in the region close to the neutrinosphere where the neutrino density is such that the neutrino - neutrino interactions dominate the flavor evolution .",
    "neutrino self - interactions are responsible for large coherent conversions between different flavors ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "neutrino oscillations in sne could imprint peculiar signatures on the observable neutrino signal , sensitive to the neutrino mass and mixing , and to the unknown mass hierarchy  @xcite .    due to the uncertainties in the calculation of the primary sn neutrino spectra",
    ", it seems difficult to establish oscillation effects solely on the basis of theoretical expectations .",
    "therefore the importance of relatively model - independent signatures has been emphasized in the recent literature , e.g. in association with the prompt @xmath2 neutronization burst  @xcite , with the rise time of the early neutrino signal  @xcite , or with matter effects associated to the shock - wave propagation at late times  @xcite .",
    "one unequivocal signature would be the observation of the earth matter effects  @xcite .",
    "they induce a characteristic energy - dependent modulation on the measured flux when sn neutrinos cross the earth matter before being detected .",
    "earth matter effects could be measured in a single detector , if it has enough energy resolution and statistics to track the wiggles in the observed energy spectrum .",
    "a fourier analysis of the sn neutrino signal has been proposed as a powerful tool to diagnose this modulation  @xcite . moreover , the comparison of the signals from shadowed and unshadowed detectors may allow one to diagnose the earth effects even if a single detector could not resolve the modulations  @xcite .",
    "recent supernova simulations indicate lower average energies than previously expected  @xcite and a tendency towards the equalization of the neutrino fluxes during the cooling phase , i.e. for post - bounce times @xmath3  s  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this trend eases the agreement of theoretical expectations with sn 1987a data  @xcite .",
    "motivated by this new input and since the observability of the earth matter effect largely depends on the neutrino average energies and on the flavor - dependent differences among the primary spectra , we find worthwhile to reevaluate the detectability of the earth matter effects in large detectors .",
    "we refer to three classes of detectors proposed for low - energy neutrino physics and astrophysics , viz .",
    "water cherenkov ( wc ) detectors with fiducial masses of @xmath4(400 ) kton  @xcite , liquid scintillation ( sc ) detectors with masses of @xmath4(50 ) kton  @xcite , and liquid argon time projection chambers ( lar tpc ) with fiducial masses of @xmath4(100 ) kton  @xcite .",
    "these three detection techniques are the backbones of the european project laguna ( large apparati for grand unification and neutrino astrophysics )  @xcite and the lbne ( long baseline neutrino experiment ) towards dusel ( deep underground science and technology laboratory ) in the us  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the project of the mton - class wc detector hyper - kamiokande is currently discussed in japan  @xcite . in particular , wc and",
    "sc neutrino experiments are mostly sensitive to sn @xmath5 through the inverse beta decay process @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "lar tpc would have a high sensitivity to sn @xmath2 s , through the charged current interactions of @xmath2 with the ar nuclei in the detector .",
    "we also consider the icecube ice cherenkov detector  @xcite as `` co - detector '' to monitor the earth effect in comparison with the energy - integrated signal measured in a mton wc detector  @xcite .",
    "for all these detectors , we find that no signature of the earth matter effect is observable for a typical galactic sn at @xmath7  kpc . in the more optimistic case of a close - by sn at @xmath8  kpc",
    ", the chances to detect the earth matter signature appear statistically weak in the antineutrino signal .",
    "conversely , a signal would show up in the @xmath2 signal detectable at a lar tpc",
    ". the earth matter signal would be detectable with high significance in both neutrino and antineutrino signals for relatively close by stars which might evolve into core - collapse sne at unpredictable future times , like betelgeuse , mira ceti and antares ( at @xmath9  kpc )  provided that the electronics of the detector will be able to cope with such a huge rate of events .",
    "our results allow us to conclude that the previous paradigm on the observability of the sn neutrino earth matter effects was based on an `` optimistic '' choice of the non - oscillated neutrino fluxes , not anymore confirmed by the most recent and less approximated sn simulations .",
    "the plan of our work is as follow . in sec .",
    "ii we present the neutrino signal from sn hydrodynamical simulations we adopt as benchmark for our study . in sec .",

    "the self - induced effects would take place within @xmath47  km from the neutrinosphere whereas the msw transitions take place at larger radii , in the region @xmath48@xmath49  km .",

    "indeed , it is expected that self - induced flavor oscillations would be no longer inhibited by the ordinary matter density and multiple spectral splits should occur  @xcite . however , since the spectral differences among different flavors are not large ( see fig .  [",

    ". this would reduce the possibility to observe any signature of earth matter effects .",
    "moreover , it is expected that at @xmath53  s the non - adiabatic effects associated with the matter turbulences in the supernova envelope would produce a smearing of the msw flavor conversions  @xcite further reducing the spectral differences . in the following",

    "( [ eq : nh])([eq : ih ] ) during the cooling phase too , since we are interested in the time - integrated signal .",
    "our approach is conservative , since the experimental detectability of the earth matter signature would be even more challenging than in our simplified scenario .",
    "if the supernova is shadowed by the earth for a detector  @xcite , neutrinos will travel a certain distance through the earth and therefore will undergo earth matter oscillations during their propagation . since neutrinos arrive at the earth as mass eigenstates , the net effect of oscillations can be written in terms of the conversion probabilities @xmath54 . for large @xmath0 , the neutrino fluxes at the earth are  @xcite @xmath55 and for antineutrinos @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 while propagating through the earth .",

    "the earth crossing induces a peculiar oscillatory signature in the energy spectra and from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nh])([eme - nubar ] ) , one would expect the earth matter effect for antineutrinos in nh and for neutrinos in ih .",
    "the typical event rate associated with an inverse beta decay process is @xmath66 , the cross section being @xmath67 . whereas the distance between the energy - spectrum peaks due to the earth modulation increases with energy , the peaks are nearly equally spaced in the inverse energy spectrum . in order to show this behavior , it is useful to recast the @xmath2 and @xmath5 fluxes as  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the energy - dependent difference of the primary neutrino spectra and @xmath70 ; we also defined the mass squared difference in the earth @xmath71 and the `` inverse energy variable '' @xmath72 .",
    "analogous definitions hold in the antineutrino sector in terms of the difference of the antineutrino spectra and of @xmath64 .",

    "we find that , since during this phase the spectral differences among different flavors are very small , no peak in the power spectrum appears even in the optimistic case of a very close - by sn ( results not shown here ) .    as anticipated in the previous sections , the recent supernova simulations point towards mean energies that are lower than previously considered in the literature and and fluxes that are closer among themselves during the cooling phase . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , these spectral features generate a destructive interference in the power spectrum sometimes responsible for the appearance of a double peak and suppress the intensity of the expected earth peak ( see also figs .  [",
    "fig : parametric],[fig : double - peak ] ) .",
    "moreover , we take into account the time - dependence of the neutrino fluxes and discuss a time - integrated analysis for both the accretion and the cooling phase . therefore an eventual enhancement of the power spectrum peak due to a lucky choice of the spectral parameters ( i.e. , a choice of the initial fluxes corresponding to a particular post - bounce time , as in the existing literature ) could be averaged out with the time integration . of course , despite the major improvements on the simulations side over the last decade ( e.g. on dimensionality , weak interaction physics , general relativity , etc . )",
    "one can not exclude that the current supernova paradigm is oversimplified and forthcoming supernova simulations , including effects not yet considered ( or new physics ) , might point towards an enhancement of the differences among the neutrino fluxes , allowing a better resolution for the earth peak .",

    "therefore , together with a high - statistics mton wc detector it could detect the earth effect ( if only one of the two detectors is shadowed ) by the relative difference in the temporal signals  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig - icecube ] shows the ratio of the counting rate for icecube and for a 400 kton wc detector , taking the input for the un - oscillated @xmath10 fluxes from the accretion phase of the 15 @xmath26 garching model .",
    "the counting rate in icecube also includes the noise from the photomultipliers ( 280 hz per optical module ) .",
    "we assume that the wc detector is un - shadowed . in the case",
    "that icecube is shadowed we indicate the ratio of events with squares , while when icecube is un - shadowed the ratio is plotted with circles .",
    "the left panel represents the ratio for a sn at 10 kpc , the central at 1 kpc , and the right at 0.2 kpc , respectively . in all the cases ,",
    "we employ the time - dependent values of the parameters @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 as obtained from 15 @xmath26 garching model .",
    "note also that the shape of the ratio changes with the distance of the sn , since the measured signal in icecube is the sum of a time - independent background rate ( independent of the distance ) and a true sn lightcurve whose normalization depends on the distance .",
    "the left panel clearly shows that the ratio with and without earth matter effects are nearly inseparable for a sn at @xmath130  kpc , since the statistical errors are larger than the difference . for a sn at @xmath8  kpc ,",
    "the ratio in the shadowed and un - shadowed case still have too large statistical errors to be clearly separated .",
    "conversely , the shadowed and un - shadowed cases are statistically separable at @xmath136  kpc . however , since the differences between the two curves are relatively small ( maximum difference @xmath141 at @xmath142  ms ) and the the initial neutrino fluxes are not known with such precision , it is unlikely that the ratio of events could be used to diagnose the earth effect , unless the comparison can be performed between two _ very similar _ detectors , with systematics canceling out . otherwise , moderate variations in the distance of the sn events or the time - dependence used for the parameters ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) may alone alter the `` reference '' curve with respect to which compared an eventual signal .",
    "the earth matter effect in supernova neutrinos would be an interesting tool to diagnose the neutrino mass hierarchy at `` large '' @xmath0 . motivated by the recent measurement of this angle  @xcite and by the vivid discussion for future large underground neutrino detectors , we found worthwhile to reevaluate the chance to detect this effect in future neutrino experiments . in order to achieve a realistic characterization of this signature",
    ", we adopted state - of - the - art sn simulation inputs  @xcite to describe the un - oscillated sn neutrino signal .",
    "the detection of the modulation in the neutrino spectra induced by the earth crossing largely depends on the neutrino average energies and on the flavor - dependent differences between the primary spectra . at this",
    "regard , recent supernova simulations indicate lower average energies than previously expected  @xcite and a tendency towards the equalization of the neutrino fluxes of different flavors during the cooling phase  @xcite .",
    "this makes the detection of the earth matter effect more challenging than what assumed in previous works based on outdated sn simulations .    in order to diagnose the modulation in the sn @xmath10 energy spectrum induced by the earth crossing",
    ", we perform a fourier analysis of the neutrino signal in a 400 kton wc detector , in a 50 kton liquid sc and in a 100 kton lar tpc .",
    "for all these detectors , we found that coming from a typical galactic sn at @xmath130  kpc , no signature of the earth matter effect is observable in the measured sn neutrino burst .",
    "moreover , also in the more optimistic case of a close - by sn at @xmath8  kpc , the chances to detect the earth matter signature appear statistically weak in the antineutrino signal .",
    "conversely , a signal would show up in the @xmath2 signal detectable at a lar tpc . only for relatively close stars which might evolve into core - collapse supernovae at unpredictable future times like betelgeuse , mira ceti , and antares ( at @xmath9  kpc )",
    ", the earth matter signal would be detectable with high significance in both neutrino and antineutrino signals .",
    "finally , icecube taken as co - detector to monitor the earth effect together with a mton wc detector is not able to detect any sizeable variation in the sn neutrino event rate associated with the earth matter effect for any galactic supernova .",
    "these new results based on the state - of - art sn simulations dramatically change the previous perspectives of detection of the earth matter effect with supernova neutrinos based on an outdated choice for the primary sn neutrino fluxes , as reported from previous supernova simulations .",
    "in particular , mton wc detectors and large liquid scintillators would be able to observe the earth matter signature only for very - close by ( and rare ) sne , provided that the electronics of the detector will be able to cope with huge rates of events .",
    "a 100 kton lar tpc which starts to monitor the earth signature from sne at a distance of few kpc from the earth , would statistically have @xmath143% of chance to see this signature from the next galactic supernova explosion  @xcite .    as a consequence of our finding , the possibility to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy with the next galactic sn neutrino burst requires to be rediscussed .",
    "of course , a caveat is that , while current sn simulations have improved in many ways with respect to one or two decades ago , the results obtained should still be considered as indicative , and an empirical test would certainly be welcome . turning the argument around",
    ", we can say that  barring an exceptional situation of a close - by sn  a positive detection of the earth matter effect in future data would come as a surprise and probably invalidate the current models .",
    "a negative result most likely would turn into constrains in the flavor flux difference vs. average energy differences parameter space , thus indirectly testing these models .",
    "of course , this should not discourage experimentalists to devote efforts to achieve a detailed measurement of the neutrino flux and spectra from a galactic supernova ; it would be `` per se '' a bonanza for testing the astrophysical models and the detailed understanding of the core - collapse sn mechanism .    if earth matter effect in sne",
    "is now not so promising as thought before , there are still other intriguing signatures in the sn neutrino signal that could give important information on the mass hierarchy . in particular , the early @xmath2 neutronization peak that could be detected in a mton wc detector or in a large lar tpc would provide a clear signature to extract the neutrino mass hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "also the early signal rise during the accretion phase , detectable by all the detectors discussed in this work , could encode an imprint of the neutrino mass ordering  @xcite . in conclusion ,",

    "<S> we find that none of the proposed detectors shall be able to detect the earth modulation for the neutrino signal of a typical galactic sn at 10  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> it should be observable in a 100 kton liquid argon detector for a sn at few kpc and all three detectors would clearly see the earth signature for very close - by stars only ( @xmath1  kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that adopting icecube as co - detector together with a mton water cherenkov detector is not a viable option either . </S>"
