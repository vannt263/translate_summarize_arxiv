    "the alice detector  @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is within the crossover region in the qcd - phase diagram , i.e , in the region of very low net - baryon - density and high temperature .",
    "the main aim of the alice experiment is to study the strongly interacting matter at this extreme energy density and temperature , where the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected .",
    "the understanding of deconfinement and the chiral symmetry restoration are other vital studies .",
    "+ event - by - event fluctuations , such as , fluctuations of mean transverse momentum , net charge , multiplicity , higher moments , particle ratios , etc . , basically provide information on the details of the dynamics of the colliding system .",
    "large numbers of produced particles in each event make these studies possible .",
    "the qcd phase transition can manifest itself by characteristic behaviour of the observables which vary dramatically from one event to another . following the properties of the grand canonical ensemble ( gce )  @xcite",
    ", the variance ( @xmath3 ) of the charged - particle multiplicity distribution is connected to a thermodynamic quantity , which is the isothermal compressibility ( @xmath4 ) of the produced system as  @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath1 is the mean multiplicity and @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "therefore , the multiplicity fluctuation expressed in terms of the scaled variance ( @xmath7 ) is directly proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4 increases by  an order of magnitude close to the qcd critical point ( cp ) , following a power - law scaling with critical exponent @xmath8 , which basically has the identical value for the same universality class of systems .",
    "@xmath9 thus , it is also possible to group the systems into universality classes ( this is a grouping of systems in the nature )  @xcite .",
    "dynamical fluctuations ( other than the statistical fluctuations and fluctuations in the number of participants ) and multiplicity distribution measurements provide constraints on the particle production models . measurements at vanishing @xmath10 set the scale of the theoretical calculations .",
    "besides , at lhc energies , values of bjorken - x below @xmath11 can be accessed , where initial state effects can be studied with multiplicity measurements  @xcite .",
    "model calculations with cgc initial energy distributions have shown that experimental multiplicity distributions from @xmath12 collisions at rhic are better explained if multiplicity fluctuations are included  @xcite .",
    "the analysis has been performed using 14 m minimum bias pb - pb events .",
    "the data for the analysis were taken at @xmath13  tev .",
    "the following detectors have been used for this analysis : silicon pixel detectors ( spd ) for vertex determination , v0 ( forward detectors ) for centrality selection and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) for charge - particle selection .",
    "charged particles are selected within @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "centrality is selected using the charged - particle minimum - bias distribution of the v0 amplitude .",
    "the centrality percentile is determined by fitting the minimum - bias distribution with the glauber model , thus connecting the measured multiplicity to the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath16 ) and number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "due to the non - uniformity in charged - particle distributions , the centrality binwidth effect ( cbw ) arises .",
    "the prescription is to divide one centality bin into smaller bins and weight the moments as , @xmath18 where the index @xmath19 runs over each multiplicity bin , @xmath20 represents various moments for the @xmath19-th bin , and @xmath21 is the number of events in the @xmath19-th multiplicity bin .",
    "@xmath22 is the total number of events in the centrality bin  @xcite .",
    "final results will be shown for @xmath23  centrality bins , after applying the bin width correction .",
    "the scaled variance depends on the fluctuations of @xmath16 . according to heiselberg  @xcite , considering the participant model ,",
    "the scaled variance can be written as , @xmath24 where @xmath25  is the mean multiplicity of hadrons from a nucleon - nucleon source and @xmath26  is the scale of the fluctuation in @xmath16 .",
    "tev for @xmath14  and  @xmath27 , as obtained by a hijing simulation . ]",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows results for @xmath26  from hijing .",
    "it is observed that by choosing narrow bins in centrality , fluctuations in @xmath16 are minimized . in this case",
    ", the scale of the fluctuation in @xmath16 is close to unity .",
    "detector efficiency ( @xmath28 ) generally is defined as the fraction of the number of accepted tracks from primary particles to the number of all primary particles . for alice ,",
    "@xmath28  is not a constant , rather it has a non - flat @xmath29 dependence . to correct for these local efficiency effects ( following the prescription given in  @xcite )",
    ", 9 @xmath29 intervals have been used for each centrality , and for each such bin , @xmath28-values are calculated and the numbers of charged particles are counted .",
    "thus , the corrected factorial moments are calculated , from which we get efficiency - corrected values for @xmath1 , @xmath2  and  @xmath30 .",
    "in figure  [ fig2 ] , the result for the scaled variance ( @xmath30 ) is shown as a function of the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainty for @xmath30  is  @xmath31 .",
    "the main sources of the systematic uncertainties are the resolution effect , changing track and vertex selection criteria , different magnetic field polarity , tracking efficiency and data cleanup .",
    "we observe that the scaled variance is decreasing slowly from peripheral ( @xmath32  3.6 ) to central ( @xmath32  2.8 ) collisions .",
    "neither hijing , nor ampt ( with string melting option ) can describe the trend from data , though the results from the models are of comparable values as from data .",
