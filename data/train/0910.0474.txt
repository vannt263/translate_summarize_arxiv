    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains two higgs doublets @xmath1 and @xmath2 coupling to up- and down - type quark fields , respectively . the neutral components of these higgs doublets acquire vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the sum @xmath5 being fixed to @xmath6 and the ratio @xmath7 remaining as a free parameter .",
    "large values of @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) are theoretically motivated by bottom - top yukawa unification , which occurs in so(10 ) gut models with minimal yukawa sector , and phenomenologically preferred by the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xcite .",
    "since a large value of @xmath0 corresponds to @xmath9 , it leads to enhanced corrections in amplitudes where the tree - level contribution is suppressed by the small vev @xmath4 but the loop - correction involves @xmath3 instead . in such cases",
    "the ratio of one - loop to tree - level contribution receives an enhancement - factor @xmath0 which may lift the loop - suppression rendering the ratio of order @xmath10 .    in order not to spoil the perturbative expansion a special treatment is required for these @xmath0-enhanced corrections to resum them to all orders .",
    "there are two possible ways to deal with them .",
    "the first is to consider an effective theory with the susy particles intgrated out keeping only higgs fields and sm particles @xcite .",
    "this approach is valid for @xmath11 , i.e. within the decoupling limit ; it can be extended beyond using an iterative method @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is to perform a diagrammatic , analytic resummation in the full mssm without assuming any hierarchy between @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "going beyond the decoupling limit is desirable since on the one hand @xmath15 is natural and on the other hand @xmath0-enhanced effects in couplings involving susy particles like gluinos and neutralinos can not be studied in an effective theory with these particles integrated out . in this article",
    "i will present the main results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the diagrammatic resummation method of ref .",
    "@xcite has been extended to the case of flavour - changing interactions .",
    "at tree - level the mass of the bottom quark @xmath17 is generated by coupling the @xmath18-quark to the higgs - field @xmath2 and it is thus proportional to the small vev @xmath4 . at one - loop it receives @xmath0-enhanced self - energy corrections ( involving @xmath3 instead of @xmath4 ) from gluino - sbottom- , chargino - stop- and neutralino - sbottom - loops , which i parameterise as @xmath19    these corrections",
    "modify the relation between the yukawa - coupling @xmath16 and the @xmath20 mass @xmath17 . within the decoupling limit",
    "the resulting resummation formula is given by @xcite @xmath21    beyond the decoupling limit the form of the resummation formula actually depends on the choice of renormalisation scheme for the input parameters in the sbottom sector .",
    "neclecting @xmath0-suppressed terms , the sbottom mass matrix reads @xmath22 it is diagonalised by a mixing matrix @xmath23 involving a mixing angle @xmath24 and a phase @xmath25 : @xmath26    if one takes the elements of the mass matrix @xmath27 as input , the paramters @xmath28 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are fixed by the diagonalisation procedure , i.e. they are not free parameters but functions of the elements of @xmath27 . on the other hand",
    ", can also take @xmath28 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( or other combinations of parameters ) directly as input .",
    "note that it is not possible to distinguish between different schemes for the input parameteres in the limit @xmath29 because @xmath30 beyond the decoupling limit , however , different choices for the set of input parameters lead to different resummation formulae for @xmath16 , which are shown in table [ tab : schemedep ] . here , only the gluino - contribution @xmath31 of @xmath32 is considered ; formulae including also the chargino- and the neutralino - contribution as well as explicit expressions for @xmath31 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be found in ref .",

    "in the last section i briefly discussed the consequences of @xmath0-enhanced contributions to the @xmath18-quark self - energy @xmath35 .",
    "let us now have a look at the corresponding flavour - changing self - energies and let us focus on @xmath36 transitions @xmath37 for definiteness . in the framework of naive mfv as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is considered here , the gluino- and neutralino - couplings are flavour - diagonal at tree - level .",
    "therefore only chargino diagrams generate a @xmath0-enhanced contribution to @xmath37 which can be parameterised analogously to eq .",
    "( [ eq : flavconsselfen ] ) as @xmath38    now consider the generic situation of a @xmath37-subdiagram in an external quark leg of some feynman diagram ( fig .",

    "the quark propagator @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is set to zero ) cancels the factor @xmath17 in @xmath37 , the resulting feynman amplitude is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the part of @xmath43 corresponding to the truncated diagram .",
    "therefore , if @xmath0 is large enough to compensate for the loop - factor @xmath44 , it is possible to get a @xmath36 transition without paying the price of a loop suppression . in this way",
    "one finds @xmath0-enhanced corrections to fcnc @xmath36 processes by sourcing the flavour change out into an external quark leg rendering the underlying loop - diagram flavour - diagonal . as an example consider the susy - contribution to @xmath45 : for large @xmath0 the one - loop amplitude is dominated by the chargino - stop diagram giving a contribution of the form @xmath46 .",
