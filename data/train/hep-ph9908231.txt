    "the top quark has an exceptionally large mass of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and is naturally expected to have a close connection to new physics  @xcite . the run  1 of the fermilab tevatron collider has successfully ended with the discovery of the top quark , but has yielded only a relatively small number of top quark events , which leaves plenty of room for new physics to be uncovered with the tevatron upgrade  @xcite in the near future . due to higher statistics , the @xmath4 sample at the upgraded tevatron is expected to provide a sensitive probe of new physics  @xcite .    a most popular model of new physics is the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) . in this model ,",
    "the discrete multiplicative symmetry of @xmath0-parity , defined by @xmath5 with spin @xmath6 , baryon number @xmath7 and lepton number @xmath8 , is often imposed on the lagrangian to maintain the separate conservation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this conservation requirement is , however , not dictated by any fundamental principle such as gauge invariance or renormalizability .",
    "the finiteness of the neutrino mass as suggested by the super - kamiokande and several other neutrino experiments  @xcite also implies that lepton numbers may be violated .- violating interactions of the @xmath0-violating mssm can give rise to neutrino masses at the one - loop level  @xcite . ]",
    "the most general superpotential of the mssm consistent with the @xmath9 symmetry and supersymmetry contains @xmath0-violating interactions which are given by  @xcite @xmath10 here @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) are the left - handed lepton ( quark ) doublet and right - handed lepton ( quark ) singlet chiral superfields , and @xmath16 denotes charge conjugation .",
    "@xmath17 are the higgs chiral superfields .",
    "the indices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 denote generations and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the color indices .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the coupling constants of the @xmath8-violating interactions and @xmath26 those of the @xmath7-violating interactions .",
    "the non - observation ( so far ) of the proton decay imposes very strong constraints on the product of the @xmath8-violating and @xmath7-violating couplings  @xcite .",
    "it is thus conventionally assumed in phenomenological studies that only one type of these interactions ( either @xmath8- or @xmath7-violating ) exists .",
    "constraints on these @xmath0-parity violating couplings have been obtained from various analyses  @xcite and some of their phenomenological implications at lepton  @xcite and hadron  @xcite colliders have been investigated .",
    "it is notable that the bounds on the couplings involving top quark are generally quite weak ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in the future precision top quark experiments at the upgraded tevatron",
    ", these couplings may either manifest themselves or subjected to further , stronger constraints .    in proton - antiproton collisions ,",
    "the @xmath8-violating top quark interaction @xmath25 can induce tree - level processes such as @xmath27 via slepton exchange in the @xmath2 channel .",
    "( here the subscript @xmath8 stands for chirality , not helicity . )",
    "similarly , the @xmath7-violating @xmath26 coupling gives rise to the process @xmath28 via squark exchange .",
    "since the couplings are chiral , these new production mechanisms produce an asymmetry between the left- and right - handed polarized top quarks .",
    "this polarization can be a sensitive probe for these couplings due to the fact that both the sm and @xmath0-conserving mssm contributions to the polarization are small and light gluino , which is disfavored by the existing experimental data , the polarization induced by supersymmetric weak and strong interactions could be significant , however  @xcite . ] .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contribution of these processes to the _ total _",
    "@xmath4 cross section was studied to constrain the relevant @xmath0-violating couplings .",
    "the effect is found to be at most of the level of a few percent .",
    "because of the uncertainties in the sm predictions of the @xmath29 production cross section and possible contributions from the @xmath0-_conserving _ mssm interactions  @xcite , the total @xmath4 cross section turns out not to be a suitable observable for the r - parity violating interactions . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility of probing the @xmath0-violating in several observables including the top quark polarization in @xmath4 production at the upgraded tevatron collider .",
    "the top polarization can serve as a sensitive probe of the r - parity violating interactions because of the negligibly small sm or mssm contribution .",

    "it is important to realize here that there is _ no interference _ with the qcd amplitude because of the orthogonal color structure .",

    "the polarization of @xmath37 can also be used to increase the statistical sensitivity of the data .",
    "the total polarizations @xmath76 and @xmath61 have the same magnitude but opposite in sign within our approximation , and the hemisphere @xmath37 polarization can be calculated from the expressions given above . to be conservative",

    "we assume for simplicity that only one of the couplings dominates . for the @xmath8-violating couplings , @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "are already strongly constrained by atomic parity violation and @xmath79 deep - inelastic scattering  @xcite , respectively .",
    "we may thus interpret our result as that on @xmath80 , in which case the scalar - tau is exchanged in the process . in the case of @xmath7-violating interactions ,",
    "none of the relevant couplings have been well constrained by other processes .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show the polarizations @xmath61 , @xmath81 , and @xmath55 normalized to @xmath82 versus the scalar - tau mass .",

    "the total polarization is smaller than hemisphere polarizations because of the cancellation between the two hemispheres .",
    "for the coupling @xmath80 ( @xmath84 ) , the backward ( forward ) polarization has the largest magnitude of the three . in spite of the smaller number of events , the statistical sensitivity of the backward ( forward ) polarization is higher than that of the total polarization , as may be seen from fig .",
    "3 . because of the small electroweak contribution ( much less than one per cent )",
    ", the top polarization can be a useful probe of the @xmath0-violating couplings .",

    "the size of the effect is similar to the polarizations .",
    "the total asymmetry is smaller than the asymmetries of each helicity top events .    the @xmath85 limit for @xmath80 ( @xmath84 ) , which is defined by eq .",
    "( [ error ] ) with @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , versus scalar - tau ( squark ) mass is shown in fig .  5 for the integrated luminosities of 2 fb@xmath88 ( run 2 ) and 30 fb@xmath88 ( run 3 ) .",
    "the current @xmath85 limits from @xmath89 decay at lep - i  @xcite are also shown for comparison .",
    "note that the limits on @xmath80 obtained from the decay @xmath90 depend on squark mass since the coupling @xmath80 contributes to this decay via the squark - quark loops .",
    "but our limits depend on the scalar - tau mass .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 and @xmath91 can provide complementary information for the coupling @xmath80 , and the upgraded 2 tev tevatron collider with @xmath92 fb@xmath88 or even lower luminosity can provide meaningful information on this kind of new physics .",
    "as the polarization grows with energy , one can probe further parameter space in the couplings and masses at higher energies .",
    "we have studied the possibility to probe the @xmath0-parity violating interactions of the top quark at the tevatron collider .",
    "obviously , @xmath0-violating decays of squarks provide a way to limit these interactions  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that even when the squark is rather heavy and the production cross section is low , the @xmath0-violating interactions can affect the top quark pair production cross section via slepton ( or squark ) exchange .",
    "as these couplings are chiral , their contributions can lead to sizable polarization and forward - backward asymmetry for the top quark , that exceed the level expected from the standard model electroweak interactions .",
    "hence , we expect that the forthcoming new runs at the tevatron collider with main injector can improve the constraints on those couplings .",
