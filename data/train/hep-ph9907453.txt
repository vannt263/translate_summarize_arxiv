    "the physics of the reaction @xmath4 in the kinematical domain where the photon virtuality is large compared to the hadronic invariant mass has recently been shown to be very interesting from a qcd point of view ( @xcite , see also the pioneering work by d. mller _ et al . _",
    "the reason is that this process factorizes  @xcite into a perturbatively calculable , short - distance dominated subprocess @xmath5 and a non - perturbative qcd matrix element we have called generalized distribution amplitude ( gda ) . in fact , this generalizes the factorization of the @xmath6@xmath7 transition form factor measured in @xmath8 , which has been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .    note that @xmath4 is related by crossing to deep virtual compton scattering on a meson , @xmath9 , which at large @xmath1 and small squared momentum transfer between the hadrons factorizes into a hard photon - parton scattering and a skewed ( i.e.  off - forward , non - forward , or non - diagonal ) parton distribution  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 and compton processes share many features , in particular their scaling behavior in @xmath1 and a helicity selection rule for the virtual photon .",
    "the reaction we are interested in is either @xmath11 or @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14    in the @xmath15 center - of - mass frame , choosing the @xmath16 axis along @xmath17 , natural variables are @xmath18 , the polar angle of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , the angle between the leptonic plane and the hadronic plane . to completely specify the kinematics",
    "one needs three further variables , which can be chosen as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath21 .    we shall also use the variable @xmath22 , defined as the light - cone fraction of momentum carried by @xmath23 with respect to the pion pair .",
    "it is related to @xmath18 through @xmath24",
    "the spacetime cartoon of the process one can derive from power counting and factorization arguments is shown in fig .  1 .    in the breit frame",
    "the real photon moves fast along @xmath25 and is scattered into an energetic hadronic system moving along @xmath26 .",
    "the hard part of this process takes place at the level of elementary constituents , and the minimal number of quarks and gluons compatible with conservation laws ( color etc . )",
    "emerge . at born level one",
    "has simply @xmath27 , but through a quark box the photons can also couple to two gluons .",
    "each quark or gluon carries a fraction @xmath16 or @xmath28 of the large light - cone momentum component @xmath29 .",
    "subsequently the soft part of the reaction , i.e.  hadronization into a pion pair , takes place .",
    "at leading order in @xmath30 one has for the hadronic tensor @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the metric tensor in transverse space .",
    "here we introduced for each quark flavor the generalized distribution amplitude @xmath33 in light cone gauge @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 depends on the quark light - cone fraction @xmath16 , on the kinematical variables @xmath22 and @xmath2 of the pions , and on its factorization scale .",
    "contracting with the photon polarization vectors we see that in order to give a nonzero @xmath36 amplitude the virtual photon must have the same helicity as the real one , in particular it must be transverse . as in the case of virtual compton scattering",
    "this is a direct consequence of chiral invariance in the collinear hard scattering process  @xcite .",
    "we also find that the @xmath10 amplitude is independent of @xmath1 at fixed @xmath22 and @xmath2 , up to logarithmic scaling violation to be discussed later .",
    "there will of course be power corrections in @xmath37 to this leading mechanism .",
    "an example is the hadronic component of the real photon , which might be modeled by vector meson dominance . from power counting arguments one obtains that this contribution is suppressed , as it is in virtual compton scattering .",
    "our process can also be treated within the operator product expansion , which allows for a systematic analysis of higher twist effects .",
    "the exclusive process we consider here may be seen as the limit of the inclusive reaction @xmath38 @xcite , when unlike in the bjorken limit the hadronic mass squared @xmath2 is not scaled up with @xmath1 but remains fixed and small enough for the final state @xmath39 to be saturated by the @xmath40 state .",
    "let us examine the connection to some aspects of the photon structure functions , pointing out the specificity of the present kinematical limit .",
    "the differential unpolarized cross section for the reaction @xmath41 is @xmath42\\ , x_b f^\\gamma_t+(1-y)f^\\gamma_l\\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in addition to the kinematical notation of section 2 we introduced @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the qed coupling , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the photon structure functions , the index indicating the polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "their connection to the other familiar set , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , is given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the pointlike contribution of a light quark with charge @xmath51 to @xmath45 and @xmath46 , computed at zeroth order in the strong coupling is @xmath52\\ln\\frac{(1-x_b)q^2}{x_b m_q^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{3em } -(2x_b-1)^2\\biggr\\},\\\\ f^\\gamma_l\\!&\\!=\\!&\\!\\frac{3\\alpha}{2\\pi}e_q^4 \\bigl\\{8x_b^2(1-x_b)\\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the bjorken limit , where @xmath53 .",
    "note that @xmath54 is to be understood here as an effective mass that regulates the divergence in the box diagram .",
    "we see that in the region of fixed @xmath2 with @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) , these functions are @xmath57 which shows the disappearance of the @xmath58 behavior in @xmath45 and the vanishing of @xmath46 as expected .",
    "let us also stress that the hadronic part of the photon structure function ( usually parameterized by a vector dominance ansatz ) , which in general is only suppressed by a factor @xmath58 with respect to the pointlike part , does not survive our particular limiting procedure .",
    "as already noted it becomes a @xmath59 correction .",
    "the physics contained in generalized distribution amplitudes goes beyond that of a @xmath60 distribution amplitude of a meson : since two hadrons are formed @xmath61 does not select their lowest fock states ; in this respect it is related to ordinary parton distributions and to fragmentation functions .",
    "if , however , @xmath62 is at or near the mass of a resonance with appropriate quantum numbers , such as an @xmath63 , it will contain physics of the distribution amplitude for the resonance and of its decay into two pions  @xcite .    the same crossing procedure that connects our @xmath15 process with deep virtual compton scattering allows one to relate generalized distribution amplitudes to skewed parton distributions by an analytic continuation in the invariant mass variable @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "whereas time reversal invariance constrains ordinary distribution amplitudes and parton distributions to be real valued functions up to convention dependent phases , our generalized distributions are _",
    "complex_. we notice in ( [ tensor ] ) that the hard scattering kernel at born level is purely real so that the imaginary part of the @xmath10 amplitude is due to @xmath64 ; it corresponds to rescattering and resonance formation in the soft transition from the partons to the final state hadron pair . in fact , watson s theorem allows to deduce the phase of @xmath65 from the phase shift analysis of @xmath40 scattering for @xmath62 not too large  @xcite .    up to now",
    "we have discussed generalized @xmath60 distribution amplitudes . beyond tree level in the hard scattering",
    "the hadron pair can however also originate from two gluons .",
    "since gluons are known to be important in fragmentation and in parton distributions , one can expect the generalized @xmath66 distribution to be of the same order as the one for @xmath60 .",
    "qcd radiative corrections to the hard scattering will as usual lead to logarithmic scaling violation . at this point",
    "it is useful to remember the analogy of our process with the transition @xmath67 .",
    "the evolution can be obtained from the hard scattering kernel alone and remains the same if we replace @xmath61 with the distribution amplitude of a meson with the appropriate quantum numbers , say an @xmath63 .",
    "the generalized distribution amplitudes thus follow the usual efremov - radyushkin - brodsky - lepage evolution  @xcite for a meson .",
    "notice the peculiarity of the present channel that generalized @xmath60 and @xmath68 distributions mix under evolution  @xcite .",
    "in @xmath69 collisions the process @xmath70 we want to study competes with bremsstrahlung , where the hadron pair @xmath71 originates from a virtual photon radiated off the lepton  @xcite .",
    "this process produces the pair in the @xmath72-odd channel and hence does not contribute for @xmath73 , in particular not for @xmath74 .",
    "its amplitude can be computed from the value of the timelike elastic form factor measured in @xmath75 . for pions",
    "its magnitude and phase are dominated by the @xmath76 meson peak in a broad mass region around 800 mev .",
    "the @xmath10 and bremsstrahlung processes interfere in the @xmath77 channel ; this provides an opportunity to study the @xmath10 contribution at _ amplitude _ level .",
    "thanks to the different charge conjugation properties of the two processes their interference term can be selected by the charge asymmetries @xmath78 or @xmath79 while it drops out in the corresponding charge averages .",
    "we note that bremsstrahlung has an amplitude with both real and imaginary parts , especially at values of @xmath62 where it is dominated by vector meson resonances , and in particular benefits from the @xmath76 peak at @xmath62 around 800 mev .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath15 process on @xmath18 and @xmath20 is entirely due to the decomposition of the @xmath40 final state into partial waves , while in the limit @xmath80 the interference contribution has an additional factor @xmath81 coming from the bremsstrahlung amplitude .",
    "this leads to very specific patterns which will help testing the helicity selection rules valid in the large-@xmath1 limit , and thus the applicability of our theoretical description , at a finite value of @xmath1 .",
    "we will show elsewhere  @xcite these distributions with specific model assumptions for the generalized distribution amplitudes .",
    "a new hadronic matrix element such as the generalized distribution amplitude is of great interest since it appears as a universal quantity in different processes .",
    "this is indeed the case as can be seen from an analysis of the electroproduction process",
    "@xmath82  @xcite .    the amplitude for deep electroproduction of one meson ( @xmath83 ,  ) in the forward region has been shown to factorize  @xcite as the convolution of a hard scattering kernel @xmath84 and two non - perturbative objects obeying their own qcd evolution equations ,    * a non - diagonal parton distribution  @xcite @xmath85 , * the distribution amplitude of the produced meson @xmath86 ,    as @xmath87    the introduction of generalized distribution amplitudes allows one to enlarge the scope of this factorization property to the case of non - resonant @xmath40 production .",
    "this means that non - resonant @xmath40 emission ( including the @xmath88 channel absent in @xmath76-decay ) will have the same scaling behavior as @xmath76-production .",
    "its amplitude is obtained in a straightforward way from  ( [ cfs ] ) by replacing @xmath89 .",
    "to our knowledge no data exist as yet for exclusive two - meson production in @xmath0-collisions in the kinematical domain where qcd factorization would enable us to extract generalized distribution amplitudes .",
    "an estimation of expected yields at various energies is under way  @xcite .",
    "promising experimental set - ups should be the high luminosity , medium energy @xmath90 colliders known as the b - factories at slac and kek .",
    "the hadronic physics potential of these new machines is greatly enhanced by this new instance of factorization .",
