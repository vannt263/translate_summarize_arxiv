    "( oh  39.7 + 1.5 , iras  18560 + 0638 , v1366 aql ) belongs to the group of type ii oh / ir stars , which can be defined as infrared point sources with a maximum of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) around @xmath9 , with the @xmath10 silicate band in absorption , and with oh maser emission in the 1612 mhz line ( habing @xcite ) .",
    "most of these objects show a long - period variability in the infrared and the oh maser emission ( engels @xcite ; herman & habing @xcite ) , although also a small fraction either varies irregularly with small amplitude or does not vary at all .",
    "oh / ir stars are surrounded by massive circumstellar envelopes composed of gas and small solid particles ( dust , grains ) . these circumstellar dust shells ( cds )",
    "are produced by the ejection of matter at large rates ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) and low velocities ( @xmath13 ) , and in some cases they totally obscur the underlying star . based on the luminosities ( @xmath14 ) , the periods ( 500d to 3000d ) and bolometric amplitudes ( @xmath15  mag ) , the kinematical properties and galactic distribution , the majority of oh / ir stars are highly evolved low and intermediate  mass stars populating the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ( habing @xcite ) . they extend the sequence of optical mira variables to longer periods , larger optical depths and higher mass loss rates ( engels et al .",
    "@xcite ; habing @xcite ; lepine et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the improvements of the observational techniques , especially at infrared wavelengths , and the elaboration of increasingly sophisticated theoretical models have provided a wealth of new information on the structure , the dynamics , and the evolution of the atmospheres and circumstellar shells of agb stars , although many details still remain to be clarified ( see the review by habing @xcite ) .",
    "a general picture has become widely accepted in which both the large amplitude pulsations and the acceleration by radiation pressure on dust contribute to the mass loss phenomenon for agb stars . from observations , correlations are found between the period and the infrared excess ( indicating the mass loss rate ) ( degioia  eastwood et al .",
    "@xcite ; jura @xcite ) , and between the period and the terminal outflow velocity ( heske @xcite ) . on the theoretical side",
    ", hydrodynamical models showed that due to the passage of shocks generated by the stellar pulsation the atmosphere is highly extended , thus enabling dust formation and the subsequent acceleration of the matter ( wood @xcite ; bowen @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusion of a detailed treatment of dust formation revealed a complex interaction between pulsation and dust formation , which results e.g.  in a layered dust distribution and affects the derived optical appearance ( fleischer et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; winters et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "until now most interpretations of observations as well as most theoretical models are based on the assumption of a spherically symmetric dust shell , often motivated by the circularity of the oh maser maps .",
    "however , observations show that some objects have substantial deviations from spherical symmetry ( e.g.  dyck et al.@xcite ; kastner & weintraub @xcite ; weigelt et al.@xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the asymmetries observed in many post  agb objects and planetary nebulae ( cf .",
    "iben @xcite ) may already start to develop during the preceding agb phase , which provides new challenges for the modeling of the mechanisms and processes determining the structure of the dust shells around agb stars .",
    "high spatial resolution observations can yield direct information on important properties of the dust shells around agb stars , such as the dimensions and geometry of the shell .",
    "therefore , such observations contribute additional strong constraints for the modeling of these circumstellar environments , which supplement the information from the spectral energy distribution .",
    "measurements of the visibility at near - ir wavelengths , for example , can be used to determine the radius of the onset of dust formation as well as to constrain the dominant grain size ( groenewegen @xcite ) . to gain information on details of the spatial structure ,",
    "in particular on asymmetries and inhomogeneties of the cds , the interferometric imaging with large single  dish telescopes is especially well suited because one observation provides all spatial frequencies up to the diffraction limit of the telescope and for all position angles simultaneously , allowing the reconstruction of true images of the object .",
    "we have chosen for our study because it represents a typical obscured oh / ir star with a high mass loss rate , whose location is not too far away from us .",
    "the distance to can be determined directly with the phase lag method ( cf .",

    "the luminosity is @xmath21 , which is within the typical range for an oxygen  rich agb star .",
    "the long period of @xmath22 determined from the variation of the oh maser ( herman & habing @xcite ) and the high mass loss rate suggest , that the star is in a late phase of its agb evolution .",
    "so far , chapman & wolstencroft ( @xcite ) reported the only high angular  resolution infrared observations of . from 1dimensional slit ",
    "scan speckle interferometry with the ukirt 3.8  m telescope at @xmath23 and @xmath24 they derive 1dimensional visibilities and determine gaussian fwhm diameters .",
    "radiative transfer models for the dust shell have been presented by rowan ",
    "robinson ( @xcite ) , bedijn ( @xcite ) , suh ( @xcite ) and recently by bressan et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "these models yield dust shell properties within the typical range of oh / ir stars , e.g.  a dust mass loss rate of about @xmath25 ( bedijn @xcite ; bressan et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or an optical depth at @xmath10 of about 10 ( bedijn @xcite ; suh @xcite ) .",

    "[ radtrf - modeling ] we present the results of the radiative transfer modeling starting with the discussion of a model , which yields a good fit of the observed sed at all wavelengths but does not reproduce the observed @xmath0 visibility . in search of an improved model",
    "the changes of the resulting sed and visibility under variations of the input parameters are investigated in the following sections .",
    "we finish the paper with a summary of the results and our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "the speckle data presented here were obtained with the russian 6  m telescope at the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) on june 14 and 16 , 1998 .",
    "we recorded a total number of 1200 speckle interferograms of ( 600 on june 14 and 600 on june 16 ) and 2400 speckle interferograms of the unresolved reference star hip  93260 ( 1200 on each of the two nights ) with our 256@xmath2256 pixel nicmos  3 camera through an interference filter with center wavelength 2.11@xmath26 m and a bandwidth of 0.192@xmath26 m .",
    "the exposure time per frame was 100  ms , the pixel size was 30.61  mas and the field of view @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath0 seeing was about @xmath28 .",
    "a diffraction - limited image of was reconstructed from the speckle data by the speckle masking bispectrum method ( weigelt @xcite ; lohmann et al.@xcite ; weigelt @xcite ) .",
    "the process includes the calculation of the average power spectrum and of the average bi  spectrum and the subtraction of the detector noise terms from those .",
    "the modulus of the object fourier transform was determined with the speckle interferometry method ( labeyrie @xcite ) .",
    "the fourier phase was derived from the bias  compensated average bispectrum .",
    "figures [ powerspectrum ] and [ visibility ] show the visibility function of at @xmath0 .",
    "the azimuthally averaged visibility decreases steadily to values below @xmath29 of the peak visibility at the diffraction cut  off frequency ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "thus , the circumstellar dust shell is almost totally resolved , and the contribution of the unresolved stellar component to the monochromatic flux at @xmath0 must be less than @xmath31 , suggesting a rather high optical depth at this wavelength . in order to derive diameters for the dust shell , the object visibility function was fitted with an elliptical gaussian model visibility function within a range of @xmath32 up to @xmath33 .",
    "we obtain a gaussian fit diameter of 43  mas@xmath251  mas for corresponding to 42  au@xmath250  au for an adopted distance of 0.98  kpc or @xmath34 for an adopted distance of 0.98  kpc and an adopted stellar radius of @xmath35 ( cf .",
    "[ best - fit - sed ] ) , respectively .",
    "figure [ object - intensity ] shows the reconstructed @xmath36 speckle masking image of .",
    "the resolution is 75  mas .",
    "figure [ intensitycuts ] shows the azimuthally averaged images derived from the reconstructed 2dimensional images of and the reference star hip  93260 . in the 2-dimensional image",
    "a deviation from spherical symmetry can be recognized .",
    "the intensity contours are elongated in the south  eastern direction along an axis with a position angle of @xmath37 .",
    "the radiative transfer calculations are performed with the code dusty developed by ivezi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , which is publicly available .",
    "the program solves the radiative transfer problem for a spherically symmetric dust distribution around a central source of radiation and takes full advantage of the scaling properties inherent in the formulation of the problem .",
    "the formulation of the radiative transfer problem , the model assumptions and the scaling properties are described in detail by ivezi & elitzur ( @xcite ) . therefore , we give only a brief discussion here .",
    "the problem under consideration is a spherically symmetric dust envelope with a dust free inner cavity surrounding a central source of radiation .",
    "this geometry is not restricted to the dust shell of a single star .",
    "it can as well describe a dust envelope around a group of stars ( e.g  a binary ) or even around a galactic nucleus . the radial dependence of the dust density between the inner and outer boundary can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "to arrive at a scale invariant formulation two assumptions are introduced : i ) the grains are in radiative equilibrium with the radiation field , and ii ) the location of the inner boundary @xmath38 of the dust envelope is controlled by a fixed temperature @xmath39 of the grains at @xmath38 . due to radiative equilibrium this temperature is determined by the energy flux at @xmath38 , which in turn is controlled by the energy flux from the central source via the radiative transfer through the dusty envelope . then prescribing the dust temperature at @xmath38 is equivalent to specifying the bolometric flux at the inner boundary , and the only relevant property of the input radiation is its spectral shape ( ivezi & elitzur @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , if the overall optical depth of the dust envelope at some reference wavelength is prescribed , only dimensionless , normalized distributions describing the spatial variation of the dust density and the wavelength dependence of the grain optical properties enter into the problem .",
    "this formulation of the radiative transfer problem for a dusty envelope is well suited for model fits of ir observations , because it minimizes the number of independent model parameters .",
    "the input consists of :    * the spectral shape of the central source of radiation , i.e.  the variation of the normalized monochromatic flux with wavelength , * the absorption and scattering efficiencies of the grains , * the normalized density distribution of the dust , * the radius of the outer boundary in units of the inner boundary , * the dust temperature at the inner boundary , * the overall optical depth at a reference wavelength .    for a given set of parameters ,",
    "dusty iteratively determines the radiation field and the dust temperature distribution by solving an integral equation for the energy density , which is derived from a formal integration of the radiative transfer equation . for a prescribed radial grid",
    "the numerical integrations of radial functions are transformed into multiplications with a matrix of weight factors determined purely by the geometry .",
    "then , the energy density at every point is determined by matrix inversion , which avoids iterations over the energy density itself and allows a direct solution of the pure scattering problem .",
    "typically fewer than 30 grid points are needed to achieve a relative error of flux conservation of less than 1% .",
    "the number of points used in angular integrations is 23 times the number of radial grid points , and the build  in wavelength grid has 98 points in the range from @xmath40 to 3.6 cm ( see appendix c in ivezi & elitzur @xcite ) .",
    "the distributed version of the code provides a variety of quantities of interest including the monochromatic fluxes and the spatial intensity distribution at wavelengths selected by the user , but not the corresponding visibilities . since we want to employ the visibilities obtained from our high spatial resolution measurements as constraints for the radiative transfer models , we have supplemented the code with routines for the calculation of synthetic visibility functions .",
    "an important ingredient for the radiative transfer modeling of circumstellar dust shells around evolved stars is the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . due to the variability of miras and oh / ir stars",
    ", the sed of such objects ideally has to be determined from coeval observations covering all wavelengths of interest .",
    "unfortunately , no such coeval photometric data set for the wavelength region from @xmath41 to @xmath42 is available in the literature for .",
    "thus , we have to define a ` composite ' sed , which is derived from observations made by different authors at different epochs , but at about the same photometric phase ( griffin @xcite ) .",
    "due to the stronger dependence of @xmath45 on the grain radius ( fig .",
    "[ sed - dp95-a0-qext ] ) and the resulting larger variation of the @xmath0 optical depth ( see table [ tab - dp95-a0 ] ) , the changes of the @xmath0 visibility are much more pronounced . with increasing @xmath46 the curvature of the visibility increases , and @xmath47 falls off to smaller values at @xmath48 because the stellar contribution to the monochromatic flux is reduced .",
    "up to @xmath49 the change of the curvature is mainly caused by the changing slope of the spatial intensity distribution , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ a0-effects ] . at larger grain radii the increase of the radius of the inner boundary and the corresponding reduction of the spatial frequencies , where @xmath47 approaches a constant value ( or zero ) becomes more important",
    "the best match of the observed visibility @xmath50 is obtained for the model with @xmath51 ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ sed - dp95-a0 ] ) , which is somewhat larger than @xmath52 for the best matching model with the sil  ow optical constants .",
    "the resulting dust mass loss rate is about 30  % smaller , and the radius of the inner boundary is about 12  % smaller . again",
    "the curvature of the model visibility is slightly too strong .",
    "but in contrast to the model with the sil  ow optical constants , there is now an excess of flux at smaller wavelengths @xmath53 .",
    "as discussed at the end of sect .",
    "[ a0-effects ] , we would expect a deficiency of flux if the cds of has a disk  like structure .",
    "this suggests that the optical constants from david & pgouri ( @xcite ) underestimate the extinction of the grain material at short wavelengths .",
    "however , we also do not know , whether the optical constants from ossenkopf et al .",
    "( @xcite ) represent the intrinsic optical properties of the grains , because the shape of the sed at short wavelengths is affected to an unknown degree by the geometry of the non - spherical dust distribution around .",
    "for the same reason we refrain from enforcing a match of the sed at short wavelengths by a suitable modification of the dust optical constants in this region ."
