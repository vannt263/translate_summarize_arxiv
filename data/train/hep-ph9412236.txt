    "in this appendix we make some remarks on the experimental determination of @xmath2 .",
    "first , let us note that the experimental value of @xmath2 may be obtained from _ three _ independent measurements : from the electronic and muonic branching ratios in the tau lepton decay , and from the total width of the tau lepton . to obtain @xmath2 from the electronic branching ratio we take : @xmath115 where according to formulas given in @xcite , with slightly updated parameters , we should take : @xmath116 to obtain @xmath2 from the muonic branching ratio we take : @xmath117 finally , to obtain @xmath2 from the total decay width we take : @xmath118 with @xmath119 obtained from the formulas given in @xcite with updated parameters .",
    "as may be expected , these three determinations do not give exactly the same value .",
    "therefore we take for @xmath120 a weighted average , according to the prescription : @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "secondly , one has to be careful which set of the world averaged experimental data one uses in the phenomenological analysis .",
    "the particle data group @xcite gives in fact _ two _ sets of values for the leptonic branching fractions .",
    "one set is a straightforward world average of the data : @xmath123 this set is called by pdg `` our average . ''",
    "another set , @xmath124 called `` our fit , '' is a result of a global fit to the tau lepton branching fractions , taking into account the relevant constraints . taking `` our average '' of pdg for the leptonic branching fractions we obtain : @xmath125 taking the present world average @xcite for the total decay width : @xmath126 we find : @xmath127 ( for @xmath128 the pdg also gives two values  in this case it seems however clear that one should take the value in which results of older experiments have been corrected for the change in the experimental number for @xmath129 . )",
    "taking a weighted average of three values for @xmath2 we find : @xmath130 this value has been further used in our paper to obtain constraints on @xmath92 .",
    "it has to be emphasized however , that if we use `` our fit '' of pdg for the leptonic branching fractions , we find : @xmath131 together with the value obtained from the total decay width this gives a weighted average of : @xmath103",

    "<S> this effect is usually regarded as a complication in the comparison of the theory with the experimental data . however , the effect of renormalization scheme dependence may be also used to improve our understanding of the perturbative result . by estimating the change in the predictions over a set of _ a priori _ acceptable schemes we may test reliability of the perturbative expression . </S>",
    "<S> this point of view has been recently discussed in @xcite , where a concrete method has been proposed for a systematic evaluation of the rs ambiguities in the qcd predictions in the next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method is based on the observation , that one should take into account predictions in all schemes that do not involve large cancellations in the expression for scheme independent combination of the expansion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> application of this method was illustrated in @xcite using as an example the qcd corrections to the bjorken sum rule for the polarized structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> also the problem of the rs ambiguities in the qcd corrections to the ratio @xcite-@xcite : @xmath1 has been considered in this framework @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it was found , that even small changes in the rs - among acceptable schemes - resulted in a large variation in the predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the strong rs dependence seemed to undermine the phenomenological importance of the qcd corrections to @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the qcd correction to @xmath2 comes originally in the form of a contour integral in the complex energy plane @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the commonly used perturbative formula appears as a result of approximate evaluation of the contour integral . as was pointed out in @xcite , the evaluation of the contour integral </S>",
    "<S> may be improved . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that using the improved evaluation of the contour integral one obtains smaller scale dependence in the @xmath3 scheme . </S>",
    "<S> it is then an interesting problem , how the improved accuracy of the predictions affects the estimate of the strength of the rs dependence evaluated according to the method developed in @xcite .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the qcd corrections to @xmath2 in various renormalization schemes by solving numerically the renormalization group equation for complex energies , and by computing numerically the relevant contour integral . using the method developed in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a quantitative estimate of the strength of the rs dependence in this case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the problem of an optimal choice of the renormalization scheme in the improved expression . </S>",
    "<S> we also make a fit of @xmath0 taking into account recently obtained experimental results for @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us begin with a brief summary of the ideas presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a nnlo expression for a physical quantity @xmath4 , properly normalized , depending on a single energy variable @xmath5 : @xmath6 , \\label{r}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes the running coupling constant that satisfies the nnlo renormalization group equation : @xmath8 ( the effects of the quark masses are neglected . ) </S>",
    "<S> the value of the predictions obtained for @xmath4 with the nnlo expressions ( [ r ] ) and ( [ rge ] ) depends on the choice of rs . </S>",
    "<S> presently in the phenomenological applications the modified minimal subtraction scheme ( @xmath9 ) @xcite is used . </S>",
    "<S> however , other choices of the renormalization scheme are possible , all related to the @xmath9 scheme by a finite renormalization . in the nnlo , in the class of the mass and gauge independent schemes , the freedom of choice of the scheme may be characterized by two continuous parameters . </S>",
    "<S> ( the relevant formulas describing the rs dependence of the coefficients @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 have been collected in @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of the perturbation theory guarantees , of course , that differences in the predictions obtained in various schemes are formally of higher order in the coupling constant , but numerical magnitude of these differences is significant for phenomenological analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this fact stimulated the interest in prescriptions for making a proper choice of the rs @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most attractive of these propositions seems to be the choice based on the so called principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , whatever scheme we decide to choose as an optimal one , there is a continuum of equally reasonable schemes close to the one preferred by us . </S>",
    "<S> predictions in such schemes also should be somehow taken into account in the phenomenological analysis . a natural way to do </S>",
    "<S> this is to supplement the prediction in a preferred scheme with an estimate of the variation of the predictions over the whole set of _ a priori _ acceptable schemes . </S>",
    "<S> a concrete realization of this idea was presented in @xcite , based on the existence of an rs independent combination of the expansion coefficients @xcite : @xmath13 which provides a natural rs independent characterization of the magnitude of the nnlo corrections for the considered physical quantity . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite it was proposed to calculate variation of the predictions for @xmath4 over the set of schemes for which the expansion coefficients satisfy the condition : @xmath14 where @xmath15 a motivation for the condition ( [ constraint ] ) is that it eliminates schemes in which the expressions ( [ r ] ) and ( [ rge ] ) involve unnaturally large expansion coefficients , implying large cancellations in the expression for the rs invariant @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath17 in the condition ( [ constraint ] ) controls the degree of cancellations that we want to allow in the expression for @xmath16 . as was pointed out in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath18 in ( [ constraint ] ) one has the pms scheme right at the boundary of the allowed region in the space of parameters characterizing the scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the estimate of the strength of the rs dependence obtained according to this prescription would be useful for a quantitative comparison of reliability of perturbative predictions for different physical quantities , evaluated at different energies </S>",
    "<S> . it should be also very useful in determining the regions of applicability of the perturbative expansion . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , any large variation of the predictions over a set of schemes satisfying constraint ( [ constraint ] ) with @xmath18 would be an unambiguous sign of a limited applicability of the nnlo expression .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the qcd corrections to the semileptonic decay of the tau lepton . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections , denoted further by @xmath19 , contribute to the ratio @xmath2 in the following way : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are factors arising from the electroweak corrections @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative correction to @xmath19 is known up to nnlo @xcite-@xcite in the approximation of massless _ u _ , _ d _ and _ s _ quarks , and it has in the conventional approach the form ( [ r ] ) with the characteristic energy scale @xmath24  gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the interest in the qcd corrections to @xmath2 @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite was originally stimulated by the fact , that the perturbative expression for @xmath19 appeared to be quite sensitive to the qcd parameter @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in principle a very good test of perturbative qcd predictions could be obtained @xcite , since the effects of nonzero masses of light quarks , and the nonperturbative effects , were estimated to be small despite the rather low energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , in @xcite large differences in the perturbative predictions for @xmath19 have between obtained in _ a priori _ acceptable schemes . </S>",
    "<S> ( the perturbative qcd corrections to @xmath2 in some optimal schemes were considered previously in @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> it seemed therefore that the high sensitivity of @xmath19 to the qcd parameter @xmath25 is practically eliminated by the ambiguities introduced by the strong rs dependence @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the commonly used perturbation expansion for @xmath19 involves not only the obvious approximation resulting from the truncation of the perturbation series , but also an approximation of another kind , which appears in the process of evaluation of @xmath19 from the expression for the two - point quark current correlators . indeed , in order to evaluate the qcd corrections to @xmath2 one starts from the formula @xcite : @xmath26 , \\label{imp}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 denotes the sum of the transverse parts of the @xmath28 vector and axial quark current correlators : @xmath29 +    @xmath30 @xmath31 ( if the quark mass effects are neglected , the longitudinal part of @xmath32 does not contribute . also , the electroweak contributions have been neglected . ) since the qcd predictions for the quark current correlators are not very well known for real positive @xmath33 , one uses the analyticity properties of @xmath34 to convert the expression ( [ imp ] ) into the contour integral in the complex energy plane : @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a contour running clockwise from @xmath37 to @xmath38 and avoiding the region of small @xmath39 , i.  e.  on @xmath40 we have @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> integrating by parts along the contour , one obtains : @xmath42 , \\label{rtcont}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is defined via the relation : @xmath44.\\ ] ] the importance of this expression lies in the fact , that @xmath19 has been expressed via the quantity @xmath43 , which is formally rs independent , and which is directly calculable in perturbative qcd for real negative @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 has a perturbation expansion of the form ( [ r ] ) , with the expansion coefficients in the @xmath9 scheme , with @xmath45 , given by @xcite : @xmath46 the commonly used expansion of @xmath19 in terms of @xmath47 is obtained from the expression ( [ rtcont ] ) by expanding @xmath48 under the integral in terms of @xmath49 : @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and performing the contour integral over the appearing powers of @xmath51 explicitly . in this way one obtains the nnlo expression for @xmath19 which has the form ( [ r ] ) with the expansion coefficients @xmath52 : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 @xmath54 in the @xmath9 scheme we have @xcite : @xmath55 we see that there is a significant difference between the expansion coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted however , that using the expansion of @xmath48 in terms of @xmath47 in the nnlo expression for @xmath57 , we make a rather crude approximation . for example , we effectively assume , that : @xmath58 as was pointed out in @xcite one may obtain a more accurate description of the qcd effects in the tau lepton decay by evaluating the @xmath33-dependence of the running coupling constant on the contour @xmath40 in a more precise way .    </S>",
    "<S> it is then an interesting question , whether the improved evaluation of the qcd corrections may change the rather upsetting result found in @xcite .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the predictions for @xmath19 obtained from the contour integral representation ( [ rtcont ] ) using a numerical solution of the renormalization group equation in the complex energy plane . to obtain the running coupling constant along the contour @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> we solve numerically the implicit equation : @xmath59 where @xmath60 the explicit form of @xmath61 is given for example in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the renormalization group coefficients for @xmath62 are @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . ) this equation is obtained by integrating the renormalization group equation ( [ rge ] ) with an appropriate boundary condition @xcite , and then analytically continuing to general complex @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the presence of @xmath66 and @xmath0 in this general expression results from taking explicitly into account the one - loop relation between @xmath25 parameters in different schemes @xcite , which is valid to all orders of perturbation expansion . </S>",
    "<S> all values of @xmath0 mentioned in this paper correspond to three `` active '' quark flavors . ) to obtain the prediction for @xmath19 we take under the contour integral the quantity @xmath57 in the nnlo approximation in the form ( [ r ] ) and we perform the contour integral numerically . to analyze the rs dependence of the thus obtained expression for @xmath19 we parametrize the freedom of choice of the rs by the coefficient @xmath10 in @xmath57 and the coefficient @xmath12 , and we calculate variation in the predictions when these parameters are changed in a region determined by the condition ( [ constraint ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the region of allowed values for @xmath10 and @xmath12 for @xmath67 , which is the case needed here , was described analytically in @xcite .    in our analysis a fundamental role is played by the nnlo rs invariant , which for @xmath57 has the value @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this value should be compared with @xmath69 , which is obtained for the conventional expansion of @xmath19 in terms of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath70 has similar magnitude , but the opposite sign , compared to @xmath16 indicates that the approximations used to derive the conventional expansion for @xmath19 may greatly distort the pattern of the rs dependence of the predictions .    the results of our calculations are presented in four figures . in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> we compare perturbative qcd predictions for @xmath19 as a function of @xmath71 , obtained in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and in nnlo using the conventional expansion , with the predictions obtained by evaluating numerically the contour integral . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly see that the differences between nlo and nnlo are much smaller for the predictions obtained from numerical calculation of the contour integral than for the predictions obtained with the conventional expansion in terms of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the expectation that the procedure for evaluating the @xmath19 adopted in this note gives indeed improvement over the conventional expansion .    in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> we show a contour plot for @xmath19 as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath12 , obtained for @xmath72  mev , together with the region of scheme parameters satisfying the condition ( [ constraint ] ) with @xmath18  smaller region  and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that  for purely technical reasons  the actual variable on the vertical axis is @xmath74 instead of @xmath12 . ) </S>",
    "<S> we see that the pattern of rs dependence in this case has more complicated structure than that obtained for conventional nnlo approximants  this is evident if one compares fig.2 with the corresponding figure in @xcite , representing the rs dependence of the qcd corrections to the bjorken sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find here _ three _ critical points which are relatively close to the allowed region , instead of one encountered in the conventional approximant . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinates of the critical point closest to the origin , i.e.  the saddle point at the boundary of the @xmath18 allowed region , are very close to the pms parameters for the quantity @xmath57 evaluated for real negative  @xmath33 ( `` euclidean '' pms ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( let us note that because of a nonpolynomial character of the improved expression for @xmath19 the value of the pms parameters can not be obtained from the set of algebraic equations given in @xcite , but it has to be determined from direct numerical analysis . ) </S>",
    "<S> this confirms the fundamental importance of @xmath57 for @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it also shows that approximations used to derive the conventional nnlo expression greatly distort the pattern of the rs dependence  the conventional nnlo approximant for @xmath19 would have a critical point for completely different values of the scheme parameters . to estimate the strength of the rs dependence we compare predictions for @xmath19 obtained for the scheme parameters lying in the denoted allowed region . </S>",
    "<S> because of the location of the critical points in this case the maximal and minimal values for @xmath19 are attained at the boundaries of the allowed regions corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the @xmath9 scheme with @xmath75 lies slightly outside the @xmath73 allowed region .    in fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> we show , how the pattern of the rs dependence of the improved expression for @xmath19 depends on the value of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for small values of @xmath0 we have only one critical point in the @xmath18 allowed region , and that it lies very close to the pms parameters for @xmath57 evaluated for spacelike momenta . with increasing @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the critical points close to the @xmath18 allowed region becomes more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> for some values of @xmath0 three critical points appear . for large values of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> the critical point corresponding to the `` euclidean '' pms evolves into a very flat plateau , and the secondary critical point , with negative @xmath10 , moves into the @xmath18 allowed region .    in fig.4 , which is the main result of this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we show how the optimal perturbative predictions for @xmath19 , and the estimates of the rs dependence , behave as a function of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our calculations are compared with constraints from the experimental data . as our preferred predition , indicated in fig.4 by a thick solid line , we take the values obtained in the scheme with @xmath77 , @xmath78 . these parameters describe , for small and intermediate values of @xmath0 , the approximate location of the leading critical point in the @xmath79 plane , and for larger values of @xmath0 they fall in the region of very small variation of the predictions . from fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> it is clear , that for all interesting values of @xmath0 the predictions for @xmath19 in this scheme practically coincide with the values at the relevant critical points . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed and dash - dotted lines represent the variation of the predictions over the @xmath18 and @xmath73 allowed regions , respectively . in order to make our results useful for other authors we give in table  1 the numerical values of the preferred predictions for @xmath19 , together with an estimate of the rs dependence , for several values of @xmath76 . for completeness </S>",
    "<S> we include also the nlo predictions , evaluated using the contour integral and optimized according the the pms prescription  they are well approximated by taking the scheme with @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that the variation of the predictions over the @xmath18 allowed region has a rather smooth dependence on @xmath0 , being almost constant for the considered range of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation over the @xmath73 region of parameters is reasonably close to the @xmath18 variation , except for the maximal value , which grows rapidly for larger @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared with the large differences found in @xcite for the conventional nnlo approximant for @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that using an improved evaluation of the predictions for @xmath19 we qualitatively improve stability of the predictions with respect to change of the rs , and we greatly reduce the ambiguities resulting from the freedom of choice of the renormalization scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare our results with those obtained in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of @xcite concentrates on variation of the renormalization scale @xmath81 in the @xmath82 scheme , which in our approach corresponds to variation of @xmath10 for fixed @xmath83 . in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> only a brief comment is made on the variation of predictions when @xmath12 is changed from @xmath84 to @xmath85 with fixed @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> it must be stressed , that there is no theoretical or phenomenological reason justifying _ a priori _ such a choice of the set of the scheme parameters . also , there is no immediate relation between the magnitude of variation found according to @xcite and the estimate of the rs dependence obtained according to our method . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> small rs dependence obtained by prescription of @xcite does not necessarily imply a small variation in our approach . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized , that if we agree that there is a `` democracy '' of renormalization schemes , then the set of considered schemes must be larger than that discussed in @xcite , and any reasonable constraint on the freedom of choice must be related to the rs invariant @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , a consideration of an essentially two - dimensional set of scheme parameters is unavoidable if one intends to find the optimal nnlo predictions according to the principle of minimal sensitivity , which requires for the optimal scheme the vanishing of the derivatives with respect to _ both _ scheme parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in fig.4 may be used to obtain an improved constraint on @xmath86 from the world average of the available experimental data on @xmath2 . as is well known , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental value of @xmath2 may be obtained in three independent ways : from the electronic and muonic branching ratios in the tau lepton decay , and from the total width of the tau lepton . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that particle data group gives _ two _ sets of values for the leptonic branching fractions  the number shown below corresponds to the set called `` our average . '' </S>",
    "<S> see appendix for a detailed discussion of the subtleties involved in obtaining experimental value for @xmath2 . ) </S>",
    "<S> taking a weighted average of these three determinations we find : @xmath87    this value may then be converted into experimental constraint on @xmath19 via eq.([rt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to have a phenomenologically meaningful constraint on @xmath88 , we must take into account also the effect of the light quark masses and the nonperturbative effects . according to @xcite </S>",
    "<S> these may be estimated to give roughly an overall @xmath89 correction to the value of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , after taking into account that the factor involving the ckm matrix elements is practically equal to unity , our final formula relating @xmath2 and @xmath88 takes the form : @xmath90 using ( [ rtex ] ) we obtain : @xmath91 where the first error reflects the effect of experimental uncertainties and the second one the effect of uncertainties in nonperturbative corrections .    </S>",
    "<S> fitting @xmath92 to this experimental value we obtain : @xmath93 for the @xmath73 region of parameters the variation in @xmath92 is @xmath94 .    as was explained in @xcite , a natural way to parametrize the qcd predictions in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> is via the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for comparison with results given in other papers on experimental tests of qcd , we give also the corresponding values of @xmath95 in the @xmath9 scheme , obtained with the three - loop renormalization group equation : @xmath96 for the @xmath73 region of parameters we obtain for @xmath97 the variation of @xmath98 .    </S>",
    "<S> using the formulas given in @xcite to match @xmath0 for different number of flavors we obtain the corresponding result for @xmath99 : @xmath100 for the @xmath73 region of parameters we obtain for @xmath101 the variation of @xmath102 .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that the rs dependence ambiguities in the determination of @xmath97 or @xmath101 from @xmath2 are not very big  this is the result of stabilization of the predictions when improved evaluation procedure is used . </S>",
    "<S> note however that the rs dependence ambiguities are still comparable in magnitude to the uncertainties related to the present experimental accuracy of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note that using for the leptonic branching fractions the values denoted by pdg as `` our fit '' @xcite we obtain ( see appendix ) : @xmath103 which is @xmath104 smaller than ( [ rtex ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> using this value we find in nnlo : @xmath105 with the same theoretical and experimental uncertainties as before .    to have a complete picture of theoretical uncertainties we give also the result of a fit of @xmath0 to the experimental value of @xmath2 , obtained with the improved nlo predictions optimized according to the pms prescription . using the nlo expression with @xmath80 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain : @xmath106 using then the two - loop renormalization group equation we find : @xmath107 @xmath108    summarizing , we have evaluated the perturbative qcd corrections to the semileptonic decay width of the tau lepton , using the contour integral representation and evaluating numerically the running coupling constant on the contour . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained results in a broad class of renormalization schemes . </S>",
    "<S> we discussed the problem of obtaining the optimal predictions in the improved evaluation , and we found predictions for @xmath19 in the scheme preferred by the principle of minimal sensitivity , both in nlo and in nnlo . using a specific condition to eliminate the schemes with unnaturally large expansion coefficients </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a quantitative estimate of the ambiguities in @xmath19 arising from the freedom of choice of the rs . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this estimate would be useful in combining the qcd results from the @xmath2 with other experimental constraints on qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the improved expression for @xmath19 is much more stable with respect to change of rs compared to the conventional perturbative nnlo expression . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we found that the rs dependence ambiguities in the fit of @xmath86 to the experimental data for @xmath19 are at least of the order of uncertainties arising from the present accuracy of experimental determinations of @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added _ + soon after this paper was posted on the bulletin board , two papers appeared @xcite @xcite in which determination of @xmath109 from the tau decay is discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we make two comments about these papers . </S>",
    "<S> first , the value of @xmath109 obtained in @xcite is almost identical to the value given in our paper . </S>",
    "<S> however , this value was obtained using @xmath110 , which is @xmath111 lower than the value we have used in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the main source of the theoretical uncertaintly estimated in @xcite @xcite appears to be the contribution from the yet uncalculated @xmath112 corrections . </S>",
    "<S> such an estimate necessarily involves some speculative assumptions on the magnitude of the higher order terms . </S>",
    "<S> also , the higher order contributions would be rs dependent , with the freedom of choice of the rs characterized by _ three _ arbitrary parameters in the four - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to extend the method used in our paper to the four - loop case in order to obtain a quantitative estimate of the resulting rs ambiguity .    </S>",
