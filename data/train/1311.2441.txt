    "the optical turbulence vertical profilers ( otvp ) are widely used in ground - based astronomy to estimate the stratification of the optical turbulence ( @xmath1 profiles ) from the ground up to the top of the atmosphere ( @xmath0 20  km ) or for sub - ranges of this interval @xcite . optical turbulence",
    "( ot ) degrades the quality of images obtained with ground - based telescopes by introducing perturbations on the perfect wavefronts coming from the observed objects located outside the atmosphere at infinite distance . to correct the wavefront perturbations , recover the intrinsic angular resolution of telescopes and obtain images at diffraction limit , different typologies of adaptive optics ( ao )",
    "techniques have been developed in the last decades @xcite .",
    "however , all ao techniques depend on the ot status in the whole atmosphere .",
    "the knowledge of the spatio - temporal distribution of the ot in an astronomical site is therefore fundamental for many reasons : to optimize the ao techniques efficiency ; to search for sites with favorable turbulence characteristics ; to characterize the atmosphere of the existent observatories to prove the reliability of new ao techniques such as the wide - field - of - view ao @xcite ; to forecast the ot to schedule scientific programs to be carried out and instruments to be placed at the focus of telescopes .",
    "different otvps have been developed in the last decades , each one characterized by some specific features .",
    "the generalized scidar ( hereafter gs : @xcite ) is a well known technique based on the autocorrelation of scintillation maps produced by binary stars on the pupil of a telescope .",
    "this technique permits to reconstruct the turbulence stratification from the ground up to 20 - 25  km with a variable vertical resolution that scales as @xcite :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the wavelength , @xmath4 is the height from the ground , @xmath4@xmath5 is the conjugated height under - ground ( see section [ gs ] ) and @xmath6 is the binary separation .",
    "considering the typical values of the binaries separation and @xmath4@xmath5 used for the gs , we can say that the gs vertical resolution is typically of the order of 1  km on the whole atmosphere .",
    "the gs is based on a solid and simple optical principle so that several gss have been built by different teams worldwide in the last two decades and used for site characterization on many among the major astronomical observatories in the world @xcite .",
    "the gs is , at present , one of the most reliable otvp to be used as a reference for testing new otvps on the whole 20  km .",
    "the main limitation is that it requires a telescope of at least 1  m ( preferably 1.5  m ) pupil size and the brightness of the binary stars has to be @xmath7 5 - 6 mag .",
    "this reduces the number of usable stars on sky .",
    "it is therefore not a good candidate to be used as an automatic monitor to be placed in astronomical observatories for systematic optical turbulence monitoring and/or for site searches but it is more suitable for dedicated experiments .",
    "the multi aperture scintillation monitor ( mass ) entered in the astronomic context in more recent years @xcite .",
    "it is based on a principle proposed by ochs in 1976 @xcite that implies the observation of scintillation maps produced by single stars on the telescope s pupil .",
    "the turbulence profile is reconstructed thanks to the analysis of the spatial structure of the scintillation map through a set of different spatial filters and the use of a set of weighting functions .",
    "kornilov introduced , as spatial filters , a set of four small concentric and circular apertures selected on the telescope s",
    "pupil @xcite .",
    "the main attractive features of the mass are : ( a ) a better sky coverage than the gs ( single stars are much more numerous than binary stars with magnitude @xmath7 5 - 6  mag ) and ( b ) a small pupil of the telescope ( of the order of 8 - 15  cm ) well suitable therefore to be employed as an automatic monitor . the main drawbacks are : ( a ) a lower vertical resolution that scales as @xmath8 @xmath0 0.5@xmath9h @xcite .",
    "more precisely it provides ot profiles sampled on 6 layers centered at 0.5  km , 1  km , 2 km , 4  km , 8  km and 16 km a.g.l . ;",
    "( b ) the mass is insensitive to the optical turbulence near the ground ( below @xmath0 0.5  km ) .",
    "it is therefore commonly considered as a free - atmosphere turbulence monitor .",
    "turbulence ground layer contribution has been frequently estimated by subtracting the mass estimate from the differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) ; ( c ) because of the particular weighting functions ( triangle shape ) of the mass , this method does not permit to identify precisely the height of the boundary layer and in general the height separating a layer from the contiguous one .",
    "turbulence developed inside a vertical slab [ h@xmath10,h@xmath11  km is distributed indeed in two different contiguous weighting functions .",
    "even if this is not particularly critical for the site selection it can create problems in some other contexts and applications such as the ao .",
    "mass and dimm have been widely used in the last decade to characterize the astroclimatic parameters of many astronomical sites in the world @xcite ) but it has been developed by just one scientific group .",
    "an intense use of this instrument has been done also for new generation telescopes site searches such as those aiming at the identification of the thirty meters telescope ( tmt ) @xcite and the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) @xcite sites .",
    "curiously , little has been done so far in terms of analysis of the mass reliability with other otvp .",
    "the unique study has been carried out so far by tokovinin @xcite in which mass and gs measurements taken simultaneously at mauna kea have been statistically compared on a sample of four nights .",
    "the conclusions of that paper state that a very good agreement ( better than 20@xmath12 ) of the integral of the turbulence in the free atmosphere as measured by the two instruments is observed .",
    "the authors report that a very satisfactory agreement is reached for layers at 8 and 16  km while the mass systematically overestimates the ot in the layer at 0.5  km and underestimates the ot in layers at 2 and 4  km .",
    "these errors have been ascribed to the restoration technique . in other words ,",
    "the total integral of the six layers is well reconstructed by the mass but its distribution among the six predefined layers presents some systematic biases .",
    "because measurements from a more recent and statistical rich site testing campaign done at cerro paranal ( and called par2007 ) are now available @xcite , we have performed in this paper a detailed cross - comparison of mass and gs measurements with the aim to provide a quantitative estimation of the accuracy of the turbulence stratification and an as precise as possible analysis of the reliability of the two instruments .",
    "this observed ot stratification represents , indeed , for us a reference to calibrate a mesoscale atmospherical model to be used to predict the ot stratification @xcite .",
    "it is therefore for us extremely important to quantify the absolute values of these quantities .    in section [ obs ]",

    "the scidar technique ( scintillation detection and ranging ) has been originally proposed by @xcite and @xcite to measure the vertical optical turbulence distribution ( the refractive index structure constant @xmath15 profiles ) in the troposphere .",

    "is insensitive to the turbulence near the ground . this fact represented in the past an important limitation for monitoring turbulence for astronomical applications because it is known that most of the turbulence develops in the low part of the atmosphere . to overcome",
    "this limitation @xcite and @xcite proposed a generalized version of the scidar ( called generalized scidar ) in which the detector is virtually conjugated below the ground at a distance @xmath16 permitting to extend the measurement range to the whole atmosphere ( from the ground up to @xmath0 20 - 25 km ) .",
    "the gs is based on the observation of binaries having an angular separation typically of @xmath0 3 - 10 arcsec , magnitude @xmath7 5 - 6 mag and a @xmath17@xmath18 @xmath0 1 mag .",
    "when two plane wavefronts coming from a binary and propagating through the atmosphere meet a turbulent layer located at a height @xmath4 from the ground , they produce , on the detector plan , optically placed below the ground at a few kilometers ( @xmath16 ) , two scintillation maps characterized by typical shadows appearing in couple at a distance @xmath19 . such a distance",

    "the amplitude of the lateral peaks is proportional to the auto - covariance of the scintillation map therefore to the strength of the turbulent layer . in summary",

    "the @xmath1 profiles are obtained taking into account the information provided by every turbulent layer all together . from an analytical point of view , as it is indicated by @xcite - eq.1 , to obtain the @xmath1 profiles one has first to calculate the difference of the perpendicular and parallel sections of the normalized auto - covariance ( ac ) , and then inverting this equation ( known as fredholm equation ) .",

    "we remind that , the fact that an agreement is observed from a statistical point of view , does not exclude that on individual nights , even for periods of a few hours , it is possible to have important discrepancies between the two instruments .",

    "this is due to the different turbulence estimation in the highest mass layer ( see fig.[layer6 ] ) .",
    "this kind of differences , in specific temporal intervals , might be attributed to different lines of sight of the two instruments .",
    "it is important to note , however , that , this is just a possible explanation . with",
    "that we mean that this is just an assumption and , in principle , we can not exclude that the difference is not due to a failure of an instrument .",
    "if we assume that the discrepancy is due to different lines of sight of the instruments this would imply the fact that in the high part of the atmosphere ( layer 6 ) , there are spatial inhomogeneities in the turbulence distribution on the horizontal plane enough large to produce differences in @xmath24 of the order of 30 - 50 @xmath12 .",
    "such an horizontal inhomogeneity , also in the high part of the atmosphere , would confirm results obtained with a gs by @xcite .",

    "one should expect an overestimation of the @xmath29 from the mass because the mass underestimate the seeing in the free atmosphere .",
    "why is this not observed ?",
    "a probable explanation is the following .",
    "@xmath31 is given by the addition of two contributions : the first one comes from the mass ( @xmath33 ) ; the second one comes substantially from the dimm ( @xmath41 ) ( @xmath42 is indeed much weaker than @xmath43 ) . looking at fig .",
    "[ tau0_te ] , we note that , in the second part of the campaign ( starting from 19/12 ) , where the absolute value of @xmath29 is large , the mass @xmath29 shows some tendency in giving a larger @xmath29 value with respect to the gs .",
    "we verified ( fig .",
    "[ tau0_gl_vs_fa ] ) that the nights characterized by a small @xmath29 ( @xmath29 @xmath44 5 msec ) correspond to the cases in which the @xmath41 contribution is dominant with respect to the @xmath33 . the term dominant means smaller because the @xmath29 respects eq.[eq : tau_mass ] . in the nights characterized by a large @xmath29 ( @xmath29 @xmath39 5 msec ) we can have both cases even if it is more frequent that the @xmath33 contribution is dominant .",
    "this indicates that the turbulence and/or the wind speed ( or even both of them ) in the boundary layer are so weak that the @xmath29 contribution from the free atmosphere becomes dominant . in those cases",
    "the overestimation of the mass starts to be evident but on the whole sample of nights the dimm contribution is dominant with respect to the mass one .",
    "considering that the typical @xmath29 median value of a good site is of the order of 4 - 5 msec , i.e. close to the threshold that we indicated , we think that it would be very useful , for precautionary principle , to do in the future the same comparison of mass vs. gs @xmath29 on a richer statistical sample to confirm the conclusion of a good correlation and to confirm the fact that the overestimation tendency of the mass remains statistically not so important .",
    "we observe that , even if our results as well as those obtained by @xcite ( hereafter t05 ) show some discrepancies between the mass and the gs measurements , the two studies reached in some cases similar results , in other cases different results .",

    "are smaller ( see col.7 of table [ tab : stat ] ) but we calculated also the relative errors in j because t05 used j. a premise is necessary : due to the fact that the statistical samples of the two studies are relatively small and in any case not equal ( 12 - 14 nights for our study and 4 nights for the t05 study ) we can not expect necessarily equivalence in the absolute value of the relative errors .",

    "we think , however , that it would be useful to repeat the calculation on a richer statistical sample to confirm these results .",
    "they indicate , indeed , biases on the mass estimations when it is used as a monitor of the optical turbulence in the free - atmosphere .",
    "it is therefore important to fix this point to use correctly this instrument in this context .",
    "the other differences found in the two studies are more difficult to be justified .",
    "we think however that the most worried thing is the fact that visibly important discrepancies between the layers are detected in both studies . a richer statistical sample would certainly help in better understanding the status of art .",
    "we are promoting , in the context of an international working group @xcite , a site testing campaign aiming at establish absolute calibration of different vertical profilers among those , the mass and the gs .",
    "it is evident that such not negligible discrepancies in individual layers can not be considered satisfactory for some applications such as the one in which we are interested on , for example the identification of a reference for a model validation .",
    "discrepancies on individual layers are also very critical in application to the optimization of all kind of ao systems that are particularly sensitive to the position and strength of the individual turbulent layers .",
    "for the same reasons the mass appears not very suitable for the calibration of the atmospherical models for the ot forecast .",
    "we report here few words on the consequences of our results on previous studies done in the context of the site search / selection .",
    "we note that , in spite of evident ot discrepancies on individual layers , @xmath24 appears well correlated between the mass and the gs .",
    "there are therefore no major implications that might contradict results obtained previously .",
    "the free atmosphere seeing was probably underestimated ( and the boundary layer overestimated because it is calculated by subtraction of the mass contribution from the dimm one ) but we note that this happened for all the sites and , due to the fact that the site selection is an exercise done in relative terms , the consequences are therefore not so critical . for the @xmath29 we remind that , at the epoch of the tmt and e - elt site selection the atmos 2.97.3 software that we used was not available .",
    "the two teams used different approaches to calculate @xmath29 . in the tmt case",
    "@xcite the mass software was corrected by a constant factor ( 1.73 ) found fitting measurements with wind speed radiosoundings and the order of magnitude of the final @xmath29 was included between 4.2 and 5.6 msec . in the e - elt case @xcite @xmath29 was calculated using the @xmath1 from mass and dimm plus the wind speed from the global data assimilation system ( gdas ) database , with a 1@xmath45 horizontal resolution of the air resources laboratory ( arl ) of the national oceanic and atmospheric .",
    "it is known , however , that these data coming form the general circulation models have a too low resolution to well represent the wind speed in the low part of the atmosphere , particularly on mountain regions @xcite . limiting our commentaries to the potential consequences of the results of this paper on previous @xmath29 estimations",
    "we can simply say that , apart the fact that in both cases they used the @xmath1 in the free atmosphere from the mass that was , highly probably , underestimated , it would be a hazard to deduce any other consequences from our results .",
    "we limit ourselves to observe that the order of magnitude of the @xmath29 median values found in those studies fit with the expected order of magnitude .",
    "in this study we present the results of a detailed comparison of the turbulence stratification in the free atmosphere as well as of the astroclimatic parameters ( seeing , isoplanatic angle and wavefront coherence time ) as measured by the mass and the gs .",
    "the main results that we obtained tell us that :    * the mass underestimates the integrated turbulence ( j or seeing ) in the free atmosphere with respect to the gs with a relative error of -32@xmath12 in seeing terms ( -48@xmath12 in j terms ) ; a bias = -0.21  arcsec and a rmse = 0.25  arcsec if we consider the 6 layers of the mass .",
    "if we consider the highest 5 layers ( from layer 2 to layer 6 ) the relative error decreases to -20@xmath12 in seeing terms ( -30@xmath12 in j terms ) ; the bias = -0.1 arcsec and the rmse = 0.16  arcsec .",
    "we find important discrepancies between mass and gs in all the individual layers ( reaching relative errors as high as -65@xmath12 in seeing terms and -82@xmath12 in j terms ) with exception of the layers located at 2 and 16  km ( layers 3 and 6 ) in which the relative error remains limited to + 18@xmath12 in seeing terms ( + 20@xmath12 in j terms ) ; * the unique study previously published on a similar topic ( even if it was applied on a poorer statistical sample , @xcite ) revealed relative errors on individual layers as large as those we observed in our study ; * the main difference between our results and those of @xcite is that they found a substantial good agreement of the free - atmosphere seeing as measured by the mass and the gs on a statistical sample of 4 nights while we find that the mass underestimates the free - atmosphere seeing with respect to the gs on a statistical sample of 12 nights .",
    "the relative error is -32@xmath12 in seeing terms ( -48@xmath12 in j terms ) .",
    "even if our estimations are statistically more reliable , it should be useful to confirm our results on a richer statistical sample .",
    "this result , if confirmed , should have important consequences on the main use of the mass done so far i.e. as a monitor of the free - atmosphere seeing ; * the isoplanatic angle ( @xmath24 ) appears substantially well correlated between the two instruments ( bias = -0.07  arcsec ; rmse = 0.53  arcsec and relative error r = 3@xmath12 ) because the most important contribution to @xmath24 comes from the ot in the highest layer ( layer 6 ) that is well correlated between the two instruments ; * the wavefront coherence time ( @xmath29 ) is well correlated between the two instruments ( bias = 0.20  msec ; rmse = 1.52  msec and relative error r = 1@xmath12 ) .",
    "the underestimation of the mass in quantifying the free atmosphere turbulence seems to have a minor effect on the @xmath29 because the boundary layer contribution from the dimm ( @xmath41 ) has , in many cases , a dominant role with respect to the contribution from the mass ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "it should be useful to repeat the same calculation on a richer statistical sample to confirm this thesis .",
    "we observed that , the cases in which biases induced by the overestimation of the free atmosphere turbulence from the mass can be more evident , is when @xmath29 is large ( @xmath39 5 msec ) ; * we proved that , contrary to what is frequently believed , the boundary layer contribution of the @xmath29 has , most of the time , a more important impact from a quantitative point of view than the free atmosphere one . ; * even if the good correlation of some astroclimatic parameters has been observed in statistical terms ( @xmath24 and @xmath29 ) this does not exclude that , on individual nights , on intervals of a few hours , important discrepancies are observed between the two instruments .",
    "we therefore warn in using appropriately the conclusions of this study depending on the contexts ; * we proved that conclusions reached in this study definitely would require a richer statistical sample of measurements to be confirmed .",
    "an international action is on - going @xcite to promote a site testing campaign including classical and new - generation vertical profilers aiming at quantifying the absolute values of the optical turbulence and the intrinsic uncertainty we have to consider for each astroclimatic parameter and at validating the new - generation instruments .",
    "the intention is to collect measurements on rich statistical samples ( order of two weeks in summer and two weeks in winter ) .",
    "the mass is supposed to be one of these instruments i.e. we will be able to verify these results on a richer statistical sample .",
    "besides , such great relative errors on individual layers as well as on the free atmosphere suggests ancillary studies based on dedicated simulations to identify the origin of the mass discrepancies ; * our results indicate that the mass is not necessarily a suitable tool for some applications such as the calibration of atmospherical model for the ot forecasts and all applications in which it is crucial to know the location and the ot strength of individual layers such as the ao ; * concerning the impact that these results can have on site selection studies previously done ( tmt and e - elt ) we showed that in some cases there were no consequence at all . in other cases we suspect some biases but , due to the fact that the site selection is a relative terms exercise and therefore the biases should be applied to all sites , we think that these results should have no major consequences on the most important goal of these activities i.e. the selection of the site for the respective telescopes .",
    "this study is co - funded by the eso contract : e - sow - eso-245 - 0933 ( mose project ) .",
    "we are very grateful to the eso board of mose ( marc sarazin , pierre - yves madec , florian kerber and harald kuntschner ) for their constant support to this study .",
    "this study takes advantage of measurements performed during the par2007 site testing campaign promoted by eso in the context of the e - elt design study ( fp6 program ) .",
    "different international teams from laboratoire lagrange - universit de nice - sophia antipolis ( france ) , iac ( spain ) , eso ( germany ) , sternberg astronomical institute ( russia ) participated and/or have been involved in the par2007 campaign .",
