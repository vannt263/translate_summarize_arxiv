    "recently , ortolani , bica & barbuy ( 1997 , hereafter obb97 ) studied v vs v - i diagrams of the inner bulge globular cluster hp1 , which revealed the presence of a double red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "one rgb is more populated and steep , and is accompanied by a well - developed blue horizontal branch ( hb ) , which undoubtedly characterizes hp1 as a metal - poor globular cluster .",
    "the other rgb , observed in a r@xmath2 extraction , is curved and extended , characteristic of a nearly - solar metallicity stellar population , like that of the globular cluster ngc6553 or the baade window itself ( ortolani et al .",
    "obb97 favored the interpretation of a bulge contamination over that of a merger of two clusters , to explain the secondary rgb in hp1 . in the present _ letter",
    "_ we explore a scenario where this contamination may correspond to physical captures of bulge stars .    van den bergh ( 1996 ) proposed the merger scenario to explain composite ( blue and red ) horizontal branches for some intermediate and low metallicity globular clusters in the milky way . for such mergers to occur",
    ", individual clusters must have low relative velocities .",
    "this condition is matched in dwarf galaxies , where the clusters could have merged in a first step inside the dwarf , and subsequently would have been accreted by our galaxy . as pointed out by van den bergh ( 1996 ) the exceptionally bright globular cluster m54 in the sagittarius dwarf",
    "( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) might be such an example",
    ".    the merger scenario would not be appropriate for the particular case of hp1 since ( i ) the bulge velocity dispersion is very high , which makes unprobable mergers of globular clusters within the bulge , and ( ii ) the stellar population of the secondary rgb in hp1 is exceedingly metal rich to have been originated in a dwarf galaxy .    in the present",
    "_ letter _ we study , both analytically and with n - body simulations , the possibility of capture of bulge stars by a globular cluster , as an alternative mechanism to explain the secondary rgb observed in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of hp1 .",
    "we study the capture scenario by a globular cluster orbiting inside the bulge , assuming for the bulge total mass and mass distribution those predicted in the galaxy model by hernquist(1993 ; see also , hernquist 1990a ) .",
    "obb97 derived for hp1 a distance of @xmath31.3kpc from the galactic center . for this distance",
    "the cluster faces a star density of 0.33m@xmath4/pc@xmath5 ( hernquist 1993 ) . for the remaining cluster parameters we consider a grid of values which encompasses probable properties for a bulge globular cluster .",
    "the rotation of the galactic bulge ( menzies 1990 ) implies that globular clusters in the bulge might present considerable amounts of streaming motion .",
    "so we consider three possible values for the cluster velocity ( v@xmath6 ) : 50 , 100 and 160kms@xmath7 . for cluster diameters we test 10 , 15 and 20pc , whereas for masses the values are 10@xmath8 , 10@xmath9 and 10@xmath10m@xmath4 . for these ranges of sizes and velocities",
    "the cluster encounters a total number of bulge stars in the range @xmath11n@xmath12 during 1 myr ( assuming 1m@xmath4 for bulge stars ) .",
    "similarly , the size and mass ranges imply cluster escape velocities 3kms@xmath13v@xmath14kms@xmath7 .",
    "the cluster mass is the most important parameter determining the escape velocity @xmath15 , for the adopted grid .",
    "the bulge velocity distribution is assumed to be isothermal ( binney&tremaine 1987 ) with a dispersion of 113kms@xmath7 ( e.g. sharples et al .",
    "the number of bulge stars capable to be captured by the cluster must satisfy the following velocity constraints : @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the angle between the star velocity ( @xmath19 ) and that of the cluster ( @xmath20 ) . adopting a typical mass of 1m@xmath4 for bulge stars ,",
    "the number of stars n@xmath21 which are captured over 1gyr by the cluster can be summarized as follows : ( i ) for a 10@xmath10m@xmath4 cluster with escape velocity v@xmath22kms@xmath7 and streaming velocity v@xmath23kms@xmath7 , n@xmath24 , whereas for v@xmath25kms@xmath7 , n@xmath26 .",
    "( ii ) for a 10@xmath9m@xmath4 cluster with escape velocity v@xmath27kms@xmath7 and streaming velocity v@xmath23kms@xmath7 , n@xmath28 , whereas for v@xmath29kms@xmath7 the captures become negligible . finally , a 10@xmath8m@xmath4 cluster does not capture a significant number of stars .",
    "this would set constraints on the mass of a cluster with a secondary rgb , like hp1 .",
    "in order to further check the capture scenario , we performed a n - body numerical experiment .",
    "we used a hierarchical tree algorithm ( barnes & hut 1986 ) in the cesup - ufrgs cray y - mp2e computer .",
    "the algorithm was optimized for vector architectures ( hernquist 1987,1990b ) .",
    "the adopted tolerance parameter is 0.7 , and the calculation includes quadrupole terms .",
    "the globular cluster was modeled with a plummer polytrope with 10@xmath8 particles amounting a mass of 10@xmath9m@xmath4 .",
    "the plummer cluster cutoff diameter is 15pc and the core diameter is 2pc . the cluster was left to evolve isolated during 1 relaxation time ( 2.8myr ) to check its stability . due to computational limitations on the number of particles in the simulation , we adopted for cluster and field stars 10m@xmath4 particles .",
    "more details on similar star cluster simulations are given in rodrigues _",
    "et  al._(1994 ) .",
    "the adopted galactic bulge density at the cluster location is that of the previous section .",
    "a cluster with a streaming velocity of 50kms@xmath7 encounters a mass of bulge stars of 2948m@xmath4myr@xmath7 .",
    "the bulge stars encountered by the cluster during 10myr were placed in a homogeneous sphere with size equal to that of the cluster , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : simul]a , b .",
    "the speed @xmath30 of a given star in the bulge sphere was randomly sampled from a gaussian distribution with @xmath31kms@xmath7 ( sect .",
    "[ anal ] ) .",
    "the cartesian velocity components were calculated from @xmath30 assuming isotropy .",
    "the simulation begins with spatially coincident cluster and bulge spheres , placed to orbit around a massive particle of @xmath32m@xmath33 , representing the bulge mass internal to the cluster position ( sect .",
    "[ anal ] ) .",
    "the status of the simulation after 10myr is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : simul]c , d , respectively for the cluster and nine bulge particles ( equivalent to 90m@xmath4 ) which were captured . in",
    "order to further check the capture stability we left the simulation evolve up to 50myr ( figs .",
    "[ fig : simul]c , d ) and seven particles ( 70m@xmath4 ) remained trapped .",
    "we remind that during these supplementary 40myr no new encounters with bulge stars were considered .",
    "the capture rate obtained from this numerical simulation implies that about 7000 to 9000m@xmath4 can be captured by a 10@xmath9m@xmath4 globular cluster lurking in the bulge during 1gyr , in good agreement with the analytical results of sect .",
    "in the present _ letter _ we proposed a capture mechanism to explain a metal - rich secondary rgb in the cmd of the bulge metal - poor globular cluster hp1 .",
    "so far the proposed mechanisms affecting the number of stars in globular clusters are the escape of stars by evaporation ( e.g. spitzer & thuan 1972 ) and ejection ( e.g hnon 1969 ) . by far evaporation",
    "is the most important escape mechanism : typically , a globular cluster with 10@xmath10m@xmath4 should be stable during a hubble time , whereas one with 10@xmath9m@xmath4 should lose an important fraction of its mass . the disk shocking process ( ostriker _ et  al._1972",
    "; see also binney & tremaine 1987 ) , not only by the disk but also by the bulge itself in such central regions , is another possible loss mechanism . the presently proposed accretion mechanism for bulge globular clusters would balance such losses , allowing those with @xmath34m@xmath4 to survive in the bulge .",
    "depending on the cluster mass , as well as on the evaporation and capture rates it is possible to envisage changes of the cluster stellar population content over a hubble time .",
    "a very massive cluster , initially metal - poor , would conserve this character and add a secondary metal - rich component to its cmd , as could be the case of hp1 . on the other hand",
    ", a less massive initially metal - poor cluster might recycle its stellar content , if capture dominates over evaporation effects , so that its cmd would become similar to that of the bulge . in this case",
    "the metal - poor evolutionary sequences like blue hb and vertical rgb would become relatively less populated .",
    "hubble space telescope color - magnitude diagrams of metal - rich bulge clusters would be important to check this scenario .",
    "the metallicity distribution of the galactic globular clusters is skewed towards high metallicities , or it is perhaps bimodal ( zinn 1980 ) , and can not be described by a one - zone metal enrichment model ( bica & pastoriza 1983 ) .",
    "the above described scenario of bulge star captures by globular clusters and recycling of their stellar population provides a natural way to create an asymmetrical histogram of cluster metallicities from an initially gaussian distribution .",
    "it is possible to speculate the existence of two families of metallic clusters : ( i ) genuine ones formed from enriched gas , and ( ii ) recycled ones which were initially metal - poor and , over a hubble time , developed cmd sequences like those of the baade window by means of captures .",
    "the relative loci of evolutionary sequences in the hr diagram for globular clusters of different metallicities is fundamental for the calibration of stellar population parameters .",
    "da costa & armandroff ( 1990 ) studied metal - poor globular clusters together with 47tucanae , whereas bica , barbuy & ortolani ( 1991 ) studied those of nearly solar metallicity .",
    "the hp1 cmd containing combined metal - poor and metal - rich stellar populations could provide a means to directly measure relative blanketings , independently of stellar atmosphere and spectral models .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] the cmd of the spatial extraction for r@xmath3523  from obb97 , where in addition to the mean locus of a metal - poor globular cluster ( ngc6752 with [ z / z@xmath4]=-1.54 ) fitted to the sequences of hp1 itself , we also superimpose that of the nearly - solar metallicity globular cluster ngc6553 ( ortolani et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this hp1 cmd was built from images obtained at the eso ntt 3.55 m telescope and was reduced with the daophot ii package with particular care for crowded field extractions and calibrations ( ortolani _ et  al._1996 , obb97 ) .",
    "we illustrate relative measures of reference points in the cmd .",
    "the magnitude difference between the metal - poor and metal - rich horizontal branches is @xmath37mag , which has important implications for the relative distances of globular clusters ( e.g. jones _",
    "et  al._1992 ) .",
    "the magnitude difference between the brightest giants in the metal - poor and metal - rich rgbs is @xmath38mag .",
    "however , if the tips of the metal - poor and metal - rich giant branches correspond to a similar stellar temperature , the difference could be as large as @xmath39mag , due to blanketing effects .",
    "finally , the color difference could be as large as @xmath40mag .",
    "such magnitude and color differences are fundamental quantities for blanketing calibrations of metal - rich stellar populations .",
