    "in many biological disciplines , computational modeling of interaction networks is the key for understanding biological phenomena . such networks are traditionally studied using deterministic models .",
    "however , it has been recently recognized that when the populations are small in size , the inherent random effects become significant and to incorporate them , a stochastic modeling paradigm is necessary .",
    "hence , stochastic models of reaction networks have been broadly adopted and extensively used .",
    "such models , for instance , form a cornerstone for studying heterogeneity in clonal cell populations .    in biological applications ,",
    "one is often interested in knowing the long - term behavior and stability properties of reaction networks even with incomplete knowledge of the model parameters .",
    "however for stochastic models , no analytical tools are known for this purpose , forcing many researchers to use a simulation - based approach , which is highly unsatisfactory . to address this issue",
    ", we develop a theoretical and computational framework for determining the long - term behavior and stability properties for stochastic reaction networks .",
    "our approach is based on a mixture of ideas from probability theory , linear algebra and optimization theory .",
    "we illustrate the broad applicability of our results by considering examples from various biological areas",
    ". the biological implications of our results are discussed as well .",
    "reaction networks are used as modeling tools in many areas of science .",
    "examples include chemical reaction networks @xcite , cell signalling networks @xcite , gene expression networks @xcite , metabolic networks @xcite , pharmacological networks @xcite , epidemiological networks @xcite and ecological networks @xcite .",
    "traditionally , reaction networks are mathematically analyzed by representing the dynamics as a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "such a deterministic model is reasonably accurate when the number of network participants is _",
    "large_. however , when this is not the case , the discreteness in the interactions becomes important and the dynamics inherently _",
    "noisy_. this _ random _ component of the dynamics can not be ignored as it can strongly influence the system s behavior @xcite . to understand the effects of this randomness ,",
    "stochastic models are needed , and the most common approach is to model the reaction dynamics as a continuous - time markov process . the most common approach is to model the dynamics as a continuous - time markov process whose states denote the current population size .",
    "many recent works have employed such stochastic models to study the impact of noise @xcite .    in stochastic models ,",
    "the underlying markov process @xmath0 is a _ pure - jump _ process whose state space @xmath1 contains all the population size vectors that are _ reachable _ by the random dynamics .",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath0 evolves according to a system of linear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , known as the _ chemical master equation _ ( cme ) or forward kolmogorov equation @xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 is infinite or very large in size , the most common approach for approximating the solutions of a cme is by simulating a large number of trajectories of the underlying markov process @xmath0 , and using the sample values of @xmath2 to estimate the distribution at time @xmath3 .",
    "such simulations are performed using monte carlo procedures such as gillespie s _ stochastic simulation algorithm _ ( ssa ) or its variants @xcite .",
    "since the simulation time of ssa depends linearly on the number of reactions that occur during the simulation time period , these procedures can be cumbersome for large networks .",
    "it is well - known that the stochastic effects caused by the random timing of reactions become less important when the population size is large .",
    "the dynamical law of large numbers proved by kurtz @xcite shows that under an appropriate scaling relationship between the population size , reaction rates and the system size , the stochastic model of a reaction network converges to the deterministic model , as the system size goes to infinity . under this scaling relationship",
    ", one can also approximate the stochastic dynamics with certain stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) that are easier to simulate and analyze @xcite .",
    "however , these sde approximations can only work when the population sizes of all the species in the reaction network are large , which is often not the case . for a detailed survey on the topic of estimating the solution of a cme",
    ", we refer the readers to the paper @xcite which contains an exhaustive list of methods for this purpose .    in many biological applications , one in interested in analyzing the long - term behavior or stability properties of a reaction network .",
    "this is fairly straightforward for deterministic models because many tools from the theory of ordinary differential equations can be used for this analysis @xcite .",
    "however , the stability properties of stochastic models for reaction networks are difficult to verify for the following reasons",
    ". let us consider a stochastic reaction network whose dynamics is represented by the markov process @xmath0 with state space @xmath1 .",
    "the evolution of the distributions of this markov process is given by @xmath4 which is the solution of the cme corresponding to the reaction network .",
    "heuristically , we regard the stochastic dynamics to be stable when the family of distributions @xmath4 is  well - behaved \" with time . in this paper , we consider several notions of  well - behaved \" dynamics .",
    "the strongest of these notions is the concept of _ ergodicity _ @xcite which means that there exists a unique stationary distribution @xmath5 for the markovian dynamics , such that @xmath6 as @xmath7 , irrespective of the initial distribution @xmath8 .",
    "this is analogous to having a globally attracting fixed point in the deterministic setting . if @xmath1 is finite , the process is ergodic if and only if it is _ irreducible _ , in the sense that all the states in @xmath1 are reachable from each other .",
    "it is hence enough to check irreducibility of the process using e.g. matrix methods @xcite .",
    "contrary to this situation , our main interest in this paper is in analyzing the stability properties of stochastic reaction networks with an infinite state space @xmath1 .",
    "note that in such cases , irreducibility no longer implies ergodicity , since the trajectories of the markov process may blow up with time ( see the carcinogenesis example in the discussion section ) . in this",
    "regard , ergodicity can not be considered as _ a generic property _ of reaction networks with infinite state - spaces since both ergodic and non - ergodic processes can be found in nature . assuming ergodicity without verifying it beforehand seems to be therefore unreasonable from both theoretical and practical perspectives .",
    "the direct verification of stability properties like ergodicity is generally not possible as the cme can not be explicitly solved , except in some restrictive cases @xcite . the common approach of using monte carlo simulations for estimating the solutions of a cme is inadequate for assessing the long - term behavior and stability properties of a stochastic reaction network , because one can only simulate finitely many trajectories and those too for a finite amount of time .",
    "some methods for analyzing stability properties without the need for simulations exist , but they either work for specific networks @xcite , , or assume system size approximations where the stochastic dynamics is represented by an sde @xcite .",
    "such system size approximations do not hold when some species are present in low copy numbers , and even if they hold , the approximation error generally blows up with time @xcite . hence the stochastic dynamics and",
    "the corresponding sde may have completely different long - term behaviors .",
    "our aim , in this paper , is to develop a theoretical and computational framework for analyzing the long - term behavior and stability properties of stochastic models for reaction networks that do not rely on computationally expensive monte carlo simulations or on system size approximations of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "the approach proposed in @xcite is built upon a foster - lyapunov criterion @xcite and a quadratic foster - lyapunov function in order to estimate the location of the stationary distribution . in the same , yet different , spirit , the proposed approach also relies on a foster - lyapunov condition but using a linear foster - lyapunov function that allows us to establish ergodicity , moment bounds , moment convergence and the existence of attractive sets for moments .",
    "while the approach in @xcite is fully computational , the one we propose is also theoretical and allows us to conclude on structural properties of classes of networks such as _ structural ergodicity _",
    ", _ structural boundedness of moments _ and _ structural convergence of moments_. our approach relies on a mixture of simple ideas from stochastic analysis , linear algebra , polynomial analysis and optimization .",
    "we mentioned before that the stochastic and the deterministic models of a reaction network are connected through the dynamical law of large numbers @xcite .",
    "it might be tempting to think that the stability properties of a stochastic model can be assessed by studying the stability properties of the corresponding deterministic model .",
    "however in general , the stochastic and deterministic models can have very different stability properties .",
    "this is because a deterministic model can not capture noise induced effects which may have a significant impact on the long - term behavior of a system .",
    "for example , in the synthetic toggle switch by gardener @xcite , the deterministic model exhibits bistability and hence starting from different initial values , the system can converge to two different steady states . on the other hand",
    ", the corresponding stochastic model is ergodic ( see network ) and hence the solution of the cme converges to the same stationary distribution irrespective of the initial distribution .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs with the repressilator ( see @xcite and network ) , where the stochastic model is ergodic while the deterministic model exhibits oscillations . on the other hand , it is also possible to find networks for which the deterministic model has a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point , implying that whenever the initial condition is contained within its region of attraction , the trajectories converge to it .",
    "if the initial condition lies outside this region of attraction , then the trajectories of such a network become unbounded with time . in the stochastic",
    "setting , the randomness causes each trajectory to leave the region of attraction in finite time , and then become unbounded suggesting that there is no stationary distribution for the dynamics ( see network and figure [ fig : local ] ) .",
    "our results can help in understanding the stability properties of the moments of a markov process @xmath0 representing a reaction network .",
    "in particular , we present a method to check if these moments remain bounded with time and if they converge to their steady state values as time goes to infinity .",
    "such results can help in verifying the suitability of a model for a given system and in designing biological controllers that drive the moments to specific steady state values .",
    "we provide easily computable bounds for the moments that hold uniformly in time .",
    "we also determine bounds for the steady state moment values , which can help in understanding the properties of the steady state distribution , even if this distribution is not explicitly computable . in many biological applications ,",
    "it is of great interest to explicitly compute the first few moments of the process @xmath0 without solving the corresponding cme .",
    "one can easily express the dynamics of these moments as a system of ordinary differential equations , but generally this system is not closed when the network has nonlinear interactions .",
    "many moment closure methods that suggest schemes to close these equations to obtain approximations for the moments have been proposed ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can be used to ascertain the correctness of a given moment closure method for a specific network ( see the example based on the network ) .",
    "furthermore , several moment closure methods are developed under an implicit assumption that the _ moment - generating _ function corresponding to the solution of the cme exists for all times .",
    "one of our results provides a way to easily check that this assumption is indeed valid .",
    "+ * reaction networks .",
    "* let us now formally describe reaction networks .",
    "motivated by the literature on chemical kinetics , we refer to the network participants as _ molecules _ which may belong to one of @xmath9 species @xmath10 .",

    "the concentration of a species is simply its molecular count divided by the system volume .",
    "if the initial state is @xmath16 , then the evolution of concentrations is given by @xmath17 which satisfies the reaction rate equations ( rre ) of the form @xmath18 we are interested in the long - term behavior and stability of our reaction dynamics .",
    "more precisely , we would like to check if the following conditions are satisfied .",

    "the first condition , * dc1 * , says that for any @xmath16 , the entire trajectory @xmath17 stays within some compact set .",
    "we would expect this to be true for most _ realistic _ systems .",
    "hence a violation of this property may suggest a _",
    "flaw _ in the deterministic model .",

    "set for the dynamics , where all the trajectories eventually lie , irrespective of their starting point .",
    "the last condition , * dc3 * , says that there is a globally attracting fixed point for the deterministic model .",
    "using techniques from the theory of dynamical systems @xcite , one can verify these conditions , without the need of simulating the deterministic model .",
    "there is also a general theory to check condition * dc3 * for reaction networks satisfying mass - action kinetics ( see @xcite ) . broadly speaking , these three conditions present different ways of saying that the reaction dynamics is  well - behaved \" .",
    "our goal in this paper is to develop a theoretical and computational framework for verifying conditions similar to @xmath26 and @xmath27 for stochastic models of reaction networks",
    ".    * stochastic models . *",
    "consider the stochastic model corresponding to the reaction network described above . in this setting , the firing of reactions are discrete events and the state of the system refers to the vector of molecular counts of the @xmath9 species .",
    "when the state is @xmath28 , the @xmath14-th reaction fires after a random time which is exponentially distributed with rate @xmath29 .",
    "the functions @xmath30 are known as the _ propensity _ functions in the literature .",
    "the dynamics can be represented by the markov process @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the initial state .",
    "note that if @xmath33 , then @xmath34 is the _ number _ of molecules of @xmath35 at time @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to select a suitable state space @xmath1 for the markov process representing the reaction dynamics .",

    "the role of this assumption will become clear in the next section , when we discuss the issue of state space _",
    "irreducibility_. note that in certain cases , such as the _ pure - birth _",
    "network @xmath44 , a suitable state space satisfying the above criteria can not be found .",
    "there also exist cases where the above criteria restricts the choice of state space .",
    "for example , for the _ pure - death _",
    "network @xmath45 , the only possible choice for state space is @xmath46 .",
    "finally we remark that if the reactions in a network satisfy a conservation relation then the state space must be chosen with an initial condition in mind .",
    "for example , for the network @xmath47 , the sum of molecular counts of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is preserved by the reactions .",
    "hence if we wish to study the stochastic dynamics with the initial sum as @xmath50 , then the correct choice for state space is @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the space of probability distributions over @xmath1 , endowed with the weak topology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for any @xmath53 let @xmath54 denote the following probability @xmath55 defining @xmath56 , for any @xmath57 , we can view @xmath58 as an element in @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , @xmath58 is the distribution at time @xmath3 of the markov process @xmath60 .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath58 is given by the chemical master equation ( cme ) which has the following form : @xmath61 where @xmath62 if @xmath63 and @xmath64 for all @xmath65 .",
    "theoretically , one can find @xmath66 for any @xmath21 and @xmath67 , by solving this system .",
    "however this system consists of as many equations as the number of elements in @xmath1 .",
    "hence an explicit solution is only possible when @xmath1 is finite , which only happens in very restrictive cases where all the reactions preserve some conservation relation .",
    "typically , @xmath1 is infinite and solving this system analytically or even numerically is nearly impossible , except in some restrictive cases ( see @xcite ) . from now on",
    ", we assume that @xmath1 is infinite .",
    "the above discussion shows that at the level of distributions , we can view the stochastic dynamics @xmath68 as the deterministic dynamics @xmath69 , which satisfies the cme .",
    "however , the major difficulty in analyzing this deterministic dynamics is that it occurs over an infinite dimensional space @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless we can recast the conditions * dc1 * , * dc2 * and * dc3 * in the stochastic setting as below .    * sc1 * : :    for any @xmath32 , there is a compact set    @xmath70 such    that @xmath71 for all    @xmath21 .",

    "this suggests that in the long run , the family of processes @xmath81 , spend most of their time on the same set of states .",
    "the last condition * sc3 * says that the evolution of distributions have a globally attracting fixed point @xmath5 .",
    "if this holds , then the markov process representing the reaction dynamics is _ ergodic _ with @xmath5 as the unique stationary distribution . for understanding the long - term behavior of a stochastic process",
    ", ergodicity is a desirable property to have . in the long - run , the proportion of time spent by any trajectory of an ergodic process , in any subset of the state space is equal to the stationary probability of that subset ( see ) . in other words ,",
    "information about the stationary distribution can be obtained by observing just one trajectory for a sufficiently long time .",
    "such a result can have important applications .",
    "for example , consider a culture with a large number of identical cells with each cell having the same reaction network . if we can show that this intracellular network is ergodic , then by observing the long - term reaction dynamics in a single cell , using for example .",
    "time - lapse microscopy , we can obtain statistical information about all the cells at stationarity .",
    "conversely , ergodicity allows us to obtain the stationary distribution of a single - cell by observing the distribution over the population , using for example flow cytometry .    in this paper",
    "we develop a general framework for checking conditions * sc1 * , * sc2 * and * sc3*. however , the scope of our paper is broader than that . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "we obtain easily computable bounds for the statistical moments of the underlying markov process and investigate when these moments converge with time",
    ". we also present conditions for the distribution of the process to be _ light - tailed_.",
    "in this section we discuss the main results of our paper .",
    "in particular , we explain how conditions * sc1 * , * sc2 * and * sc3 * can be verified without having to simulate the trajectories of the markov process representing the reaction dynamics .",
    "intuitively , these conditions can only hold if the markov process has a low probability of hitting states that have a very large _",
    "size_. in our case , the states are vectors in @xmath82 and so we can measure their _ size _ by using any norm on @xmath82 .",
    "the central theme of this paper is to demonstrate that for many networks , long - term behavior can be easily analyzed by choosing the _ right _ norm for measuring the state sizes .",

    "for now , we assume that a vector @xmath84 satisfying condition * dd * has been found .",
    "in later sections we demonstrate how @xmath84 can be determined for a large class of networks by solving suitably constructed optimization problems .",

    "such a design is crucial because the initial conditions are usually unknown or difficult to control at certain times , e.g. after cell division or after the transfection of plasmids in the cell .",
    "our results on boundedness and convergence of statistical moments enable verification of the suitability of a stochastic model and to characterize the properties of its steady - state distributions , even if such a distribution is not explicitly computable .",
    "one application of this is to provide justifications and insights for using moment closure techniques which have been extensively used to study stochastic chemical reaction networks .",

    "<S> reaction networks are systems in which the populations of a finite number of species evolve through predefined interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such networks are found as modeling tools in many biological disciplines such as biochemistry , ecology , epidemiology , immunology , systems biology and synthetic biology . </S>",
    "<S> it is now well - established that , for small population sizes , stochastic models for biochemical reaction networks are necessary to capture randomness in the interactions . the tools for analyzing such models , however , still lag far behind their deterministic counterparts . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we bridge this gap by developing a constructive framework for examining the long - term behavior and stability properties of the reaction dynamics in a stochastic setting . in particular , we address the problems of determining ergodicity of the reaction dynamics , which is analogous to having a globally attracting fixed point for deterministic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine when the statistical moments of the underlying process remain bounded with time and when they converge to their steady state values . </S>",
    "<S> the framework we develop relies on a blend of ideas from probability theory , linear algebra and optimization theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is notably shown that the computational complexity is often linear in the number of species . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the validity , the efficiency and the of our results on several reaction networks arising in biochemistry , systems biology , epidemiology and ecology . </S>",
    "<S> the biological implications of the results as well as an example of a non - ergodic biological network are also discussed . </S>"
