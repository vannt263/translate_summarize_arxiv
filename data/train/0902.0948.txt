    "some of the simplest non - flat solutions of einstein s equations are the ale ( asymptotically locally euclidean ) hyper - kahler four - manifolds , which can be obtained by a hyper - kahler resolution of a quotient singularity @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a finite subgroup of @xmath2 .",
    "such resolutions can be naturally constructed @xcite as a hyper - kahler quotient of a finite - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "this construction has a natural interpretation in terms of d - branes @xcite and has served as an important example in string theory .",
    "close cousins of these spaces are the alf ( asymptotically locally flat ) hyper - kahler four - manifolds .",
    "these are locally asymptotic at infinity to @xmath3 .",
    "the examples relevant for us are the multi - centered taub - nut solutions of @xcite .",
    "they also can be constructed @xcite as a hyper - kahler quotient of a finite - dimensional flat space , but this fact has not yet been interpreted in terms of branes .",
    "the first goal of the present paper will be , in section 2 , to accomplish this .",
    "for that purpose , we will use the @xmath4-duality @xcite between an ns5-brane localized at a point on @xmath3 , and an alf space .",
    "( this @xmath4-duality has been further studied in @xcite . a related statement that symmetry enhancement by @xmath5 parallel ns5-branes is dual to symmetry enhancement due to an @xmath6 singularity",
    "was first argued in @xcite . ) probing this @xmath4-duality with a suitable d - brane , we arrive at the desired hyper - kahler quotient construction , as well as a new understanding of this somewhat subtle @xmath4-duality .",
    "the construction that we use here is really a special case of a recent construction of instantons on taub - nut spaces @xcite , as will become clear .",
    "a generalization of the fact that an ale space @xmath7 can be described by a hyper - kahler quotient of a flat space is that moduli spaces of instantons on @xmath7 can be described by such quotients @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath7 itself can be regarded as a degenerate case of a moduli space of instantons on @xmath7  it parametrizes d0-branes on @xmath7 , which correspond to instantons of rank 0 and second chern class 1 . the hyper - kahler quotient construction of instantons on an ale space is a natural generalization of the adhm construction of instantons on @xmath8 .",
    "it is also natural in terms of d - branes @xcite , and has served , again , as an important example in string theory .",
    "recently @xcite , a brane construction has been used to describe an analog of the adhm construction for instantons on an alf space .",
    "our goal in section 3 is to use a suitable d - brane probe , analogous to the one used in section 2 , to slightly extend this construction in several directions . among other things ,",
    "we determine the relation between the adhm data and the chern classes of the instanton bundle , and we describe a further relationship to @xmath9-theory at a product of @xmath6 and @xmath10 orbifold singularities .    certain classes of instanton solutions on alf spaces have been constructed directly , for example in @xcite . for somewhat related work on singular monopoles and nahm s equations , see for example @xcite . for more general reviews of nahm s equations ,",

    " s    our basic idea in finding a d - brane construction of taub - nut space as a hyper - kahler quotient is to use the fact that the taub - nut space can be generated @xcite by @xmath4-duality from a configuration consisting of an ns5-brane localized at a point on @xmath11",
    ". we will call this configuration @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath4-dual of @xmath13 without the ns5-brane is simply @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the circle dual to @xmath16 , with the radius inverted ) .",
    "however , @xmath4-duality converts the charge of the ns5-brane into an `` @xmath17-monopole '' charge that is encoded in the geometry . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath4-dual of @xmath12 is a space @xmath18 that at infinity looks like a nontrivial @xmath15 bundle over @xmath19 .",
    "the first chern class of the @xmath15 bundle is 1 ( the original ns5-brane charge ) .",
    "more precisely , the region near infinity in @xmath19 is homotopic to a two - sphere @xmath20 , and the @xmath15 fibration , restricted to this two - sphere , has first chern class 1 .",
    "in fact , @xmath18 coincides with the taub - nut space , which we will call @xmath21 , but it is difficult to show this directly via @xmath4-duality .",
    "the reason for this is that the starting point @xmath12 involves an ns5-brane , which is described by a two - dimensional conformal field theory , but not one which is elementary or known in any explicit form .",
    "consequently , the standard arguments @xcite for determining @xmath18 are slightly abstract .",
    "we recall these arguments for completeness .",
    "the first step is to analyze the symmetries .",
    "because the original configuration @xmath12 has a conserved winding number symmetry , @xmath18 must have a conserved momentum symmetry , that is a @xmath22 symmetry that rotates the fibers of the @xmath15 fibration .",

    "in fact , ) implies that there can not be orbits left fixed by a non - trivial finite subgroup of @xmath22 . ]",
    "the moment map is an @xmath15 fibration everywhere except at the @xmath22 fixed points ( where the radius of @xmath15 shrinks to zero ) .",
    "the first chern class of the fibration at infinity is the number of fixed points , and to get first chern class 1 , we need precisely 1 fixed point .",
    "the unique hyper - kahler four - manifold with this property is @xmath21 , so this must be @xmath18 .    finally , as a check ,",
    "one notes that in the sigma model with target @xmath21 , there is no conserved quantity that corresponds to the winding of strings around @xmath15 .",
    "the reason for this is that a wrapped string can unwind at the fixed point , where @xmath15 collapses to a point .",
    "the dual of this is that in the original sigma model that describes an ns5-brane localized at a point on @xmath11 , there is no conserved momentum along the @xmath16 because translation invariance along the @xmath16 is broken by the presence of the ns5-brane .",
    "the space @xmath21 can be described very simply .",
    "we write @xmath30 for coordinates on @xmath19 , and @xmath31 for an angular parameter on @xmath16 .",
    "a four - dimensional hyper - kahler metric with a triholomorphic @xmath22 symmetry can be put in the general form for this metric to be smooth , @xmath31 has period @xmath32 .",
    "this normalization is used in much of the literature to avoid some factors of 2 , and will be followed in all similar formulas in this paper . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a harmonic function on @xmath19 , and @xmath35 is a @xmath22 connection on @xmath19 such that @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath21 corresponds to the special case of ( [ genf ] ) with @xmath37 here @xmath38 is a constant , which determines the asymptotic radius of @xmath15 .",
    "and @xmath39 is a point in @xmath19 that is given by the position of the ns5-brane in the original description on @xmath11 , projected to the second factor . for @xmath40",
    ", @xmath15 collapses to a point .",
    "( of course , we could remove the dependence on @xmath39 by shifting the coordinates @xmath30 , but we retain it since we will eventually be interested in the relative positions of several ns5-branes . )    as for the projection of the ns5-brane position to @xmath16 , it corresponds to a mode of the @xmath41-field on @xmath21 .",
    "this may be deduced as follows .",
    "the position of the ns5-brane in @xmath16 can , of course , be changed by a rotation of @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath4-dual of the rotation group of @xmath16 is a group of gauge transformations of the @xmath41-field that are asymptotically constant at infinity .",
    "a general @xmath41-field gauge transformation is of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a one - form . by an asymptotically constant @xmath41-field gauge transformation , we mean one such that at infinity @xmath44 , for constant @xmath45 .",
    "we only care about the asymptotic behavior of @xmath43 , because in general two gauge transformations that coincide at infinity act identically on physical states .",
    "moreover , we only care about the value of @xmath45 modulo an integer , because again , a @xmath41-field gauge transformation by a one - form @xmath43 that is closed and whose periods are integer multiples of @xmath46 acts trivially on physical states .",
    "( differently put , the gauge transformation corresponding to @xmath43 is trivial if , when regarded as an abelian gauge field , @xmath43 is pure gauge . )",
    "hence the asymptotic value of @xmath47 is an angle .    in the present case , because the circle @xmath48 shrinks to zero size in the interior of @xmath21 , a one - form @xmath43 that is asymptotic to @xmath49 ( and so has a nonzero integral over @xmath48 ) can not be closed , and therefore a gauge transformation @xmath50 generates a non - trivial shift of the @xmath41-field .",
    "this is dual to the fact that a rotation of the original @xmath16 shifts the position of the ns5-brane .",
    "the @xmath4-dual of the angular position of the ns5-brane is encoded in a @xmath41-field of the form @xmath51 , where at infinity @xmath52 .",
    "the angular position of the original ns5-brane is @xmath47 .",
    "apart from being of the pure gauge form @xmath53 , the two - form @xmath41 that is dual to the fivebrane position should be anti - selfdual ( and in particular harmonic ) for supersymmetry .",
    "it should also be invariant under rotations of @xmath19 around the point @xmath54 , since the original ns5-brane had this property .",
    "in fact , there is a unique anti - selfdual harmonic two - form on @xmath21 with all the right behavior ( apparently first constructed in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , namely @xmath51 with @xmath55 this formula and the previous ones of this subsection have a natural explanation by constructing @xmath21 as a hyper - kahler quotient @xcite , as we will recall in section [ review ] .",
    "the argument of section [ transverse ] for finding the @xmath4-dual of the space @xmath12 is clear but somewhat abstract .",
    "we would like to find a more concrete way to analyze the @xmath4-dual of @xmath12 . to do this",
    ", we will consider a d - brane probe .",
    "the d - brane will be an e1-brane ( a euclidean d - brane of one - dimensional worldvolume ) wrapped on @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a point in @xmath19 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath58 of supersymmetric configurations of the e1-brane is four - dimensional ; the choice of @xmath57 depends on three parameters , and ( at least when the e1-brane is far away from the ns5-brane ) the fourth parameter is the holonomy around @xmath59 of the @xmath22 gauge field of the e1-brane .",
    "@xmath4-duality on @xmath16 , while leaving @xmath58 unchanged , converts the e1-brane to an e0-brane on @xmath18 .",
    "but the moduli space that parametrizes e0-branes on @xmath18 is simply a copy of @xmath18  an e0-brane is supported at a point , which may be any point in @xmath18 .",
    "so @xmath18 is the same as @xmath58 , and in other words , to determine the @xmath4-dual of @xmath12 , it suffices to determine the e1-brane moduli space @xmath58 .",
    "this can be done using arguments of a standard type , and will lead us to an explicit description of @xmath58 or @xmath18 that will coincide with the hyper - kahler quotient construction @xcite of the taub - nut space @xmath21 .",
    "though determining @xmath58 is just a question about the sigma model with target @xmath12 , the steps required to answer it are probably more familiar if we embed the problem in type iib superstring theory .",
    "we take the ten - dimensional spacetime @xmath9 to be @xmath60 all branes we consider will have a worldvolume that includes the first factor @xmath19 , but they will in general have no other factors in common .",
    "such branes will generate at low energies an effective gauge theory on @xmath19 ; we will choose the branes so that this theory has half of the possible supersymmetry ( eight supercharges ) .",
    "the last two factors @xmath61 and @xmath62 are parametrized by triplets of real coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; the corresponding rotation groups @xmath65 and @xmath66 are @xmath67-symmetry groups in the three - dimensional gauge theory . to embed in this context our problem of finding the @xmath4-dual of @xmath12 , we introduce an ns5-brane whose worldvolume is @xmath68 times a point in @xmath69 . thus , @xmath69 , with the embedded ns5-brane , is what we earlier called @xmath12 .",
    "up to a translation symmetry , we can take the ns5-brane to be located at @xmath70 , where @xmath16 , whose circumference we call @xmath71 , is parametrized by a variable @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , we promote the e1-brane wrapped on a circle in @xmath12 to a d3-brane whose worldvolume is @xmath3 times a point in @xmath74 .",
    "since the ns5-brane is invariant under translations in @xmath75 , there is no essential loss in taking the d3-brane to be at @xmath76 .",
    "the value of @xmath30 for the d3-brane parametrizes three of its four moduli .",
    "the effective action on the worldvolume of a stack of @xmath77 d3-branes is four - dimensional @xmath78 super yang - mills theory , with gauge group @xmath79 .",
    "( in our present discussion , we will take a single d3-brane , but the generalization to any number is important later . )",
    "when a d3-brane intersects an ns5-brane , the gauge theory is `` cut . ''",
    "we get separate @xmath79 gauge theories on either side of the ns5-brane , coupled via the existence of a bifundamental hypermultiplet supported at the d3-ns5 intersection .    in the case of d3-branes wrapped on @xmath3 ( the first two factors in @xmath9 ) , their motion in the normal space @xmath74",
    "is described by adjoint - valued scalar fields that we call @xmath30 and @xmath75 .",
    "incorporation of an ns5-brane ( embedded as above ) reduces four - dimensional @xmath78 supersymmetry to what we might call three - dimensional @xmath78 supersymmetry ( with half as many supercharges ) .",
    "invariance under this remaining supersymmetry algebra requires that @xmath75 should be a constant ( which we will take to be zero ) , while @xmath30 should obey nahm s equations . in their gauge - invariant form ,",

    "( for more detail on nahm s equations , see , for example , @xcite or section 2 of @xcite . )",
    "the effect of introducing an ns5-brane at @xmath87 ( eventually we will set @xmath88 ) is that , locally , the d3-branes support separate @xmath79 gauge theories for @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "the upshot is that there is a unique supersymmetric configuration for each choice of @xmath17 , so @xmath118 .",
    "we recall that the expected answer is that @xmath58 should be the taub - nut hyper - kahler four - manifold @xmath21 .",
    "topologically , this is equivalent to @xmath8 , so we are on the right track so far . to determine the hyper - kahler metric of @xmath58 , we repeat the above analysis with more care .",
    "nahm s equations and the boundary condition ( [ telf ] ) can be interpreted in terms of an infinite - dimensional hyper - kahler quotient .",
    "we write @xmath119 for the space of triples @xmath120 .",
    "@xmath119 carries a natural flat hyper - kahler metric that we will write down shortly , and @xmath58 can be interpreted , roughly speaking , as the hyper - kahler quotient of @xmath119 by the group of gauge transformations .    however , constant gauge transformations act trivially on @xmath119 , since _ ( i )",

    "a construction of @xmath58 by a finite - dimensional hyper - kahler quotient , we let @xmath130 be the subgroup of @xmath122 characterized by the condition @xmath430 , @xmath425 , so @xmath130 is a normal subgroup fitting in an exact sequence @xmath431 then setting @xmath432 and @xmath433 , @xmath58 can be constructed as a finite - dimensional hyper - kahler quotient @xmath434 .",
    "explicitly , one finds that @xmath435 , and apart from an extra factor of @xmath3 that is locally decoupled , this gives the construction in @xcite of the lwy metric as a hyper - kahler quotient .",

    "this fact is used to explicitly analyze the one - instanton solution in @xmath2 gauge theory on @xmath154 .",
    "the construction that we have analyzed in section [ probe ] is really a special case of a more general brane construction @xcite of instantons on @xmath154 . in effect , we have been studying the special case of instantons of zero rank and second chern class equal to 1 . an instanton with this property",
    "is a point instanton , represented by an e0-brane supported at a point in @xmath154 .",
    "the moduli space of such e0-branes , which is isomorphic to @xmath154 itself , is precisely what we have been studying , in a @xmath4-dual formulation .    to describe more general instantons on @xmath154 ,",
    "one simply incorporates additional branes in a supersymmetric fashion . in the type iib language in terms of branes on @xmath438",
    "so far we have considered ns5-branes wrapped on @xmath68 ( and localized in @xmath439 ) , along with a probe d3-brane wrapped on @xmath3 . without breaking supersymmetry ,",
    "it is possible to also include d5-branes wrapped on @xmath440 ( and localized in the other factors ) , and additional d3-branes wrapped on @xmath3 .",
    "( this is a familiar supersymmetric brane configuration @xcite , frequently studied in a limit in which the @xmath16 is decompactified and replaced by @xmath441 . )",
    "this also has one very important further refinement : instead of @xmath442 , the support of a d3-brane might be @xmath443 , where @xmath444 is an interval in @xmath16 , bounded by two fivebranes .",
    "we will call a general configuration of this kind an ns5-d5-d3 configuration .    regardless of the details of such a configuration , what happens to it when we perform @xmath4-duality along @xmath16 ?",
    "the @xmath4-dual geometry depends on the positions of the ns5-branes but not of the d - branes ; the reason for this is that @xmath4-duality can be performed in the limit of weak string coupling , where the effects of any finite set of d - branes are infinitesimal .",
    "so the @xmath4-dual geometry is simply the one that we have explored in section [ probe ] : the @xmath4-dual of @xmath152 , that is of @xmath69 with @xmath5 embedded ns5-branes , is the multi - taub - nut space @xmath154 .",
    "@xmath4-duality maps the d5-branes and d3-branes to other d - branes . in particular , the @xmath4-dual of a d5-brane is a d6-brane wrapped on @xmath445 .",
    "if there are @xmath446 d5-branes , we get @xmath446 d6-branes supporting a @xmath447 gauge symmetry .    in section [ probe ] , the @xmath4-dual of a d3-brane on @xmath442 was a d2-brane wrapped on @xmath19 and supported at a point @xmath448 .",
    "however , once we introduce d5-branes , so that the @xmath4-dual description has d6-branes that fill @xmath445 , a d2-brane on @xmath449 can dissolve into an instanton on @xmath154 .",
    "superficially , it seems that the instanton number may be simply the number of d3-branes in the original description via type iib theory on @xmath9 .",
    "this is actually correct if one considers only `` complete '' d3-branes that wrap all the way around the @xmath16 , rather than `` fractional '' d3-branes that are suspended between two fivebranes .",
    "the topological description becomes more complicated when there are fractional d3-branes , since the instanton bundle may have a first chern class .",
    "the topology allows this , as explained in section [ topology ] .",
    "one of the main reasons for re - examining in this section the brane construction of instantons on @xmath154 is to compute the first chern class of the instanton bundle .",
    "we begin in section [ lineb ] with the simplest case that there are d5-branes ( as well as ns5-branes ) but no d3-branes . roughly speaking",
    ", each d5-brane has for its @xmath4-dual a d6-brane that supports a chan - paton line bundle .",
    "( a somewhat more precise statement depends on the @xmath41-field , as described in section [ lineb ] . )",
    "the line bundle depends on the position of the d5-brane .",
    "the chan - paton line bundle supported on the @xmath4-dual to any given d5-brane is flat at infinity on @xmath154 , and has anti - selfdual curvature everywhere by supersymmetry . hence",
    ", this line bundle is one of the line bundles described in section [ lb ] . in section [ lineb ]",
    ", we determine precisely which line bundle over @xmath154 is associated with any given d5-brane .",
    "in particular , we determine both the first chern class and the asymptotic monodromy of this line bundle .",
    "this then automatically determines the chern classes and asymptotic monodromy of the vector bundle  a direct sum of line bundles  associated to any collection of d5-branes , as long as there are no d3-branes .",
    "incorporating d3- branes does not change the monodromy at infinity , since the d3-branes are localized on @xmath159 .",
    "however , the inclusion of d3-branes does change the first chern class .",
    "analyzing this is the goal of section [ moveb ] .",
    "this analysis is based on the ability to reduce any configuration to a more convenient one , without changing the topology , by moving fivebranes along @xmath16 in a judicious fashion .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ all ] by considering the ale limit in which the radius of the circle in ( [ kelkoo ] ) goes to zero , and therefore the radius of the dual circle in the asymptotic taub - nut fibration @xmath415 goes to infinity . in this limit ,",
    "some of our results have a natural @xmath9-theory interpretation .",
    "one obvious question is whether the description of instantons on @xmath154 via branes on the dual geometry @xmath9 of eqn .",
    "( [ kelkoo ] ) is useful .",
    "there are actually two questions here .",
    "( 1 ) can one use this approach to explicitly describe the moduli space @xmath450 of instantons on @xmath154 ?",
    "( 2 ) can one use it to describe the instanton bundles themselves ?    the second question may seem more basic , but it turns out that it is better to start with the first .",
    "the answer to that question is that @xmath450 is the moduli space of supersymmetric vacuum states of the relevant ns5-d5-d3 brane configuration on @xmath9 .",
    "such vacua correspond to solutions of nahm s equations along @xmath16 .",
    "one must solve nahm s equations for the group @xmath451 where @xmath452 is the number of d3-branes .",
    "( if some d3-branes end on fivebranes , @xmath452 may jump as one moves around the circle . )",
    "fivebranes correspond to defects , discontinuities , poles , and jumps in rank in the solution of nahm s equations .",
    "these facts are used in @xcite ; the relevant facts about nahm s equations are also reviewed in detail in @xcite .    in general , one can not explicitly solve nahm s equations , but the description of @xmath450 via nahm s equations is very powerful nonetheless .",
    "for example , one can effectively describe the space of solutions of nahm s equations as a complex manifold in any of its complex structures ( though it is difficult to find the hyper - kahler metric ) .",
    "this fact is exploited in @xcite to show that , as a complex manifold in any of its complex structures , the moduli space of instantons on @xmath154 is independent of the radius of the circle at infinity ( and of the monodromy at infinity ) and coincides with the moduli space of instantons on a corresponding ale space .",
    "for example , as a complex manifold , the moduli space of instantons on the basic taub - nut manifold @xmath21 coincides with the moduli space of instantons on @xmath8 .",
    "the reasoning is briefly sketched in appendix a.    now let us consider question ( 2 ) .",
    "let @xmath453 be an instanton bundle .",
    "for @xmath454 a point in @xmath154 , we would like to find a natural way to use branes to extract @xmath455 , the fiber of @xmath26 at @xmath454 .",
    "moreover , the construction should have the property that as @xmath454 varies , we can extract the connection on @xmath26 .    to do this , we let @xmath456 be the brane on @xmath154 associated to the instanton bundle @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath457 be an e0-brane supported at the point @xmath458 .",
    "actually , in the string theory description , the supports of @xmath456 and @xmath457 are @xmath445 and @xmath449 , respectively .",
    "then the space of @xmath459 string ground states is of a standard hypermultiplet . in topological string theory on @xmath154 , one would get just @xmath460 . ]",
    "@xmath460 , and the instanton connection on @xmath461 can be extracted from the natural connection on the space of @xmath459 string ground states , as @xmath454 varies .    to compute the space of @xmath459 strings",
    ", we use a @xmath4-dual description via branes on @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath456 corresponds to a supersymmetric vacuum of an ns5-d5-d3 system .",
    "this supersymmetric vacuum corresponds to a solution of nahm s equations ; we schematically denote this solution as @xmath462 .",
    "its rank depends on the chosen configuration .",
    "@xmath457 corresponds to a probe d3-brane , wrapped on @xmath3 , of the type that was extensively discussed in section [ probe ] . as in sections",
    "[ concrete ] and [ mulcit ] , the point @xmath458 corresponds to a supersymmetric state of the probe d3-brane which can be described by a rank 1 solution of nahm s equations .",
    "we schematically denote this solution as @xmath463 .",
    "the direct ( or disjoint ) sum of branes @xmath464 can be represented then by a reducible solution of nahm s equations , schematically of the form @xmath465 now to describe the space of @xmath459 strings , we consider solutions of nahm s equations in which the diagonal blocks are kept fixed but the lower left block is allowed to vary .",
    "thus , the space of @xmath459 strings is the space of solutions of nahm s equations of the form @xmath466 where only the block @xmath467 is allowed to vary . when we let the block @xmath463 vary ( so as to vary the choice of a point @xmath448 ) keeping the block @xmath462 fixed , the space of possible @xmath467 s varies as the fiber of a vector bundle @xmath468 .",
    "the hyper - kahler structure of the moduli space of solutions of nahm s equations gives a connection on this fibration , and this is the instanton connection on @xmath26 .",
    "applied to instantons on @xmath8 , constructed from e0-e4 brane systems , the same argument shows that the usual adhm description of the instanton bundles is a corollary of the adhm description of the moduli spaces of instantons .",
    "another application is as follows .",
    "as shown in @xcite ( and as sketched in appendix a ) , the description by nahm s equations implies that , when viewed as a complex symplectic manifold in any one complex structure , certain components of the moduli space of instantons on @xmath154 are independent of the radius of the circle at infinity and the monodromy around this circle .",
    "let @xmath450 be such a component . adding a probe d3-brane and applying the same reasoning to solutions of nahm s equations of the form ( [ pelmo ] )",

    "we suppose that @xmath16 has radius @xmath67 , and we parametrize it by a variable @xmath72 , @xmath471 .",
    "we suppose that there are @xmath5 ns5-branes localized at points @xmath472 .",
    "and we include a d5-brane localized at @xmath473 ( times the origin in @xmath62 ) . for supersymmetry",

    "the @xmath4-dual of this d5-brane will be a d6-brane supported on @xmath445 ( times the origin in @xmath62 ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "this d6-brane is endowed with a chan - paton line bundle , and we want to know which one ; that is , we want to find the map @xmath474 from a d5-brane position to a line bundle @xmath475 .",
    "this formulation is oversimplified because of the role of the @xmath41-field . a @xmath41-field gauge transformation @xmath42 acts on the chan - paton gauge field @xmath83 of a d - brane by @xmath476 . here",
    "@xmath43 can be regarded as an abelian gauge field .",
    "accordingly , a @xmath41-field gauge transformation acts by tensoring the chan - paton bundle of any d - brane by a line bundle @xmath477 ( with connection @xmath43 ) .",
    "thus , under a @xmath41-field gauge transformation , we have @xmath478 , where @xmath479 is independent of @xmath480 .",

    ", we will simply pick one value of @xmath480 , say @xmath483 , and make a @xmath41-field gauge transformation to trivialize @xmath482 .",

    "we can carry this reasoning slightly farther to determine the monodromy at infinity of @xmath482 .",

    "this enables us to define the individual @xmath576 and @xmath575 , not just their differences .",
    "though not invariant , this approach is more convenient than one might think because we have already essentially had to pick a basepoint on @xmath16 in defining the line bundles @xmath482 .",

    "if a fivebrane is moved clockwise all the way around the circle , it crosses from left to right all fivebranes of the opposite type .",
    "so its linking number changes by @xmath5 in the case of a d5-brane , or by @xmath446 for an ns5-brane .      next ,",
    "following @xcite , we want to describe a convenient ordering of the fivebranes .",

    "( @xmath927 depends on @xmath480 and @xmath378 , even though this is not shown in the notation , because @xmath480 and @xmath378 appear in the definition of @xmath45 and @xmath5 . ) as @xmath480 and @xmath378 vary , @xmath928 varies as the fiber of a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath929 .",
    "this is the instanton bundle associated with the given solution of the adhm equations , understood as a holomorphic bundle in a particular complex structure .",
    "now , we consider a @xmath732-invariant solution of the adhm equations , with @xmath732 acting on the spaces @xmath856 , @xmath26 , and @xmath58 as multiplication by @xmath563 , @xmath894 , and @xmath930 , as in appendix a. then in particular , @xmath732 acts on @xmath931 , the fiber of @xmath461 at @xmath932 .",
    "we want to describe this action in terms of the data @xmath388 and @xmath587 of the @xmath6 quiver diagram .",
    "first of all , @xmath563 is completely determined by the geometrical action of @xmath732 on @xmath856 ; @xmath563 acts on @xmath856 with eigenvalues @xmath933 and @xmath934 .",
    "( we can assume that the eigenvectors correspond to @xmath480 and @xmath378 . ) the action of @xmath894 and @xmath930 determines the integers @xmath388 and @xmath587 appearing in a particular @xmath6 quiver ( fig . [ quiver ] ) .",
    "specifically , we decompose @xmath935 where the element @xmath936 acts on @xmath937 and on @xmath938 as multiplication by @xmath895 . then the quiver data are @xmath939 , @xmath940 , as is clear from the derivation of the quiver diagram in appendix a.    to understand how @xmath732 acts on the fiber @xmath931 at the origin , we first set @xmath932 .",
    "this ensures that @xmath732 commutes with @xmath45 and @xmath5 and hence acts on the @xmath941 .",
    "so we can make the decomposition @xmath942 where again the element @xmath936 acts on @xmath943 as multiplication by @xmath895 .",
    "we set @xmath944 .",
    "for each value of @xmath181 , the generalized euler characteristic @xmath945 is independent of @xmath45 and @xmath5 , as long as they commute with the chosen action of @xmath732 .",
    "hence the euler characteristic can again be evaluated at @xmath922 , and is @xmath946 now again , in the case of a solution of the adhm equations that corresponds to a smooth and irreducible instanton bundle , we have @xmath947 .",
    "so all @xmath948 and @xmath949 vanish , and @xmath950 .",
    "hence for a smooth @xmath732-invariant instanton solution , we get @xmath951    the object @xmath927 that appears in this computation is the fiber at the origin of the instanton bundle @xmath461 , so @xmath952 is the dimension of the subspace of this fiber that transforms as @xmath895 .",
    "hence @xmath952 coincides with the object @xmath953 defined in section [ lmon ] , and ( [ zorm ] ) is equivalent to the claimed result ( [ zello ] ) ."
