    "the @xmath7 isobar is a well established nucleon resonance with spin - parity @xmath8 and isospin @xmath9 . due to its coupling to the nucleon - nucleon @xmath10 system via the transitions @xmath11 and @xmath12 this resonance plays an important role in the dynamics of the @xmath13 interaction @xcite as well as in electromagnatic and pionic processes involving the @xmath13 system , cf . ,",
    "e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "for example , unpolarized cross sections of @xmath14-meson production at energies of several hundred mev in many reactions involving the @xmath15 system can be reasonably described by using theoretical models with the @xmath16-excitation explicitely included @xcite .",
    "but even near the pion - production threshold the contributions from @xmath11 transitions are essential for a quantitative description of the reaction @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "also an important part of three - nucleon forces can be related to the @xmath16-isobar excitation , as is widely discussed in the literature , see , for example , refs .",
    "these forces allow to remove the so - called sagara descrepancy @xcite in the unpolarized @xmath18 elastic cross section in the region of the minimum of the cross section @xcite at beam energies 60 - 200 mev .",
    "the contribution of these forces increases with beam energy , since the intermediate @xmath16-isobar comes closer to its mass - shell , and they dominate the unpolarized cross section of @xmath19 elastic backward scattering at 400 - 600 mev , as is seen from model calculations @xcite . finally , the influence of the @xmath16-excitation was shown for in - medium three - body forces too where the @xmath16 generates an repulsive effective interaction @xcite .    despite of this important role one has to concede that the spin dependence of the @xmath11 transition amplitude is not yet well known .",
    "indeed the @xmath11 amplitude was studied in several experimental @xcite and theoretical papers @xcite . however , though a rather satisfactory overall description of available data at intermediate energies could be achieved , there are several unresolved problems concerning specific spin observables in the @xmath20 transition @xcite .",
    "also , while three - body forces related to the @xmath16 contribution are capable of explaining the unpolarized @xmath21 cross section , corresponding investigations of polarization observables show no systematic improvement when such three - body forces are included @xcite .",
    "improved information on the spin dependence of the @xmath11 amplitude might allow to shed light on this issue too .",
    "furthermore , a better knowledge of the spin dependence of the @xmath11 amplitude might be useful for understanding the remarkable variation in the energy dependence of the spin - dependend @xmath22 cross sections @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite , at beam energies 600 - 800 mev .",
    "this variation is considered by some authors @xcite as an indication of dibaryon resonances ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "but since the observed structure lies in the proximity of the nominal @xmath25 threshold it could be closely linked with the properites of the @xmath11 and/or @xmath26 amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the general binary reaction @xmath27 is described by 16 independent spin amplitudes and the determination of all of them is an extremely complicated and challenging experimental task . in collinear kinematics , however , the spin structure of any binary reaction is simplified considerably because only a single physical direction exists in this case , namely the direction of the beam momentum . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of invariant spin amplitudes describing the reactions reduces drastically .",
    "a similar simplification occurs in the threshold regime with the s - wave dominance in the final state of the reaction . under these conditions",
    "it seems rather realistic to perform a complete polarization experiment for the process @xmath20 and , as a result , provide stringent constraints on the pertinent transition amplitudes .",
    "note that the analysis of polarization effects in collinear kinematics with explicit axial symmetry can not be considered as a limiting case of the general formalism developed for binary reactions where the scattering plane is well defined @xcite . for the case of collinear kinematics the corresponding analytical expressions have to be derived anew .",
    "for example , for backward elastic @xmath28 scattering the formalism was developed in @xcite .",
    "the near threshold formalism for polarization phenomena has been recently documented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to derive the formalism for spin observables of binary reactions of the types @xmath29 and @xmath30 in collinear kinematics and to find on this basis the corresponding complete polarization experiments which would allow one to measure all invariant amplitude describing these processes . for this aim",
    "we use the technique of clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite applied recently for collinear kinematics of a binary reaction in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see for details also ref .",
    "our phenomenological analysis of the reactions @xmath11 and @xmath31 is model - independent and based only on parity and angular momentum conservation .",
    "however , in addition , for the reaction @xmath31 we develop also a model within the impulse approximation .",
    "this allows us to connect the three invariant spin amplitudes of the reaction @xmath31 with the four invariant amplitudes of the process @xmath11 . as a result",
    ", the knowledge of all three independent amplitudes of the reaction @xmath31 obtained from a dedicated complete polarizations experiment for this reaction allows one to determine the three independent combinations of the four amplitudes of the reaction @xmath11 .",
