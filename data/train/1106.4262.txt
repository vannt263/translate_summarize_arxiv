    "charmonium production associated with a @xmath8 pair is a good experimental observable in understanding the production mechanism of heavy quarkonium .",
    "the associated production has been extensive studied in the literature . in @xmath9 annihilation at b factories ,",
    "@xmath6 was found to have a very large fraction of @xmath7 inclusive production@xcite .",
    "this phenomena can be understood by a large next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd correction to the color - singlet ( cs ) @xmath6 production@xcite , and a relatively small nlo qcd correction to the cs @xmath10 production@xcite .",
    "these studies also imply that the color - octet ( co ) contribution to @xmath7 production may be very small and even negligible , and a set of severe constraint on the linear combination of related co matrix elements was further obtained by analyzing @xmath7 production in @xmath9 annihilation@xcite . at lep , in the @xmath11 decay , @xmath6@xcite was found to be the dominant contribution to the @xmath7 inclusive production@xcite . on the contrary , in @xmath12 collisions ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath7 associated production @xcite was estimated to be several orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental data of @xmath7 inclusive production@xcite . in hadron collisions at the tevatron",
    ", theoretical predictions@xcite showed that the @xmath6 contribution was significant in the large @xmath1 region compared with the nlo result of non-@xmath8 contributions , and the produced @xmath7 is mainly unpolarized , which is analogous to the polarization of @xmath7 in inclusive production@xcite . the integrated cross section was also significant and showed a great measurable potential both at the tevatron and rhic .",
    "@xmath7 associated production was also considered in the @xmath13 decay@xcite to explore the co mechanism in heavy quarkonium decays .",
    "as shown , most of those studies focused on @xmath7 associated production . however , due to the importance of charmonium associated production , studies of associated production for other charmonium states other than @xmath7 may also be valuable .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a calculation for the p - wave charmonium @xmath0 ( j=0,1,2 ) associated production in hadron collisions in the framework of nonrelativistic qcd(nrqcd)@xcite .",
    "the motivation for this work is two fold .",
    "the first is related to the ratio @xmath4 measured by the cdf collaboration at the tevatron .",
    "cdf found that @xmath14 approaches to about 0.75 at large @xmath1@xcite .",
    "however , if the @xmath0 inclusive production is dominated by the co process ( because the cs contribution at large @xmath1 is suppressed by @xmath15 at leading order(lo ) ) , the value of @xmath14 should tend to be @xmath16 , which is predicted by naive spin counting .",
    "recently , the calculation of nlo qcd correction to @xmath17 inclusive production is performed@xcite and it is found that the nlo correction for cs channel can bring out a @xmath18 term , which makes the cs contribution much important at large @xmath1 , and then by combining cs with co contributions one is able to fit the experimental value of @xmath14 quite well over a wide @xmath1 region .",
    "the @xmath0 associated production with a @xmath19 pair is of the same order in pqcd as the nlo @xmath20 inclusive production and it contains also fragmentation contributions which scale as @xmath18 .",
    "so it is interesting to check whether the @xmath21 associated production is also very large and whether it can further improve theoretical predictions of ratio @xmath14 .",
    "the second reason is that the measurements at the tevatron for the production rates of @xmath6 and @xmath22 are important on shedding light on understanding the @xmath7 production mechanism in hadron collisions . and",
    "the prompt @xmath7 production receives significant feeddown contributions from @xmath23 and @xmath0 .",
    "so it is important to know how large is the feeddown contribution to @xmath7 associated production from @xmath0 associated production .",
    "the result itself in this work can also give information for directly measuring @xmath0 from @xmath5 production at hadron colliders .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc ] we briefly describe our calculation method . in sec .",
    "[ sec : resu ] we give our numerical results and analyze the obtained results . in the last section ,",
    "we give a summary .",
    "in the framework of nrqcd factorization , the cross section for the @xmath21 associated production in proton - antiproton collisions has the following form : @xmath25=&\\sum_{i , j , n } \\int { \\rm d}x_1 { \\rm d}x_2 f_{i / p}(x_1)f_{j/\\bar{p}}(x_2)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times { \\rm d}\\hat{\\sigma}(i+j\\rightarrow c\\bar{c}[n]+c+\\bar{c})\\langle o^{\\chi_{cj}}[n]\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where i , j denote the initial state partons from the proton or anti - proton .",
    "we assume the contribution from light quark annihilation to be negligible , so i , j are gluons in our case .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath26 represent the color and orbital angular momentum of the intermediate @xmath19 states at short - distances , which evolve into the @xmath0 meson at long - distances . at leading order in relative velocity @xmath27 of the @xmath8 pair",
    ", @xmath26 can be taken as @xmath28}$ ] for the cs and @xmath29}$ ] for the co intermediate states .",
    "we use * * feynarts**@xcite to generate feynman diagrams . for the cs case , there are 56 feynman diagrams , of which some representative are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . for the co case , there are 16 extra feynman diagrams relative to the cs case and their extra topology structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "these extra topology structures actually represent gluon fragmentation contributions .",
    "the fragmentation diagrams can give a @xmath18 contribution for the differential cross section @xmath30 , while remained diagrams can at most give @xmath15 terms .",
    "therefore , one may expect the fragmentation contribution is dominant at large @xmath1 .",
    "note that , however , not only the co channel ( @xmath31}$ ] ) have fragmentation contribution , but the cs channel has also quark ( anti - quark ) fragmentation contributions . in fig.[fig:1",
    "] , the diagrams ( b ) and ( k ) represent ( anti-)quark fragmentation contributions in the large @xmath1 approximation , where one of the charm or anti - charm quark fragments to @xmath32 plus another charm or anti - charm quark .",
    "however , only when @xmath1 is large enough , these quark diagrams can reach the fragmentation region and give leading contributions .",
    "otherwise , these quark diagrams can give only small contributions .",
    "we will discuss the fragmentation approximation in the next section .",
    "we use the spinor - helicity method to deal with feynman amplitudes@xcite and use the package * * s@m**@xcite to simplify the feynman amplitudes in spinor form . based on this method ,",
    "the spinor form for massive external fermions can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34(@xmath35 ) are dirac spinors of massive ( anti-)fermion with momentum @xmath36 and spin @xmath37 ; @xmath38 are reference weyl spinors with light - like reference momentum @xmath39 and helicities @xmath40 . in principle , @xmath41 should be along the axis of @xmath42 to guarantee the validity of above equations for individual spin . however , if we just concern about a result by summing over spin , @xmath43 can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "here , it is chosen to be one of the initial partons momentum in order to simplify the calculation .",
    "the polarization vectors for external gluon with momentum @xmath44 and light - like reference momentum @xmath43 are represented as @xmath45 using the following identity , we decouple the spin projection operator@xcite for bound states from feynman amplitudes : @xmath46 where there is a relative velocity @xmath27 between @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the p - wave case . then with the help of fierz transformation ( and its generalized forms ) , the amplitudes are reduced to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the index for different diagrams and @xmath51 are the simplified fermion chains , and the three - gluon vertex are properly dealt with ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the specific expressions of @xmath51 encountered here are listed in the appendix .",
    "we write the polarization tensors for @xmath0 explicitly .",

    "the upper and low limits for @xmath76 and @xmath77 integration are a little complicated so we do nt list them here .",
    "we use vegas @xcite in fortran program to perform the numerical integration .",

    "we show both cs and co contributions to the differential cross section of @xmath87 .",
    "it is found that the co contribution dominates over production in the large @xmath1 region , and it decreases much slower than that of cs as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this seems to conflict with that both of the two channels should behave as @xmath18 at large @xmath1 . to see this point more clearly",
    ", we fit the parton differential cross section ( taking out the influence of pdf ) with @xmath88 , and it turns out that the cs channel scales roughly as @xmath15 while the co channel scales as @xmath18 in the region @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that the co contribution in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] is dominated by gluon fragmentation just as expected , but the cs channel has not reached the ( anti-)quark fragmentation region , and its contribution is still suppressed in the moderately large @xmath1 region ( e.g. , @xmath90 ) .    in order to understand the above mentioned @xmath1 behavior , we study the @xmath91 production as an example .",
    "we calculate ( anti-)quark fragmentation diagrams in axial gauge to include all @xmath18 contributions .",
    "@xmath92 can be set to be 100tev to enable us to calculate at @xmath1 as large as possible .",
    "we find that when @xmath93 , ( anti-)quark fragmentation contribution has a fraction of about 70% of the total differential cross section , and then the fraction rises to about 93% when @xmath94 .",
    "and the fraction reaches 100% ( within the calculation errors ) when @xmath95 .",
    "thus we find that ( anti-)quark fragmentation approximation is only valid for very large @xmath1 ( @xmath96 at least ) , while for the presently interested @xmath1 region ( @xmath97 ) the @xmath18 term induced by ( anti-)quark fragmentation is very small and not important .",
    "this explains the fact that the cs channels in @xmath0 production behave almost as @xmath15 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we depict the differential cross section for @xmath87 and the nlo result for @xmath98 @xcite as comparison .",
    "we find that the contribution from @xmath87 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath99 at small @xmath1 .",
    "the fraction of @xmath87 in total @xmath100 increases gradually and reaches at most 20% at @xmath1 as large as @xmath101 .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath102 fraction lies in the fact that one of the main sources of @xmath98 is the co , which scales as @xmath18 and begins its contribution at order @xmath103 , while the dominant contribution of @xmath87 is suppressed by both @xmath104 and phase space .",
    "based on this analysis , we may conclude that @xmath87 has negligible influence on the @xmath72 inclusive production . as a result , fitting the ratio @xmath14 measured by cdf@xcite",
    "can not be improved by including @xmath102 as compared to the @xmath105 result@xcite .    in the nlo prediction@xcite ,",
    "the feeddown contribution of @xmath106 possesses about 30% of the prompt @xmath7 production rates at @xmath107 at the tevatron , and it can give a great influence on @xmath7 prompt production .",
    "thus we also evaluate the feeddown contribution of @xmath0 to @xmath6 to see whether this contribution is also large . in the calculation",
    ", we ignore the difference between @xmath1 of @xmath7 and @xmath72 .",
    "note that the feeddown from @xmath0 may have important influence on prompt @xmath7 s polarization .",
    "this effect relies on @xmath0 s polarized production rates and also the helicity amplitudes of @xmath72 radiative decays to polarized @xmath7 .",
    "the related formula can be found in ref.@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we only consider the unpolarized @xmath108 production but ignore the polarization effects .",

    "the turning point is at @xmath115 where the feeddown contribution begins to exceed the direct contribution . for @xmath87",

    ", @xmath72 feeddown could become the main source for prompt production of @xmath6 , if @xmath116})\\rangle $ ] is small .",
    "thus when measuring the production cross sections for prompt @xmath6 at hadron colliders , the feeddown effect from @xmath118 can be very important and should be taken into consideration .",
    "we also note that this situation is different from that at b factories , where the @xmath5 production rates in @xmath9 annihilation for both cs and co are very small , and their feeddown contributions to @xmath7 are negligible , therefore , the nlo @xmath6 theoretical results ( including direct and @xmath23 feeddown contributions ) are basically consistent with experimental production rates . at hadron colliders ,",

    ", we investigate the @xmath0 associated production with a charm quark pair @xmath124 at hadron colliders in the framework of nrqcd . by comparing the differential cross sections i.e. the transverse momentum distributions for @xmath0 associated production , we find that co dominates the production rate at large @xmath1 . also , the differential cross sections for associated @xmath0 production are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the nlo result for @xmath86 . as a result",
    ", @xmath5 production has negligible influence on the @xmath14 value measured by the cdf collaboration .",
    "we also evaluate the @xmath0 feeddown contribution to prompt @xmath6 production , and find that the feeddown contribution is very large compared to direct @xmath6 production@xcite at large @xmath1 , which illustrates the importance of @xmath72 feeddown effect in the measurement for @xmath7 associated production cross sections and polarization parameters",
    ". the fragmentation approximation is analyzed and our conclusion is that the fragmentation contribution is dominant for the co channel , while for the cs channel the fragmentation diagrams contribution dominates over the total differential cross section only at the @xmath125 region .    finally , we note that in the @xmath0 associated production , the lo result in @xmath104 has already contained the @xmath126 term , which is the leading term in @xmath127 expansion at large @xmath128 , and high order corrections in @xmath104 can at most give the @xmath126 term , but suffer from suppressions due to extra powers of @xmath104 .",
    "so we expect that high order corrections in @xmath104 can not significantly change the results obtained in this work .",
    "another notable result in this work is that the co contribution dominates over @xmath5 production at large @xmath1 ( say , @xmath129 ) , therefore measuring the process at hadron colliders , especially at the lhc , may provide important information for the production mechanism of heavy quarkonium , while the experiment itself may also be very interesting and challenging in view of the complexity of the measurement .",
