    "the top quark , an up - type quark , and the bottom quark , a down - type quark , together form the third generation of quarks .",
    "both top ( @xmath3 ) and bottom ( @xmath4 ) quarks have spin  @xmath5 .",
    "the top quark has electric charge  @xmath6 and a mass of @xmath7  gev.@xcite the bottom quark has charge @xmath8 and mass @xmath9  gev.@xcite all other quarks ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) are nearly massless in comparison .",
    "the top quark has a lifetime@xcite of @xmath14  s that is much smaller than the strong interaction timescale , and is thereby unique in the quark family , decaying before it can form a bound state with another quark.@xcite thus , the kinematics of the particles from the top quark decay contain information about the bare top quark itself .",
    "the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix `` @xmath15 '' describes quark mixing.@xcite when there are exactly three quark generations , the matrix is unitary , and a global fit to all available precision data constrains the element @xmath2 to be very close to  one.@xcite therefore , in the standard model ( sm ) the top quark decays almost every time to a @xmath16  boson and a @xmath4  quark .",
    "the tiny sm values for @xmath17 and @xmath18 indicate that decays to @xmath19 and @xmath20 are extremely rare.@xcite if there were a fourth quark generation ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , then decays to light quarks could occur more often since @xmath2 would no longer be constrained to have a value near  one .",
    "quarks are sensitive to both the strong and electroweak forces .",
    "the strong force is far more powerful than the electroweak force , and thus top quarks are produced most often at hadron colliders via the decay of a highly energetic virtual gluon to a top quark and a top antiquark ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the rate for this process is about 7  pb at the tevatron,@xcite@xmath24@xcite where it was first observed by the cdf and d collaborations in 1995.@xcite@xmath0@xcite top quarks can also be produced without their antiparticle partner via the electroweak interaction.@xcite@xmath24@xcite in this case , a t - channel virtual @xmath16  boson and a highly energetic bottom quark combine and produce a top quark , or a far off - shell s - channel @xmath16  boson decays to produce a top quark and a bottom antiquark .",
    "a third process is predicted to exist that occurs via both the s - channel and t - channel , when a top quark is produced together with a @xmath16 boson.@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite charge - conjugate processes that produce top antiquarks are expected via the same mechanisms .",
    "contrary to expectations based on the relative feebleness of the electroweak force , the rates for single top quark production are calculated to be quite high , at about 2  pb for the t - channel process and 1  pb for the s - channel process.@xcite@xmath0@xcite this is because higher - order corrections to the tree - level calculations for the t - channel process are large .",
    "( the rate for @xmath25 production is predicted@xcite to be about 0.3  pb and this process is not seen at the tevatron . )",
    "therefore , one might expect searches of the tevatron data at the d and cdf experiments to observe s - channel and t - channel single top quark production rather easily , given that the current datasets are 50 times larger than those used to discover the top quark in 1995 using the pair production mode .",
    "the reason that it has been very difficult to observe single top quark production is not because the signal rate is too low , but because the background processes are over 30 times larger than for top quark pair events .",
    "the main leading order feynman diagrams for strong and electroweak production of top quarks at the tevatron are shown in fig .",
    "[ feynman - top ] .",
    "fermi national accelerator laboratory is the home of the tevatron collider , a 6.3  km circumference proton - antiproton ( ) accelerator with superconducting magnets .",
    "this machine began operating in collider mode ( versus earlier provision of fixed target beams ) in 1985 with only the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) in operation to record the collisions .",
    "the d experiment started operation in 1992 , at which time the collision energy was 1.8  tev .",
    "this was raised in 2001 to 1.96  tev .",
    "the two large multipurpose detectors have similar structures:@xcite@xmath0@xcite they consist of concentric layers of detectors tightly packed around the beampipe at a tevatron collision region to a height of 9  m , with each detector layer having a different purpose .",
    "the inner layers are composed of silicon microstrip detectors , which provide the three - dimensional positions where charged particles pass through .",
    "d has an outer tracking detector of scintillating fibers and cdf has an outer gaseous wire drift chamber .",
    "each of these tracking systems is encased in a solenoid magnet with field - lines parallel to the beampipe ; d s field strength is 2.0  tesla and cdf s is 1.4  t. the magnetic fields curve the tracks of charged particles , which enables their transverse momentum to be measured .",
    "d s magnet has a much smaller radius ( 60  cm ) compared to cdf s ( 150  cm ) since it was retrofitted inside the calorimeter in 2001 .",
    "it therefore does not allow as much space for the tracking detectors , resulting in far fewer hits per track , which makes pattern recognition difficult with resulting lower track reconstruction efficiency and higher fake track rates .",
    "the momentum resolution in d is poorer because of the shorter track length .    outside the central magnets , each detector has layers of calorimetry used to measure the energy of particles and to distinguish between electromagnetic particles ( electron and photons , with or without matching central tracks ) , and jets ( from quarks and gluons ) .",
    "d s liquid - argon / uranium calorimeter is more hermetic and covers a larger angular region ( pseudorapidity @xmath26 versus cdf s @xmath27 , where @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 is the polar angle ) , giving better acceptance for forward jets and missing transverse energy resolution .    outside the calorimeter , d has a muon spectrometer with up to four layers of tracking detectors and a magnetic field strength of 1.9  t. only muons ( and invisible neutrinos ) pass right through the calorimeter and their position and momentum is remeasured here , with wide pseudorapidity coverage to @xmath30 .",
    "cdf also has several layers of muon detectors outside its calorimeters with coverage to @xmath31 .",
    "each detector has a sophisticated multilevel trigger system used to select interesting events from the collisions , which occur every 396  ns .",
    "preparation for a search for single top quark production began at the d experiment in 1994@xcite ( five months before the first observation of top quarks in pair production mode ) .",
    "d published the results of a search using simple kinematic event selection to set upper limits on the cross sections in 2000,@xcite@xmath24@xcite with a follow - up analysis making first use of a multivariate analysis technique , neural networks , to separate signal from background in 2001.@xcite these analyses used 90  pb@xmath32 of data at @xmath33  tev from run  i at the tevatron ( 19921996 ) , when d did not have a silicon vertex detector or central magnetic field and @xmath4  jets were identified via the presence of muons in jets from the @xmath4  decay .",
    "the cdf collaboration also searched tevatron run  i data for single top quark production ; they published upper limits on the cross sections from a cut - based selection in 2002@xcite and a follow - up analysis of the same dataset using neural networks in 2004.@xcite cdf s analyses had the advantage of being able to use secondary vertex @xmath4-jet identification using the silicon vertex detector.@xcite the limits on the cross sections for s - channel and t - channel production were about 1020 times greater than the predicted values .",
    "the tevatron collision energy was increased to 1.96  tev in 2001 , and the beam intensity was improved by a factor of about 15 over the course of the run ( 2002present ) .",
    "the d and cdf detectors were significantly upgraded , with the addition amongst other things , of the central solenoid magnet to d and very large silicon tracking systems at both experiments.@xcite@xmath0@xcite cdf analyzed 160  pb@xmath32 of run  ii data using a cut - based selection and a maximum - likelihood fit to the variable `` lepton charge @xmath34 untagged jet pseudorapidity '' and set 95% confidence level ( cl ) upper limits of 13.6 pb on s - channel production and 10.1  pb on t - channel production in 2005.@xcite d analyzed 230  pb@xmath32 of data using neural networks ( nn ) for signal - background separation and a bayesian binned likelihood calculation using the nn output distributions , and set 95% cl upper limits of 6.4  pb in the s - channel and 5.0  pb in the t - channel in 2005.@xcite@xmath0@xcite    the next step in the search led to a major improvement .",
    "the d collaboration increased its dataset by a factor of four to 0.9  fb@xmath32 , switched the search to @xmath35+@xmath36 combined ( assuming the sm ratio of the two parts ) , loosened the selection cuts and used an improved @xmath4-jet identification algorithm to increase the signal acceptance by 13% over that obtained in the earlier analysis , and applied three multivariate methods to separate signal from background to reach 3.4  standard deviation ( @xmath37 ) significance for a single top quark signal .",
    "the measured cross section for @xmath35+@xmath36 production combined was @xmath38  pb . the measurement significance represents a probability of 0.035% for the background to have fluctuated up and given a false measurement of signal with a cross section of at least 4.9  pb . a significance greater than 3@xmath37 is considered in the high energy physics community not to be sufficient for a claim of discovery or first observation ( which is set at 5@xmath37 ) , but is high enough to indicate that `` evidence '' for the process in question has been seen ; it is a very exciting threshold to reach . the result was published in 2007 and has received well over 100 citations to date.@xcite small improvements were made to the analysis and a slightly more significant result ( 3.6@xmath37 ) was published in a long paper in 2008.@xcite@xmath0@xcite the cdf collaboration performed a similar analysis on 2.2  fb@xmath32 of data and reached a significance for single top quark signal of 3.7@xmath37 , published in 2008.@xcite they measured the cross section for @xmath35+@xmath36 production to be @xmath39  pb .",
    "after the `` evidence '' papers , the d and cdf collaborations each worked to improve their analysis methods and apply them to larger datasets . both collaborations select events with one isolated high transverse momentum ( @xmath40 ) lepton ( electron or muon ) and large missing transverse energy ( ) , indicative of a leptonic @xmath16-boson decay , together with two , three , or four jets .",
    "one or two of the jets is identified as originating from a @xmath4  quark , which could be from the top quark decay or produced together with it .",
    "the cdf collaboration has an additional independent search channel@xcite that requires no identified charged lepton , which picks up events lost to electron or muon identification inefficiencies , and some @xmath41+jets events where the @xmath41 decayed hadronically ( but there was no explicit @xmath41 reconstruction ) .",
    "this is the first time that the + jets channel has been used in a single top quark measurement .",
    "both collaborations include signal and background events in their lepton+jets channels with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "neither includes events with @xmath46 in the signal acceptance since hadronic @xmath41 reconstruction is difficult .",
    "a new search based just on this decay channel has recently been completed by d.@xcite    after event selection , the signal - to - background ratio is approximately 1:20 .",
    "the backgrounds are mostly @xmath16+jets events ( especially at low jet multiplicity ) , followed by pairs ( especially at high jet multiplicity ) , with small contributions from @xmath47+jets , dibosons ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , and multijets .",
    "top pairs look like signal when one @xmath16  boson decays leptonically ( @xmath51 or @xmath52 ) and the other decays hadronically ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc . ) producing lepton+jets events , and also when both @xmath16 s decay leptonically and event reconstruction fails to identify one of the leptons .",
    "@xmath47+jets events and some diboson processes also mimic single top quark signals when the @xmath47  boson decays to a pair of leptons ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) and one of the leptons is lost , generating fake .",
    "multijet events look like signal in the electron channel when a jet is misidentified as an electron and a jet s energy is mismeasured , creating false . in the muon channel ,",
    "the multijet background comes mostly from events where one of the @xmath4 s decays to a muon that travels wide of its jet or the jet is not reconstructed ( its energy is too low maybe ) .",

    "the dataset is split in two parts ( `` run  iia '' and `` run  iib '' ) to denote a significant upgrade to the detector , when a new layer of silicon microstrip detectors was added around the beampipe.@xcite this improved the tracking and efficiencies .",
    "the run  iib half dataset has higher instantaneous luminosity than the run  iia half , which lowers the primary vertex identification efficiency and increases track multiplicities in the events .",

    "the change increases the signal acceptance by 16% in the electron channel and 20% in the muon channel .",
    "it also increases the trigger efficiency to @xmath57 , meaning that no correction functions are needed to model trigger turn - on curves for monte carlo events .",

    "the alpgen distributions are too narrow , and empirical reweightings are applied to these distributions ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 for d , similarly for cdf ) to make the background model match data before @xmath4  tagging .",
    "since d s reweighting uses binned functions derived in each analysis channel separately , it also takes account of imperfections of the detector model in the intercryostat regions .",

    "there are several requirements on where the energy is deposited to reject noisy jets ( whose energy would be mismeasured ) .",

    "cells in the coarse ( outer ) hadronic calorimeter are only added if they form part of a good jet .",
    "this quantity is corrected for all the energy corrections applied to other objects in the event and for the momentum of isolated muons .",

    "the analyses start out with very large numbers of events in data and mc signal and background samples . for example , d uses data skims with one electron or one muon in them , which contain 1.2  billion events , and 85  million mc events . from these samples , the analyses first select events that look like signal and reject events that do not .",
    "that is , each collaboration devises selection cuts designed to keep as many mc signal events as possible while rejecting as much background as they can .",
    "the d collaboration chooses to maximize signal acceptance while allowing for a slightly worse signal - to - background ratio , whereas the cdf collaboration chooses tighter selection cuts that produce a lower signal acceptance but better signal - to - background ratio .",
    "thus , although d starts the analysis with about 30% less integrated luminosity to analyze than cdf , they end up with more expected signal events in the lepton+jets channel , and a similar number in total when considering also the + jets channel after all selections are applied .",
    "d pursues this strategy because their studies show that the overall sensitivity of the analysis is proportional to the signal acceptance .",
    "the kinematic cuts used in the analyses are shown in table  [ selection - cuts ] .",
    "for simplicity , only the cuts in the channels with exactly two jets are shown , since these channels contribute most to the analysis sensitivity .",
    "for the lepton+jets analyses , both collaborations also use events with three jets , and d also uses events with four jets .",
    "these channels have slightly harder cuts for electron @xmath40 , , and total transverse energy @xmath120 than those shown in the table , to reject the higher multijets background .",
    "motivation for d s choice of lower transverse energy thresholds and wider jet pseudorapidity distributions than used in , for example , a top pairs measurement can be seen in fig .",
    "[ parton - kinematics ] for the t - channel single top quark process .",
    "the light quark that radiates the @xmath16  boson has a very wide @xmath110 distribution in both the forward and backward directions ( shown by the red histograms in the plots ) .",
    "this is a very strong signature for single top quark production that will be used as a powerful variable to separate signal from background .",
    "the soft @xmath61 produced from the gluon splitting has an even wider @xmath110 distribution ( dark green histograms ) and low @xmath40 , and finding this jet increases the double-@xmath4-tagged signal acceptance .",
    "there are additional selection cuts not shown in table  [ selection - cuts ] . in the lepton+jets channels , events are rejected if there is a second isolated lepton , which rejects dilepton decays of , @xmath47+jets , and diboson events .",
    "d has an upper cut on of 200  gev to reject misreconstructed events .",
    "both collaborations throw out events with low just above the cut thresholds when it is aligned or back - to - back with one of the objects in the event , indicative of a misreconstructed event .",
    "the primary vertex must be clearly identified and near the center of the detector , and the lepton must originate from it . the regions between d s central and end calorimeter cryostats are tricky to instrument and model accurately , and if the leading jet in the muon analysis channel points to this region , the threshold on it is raised to 30  gev . finally , d has cuts on muon track curvature significance designed to reject events where the muon has been misreconstructed . in cdf s + jets analysis , a neural network with 15 input variables",
    "is trained to separate the multijets background from signal and a cut is placed on the output distribution .",
    "after the kinematic event selection , d s background samples retain 4  million mc events and 0.8  million multijet data events , and there are 0.5 million single top quark signal mc events .",
    "the signal data contain 114,777 events , with predicted background components : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath47+jets = 6% , dibosons = 2% , = 1% , and multijets = 5% .",
    "the expected single top quark signal is @xmath125 and @xmath126 , with a signal - to - background ratio for @xmath35+@xmath36 of 1:260 .",
    "clearly , an additional method is needed to select events for the analyses to stand any chance of finding the single top quark signal .",
    "the most powerful part of event selection is the identification of jets that originate from @xmath4  quarks .",
    "the algorithms use the long decay time of the @xmath79  hadrons ( mean lifetime @xmath127",
    "s ) which results in detached secondary vertices in the jets ( @xmath128  mm between the primary and secondary vertices ) , together with other information about the tracks to find @xmath4  jets . the tagging algorithms are applied directly to jets in data and to most mc events at cdf , and are modeled with tag - rate functions for mc events at d together with taggability - rate functions to reproduce the detector geometric acceptance and operating efficiency . for @xmath16+light jets mc , cdf uses tag - rate functions measured in multijets data .",
    "@xmath4-jet identification is implemented at d by combining all the track and vertex information using a neural network.@xcite cdf uses the significance of the decay length of the secondary vertex in the ( @xmath129 ) plane for the lepton+jets and + jets channels,@xcite and also a jet probability algorithm in the + jets channel.@xcite depending on where a cut is put on these variables , one can define looser or tighter @xmath4  tagging , where `` loose '' means higher probability to tag a @xmath4  jet ( 58% for @xmath4  jets within d s silicon microstrip tracker fiducial geometric acceptance ) with associated higher probability to mistag a non-@xmath4 jet ( 17% for charm jets and 1.8% for light quark and gluon jets ) , and `` tight '' means a lower @xmath4-tag probability ( 47% for @xmath4  jets at d ) with associated lower fake tag rates ( 10% for @xmath12  jets and 0.5% for light jets ) .",
    "d requires one tight - tagged jet ( and no loose - tagged jet ) for its single - tagged analysis channels , and two loose - tagged jets for its double - tagged channels .",
    "cdf has one set point for both single - tagged and double - tagged lepton+jets channels , with efficiencies of 50% ( @xmath4 ) , 9% ( @xmath12 ) , and 1% ( @xmath94 ) for fiducial jets within the silicon detector tracking system .      to improve the sensitivity of the measurement , both d and cdf split their datasets into independent channels using the jet multiplicity ( 2 , 3 ; and 4 for d ) , number of @xmath4-tagged jets ( 1 or 2 ) , lepton flavor ( d only , electron or muon ) , trigger type ( cdf only , lepton , for muon+jets ) and data - collecting period ( d only , run  iia and run  iib ) , giving 24 independent lepton+jets analysis channels for d and eight for cdf .",
    "cdf s + jets channel with no isolated lepton is split by the number and type of @xmath4  tags ( one secvtx - tagged jet , two `` secvtx''-tagged jets , and one `` secvtx '' and one `` jetprob''-tagged jet ) .",
    "measurements are made in each channel and combined at the end of the analysis .",
    "the signal - to - background ratios vary from 1:10 ( 2-jets/2-tags ) to 1:37 ( 4-jets/2-tags ) for d , with the most important 2-jets/1-tag channels having s : b = 1:20 .",
    "cdf s channels have s : b = 1:15 in the 2-jets channels ( 1-tag and 2-tag combined ) , s : b = 1:23 in the 3-jets channels , and s : b = 1:23 in the + jets channels .",
    "after all event selections have been applied , the signal acceptances ( percentage of total cross section ) for d are @xmath130 for the s - channel @xmath35 process and @xmath131 for the t - channel @xmath36 process .",
    "the t - channel process has a lower acceptance because the @xmath61 jet has low transverse momentum and is difficult to identify .",
    "cdf s signal acceptances in the lepton+jets channels are 2.7% for the @xmath35 process and 1.8% for the @xmath36 process .",
    "these values are lower than d s because of the more restrictive trigger requirements , tighter kinematic selection , and tighter @xmath4  tagging in the double - tagged channel .",
    "in addition , cdf has the + jets channel with a signal acceptance of 1.1% for @xmath35+@xmath36 combined .",
    "table  [ event - yields ] shows the numbers of signal and background events expected , and the numbers of data events found . for simplicity here , all analysis channels have been combined .",
    "four notes to understand the table are in order : ( i ) remember that d uses @xmath132  gev and cdf uses 175  gev for single top signal and background , with associated higher theory cross sections for the lower top quark mass .",
    "they each also use different theory calculations for these values : for single top , d uses kidonakis 2006 values of @xmath133  pb ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath134  pb ( @xmath36),@xcite and for they use the kidonakis and vogt 2003 value of @xmath135  pb ( where the uncertainty includes a component for the top quark mass).@xcite cdf uses for single top the harris _",

    "_ 1998 value of @xmath138  pb.@xcite thus , direct comparison of the signals and backgrounds needs one or other experiment s numbers to be rescaled to be valid .",
    "( ii ) d s analysis includes channels with four jets and cdf s does not , so the fraction of events expected by d is higher than at cdf when showing yields with all channels combined .",
    "however , when one considers each jet multiplicity channel separately , then the relative fractions of @xmath16+jets , , etc .",
    "are very similar between the two experiments .",
    "( iii ) cdf s + jets channel @xmath16+jets yield does not include @xmath92 where @xmath94 = a light jet .",
    "s + jets channel multijets yield includes also the @xmath92 events .",
    "figure  [ w - transverse - mass ] shows the reconstructed @xmath16  boson transverse mass distributions from d ( all channels combined ) and cdf ( lepton+2jets channels ) .",
    "the transverse mass is defined as : @xmath139",
    "any analysis of the data is only valid if the background models reproduce the data in all variables used for event selection and to separate signal from background .",
    "in addition to checking the background model agreement with data for these distributions for every particle in each analysis channel , extensive cross checks using other data samples have been performed to ensure the separate components of the background model are accurately modeled .",
    "samples that pass all selection cuts are used before @xmath4  tagging to certify the shape of the @xmath16+light jets background model .",
    "the @xmath16+heavy flavor background model s agreement between data and background model in both shape and normalization is checked using a sample with exactly two jets , with one @xmath4  tagged , and @xmath140  gev in d s analysis .",
    "finally , the background is validated in both normalization and shape using data and mc samples with four jets , one or two @xmath4  tags , and , for d only since they have softer object @xmath119 requirements , @xmath141  gev .",
    "many distributions are checked using these three cross - check samples and good agreement between data and background model is found .",
    "figure  [ cross - checks ] shows the transverse mass of the @xmath16  boson as an example .",
    "the uncertainties in all searches are dominated by the statistical uncertainty from the size of the data sample . however , once there is enough data to observe and measure a signal , then systematic contributions to the total uncertainty become important .",
    "the total uncertainty on the cross section measurement by d is @xmath142 , and for cdf it is @xmath143 in the lepton+jets channel , @xmath144 in the + jets channel , and @xmath145 with these channels combined .",
    "the contribution from the data statistics in d s measurement is @xmath146 , leaving @xmath147 from systematic components .",
    "normalization systematic uncertainties and shape - dependent systematic uncertainties are considered separately for each signal and background source in each analysis channel .",
    "the overall background uncertainty varies between 7% and 15% for the individual channels in d s measurement .",
    "shape and normalization uncertainties combined result in 20% uncertainties on the background model for single - tagged channels and 40% uncertainties on background for double - tagged channels , for events most like signal .",
    "the uncertainties on the background model for events most like background about 10% for single - tagged channels and",
    "15% for double - tagged channels .",
    "d measures systematic uncertainty contributions from 23 different sources .",
    "others were considered but found to be negligible .",
    "the largest source of systematic uncertainty comes from the @xmath4-id tag - rate functions , including both normalization and shape parts , followed by the jet energy scale calibration ( also normalization and shape ) , and the heavy - flavor correction factor for the @xmath82 and @xmath81 fractions in the mc model .",
    "smaller contributions ( in descending order ) come from the integrated luminosity , the jet energy resolution , initial - state and final - state radiation , @xmath4-jet fragmentation , the pairs cross section , and lepton identification .",
    "cdf s analyses include normalization uncertainty terms from 16 sources , and shape terms from a subset of nine sources .",
    "the most important ones are the jet energy scale , the event detection efficiency , and the @xmath82 , @xmath81 , and @xmath93 scale factor .",
    "the sensitivity to observe a signal with a large background is greatly improved by finding a variable that has a different shape for signal than for background .",
    "one can then keep only events in the maximal - signal region and measure a cross section by counting events if there is enough data , or , as in the case of single top quark production with only a few inverse femtobarns of data , one can perform a binned likelihood calculation comparing the shapes of the expected signal and background to data across the full distribution to further improve the sensitivity . since the kinematics of single top quark events lie between those of the dominant lower - energy @xmath16+jets and higher - energy backgrounds ,",
    "it is not possible to find a single simple variable with which to perform this calculation .",
    "hence , d and cdf each combine many variables using several different methods to increase the signal - background separation power .",
    "d uses three discrimination methods and cdf uses five in the lepton+jets channel , one in a separate s - channel @xmath35 search , and one in the + jets channel , which are briefly described here ; more details are available elsewhere.@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite      d uses 97 discriminating variables in its final analysis , chosen from a much longer list to include only those variables with a different distribution for signal and at least one of the background components,@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite and also to have good agreement between the shape of the background sum and data .",
    "the variables fall in five categories : object kinematics , event kinematics , jet reconstruction , top quark reconstruction , and angular correlations .",
    "the most powerful ones for separating single top quark signal from the @xmath16+jets and backgrounds in each category are shown in table  [ variables ] .",
    "some comments on the notation are in order .",
    "the numbering @xmath148 of jet@xmath148 , tag@xmath148 , light@xmath148 , etc . refers to the transverse momentum ordering of the jets , 1 is the highest @xmath40 jet of that type of jet , 2 is the second - highest @xmath40 jet , and so on .",
    "`` tag '' means a @xmath4-tagged jet .",
    "`` light '' means an untagged jet ( it fails the @xmath4-tag criteria ) .",
    "`` best '' means the jet which , when combined with the lepton and missing transverse energy , produces a top quark mass closest to 170  gev ( the value at which d s analysis is performed ) .",
    "`` notbest '' means any jet that is not the best jet .",
    "`` alljets '' means include all the jets in the event in the global variable .",
    "@xmath40 is the transverse momentum .",
    "@xmath149 is the particle s energy .",
    "@xmath150 is the particle s charge .",
    "@xmath120 is the scalar sum of the particles transverse energies .",
    "@xmath151 is the invariant mass of the objects .",
    "@xmath152 is the transverse mass of the objects .",
    "@xmath153 is the transverse momentum of the muon closest to the jet relative to that jet . s1 and s2 are the two solutions for the neutrino longitudinal momentum when solving the @xmath16  boson mass equation , and s1 is the smallest absolute value of the two ( the preferred value ) .",
    "@xmath154 is the difference between 170  gev and the reconstructed top quark mass using the jet and neutrino solution that make the mass closest to 170  gev .",
    "finally , subscripted text in the cosines indicates the rest frame in which to measure the variable in question .",
    "`` cm '' is the center of mass frame of the whole final state .",
    "the cdf collaboration uses fewer variables with their discriminants , but they have one very powerful variable not developed by d : the jet flavor separator.@xcite this takes all parameters that describe the tracks in @xmath4-tagged jets and combines them using a neural network to calculate a probability that the jet is a bottom jet , or a charm or light quark or gluon jet .",
    "this variable increases the signal - background separation sensitivity by 15% .",
    "a decision tree@xcite applies sequential cuts to the events but does not reject events that fail the cuts .",
    "the choice of variables and cuts at each level of the tree is made by training the trees on large sets of signal and background mc events .",
    "boosting@xcite averages the results over many trees and improves the performance by about 20% .",
    "d pioneered the use of boosted decision trees ( bdts ) to separate signal from background in the single top search in 2006.@xcite@xmath0@xcite they use custom code with 64 input variables from the total list of 97 , and 50 boosting cycles with a separate set of bdts for each of the 24 analysis channels.@xcite@xmath0@xcite the same variables are used in every analysis channel , since the bdts ignore ones that do not show sensitivity in any particular channel . with bdts , there is also no need to split the signal and background samples by subcomponent to improve the sensitivity ( which is beneficial with traditional neural networks@xcite ) , since they handle the varying kinematics without problem .",
    "the cdf collaboration also uses bdts , recently included in the tmva package in root.@xcite they use 22 variables for 2-jet events and 29 for 3-jet events , with 400600 boosting cycles.@xcite they train four sets of bdts in total , since they combine electron and muon channels and the two trigger types . after boosting , the distributions of both signal and background are highly centralized between zero and one . in order to avoid using bins in the final calculation with predicted signal or data but no predicted background ,",
    "d transforms its output distributions ( from all three discriminant methods , not just bdts ) to ensure that every bin has at least 40 background events .",
    "this transformation clusters the background events near zero and the signal events near one , and avoids instabilities in the final cross section measurement .",
    "d made the first particle search using neural networks ( nns ) to separate signal from background in 2001.@xcite the type used were multilayer feed - forward perceptrons from the mlpfit package.@xcite cdf uses nns in the observation analysis for the lepton+jets channels with 14 input variables,@xcite and for the + jets channels with 11 variables.@xcite the networks in the lepton+jets channels come from the commercial neurobayes package.@xcite despite its name , it is not a bayesian nn package as described in the next subsection .",
    "the networks are trained on the same events as used with the bdts to obtain the weights between nodes and thresholds at the nodes .",
    "an independent set of events is used to test the networks after each training cycle to avoid overtraining . since nns use all input variables ( unlike bdts , which ignore ones not found to be useful ) ,",
    "care must be taken not to include variables with insufficient separation power uncorrelated from the other variables , otherwise noise is introduced into the system and the separation can decrease .",
    "this is the reason why far fewer variables are used with nns than with bdts .",
    "d introduced the use of bayesian neural networks ( bnns)@xcite for signal - background separation in the 2006 single top evidence analysis.@xcite@xmath0@xcite like traditional nns , a short list of input variables must be chosen , and d uses the rulefit package@xcite to select between 18 and 28 variables per analysis channel .",
    "the networks have 20 hidden nodes .",
    "the bayesian part of this technique is to average over many networks in each channel using the markov - chain mc sampling technique.@xcite d uses 300 networks in each of the 24 analysis channels , with the final result in each channel being taken from an average of the last 100 networks in the chain.@xcite this averaging process makes the discrimination insensitive to details of which events are used in training , so it is not possible to overtrain the networks , although closure tests are performed using independent events to verify convergence .",
    "it is also not necessary to split the signal and background components with separate networks for optimal separation .",
    "the averaging process also improves the signal - background separation , since it is not dependent on the choice of starting parameters for the weights between nodes or thresholds at the nodes , which can lead to solutions at local minima which are not optimal without the averaging .",
    "both d and cdf use matrix elements ( mes ) to separate signal from background.@xcite@xmath0@xcite d developed the method to measure the top quark mass in 2004,@xcite and was the first to apply them to signal - background separation in the 2006 single top evidence analysis.@xcite@xmath0@xcite the matrix elements correspond to signal and background probability densities .",
    "d calculates matrix elements for three signal processes in the 2-jets channel and five in the 3-jets channel , together with eight background processes in the 2-jets channel and three in the 3-jets channel .",
    "the proton and antiproton are modeled using parton distribution functions and detector resolutions are taken into account using jet resolution transfer functions .",
    "the calculations are extremely cpu - intensive , and take many months to complete . to improve the sensitivity , d splits the analysis into events with @xmath156  gev ( mainly @xmath16+jets background ) or @xmath157  gev ( mainly and hard @xmath16+jets background ) .",
    "cdf has an analysis that uses likelihood functions for signal - background separation with @xmath35+@xmath36 as signal.@xcite they also search separately for only the s - channel @xmath35 process , using different likelihood functions and input variables.@xcite likelihoods are much simpler than nns , they need no training on signal or background event samples , and do not take correlations between the variables into account . in the 2-jet channels ,",
    "cdf s likelihoods combine seven variables , including two powerful ones : the logarithm of the matrix element , and the jet flavor separator . in the 3-jet channels ,",
    "10 variables are combined .",
    "the measurements from each discrimination method are correlated , but by less than 100% , and the discriminant outputs may thus be combined to improve the precision of the final measurement .",
    "d measures the correlation between its three analysis methods ( bdt , bnn , me ) using an ensemble of pseudodatasets containing background and sm signal , and finds the correlation to be 74% between bdt and bnn , 60% between bdt and me , and 57% between bnn and me . to combine the three measurements in each of the 24 analysis channels , d uses an additional set of bnns , each with three inputs and six hidden nodes .",
    "cdf uses an innovative method to combine its lepton+jets measurements : neuro - evolution of augmenting technologies ( neat).@xcite this is a method for evolving neural networks with a genetic algorithm .",
    "evolution starts with small simple networks that become increasingly complex over sequential generations .",
    "the networks are trained to give the best expected p - value ( significance ) for the result .",
    "this is unlike how traditional nns are optimized during training , when the error function ( signal - background similarity ) is minimized .",
    "the neat networks are also used to optimize the binning for the measurement .",
    "figure  [ final - outputs ] shows the final output distributions for all analysis channels combined .",
    "the distributions from the combination discriminants from 24 independent lepton+jets analysis channels at d and eight lepton+jets plus three + jets channels at cdf are used in a bayesian binned likelihood calculation to extract the single top quark cross section .",
    "a flat nonnegative prior is used for the signal cross section .",
    "all systematic uncertainties on background normalization and shape and signal acceptance and their correlations are taken into account .",
    "the shape uncertainties from the jet energy scale are smoothed from bin to neighboring bin during the calculation . using",
    "the full range of the discriminant outputs for this calculation means that the high statistics background - dominated region ( near zero ) is used to constrain the uncertainties on the much smaller background in the expected - signal - dominated region ( near one ) .",
    "the signal cross section central value is taken from the position of the peak of the posterior density distribution , and the uncertainty on the cross section ( statistical and systematic components combined ) comes from the width of the distribution about the peak that encompasses 68% of its area ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the cross section calculations are also performed using the outputs from each discriminant method separately , and using subsets of the data ( all electron+jets channels , all 2-jets channels , all 1-tag channels , and so on ) to check for consistency , which is found within the statistical uncertainty on the measurements .      to check that the discriminants do not introduce a bias into the measured cross section , d generates eight ensembles of pseudodatasets and runs them through the entire analysis chain .",
    "each ensemble contains about 7,000 sets of events , where the sets are constructed to each reproduce d s 2.3  fb@xmath32 real dataset .",
    "signal and background events are sampled from the mc event sets after all event selection cuts such that the numbers of each background component match the measured yields , smeared by poisson statistics . all systematic uncertainties and their correlations between background and signal subcomponents are included in the calculations .",
    "the single top quark signal cross section is set at a different value spanning the range from 2  pb to 10  pb for each ensemble .",
    "for the three discrimination methods and for their combination , a plot is produced with the measured signal cross section versus the input signal cross section , and a fit made to the eight points .",
    "for all cases , the slope of the fitted relation is close to one and the intercept is close to the origin , which shows that the measured cross section , if it lies in this range , accurately represents the signal cross section in the data .",
    "the measured single top quark cross sections are shown in table  [ cross - sections ] .",
    "the expected and measured significances of each measurement are also shown ; these are explained in the next section .",
    "after the two collaborations submitted their independent measurements for publication , they worked together to combine them into one tevatron result.@xcite the systematic uncertainty terms are classified to map between the two measurements so that correlations of some terms between the two measurements are properly taken into account .",

    "the expected significance comes from the p - value which is the probability that the background fluctuated up to give a cross section at least as large as the standard model theory value .",
    "the p - values are converted to significances in standard deviations ( @xmath37 ) assuming a gaussian distribution .",
    "d measures these p - values using an ensemble of about 70 million pseudodatasets , each consisting of only background events with no signal events , by determining the fraction of pseudodatasets with a high enough cross section .",
    "cdf calculates the p - values by finding when the quantity @xmath159 is less in pseudodatasets than in real data .",

    "the measured cross sections are consistent with nlo theory predictions .",
    "the analyses have been improved in many ways to achieve this , in particular over the years of the search :    * d s innovations *    next - to - leading order simulation of signals with full spin information included    very loose kinematic cuts and use of all possible triggers to select more signal - like data and increase signal acceptance    multivariate techniques : bdts , bnns , and mes used to improve signal - background separation    very large number of variables , including many not used at the tevatron before such as jet widths , to separate signal from background    rebinning the discriminant outputs to ensure no bin has data or expected signal and no background events , which stabilizes the cross section measurement    * cdf s innovations *    including data with no identified lepton to extend the signal acceptance    jet flavor separator variable to discriminate @xmath4  jets from mistagged charm , light quark , and gluon ones after @xmath4  tagging    combining different measurements using the neat algorithm optimized to maximize the expected signal significance    binned likelihood fit to a discriminating variable shape to improve the measurement sensitivity    as the reader can see from these lists and the previous analysis descriptions , each collaboration has learned from the innovations of the other one , and the outcome is a deep understanding of the signals and multicomponent backgrounds in many analysis channels , with powerful new analysis techniques developed to extract a small signal from a very large background .",
    "many of these techniques are now being applied to the search for the higgs boson at the tevatron , and the single top datasets are providing a unique place in which to test various aspects of the standard model and search for new physics.@xcite@xmath24@xcite",
    "i have worked with a large number of people from the d collaboration on this measurement and previous iterations over the past 15 years .",
