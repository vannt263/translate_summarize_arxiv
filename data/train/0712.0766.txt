    "the higher collision velocities of larger grains makes them shatter upon impact and prevents them from growing further . yet we know that they must reach planetesimal sizes .",
    "how they overcome the decimetric barrier is the subject of much debate .",
    "part of the solution to this problem could be found in the reduction of collision velocities via the increase of the dust layer density .",
    "this can be achieved by the settling of dust to the disk midplane .",
    "dust is also essential to the interpretation of disk observations .",
    "indeed , the dust opacity largely dominates that of the gas , except in particular lines of molecular gas , which are more difficult to detect than dust thermal emission .",
    "therefore , most images of disks trace the spatial distribution of dust , not that of the gas . both components are often assumed to be well mixed , with a uniform gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 , but , as discussed in sect .",

    "this velocity difference gives rise to aerodynamic drag , which slows down the dust and makes it migrate radially towards the central star . in the vertical direction , drag makes the dust settle towards the midplane .",

    "it is for the median sizes ( 100  @xmath2m10  cm ) that all the interesting dynamics happens and the gas drag has a strong influence on the resulting distributions , showing important vertical settling in the inner regions and depletion in the outer disk due to inwards radial migration , with varying strength depending on grain size .",
    "we would like to point out that the efficiency of both processes depends not only on grain size but also on the nebula parameters , via the densities .",

    "it can produce synthetic scattered light images , as well as spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and polarization maps .",
    "we found that dust settling and migration cause wavelength variations of the disk apparent size and of the dark lane width , in agreement with observations .",
    "they also affect seds , causing a change of slope between 10 and 200  @xmath2 m . however , these effects are small , and a single observation would not give strong indications on the amount of settling .",
    "it is with a combination of multi - wavelength , multi - technique observations that one can hope to efficiently constrain the dust distribution .",
    "this is beautifully illustrated in the case of gg  tau .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figggtau ] shows three scattered light images of its circumbinary ring observed in the i , h , and l bands .",
    "the middle panel displays the corresponding synthetic images for three models without dust settling , therefore with gas and dust well mixed in the disk , for which the dust size distribution ( with the same slope as that of the interstellar medium ) , is truncated at a maximum size of 0.3 , 0.5 and 1.5  @xmath2 m , from left to right .",
    "no single model is able to simultaneously reproduce the observations in all three bands , and in particular the contrast between the front and back sides of the ring , but each one seems appropriate for a single band .",
    "this points towards a variation of the dust size distribution with depth in the disk .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figggtau ] shows synthetic images produced from new hydrodynamical simulations of gg  tau s circumbinary ring including dust settling and migration . without any fit to the data , the agreement with observations is now much better , showing that dust had indeed settled in this ring .",

    "the remaining discrepancies are likely due to missing physics in our simulations , among which grain growth .",
    "in a disk containing a planet , gravitational perturbations of the planet cause density waves , leading to an exchange of angular momentum with the disk .",
    "the planet pushes the disk exterior ( resp .",
    "interior ) to its orbit further out ( resp . in ) , therefore opening a gap .",
    "the gap is sustained if there is an equilibrium between tidal torques , acting to clear the gap , and viscous torques , acting to fill it .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( maddison  2007 ; fouchet 2007 ) ) . additionally , the structures caused in the dust phase depend strongly on the grain size , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figgapsize ] , due to varying drag and radial drift velocity throughout the disk .",
    "gaps are more prominent as the planet mass increases .",
    "since they are also much deeper in the dust than in the gas , much lighter planets are needed to open one in the dust phase , the one visible in most disk observations , than in the gas phase . in our mmsn models , we found that a 0.2  @xmath4 planet can open a gap in the dust layer while only a small surface density dip is observed in the gas ( see fig .",

    "lighter planets down to 0.05  @xmath4 create density dips in the dust , with steep gradients on both sides that should be visible by alma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( varnire 2006 ) ) .",
    "this suggests that planet gaps will be much easier to detect , with a lower threshold on planet mass , than previously anticipated .    since the influences of grain size , affecting the disk thickness and radial profile ( fig .",
    "[ figgapsize ] ) and of planet mass , affecting the gap structure ( fig .  [ figgapsigma ] ) are different ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fouchet  2007 ) for more detail ) , future observations of planet gaps will therefore allow to constrain the dust grain size distribution in addition to the planet mass .",
    "gaps can even play a role in planet formation .",
    "because of a very efficient vertical settling , the volume density of the dust reaches that of the gas in several regions of the disk , and even exceeds it at the gap inner edge ( see fig .  [ figgaprho ] ) .",
    "this affects the dynamics in that region and can favour planetesimal growth , ultimately leading to the formation of a second planet in the vicinity of the first one .",

    "our results demonstrate that , with or without an embedded planet , gas and dust are not well mixed in protoplanetary disks .",
    "the density enhancements we find in the dust component shape their observed images , and help solid particles to aggregate .    similarly to our work on gg  tau , we have started to compute synthetic images of disks with gaps in order to make better quantitative predictions of what alma will be able to detect .",
    "gas dispersal , not taken into account here , can lower the drag force and alter the dust distribution , and should be considered when interpreting observations .",
    "now that we have implemented in our code a mechanism to treat grain growth , we are working on an improved and more realistic physical model , taking into account detailed microscopic processes , as well as shattering , which produces small grains via collisional cascade .",
