    "manipulating the spin degree of freedom for electrons has recently brought in an emerging information technology , spintronics  @xcite , which offers novel clues for designing devices based on traditional materials with spin - related effects . in this promising field ,",
    "the spin hall effect  @xcite is regarded as a candidate method to inject spin current in semiconductors .",
    "based on the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , an external electric field is required to drive a transverse spin current while the magnetic field is not necessary , which is much different from the traditional applications of the spin degree of freedom . a universal spin hall conductivity @xmath0 is predicted theoretically in a clean single layer electron system  @xcite .",
    "several groups calculations  @xcite showed that nonmagnetic impurities would suppress this spin hall conductivity to zero while others indicated that the spin hall conductivity is not zero in the presence of magnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the spin accumulation in nonmagnetic semiconductors has been observed  @xcite and the spin current was detected either by kerr rotation microscopy  @xcite or by two - color optical coherence control techniques  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a direct electronic measurement of the spin hall effect has been reported  @xcite where the spin current induces the charge imbalance and a voltage is detected .    as the soc , which is crucial to the spin hall effect , is a relativistic effect and thus comparably weak ,",
    "a natural question is how to strengthen this effect . in the light of single layer systems being considered in current literature",
    ", one may ask whether a multi - layer system possesses a magnification effect and what new phenomena will take place if the tunnelling between layers is taken into account .",
    "another more realistic question is what will happen if there exist impurities in a multi - layer system .    in this paper , we investigate the spin transport properties in a coupled bilayer electron system with different soc strengthes in each layer as well as the tunnelling between layers . as a starting point , we generalize the definitions of spin currents to a coupled bilayer system and obtain the corresponding `` continuity - like '' equations .",
    "carrying out calculations of the spin current in the heisenberg representation , we find that the spin hall conductivity in each layer manifests abrupt enhancement around a particular value of the tunnelling strength between layers and undergoes a sign change across this point .",
    "the influence of impurities is also studied .",
    "we indicate that the spin hall conductivity in the bilayer system can not be suppressed to zero by an arbitrarily small concentration of impurities .",
    "an experimental scheme is designed on the basis of these features to magnify the spin hall effect near the turning point .",
    "besides , possible logical gates are expected to be elaborated based on the sign change of the spin current across this point .    the whole paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "although the impurities tend to suppress the spin hall conductivity , @xmath171 would still be detectable .",
    "for a two - dimensional electron gas with its mobility of order @xmath180 which is in an experimentally realizable regime , the peak value of @xmath171 is around @xmath0 .",
    "thus the spin hall conductivity for a bilayer electron system does not vanish and is expected to be measured in samples with high mobility .",
    "we discuss possible experiments to detect the magnification of the spin hall effect .",
    "our proposal is based on the fact that a spin - polarized electric current ( means the existence of spin current ) in the presence of the soc can induce different charge populations at the laterals and hence a hall voltage can be detected  @xcite . since the induced hall voltage is in proportional to the spin hall conductivity , its magnitude is greatly enhanced near the turning point @xmath101 in the coupled bilayer electron gas . as the tunnelling strength can be tuned by the gate voltage , we therefore suggest experimentally detect an enormously magnified hall voltage by tuning the tunnelling strength to be near @xmath101 in the bilayer system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : illu ] ) . additionally , the sign changes of spin hall conductivity across @xmath101 also make the coupled bilayer system a candidate for fabricating possible logical gates .",
    "we investigated the properties of the spin transport in a coupled bilayer system where the strength of the soc in each layer may be different and the tunnelling between the two layers occurs .",
    "we gave natural definitions of the spin density and the spin current density in each layer and derived the corresponding `` continuity - like '' equations .",
    "based on the calculations in heisenberg representation , we obtained the spin current .",
    "the curves of the spin hall conductivities in each layer exhibit sharp cusps around the turning point and the peak values have signs changed across this point .",
    "we also investigated the influence of impurities on the spin hall conductivity .",
    "we found that an arbitrarily small concentration of nonmagnetic impurities do not suppress the spin hall conductivity to zero in a bilayer system , which is quite different from the case in the single layer system .",
    "the opposite signs of the conductivities in the absence of impurities become the same in presence of impurities . making use of these features",
    ", we proposed a possible experiment to detect a magnified spin hall effect by direct electronic measurement .",
