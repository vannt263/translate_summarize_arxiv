    "in the process known as internal diffusion limited aggregation ( idla ) one constructs for each integer time @xmath8 an * occupied set * @xmath9 as follows : begin with @xmath10 , and for each @xmath0 let @xmath11 be @xmath2 plus the first point at which a simple random walk from the origin hits @xmath12 .",
    "idla was first proposed by meakin and deutch @xcite as a model of industrial chemical processes such as electropolishing , corrosion and etching . after discussing these applications",
    ", they write `` it is also of some fundamental significance to know just how smooth a surface formed by diffusion limited processes may be . ''",
    "their numerical findings indicated that such surfaces are astonishingly smooth : in two and higher dimensions , the fluctuations appeared to be at most logarithmic in the number of particles . in the more than two decades since , this finding has resisted mathematical proof .",

    "lawler , bramson and griffeath  @xcite proved that the asymptotic shape of the domain @xmath2 is a disk , and lawler  @xcite showed that the fluctuations from circularity are at most of order @xmath14 up to logarithmic factors , where @xmath4 is the radius of the disk of area  @xmath0 . later work @xcite related internal dla with multiple sources to variational problems in pde .",
    "however , the basic issue raised by meakin and deutch and again by lawler ( `` a more interesting question ... is whether the errors are @xmath15 for some @xmath16 . ''",
    "@xcite ) stood until asselah and gaudillire  @xcite ( with an appendix by blachre ) improved the bound of @xmath14 in dimensions @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "our main result shows that in dimension @xmath19 , the fluctuations from circularity are at most order @xmath20 .",
    "in fact we show somewhat more , namely that the probability that the fluctuations at time @xmath21 exceed @xmath22 decays like @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 can taken to be arbitrarily large , but the constant @xmath25 may depend on @xmath24 ) .",

    "taking @xmath39 for large enough @xmath24 , theorem  [ thm : logfluctuations ] in particular implies ( by borel - cantelli ) that the fluctuations from circularity are @xmath40 almost surely : @xmath41    this is the first part of a three part article . in the second part , entitled _ internal dla in higher dimensions _",

    "while both this paper and the sequel address fluctuations of idla , the results are of a rather different nature : the present paper is concerned with fluctuations at the fine scale of individual lattice points .",
    "the sequel addresses average fluctuations , and will show that in a certain sense the fluctuation from circularity _ averaged _ over a constant fraction of the boundary ( here inner and outer fluctuations cancel each other out ) is only _ constant _ order .",

    "these three sections comprise the background results needed for our argument .    in order to control more precisely the deviation from circularity near a point @xmath51",
    ", we define in section  [ sec : hzetaproperties ] a discrete harmonic function @xmath52 which approximates the harmonic function @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are viewed as complex variables .",

    "we may extend the function @xmath56 linearly to the grid  @xmath59 of horizontal and vertical line segments joining vertices of @xmath13 . if we begin with a collection of particles on the grid  @xmath59 , and we allow some of them to move according to brownian motions on  @xmath59 ( see section  [ sec : martingale ] ) , according to determined starting and stopping rules , then the sum of  @xmath56 over these particle locations is a continuous martingale ( provided that no particle continues to move after reaching a point where discrete harmonicity fails ) .",

    "* theorem  v.1.6 ) ) , we can represent any continuous martingale as a time change of a standard brownian motion .",
    "using the representation theorem and large deviations for brownian exit times , we can control the likelihood that this martingale is larger or smaller than its mean by estimating its quadratic variation .",
    "we will ultimately show that large deviations of @xmath2 from circularity are unlikely without large deviations of the martingale for some @xmath55 .",
    "for example , the fact that thin tentacles are unlikely ( lemma  [ lem : thickening ] ) means that with high probability , a point near some  @xmath55 can not belong to @xmath2 unless many points near  @xmath55 belong to @xmath2 . since @xmath64 is large for  @xmath54 close to  @xmath55 , this can be used to show that ( when @xmath55 is outside the typical range of @xmath2 ) the martingale is likely to be large if a point near @xmath55 belongs to @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , we can show that if @xmath55 fails to be hit ( long after we expect it to have been hit ) then the martingale has to be small at that time .",
    "( for this step we actually use a modified version of the process in which particles are frozen when they first exit a set called @xmath65 that approximates @xmath58 , see figure [ fig : hzeta ] . )    the martingale is a brownian motion parameterized by its quadratic variation time , but the amount of quadratic variation time elapsed while @xmath2 is constructed is random . note that the conditional expected amount of time elapsed when depositing one particle ( given the locations of all previous particles ) is the conditional variance of the value of @xmath56 at the position that the particle is deposited .",
    "this value is easy to approximate on the event that @xmath2 is approximately circular .",
    "if , as a heuristic , we _ assume _ that @xmath2 is approximately circular for all @xmath0 , then a back of the envelope calculation shows that the total time lapse in constructing @xmath66 should be of order @xmath67 in dimension two ( and of constant order in all higher dimensions ) . on the event that the total time lapse is about right ,",
    "the probability of having a martingale fluctuation of @xmath68 standard deviations should decay like @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath5 is large enough then we should be able to sum over all @xmath55 and show that we are unlikely to see fluctuations of this magnitude anywhere .",
    "this heuristic actually suggests the basic strategy of our argument : we assume some amount of regularity for the growth of @xmath2 and use that assumption to show that the quadratic variation time lapse is unlikely to be large , hence large martingale fluctuations are unlikely , and hence the growth of @xmath2 is _ even more regular _ than we assumed .",
    "this strategy is pursued in sections  [ sec : earlyimplieslate ] and  [ sec : lateimpliesearly ] , which contain the heart of proof . using the ideas above",
    ", we will show that the presence of an `` early point '' ( a point @xmath54 visited at time less than @xmath70 ) implies , with high probability , the presence of a comparably late point at a previous time ( lemma  [ lem : earlyimplieslate ] ) ; similarly , the presence of a late point implies , with high probability , the presence of a _ significantly earlier _ point at a previous time ( lemma  [ lem : lateimpliesearly ] ) . by iterating these two lemmas",
    ", we will see that if there were a substantial probability to have even a slightly early or late point ( off by more than @xmath71 ) , then there would be a substantial probability of having a much larger fluctuation , which would contradict our a priori estimate .",

    "the following lemma is a variant of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.12 ) .",
