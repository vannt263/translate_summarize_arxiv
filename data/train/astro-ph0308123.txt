    "stars form in dense interstellar regions known as molecular clouds , and particularly in the densest cores of molecular clouds .",
    "a great deal of observational work on molecular cloud cores has been carried out and a large number of sites of star formation have been observed in various molecular transitions ( e.g. myers , linke & benson 1983 ; myers & benson 1983 ; benson & myers 1989 ) .",
    "the chief transitions used tend to be various isotopes of co ( a tracer of column density ) and nh@xmath1 ( a tracer of volume density ) . a recent paper ( jijina , myers & adams 1999 ) cataloged all of the known molecular observations of a large sample of nearby star - forming regions , listing many of their physical properties such as density , temperature , size and shape .",
    "such a catalogue provides a wealth of detailed information about the star formation process . in this letter",
    "we concentrate on what we can learn from this catalogue about the shapes of star - forming cores .",
    "when observing molecular cloud cores , all we see are their projected shapes on the sky , whilst for detailed comparison with theory we would like information on their three dimensional shapes .",
    "jijina et al .",
    "( 1999 ) used their molecular - line maps of molecular cores and estimated the projected axial ratios ( @xmath2 ) by fitting elliptical envelopes to the data . here",
    "we analyze the resulting distribution of projected axial ratios , on the assumption that molecular cores are ellipsoidal , with a well - defined distribution of intrinsic axial ratios ( @xmath3 ) , and that the cores in the jijina et al .",
    "sample are randomly oriented .",
    "our aim is to constrain the distribution of intrinsic three - dimensional axial ratios .",
    "a triaxial object , when viewed from any angle , appears in projection as an ellipse .",
    "binney ( 1985 ) calculated the projected axial ratio @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) for an ellipsoid having axial ratios @xmath3 ( where @xmath5 ) and viewed from an angle @xmath6 as    @xmath7}}{a + c + \\sqrt{[(a - c)^2   + b^2 ] } } } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of the intrinsic axial ratios and the viewing angles given by    @xmath11 +   \\frac{{\\rm sin}^2(\\theta)}{\\zeta^2 } , \\ ] ]    @xmath12 \\frac{1}{\\eta^2}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath13 \\frac{1}{\\eta^2 } .\\ ] ]    the simplest statistical approach to take in determining whether a given distribution of projected axial ratios ( @xmath2 ) is drawn from a single distribution of intrinsic axial ratios ( @xmath14 ) , is to use an assumed distribution of @xmath15- and @xmath16-values to generate a large number ( more than @xmath17 ) of projected @xmath2-values in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "these monte carlo @xmath2-values can be converted into a distribution function , and this ` artificial ' distribution function can then be compared with the ` real ' ( i.e. observed ) distribution function from the jijina et al .",
    "data set . the ks - test and @xmath18",
    "test can be used to evaluate the likelihood of the assumed fit .    following jones , basu & dubinski ( 2001 )",
    ", we assume that the axial ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 have gaussian distributions characterized by means ( @xmath19 ) and standard deviations ( @xmath20 ) , with the additional constraint that @xmath15 and @xmath16 must fall in the interval from 0 to 1 .",
    "we find that the best fit to the observed @xmath2-values of the entire jijina et al .",
    "( 1999 ) sample is obtained with @xmath21,@xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it has @xmath18 probability of 0.74 .",
    "in contrast , jones et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find @xmath25,@xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this difference is significant at the high ellipticity end of the distribution ( but not in the heart of the distribution as both are good fits to the data ) . to test this",
    "@xmath17 ellipticities were drawn from both our best fit and that of jones et al . and",
    "the ks test rejects the two distributions as being the same at very high probability ( @xmath28 per cent ) .",
    "the rejection is at even higher significance for less than @xmath17 samples .",
    "the reason why our analysis rejects the jones et al .",
    "( 2001 ) best fit is that the smallest observed axial ratio @xmath29 requires the combination of an extremely small short axis ( @xmath30 below @xmath31 ) and a viewing direction within a few degrees of the mid - axis .",
    "this is extremely unlikely .",
    "moreover it should be noted that the @xmath29 core is not a lone outlier ; there are four cores with @xmath32 .",
    "jijina et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find significant differences in many of the cores properties between starless cores ( ones with no associated iras source ) and protostellar cores ( ones with at least one associated iras source ) .",
    "they also find significant differences between cores which are associated with star clusters and those which are not .",
    "we therefore repeated our analysis for these subsamples .",
    "association with a star cluster does not appear to affect the distribution of intrinsic axial ratios .",
    "however , there does appear to be a statistically significant difference between starless cores and protostellar cores .",
    "there are 79 starless cores and 179 protostellar cores in the sample , excluding cores defined by jijina et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as being multiples , due to the difficulties of correctly determining the projected axial ratios of such cores .",
    "figure 1 shows the best fit for starless cores , obtained with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "this fit maximises the ks probability at 0.46 ( with a @xmath18 probability of @xmath37 ) , a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "figure 2 shows the best fit for the protostellar cores , obtained with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath38 , and @xmath36 .",
    "this fit has a ks probability of only 0.01 ( but a @xmath18 probability of @xmath39 ) . whilst this is the best fit it appears that a distribution formed so simply is not good at representing the observed distribution .",
    "the results are summarised in table 1 .",
    "figure 3 demonstrates the fact that starless and protostellar cores have significantly different distributions , by comparing their cumulative distribution functions with our average fit obtained using @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath40 , and @xmath36 .",
    "evidently neither data set is matched especially well by this average fit .",
    "instead , the average fit lies comfortably between the two cumulative distributions , with the majority of starless cores lying above the average fit , and the majority of protostellar cores lying below it .",
    "this difference is significant as the ks test shows that starless and protostellar cores only have a 5 per cent probability of being drawn from the same distribution .    to test whether the apparent difference between starless cores and protostellar cores is due to selection effects",
    ", we examined whether @xmath2 correlates with properties such as the linear size and density of a core . in the jijina et al .",
    "data set , the protostellar cores are generally larger than the starless cores .",
    "we believe this to be a selection effect , since a protostellar core is on average hotter and more luminous than a starless core of the same mass , and therefore the outer parts of its envelope are more readily detected .",
    "however @xmath2 is uncorrelated with other properties ( in particular linear size ) and so we do not believe that selection effects are biasing our results significantly .",
    "if selection effects can not explain our result , then it is surprising . as explained by zeldovich ( 1970 ) , and verified by many others since",
    ", one would expect a dynamically collapsing triaxial ellipsoid to collapse faster along its shortest axis than along the other axes .",
    "consequently , more evolved cores ( those with protostars ) might be expected to have more extreme axial ratios than less evolved ones ( starless cores ) , which is the opposite of our result .",
    "one possible explanation is that the collapse of cores with significant magnetic fields is not as simple as a pure gravitational collapse and may cause the effect we observe ( eg .",
    "habe et al .",
    "another possibility is that the outer envelopes of protostellar cores are not collapsing and have greater _ isotropic _ support than those of starless cores .",
    "for instance , they could have higher turbulence , as inferred from the broader line - widths observed by beichman et al .",
    "we are currently undertaking a programme of simulations of the collapse of triaxial cores , which may shed light on the evolution of the axial ratios .",
    ".the best fit triaxialities for mid- and short - axes for the starless and protostellar cores . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : data ]",
    "we have shown that the projected axial ratios of molecular cores ( jijina et al .",
    "1999 ) can be well fitted with randomly oriented ellipsoids having their intrinsic axial ratios distributed according to @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this conclusion is different to that of jones et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in that they infer less extreme axial ratios .",
    "the reason for this is that they allow distributions which ( in effect ) predict no low @xmath2-values even though several are observed .",
    "when we divide the jijina et al .",
    "( 1999 ) data into subsamples and repeat our analysis we find a difference between starless cores and protostellar cores , in the sense that starless cores are flatter .",
    "specifically , starless cores are best fit with @xmath44 , while protostellar cores are best fit with @xmath45 .",
    "this result is surprising .",
    "a triaxial ellipsoid in free - fall should collapse faster along its shortest axis than along the other axes .",
    "hence older cores ( those with protostars ) might be expected to have more extreme axial ratios .",
    "it appears that the opposite is the case .",
