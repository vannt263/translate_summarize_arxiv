    "this paper generalizes the following idea of a tchebyshev triangulation introduced in  @xcite : given any simplicial complex @xmath3 , subdivide each edge into two parts by adding a new midpoint , and triangulate @xmath3 by performing a stellar subdivision at each of the newly added midpoints .",
    "the order in which these subdivisions had to be performed was subject to certain rules , and then the face numbers of the resulting complex @xmath4 were always the same .",
    "the effect of this triangulation operation on the face numbers @xmath5 is most easily described in terms of the _",
    "@xmath7 of these complexes : the operation taking the @xmath6-polynomial of @xmath3 into the @xmath6-polynomial of @xmath4 is an instance of the linear map @xmath8\\rightarrow { \\mathbb r}[x]$ ] that takes each @xmath9 to @xmath10 , the @xmath11 tchebyshev polynomial of the first kind .    a key result of the present paper , theorem  [ thm : samef ] , is a wide - reaching generalization of the idea presented above . it states that the stellar subdivision operations above may be performed in any order , and we always obtain the same face numbers .",
    "furthermore , the statement may be generalized to the situation where instead of subdividing each edge into two parts , we subdivide each @xmath1-dimensional face in the same way , using a fixed triangulation @xmath0 of the @xmath1-simplex that adds new vertices only in the interior . the resulting _",
    "generalized tchebyshev triangulations _ are the subject of study of our present paper .    as we will see in section  [ sec : genf ] , the face numbers in a generalized tchebyshev triangulation can be easily computed knowing the number of faces of @xmath0 with given numbers of vertices on the boundary and in the interior of the @xmath1-simplex . at the level of the @xmath6-polynomials ,",
    "each fixed subdivision @xmath0 induces a linear map @xmath12\\rightarrow { \\mathbb r}[x]$ ] , giving rise to a natural generalization of tchebyshev polynomials of the first kind , introduced in section  [ sec : tl ] .",
    "these polynomials share many properties with the ordinary tchebyshev polynomials : they satisfy a fibonacci - type recurrence ( whose degree depends on the dimension @xmath1 ) , their multiset of zeros is symmetric to the origin , and all their real zeros belong to the interval @xmath2 .",
    "the question naturally arises , whether these generalized tchebyshev polynomials of the first kind also have only real roots .",
    "a first answer to this question is given in section  [ sec : rr ] , where we will see that the answer is always `` yes '' for @xmath13 , and it is `` no '' for the simplest subdivision of a @xmath14-simplex , obtained by adding one new vertex in the interior and performing a stellar subdivision . in section  [ sec:2dim ] we prove that all roots are real also for generalized tchebyshev polynomials of the first kind , induced by any valid subdivision of the two - dimensional simplex .",
    "generalizing the construction introduced in @xcite , in section  [ sec : higher ] we introduce analogues of tchebyshev polynomials of the second kind , by considering summing over the links of all faces of a given dimension of the original complex , in the subdivided complex .",
    "a lot remains to be explored regarding these polynomials , but a few results indicate that we have found an `` appropriate generalization '' : our generalized tchebyshev polynomials of the @xmath15 kind ( where @xmath16 ) satisfy the same recurrence as our generalized tchebyshev polynomials of the first kind , the multisets of their roots are also symmetric of the origin , and their real roots also belong to the interval @xmath2 .",
    "we chose to postpone a deeper study of their real - rootedness to a future occasion , but we established the fact that , for @xmath13 , all generalized tchebyshev polynomials of the second kind are real rooted .    our results in sections  [ sec : tl ] and [ sec : higher ] underline the central importance of the generalized tchebyshev triangulations of the boundary complex of a crosspolytope , as the coefficients of our generalized tchebyshev polynomials can be directly read off the face count in these complexes , refined by distinguishing between original and newly added vertices . in the concluding section  [ sec : glbf ]",
    "we prove the validity of a conjecture by the second author  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 1.5 ) , on strong generalized lower bounds for the face numbers of some of these simplicial complexes .",
    "our generalized tchebyshev triangulations offer infinitely many new ways to subdivide a simplicial complex in such a manner that the face numbers change in a predictable fashion . in this sense",
    "our triangulation operations generalize the notion of a barycentric subdivision .",
    "in fact , any barycentric subdivision arises by applying a sequence of generalized tchebyshev triangulation operations as follows : for each @xmath1 that is less than or equal to the dimension of the complex to be subdivided , we take the generalized tchebyshev triangulation induced by the stellar subdivision of a @xmath1-simplex obtained after adding a single vertex in its interior ( we perform these operation in decreasing order by @xmath1 ) . investigating whether some face counting polynomial associated to such a triangulation has only real roots is not a new concern : brenti and welker  @xcite showed that the @xmath17-polynomial of the barycentric subdivision of a simplicial complex with a nonnegative @xmath17-vector has only simple real zeros . in the future , it would be worth finding an exact description of all triangulations of a @xmath1-simplex that induces generalized tchebyshev polynomials having only real roots . another interesting question is to fix a specific generalized tchebyshev triangulation operation , and to ask : to which simplicial complexes",
    "can we apply them and obtain real - rooted @xmath18-polynomials and/or @xmath17-polynomials ? finally , once we have a better understanding of the generalized tchebyshev polynomials of the higher kind , it will be worth finding out how they are interconnected .",
