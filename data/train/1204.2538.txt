    "the spin - boson model@xcite ( sbm ) represents one of the most well - established frameworks for describing the effect of dissipation on a quantum system . in its simplest incarnation ,",
    "it describes a two - level system coupled to an infinite number of harmonic oscillators with low - frequency spectral density @xmath23 , with ohmic damping ( @xmath9 ) being the most commonly studied case .",
    "generalizations of this model include extensions to finite ( spatial ) dimensions @xmath24,@xcite and models where the @xmath25 ( ising ) spin symmetry has been replaced by a higher symmetry.@xcite extended versions of such systems may also find applications in the study of quantum critical points in quantum magnets and strongly correlated systems,@xcite and hence they are of considerable interest in contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "another generalization is to consider non - ohmic spectral densities ( @xmath26 ) , which may be relevant in the description of several different physical phenomena.@xcite from a more fundamental physics point of view , the sub - ohmic ( @xmath27 ) sbm and related models have been studied intensively in recent years@xcite following claims that the so - called quantum - to - classical mapping may be violated in even the simplest variant of sbm for @xmath28.@xcite its super - ohmic counterpart @xmath29 has , on the other hand , received relatively little attention",
    ". this may be due to the fact that the ( 0 + 1)-dimensional [ ( 0 + 1)d ] sbm exhibits a ( quantum ) phase transition only for values of @xmath30 . for @xmath31",
    ", however , the possibility of a phase transition arises for all @xmath2 .",
    "the sbm is generally described , via the quantum - to - classical mapping , by a classical ( @xmath5 + 1)d spin model with long - range interactions that decay as @xmath32 in imaginary time @xmath33 .",
    "long - range interactions are interesting , as they allow one to increase the effective dimensionality continuously by tuning @xmath2 to lower values . in classical spin glasses , for instance , low - dimensional models with long - range interactions have been studied to infer properties of higher - dimensional realizations of the same systems with purely short - range interactions.@xcite in quantum models , the effective dimensionality is expressed by @xmath34 , with @xmath4 being the dynamical critical exponent defined from the divergence of the correlation time @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the spatial correlation length . at a second - order phase transition , we have in standard notation @xmath37 as the coupling parameter @xmath38 approaches its critical value @xmath39 .",
    "the presence of dissipation in general causes @xmath4 to deviate from the value @xmath10 , with a naive scaling estimate @xmath40.@xcite although this result is exact in mean - field theory ( @xmath41 ) , deviations may appear when decreasing @xmath42 .",

    "one issue we address in this paper is how the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath7 evolve as one varies the dissipation parameter @xmath49 . for the ohmic case considered previously ,",
    "the deviations from naive scaling ( i.e. , from @xmath50 ) are barely significant due to the small value of @xmath7 when @xmath14 .",
    "this deviation should become more noticeable as the effective dimensionality decreases , although one can not expect the relation @xmath43 , valid for @xmath9 , to hold also for larger @xmath2 . in the limit @xmath51 , the anomalous dimension",
    "might be expected to approach the relatively large value @xmath13 , which it takes for both the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising and 2d @xmath15 model .",
    "a related issue is the value of @xmath2 beyond which the dissipation term is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , giving @xmath10 .",
    "naive scaling indicates that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , but as @xmath4 is likely to decrease faster than @xmath54 as @xmath2 increases , dissipation might turn irrelevant for a value of @xmath2 smaller than 2 .",
    "another issue which we address is how the critical exponents , in particular @xmath4 and @xmath7 , depend on the symmetry of the order parameter . in the limit @xmath9 , there is no significant difference between the values of @xmath7 ( and thereby @xmath4 ) for discrete and continuous order parameter fields , @xcite but it is not inconceivable that such a difference becomes noticeable for lower effective dimensions , that is , as @xmath2 is increased .    in order to answer these questions and to study a class of dissipative models for which relatively little is known precisely , we present results from monte carlo simulations on both @xmath15 and ising - like spin chains with non - ohmic dissipation . in both cases ,",
    "we consider super - ohmic dissipation , which for the @xmath15 case allows us to interpolate between the universality class describing the three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath15 model and the very different berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) criticality of the 2d @xmath15 model .",
    "the models are presented in the next section , where we also describe the finite - size scaling procedure used to find the critical exponents .",

    "we consider two possible domains of the angle variables : @xmath6 symmetry is equivalent with @xmath66 , and for a discrete symmetry ( @xmath67 ) , we choose to enforce the restriction @xmath68 .",

    "this equivalence is easily shown using the substitution @xmath69 and @xmath70 to rewrite the action as that of two ising models in terms of decoupled ising spins @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

    "when determining critical exponents of a quantum system using finite - size scaling ( fss ) , the system dimensions @xmath74 , @xmath75 used have to be chosen such that they respect the system anisotropy reflected by the dynamical critical exponent , @xmath76 .",

    "furthermore , we are also able to appropriately take the uncertainty in @xmath4 into account when finding the uncertainty in the other exponents , by repeating the entire procedure for a number of jackknife bins based on the original data .    the procedure to find @xmath4 is explained in more detail in , for example , ref .  , and is based on the binder ratio @xmath81 where brackets @xmath82 indicate ensemble averages and @xmath83 is a universal scaling function .",

    "@xmath91 , we use the usual fss forms for the magnetization @xmath92 and the magnetic susceptibility @xmath93 respectively . the anomalous dimension @xmath7",
    "is then found from the scaling relation @xmath94 .",
    "we have also checked that the value of @xmath7 obtained from the susceptibility data is in correspondence with that obtained ( through @xmath95 ) from the critical two - point correlation function of the order parameter field , @xmath96 .",
    "all of the above observables are evaluated at @xmath97 , and we are careful to only use system sizes @xmath75 relatively close to @xmath79 in the interpolation . using a polynomial fit of as low order as 3 works very well in most cases , although more care must be taken when extracting @xmath86 .",
    "the error estimates we report are jackknife estimates of statistical errors only , but include contributions from the uncertainty in @xmath79 and the critical coupling @xmath39 .",

    "possible corrections to scaling are discussed below .",
    "we note in particular that we initially assume a second - order phase transition for all values of @xmath2 we use , so critical exponents obtained in the case of a bkt transition should be regarded as effective exponents only . the special case of @xmath101 for the @xmath15 model is therefore re - examined separately in sec .

    "there is good reason to expect that the same also holds in the sub - ohmic regime @xmath200 .",
    "such values of @xmath2 increase the effective dimensionality beyond 3 , eventually driving all exponents to their universal mean - field values at the upper critical dimension .",
    "we next comment on other values of @xmath201 , and how our results apply to those cases .",
    "the ising and @xmath15 models represent extreme cases of @xmath21 clock models , with @xmath202 , @xmath203 , respectively .",
    "the partition function for the @xmath204 case is simply the square of the case @xmath202 , and hence they give identical results . for larger @xmath205 , anisotropy is irrelevant , @xcite and we thus expect the results of @xmath6 to emerge .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the results of this paper for @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , are valid for all @xmath21 clock models .",
    "the only possible exception is the case @xmath206 , also equivalent to the three - state potts model , where the anisotropy with respect to a u(1)-symmetric model is known to be relevant .",
    "although we have not checked this , it may still be possible that eq .",
    "holds also for a dissipative @xmath207 clock model , at least for @xmath29.@xcite    an alternative perspective on this , supporting the notion that the scaling relation @xmath208 is valid for all @xmath201 , may be provided by the following qualitative argument .",
    "the variation of @xmath4 with the parameter @xmath2 determining the range of the dissipation , expresses a variation in the effective space - time dimensionality of the system .",
    "this is determined by the interaction of the spins at a given site in the imaginary - time direction .",
    "due to the long - range character of this interaction , each spin interacts with a large number of fluctuating copies of itself along a chain in the imaginary - time direction . due to the summation over many spins at different trotter slices ,",
    "the discrete nature of the spins in a @xmath21 clock model is washed out , even in the case @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , the manner in which the dissipation affects the effective dimensionality does not depend on whether the spins at each space - time lattice point take on discrete or continuous values .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations on a generalized spin - boson model in one spatial dimension featuring non - ohmic site dissipation and two variants of order parameter symmetry , namely ising - like and @xmath6 . by tuning the imaginary - time decay exponent of the dissipative interaction , @xmath209 $ ]",
    ", we are able to continuously vary the effective dimensionality of the system .",
    "apparently , the order parameter symmetry has very little bearing on the evolution of the effective dimensionality , @xmath210 , as a function of the decay parameter @xmath2 . while naive scaling estimates a crossover from criticality dominated by the dissipation term to an irrelevant dissipation term at @xmath11 , we measure exponents in relatively good correspondence with the underlying , short - range interacting model at a somewhat lower value @xmath211 . our results also suggest that for @xmath212 , the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath7 to a good approximation obey the scaling relation @xmath213 .",
