    "network science has grown explosively during the past two decades @xcite , and myriad new journal articles on network science appear every year .",
    "one focal area in the networks literature is the development and analysis of algorithms for detecting local , mesoscale , and global structures in various types of networks @xcite .",
    "mesoscale features are particularly interesting , as they arise neither at the local scale of vertices ( i.e. , nodes ) and edges nor at the global scale of summary statistics . in the present paper",
    ", we contribute to research on mesoscale network structures by developing and analyzing new ( and computationally - effecient ) algorithms for detecting a feature known as _ core ",
    "periphery structure _ , which consists of densely - connected _ core _ vertices and sparsely - connected _ peripheral _ vertices .",
    "the importance of the investigation of mesoscale network structures is widely acknowledged @xcite , but almost all of the research on this topic concerns a specific type of feature known as _ community structure_. in studying community structure , one typically employs some algorithm to detect sets of vertices called _ communities _ that consist of vertices that are densely connected to each other , such that the connection density between vertices from different communities is comparatively sparse @xcite",
    ". a diverse array of methods exist , and they have been applied to areas , such as committee networks in political science @xcite , friendship networks @xcite , protein ",
    "protein interaction networks @xcite , functional brain networks @xcite , and mobile phone networks @xcite .",
    "popular methods include the optmization of a quality function called `` modularity ''  @xcite , spectral partitioning  @xcite , dynamical approaches based on random walkers or other dynamical systems  @xcite , local methods such as @xmath0-clique percolation  @xcite , and more .",
    "most community - detection methods require a vertex to belong to a distinct community , but several methods also allow the detection of overlapping communities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "core  periphery structure is a mesoscale feature that is rather different from community structure .",
    "the main difference is that core vertices are well - connected to peripheral vertices , whereas the standard perspective on community structure views communities as nearly decomposable modules ( which leads to trying to find the best block - diagonal fit to a network s adjacency matrix ) @xcite .",
    "core  periphery structure and community structure are thus represented by different types of block models @xcite .",
    "the quantitative investigation of core  periphery structure has a reasonably long history @xcite , and qualitative notions of core  periphery structure have long been considered in fields such as international relations @xcite , sociology @xcite , and economics @xcite ( and have been examined more recently in applications such as neuroscience @xcite , transportation @xcite , and faculty movements in academia @xcite ) , but the study of core  periphery structure remains poorly developed  especially in comparison to the study of community structure @xcite .",
    "most investigations of core  periphery structure tend to use the perspective that a network s adjacency matrix has an intrinsic block structure ( which is different from the block structure from community structure )  @xcite .",
    "very recently , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite identified core  periphery structure by fitting a stochastic block model ( sbm ) to empirical network data using a maximum likelihood method , and the sbm approach in ref .",
    "@xcite can also be used to study core  periphery structure .",
    "importantly , it is possible to think of core  periphery structure using a wealth of different perspectives , such as overlapping communities  @xcite , @xmath0-cores  @xcite , network capacity  @xcite , and random walks  @xcite .",
    "the notion of `` nestedness '' @xcite from ecology is also related to core  periphery structure , although establishing an explicit and direct connection between these ideas appears to be an open problem .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is the development of novel algorithms for detecting core  periphery structure .",
    "our aim is to develop algorithms that are both computationally efficient and robust to high levels of noise in data , as such data can lead to a blurry separation between core vertices and peripheral vertices .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : coreperintro ] , we give an introduction to the notion of core  periphery structure and briefly survey a few of the existing methods to detect such structure . in section [ sec : pathcore ] , we introduce the path - core method , which is based on computing shortest paths between vertices of a network , for detecting core  periphery structure .",
    "in section [ sec : objfuncsync ] , we introduce an objective function for detecting core  periphery structure that leverages our proposed algorithms and helps in the classification of vertices into a core set and periphery set . in section [ sec : rank2 ] , we propose the spectral method lowrank - core , which detects core  periphery structure by considering the adjacency matrix of a network as a low - rank perturbation matrix . in section",
    "[ sec : laplacian ] , we investigate two laplacian - based methods ( lap - core and lapsgn - core ) for computing core  periphery structure in a network , and we discuss related work in community detection that uses a similar approach . in section [ sec : numsims ] , we compare the results of applying the above algorithms using several synthetically - generated networks and real - world networks . finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section [ sec : future ] , and we also discuss several open problems and potential applications . in appendix 1 , we detail the steps of our proposed path - core algorithm for computing the path - core scores , and we include an analysis of its computational complexity . in appendix 2 , we discuss the spectrum of the random - walk laplacian of a graph and ( of the random - walk laplacian of its complement ) . in appendix 3",
    ", we detail an experiment with artificially planted high - degree peripheral vertices that illustrates the sensitivity of a degree - based method ( which we call degree - core and which uses vertex degree as a proxy to measure coreness ) to such outlier vertices . finally ,",
    "in appendix 4 , we calculate spearman and pearson correlation coefficients between the coreness scores that we obtain from the different methods across several real - world networks .",
    "the best - known quantitative treatment of core  periphery structure was introduced by borgatti and everett @xcite , who developed algorithms for detecting discrete and continuous versions of core  periphery structure in weighted , undirected networks .",
    "( for the rest of the present paper , note that we will use the terms `` network '' and `` graph '' interchangeably . )",
    "their discrete methods start by comparing a network to an ideal block matrix in which the core is fully connected , the periphery has no internal edges , and the periphery is well - connected to the core .",
    "borgatti and everett s main algorithm for finding a discrete core  periphery structure assigns each vertex either to a single `` core '' set of vertices or to a single `` periphery '' set of vertices .",
    "one seeks a vector @xmath1 of length @xmath2 whose entries are either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , depending on whether or not the associated vertex has been assigned to the core ( @xmath3 ) or periphery ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we let @xmath5 if @xmath6 ( i.e. , vertex @xmath7 is assigned to the core ) or @xmath8 ( i.e. , vertex @xmath9 is assigned to the core ) , and we otherwise let @xmath10 ( because neither @xmath7 nor @xmath9 are assigned to the core ) . we define @xmath11 , where @xmath12 ( with elements @xmath13 ) is the adjacency matrix of the ( possibly weighted ) network @xmath14 . borgatti and everett s algorithm searches for a value of @xmath15 that is high compared to the expected value of @xmath16 if @xmath1 is shuffled such that the number of @xmath4 and @xmath3 entries is preserved but their order is randomized .",
    "the final output of the method is the vector @xmath1 that gives the highest @xmath17-score for @xmath15 . in a variant algorithm for detecting discrete core  periphery structure , borgatti and everett",
    "still let @xmath5 if both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are equal to @xmath3 and let @xmath20 if neither @xmath7 nor @xmath9 are assigned to the core , but they now let @xmath21 $ ] if either @xmath6 or @xmath8 ( but not both ) . to detect a continuous core  periphery structure @xcite , borgatti and everett assigned a vertex @xmath7 a core value of @xmath22 and",
    "let @xmath23 .",
    "a recent method that builds on the continuous notion of core  periphery structure from @xcite was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it calculates a core - score for weighted , undirected networks ; and it has been applied ( and compared to community structure ) in the investigation of functional brain networks  @xcite .",
    "the method of core  periphery detection in the popular network - analysis software ucinet @xcite uses the so - called _ minimum residual _ ( minres ) method @xcite , which is a technique for factor analysis .",
    "one uses factor analysis to describe observed correlations between variables in terms of a smaller number of unobserved variables called the `` factors '' @xcite .",
    "minres aims to find a vector @xmath24 that minimizes @xmath25 where @xmath26 for all vertices @xmath7 .",
    "one ignores the diagonal elements of the network s adjacency matrix .",
    "additionally , because @xmath27 is symmetric , this method works best for undirected networks @xmath14 . for directed networks",
    ", one can complement the results of minres with a method based on a singular value decomposition ( svd )  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "ucinet reports @xmath28 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , yang and leskovec argued that core  periphery structure can arise as a consequence of community structure with overlapping communities .",
    "they presented a so - called _ community - affiliation graph model _ to capture dense overlaps between communities . in their approach ,",
    "the likelihood that two vertices are adjacent to each other is proportional to the number of communities in which they have shared membership .",
    "della rossa et al .",
    "recently proposed a method for detecting a continuous core ",
    "periphery profile of a ( weighted ) network by studying the behavior of a random walker on a network @xcite .",
    "approaches based on random walks and other markov processes have often been employed in the investigation of community structure  @xcite , and it seems reasonable to examine them for other mesocale structures as well .",
    "very recently , ref .",
    "@xcite identified core  periphery structure by fitting a stochastic block model to empirical network data using a maximum likelihood method .",
    "the review article @xcite discusses several other methods to detect core  periphery structure in networks .",
    "in transportation systems , some locations and routes are much more important than others .",
    "this motivates the idea of developing notions of core  periphery structure that are based on transportation . in this section ,",
    "we restrict our attention to undirected and unweighted networks , although we have also examined transport - based core  periphery structure in empirical weighted and directed networks @xcite .    the first transport - based algorithm that we propose for detecting core  periphery structure",
    "is reminiscent of _ betweenness centrality _",
    "( bc ) in networks @xcite .",
    "one seeks to measure the extent to which a vertex controls information that flows through a network by counting the number of shortest paths ( i.e. , `` geodesic '' paths ) on which the vertex lies between pairs of other vertices in the network .",
    "geodesic vertex betweenness centrality is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of different shortest paths ( i.e. , the `` path count '' ) from vertex @xmath9 to vertex @xmath0 , and @xmath31 is the number of such paths that include vertex @xmath7 .",
    "our approach also develops a scoring methodology for vertices that is based on computing shortest paths in a network .",
    "such a score reflects the likelihood that a given vertex is part of a network s core .",
    "instead of considering shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a network , we consider shortest paths between pairs of vertices that share an edge _ when that edge is excluded from the network_. more precisely , we calculate @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined , respectively , as the path counts @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the graph @xmath35 , and @xmath36 denotes the edge set induced by the vertex set @xmath37 . the network @xmath35 denotes the subgraph of @xmath14 that one obtains by removing the edge @xmath38 .",
    "alternatively , one can define the path - core score of a vertex @xmath7 as the betweenness centrality of this vertex when considering paths only between pairs of adjacent vertices @xmath9 and @xmath0 , but for which the edge @xmath39 incident to the two vertices is discarded .",
    "in passing , we mention the approach by valente and fujimoto @xcite for deriving measures for `` bridging '' in networks based on the observation that edges that reduce distances in a network are important structural bridges . in their measure , for which they used a modification of closeness centrality , one systematically deletes edges and measures changes in the resulting mean path lengths . see also the recent paper @xcite about bridging centrality .    in section [ sec3.1 ]",
    ", we explain the intuition behind the proposed path - core algorithm , and we examine its performance on several synthetic networks . in section [ sec3.2 ] ,",
    "we comment on a randomized version of the path - core algorithm that samples a subset of edges in a graph and computes shortest paths only between the endpoints of the associated vertices .",
    "let @xmath40 be a graph with a vertex set @xmath41 of size @xmath2 ( i.e. , there are @xmath42 vertices ) and an edge set @xmath43 of size @xmath44 .",
    "the set of core vertices is @xmath45 ( and its size is @xmath46 ) for the size of the core set . ] , and the set of peripheral vertices is @xmath47 ( and its size is @xmath48 ) .",
    "suppose that a network ( i.e. , a graph ) contains exactly one core set and exactly one peripheral set , and that these sets are disjoint : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the goal of the path - core algorithm is to compute a score for each vertex in the graph @xmath14 that reflects the likelihood that that vertex belongs to the core . in other words ,",
    "high - scoring vertices have a high probability of being in the core , and low - scoring vertices have a high probability of being in the periphery . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the term `` path - core scores '' to indicate the scores that we associate with a network s vertices by using the path - core algorithm .",
    "we illustrate our methodology in the context of a generalized block model , such as the one in table [ tab : generalblockmodel ] , where the submatrices @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 represent the interactions between a pair of core vertices , a core vertex and a peripheral vertex , and a pair of peripheral vertices , respectively .",
    "suppose that @xmath51 and @xmath53 are adjacency matrices that we construct using the erds - rnyi random graph models on @xmath2 vertices , recall that an edge is present between each pair of vertices independently with probability @xmath54 .",
    "] @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , and that @xmath52is the adjacency matrix of a random bipartite graph @xmath57 in which each edge that is incident to both a core and peripheral vertex is present with independent probability @xmath58 . in the context of the above block model ,",
    "core  periphery structure arises naturally in instances of the above ensemble for which @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "the above family of random networks , which we denote by @xmath61 , was also considered in ref .",
    "it contains exactly one set of core vertices , and the remaining vertices are peripheral vertices .",
    "more complicated core  periphery structures can also occur @xcite , such as a mix of ( possibly hierarchical ) community structures and core  periphery structures ."
