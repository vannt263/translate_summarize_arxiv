    "investigations of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems have and will continue to play a central role in our quest to understand flavor physics  @xcite , but investigations of the charm - quark sector are fundamental too . since charm is the only _ up - type _",
    "quark for which the decay modes can be studied , it has a unique role to investigate flavor physics .",
    "charm allows a complementary probe of standard model beyond to that attainable from the _ down - type _ sector .",
    "here we present recent analyses on lifetimes and semileptonic decays .",
    "the e831-focus spectrometer is an upgraded version of the e687 fixed target spectrometer  @xcite , located in the fermilab proton beam area , which collected data during the 199697 fixed target run .",
    "electron and positron beams ( with typically @xmath3 endpoint energy ) obtained from the @xmath4 tevatron proton beam , produce by means of bremsstrahlung , a photon beam which interacts with a segmented beo target .",
    "the mean photon energy for triggered events is @xmath5 .",
    "two systems of silicon microvertex detectors are used to reconstruct vertices : the first system consists of 4 planes of microstrips interleaved with the experimental target  @xcite and the second system consists of 12 planes of microstrips located downstream of the target .",
    "these detectors provide high resolution in the transverse plane ( approximately @xmath6 ) , allowing the identification and separation of charm primary ( production ) and secondary ( decay ) vertices .",
    "more than 1 million charm particles have been fully reconstructed .",
    "the determination of lifetimes allows to convert the branching ratios measured by experiments to partial decay rates predicted by theory .",
    "focus is the only experiment ( with the predecessor experiment e687 ) to have measured the lifetimes of all the weakly decaying charmed particles .",
    "this is particulary important when one forms the ratio of lifetimes because most of the systematic errors cancel out . in fig",
    "[ fig : lifetime ] we show a comparison between the pdg 2002  @xcite values and the focus lifetime measurements ( in two cases our results are already included in the weighted averages ) .",
    "focus produced new lifetimes results with precision better than the previous world average .",
    "an accurate measurement of the @xmath7 lifetime for the golden decay mode into @xmath8 is a crucial ingredient to determine the lifetime difference , and consequently the parameter @xmath9 of the @xmath10 mixing .    to    the increasingly precise measurements of the heavy quark lifetimes have stimulated the further development of theoretical models , like the heavy quark theory  @xcite , which are able to predict successfully the rich pattern of charm hadron lifetimes , that span one order of magnitude from the longest lived ( @xmath11 ) to the shortest lived ( @xmath12 ) .    for the charm mesons",
    "a clear lifetime pattern emerges in agreement with the theoretical predictions :    @xmath13    even the expectations  @xcite for the charm baryon lifetimes reproduce the data , which is quite remarkable since , in addition to the exchange diagram , there are constructive as well as destructive contributions to the decay rate .",
    "the experimental results lead to the following baryon lifetime hierarchy :    @xmath14",
    "traditionally , the semileptonic decays of heavy flavored particles are accessible to both collider and fixed target experiments .",
    "the decays have clean and distinguishable signatures , and the cabbibo - allowed decay channels like @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 have large branching ratios .",
    "their fully explicit decay rates can be calculated from first principles , for example , theoretical tools like feynman diagrams .",
    "involving a lepton in the final decay stage implies that we do not have to worry about the usual final state interaction between hadrons .",
    "the possible complications coming from qcd corrections of the decay process are contained in form factors .",
    "the form factors can be calculated by various methods , lattice gauge theories ( lgt ) and quark models .",
    "the angular distributions and invariant masses among the decay products would determine the form factors ratios while the branching ratio measurements and information from the ckm matrix would give the absolute scale for the form factors .",
    "for the last 20 years , people regarded the @xmath18 decays as 100% @xmath19 events .",
    "the e687 and e691 groups set an upper limit for the possible scalar contributions in the @xmath20 decays  @xcite , but they could not provide clear evidence of decay paths other than the dominant p - wave @xmath16 channel .",
    "the situation was changed when the next generation data set from the focus spectrometer was analyzed to get form factors of the @xmath18 decays  @xcite .",
    "after the selection cuts involving vertex confidence levels and particle identification requirements , we obtained 31,254 @xmath18 and its charge conjugate decays . during the form factor analysis",
    ", we checked the angular distribution of kaon in the @xmath21 rest frame ( @xmath22 and found that it showed a huge forward - backward asymmetry below the @xmath23 pole mass while almost no asymmetry above the pole . since the @xmath24 is a p - wave , pure @xmath25 decays",
    "would have shown only a symmetric forward - backward @xmath26 distribution over the entire @xmath21 invariant mass range .",
    "this suggests a possible quantum mechanics interference effect .",
    "a simple approach to emulate the interference effect is adding a spin zero amplitude in the matrix elements of the @xmath18 decays .",
    "we tried a constant amplitude with a phase , @xmath27 , in the place where the @xmath24 couples to the spin zero component of the @xmath28 particle .",
    "we made the simplest assumption that the @xmath29 dependence of this anomaly s - wave coupling would be the same as that of the @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath18 event is a 4-body decay , which is represented by 5 kinematic variables , two invariant masses and three angular variables . for each of these variables , we extracted interference effects by using various weighting schemes and studied if our measured @xmath30 and @xmath31 are working properly in reproducing the effects for monte carlo ( mc ) events  @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : costv_mkpi ] where the invariant mass of the @xmath21 particles are weighted by @xmath26 , the interference effect is reproduced with satisfaction .",
    "our measured phase of @xmath32 relative to the @xmath23 is consistent with the one found by lass collaboration for isosinglet s - wave around the k * pole from a @xmath21 phase shift analysis  @xcite .",
    "our data is consistent with a broad resonance interpretation as well , but the pole of the resonance would be located above the @xmath24 pole in absence of any fsi re - phasing .",
    "we tried a @xmath33 resonance hypothesis .",
    "it turned out that to produce the interference effect , a 100 degree phase shift is needed between the @xmath34 and the @xmath24 .",
    "one interesting side effect of the s - wave interference is that it breaks the @xmath35 symmetry of the distribution of the azimuthal angle ( @xmath36 ) between the @xmath21 and the @xmath28 decay planes in the @xmath11 rest frame .",
    "the proper definition of @xmath36 requires that it should change sign between @xmath18 and its charge conjugate decays . without the proper sign convention , we would see a false cp violation between the charge conjugate decays in the @xmath36 distribution .",
    "to      we measured the relative branching ratio between @xmath37 and @xmath38 decays . with a tighter selection than the one used in the interference analysis , we selected 11,698 @xmath18 and its charge conjugate decays . with a selection cut set designed to be similar to the one applied upon",
    "the @xmath18 decays , we obtained 65,421 @xmath38 and its charge conjugate decays . from a mc study",
    ", we determined that the pure @xmath37 events are 94.5% of the selected events .",
    "when this correction factor is applied , we obtained  @xcite , = 0.602 0.0100.021 when comparing this muon decay channel result with electron decay channel results from other experiments , a correction factor 1.05 should be applied .",
    "our number , the only one considered an s - wave interference explicitly , is 1.6 @xmath39 lower than the recent cleo ii result from the electronic decay channel  @xcite and 2.1 @xmath39 higher than the e691 measurement  @xcite . including our result , the new world average of @xmath40 is 0.62 @xmath41 0.02 each experiment s statistical and systematic errors were added in quadrature prior to making the weighted average .",
    "we also measured the relative branching ratio between @xmath42 and @xmath43 decays .",
    "our selection yields 793 @xmath42 and its charge conjugate decays , and 2,192 @xmath43 and its charge conjugate decays .",
    "the result is  @xcite = 0.5400.0330.048 our number is comparable with all the other measurements in this channel , and the new world average of @xmath44 is 0.540 @xmath41 0.040 .",
    "we measured the form factor ratios of @xmath37 and it charge conjugate decays with consideration on the s - wave contribution .",
    "our study shows that the effect of s - wave on the measurement is minimal while the effect of charm background is significant .",
    "the new focus results are as follows  @xcite , & r_v = 1.504 0.057 0.039 + & r_2 = 0.875 0.049 0.064 our @xmath45 value is 2.9 @xmath39 below the e791 measurements  @xcite , but consistent with others .",
    "our @xmath46 value is consistent with other measurements .",
    "the new world averages are 1.66 @xmath41 0.060 and 0.827 @xmath41 0.055 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the proper interpretation of the hadronic decays is more complicated than expected .",
    "we observed that final state interactions ( fsi ) play a central role in the hadronic decays .",
    "for example our recent analysis on the branching ratio @xmath47  @xcite , confirm that fsi are fundamental .",
    "actually an isospin analysis of the channels @xmath48 and @xmath49 reveals that the elastic fsi can not account for all the large deviation from unity ( we measure @xmath50 ) of this ratio .",
    "the most reasonable explanation seems to be inelastic fsi that also allow for the transition @xmath51 .    for the multibody modes , where resonances are present",
    ", we think that the amplitude analysis ( dalitz plot analysis ) is the correct way to determine the resonant substructure of the decays .",
    "an extensive program of dalitz plot analyses is going on for the 3-body final states .",
    "actually focus is conducting a pioneer work using , for the first time in the analyses of charm decays , the formalism of k - matrix .",
    "as an example consider the _",
    "cp_-odd state @xmath52 from the decay mode @xmath53 ; one can not get a _ pure _",
    "_ cp_-odd eigenstate near the @xmath54 region because of the presence of the _ cp_-even @xmath55 decaying into the same final state .",
    "instead a dalitz plot analysis is necessary to determine properly the relative fractions . and this is valid also for the beauty decay mode .",
    "the focus experiment has measured the lifetime of all the weakly decaying singly charmed particles , establishing the charm lifetime hierachy .",
    "we found new s - wave interference phenomena in @xmath18 decays . considering this effect in further analyses , we measured the branching ratio @xmath56 and the form factor ratios of @xmath18 decays with improved statistical errors .",
    "we also measured the branching ratio @xmath57 .        at 30 years from the discovery of the _ c _ quark the physics analyses of the first heavy quark",
    "have reached a complete maturity . with the large statistics now available in the charm sector",
    "we start to see unexpected effects which complicate the interpretation of the decay processes , both in semileptonic and hadronic decays .    9 j.l .",
