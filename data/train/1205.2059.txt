    "some facultatively sexual populations are in fact remarkably close to this simple `` @xmath55 and @xmath54 '' model .",

    "( [ eq : rec_kernel ] ) @xcite .",

    "the best - fitting additive model is in general time dependent , and the heritability can change as the allele frequencies change @xcite .",
    "we know rather little about the genetic architecture of fitness , which justifies the the use of such simple models . in specific scenarios where the genotype - phenotype map is known , more detailed modeling should be guided by the general conclusions drawn from the `` @xmath55 and @xmath54 '' model .    the variation that we assume is always present among the recombinant off - spring , it is ultimately fueled by mutations",
    "the balance between the influx of beneficial mutations and selection in facultatively sexual population has been investigated in @xcite . even in sexual populations",
    ", the dynamics of mutation can be strongly affected by the selection through the clonal structure of the population .",
    "the participation ratio , @xmath0 , is exactly the probability for two individuals to be genetically identical .",
    "therefore , it immediately gives a measure of the clonal structure of the population .",
    "if the two genotypes are identical , they have had a common ancestor in the recent past .",
    "hence , @xmath205 is proportional to the rate of coalescence , and as soon as @xmath205 is no longer proportional to @xmath160 , coalescence is greatly accelerated relative to a neutral model .",
    "it is well known that selection accelerates coalescence since fit individuals have more offspring and dominate future generations .",
    "recombination tends to reduce the effects of linked selection since it decouples different regions of the genome .",
    "we have calculated the rate of coalescence in our model , which is set by a balance between selection and recombination .",
    "we have shown that there is a critical recombination rate , where recombination is overwhelmed by selection and the population structure changes qualitatively .    in the case of additive fitness functions",
    ", we have found that @xmath215 $ ] , which is in agreement with earlier work @xcite . in this case , the population consists of clones apparent as little `` bubbles '' in the representation of fig .  [ fig : clones ] .",
    "any such bubble originates from a common ancestor @xmath216 generations in the past , and @xmath217 is the probability that two individuals belong to the same `` bubble '' .",
    "this bubble - coalescent is similar to ideas developed for structured populations @xcite or the fitness class coalescent @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the clone - size distribution is very long tailed and the bubble coalescent is not in the universality class of the kingman coalescent @xcite , but possibly of bolthausen - sznitman type @xcite .    genetic identity between some of the individuals",
    "reduces the effect of outcrossing , since identical parents produce identical offspring . since the probability of such an occurrence is equal to @xmath0 , the effective rate of recombination in the partly clonal population is @xmath218 .",
    "hence , strictly speaking our calculations of @xmath219 deep in the clonal condensation regime must be taken through a self - consistency step , which replaces @xmath5 that was hereto an independent variable by a dependent variable @xmath220 .",
    "this however would not change our estimates for @xmath221 and @xmath222 , which are defined by the point of first emergence of clones ( when @xmath0 rises above @xmath223 ) .",
    "going beyond the mft description of recombination , one may define a participation ratio _ density _",
    "@xmath224 in terms of which @xmath225 which picks up the fitness dependence of @xmath0 : individuals with relatively high fitness are much more likely to be clonally related .",
    "the significance of @xmath0 is not limited to the case of exact genetic identity within clones .",
    "in particular , mutations would introduce additional polymorphic loci into the  clones \" that were the focus of our study . yet",
    "the genetic structure of the population introduced by clonal condensation still survives : one only needs to distinguish between high - frequency polymorphisms , which are being reshuffled by recombination as approximated by our model and the low frequency new polymorphisms due to recent ( on the time scale of clonal growth ) mutations .",
    "the latter would appear on the background that is clonal with respect to the high - frequency alleles .",
    "thus the  clones \" emerging at low @xmath5 should be thought of as haplotypes @xcite and the  clonal condensation \" is the process that suppresses the number of haplotypes on small length scales .",

    "as currently defined @xmath226 ( where @xmath227 stands for the genetic distance between @xmath228 and @xmath229 ) .",
    "this is immediately recognizable as a special case of the parisi order parameter @xmath230 @xcite .",
    "the latter therefore provides an interesting representation of the haplotypic structure of populations .",
    "it would be interesting to understand whether more realistic models of fitness landscapes ( with low order , rather than random epistasis ) would generate more complex hierarchical structure of @xmath231 than the simple  dust / clone \" dichotomy found in our simply model .",
    "the relation between the rem and sherrington - kirkpatrick models of spin glasses @xcite could provide useful guidance and ultimately yield better understanding of haplotype distributions and recombinant coalescents @xcite .",

    "this phase is characterized by large fluctuations in clone size distribution , and hence in @xmath0 , even in the approximation imposing a fixed traveling wave velocity @xmath52 . in reality",

    "we have already described in fig .",

    "( needless to say , the existence of the mixed phase region corresponds to the 1st order nature of the clonal condensation transition for @xmath232 . )",
    "a fully quantitative description of this behavior would require going beyond mft .",
    "so far , attempts to describe fluctuations in the dynamics of adaptation have been few and far apart @xcite : a quantitative description of the  stick - slip \" progress of adaptation would represent a major step forward .",
    "another necessary extension of the model involves mutational influx .",
    "a non - zero mutation rate would provide an influx of genetic variation and define true statistically stationary states corresponding to adaptive traveling waves @xcite or , in the presence of both deleterious and beneficial mutations , to a dynamic mutation selection balance @xcite .",
    "in that case , emergent clones become  fuzzy \" as they accumulate mutations , and the participation ratio should be replaced by a more general parisi order parameter as explained above",
    ". the result should provide interesting quantitative insight into the expected genetic structure of facultatively sexual populations .",
    "perhaps the most interesting and important extension of the present work would involve a generalization of the model and its analysis to linear genomes and obligatory sexual populations .",
    "in contrast to the current model where recombination freely re - assorts the loci , a more realistic linear chromosome model would describe recombination in terms of relatively infrequent crossover .",
    "this would naturally tie the frequency of recombination to the length of the segment considered .",
    "we expect that on sufficiently short scales , where recombination is infrequent , a tendency for haplotype condensation would be manifest if the population is diverse enough . whether epistasis plays a significant role in the condensation process will depend on the distribution of epistatic interactions along the genome @xcite .",
    "if there is a strong tendency of mutations to interact with mutations nearby @xcite , the heritability decreases as smaller and smaller segments are considered .",
    "this could result in condensation of mutations into `` super - alleles '' .",
    "however , the embedding of the haplotype in question into a larger genome gives rise to complications related to hill - robertson interference @xcite .",
    "transient associations with other genomic regions will either boost ( the hitch - hiking process ) or suppress ( background selection ) the spread of a haplotype in the population .",
    "this reduces the efficacy of selection and gives rise to a stochastic dynamics with rather different properties than genetic drift @xcite . bridging the different scales and resulting dynamical regimes represent an important challenge for the future .      in conclusion",
    ", we stress the distinction between the qle and  clonal condensation \" regimes . in the qle regime , recombination is sufficiently rapid to overwhelm any clonal amplification due to selection , and correlations between alleles at different loci are relatively weak . in this regime ,",
    "the correlations between loci are well described by linkage disequilibrium , which measures population averaged pair correlation of loci .",
    "by contrast , clonal condensation is a non - perturbative , large deviation from linkage equilibrium ( under which loci are completely uncorrelated ) , which in particular results in a stratification of the population depending on its fitness : clones appear predominantly in the upper reaches of the fitness distribution . strong heterogeneity among individuals along the fitness axis is not captured by measuring linkage disequilibrium and other traditional approaches . understanding strong interactions in multi - locus systems requires new ideas and tools .",

    "<S> genetic diversity is the fodder for natural selection and the fuel of evolution . </S>",
    "<S> it is generated by mutations and by recombination , which reshuffles genomes and thereby accelerates the exploration of the space of genotypes . </S>",

    "<S> alleles , present at @xmath2 ( biallelic ) polymorphic loci . </S>",
    "<S> of course the number of polymorphic loci , @xmath2 , itself changes as new mutations arise forming new polymorphisms while  older \" polymorphisms disappear from the population . </S>",
    "<S> the population itself consists of @xmath3 individuals which sample only a small fraction of the possible genotypes , i.e.  @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics in genotype space is therefore highly stochastic .    of particular importance </S>",
    "<S> are those genetic polymorphisms that affect the fitness of individuals , the fitness being defined as the expected number of offspring in the next generation . </S>",
    "<S> selection on its own would amplify the number of high fitness individuals and condense the population into a few  clones \" comprising a large fraction of the population . in populations of sexually reproducing organisms , </S>",
    "<S> the growth of such clones and the subsequent decline of genetic diversity are checked by recombination . </S>",
    "<S> two parents , if chosen from different clones , produce offspring that are distinct from either parent . in obligate sexually reproducing species , the formation of clones is prevented since reproduction is coupled to recombination and no parent can produce genetically identical offspring . </S>",
    "<S> many species , in particular microbial species and plants , can reproduce both by clonal reproduction ( e.g. , budding in yeast , selfing or vegetative reproduction in plants ) or by sexual propagation . </S>",
    "<S> such facultatively sexual species display a great variety in their mode of propagation , the frequency @xmath5 of outcrossing , and the heritability of fitness . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is very important in sexual populations , as it determines to what extend recombinant offspring benefit from the same fitness advantages that made their parents successful .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this article is to describe quantitatively the competing tendencies of natural selection and recombination with regard to genetic diversity , focusing on facultatively sexual organisms . </S>",
    "<S> the competition of natural selection with recombination is the dominant mechanism of evolution on relatively short time scales , on which mutational input is negligible compared to diversification by recombination . </S>",
    "<S> this situation is particularly relevant to adaptation following a major outcrossing event , or within a so called hybrid zone , where diverged genotypes have come together to generate a hybrid population . as this hybrid population continues to breed within itself </S>",
    "<S> , it can give rise to a bout of rapid adaptation , as beneficial alleles from both original populations are combined to form novel fit genotypes that spread within the hybrid population @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the probability , @xmath0 , that two random individuals sampled from the population have the same genotype , i.e. , are clones of each other . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is important for population genetics , since it characterizes genetic diversity ( its inverse is a measure of the number of dominant clones ) as well as the dynamics of coalescence . </S>",
    "<S> whenever two individuals are part of the same clone , they share a recent common ancestor , such that @xmath0 is proportional to the rate of pair coalescence . in the canonical theory of neutral coalescence , </S>",
    "<S> this rate is equal to the inverse population size . </S>",
    "<S> we will find here that @xmath0 , and with it the rate of coalescence , is determined by the clonal structure rather than the population size at low outcrossing rates .    </S>",
    "<S> much of our analysis is presented in the context of a facultatively sexual population , where the evolving entities are individuals and their genotypes . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that some of our considerations also hold for contiguous segments of chromosomal dna that are short enough to undergo only infrequent recombination even in obligatory sexual reproduction . in that case </S>",

    "<S> a complementary view of this probability relates it to the  haplotype diversity \" , i.e. , the number and population distribution of distinct genomic sequences for the chromosomal segment in question . </S>",
    "<S> we shall return to this important question in the discussion . in an earlier publication @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that clones are absent in the so called quasi linkage equilibrium ( qle )  phase \" corresponding to frequent outcrossing limit but appear in a regime of small out - crossing frequency @xmath6 , with @xmath7 depending on the complexity of the fitness landscape ( i.e.  the extent of fitness additivity ) and weakly dependent on @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we will review this finding and present a more detailed analysis of the time dependence of this condensation phenomenon , as well as its quantitative dependence on fitness additivity and hence heritability . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also study the extend of clonal condensation in a steady state where the fitness distribution is moving towards higher fitness at a constant velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we will put these results into the context of the random energy model ( rem ) of statistical physics , introduced and solved by bernard derrida @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath0 is closely related to the parisi order parameter and the onset of clonality is closely related to the spin - glass transition observed in simple models of disordered media such as the rem .    </S>",
    "<S> below , we will first draw the analogy between the dynamics of selection in finite populations and the rem . </S>",
    "<S> this analogy is particularly simple for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the condensation transition in the rem occurs below a certain critical temperature , the transition to clonal population structure occurs beyond a certain critical time , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the population genetic analog of temperature will be the inverse time . </S>",
    "<S> we shall then generalize the model in order to include ( facultative ) recombination and fitness landscapes with varying degrees of epistasis , i.e. , genetic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the results for mixed epistatic and additive models enables us to set the analysis into the context of the  traveling wave \" approximation , which has recently emerged as a powerful representation of adaptive population dynamics in genetically diverse populations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results therefore provide insight into how recombination and epistasis affect the dynamics and structure of adapting population waves and define conditions under which genetic diversity is maintained or lost . </S>"
