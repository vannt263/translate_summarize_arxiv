    "the study of the density matrices of identical particles ( bosons or fermions ) moving freely in a box @xcite is generalized in this paper to the case of identical particles in a parabolic confinement potential with either harmonic interactions between the particles , or with an anisotropy induced by a homogeneous magnetic field on top of the parabolic confinement .",
    "this model , giving rise to repetitive gaussian integrals , allows to derive an analytical expression for the generating function of the partition function . for an ideal gas of non - interacting particles in a parabolic well , this generating function coincides with the grand - canonical partition function . with interactions ,",
    "the calculation of this generating function circumvents the constraints on the summation over the cycles of the permutation group .",
    "moreover , it allows one to calculate the canonical partition function recursively for the system with harmonic two - body interactions .",
    "the theory is developed both for fermions and for bosons . in view of the recent interest in bose - einstein condensation in a trap @xcite ,",
    "more attention has been payed to the boson case in the discussion of the results .",
    "the model system discussed here has already been studied in the context of quantum dots with operator techniques , and the eigenvalues and eigenstates were calculated including the effect of harmonic two - body interactions and in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge neither the boson case nor the thermodynamics seems to have been analyzed previously .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the idea of first expanding the hilbert space to the configuration space and then projecting onto the appropriate subspace by group theoretical means has been used recently @xcite in the context of quantum dots to study the ground state correlations for fermions and bosons .",
    "another motivation to perform the present analytical calculations lies in our path integral formulation of the density matrices for @xmath0 particles@xcite .",
    "indeed , particles in a parabolic potential are a favorite testing ground for the path integral method@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that for our formulation the existence of a positive measure over a well defined domain in the @xmath1 configuration space is essential in view of any algorithmic approach to the problem . in the present paper , which is in essence analytical , integrations over the configuration space",
    "are performed .",
    "the reason is that the extension of the state space to the configuration space makes the gaussian integrals tractable .",
    "the permutation symmetry leads to summations over the cycles which are performed using the generating function technique , which is one of the main results of the present paper .    the model of @xmath0 identical particles in a parabolic",
    "well , in the presence of a magnetic field and with harmonic repulsive or attractive two - body interactions has its intrinsic value , since it constitutes an exactly soluble idealization of atoms in a magnetic trap .",
    "it should be stressed that the association of identical particles with each three oscillator degrees of freedom makes the model @xmath2 . without bose - einstein or fermi - dirac statistics ,",
    "i.e. for `` distinguishable '' particles , the model is equivalent with @xmath3 one dimensional oscillators , because each degree of freedom decouples in such a way that there is no difference in statistical behavior between @xmath3 @xmath4 oscillators and @xmath0 @xmath2 oscillators @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the calculation technique is explained in the next section . in the subsequent section we repeat the same calculation for the model with a homogeneous magnetic field . in section",
    "iv the results for @xmath4 bosons and fermions are given .",
    "in section v bosons in @xmath5 are analyzed in some detail , and in the last section the conclusions are given .",
    "in this section we calculate the partition function of @xmath0 identical particles with the following lagrangian including one - body and two - body potentials @xmath6    ( atomic units are used . )",
    "the potentials can be rewritten in terms of the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath7 and coordinates @xmath8 describing the coordinates of the particles measured from the center of mass @xmath9 from which @xmath10 with @xmath11 the requirement that @xmath12 has to be positive expresses the stability condition that the confining potential has to be strong enough to overcome the repulsion between the particles .",
    "if an harmonic interparticle * attraction * is considered , the eigenfrequency @xmath12 would become @xmath13 and no stability condition has to be imposed on the confining potential .",
    "notice that these transformations do neither diagonalize the lagrangian nor the hamiltonian , because the coordinates @xmath14 are _ not _ independent of the center - of - mass coordinate .",
    "since the system consists in each direction of 1 degree of freedom with frequency @xmath15 and @xmath16 degrees of freedom with frequency @xmath17 the propagator @xmath18 for * distinguishable * particles ( indicated by the subscript @xmath19 for 3 dimensions and @xmath20 in 1 dimension ) can be calculated from the action expressed in the imaginary time variable , and it is of course a product of the propagators @xmath21 per component : @xmath22 where the column vector @xmath23 contains the @xmath24-components of the particles , i.e. @xmath25 and similarly for @xmath26 and @xmath27 knowing the propagator @xmath28 of a single harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath29@xmath30 one finds for the 1-dimensional propagator @xmath21 of the @xmath0 distinguishable oscillators in the interacting system : @xmath31 where the factor @xmath32 in @xmath33 accounts for the mass @xmath0 ( in atomic units ) of the center .",
    "the denominator in ( [ eqkdexplicit ] ) compensates for the fact that @xmath16 instead of @xmath0 degrees of freedom of frequency @xmath12 are available .",
    "the 3-dimensional propagator @xmath34 ( [ eqkddef ] ) for @xmath0 distinguishable oscillators of the interacting system is , according to ( [ eqkdseparate ] ) and ( [ eqkdexplicit ] ) , given by @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes a point in the configuration space @xmath38 i.e. @xmath39 . the symmetrized density matrix @xmath40 for 3d identical particles ( indicated by the subscript @xmath41 can be obtained by using the following projection , with @xmath42 denoting the permutation matrix : @xmath43 where @xmath44 for bosons and @xmath45 for fermions . it should be emphasized that @xmath42 acts on the particle indices , not on the components of @xmath46 separately .",
    "the partition function is then readily obtained by integrating over the configuration space @xmath47    the remaining part of this section will be devoted to the explicit evaluation of this integral for the partition function .",
    "the integration proceeds in 3 stages : the first stage deals with the center - of - mass treatment , the second one concerns the cyclic decomposition , and in the third step the summation over the cycles will be performed .",
    "the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath7 does not only depend on the coordinates of all the particles , but it also has its own propagator . therefore substituting @xmath7 by its expression in terms of the particle positions and",
    "then performing the integration seems not to be the most adequate way to deal with the integration over the configuration space .",
    "instead , the following identity is used for the formal treatment of @xmath7 as an independent coordinate , at the expense of additional integrations : @xmath48 fourier transformation of the @xmath49-function then leads to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a @xmath3 dimensional row vector . applying this transformation to the partition function @xmath52 and rearranging the factors one obtains @xmath53    this transformation makes @xmath7 independent of the particle positions relative to the center of mass .",
    "the real dependence on the relative positions is reintroduced by the fourier transform .",
    "it should be noted that the explicit dependence of the propagator ( [ eqkdproduct ] ) on @xmath54 and the presence of the factor @xmath55 are consequences of the two - body interactions .",
    "the next step is to rewrite the sum over the permutations as a sum over all possible cycles .",
    "this will be done in the next subsection .",
    "an excellent example of such a decomposition into cycles has been given by feynman @xcite for a system of non - interacting particles in a box .",
    "a permutation can be broken up into cycles .",
    "suppose that a particular permutation contains @xmath56 cycles of length@xmath57 the positive integers @xmath56 and @xmath58 then have to satisfy the constraint @xmath59 furthermore , the number @xmath60 of cyclic decompositions with @xmath61 cycles of length @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath56 cycles of length @xmath64 @xmath65 is known to be @xmath66    a cycle of length @xmath58 will be obtained from @xmath67 permutations .",
    "therefore the sign factor @xmath68 can be decomposed as @xmath69 combining these result originating from the permutation symmetry one obtains @xmath70 @xmath71 the @xmath49-function expresses that the decomposition is cyclic .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath72 which allows to analyze @xmath73 from its 1-dimensional constituents : @xmath74    using the semigroup property @xcite of the harmonic oscillator propagator @xmath75 all integrations but one can be performed @xmath76 where @xmath77 the integral ( [ eqkl1d ] ) is the propagator @xmath78 of a driven harmonic oscillator with the lagrangian @xmath79 studied in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted again that without two - body interactions the driving force ( [ eqdriving ] ) is lacking . taking over the result from @xcite and integrating over the configuration space one obtains @xmath80    after straightforward algebra one obtains for the 1d function @xmath81 : @xmath82 and for its 3d extension : @xmath83    using ( [ eqmlsum ] ) one then is left with a sixfold integral for the partition function @xmath84{l } \\int d{\\bf r}\\int \\frac{d{\\bf k}}{\\left ( 2\\pi \\right ) ^3}e^{i{\\bf k}\\cdot   { \\bf r}}\\frac{k\\left ( \\sqrt{n}{\\bf r},\\beta |\\sqrt{n}{\\bf r},0\\right ) _ \\omega } { k\\left ( \\sqrt{n}{\\bf r},\\beta |\\sqrt{n}{\\bf r},0\\right ) _",

    "the partition function @xmath52 only differs from it by a center - of - mass correction and the actual values of @xmath89    the remaining summation over the cycles involves the constraint ( [ eqmlsum ] ) , which however can be removed by the use of the generating function technique , which will be considered in the next subsection .      concentrating on the explicit dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath90 ( with @xmath12 considered as a parameter ) , one can construct the following generating function @xmath91 with @xmath92 by definition .",
    "the partition function @xmath93 can then be obtained by taking the appropriate derivatives of @xmath94 with respect to @xmath95 assuming that the series for @xmath94 is convergent near @xmath96 : @xmath97 the summation over the number of cycles with length @xmath58 is now unrestricted , and can easily be performed : @xmath98 this series can be rewritten into the more familiar form @xmath99    it should be noted in view of the remarks at the end of the preceding section concerning @xmath88 , that @xmath100 is also the generating function of a model without two - body interactions . in that case @xmath12",
    "equals @xmath101 and @xmath102 coincides with the well known @xcite grand canonical partition function of a set of identical particles in a parabolic well .",
    "starting from the expression for @xmath102 derived in the previous subsection for the interacting model , a recursion relation can be obtained for @xmath88 . introducing : @xmath103 for brevity in the notations ,",
    "we observe that @xmath104 considering next @xmath105 the product rule and an elementary binomial expansion can be used to find @xmath106    the corresponding 1-dimensional version of this recurrence relation ( indicated with the subscript @xmath107 to distinguish it from the 3d case with capital subscript ) becomes @xmath108 leading to the following partition functions in closed form for one - dimensional bosons and one - dimensional fermions @xmath109 it is easy to check that these partition functions are the solution of the recurrence relation for @xmath110 with @xmath111 for bosons and @xmath45 for fermions .",
    "however we did not find a systematic method to obtain analytical solutions of this type of recurrence relations .",
    "e.g. for the 3d case we had to rely on numerical schemes , as will be discussed below .",
    "but at this stage , it is worthwhile first to consider the presence of an homogeneous magnetic field , as the origin of anisotropy in our model of @xmath0 identical oscillators .",
    "the lagrangian of @xmath0 particles in a confining parabolic potential in the presence of a magnetic field is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the cyclotron frequency . for this model ,",
    "the calculations of the preceding section can in essence be repeated .",
    "first the propagator for distinguishable particles is calculated",
    ". the next step will be the projection on the irreducible representation of the permutation group , and performing the cyclic decomposition .",
    "then the generating function is introduced to circumvent the constraints on the partition in cycles , and finally the summation over the cycles is performed .",
    "the fact that the energy spectrum and the wavefunction can be calculated when harmonic interparticle interactions are included @xcite indicates that the propagator and the partition function for the model in a magnetic field with two - body interaction can be obtained using our methods .",
    "the calculation technique is very demanding , therefore it seemed appropriate to illustrate the method at the hand of the simple model ( [ eqlmagn ] ) .",
    "for distinguishable particles , the many - particle propagator is a product of one - particle propagators .",
    "the one - particle propagator @xmath114 of this model can be calculated by stochastic techniques@xcite or by path integral techniques@xcite .",

    "we have thus obtained an expression for the grand - canonical partition function in the absence of two - body interactions for @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators , both with and without a magnetic field . for a system with harmonic two - body interactions , repulsive or attractive ,",
    "expressions for the canonical partition function are obtained ( in the absence of a magnetic field ) . the corresponding thermodynamic properties ( grand - canonical ground state occupancy , canonical and grand - canonical specific heat and average square radius ) of the confined system",
    "will be calculated in the next section .",
    "in the preceding sections we have obtained the grand canonical partition function of identical harmonic oscillators in a confining parabolic potential well without a magnetic field [ equation ( [ eqksinomagn ] ) ] and in the presence of a magnetic field [ equation ( [ eqksimagn ] ) ] .",
    "for the same system the canonical partition function is obtained for an attractive as well as for a repulsive harmonic two - body interaction [ equation ( [ eqzgeneral ] ) ] .",
    "the expressions are given for bosons and for fermions . in this section",
    "we will analyze the thermodynamical properties of the confined system in the case of motion in 1d .",
    "it should be noted that for the non - interacting case in 1d , we recover the results of ref . .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the interacting case has not been analyzed up to now for identical particles .",
    "for distinguishable particles it has been studied before @xcite .    in 1d , the explicit expressions for @xmath125 largely facilitate the analysis : the free energy @xmath126 the internal energy @xmath127 and the specific heat @xmath128 can be readily obtained .",
    "the results are summarized in table i. the subscript @xmath129refers to the center - of - mass contribution .",
    "the center - of - mass correction @xmath130 to the specific heat which is an excess specific heat and therefore may be negative is shown in fig .",
    "1 . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the contribution @xmath131 to the specific heat , due to the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "note that @xmath131 is the same for 1d fermions and bosons ; bosonization implies this result @xcite .",
    "the spatial extension of the cloud of interacting identical particles can be obtained by applying the hellman - feynman theorem to the free energy : @xmath132 the difference @xmath133 between the mean square length of the 1d fermion and boson system turns out to be : @xmath134 it is proportional to the number of particles , and inversely proportional to the frequency @xmath12 of the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the calculation of the thermodynamic properties or the mean square radius of the 3d cloud of identical particles is substantially complicated by the lack of an explicit expression in closed form for the partition function .",
    "numerical methods have therefore to be used .",
    "we concentrate this analysis on the boson case . for fermions",
    "a different scheme will have to be developed and will be published later .      the recurrence relation ( [ zirecur ] ) is not directly accessible for numerical computation , as can easily be seen by evaluating the expected dominant factor @xmath135 for bosons . for a relatively low temperature and a moderate number of particles ,",
    "say @xmath136 and @xmath137 this factor is as small as @xmath138 we therefore isolate this factor using the following scaling for the partition function @xmath139 and rewrite the recurrence relation ( [ zirecur ] ) in terms of the activity @xmath140 ( see e.g. @xcite ) defined as @xmath141 where @xmath142 have been introduced for convenience .",
    "the recurrence relation ( [ zirecur ] ) then becomes after some manipulations @xmath143 the corresponding recurrence relation for the internal energy of the internal degrees of freedom becomes @xmath144 the temperature scale used to express @xmath145 is @xmath146    the routine used to calculate the values @xmath147 and @xmath148 from these recurrence relations ( [ eqrhorecur ] ) and ( [ equrecur ] ) is displayed in table ii .",
    "the values of @xmath147 for @xmath149 are shown in fig . 3 for the three temperatures @xmath150 1 and 2 . for @xmath151 it turns out that @xmath152 is about 8 times larger than @xmath153 for @xmath154 approaching @xmath155 which makes it extremely difficult to deal numerically with the values of the partition function rather than with the proportionality factors .",
    "once @xmath140 is known , the internal energy @xmath156 is readily obtained from ( [ equrecur ] ) . the results for @xmath157 100 and 1000",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the specific heat in the canonical ensemble can also be calculated from these parameters .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "5 , clearly illustrating the effect of condensation for a finite number of particles . anticipating the next subsection , it should be noted that the specific heat in the canonical ensemble for @xmath0 particles and without repulsive two - body interactions is identical to the specific heat in the grand canonical ensemble with the average number of particles given by the same value of @xmath158 the reason why we compare both ensembles without repulsive interactions is the requirement that in the grand canonical ensemble the system should be stable for any large number of particles , which is not the case in the gaussian model with repulsion , because the confining potential can only accommodate a finite number of particles as a consequence of ( [ eqeigenw ] )",
    ". another interesting consequence of the repulsive interactions follows from the dependence of the condensation temperature @xmath159 on the number of particles , which obeys the following scaling law taking ( [ eqeigenw ] ) into account : @xmath160 for the case of attractive interactions and no confinement potential , @xmath159 is proportional to @xmath161 the condensation temperature for both cases is plotted in fig .",
    "6 . for the gaussian model , the case of harmonic attraction does not pose any problem because in this model there is no sign of an `` extra '' collapse due to the nature of the interaction .",
    "the only consequence seems to be that the condensation occurs at a much higher temperature than would be the case without two - body interactions or with a repulsive harmonic interaction .",
    "the thermodynamic properties in the grand canonical ensemble of an ideal bose gas in a parabolic well and in the presence of a magnetic field can be obtained directly from ( [ eqzmagn ] ) and ( [ eqksimagn ] ) .",
    "substituting @xmath162 by the fugacity @xmath163 the gibbs free energy @xmath164 for the boson case ( @xmath44 ) becomes : @xmath165 after a power series expansion of the denominators , the summation over the cycle lengths @xmath58 can be performed : @xmath166 as expected from a bose - einstein distribution with energy levels @xmath167    the average number of particles @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 and the fugacity can be eliminated in favor of the ground state occupancy @xmath170 : @xmath171 restoring the cyclic summation for reasons of numerical convergence , one obtains for the average number of particles @xmath172 which can be cast in the form of the following numerically tractable series @xmath173 for given @xmath155 standard numerical techniques can be used to determine @xmath174 , $ ] and hence the ground state occupancy @xmath175 which is shown in fig . 7 for @xmath176 and in fig . 8 for @xmath177 as a function of @xmath178 for several values of @xmath158 it turns out that the parabolic well is more important than the anisotropy due to the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "the anisotropy only moderately influences the temperature dependence of the ground state occupancy .",
    "the internal energy @xmath179 becomes @xmath180 and its numerical evaluation once @xmath181 is determined presents no numerical difficulties .",
    "the resulting specific heat is shown in fig . 9 for @xmath182",
    "comparison with fig .",
    "5 reveals that the anisotropy due to the magnetic field essentially broadens the peak in the specific heat near the condensation temperature , but does not substantially alter the structure .",
    "in this paper we applied the method of symmetrical density matrices , developed by feynman for a system of non - interacting particles in a box , to a system of harmonically interacting particles in a confining parabolic potential .",
    "the interaction could be taken into account , due to the gaussian nature of the propagators , allowing integration over the configuration space .",
    "the symmetrization resulting from the projection of the propagators for distinguishable particles on the appropriate representation of the permutation group gives rise to a series which could be summed using the generating function technique . without these generating functions",
    "the calculation has to be restricted to a limited number of particles @xcite . using them",
    "not only the grand canonical partition function @xmath94 could be obtained in the parameter range of the model where @xmath94 is well defined , but also the canonical partition functions @xmath183 for a given number @xmath0 of identical particles could be obtained as a recursion of partition functions of a smaller number of particles for the interacting system . the recurrence relation for the activity",
    "@xmath184 i.e. the proportionality factor between @xmath183 and @xmath185 allows for an accurate numerical treatment of the thermodynamical quantities of the model , such as the internal energy and the specific heat .    also the thermodynamic properties of the same model in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field",
    "could be investigated along these lines .",
    "a detailed analysis of the ideal gas in a confining parabolic potential with anisotropy due to a magnetic field was presented ; special attention was payed to the relation between the number of condensed atoms , the magnetic field , the strength of the confinement potential and the total number of particles .",
    "the relationship between the parameters of our model and the characteristics of atomic traps @xcite lies beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "it should be mentioned that in the absence of two - body interactions , the generating function can be identified as the grand canonical partition function . in that case",
    "the specific heat as obtained from the grand canonical ensemble for an average number of @xmath186 particles calculated using the chemical potential equals the specific heat obtained from the canonical ensemble with the number of particles @xmath0 given by @xmath187 for a more elaborate discussion we refer to @xcite .",
    "it should also be mentioned that in this the model it is assumed that the spin degrees of freedom are fixed .",
    "this simplifying assumption is imposed by the symmetrization method , which becomes more involved if the spin degrees of freedom depend on the configuration of the particles .    in summary ,",
    "the partition function of a general gaussian model for bosons and fermions , with or without a magnetic field , has been calculated analytically , and the thermodynamical properties of this model have been studied .",
