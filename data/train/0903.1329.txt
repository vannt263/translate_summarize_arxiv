    "most searches for transiting extrasolar transiting planets fall into two broad categories ( see , eg , @xcite ) : very wide - field searches targeting bright ( @xmath1 ) stars , and narrower field , pointed , dense - field observations monitoring fainter ( @xmath2 ) stars ( fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    ". surveys of brighter stars have the advantage of more efficient spectroscopic follow - up due to the larger fluxes of their candidates .",
    "fainter searches are typically more efficient in the discovery phase , using less telescope time to densely monitor a similar number of dwarf star targets .",
    "the space - based corot ( @xcite ) and kepler ( @xcite ) missions bridge part of this gap , pointing at particular dense stellar fields at low galactic latitude , with the expectation that most of their prime target stars will have @xmath3 .",
    "this middle range is their `` sweet spot '' because the stellar mass function ensures that most dwarf hosts will lie at the faint end , while the best photometry required to search for small planets is achieved at the bright end .",
    "certainly the transiting planets reported by the corot team to date , all with jovian sizes , have host stars in this magnitude range ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stars of this magnitude and fainter are increasingly more likely to be blended with foreground or background stars of similar brightness .",
    "furthermore , the ability to perform spectroscopic tests to rule out the possibility that a blended eclipsing binary is masquerading as a transiting planet becomes increasingly difficult as the host star becomes fainter . since jovian - sized planets generate a @xmath41% dip in host brightness when transiting a sun - like star , a ( totally ) eclipsing stellar binary ( ecb ) system can be nearly five magnitudes fainter than a random blended neighbour along the line - of - sight and still generate a jovian - like transit signal against the bright blended composite . for the same reason , surveys for terrestrial - sized planets must be able to exclude possible blended ecb up to the _ ten _ magnitudes fainter than their survey targets . clearly , this is an issue that the corot and kepler teams will have to face in confirming planets whose apparent masses are too small to yield a robust radial velocity signature .",
    "we were led to consider the issue of possible confusion with an ecb in follow - up work directed at the prime planetary transit candidate , lupus - tr-3b ( @xcite ) , found in our initial deep survey of the lupus region . like the corot ( _ serpens cauda _ : @xmath5 ; _ monoceros _ : @xmath6 ) and kepler ( _ cygnus _ : @xmath7 ) fields , our lupus survey was performed in a dense galactic field ( _ lupus _ : @xmath8 ) .    in our survey , we monitored about 110,000 stars over a 0.66 square degree field in lupus for 53 nights in june of 2005 and 2006 with the anu 40-inch telescope equipped with a wide field imager at siding spring observatory ( sso ) in australia ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting 1783 exposures produced photometry to a precision of better than 0.025  mag ( rms ) for @xmath416,000 stars .",
    "the photometry was produced using an image subtraction technique , followed by sysrem ( @xcite ) to remove systematics ( red noise ) common to a large number of stars in the field .",
    "the bls detection scheme of kovcs et al .",
    "( 2002 ) was then used to identify promising candidates for the host stars of transiting planets .",
    "this initial two - year survey is being extended in time to yield the superlupus survey ( @xcite ) , will increase the sensitivity to longer period transiting planets .",
    "magnitude of host stars reported to have transiting planets.,width=528 ]    the initial photometric selection process produced six candidates in the lupus field , whose basic characteristics are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "more details will be forthcoming in a subsequent publication ( @xcite ) .",
    "all candidates were detected at a high level of significance , with a large number of in - transit photometric measurements , and depth - duration - period properties , as measured by the @xmath9 diagnostic ( @xcite ) , that made them plausible transiting planet signatures .",
    "0.5 cm    .characteristics of lupus survey candidates [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     after further scrutiny and follow - up observations , however , only lupus - tr-3 remained as a plausible candidate ( bayliss et al , 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "the k1 dwarf exhibits a 1.3% dip of about 2.6  hour duration every @xmath10  days .",
    "subsequent radial velocity measurements taken with the mike echelle spectrograph on magellan i displayed a confirming radial velocity signature of @xmath11  m / s , appropriately in phase with the transit .",
    "the planet , lupus - tr-3b , thus has derived parameters of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , yielding a quite jovian - like density of @xmath14  gm/@xmath15 ( weldrake et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "this might have been the end of the story , had we not simultaneously been pursuing image deconvolution as a method to discover possible close neighbours in the vicinity of promising candidates .",
    "the long train of monitoring images used to discover lupus - tr-3b were obtained at sso , a site with only moderate atmospheric seeing conditions .",
    "furthermore , the anu  40-inch telescope is known to have guider issues , and so the 5-minute frames were taken unguided . as a result",
    ", a typical image would have a stellar point spread function ( psf ) with a full width at half maximum of fwhm  @xmath16 .",
    "although this is considerably better image quality than obtained by wide - field transit surveys against bright stars , we decided to apply image deconvolution to the immediate lupus - tr-3 field as an experiment aimed at the possibility of finding a line - of - sight `` neighbour '' within the typical fwhm .",
    "for this purpose , we used a package originally developed for use in extragalactic lensing , but later optimised for point sources .",
    "this algorithm , decphot ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , weights the psf properly in the statistical sense , and uses all of the information on the image to achieve the best deconvolution . on the other hand ,",
    "it is cpu intensive , so that it is generally applied only to `` postage stamp '' areas around the immediate object of interest rather than to a complete ccd mosaic .",
    "an initial decphot application to our sso images revealed two possible neighbours , dubbed stars @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "star @xmath18 , located 2.2@xmath19 from lupus - tr-3 , is 5.6 @xmath20 magnitudes fainter than the target , and thus could not be responsible for the transit signature even if it was an ecb that fully eclipsed its primary .",
    "star @xmath17 , 1.7@xmath19 from the target is 4.1 @xmath20 magnitudes fainter , and could thus , in principle , be a planet - pretender .",
    "however , by performing photometry on a time - sequence of decphot deconvolved sso images covering both in- and out - of - transit epochs , we were able to demonstrate that lupus - tr-3 was undergoing a partial eclipse , not star @xmath17 ( @xcite ) .     and",
    "@xmath18 , were indicated.,width=384 ]    again , the story might have ended , had we not obtained a good seeing ( fwhm @xmath21 ) image of the lupus - tr-3 field in the @xmath22 band ( @xmath41.1 micron ) with the panic infrared imager on magellan ii , kindly provided by the las campanas observatory staff .",
    "our aim was to check the positions and relative brightness of neighbours predicted by the deconvolution of sso images .",
    "-band panic image of the lupus - tr-3 field reveals stars @xmath17 and @xmath18 , both predicted by decphot analysis of sso images , and also a very faint neighbour @xmath23 .",
    "insert : subsequent deconvolution of panic frames then predicted a very near neighbour , labelled @xmath24 , a possible , but unlikely , planet pretender.,width=288 ]    the magellan @xmath22 band image ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) indeed indicated that decphot had correctly identified blended neighbours @xmath17 and @xmath18 , but also indicated a third star , @xmath23 , 1.8@xmath19 from the target that was 4.3 @xmath22 magnitudes fainter than the lupus - tr-3 , and fainter still in @xmath20  too faint to be a culprit .",
    "naturally curious , however , we then applied decphot to the high - quality panic image . to our surprise , the deconvolution predicted yet another neighbour , this one , star @xmath24 , 2.8 magnitudes fainter in @xmath22 than the target , and only 0.4@xmath19 distant .",
    "the inability of decphot to identify it in our broad @xmath25 images from siding spring seemed to indicate that star @xmath24 must have @xmath26 , and thus would have to suffer an eclipse of 36% or more to create a spurious transit signal .",
    "its faintness , coupled with the unusually parameters required for an ecb to mimic our signal ( see weldrake et al 2008 ) , make star @xmath24 an unlikely , if possible , false positive .    nevertheless , in order to check this possibility , and to provide yet another test of decphot predictions , we applied for panic imaging time on magellan over two epochs that would cover both in- and out - of - transit points .",
    "the aim was to perform photometry on a time - series of deconvolved panic images capable of separating the original target star from the putative neighbour @xmath24 in order to directly discern , as we had earlier for star @xmath17 , which was undergoing a partial eclipse .",
    "these data were obtained in april and may of 2008 by one of us ( pds ) , producing over 200 frames in @xmath22-band with a typical psf of 0.55@xmath19 . a very rough reduction on the mountain ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) indicates that we have captured the transit to within the uncertainties on the transit timing predicted a year earlier .    .",
    "black ( darker ) points were taken in april 2008 , and red ( lighter ) points were obtained two periods later in may.,width=384 ]    after a first data reduction , small ( 250 @xmath27 250 pixel ) stamps around lupus - tr-3 were processed ( by mg ) using decphot , using only the best of the april 2008 data , namely those with seeing below 0.5@xmath19 .",
    "( note that the images are still well - sampled , as panic has pixels that translate into 0.125@xmath19 on the sky . )",
    "these data represent about 50% improvement in image quality compared to our earlier panic snapshot of the field .",
    "the results are surprising .",
    "while neighbours @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath23 are all seen at their decphot predicted positions and brightness , it appears that ( non - ecliping ) star b is actually two stars , here labelled @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "while it is unclear whether the faint , close neighbour @xmath24 originally predicted from decphot analysis of our earlier , somewhat poorer panic frame is actually present , it does seem clear that the primary target , lupus - tr-3 itself has two components , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ! the component @xmath31 is only 2.3 times fainter than @xmath30 according to our preliminary analysis , and the two are separated by only 0.25@xmath19 on the sky , making it conceivable that they form a wide , physical binary .",
    "our original lupus - tr-3 target , then , is composed of at least six , and perhaps seven , individual objects .     and @xmath23 , but also that the ( non - eclipsing ) star @xmath17 is actually composed of two components , as is the primary target .",
    "the length of the arrow denotes 1@xmath19 on the sky , indicating that this image is considerably zoomed compared to those in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3].,width=288 ]    we are now in the process of undertaking a more detailed , thorough study of all the panic frames from magellan of the lupus - tr-3 field in order to understand whether ( 1 ) star @xmath24 is present , and ( 2 ) star @xmath30 , @xmath31 or possibly @xmath24 is eclipsing .",
    "either @xmath30 or @xmath31 could host a transiting planet , albeit one of different planetary characteristics than were derived under the assumption that they formed a single star ( @xcite ) . in the meantime",
    ", we offer our experience as a cautionary tale for all those who might imagine that the target they are observing , especially in fields of low galactic latitude , is a single star with no faint , possibly ecb , blended neighbours , capable of mimicking a planetary transit .",
    "our experience with deep , high - spatial resolution imaging of the field of the planetary transit host star lupus - tr-3 suggest that :    * it is vital to constrain the presence of blended line - of - sight neighbours up to 5 magnitudes fainter than stars thought to host jovian - sized transiting planets , and up to 10 magnitudes fainter than those thought to host terrestrial - sized transiting planets .",
    "faint , eclipsing stellar binaries may otherwise cause an unacceptable level of false positives in searches for transiting extrasolar planets .",
    "* fields of low galactic latitude ( @xmath32  deg or less ) have a relatively high probabilities of such impostors and confusing contaminants . * even faint , undetected , _",
    "non_-ecb neighbours will influence the inferred radius of detected planets , by causing an underestimation of the true transit depth , and thus an underestimation of the true radius .",
    "* the corot and kepler missions may be particularly susceptible to this contamination in their search for terrestrial - sized planets .",
    "* image deconvolution coupled with high - spatial resolution imaging is a powerful tool for locating and studying many of these annoying neighbours ."
