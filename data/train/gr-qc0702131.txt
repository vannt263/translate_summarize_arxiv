    "the notion of geodesic focusing and the conditions under which it can occur , follow from the well - known analysis of the raychaudhuri equation for the expansion @xmath0 ( see @xcite , @xcite for further details ) .",
    "let us briefly recall this analysis , in order to set the background for further discussion .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation ( for timelike geodesics , assuming shear and rotation to be zero ) is given as :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the tangent vector to the geodesic .",
    "one shows from ( 1 ) that if @xmath3 for some @xmath4 and if @xmath5 , @xmath6 at a _ finite _ value of @xmath7 ( focusing ) .",
    "one may also convert the above equation into a second order form by using @xmath8 . in the second order form ,",
    "one looks for the existence of zeros in @xmath9 at finite @xmath7 , in order to establish the focusing theorem .",
    "the criterion for the existence of zeros follows from the theory of ordinary differential equations of the form : @xmath10 , and is the same as mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph . through the use of the einstein equation in the convergence condition , @xmath11 one arrives at the so called strong energy condition and its variations ( eg . weak , null , dominant energy conditions ) .",
    "physically , focusing implies the rather simple fact that in an attractive gravitational field , the worldlines of test particles tend to converge and ultimately meet .",
    "focusing is therefore a pre  condition on the existence of spacetime singularities @xcite , though it can be completely benign , i.e. just a singularity in the congruence , without there being an actual spacetime singularity at the focal point .",
    "geodesics are _ one dimensional _",
    "surfaces in a given background .",
    "their generalisation to higher dimensional embedded surfaces is provided through the so  called minimal surfaces .",
    "such surfaces arise as the solutions of the variational problem for the area action ( nambu  goto ) .",
    "it is therefore quite likely that the geodesic deviation ( jacobi ) equation and the raychaudhuri equations will also have generalisations for the case of such minimal surfaces .",
    "this was achieved by capovilla and guven in @xcite .",
    "focusing in such a scenario ( i.e. a congruence of surfaces as opposed to a congruence of curves ) is the main topic of discussion in this article . we restrict ourselves to simple examples . in particular , we assume a five dimensional warped background in which we have a four dimensional , timelike embedded surface .",
    "this is the currently fashionable braneworld picture @xcite .",
    "we shall enumerate the various criteria required to obtain results for the focusing of such a congruence of timelike hypersurfaces in a given warped background .    in section",
    "ii , we review the generalised raychaudhuri equations for surface congruences . in section iii , we specialise to 3-branes in a warped five dimensional background and obtain solutions of the generalised equations .",
    "finally in section iv , we provide some remarks and conclude with comments on future directions .",
    "in the case of a family of geodesic curves the quantities that characterise a flow are the expansion ( @xmath0 ) , the rotation ( @xmath12 ) and the shear ( @xmath13 )",
    ". the expansion measures the rate of change of the cross sectional area of a bundle of geodesics .",
    "if it goes to negative infinity within a finite value of the affine parameter , we have focusing .",
    "shearing corresponds to a change of shape ( circle to ellipse , say ) of the cross sectional area and the rotation implies a twist . for families of surfaces ,",
    "these quantities are replaced by a generalised expansion @xmath14 , a generalised shear @xmath15 and a generalised rotation @xmath16 .",
    "the index @xmath17 corresponds to the coordinates of the embedded surface .",
    "thus , we have an expansion , a rotation and a shear along each independent direction on the surface .",
    "it is obvious that these quantities are not independent they are coupled to each other and that is what makes their evolution quite difficult to study .",
    "we shall assume shear and rotation to be zero  this is possible under certain conditions and we take it that they are satisfied .",
    "thus , we have only one equation for the generalised expansion given by @xcite :    @xmath18    where n and d are the dimensions of the background and the embedded surface and    @xmath19    in the above expression @xmath20 constitutes the tangent vector basis chosen such that @xmath21 ( a , b run from 1 to d ) .",
    "@xmath22 are the normals , with @xmath23 ( i , j run from 1 to @xmath24 ) .",
    "also @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 are the @xmath24 extrinsic curvatures ( one along each normal direction ) and @xmath27 is the riemann tensor of the background spacetime . fig .",
    "1 provides a pictorial representation of the embedding in the @xmath28 , @xmath29 case .",
    "one can convert the above equation to a second order form by using @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this yields , finally :    @xmath32    which is a variable mass wave equation on the embedded surface . solving this with appropriate initial conditions",
    "will therefore provide the criteria for focusing .    in an earlier paper @xcite ,",
    "we had arrived at the criterion for focusing of strings ( two dimensional timelike worldsheets , 1branes ) in an arbitrary background .",
    "it turned out that , using a theorem in the theory of partial differential equations , the existence of zeros in @xmath9 seem to be guaranteed if the condition :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the ricci scalar of the worldsheet .    for the case of 3branes in a warped background of five dimensions , @xmath35 and the quantity @xmath36 turns out to be :    @xmath37    if the worldbrane hypersurface is flat then the quantity is further simplified and we have the equation for the expansion taking the form    @xmath38    for background einstein spaces with @xmath39 it is easy to see that the above equation takes the simple form :    @xmath40    we shall now try to analyse the abovementioned equations and look for ways to understand and quantify the notion of focusing of surfaces .",
    "recall that the background five dimensional line element of a warped braneworld model @xcite is given as :    @xmath41    here , @xmath42 is usually referred to as the _ extra _ dimension and the @xmath43 constant slice is a four dimensional timelike hypersurface which is the 3brane and represents our four dimensional world .    assuming the trivial embedding :    @xmath44    with @xmath45 being the coordinates on the 3brane , we find that the tangents and normals take the simple form :    @xmath46    the induced metric on the brane is scaled minkowski , i.e. @xmath47 .    using the ricci tensor components for the background line element ,",
    "it is easy to write down the generalised raychaudhuri ( capovilla  guven ) equations .",
    "we have :    @xmath48    where we have switched back to ( @xmath49 ) as the coordinates on the 3brane ( instead of the ( @xmath50 ) mentioned earlier ) .",
    "normally , one does not _",
    "solve _ a raychaudhuri equation in order to arrive at a focusing theorem .",
    "the usual method is to look for zeros of f at finite values of the parameters ( here @xmath49 ) or analyse the first order equation .",
    "however , the above equation , though a partial differential equation , is simple enough and we may solve it directly to get further insight .",
    "but , to solve the above equation , we do need boundary conditions .",
    "the central question is , where do we impose those conditions ?",
    "let us first try a simple solution of the form :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are constants .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath54 and @xmath55 will be related via a ` dispersion relation ' of the form :    @xmath56    here , it is worth noting that the non  trivial curvature of the five dimensional background makes it appearance only through the above @xmath57 relation .",
    "the geometric stability criteria discussed in @xcite , in addition , implies @xmath58 .",
    "the above solution for @xmath9 would lead to the following expressions for the four expansions @xmath59 .",
    "we have :    @xmath60    one immediately notices a couple of important facts from the above .",
    "\\(i ) assuming an initial condition defined on the 2brane given by the equation @xmath61 one can see that there is a possibility of a divergence to negative infinity ( starting with a finite negative value of @xmath62 ) in @xmath62 as one approaches the 2brane surface @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is however is positive initially and diverges to positive infinite at @xmath63 .",
    "\\(ii ) both @xmath62 and @xmath64 can not simultaneously go to negative infinity because if one assumes a initially negative expansion for one , the other has to be positive and vice versa .",
    "the above discussion can also be carried out assuming the solution for f as @xmath65 .",
    "this will correspond to a time reversed situation .",
    "the general results are similar with reversal of signs at appropriate places . alternatively , assuming a sinusoidal form or a linear combination of sines and cosines does not yield anything newer . in either case",
    ", the point to note is that if we provide _ initial conditions on a 2brane surface _ then the focusing is on the 2brane .    if focusing is defined to be the approach to negative infinity ( at a finite value of the coordinates that define the surface ) of _ all _ the expansion vector components @xmath59 , then we _ do not _ have focusing in this case . in other words , giving initial values on a 2brane does not yield a focusing in the sense defined above .",
    "however , one can also argue that @xmath59 being a vector field on the embedded surface ( here , the 3brane ) the divergence of any one component would correspond to a singularity in the surface congruence .",
    "thus , one may extend the usual notion of a focal point to include _ focal curves _ and _ focal surfaces_. these features are illustrated in figure 1 for the @xmath28 , @xmath29 case .",
    "another worthwhile question to ask is can we have solutions such that ( i ) none of the expansions diverge anywhere ( ii ) all the expansions diverge ( to negative infinity ) somewhere ?",
    "the answer to ( i ) is straightforward .",
    "assume a solution of the form :    @xmath66    this , when substituted in the equation for f , will give a ` dispersion relation ' of the form :    @xmath67    here , we require @xmath68 ( which goes against the criterion of geometric stability discussed in @xcite ) in order to have anything meaningful .",
    "furthermore , we need @xmath69 . with these assumptions ( if at all permissible ) one can show that the expansions are all proportional to @xmath70 and , therefore , they are all finite everywhere .",
    "the answer to the second issue ( ii ) is somewhat more involved . to see this ,",
    "let us assume a solution in the form :    @xmath71    this will yield ordinary differential equations of the form :    @xmath72    if @xmath73 and @xmath58 , then both the solutions can be oscillatory and , typically , we have :    @xmath74 \\\\ \\theta_{(x , y , z ) } = -k_{(x , y , z)}\\tan \\left [ { \\vec k}.{\\vec x } + \\phi_1\\right ] \\\\ \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{4f''(\\sigma_0)e^{2f(\\sigma_0)}+\\omega^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from the above , it is apparent that if we impose an initially negative expansion at some @xmath75 and on @xmath76 we can have all expansions going to negative infinity at finite values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the focal surface , in this case would be spacelike and two dimensional .",
    "one can go further and assume solutions of the form :    @xmath79    or ,    @xmath80    in the first of these , one finds a focal curve ( one dimensional ) and the final one we have a focal point ( zero dimensional ) .",
    "let us evaluate the expansions for the latter .",
    "these turn out to be :    @xmath81    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are appropriate separation constants .",
    "it is easy to see that in the above expressions for @xmath59 one _ can not _ have all of them going to negative infinity even if we asuume all of them to be initially negative .",
    "in fact , one of the components ( here @xmath87 ) never diverges .",
    "thus , providing a initially negative expansion vector field ( at a given point ) can lead to a focusing at a point though all the expansion coefficients will not diverge there .",
    "thus , the important lesson we have learnt is that the notion of focusing of surfaces is quite different ( as it should be ! ) from the case of geodesic curves .",
    "the main difference arises because of the fact that there are several coordinates ( parameters ) that define a surface as opposed to the single parameter that is required to define a curve .",
    "the expansion , is thus a vector field defined on the surface and the divergence of its components at some value or set of values would indicate focusing .",
    "the notion of focusing along a special submanifold ( as illustrated above ) depends on where ( i.e. on which submanifold ) we impose the initial condition .",
    "we have also noted that all components of the vector field may not diverge to negative infinity .    in the above example",
    ", we assumed that the induced metric on the brane is flat .",
    "if this is not the case , then there are bound to be further complications .",
    "for instance , one can think of two scenarios : ( a ) an induced , static spherically symmetric metric on the brane ( b ) an induced cosmological metric . in both these cases , the equation for the quantity f would change drastically through the wave operator defined on the curved submanifold and also through the intrinsic curvature of the induced metric .",
    "the general point made in this article about the role of where we impose initial conditions and the possibility of focusing along all possible lower dimensional submanifolds however remains unaltered , though explicit solutions will surely be very different .    finally , it is useful to try and see what can be said about focusing by looking at the first order equation quoted at the beginning of the paper . at a general level ,",
    "if one assumes @xmath88 then we have    @xmath89    more specifically , for the warped background with a trivially embedded 3brane ( the context we have been discussing here ) , the first order equation gives :    @xmath90    the standard analysis for geodesic focusing can be utilised for the above equation provided we assume that the r.h.s of the above equation is _",
    "negative_. if such is the case , then we can say that @xmath91 will go to negative infinity within a finite value of the parameter @xmath77 .",
    "we can not , however , say anything concrete about the behaviour of the other @xmath92 except that they should be such that the full r. h.s . of the above equation",
    "is negative .",
    "let us now conclude with a summary of the results obtained .",
    "@xmath93 in a warped background , a family of embedded branes with an initial expansion vector field , can focus along lower dimensional submanifolds ( timelike or spacelike ) depending on where ( i.e. on which submanifold ) the initial expansions are specified .",
    "@xmath93 ( i ) if the initial expansion vector components are given on a timelike 2brane then the surface congruence will have a future expansion vector with some ( but not all ) of its components diverging to negative infinity .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , a specification of the initial expansion on a two dimensional section of a spacelike hypersurface can give rise to a future expansion vector with all components diverging to negative infinity .",
    "( iii ) finally , specifying initial conditions on a curve ( one dimensional ) or a point ( zero dimensional ) will lead , once again , to a future expansion vector with some of its components diverging to negative infinity .",
    "all of the above could be termed as analogs of the usual geodesic focusing though the situation in ( ii ) is markedly different from the ones in ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "one is tempted to conjecture ( based on the example discussed ) that for a @xmath94 dimensional timelike , embedded hypersurface , all components of the expansion vector can diverge on a @xmath95 dimensional submanifold .    @xmath93",
    "as mentioned before , the above issues change quantitatively if we have curvature on the brane or we have a non  trivial embedding or if we look at euclidean signature induced metrics .",
    "higher codimension branes / surfaces involve further complications due to the presence of more than one normal vector .",
    "a detailed treatment of all the above cases mentioned is a topic of future investigation and will be communicated in due course .",
