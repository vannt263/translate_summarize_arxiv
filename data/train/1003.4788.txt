    "the evaluation of the pairing field in mean field theories like hartree- fock plus bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( hf+bcs ) or hartree - fock- bogoliubov ( hfb ) is a computationally intensive task due to the non - local character of the pairing tensor and the effort is comparable to the one devoted to the evaluation of the exchange field in the hartree fock method .",
    "therefore , zero range pairing interactions are thoroughly used in standard mean field calculations in order to reduce the computational burden ( see ref @xcite for a recent review ) . the price to pay for the use of zero range pairing forces is the introduction of an `` active space '' around the fermi level to cut away the ultraviolet divergences inherent to any contact interaction ( the pairing matrix elements are independent of the momentum transfer in nuclear matter ) .",
    "thus , it is customary to take into account in the gap equation only those single particle levels lying inside a so called `` active window '' around the fermi level and whose ( sharp or soft ) boundaries are defined using reasonable ( but arbitrary ) assumptions .",
    "the boundaries of the window as well as the pairing interaction strength are usually fixed locally but they are usually not allowed to vary as a function of other relevant degrees of freedom like the quadrupole deformation of the nucleus . as a consequence , the impact of the rigid definition of the `` pairing active window '' in some observable magnitudes can be relevant ( see , for instance , @xcite for a discussion on the impact of the window s size on fission barriers ) . from this perspective , the use of finite range pairing forces seems to be quite unavoidable and this is a common argument to praise the use of gogny type interactions @xcite in hfb or hf+bcs like mean field calculations @xcite .",
    "it has to be mentioned that a renormalization scheme for the phenomenological contact pairing interactions has been proposed in refs @xcite to cure the `` active window '' problem .",
    "recently , proposals to use as pairing interaction in finite nuclei a realistic finite range two body bare interaction @xcite or a low momentum evolved version of it @xcite have been discussed in the literature : the essence of the proposals is to introduce a separable interaction in momentum representation @xcite that is used to fit the realistic interaction ( or a low momentum evolved version of it ) by resorting to fitting protocols involving nucleon - nucleon phase shifts or pairing gaps in nuclear matter . as a consequence of the separable character in momentum space the force is non - local in real space but in a way that simplifies the evaluation of the matrix elements needed for finite nuclei calculations @xcite .",
    "separable interactions were also used as a way to tackle the solution of the lippman - schwinger equation for the @xmath0 operator with realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials @xcite .",
    "recently , a separable form in momentum space of the pairing interaction of a gaussian two body force ( as in the gogny force ) has been proposed @xcite as an alternative to more standard approaches based on zero range contact pairing interactions . as the approximation relies on the same ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite a non - local form of the approximate interaction in real space is obtained .",
    "the non locality of the interaction suggests the introduction of the talmi - brody - moshinsky transformation @xcite to center of mass and relative coordinate to simplify the evaluation of the pairing matrix elements in the harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "explicit expression for the matrix elements are given in @xcite for an harmonic oscillator basis with spherical quantum numbers and a gaussian interaction .",
    "next , it has been shown that this new form is consistent with the rpa framework @xcite .",
    "finally , the scheme has been extended @xcite to the case of a harmonic oscillator basis with axial quantum numbers .",
    "the extension to the case of a harmonic oscillator basis with triaxial quantum numbers is straightforward . in the present article",
    "i show that the transformation to center of mass and relative coordinates can be used for general two body interactions to obtain a kind of separable expression for the pairing two body matrix elements which involves the one body matrix elements of the interaction for the relative coordinate wave functions .",
    "the use of the spectral representation of this interaction matrix leads to a more explicit separable form of the kind considered in @xcite . by using two specific examples in one dimension",
    "it is shown that the number of separable terms in the expansion can be severely cut down for short range interactions .",
    "the validity of the expansion concerning ultraviolet divergences is also discussed .",
    "finally , computational schemes to deal with the yukawa ( and coulomb ! ) potential are discussed .",
    "it has to be stressed that the present approach is not limited to pairing matrix elements and can easily be extended to deal with the exchange matrix elements required for the evaluation of the fock potential and therefore it could be used as an approximation scheme to shorten the numerical burden of hfb calculations with finite range forces like gogny @xcite , other recent proposals based on the yukawa potential @xcite and even the coulomb potential .",
    "let us consider the ( not antisymmetrized ) two - body matrix element @xmath1 for harmonic oscillator ( ho ) wave functions @xmath2 ( this is not a fundamental restriction as more general single particle wave functions can always be expanded in a ho basis ) . taking into account",
    "that at the end we will be folding this matrix elements with a matrix ( either the pairing tensor or the density for the exchange potential ) with indexes @xmath3 and @xmath4 the best approach for the evaluation of this matrix element is that of talmi @xcite and brody - moshinsky @xcite ( see also @xcite for a general discussion ) . within this method ,",
    "the product of ho single particle wave functions with different arguments @xmath5 is expanded in terms of suitable center of mass @xmath6 and relative coordinate @xmath7 wave functions ( this unusual definition of the center of mass and relative coordinate renders some of the expressions simpler than with the usual definition)@xmath8 the center of mass and relative coordinate wave functions have the same structural form as the original wave functions and the expansion is finite ( the range of values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is finite ! ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the special structure of the ho wave functions ( the product of a gaussian times a polynomial ) .",
    "apart from the ho , this peculiarity is only preserved in the case of plane waves and the developments considered below can be extended easily to this case too .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath11 are referred to as talmi - brody - moshinsky @xcite coefficients ( tbmc ) .",
    "the tbmc have a selection rule that will help to reduce the number of final separable terms , it is @xmath12 ( see appendix a for the general expression and selection rules in the one - dimensional case ) which implies that only one of the two sums in eq .",

    "it is worth mentioning that this procedure can be straightforwardly extended to the evaluation of the exchange field by introducing the new tbmc as @xmath30 to obtain@xmath31 which can be used for the evaluation of the exchange field .",
    "this possibility has not been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the drawback of the ( still exact ) separable expansion being considered is that the number of terms involved is enormous unless some property of the interaction is invoked to restrict it .",
    "to do so , we can use the general ideas of linear algebra on how to approximate an arbitrary matrix in terms of low rank kronecker tensor products ( see @xcite for an introduction to the subject ) to justify the rank one approximation @xmath32 where @xmath33 and we are assuming that the @xmath34 term in eq .",

    "( [ eq : l0order ] ) is expected to be accurate enough by considering only a limited number of terms .    in order to get a deeper insight into the number of separable terms in the preceding expansion for the zero range force we will focus on the one - dimensional case",

    "the more realistic three - dimensional case can be elucidated from the results obtained here as , in that case , the matrix elements are the product of the one - dimensional ones along each of the three spatial dimensions .",
    "in addition , the zero range interaction results can be recovered in the limit @xmath59 providing further insight into the number of terms to be retained as well as potential problems with ultraviolet divergences . the one - dimensional ho wave functions will be denoted as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the polynomial part of the ho wave function given by the product of the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath10 times the normalization constant of the 1d ho wave function . the quantity to evaluate is @xmath62 this integral can be carried out in many different ways but for our purposes it is better to use the transformation matrix @xmath63 connecting @xmath64 with @xmath65@xmath66 defined in appendix b , to write@xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "it is better to write the preceding result as @xmath69 to make explicit the dependence in the range of the gaussian @xmath58 .",
    "although this expression is not an explicit power expansion in @xmath70 due to the dependence of @xmath71 on this parameter , it is close to be so because because the ratio between the @xmath72 term of the sum and the @xmath73 one is given by @xmath74 that shows a dominant @xmath75 behavior .",
    "as @xmath70 typically goes as @xmath76 we can conclude that eq ( [ eq : vnngauss ] ) is a kind of expansion on the range of the interaction @xmath58 .",
