    "following the pioneering discovery of the feigenbaum - coullet - tresser period doubling universality in unimodal maps @xcite , @xcite , @xcite universality has been demonstrated to be a rather generic phenomenon in dynamics .    to prove universality one usually introduces a _ renormalization _",
    "operator on a functional space , and demonstrates that this operator has a hyperbolic fixed point .    such renormalization approach to universality has been very successful in one - dimensional dynamics , and has led to explanation of universality in unimodal maps @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , critical circle maps @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and holomorphic maps with a siegel disk @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "universality has been abundantly observed in higher dimensions , in particular , in two and more dimensional dissipative systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , in area - preserving maps , both as the period - doubling universality @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and as the universality associated with the break - up of invariant surfaces @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and in hamiltonian flows @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it has been established that the universal behaviour in dissipative and conservative higher dimensional systems is fundamentally different .",
    "the case of the dissipative systems is often reducible to the one - dimensional feigenbaum - coullet - tresser universality ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "universality for highly dissipative hnon like maps @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a unimodal map , @xmath11 - sufficiently small together with its derivatives , has been demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that these maps are in the feigenbaum - coullet - tresser universality class , and that the degenerate map @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the feigenbaum - coullet - tresser fixed point , is a renormalization fixed point in that class .",
    "the authors of @xcite have also constructed a cantor set ( an attractor ) for infinitely renormalizable maps , and demonstrated that for such hnon - like maps universality coexists with non - rigidity : the hlder exponent of the conjugacy between the actions of any two infinitely renormalizable maps with nonequal average jacobians on their cantor sets has an upper bound less than @xmath14 .",
    "the case of area - preserving maps seems to be very different , and at present there is no deep understanding of universality in conservative systems , other than in the `` trivial '' case of the universality for systems `` near integrability '' @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an infinite period - doubling cascade in families of area - preserving maps was observed by several authors in early 80 s @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the period - doubling phenomenon can be illustrated with the area - preserving h ' enon family ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath15    maps @xmath16 have a fixed point @xmath17 which is stable for @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath19 this fixed point becomes unstable , at the same time an orbit of period two is born with @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "this orbit , in turn , becomes unstable at @xmath22 , giving birth to a period @xmath23 stable orbit .",
    "generally , there exists a sequence of parameter values @xmath24 , at which the orbit of period @xmath25 turns unstable , while at the same time a stable orbit of period @xmath26 is born .",
    "the parameter values @xmath24 accumulate on some @xmath27 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the accumulation rate @xmath28 is universal for a large class of families , not necessarily hnon .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath26 periodic orbits scale asymptotically with two scaling parameters @xmath29    to explain how orbits scale with @xmath30 and @xmath31 we will follow @xcite . consider an interval @xmath32 of parameter values in a `` typical '' family @xmath33 . for any value @xmath34 the map @xmath35 possesses a stable periodic orbit of period @xmath36 .",
    "we fix some @xmath37 within the interval @xmath32 in some consistent way ; for instance , by requiring that the restriction of @xmath38 to a neighbourhood of a stable periodic point in the @xmath36-periodic orbit is conjugate , via a diffeomorphism @xmath39 , to a rotation with some fixed rotation number @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be some unstable periodic point in the @xmath25-periodic orbit , and let @xmath42 be the further of the two stable @xmath36-periodic points that bifurcated from @xmath41 . denote with @xmath43 , the distance between @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "the new elliptic point @xmath42 is surrounded by invariant ellipses ; let @xmath44 be the distance between @xmath42 and @xmath41 in the direction of the minor semi - axis of an invariant ellipse surrounding @xmath42 , see figure [ bifgeom ] .",
    "then , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ratio of the smaller and larger eigenvalues of @xmath47 .",
    "this universality can be explained rigorously if one shows that the _ renormalization _ operator @xmath48=\\lambda^{-1}_f \\circ f \\circ f \\circ \\lambda_f,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is some @xmath50-dependent coordinate transformation , has a fixed point , and the derivative of this operator is hyperbolic at this fixed point .    it has been argued in @xcite that @xmath49 is a diagonal linear transformation . furthermore , such @xmath49 has been used in @xcite and @xcite in a computer assisted proof of existence of a reversible renormalization fixed point @xmath1 and hyperbolicity of the operator @xmath51 .",
    "an exploration of a possible analytic machinery has been undertaken in @xcite where it has been demonstrated that the fixed point @xmath1 is very close , in some appropriate sense , to an area - preserving hnon - like map @xmath52 where @xmath53 solves the following one - dimensional problem of non - feigenbaum type : @xmath54    in this paper we will study the dynamics of the renormalization fixed point @xmath1 and maps in some neighbourhood of @xmath1 .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the preservation of area for such maps leads to one important difference between the case at hand and the highly dissipative case of hnon - like maps : the former maps have no obvious invariant subsets in their domain . in particular , this means , that the construction of invariant cantor sets carried out in @xcite , which is using existence of invariant subsets in a crucial way , is not readily applicable to the case of area - preserving maps .    to construct hyperbolic sets",
    ", we will use the idea of covering relations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) in rigorous computations .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the hyperbolic sets will be estimated with the help of the duarte distortion theorem ( see , e.g. @xcite ) which enables one to use the distortion of a cantor set to ultimately find bounds on the dimension .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : we begin by recalling the basic properties of area - preserving reversible maps in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we introduce some notation and recall some standard definitions from hyperbolic dynamics . in section 4",
    "we study the domain of analyticity of maps in a neighbourhood of the renormalization fixed point , and analytic continuation of the renormalization fixed point .",
    "section 5 consists of the statements of our main theorems . in section 6",
    ", we recall the definition and the main properties of the covering relations .",
    "in section 7 we prove that any area - preserving reversible map in a neighbourhood of the renormalization fixed point has a transversal homoclinic orbit in its domain of analyticity . in section 8",
    "we construct a heteroclinic tangle for the renormalization fixed point . from its existence the existence of unbounded , and oscillating trajectories follow . in section 9",
    "we recall the duarte distortion theorem . in sections 10 and 11",
    "we pr ove that the third iterate of any area - preserving reversible map in a neighbourhood of the renormalization fixed point has a horseshoe , and compute bounds on its hausdorff dimension using the duarte distortion theorem . in a satellite paper @xcite",
    ", we prove that _ infinitely renormalizable _ maps in the neighbourhood of existence of the hyperbolic set for the third iterate also admit a `` stable '' set .",
    "this set is a bounded invariant set , such that the maximal lyapunov exponent for the third iterate is zero . in @xcite",
    "we provide an upper bound on the hausdorff dimension of the stable set , and prove that the hausdorff dimension is constant for all maps in some subset of infinitely renormalizable maps .",
    "an `` area - preserving map '' will mean an exact symplectic diffeomorphism of a subset of @xmath0 onto its image .",
    "recall , that an area - preserving map can be uniquely specified by its generating function @xmath55 : @xmath56    furthermore , we will assume that @xmath50 is reversible , that is @xmath57    for such maps it follows from @xmath58 that @xmath59    and @xmath60    it is this `` little '' @xmath61 that will be referred to below as `` the generating function '' .",
