    "in high-@xmath6 cuprates , the conducting state develops gradually as the parent antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator is doped with charge carriers.@xcite at a certain point of this transformation the superconductivity ( sc ) sets in , which happens long before such remnants of the af insulating state as af correlations and a pseudogap in the electron density of states are completely wiped out.@xcite despite the decades of intensive research , however , detail mechanisms of the insulator - metal transformation and , in particular , the role of af correlations therein remain unclear . from the experimental point of view , the difficulty stems from the very strong exchange interaction in cuo@xmath2 planes , @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9ev,@xcite which makes the af correlations robust to high temperatures and magnetic fields and leaves no means of `` switching '' them off . for compositions on either side of the insulator - superconductor transformation , two - dimensional ( 2d ) af correlations",

    "as the temperature decreases , the spin correlations smoothly develop until  depending on the doping level  establishing a long - range af order at the nel temperature @xmath13 , forming a static of fluctuating `` stripe '' structure , or freezing into a `` cluster spin glass''.@xcite this evolution being spread over a wide temperature range makes it hard to clarify whether and how the spin textures emerging in cuo@xmath2 planes affect the charge motion .",
    "in contrast to the gradual development of 2d af correlations within the cuo@xmath2 planes , the spin ordering along the @xmath0 axis  if it takes place at all  occurs in a dramatically compressed temperature interval .",
    "owing to the strong anisotropy of exchange interactions , the @xmath0-axis spin correlation length @xmath14 stays shorter than the interplane distance until the 3d ordering temperature @xmath13 is closely approached.@xcite only in the vicinity of @xmath13 , @xmath14 reaches the unit - cell size , causing a 2d3d crossover in af correlations , and then diverges sharply .",
    "in fact , it is this abrupt spin ordering along the @xmath0 direction that allows the af transition to show up in macroscopic properties of lightly doped cuprates . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals",
    "( @xmath1 is a rare earth element ) , for instance , the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath15 exhibits a steep increase below @xmath13 , though @xmath16 stays perfectly smooth through @xmath13.@xcite hence , although af correlations within cuo@xmath2 planes are hard to affect , the abrupt af ordering along the @xmath0 axis opens a possibility to compare the electron transport _ with _ and completely _ without _ spin order along one of the directions , thus clarifying the transport mechanisms and the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity .    in this paper , we report a @xmath0-axis magnetoresistance ( mr ) study of luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( lu-123 ) and yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( y-123 ) single crystals with doping levels spanning the range of the af - sc transformation . sharp af transitions observed in crystals even with low @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19k have allowed us to map precisely the phase diagram and to single out the impact of spin ordering on the @xmath0-axis charge transport .",
    "we find that in the doping region of the af - sc transformation the ( lu , y)-123 crystals exhibit a 3d metallic conduction until the sc or af ordering intervenes at low temperatures .",
    "the nel ordering appears to compete with sc by strongly inhibiting the charge motion , yet nevertheless the two orders coexist in a certain range of hole doping .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic field is found to interfere with both orders , suppressing the superconductivity and stabilizing the static af order .",
    "@xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals with non - magnetic rare - earth elements @xmath1@xmath5lu and y were grown by the flux method and their oxygen stoichiometry was tuned to the required level by subsequent high - temperature annealing and quenching.@xcite given the complex distribution of structural defects along the @xmath0 axis in flux - grown crystals,@xcite part of the crystals were cut and polished to select better pieces for measurements .",
    "we confirmed also that no oxygen - enriched layer was formed at the crystal surface upon quenching ; namely , one of the crystals was dissolved in acid in several steps , each step being preceded with resistivity measurements , yet no considerable change in the sc transition was observed .",
    "after the doping level of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals was roughly set by changing the oxygen content @xmath20 , the hole density in cuo@xmath2 planes @xmath21 was further reversibly tuned using the well studied phenomenon of chain - layer oxygen ordering : heating the crystal above 100 - 120@xmath22c with subsequent quenching reduced the hole density in cuo@xmath2 planes by up to @xmath23 , while room - temperature aging gradually restored it back without any change in stoichiometry.@xcite for characterizing the doping state of crystals we have selected the in - plane conductivity @xmath24k@xmath25 .",
    "the latter is a good measure of the hole density given that the hole mobility stays almost constant in the doping region under investigation.@xcite the particular temperature @xmath10@xmath26@xmath27k is taken to be high enough to reduce the impact of impurity scattering , yet sufficiently low to avoid oxygen ordering , and thus change in doping , on the time scale of measurements .",
    "it is worth noting that although the in - plane and the @xmath0-axis transport measurements were carried out on separate samples , the samples were cut from the same crystal , and then annealed and handled together to provide an exact match in their states .",
    "the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath15 was measured using the ac four - probe technique with a special care taken to avoid mixing of @xmath28 with the in - plane resistivity @xmath29 . to provide a homogeneous current flow along the @xmath0-axis , two current contacts were painted to",

    "this provides a number of states with different @xmath21 for a given oxygen content @xmath20 , thereby allowing critical regions of the phase diagram to be studied in detail .",
    "we have used this approach to trace how the @xmath0-axis resistivity of luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals evolves with the hole density in the narrow doping region where superconductivity sets in ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "as can be seen , the @xmath15 curves in this heavily underdoped region demonstrate a complicated behavior with a crossover@xcite at 100 - 150 k. at temperatures above the crossover , the @xmath0-axis resistivity smoothly decreases with increasing hole density , and no peculiarity shows up in this smooth evolution at the doping level of the sc onset . the low-@xmath35 resistivity behavior , however , changes remarkably . from the set of _ zero - field _ @xmath15 curves in fig .  1",
    "one can immediately infer that , upon cooling , the crystal either turns into the sc state , or instead exhibits a steep increase in the resistivity . this steep growth in @xmath15 with a characteristic asymmetric negative peak in the derivative ( inset in fig .",
    "1 ) is a hallmark of the nel transition in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4.@xcite the evolution of @xmath15 curves looks therefore like af and sc are competing for carriers and the system falls into one of two possible states , either the insulating af state or the sc one .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that sharp af transitions are observed down to remarkably low @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19k ( inset in fig .",
    "1 ) instead of the freezing into a spin glass usually expected at such temperatures @xcite ; the superconductivity in lu-123 thus develops directly from the af state without any intervening spin - glass region .        one may wonder whether a strong magnetic field will suppress both the af and sc orders and create some intermediate metallic state .",
    "we find , surprisingly , that upon suppressing the superconductivity the field @xmath31@xmath32@xmath33 also recovers the steep increase in @xmath28 associated with the af ordering ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "a study of other crystals has confirmed that as long as the sc is weak enough to be wiped out with the 16.5-t field , be that in lu-123 or y-123 crystals , the obtained normal - state @xmath15 curves demonstrate clear anomalies at 15 - 20@xmath41k associated with the nel transition ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this behavior indicates that either the af and sc orders coexist and the magnetic field simply unveils the resistivity anomaly at @xmath13 hidden by superconductivity , or the af order is frustrated in the sc state but revives as the superconductivity is destroyed .",
    "although the nel transitions in figs .  1 and 2 look rather sharp for transition temperatures reduced by 20 - 25 times from the original @xmath42@xmath43410 - 420  k in parent @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath44,@xcite their width together with insufficient understanding of the interlayer charge transport still introduce a considerable uncertainty in the @xmath13 evaluation . indeed , depending on the mechanisms underlying the observed @xmath0-axis resistivity anomalies , @xmath13 should be taken at the position of the negative peak in the derivative @xmath45 or at the middle of the `` drop '' in @xmath45 preceding the peak .",
    "these two definitions provide @xmath13 values that differ by several k for the curves shown in figs .  1 and 2 . nevertheless , whichever approach in evaluating @xmath13 is selected , the qualitative conclusion on the long - range af order with @xmath17@xmath4615 - 20@xmath41k showing up in low-@xmath6 samples ( fig .",

    "as can be seen , the af phase boundary does not terminate at the onset of superconductivity .",
    "instead , it extends at least up to 30% higher doping , and crosses the @xmath6 line at @xmath46@xmath48k , in contrast to another prototype high-@xmath6 cuprate la@xmath49sr@xmath50cuo@xmath51 where the long - range af order is destroyed long before the sc sets in.@xcite     and @xmath6 normalized by corresponding changes in @xmath52 as observed upon room - temperature aging of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals .",
    "the data are presented as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath6 .",
    "the horizontal bars in the left panel indicate the actual interval of the @xmath13 shift in each experiment.,width=326 ]    an important issue is the reliability of the presented phase diagram , especially given the controversy remaining in publications .",
    "@xcite indeed , the observed sc and af transitions are not very sharp , leaving some room for doubts . besides",
    ", however sharp the transitions might be , a possibility of a peculiar macroscopic inhomogeneity imitating the phase coexistence will still remain . for the oxygen compositions under discussion ,",
    "we have ruled out one possible source of inhomogeneity associated with a phase separation into oxygen - rich and oxygen - poor domains : the behavior of lu-123 crystals quenched from high temperatures , and thus possessing homogeneous oxygen distribution , showed no qualitative difference from that of crystals aged at room temperature for an ultimate 10-years period .    a static cation inhomogeneity over the crystal as a source of the af and sc phase coexistence is , however , hard to rule out by conventional means .",
    "fortunately , in r-123 crystals one has an additional tool to check the phase diagram by employing the hole doping though the oxygen ordering.@xcite in fact , by aging the crystals at room temperature and measuring their conductivity @xmath47 , @xmath6 , and @xmath13 as a function of time , one can evaluate the slops of phase boundaries in the diagram shown in fig .",
    "an important point here is that the relative changes in @xmath6 and @xmath13 observed upon aging are insensitive to static macroscopic inhomogeneities .",
    "the phase - boundary slopes measured in the described way are presented in fig .  4 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath13 ;",
    "this way of the data presentation is selected to avoid any uncertainty related to ill - defined parameters such as the hole density .",
    "as expected , the slope of the sc phase boundary , @xmath53 , gradually increases with decreasing @xmath6 and the superconductivity disappears abruptly at a critical doping .",
    "the behavior of the af boundary is much different ; initially it indeed becomes steeper with increasing doping and decreasing @xmath13 , but then the slop of the @xmath13 line decreases dramatically , tending to zero at zero @xmath13 .",
    "this flattening unambiguously confirms the intrinsic origin of the af - order tail entering the sc region in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "3 .     illustrating the additional low-@xmath35 resistivity caused by the af ordering and the impact of the magnetic field @xmath31@xmath32@xmath33 on both @xmath13 and @xmath28 .",
    "two sets of curves for @xmath20@xmath540.36 correspond to the quenched and partially aged states of the crystal . low-@xmath35 magnetoresistance data for the quenched @xmath20@xmath540.36 sample are shown in the inset.,width=291 ]    what still remains to be clarified is whether the af and sc orders actually coexist in their overlapping region on the phase diagram , or the af order is restored by the magnetic field upon destroying the superconductivity . the latter is not completely impossible given that the magnetic field is found to inhibit the hole motion and to stabilize the nel order even in non - sc @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "one can see that the nel temperature indicated in the plot by an arrow , increases by @xmath552 - 3  k under 16.5-t field @xmath56@xmath32@xmath33 . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding resistivity upturn also starts from higher temperatures , which causes a significant magnetoresistance @xmath57 reaching @xmath18@xmath58 at low @xmath35 ( inset in fig .  5 ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that the resistivity measurements are incapable of providing information on @xmath13 values within the sc state and the data points in fig .",
    "3 located inside the sc region were obtained after the sc was killed by the 16.5-t magnetic field .",
    "if the field - induced increase of @xmath13 in the sc region is two - three times larger than in non - sc ones , the true magnetic state underlying the superconductivity in @xmath1 - 123 may well be a `` cluster spin glass '' which is driven to a long - range af order only with the sc suppression .       upon changing the nel temperature .",
    "the data were obtained on the same luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystal at @xmath20@xmath540.36 , in the quenched ( left panel ) and partially aged ( middle panel ) states , and at @xmath20@xmath590.38 in the quenched state ( right panel).,width=326 ]    after establishing the phase diagram , we can consider what is the `` normal state '' ( at @xmath10@xmath60@xmath13 , @xmath6 ) that both the af and sc orders originate from , and how it is affected by the af ordering . at a first glance",
    ", the long - range antiferromagnetism just localizes the doped holes , thus strictly opposing the superconductivity ( figs .  1 and 5 ) .",
    "however , there exists a narrow doping range on the phase diagram in fig .  3 where the superconductivity sets in at @xmath10@xmath61@xmath13 ( see also figs .  1 and 2 ) , which raises additional questions concerning the mechanism of hole transport in the af state .",
    "in particular , does the @xmath0-axis transport actually acquire an activated character with establishing the long - range af order ?",
    "if the af - ordered state is inevitably an insulator with an appreciable energy gap , how does the superconductivity emerge at @xmath62@xmath61@xmath13 ?",
    "the simplest way of evaluating the activation energy is to plot the derivative @xmath63 which gives a @xmath35-independent @xmath64 for ordinary activation behavior @xmath65 or an effective gap @xmath66 for variable range hopping @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast to expectations , the derivative data in fig .  6 show a clear positive curvature ( @xmath68@xmath610 ) in the entire temperature region below @xmath13 , which is inconsistent with a simple activated transport .",
    "the af ordering therefore inhibits the hole motion , causing a sharp kink at @xmath13 , but does not immediately turn the system into an insulator . with further reduction of the carrier density and increase of @xmath13 above 50 - 100  k",
    ", the hole motion indeed switches to the hopping regime,@xcite yet in the low-@xmath13 region shown in figs .  5 and 6 the quasi - metallic conduction survives , leaving some room for superconductivity .",
    "strictly speaking , a possibility that the resistivity even in low-@xmath13 crystals in figs .  5 and 6",
    "will acquire an insulating behavior in the sub - kelvin region still remains , but the corresponding insulating gap in that case would be too small to affect the occurrence of superconductivity .",
    "the derivative plots in fig .",
    "6 have other important implications .",
    "first , all the derivatives @xmath69 at low @xmath35 appear to follow roughly the same curve until breaking down at @xmath13 .",
    "the same low-@xmath35 resistivity behavior is observed even in superconducting crystals after suppressing sc with magnetic field ( right panel ) . the @xmath0-axis transport mechanism in the spin ordered state is therefore kept unchanged in the critical doping range of the af - sc transformation ; what changes with doping and magnetic field is merely the nel temperature ( fig .",
    "second , the @xmath15 upturn at low @xmath35marked by the positive sign of the derivative in fig .  6is solely , or at least predominantly caused by the af ordering .",
    "as the spin order melts above @xmath13 , the resistivity quickly switches to the metallic behavior [ negative sign of @xmath69 ] . with decreasing @xmath13",
    "the region of the resistivity upturn shrinks with a clear tendency to vanish completely for @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath72 limit ( if it could be reached without getting into the sc state ) the @xmath0-axis resistivity would keep the metal - like behavior down to low @xmath35 , slowly decreasing and approaching a constant value at zero temperature .",
    "the obtained data indicate that , in the absence of the interplane af order , the charge carriers in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 can move along the @xmath0 axis without thermal activation .",
    "regardless of whether the non - activated interlayer conduction occurs through a coherent , metallic transport or by an energy - conserving tunneling , it requires itinerant quasiparticles to be already formed in cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "the latter in turn implies the in - plane charge transport in the non - af - ordered state to be invariably metallic as well .",
    "indeed , the in - plane resistivity @xmath16 was reported to exhibit a metallic behavior without any upturn until entering the nel state.@xcite consequently , the `` normal state '' playing a role of a starting point for the af - sc phase competition in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 is an anisotropic 3d metal that experiences the impact of sc and af ordering upon lowering the temperature .",
    "by now , many theoretical approaches have been suggested to describe the frustration that the doped holes introduce to the spin system and the resulting suppression of the long - range af order.@xcite namely , the doped holes were proposed to switch the exchange interaction between the nearest cu spins from antiferro- to ferromagnetic while being localized,@xcite or to continuously break the af bonds while moving by the nearest - neighbor hopping.@xcite spin distortions accompanying the doped holes are not restricted to the nearest cu ions , but spread for several unit cells away and may form spin polarons , 2d spin vortices,@xcite spin spirals,@xcite af domain walls,@xcite or complex spin textures controlled by the distribution of the dopants.@xcite whatever the case , upon increasing the hole density , the resulting spin distortions are suggested to gradually reduce the average staggered magnetization in each cuo@xmath2 plane to zero , thereby making impossible the interlayer spin ordering and hence the long - range af order .    while the mentioned above theoretical approaches have been positively tested on the prototype high-@xmath6 cuprate la@xmath49sr@xmath50cuo@xmath51 , the considerably different behavior of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 may call for reconsidering the impact of doped holes on the long - range af order .",
    "indeed , the af state in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 survives up to 2 - 3 times higher hole concentrations than in la@xmath49sr@xmath50cuo@xmath51 , pointing to a significant material dependence of the af - order suppression .",
    "furthermore , the low-@xmath13 tail of the af order spreading in the phase diagram towards sc compositions ( fig .",
    "3 ) is hard to explain in the framework of those approaches , since they predict no slowing down of the spin frustration with increasing doping .",
    "one more difficulty for the existing models is the sharp af transitions observed down to low @xmath13 s , which are hard to reconcile with strongly frustrated spin states and disordered spin textures in cuo@xmath2 planes suggested to emerge with doping.@xcite    nevertheless , most of the observed features may be qualitatively accounted for by assuming the doped holes to break the long - range af order in cuo@xmath2 planes into 2d domains .",
    "@xcite indeed , since the nel temperature in that case should be determined by the interlayer spin coupling integrated over an average domain,@xcite a gradual reduction of the domain size with doping can explain why @xmath13 approaches zero value slowly and smoothly instead of vanishing abruptly ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that the interlayer coupling in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 is not frustrated @xcite in contrast to la@xmath49sr@xmath50cuo@xmath51,@xcite and thus should allow the nel order in the former to survive up to much higher doping .",
    "the idea of moving holes frustrating the af order implies a reverse impact as well , which makes the origin of the observed antiferromagnetism - induced hole localization intuitively clear .",
    "as the penalty for frustrating the af bonds exceeds the kinetic energy of a doped hole , the hole should get trapped by the environment . while in cuo@xmath2 planes the hole hopping to the nearest - neighbor sites is inhibited smoothly @xcite due to the gradual development of af correlations , the suppression of the @xmath0-axis hole hopping should occur abruptly with the @xmath0-axis spin ordering at @xmath13 , exactly as observed experimentally .",
    "however a question remains : when exactly does the charge transport switch its character from metallic to non - metallic , i.e. thermally - activated hopping ?",
    "a comparison of the @xmath0-axis conductivity for the cases of spins being or being not af ordered along that axis has demonstrated that in the absence of spin order the holes move without thermal activation .",
    "therefore , the `` normal state '' in the af - sc transformation region ( at temperatures above @xmath13 , @xmath6 ) is certainly a 3d metal .",
    "as the af order develops , the holes are driven to localization , yet the exact position of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) remains unsettled .",
    "previous attempts to determine the mit location on the phase diagram of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 employed both the charge - transport and heat - transport measurements , yet resulted in somewhat controversial conclusions ; namely , the mit was suggested to occur at hole densities lower , equal , or even higher than the sc onset ( see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "is there a universal doping level for mit in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 at all ?",
    "an important result following from the present study is that the metal - insulator transformation is largely driven by the af spin ordering . given that the af correlations in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 are not determined solely by the hole density , but develop with decreasing temperature , get stabilized by magnetic fields and , presumably , depend on some material parameters , there is little reason to expect the mit to be located on the phase diagram at some universal hole density .",
    "instead , the metal - insulator transformation may take place depending on doping , magnetic field , material parameters , and , in a sense , even on temperature .",
    "the latter means that the hole localization gains strength on cooling due to the development of the af order and thus the metal - insulator border may be crossed at some transition temperature.@xcite    what still remains to be understood is how the magnetic field enters the af - sc interplay .",
    "one possibility is that the magnetic field affects both orders almost independently , suppressing superconductivity and stabilizing the long - range af state .",
    "indeed , a magnetic field applied to a 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet can introduce an anisotropy to the spin system , thus suppressing the spin fluctuations and allowing the long - range nel order to be established .",
    "alternatively , the af and sc ground states may be separated by a first - order transition , as were predicted , for instance , in the so(5 ) theory , @xcite and the magnetic field may directly affect their competition .",
    "microscopic probes capable of detecting the af order inside the superconducting state are indispensable for this issue to be clarified .",
