    "the linear response of equilibrium systems to a time - dependent shift in the energy has been extensively studied throughout the twentieth century .",
    "it is an important question in the construction of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to find suitable extensions , most interestingly with a systematic physical interpretation .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to such a programme @xcite , and the present paper is contributing a second part to what we believe is a unifying and yet novel approach to the subject . in the previous part  i",
    "@xcite we have shown how to think of this extension for markov jump processes and for overdamped diffusions . in the present continuation we deal with more general processes including underdamped diffusions .",
    "their state space contains both position and momentum degrees of freedom and hence there are important changes with respect to the analysis in part  i , mostly having to do with the nature of time - reversal and dissipation . for inertial systems the time - reversal includes changing the sign of the momenta , which are the variables connected with energy dissipation , as this is power lost by the frictional forces exerted on momenta .",
    "more generally , the hamiltonian structure adds some nontrivial aspects to the analysis .",
    "nevertheless the strategy with its statistical interpretation holds basically unchanged .",
    "the response formula gives the generalized susceptibilities for changes in the potential @xmath0 depending on time @xmath1 in a quantity @xmath2 at time @xmath3 in the form  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the history , @xmath6 is the path - dependent excess in entropy flux and @xmath7 is the path - dependent excess in dynamical activity to linear order in @xmath8 , called frenesy  @xcite .",
    "excess refers to the perturbation @xmath9 .",
    "the brackets @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote expectations in the unperturbed and perturbed process , respectively .",
    "the structure is thus similar to that in equilibrium , with responses written in term of correlations estimated in the unperturbed regime . before giving the general explanations , we start with an example , an inertial brownian motion under nonequilibrium driving .",
    "we consider a particle with momentum and position @xmath12 undergoing @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the friction by the heat bath at inverse temperature @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a standard white noise . with a sufficiently confining potential @xmath18 , a stationary distribution @xmath19 settles for a nonequilibrium due to the presence of a non - gradient force @xmath20 .",
    "the perturbation is in the form of a constant external field @xmath21 with amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "we look at the excesses , first in entropy flux : for a path @xmath5 during @xmath23 $ ] , @xmath24 is the excess entropy flux by the field @xmath21 ( heat transmitted to the reservoir divided by the temperature , taking boltzmann s constant equal to one ) .",
    "secondly we must identify the path - dependent frenesy , that is , the linear order ( in @xmath25 ) in the excess of dynamical activity or generalized escape rate .",
    "we give it here without further explanation to return to it in sections [ ii ] and [ under ] .",
    "for the present example it is given by @xmath26\\cdot e\\ ] ] where in the square brackets and from one discovers the thermostating forces for the original dynamics , friction plus forcing from the heat bath : @xmath27 observe that @xmath28 is symmetric under time - reversing the paths ( together with flipping the momentum ) .",
    "if for example we take the momentum @xmath29 as the observable for which we seek the linear response , the result is like : @xmath30 or , in differential form , yielding the nonequilibrium dynamic mobility with @xmath31 , @xmath32\\ , p(t)\\right>_\\rho + \\frac{\\beta } { 2\\gamma }    \\frac{{\\textrm{d}}}{{\\textrm{d}}s } \\left < e\\cdot p(s ) \\,p(t ) \\right>_\\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have added the subscript @xmath19 to indicate that we are looking here at the stationary situation , although this is just a standard choice and is not necessary for our approach . in equilibrium , when @xmath20 would itself be a gradient , one has time - reversal invariance and one easily checks that the second line in contributes exactly the same as in the first line , obtaining the standard relation between mobility ( left - hand side ) and diffusion @xmath33 in terms of momentum correlations .",
    "this example , the nonequilibrium relation between mobility and diffusivity , has been visited already by various groups including @xcite containing various and different useful response relations",
    ". we will revisit it as example [ ein ] .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explain the general algorithm for identifying the terms in resulting e.g. in and to add the statistical dynamical meaning . in the next section",
    "we explain the general strategy on the level of path - space distributions .",
    "section [ under ] fills in the details for inertial diffusions as in the example above . in section [ inter ]",
    "we connect our formulation with previous ones , in particular those obtained via first order perturbation theory .",
    "finally there are more examples and comparisons in section [ exs ] , including a generalized einstein relation .",
    "we start with an algorithm for arriving at the general linear response formula , outlined in  @xcite .",
    "we suppose variables @xmath12 which trace out some path or trajectory during a time - interval @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "we can think of a hamiltonian flow to which we have added nonequilibrium forces by various contacts with the environment . at the initial time @xmath34 the system is found in a nonequilibrium regime , possibly a steady state .",
    "we are interested in some observation at time @xmath35 when we perturb the hamiltonian by adding @xmath36 , with @xmath37 .",
    "let us also add that what follows is greatly independent of the details of the dynamics .",
    "we compare the perturbed system with the original one yielding a probability density @xmath38 for paths @xmath39 for times @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we assume that this probability density can be written in terms of an action @xmath41 , simply as @xmath42}{\\mbox{prob}[\\omega ] } = e^{-{\\cal a}(\\omega)}\\ ] ] that amounts to supposing @xmath43=0 \\rightarrow \\mbox{prob}^h[\\omega]=0 $ ] .",
    "thus @xmath38 gives the changed plausibility of trajectories @xmath5 on the considered scale of reduced description . in the case of markov dynamics",
    ", @xmath44 is a time - integral .",
    "a natural decomposition of @xmath41 can be made with the time - reversal @xmath45 which changes @xmath5 into @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "then , @xmath48 with @xmath49 the source - term of time - symmetry breaking is @xmath50 and , under typical nonequilibrium conditions , it is exactly the excess in physical entropy flux due to the perturbation . for markov dynamics that is being implemented by the condition of local detailed balance , but it can be more generally derived from mechanical beginnings , see @xcite for derivations starting from a hamiltonian evolution . for constructing markov models",
    "the condition of local detailed balance was emphasized in @xcite and it underlies what is called the fluctuation symmetry for the variable entropy production  @xcite . for the general algorithm ,",
    "if we know the excess entropy flux we know @xmath50 , see as a first example .",
    "the time - symmetric term @xmath51 is an excess in the time - integrated instantaneous dynamical activity .",
    "it was discussed in @xcite for overdamped diffusions and for markov jump processes respectively . by looking at",
    "we see that , of two trajectories having the same entropy flux , the one with the lowest excess in activity is most probable . formally , the dynamical activity in @xmath52 is the rate of escape from that phase space point .",
    "we will see it implemented in section [ under ] for underdamped diffusions . in the first example and as already mentioned there , @xmath53 for random forcing @xmath54 $ ] , with @xmath55 .",
    "clearly then , the response can be calculated from @xmath56 where the right - hand side averages over the unperturbed process .",
    "the created entropy flux is dissipating the extra energy in the environment which is itself of order @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the excess entropy @xmath50 is already linear in @xmath25 .",
    "the dynamical activity can be linearized to @xmath57 and we obtain : @xmath58 which is the same structure of linear response as in @xcite .",
    "we can in fact also consider @xmath59 in from which we see that @xmath60 since in equilibrium there is full time - reversal invariance , we know for the right - hand side of that @xmath61 , due to time - reversal invariance of @xmath28 ( @xmath62 is the sign of @xmath2 upon time - reversal ) .",
    "similarly @xmath63 because @xmath64 is antisymmetric .",
    "hence , by , @xmath65 and we recover from the fluctuation - dissipation relation , @xmath66 for equilibrium , with the standard interpretation that the linear response of a quantity to a perturbation is given by its correlation with the entropy that the perturbation produces . out of equilibrium ,",
    "the second term originating from the dynamical activity @xmath28 , what we like to call the frenetic term , is not reducible to the ( first ) entropic term except for the relation . implementing it in",
    ", we can still write that for all times @xmath67 @xmath68 where the excesses @xmath64 ( in entropy flux ) and @xmath28 ( in activity ) are over the time - interval @xmath23 $ ] , linear in the amplitudes @xmath8 . the second term in the right - hand side of vanishes in equilibrium .",
    "the generic model that adds a specific dynamics to the previous section has states @xmath69 @xmath70 of positions and momenta .",
    "we imagine a weak coupling with equilibrium reservoirs .",
    "that is : at each @xmath71 are attached a standard white noise @xmath72 with diffusion constant @xmath73 and a friction coefficient @xmath74 to model a heat bath at temperature @xmath75 : @xmath76 for a given potential @xmath77 taking care of the coupling and pinning of the positions .",
    "the pinning is also thought to confine the positions to some finite volume . besides the possibility of having multiple temperatures @xmath78 to drive the system away from equilibrium",
    ", we also add a nonconservative forcing @xmath79 .",
    "finally , the perturbation is @xmath80 and thus adds a potential to the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath81 with small time - dependent amplitude @xmath8 for @xmath82 .    alternatively , we can write the fokker - planck equation for the unperturbed system as @xmath83 for @xmath84 and for current @xmath85 with @xmath86 to be understood with diagonal matrices @xmath15 and @xmath73 . the backward generator @xmath87 is @xmath88    let us now apply the algorithm . in a time - interval @xmath23 $ ] the time - integrated entropy flux in excess ( by the perturbation )",
    "is made from the extra heat into the various reservoirs : @xmath89 on the other hand , the excess in dynamical activity is obtained by checking the excess action @xmath41 of the previous section and linearizing the time - symmetric part : @xmath90\\ ] ] the last stochastic integral ( there is no difference here between the it and the stratonovich conventions ) can still be worked out when inserting @xmath28 in the correlation function ( second term in ) .",
    "we get @xmath91 for an arbitrary starting density @xmath92 . as a consequence",
    "the total linear response function for the underdamped diffusion model is @xmath93 with @xmath94\\,q(t ) \\rangle_\\mu\\\\ & & - \\frac{{\\textrm{d}}}{{\\textrm{d}}s } \\sum_i \\langle \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial q_i}(q(s ) ) \\ , p_i(s)\\,q(t)\\rangle_\\mu + \\sum_{i , j } \\langle \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial q_j\\partial q_i}(q(s ) ) \\,p_j(s)\\,p_i(s)\\,q(t)\\rangle_\\mu\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that all the observables ( within the expectations ) are explicitly known .",
    "the formula remains valid whether @xmath95 ( stationary regime ) or otherwise ( transient regime ) .",
    "some specific examples follow in section [ exs ] .",
    "linear response is first order perturbation theory and here we assume smooth behavior .",
    "we could therefore also set up a simple taylor expansion , or call it time - dependent perturbation theory , as for example in @xcite , also for nonequilibria .",
    "below we sketch the immediate problem of explicitness , but true enough , the problem is not so much finding a linear response formula but rather to get a useful form that also yields interesting relations with physical concepts within fluctuation theory .",
    "we prepare the system at time @xmath59 according to its stationary distribution @xmath19 ; the perturbation @xmath96 is added for positive times  we think of the set - up in .",
    "therefore , for times @xmath67 the dynamics has ( backward ) generator ( working on observables ) @xmath97 with @xmath15 written as diagonal matrix . for the change in expectations at times @xmath35 with respect to what we had at time zero @xmath98 we get the linear order @xmath99 or , always to leading order in @xmath100 , @xmath101 = \\int_0^t{\\textrm{d}}s\\,r_{qv}(t , s)\\ ] ] with response function @xmath102 ( the dependence on time @xmath1 and on time @xmath35 is made for greater generality in case the perturbation is time - dependent through @xmath8 . )",
    "equation is directly useful when @xmath19 is given , as in equilibrium , but not otherwise . with partial integration",
    "we obtain @xmath103 where in the second line we have introduced the equilibrium form ( first term ) at inverse temperature @xmath16 as a reference .",
    "the term @xmath104 is unknown in general which brings the lack of explicitness .",
    "we can still make the connection with @xcite .",
    "we define a new current @xmath105 ( with respect to @xmath106 of ) that remains divergenceless : @xmath107 so that it still satisfies the same fokker - planck equation ( stationary for @xmath108 ) . in terms of this new current",
    "we get @xmath109 which is exactly the formula for the response relation in @xcite .",
    "indeed , as also pointed out in @xcite , the nonequilibrium fluctuation - response relation reduces to the equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation when viewed from a `` lagrangian frame , '' moving with the local velocity of the system .",
    "let us now see how the above expressions are mathematically related to our formula . as above and as in @xcite",
    "we restrict ourselves to having one environment temperature @xmath110 .",
    "the crucial term to rewrite in ( [ genfor ] ) and ( [ ttt ] ) is the one with the derivative with respect to time . by definition of the backward generator @xmath87",
    ", such terms can be rewritten using @xmath111 where @xmath19 is again the stationary measure .",
    "again , this can be rewritten using the definition of the adjoint generator @xmath112 : for smooth functions @xmath113 , @xmath114 or , @xmath115 clearly @xmath112 directly depends on the stationary measure .",
    "its definition also implies that @xmath116 if we now use the explicit form of @xmath112 in this , and plug the result back in ( [ genfor ] ) , then we indeed get ( [ dys1 ] ) .",
    "the derivation above is generalizable to the transient case , in which the response function gets written as @xmath117",
    "in order to illustrate the algorithm in concrete terms , we collect here a number of physically interesting examples of nonequilibrium systems following the langevin equations : we remind that a potential @xmath18 determines conservative forces @xmath118 , but the degrees of freedom @xmath119 can be at different temperatures @xmath78 , generating a regime out of equilibrium . for simplicity we have fixed a diffusion constant @xmath73 .",
    "the respective reservoirs are at equilibrium and they impose the einstein relation with the friction coefficients @xmath120 . another way of going out of equilibrium is to introduce nonconservative forces @xmath121 , such as external fields that are rotational .",
    "a final possibility is to start from an initial condition that is not stationary , and thus to observe the response in a transient regime .",
    "numerical results are better presented with integrated responses , for example by considering the generalized susceptibility @xmath122 for small constant @xmath123 for all times @xmath124 .",
    "recently there have been experiments testing the response of an overdamped particle ( high viscosity limit ) in a periodic potential  @xcite . in the previous paper",
    "@xcite we have discussed simulations of that system . here",
    "we look for the changes in an underdamped set - up , allowing e.g. for the particle to have a considerable inertia and to obey a noisy hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "we denote the position by @xmath125 ( on the circle ) and the momentum by @xmath126 and we choose for simplicity a particle with mass equal to one .",
    "then , the equations simplify to @xmath127 where we abbreviate @xmath128 the nonconservative force @xmath129 is the driving and is taken constant over the circle , thus effectively tilting the conservative potential . at time @xmath34 the unperturbed system is in the stationary nonequilibrium @xmath19 corresponding to . hence , the integrated correlations are @xmath130 contrary to part  i , here we embed @xmath16 s in the definitions of correlation functions : the integrated response relation is thus @xmath131 .",
    "we take @xmath132 like in previous works  @xcite , and again also @xmath133 .",
    "since the perturbation @xmath134 is the gradient of a potential @xmath9 , @xmath135\\ ] ] is an alternative to @xmath136 for expressing the entropic term ( from time - integrating the excess in entropy flux ) .",

    "panels are for simulations with various friction coefficients : @xmath141 ( left ) , @xmath142 ( center ) , and @xmath143 ( right ) . other parameters : @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "the inertial regime is less sensitive to the perturbation , as @xmath139 displays only a small wiggling : a high entropy production is almost compensated by a high activity . for larger friction",
    "we recover previously studied overdamped scenarios ; with this setting ( @xmath146 ) the frenesy is close to zero compared with the excess entropy , and their combination yields @xmath147 .",
    "[ fig : lang ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lang ] we visualize the various terms ( see caption of the figure for more details ) , for three scenarios with different viscosity , increasing from left to right .",
    "the response is well reproduced by @xmath138 of , even if we perform a numerical integration with @xmath148 .",
    "oscillations in the response are visible for small viscosity ; at higher friction there is a monotonous drift toward a new stationary state ( right panel in fig .",

    "all the terms coincide , as expected .",
    "[ fig : lang2 ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lang2 ] we can follow the response as a function of the driving @xmath129 , with @xmath149 for equilibrium . for @xmath152 the entropic term @xmath136 can be quite different from @xmath138 .",
    "we try to imagine here a collection of independent particles with no external potential ( @xmath153 ) except for keeping the particles in a large cylinder filled with some fluid .",
    "the motion is inertial and driven , e.g. with a driving ( @xmath154 ) resulting from steady differential rotation of the fluid .",
    "we consider therefore the general markov dynamics ( [ ud ] ) , but the equation now refers to a single particle with @xmath155 being possibly different space directions .",
    "we are interested in the ( long ) transient regime in which the position diffuses .",
