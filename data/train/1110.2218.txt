    "a set of monitors in the beam line measures the characteristics of the beam such as intensity and position which are also used to extrapolate the beam properties at the target .",
    "a position monitor located at a point where the beam is dispersed in momentum serves to analyze the energy .",
    "+ the beam hits a 35 cm long aluminum cell filled with liquid hydrogen ( lh@xmath7 ) .",
    "the lh@xmath7 is maintained at 20k by a cryogenic system of 2500w cooling power .",
    "the target cell has been designed such that inhomogeneities in pressure and temperature are minimized .",
    "the variations in the density of the target induced by the beam are slower than the helicity reversal , making the target stable during an asymmetry measurement ( performed over four helicity windows ) . in order to keep hydrogen from freezing",

    "the elastically scattered electrons are selected by a series of collimators which define the @xmath8 acceptance . an 8 segment toroidal magnet focuses the elastic electrons through another set of collimators onto the 8 main erenkov detectors .",

    "a 5inch photo - multiplier tube collects the photo - electrons .",
    "these bars work in an integrating mode , i.e.  individual events are not counted but , rather , the integrated response over the beam burst is recorded . in order to increase the electron signal and",

    ". +    .,width=510 ]    in an ideal experiment , the above mentioned components would be enough , but backgrounds and variation of many parameters such as beam polarization and helicity correlated beam properties impose further considerations .",
    "three important features of the experiment must be known at a precision level that is coherent with the expected error of the asymmetry shown in table [ t_error_budget ] .",
    "the measured asymmetry , @xmath11 , is related to the pves asymmetry as follow : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the beam polarization and @xmath14 is the dilution factor ( i.e.  the fraction of background over signal+background ) . clearly , it is also essential to have an accurate knowledge of the polarization of the beam .",
    "qweak aims for a 1% determination of the ( often exceeded ) 85% polarization .",
    "the first method of polarization measurement is through the mller polarimeter , a well established method already used during previous experiments in hall c. the method consists of inserting a polarized iron foil along the beam trajectory and use the polarization dependent feature of the mller cross section to deduce the beam polarization .",
    "this method is invasive and must be performed at lower current ( few @xmath6a ) for about four hours . with this technique , beam polarization is measured about three times a week during normal conditions and after any intervention in the beam line that could have affected the beam properties . in order to determine the polarization while taking data , the hall c beam line was equipped with a compton polarimeter .",
    "a circularly polarized laser beam hits the electron beam and the polarization dependent feature of the cross section is used to determine the beam polarization .",
    "there are two detectors , one for the scattered electrons and one for the backscattered photons .",
    "both provide measurements of the polarization .",
    "since this can be done in nominal conditions , the compton polarimeter can fill the gap between the precise mller measurements .",
    "the aluminum windows of the target cell are a major source of background because they contain neutrons which have a much stronger weak charge as can be seen in table [ charge_table ] .",
    "the effect of aluminum , leading to a correction of about 20% , must be known at a precision of a few percent and is investigated through simulation and by measurement of an empty target cell .",
    "another element of interest in equation ( [ eq_ameas ] ) is the @xmath8 which has to be known at 1% accuracy .",
    "the @xmath8 determination is achieved with two sets of drift chambers , upstream and downstream of the toroidal magnet .",
    "due to the high rate of nominal beam current ( @xmath15@xmath6a ) , the measurement is performed at reduced current of about 50 pa .",
    "there is also a quartz scanner of @xmath16@xmath10 fused silica located behind the main detectors which can either run with the reduced current and the full 180@xmath6a .",
    "hence , the scanner asserts that the scattered electrons measured by the drift chambers have the same kinematic profile as in nominal data taking .",
    "the last term of equation ( [ eq_ameas ] ) refers to correlations with helicity of various parameters such as beam energy , position and intensity .",
    "it should contribute no more than 0.5% of the final asymmetry measurement uncertainty .",
    "these errors are controlled by , first , monitoring and minimizing them during data taking and by correcting the remaining asymmetries at the analysis stage . in the analysis ,",
    "the raw asymmetries are corrected using the equation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the uncorrected asymmetry , @xmath19 are the differences in beam monitors correlated with helicity , and @xmath20 are the correction coefficients which are a measure of the sensitivity of the asymmetry to fluctuations in the beam parameters . since the @xmath20 are measured concomitantly with data taking , they are valid for exact running conditions .",
    "a further protection against helicity correlated properties relies on the reversal of the helicity of the beam by independent methods .",
    "using a half - wave plate at the source , the direction of the linear polarization of the laser light incident to the pockels cell is inverted every eight hours .",
    "furthermore , an even slower reversal through wien rotation along the beam line is applied every week .",
    "the first phase of the experiment has finished in may 2011 and qweak has accumulated about 25% of the total statistical sample needed to achieve the 4ppb error on the asymmetry .",
    "a selected sample of the measured asymmetries is shown in figure [ mdallbars_perslugs ] , where the effect of the slow reversal of the beam helicity by the insertable half - wave plate can be seen . at the current of 165@xmath6a ,",
    "the width of the measured asymmetry distribution is about 236ppm . combining the width of pure counting statistics , 215ppm , to our determination of detector resolution , target fluctuations and current normalization",
    ", the width is expected to be 235ppm .",
    "one therefore concludes that the resolution of the measurement is well understood .    ) ) on all of the radiator bars as function of slug numbers which represents about 8 hours of data taking .",
    "the position of the insertable half - wave plate ( hwp ) , inverting the polarization state at the source , is indicated by the blue disk , hwp _ in _ , and red square , hwp _ out_. one can clearly observe the sign flip of the asymmetries when the hwp is inserted .",
    "the dashed blue line shows the average of hwp _ in _ asymmetries and the dashed - dotted red line the average of the hwp _ out _ asymmetries .",
