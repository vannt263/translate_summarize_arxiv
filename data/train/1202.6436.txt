    "in this paper , a robust tracking control scheme is designed for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems .",
    "the design is composed of two steps . in the first step a linearized uncertainty model for the uncertain nonlinear system",
    "is developed using a robust feedback linearization approach .",
    "the feedback linearization approach has many applications in the process control and aerospace industries . using this method",
    ", a large class of nonlinear systems can be made to exhibit linear input - output behavior using a nonlinear state feedback control law .",
    "once the input - output map is linearized , any linear controller design method can be used to design a desired controller .",
    "one of the limitations of the standard feedback linearization method is that the model of the system must be exactly known . in the presence of uncertainty in the system ,",
    "exact feedback linearization is not possible and uncertain nonlinear terms remain in the system .    in order to resolve the issue of uncertainty after canceling the nominal nonlinear terms using the feedback linearization method ,",
    "several approaches have been considered in the literature @xcite .",
    "most of these approaches use adaptive or related design procedures to estimate the uncertainty in the system . in these methods",
    ", mismatched uncertainties are decomposed into matched and mismatched parts .",
    "these methods typically require the mismatched parts not to exceed some maximum allowable bound @xcite .",
    "the existing results that are based on mismatched uncertainties either do not guarantee stability or require some stringent conditions on the nonlinearities and uncertainties to guarantee the stability of the system @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we approach the uncertainty issue in a different way and represent the uncertain nonlinear system in an uncertain linearized form .",
    "we use a nominal feedback linearization method to cancel the nominal nonlinear terms , and use a generalized mean value theorem to linearize the nonlinear uncertain terms . in our previous work @xcite , the uncertain nonlinear terms are linearized using a taylor expansion at a steady state operating point by considering a structured representation of the uncertainties .",
    "this linearization approach approximates the actual nonlinear uncertainty by considering only the first order terms and neglecting all of the higher order terms . in @xcite ,",
    "the uncertain nonlinear terms are linearized using a taylor expansion but an unstructured representation of uncertainty is considered . in both of these methods ,",
    "the linearized uncertainty model was obtained by ignoring higher order terms . in @xcite , we introduced the linearization of nonlinear terms using using a generalized mean value theorem @xcite approach .",
    "this method exactly linearizes the uncertain nonlinear terms at an arbitrary point and therefore , no higher order terms exist . in @xcite , the upper bound on the uncertainties is obtained by using unstructured uncertainty representations .",
    "the bound obtained using an unstructured uncertainty representation may be conservative which may degrade the performance of the closed loop system . in order to reduce conservatism and to obtain an uncertain linearized model with a structured uncertainty representation , a different approach for obtaining an upper bound is presented here .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , here we propose a minimax linear quadratic regulation ( lqr ) @xcite controller which combines with a standard feedback linearization law and gives a stable closed loop system in the presence of uncertainty . here",
