    "in the ten years since the discovery of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a main - sequence star @xcite , more than 170 planets have been discovered .",
    "the vast majority of these have been detected via high - precision radial - velocity measurements of the planet s gravitational influence on its host star .",
    "current doppler surveys now routinely achieve precisions of 2 - 3 m s@xmath5 ( e.g.  cochran et al .",
    "2004 ) , facilitating the detection of ever - lower - mass companions , such as the `` hot neptunes '' @xcite and even `` super - earths '' @xcite .",
    "however , there exists a relatively long record of radial velocity data at somewhat lower precision ( @xmath6 15 - 20 m s@xmath5 ) which ought not to be ignored .",
    "such data now cover nearly a quarter - century @xcite , and as such are extremely useful in probing nearby stars for long - period giant planets akin to our own jupiter ( orbital period 11.9 years ) .",
    "these data sets are valuable tools in the search for extrasolar analogs to our solar system .",
    "we are now beginning to obtain meaningful answers to some of the following questions : what is the frequency of long - period giant planets in the solar neighborhood ?",
    "what implications would the lack of such planets have on theories of planet formation ?",
    "how many planetary systems resemble our own solar system ?    in this work , we merge radial - velocity data from three phases of observations at mcdonald observatory , and we also include data from the cfht study of @xcite . in  2 , we describe the data sets ,  3 describes the merging procedure and outlines the algorithm used to derive companion limits , and in  4 we present and discuss the constraints these data place on the presence of planets orbiting these stars .",
    "radial - velocity searches for planets around other stars began well before the 1995 discovery of 51  pegb .",
    "@xcite showed that the fundamental limit to the precision of classical radial velocity techniques was not instruments used , but rather was a result of the calibration processes .",
    "they pointed out that the optical paths followed by the stellar beam and the separate comparison source illuminated the spectrograph optics differently .",
    "@xcite demonstrated how zonal errors in spectrograph optics contribute directly to wavelength ( and thus velocity ) errors .",
    "in addition , thermal and mechanical motion of the spectrograph in the time interval between obtaining the stellar and calibration observations also contributed to the measured velocity errors .",
    "@xcite proposed that these sources of errors could be defeated through the calibration of the spectrograph by an absorption line spectrum imposed on the stellar light _ before _",
    "it entered the spectrograph .",
    "they suggested that the use of the very convenient absorptions by the earth s atmospheric o@xmath7 band at 6300 would permit stellar radial velocities to be measured to a precision perhaps as good as 0.01kms@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite first used an externally applied absorption spectrum to provide a stable velocity metric for precise radial velocity measurement as applied to planet detection . instead of the telluric absorption spectrum , they chose to use a stabilized hf gas absorption cell in front of the coud spectrograph of the canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the hf 3 - 0 r branch lines near 8700 gave radial velocity precision of 15ms@xmath5 in their twelve - year survey of 21 bright solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "although @xcite did not claim any planet detections based on the cfht data alone , two of their target objects ( @xmath8  eridani and @xmath9  cephei ) were subsequently found to have planetary companions when the cfht data were combined with mcdonald observatory data @xcite .",
    "the cfht survey marked the start of a large number of diverse efforts to conduct high - precision radial velocity surveys .",
    "at the university of arizona , @xcite developed a precise radial velocity spectrometer based on the use of a fabry - perot etalon in transmission in front of a cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph .",
    "this instrument was able to achieve velocity precision of 8ms@xmath5 for bright sources @xcite , and led to the discovery of the radial velocity variability of k - giants @xcite .",
    "the idea of using various types of interferometers to obtain precise stellar velocity measurements has been quite popular , with designs proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . of these designs , only @xcite were successful in developing the design into an instrument that actually discovered an extrasolar planet @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , @xcite first used the molecular iodine b@xmath10x@xmath11 band as a velocity reference system , in application to his measurements of the solar rotation .",
    "@xcite then extended this use of the b - x i@xmath7 band to the measurement of the doppler shifts of several solar photospheric absorption lines .",
    "@xcite then extended the use of i@xmath7 as a velocity metric in searching for p - mode oscillations of @xmath12  cmi .",
    "@xcite then implemented the use of the i@xmath7 velocity metric for large - scale precise radial velocity surveys for extrasolar planets .",
    "the use of an i@xmath7 cell offers the major advantage that the i@xmath7 lines can be used to measure the spectrometer instrumental profile @xcite and thus measure very precise radial velocity variations @xcite .",
    "an alternative is to use an optical - fiber fed cross dispersed echelle spectrograph with simultaneous wavelength calibration .",
    "this was first done with elodie @xcite and later with elodie @xcite . to further improve precision with this technique",
    ", the harps instrument @xcite is placed in a temperature - stabilized vacuum chamber .",
    "the mcdonald observatory planetary search program comprises a large , multifaceted investigation to detect and characterize planetary companions to other stars in our galaxy .",
    "it began in 1988 as a high - precision radial velocity survey of bright nearby stars using the mcdonald observatory 2.7 m harlan j.  smith telescope and coud spectrograph , but has expanded substantially in size and scope since then .",
    "phase i of the radial velocity planet search program used the telluric o@xmath7 lines near 6300 as the velocity metric , a technique suggested by @xcite .",
    "a single order of the mcdonald 2.7 m telescope coud echelle spectrograph ( cs12 ) was isolated onto a texas instruments @xmath13 ccd at @xmath14 .",
    "this system gave about 20ms@xmath5 precision on stars down to @xmath15 , but suffered from systematic velocity errors , possibly due to prevailing atmospheric winds .",
    "diurnal and seasonal variability in the winds introduced spurious periodic signals in the data .",
    "we therefore switched to a temperature stabilized i@xmath7 cell as the velocity metric in 1992 .",
    "this eliminated the systematic errors , and gave a routine radial velocity precision of @xmath615ms@xmath5 .",
    "this precision was limited by the 9.6 bandpass of the single order of the echelle grating , and by the poor charge - transfer and readout properties of the ti 800x800 ccd . to solve these problems , and to achieve substantially improved precision , we began phase iii of the radial velocity program in july 1998 , using the same i@xmath7 cell with the newly installed 2dcoud cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph @xcite with its 2048x2048 tektronix ccd .",
    "we set up the spectrograph to include echelle orders from 3594 to 10762 , which covers the ca  ii h and k lines used to measure stellar activity .",
    "wavelength coverage is complete from the blue end to 5691 , and there are increasingly large inter - order gaps from there to the red end @xcite .",
    "using the full 1200 bandpass of the i@xmath7 absorption band at the @xmath16 focus of the 2dcoud allows routine internal precision of 69ms@xmath5 to be achieved . the mcdonald program has subsequently been expanded significantly to include a collaboration with martin krster and colleagues on southern hemisphere radial velocity surveys using the facilities of eso at la silla and the vlt @xcite , and a program to use the keck  1 hires spectrograph to search for planetary companions to stars in the hyades @xcite and in the use of the high resolution spectrograph on the hobby - eberly telescope @xcite .",
    "observations from the mcdonald planet search program have been used in the discovery of four planets : 16 cyg bb @xcite , @xmath9 cep ab @xcite , @xmath8 eridani b @xcite , and hd  13189b @xcite .",
    "mcdonald data were also instrumental in the detection of the brown dwarf hd  137510b @xcite .",
    "the majority of the data used in this study were obtained by the mcdonald observatory program phases i - iii using the 2.7 m harlan j.  smith telescope .",
    "a list of the target stars is given in table 1 .",
    "for 17 of the 31 stars in this study , additional data were available from the cfht precision radial - velocity work of @xcite .",
    "table 2 gives a summary of all four data sets , including the total time span , rms of each data set , and the chromospheric emission ratio log @xmath17 @xcite computed from the mcdonald phase iii measurements of the ca  ii s - index .",
    "the rms values listed in table 2 include the internal uncertainties of 69ms@xmath5 and the velocity jitter inherent to each star .",
    "since each of the four data sets consists of velocities measured relative to an independent and arbitrary zero - point , it was necessary to implement a consistent and robust method of combining them . before merging , an iterative outlier - rejection routine was applied to each data set separately .",
    "data points which were more than @xmath18rms from the mean were rejected .",
    "this criterion corresponds to a 99.9% confidence level for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the mean and rms were then re - computed and the outlier rejection was repeated until no more points were rejected .",
    "as the targets are well - studied constant - velocity stars , we are confident that we have a well - defined distribution about the mean . for the visual binary 70  oph  a",
    ", several velocities were systematically too low due to spectral contamination caused by the chance alignment of both components on the slit , and these points were also removed . the fainter component ( @xmath19 mag )",
    "adds a doppler - shifted second spectrum , which distorts the line shapes . since our velocity computation method assumes a single set of lines , the resultant velocity is skewed by this contamination .",
    "the merging of these data sets was accomplished in the following manner : mcdonald phases ii and iii are joined with a trial offset , and a least - squares linear fit of a trend of velocity with time is performed on the combination .",
    "the offset between the phase ii and iii data sets which minimizes the rms about that linear fit is the one which is applied in order to merge two phases together .",
    "this process was then repeated sequentially to join the phase i and then the cfht data to the growing data string .",
    "the least - squares fitting allows for a linear trend to be present ; the merging process was re - done for all non - binaries , this time forcing the slope to be zero ( i.e. minimizing the rms about the mean of the combined data for a grid of trial offsets ) .",
    "the rms about the mean of data merged in this manner was compared to the rms about a linear fit to data merged allowing a trend . since our null hypothesis is that the stars are radial - velocity constants , the method which allowed a slope was only chosen for the 9 stars which showed an improvement in the rms of the merged data set when a slope was allowed .",
    "those stars were : @xmath20 cep , @xmath20 cas , @xmath12 for , @xmath21 uma , @xmath22 boo  a , @xmath23 her , 70 oph a , and 61  cyg  a & b. all of these stars are well - known long - period binaries , so the use of a slope was justified .",
    "the orbital periods of these 9 known binaries were sufficiently long that a simple linear approximation was sufficient , except for @xmath23 her , @xmath22 boo a ( quadratic trend ) and 70  oph  a ( keplerian solution )",
    ". fits to these trends were subtracted from the data sets and the residuals were used as input for the detection - limit algorithm .",
    "the three data sets on the visual binary @xmath23 her were merged in a similar manner .",
    "the binary period ( 43.2 years ; worley & heintz 1995 ) is such that a linear trend is a suboptimal approximation for the purposes of merging the 16.9 years of data , and a quadratic fit was used to approximate the shape of the orbit .",
    "this procedure was also used for @xmath22 boo  a ; the data and fits are shown in figure 1 . for 70  oph  a , the quadratic approximation was still insufficient , as the 16.1 years of available data represents a significant portion of the 91.44 year published orbital period @xcite , and an orbital solution for the binary system had to be obtained using gaussfit @xcite .",
    "the solution to the combined data set ( mcdonald phases i - iii plus much lower - precision data from batten et al .  1984 ) is given in table 3 , and plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the large uncertainties in the fitted parameters are due to the fact that the available data do not encompass a complete orbit , and hence the model is poorly constrained .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath24 was derived by a rudimentary grid search around the published value , as gaussfit would not converge with @xmath24 as a free parameter .",
    "the orbital parameters of the binary system are substantially different than those reported in @xcite , likely owing to the fact that the mcdonald velocities , which are an order of magnitude more precise , drive the fit .",
    "only the mcdonald data were used in the computation of companion limits for 70 oph  a.      after the data sets were merged together , and trends due to binary orbits were subtracted , we searched for periodicities using a lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite .",
    "false alarm probabilities ( fap ) were established using a bootstrap randomization method as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this bootstrap method , unlike the nominal analytic fap formula of @xcite , makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data ; rather , the error distribution of the actual data themselves is used .",
    "the periodogram search interval was from 2 days up to the full extent of observations for each object .",
    "we used 10,000 bootstrap randomizations to determine the fap of the highest peak in the periodogram for each star ; the results are given in table 4 .",
    "only one star had a periodicity with a significance greater than 99% : @xmath25 ori , with a peak at 73.26 days and a bootstrap fap of 0.8% .",
    "as this is an active early - type ( f6v ) star , we are confident that this is due to a combination of stellar activity and reduced velocity precision ( from the paucity of lines ) rather than the presence of a companion . additionally , no peak was evident in a periodogram on the more precise mcdonald phase iii data alone , supporting our conclusion that it is a spurious noise spike .",
    "companion limits were determined via an algorithm which injected test signals into the data , and then attempted to recover that signal using a periodogram search .",
    "test signals were generated using the method of lehmann - filhs @xcite as described in @xcite :    @xmath26,\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the radial velocity , @xmath9 is the systemic velocity , @xmath28 is the velocity semiamplitude , @xmath29 the orbital eccentricity , @xmath24 the argument of periastron , and @xmath30 the true anomaly . in the above equation , @xmath30 can be expressed in terms of observables via the following relations :    @xmath31^{1/2}~tan~\\frac{e}{2}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath32    for a signal with period @xmath33 , periastron passage time @xmath34 , observation time @xmath35 , mean anomaly @xmath36 , and eccentric anomaly @xmath37 . for each data",
    "set , the algorithm stepped through 300 trial periods at even steps in the logarithm between 2 days and the total duration of observations . at each trial period , the program sampled 30 phase steps of the periastron time @xmath34 , and for nonzero eccentricities , sampled 36 values of the argument of periastron @xmath24 at intervals of 10 degrees .",
    "the velocity semi - amplitude @xmath28 of the test signal was allowed to vary from 10 to 1000 m s@xmath5 .",
    "the systemic velocity @xmath9 of each combined data set was forced to be equal to zero .",
    "for each set of keplerian orbital parameters , synthetic radial velocities were generated using the observation times from the input data .",
    "this simulated signal was then added to the data , and a lomb - scargle periodogram was used to attempt to recover that signal . for a signal to count as having been recovered , the periodogram s highest peak had to occur at the correct period with a fap of less than 0.1% .",
    "the fap was estimated using the formula from @xcite . for each @xmath28 velocity , 99% of the 1080 test signals , _ all _",
    "30 variations in @xmath34 had to be recovered , as @xmath24 had no meaning .",
    "] had to be recovered in this manner in order for that velocity semiamplitude ( corresponding to a planet of a given mass at a given semimajor axis ) to be considered `` ruled out '' by the data .",
    "if more than 1% of the orbital configurations tested at a given @xmath28 value were _ not _ ruled out in this manner , the algorithm increased @xmath28 by 1 m s@xmath5 and repeated the process until it was able to recover 99% of the parameter configurations ( @xmath38 ) that were tested .",
    "once this occurred , the planetary mass ruled out was computed by the following :    @xmath39^{1/3},\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the stellar mass in solar masses , @xmath33 is the orbital period in days , @xmath28 is the radial - velocity semiamplitude in km s@xmath5 , and @xmath41 sin @xmath0 is the projected planetary mass in solar masses .",
    "the algorithm then moved to the next trial period and repeated the entire process .",
    "unlike most previous companion limit determinations @xcite , this procedure allows for nonzero eccentricities in the trial orbits ( but see desidera et al .",
    "for the eccentric case , a value of @xmath3 was chosen ; of the known extrasolar planets , 90% have @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "allowing higher eccentricities substantially reduced the ability to rule out the test signals , as the sporadic sampling of the data would likely miss the relatively high - velocity points near periastron .",
    "figure 3 shows the effect of allowing various ranges of eccentricity .",
    "note that although the limits derived by this study are rendered somewhat less stringent by the inclusion of nonzero eccentricities , the effect is relatively minor for our adopted value of @xmath3 . allowing a larger range of eccentricities ( up to @xmath43 ) , however , substantially reduces the sensitivity of the companion - limit determination , as demonstrated in figure 3 .",
    "we emphasize that the upper limits derived by the method described above are much more stringent , and hence will result in higher companion - mass limits than those reported by previous studies .",
    "limits to planetary companions derived using these data are shown in figures 4 - 11 . in each panel ,",
    "the lower set of points ( solid line ) represents the companion limits for the zero - eccentricity case , and the dotted line is for the case of @xmath3 .",
    "notably , despite the abundance and quality of data available in this study , we are as yet unable to rule out _ any _ planets with m sin @xmath44 1  in 5.2 au orbits with eccentricities as large as @xmath3 .",
    "when only circular orbits are considered , such objects can be ruled out for @xmath45 ceti , @xmath46 dra , 61 cyg a , and 61 cyg b. table 5 lists the minimum planet masses that can be excluded by these data at selected semimajor axes , for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 cases .",
    "the results given in table 5 are shown in histogram format in figure 12 , which indicates that for most stars in this survey , saturn - mass planets in close orbits ( @xmath47 au ) can be ruled out .",
    "it is also useful to consider the effect of giant planets in intermediate orbits ( @xmath48 au ) which may perturb lower - mass planets within the habitable zone of the star .",
    "if such objects can be excluded with confidence , their host stars become attractive candidates for the _ terrestrial planet finder _",
    "( tpf ) and darwin missions , which aim to detect earth - like planets in the habitable zone .",
    "@xcite defined a planet s zone of influence to extend from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , where the hill radius is    @xmath51    and @xmath29 is the planet s eccentricity , @xmath52 is its semimajor axis , @xmath53 is its mass , and @xmath54 is the mass of the star .",
    "simulations by @xcite demonstrated that terrestrial planets were nearly always ejected or consumed in systems where an eccentric giant planet s zone of influence overlapped the habitable zone .",
    "we can then ask whether the companion limits derived in this work can be used to exclude such perturbing bodies .",
    "such a pursuit is limited by the fact that even distant giant planets can disrupt the habitable zone if their orbits are sufficiently eccentric , and as shown in figure 1 , the nature of the radial - velocity data is such that we are least sensitive to the most eccentric planets . nevertheless , for small eccentricities ( @xmath55 ) , it is possible to combine these dynamical calculations with our companion - limit determinations to define a `` safe zone '' : a region of parameter space in which we can exclude perturbing giant planets exterior to the habitable zone . for such regions ,",
    "the possibility of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone remains open for programs such as tpf and darwin . in figures 4 - 11",
    ", the region to the left of the dot - dashed line and above the dotted line defines the `` safe zone '' for perturbing outer giant planets with @xmath56 .",
    "these were only plotted for main - sequence stars , using the definition of the `` continuously habitable zone '' given in @xcite .",
    "the region left of the dot - dashed line and _ below _ our limits represents a set of potentially dangerous objects which would disrupt the habitable zone , yet be undetectable with the current data .",
    "higher eccentricities would push the dot - dashed line to the right and reduce its slope , such that for perturbers with @xmath57 , our limits computations can say nothing about such objects ( i.e.  the curves would not intersect ) .",
    "the companion limits we have derived thus place some constraints on potentially disruptive objects in these systems , which will assist in target selection for the tpf and darwin missions .    noting that the phase iii data are of substantially higher quality than the previous data sets",
    ", we asked what velocity rms would be required to rule out a jupiter analog orbiting a solar - type star .",
    "we generated simulated observations consisting of gaussian noise at the actual observation times ( spanning 16 years ) for 16  cyg  a , the star in this study which is closest in spectral type ( g1.5 v ) to our sun .",
    "figure 13 shows the results of the companion - limit algorithm on four of these simulated data sets with four levels of rms scatter . in order to rule out a planet with m sin @xmath0 of 1  in a 5.2 au orbit ( @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the data need to have an rms less than about 10 m s@xmath5 .",
    "the rms of phase iii observations of 16  cyg  a is 6.9 m s@xmath5 over a period of 6.3 years , whereas the complete 16 years has an overall rms of 26.8 m s@xmath5 .",
    "hence , a jupiter analog could be ruled out for 16  cyg  a with about 10 more years of data of the same quality as mcdonald phase iii .",
    "the weighted mean rms of all mcdonald phase iii observations in this survey is 12.6 m s@xmath5 .",
    "eleven stars ( see table 2 ) currently achieve a phase iii rms better than 8 m s@xmath5 ; this represents one - third of the stars discussed in this work .",
    "these simulations show that the average precision of phase iii needs to be improved by about 2 - 3 m s@xmath5 in order to achieve the sensitivity required to detect or exclude jupiter analogs for all of these stars .",
    "we have amassed a substantial quantity of radial - velocity data on 31 nearby stars , spanning up to 23 years of observations . we have applied a robust method to place conservative limits on planetary companions orbiting these stars .",
    "we have considered the effect of eccentric orbits in our computations , which better reflects the diversity of known extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "saturn - mass planets within 0.1  au can be ruled out for nearly all of these stars . at 5.2 au",
    ", we can exclude on average planets with m sin @xmath0 2.0@xmath11.1  ( @xmath2)and m sin @xmath0 4.0@xmath12.8  ( @xmath3 ) for 25 of the 31 stars .",
    "although we now have a quite sufficient time baseline for the detection of jupiter analogs in @xmath612 year orbits , we find that the overall velocity precision is not yet sufficient to exclude jupiter - mass planets at 5.2  au .",
    "however , improvements in the current mcdonald observatory 2.7 m telescope planet search program put the desired level of precision within reach for inactive stars .",

    "<S> based on the long - term radial - velocity surveys carried out with the mcdonald observatory 2.7 m harlan j.  smith telescope from 1988 to the present , we derive upper limits to long - period giant planet companions for 31 nearby stars . </S>",
    "<S> data from three phases of the mcdonald observatory 2.7 m planet - search program have been merged together and for 17 objects , data from the pioneering canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) radial - velocity program have also been included in the companion - limits determination . </S>",
    "<S> for those 17 objects , the baseline of observations is in excess of 23 years , enabling the detection or exclusion of giant planets in orbits beyond 8 au . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the possibility of eccentric orbits in our computations . at an orbital separation of 5.2 </S>",
    "<S> au , we can exclude on average planets of m sin @xmath0 2.0@xmath11.1  ( @xmath2 ) and m sin @xmath0 4.0@xmath12.8  ( @xmath3 ) for 25 of the 31 stars in this survey . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are not yet able to rule out `` true jupiters , '' i.e.  planets of m sin @xmath4 1  in 5.2 au orbits . </S>",
    "<S> these limits are of interest for the space interferometry mission ( sim ) , terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) , and darwin missions which will search for terrestrial planets orbiting nearby stars , many of which are included in this work . </S>"
