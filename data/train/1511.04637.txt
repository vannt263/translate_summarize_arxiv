    "note that @xmath180 includes the black arcs to the left of @xmath72 but not the grey arcs to the right of @xmath72 .",
    "then @xmath180 is a rational tangle ; and since there are at least two crossings in @xmath182 , the tangle @xmath180 is neither a horizontal tangle nor a trivial vertical tangle .",
    "is a rational tangle which is neither a horizontal tangle nor a trivial vertical tangle.,width=264 ]    now there is a path that goes from the nw and sw points of @xmath180 leftward until its ends meet in @xmath36 , at @xmath30 , or at some other vertex .",
    "also there is a path that goes rightward from the ne and se points of @xmath180 until the ends meet in @xmath36 , at @xmath30 , or at some other vertex .",
    "note that since @xmath36 has @xmath16-parity , at most one of these paths contains @xmath30 .",

    "if @xmath85 has @xmath26-parity , then the strands going into @xmath72 from the right are connected together in @xmath85 .",
    "hence they are part of a loop in @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath85 does not have @xmath26-parity , then there is a path from the ne point of @xmath85 to @xmath72 .",

    "in order to prove the backward direction of theorem  [ monthm ] , we make use of the following definition and theorem due to sawollek @xcite",
    ".    let @xmath4 be a 4-valent graph embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "the set of _ associated links _ @xmath184 consists of all knots and links that can be obtained from @xmath4 by replacing a neighborhood of each vertex of @xmath4 by a rational tangle .",
    "[ backward ] let @xmath97 be a projection of a montesinos tangle in standard form , and suppose that @xmath17 is obtained from @xmath10 by an exceptional vertex insertion .",

    ", there is a single @xmath36 with @xmath16-parity , and @xmath69 has no vertices . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath185 . also , for all @xmath76 , @xmath71 has a single vertex @xmath72 which is either in @xmath73 or possibly in @xmath74 if @xmath75 has only one crossing .",
    "furthermore , @xmath85 ( the subtangle of @xmath78 consisting of the boxes to the right of @xmath72 ) is a rational tangle with at least two crossings and @xmath71 has a loop containing @xmath72 .",
    "now for each @xmath158 such that @xmath72 is in @xmath74 , we move @xmath72 to @xmath73 by flipping @xmath85 as illustrated in figure  [ onecrossingina2 ] .      next , for each sequential @xmath141 such that @xmath76 , we flip the part of the projection of @xmath18 to the left of @xmath187 repeatedly to move the crossings of @xmath187 to @xmath188",
    ". then we remove all of the accumulated crossings from @xmath188 by twisting the strands around @xmath30 .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ flypeai ] , where @xmath188 begins with zero crossings and @xmath189 begins with three crossings . in the second picture we have moved the three crossings of @xmath189 to @xmath188 , and in the third picture we have removed all of the crossings from @xmath188 .",
    "this gives us a projection of @xmath18 such that for each @xmath76 , the vertex @xmath72 is in @xmath73 and all of the crossings of @xmath71 are in @xmath85 .      after doing the moves illustrated in figure  [ onecrossingina2 ] and",
    "figure  [ flypeai ] , there are four different ways that the edges can go in and out of each @xmath85 , which we illustrate in figure  [ possibilities ] .",
    "the leftmost illustration occurs if @xmath72 was originally in the second box so we did not have to flip @xmath85 as in figure  [ onecrossingina2 ] , and in moving the crossings in the first boxes of the @xmath54 to the left as in figure  [ flypeai ] we flipped @xmath174 zero or an even number of times .",
    "the second illustration in figure  [ possibilities ] occurs if @xmath72 was originally in the third box so we flipped @xmath85 as in figure  [ onecrossingina2 ] , and in moving the crossings in the first boxes of the @xmath54 to the left as in figure  [ flypeai ] we flipped @xmath174 zero or an even number of times .",
    "the third illustration occurs if @xmath72 was in the second box so we did not flip @xmath85 as in figure  [ onecrossingina2 ] , but in moving the crossings in the first boxes of the @xmath54 to the left as in figure  [ flypeai ] we flipped @xmath174 an odd number of times .",
    "the rightmost illustration in figure  [ possibilities ] occurs if @xmath72 was in the third box so we flipped @xmath85 as in figure  [ onecrossingina2 ] , and in moving the crossings in the first boxes of the @xmath54 to the left as in figure  [ flypeai ] we flipped @xmath174 an odd number of times .",
    "observe that regardless of which of the four illustrations occur , the only difference between the edges outside of @xmath174 is that the `` dangling edge '' at the left of @xmath174 ( that is the one not going into @xmath72 ) may be above or below the vertex @xmath72 .    in figure  [ exceptionalspecific ]",
    "we define a labeling of the edges of @xmath18 , keeping in mind that @xmath36 has @xmath16-parity and none of the @xmath78 with @xmath190 have @xmath16-parity .",
    "in particular , we label the loop containing @xmath72 by @xmath191 and label the edges which are not loops consecutively as follows .",
    "let @xmath192 be the edge from @xmath30 to @xmath111 , and let @xmath193 be the other edge with one endpoint at @xmath111 .",
    "we label the rest of the edges whose vertices are to the left of @xmath36 consecutively from one vertex to the next as @xmath194 ,  , @xmath195 .",
    "then @xmath195 will have one endpoint at @xmath30 , and hence @xmath196 will be a simple closed curve . similarly , let @xmath197 be the edge of @xmath18 from @xmath30 to the rightmost vertex @xmath198 , and then consecutively label the edges whose endpoints are to the right of @xmath36 as @xmath199 ,  , @xmath200 .",
    "then @xmath200 will also have an endpoint at @xmath30 .",
    "thus @xmath201 will also be a simple closed curve .      in figure  [ exceptionalspecific ] ,",
    "for @xmath202 and @xmath203 we illustrate the dangling edge at the left of @xmath174 above @xmath72 , while for @xmath204 we illustrate the dangling edge at the left of @xmath174 below @xmath205 .",
    "in fact , it makes no difference which of these illustrations occur",
    ".    now observe from figure  [ exceptionalspecific ] that there are no crossings between the projections of any pair of grey loops @xmath191 and @xmath206 with @xmath207 , and hence no such pair can be linked .",
    "also , observe from figure  [ possibilities ] that each individual @xmath191 is the numerator or denominator closure of a single strand of the rational tangle @xmath85 , and so must be unknotted . in addition , the loops @xmath115 and @xmath116 are each connected sums of numerator or denominator closures of single strands of rational tangles .",
    "hence @xmath115 and @xmath116 are also each unknotted .",
    "finally , @xmath115 has no crossings with any @xmath191 with @xmath169 and meets every @xmath191 with @xmath154 at the vertex @xmath72 .",
    "hence @xmath115 can not be linked with any @xmath191 .",
    "similarly , @xmath116 can not be linked with any @xmath191 .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 contains no non - trivial knots or links .    in order to show that @xmath18 is non - planar",
    "we will show that the subgraph @xmath4 obtained by deleting the loops @xmath191 and vertices @xmath72 for all @xmath141 with @xmath76 is non - planar .",
    "the possibilities for @xmath174 with @xmath191 and @xmath72 deleted are illustrated in figure  [ deleted ] .",
    "observe that since @xmath85 is rational , after the deletion of @xmath191 , the tangle @xmath85 is left with a single unknotted strand .",
    "thus in @xmath4 , each @xmath174 with @xmath141 and @xmath76 is a trivial horizontal tangle .",
    "it now follows that the spatial graph @xmath4 has one of the forms illustrated in figure  [ nonplanar ] . since @xmath36 has @xmath16-parity , regardless of which form @xmath4 has , as an abstract graph @xmath4 is isomorphic to the illustration on the left of figure  [ parity ] .",
    "we now let @xmath208 denote the planar embedding of @xmath4 illustrated on the right side of figure  [ parity ] , and obtain the set of associated links @xmath209 by replacing the two vertices of @xmath208 by rational tangles @xmath91 and @xmath210 .",
    "the denominator closure of a rational tangle is a @xmath19-bridge knot or link .",
    "thus all of the non - trivial , non - split links in @xmath209 are either the connected sum of two 2-bridge knots or links or a single @xmath19-bridge knot or link .",
    "hence , by sawollek s theorem , to show that the spatial graph @xmath4 is non - planar , it suffices to show that the set of associated links @xmath184 contains some prime knot or link which is not @xmath19-bridge .    in figure  [ pq ] , we replace the vertices @xmath30 and @xmath111 of @xmath4 by the rational tangles @xmath91 and @xmath210 to get the elements of @xmath184",
    ". then in figure  [ r1q ] , we group the rational tangles @xmath211 and @xmath210 together to create a single tangle @xmath212 .",
    "recall that @xmath211 is an alternating rational tangle with at least two crossings .",
    "thus we can choose a rational tangle @xmath210 so that @xmath212 is a non - trivial rational tangle which is not horizontal .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath210 will depend on @xmath211 as well as on which form @xmath212 has .",
    "now since @xmath36 has @xmath16-parity , it can not be horizontal ; and by hypothesis @xmath36 can not be trivial .",
    "thus for any rational tangle @xmath91 , the knot or link @xmath213 will be the numerator closure of a montesinos tangle , where neither @xmath212 nor @xmath36 is horizontal or trivial .",
    "it follows that the double branched cover @xmath214 is a seifert fibered space over @xmath215 , and as long as @xmath91 is not horizontal or trivial , @xmath214 has three exceptional fibers .",
    "now by the classification of seifert manifolds @xcite , we can choose a rational tangle @xmath91 such that @xmath214 is irreducible , not @xmath216 , and has infinite fundamental group .",
    "for such a @xmath91 , we know that @xmath40 will be a prime link which is not @xmath19-bridge .",
    "thus @xmath184 contains a link which is not in @xmath209 .",
    "it follows that @xmath4 is non - planar , and hence @xmath18 must also be non - planar .",
