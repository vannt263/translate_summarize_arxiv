    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are a kind of the most violent explosions in the universe , which radiate huge energy in gamma - ray in a short time ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are so bright and can be detected at much higher redshifts than supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "hitherto , the farthest grb with spectroscopic redshift is grb 090423 at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "so grbs may be useful tools to probe the early universe @xcite , including dark energy @xcite , star formation rate @xcite , reionization @xcite , and metal enrichment @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the progenitors of long grbs with duration time @xmath11 s are thought to be collapse of massive stars @xcite .",
    "observations also show that some long grbs are associated with the deaths of massive stars which will give core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "so grbs can be used to investigate the star formation rate ( sfr ) at high redshifts @xcite . in order to measure sfr by using grbs ,",
    "the relation between the rate of grbs and sfr should be known .",
    "some studies found that the grb rate is consistent with sfr at about @xmath12 , but has an excess at high redshift comparing with that expected from sfr @xcite .",
    "some models have been proposed to explain the discrepancy between sfr and grb rate , such as the cosmic metallicity evolution @xcite , superconducting cosmic strings @xcite , evolving initial mass function ( imf ) of stars @xcite , evolution of the grb luminosity function break @xcite . from the redshift distribution of grbs and the metallicity of grb host galaxies",
    ", @xcite showed that the discrepancy between the grb rate and sfr can be reconciled by considering that grbs occur in low - metallicity galaxies .    in previous literatures ,",
    "the @xmath13 distribution has been used to study the luminosity function and formation rate of grbs @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath13 distribution is the production of the intrinsic luminosity function convolving with the formation rate of grbs , so the luminosity function and formation rate of grbs are degenerated @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are several selection effects on the observed redshift distribution of grbs @xcite , and so the rate of grbs .",
    "the most important one is the observational limit of satellite .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite has a flux limit , which means that it can not detect grb dimmer than the flux limit .",
    "so the observed data is truncated , it will be difficult to get the intrinsic distribution of grb before the selection effect is corrected .",
    "lynden bell ( 1971 ) applied a novel method to study the luminosity function and density evolution from flux - limit quasar sample , which is called lynden - bell s @xmath14 method @xcite .",
    "after that , this method has been widely used in some other objects , such as galaxies @xcite , long grbs @xcite , and short grbs @xcite .",
    "the basis of lynden - bell s @xmath14 method is that the distributions of luminosity @xmath15 and redshift @xmath16 are independent @xcite .",
    "so before applying this method , we need to test the independence of @xmath15 and @xmath16 with a nonparametric test method provided by @xcite .",
    "lynden - bell s @xmath14 method is a powerful method to estimate the luminosity function and formation rate of objects with truncated sample .",
    "for example , @xcite used this method to derive the luminosity function and the formation rate of grb from 689 _ batse _ grbs with pseudo redshifts .",
    "they found that the grb formation rate increases quickly at @xmath17 , and remains approximately constant up to @xmath18 , which is consistent with observed sfr at @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite found that the grb comoving rate density rises steeply at @xmath7 , followed by flattening and declines at about @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite also studied the formation rate of 95 _ swift _ grbs using lynden - bell s @xmath14 method , and found that the grb formation rate increases quickly at @xmath20 , and remains approximately constant at @xmath21 , but finally decreases at @xmath22 , which is well consistent with the sfr @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study luminosity function and formation rate of latest _ swift _ grbs by using lynden - bell s @xmath14 method . the lynden - bell s @xmath14 method can break the degeneracy between luminosity function and grb formation rate .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the data from _ swift _ satellite , and make the k - correction in the next section .",
    "the introductions to lynden - bell s @xmath14 method and the nonparametric @xmath23 statistical method are given in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we derive the luminosity function and formation rate of grbs .",
    "monte carlo simulation is used to test our results in section 5 .",
    "finally , section 6 presents conclusions and discussions . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a flat @xmath24cdm universe with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "_ swift _ is a multi - wavelength satellite to observe grbs .",
    "it has instruments designed to analyze the bursts , x - ray and uv / optical afterglows , which can locate the positions of grbs .",
    "we collect 127 long grbs with well measured spectral parameters given by _",
    "fermi - gbm _ and _ konus - wind_. these grbs have redshift data observed by _ swift_. in table 1 , we list the grb sample , including name ( column 1 ) , redshift ( column 2 ) , low - energy power - law index @xmath27 ( column 3 ) , high - energy power - law index @xmath28 ( column 4 ) , peak energy of the @xmath29 spectrum in observer s frame ( column 5 ) , peak flux in a certain energy range ( column 6 ) , energy range ( column 7 ) , bolometric luminosity ( column 8) and references ( column 9 ) of grbs .",
    "two spectral models are used to fit the spectra of grbs , including a power law with an exponential cutoff model ( plexp ) and the band model @xcite .",
    "the functional forms are as follows ,    @xmath30    @xmath31    which represent a power law with an exponential cutoff model and the band model respectively .    because the peak fluxes are observed in a lager range of redshifts which correspond to different range of energy bands in the rest frame of grbs .",
    "the k - correction is required to get the bolometric luminosity of grbs @xcite .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of grb is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the luminosity distance at redshift @xmath16 , @xmath34 is the peak flux observed between between a certain energy range @xmath35 , and the @xmath36 is the factor of k - correction . if the flux @xmath34 is in units of @xmath37 , the parameter @xmath36 is defined as @xmath38 if the flux @xmath34 is in units of @xmath39 , the parameter @xmath36 is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is spectral model of grb .",
    "then we can obtain the bolometric luminosity @xmath15 of each grb . in figure [ lyndenbellfig ] ,",
    "the blue dots show the bolometric luminosity of grbs , and the line is the observational limit of _ swift_. the limit is chosen as a minimum flux @xmath42 , which is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "so the limit luminosity at redshift @xmath16 is given as @xmath43 .",
    "lynden - bell s @xmath14 method is an efficient method to determinate the distribution of luminosity and redshift of objects with truncated data sample , including quasars @xcite , galaxies @xcite and grbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this method to derive the luminosity function and density evolution from quasars with observational selection for the first time .",
    "this method can break the degeneracy between luminosity function and formation rate .",
    "it is better to extract the luminosity evolution from the form of the luminosity function .",
    "if the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the distribution of luminosity and redshift @xmath44 are independent , we can rewrite @xmath44 as @xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath46 , the fraction of grb brighter than @xmath15 , is the cumulative luminosity function , and @xmath47 is the redshift cumulative distribution .",
    "unfortunately , the luminosity and the redshift of grbs are not independent @xcite , so we should write the @xmath44 as @xmath48 instead of @xmath45 , where @xmath49 is the luminosity function of grb at redshift @xmath16 .",
    "if we remove the effect of the luminosity evolution @xmath50 , i.e. a transformation @xmath51 , the transformed luminosity @xmath52 are independent of redshift . as a result , we can obtain @xmath53 . using the relation @xmath54 ,",
    "we can write the @xmath44 as @xmath55 . then the luminosity function of grb at redshift @xmath16 is @xmath56 .    to get the form of luminosity evolution @xmath50",
    ", we introduce a nonparametric test method proposed by @xcite , which has been widely used in previous literature @xcite . for the @xmath57th data in the ( @xmath58 ) data set",
    ", we can define @xmath59 as @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath57th gbr luminosity and @xmath62 is the maximum redshift at which a grb with luminosity @xmath61 can be observed .",
    "this region is shown in figure [ lyndenbellfig ] as black line rectangle .",
    "the number of grbs contained in this region is @xmath63 .",
    "the number @xmath64 , which means taking the @xmath57th grb out , is the same as @xmath14 in @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xmath65 is defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the minimum observable luminosity at that redshift @xmath68 .",
    "this region is shown as red rectangle in figure [ lyndenbellfig ] .",
    "the number of events contained within this region is @xmath69 .",
    "we first consider the @xmath63 grbs in black rectangle in figure [ lyndenbellfig ] .",
    "the number of events that have redshift @xmath16 less than or equal to @xmath68 is defined as @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are independent , @xmath70 is uniformly distributed between 1 and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the test statistic @xmath23 is @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 are the expected mean and the variance of @xmath70 respectively .",
    "if the @xmath70 is exactly uniformly distributed between 1 to @xmath63 , the samples of @xmath74 and @xmath75 should be nearly equal , and the test statistic @xmath23 will nearly be 0 .",
    "if we choose a from of @xmath50 that makes test statistic @xmath76 , the effect of the luminosity evolution can be removed by transformation of @xmath51 .",
    "the functional form of @xmath77 has been used in previous papers @xcite .",
    "we also use this form in this paper .",
    "then we test the independence between @xmath51 and @xmath16 by changing the value of @xmath78 until the test statistic @xmath23 is zero .",
    "figure [ kvakuefig ] shows the value of test statistic @xmath23 as a function of @xmath78 . from this figure",
    ", we find the best fit is @xmath2 at @xmath79 confidence level .",
    "so we take the luminosity evolution form @xmath50 as @xmath80 .",
    "a hypothesis of no luminosity evolution @xmath81 , is rejected at about @xmath82 confidence level .",
    "this value is similar with @xcite , whose @xmath78-value is @xmath83 and @xmath81 is rejected with about @xmath84 significance from pseudo - redshift grbs .",
    "@xcite also found that the value of @xmath78 is @xmath85 .    after converting the observed luminosity to non - evolving luminosity @xmath86",
    ", we can derive the local cumulative luminosity function @xmath87 with nonparametric method from the following equation @xcite , @xmath88 where @xmath89 means that grb has luminosity @xmath90 larger than @xmath91 .",
    "the cumulative number distribution @xmath47 can be obtained from @xmath92 where @xmath89 means that grb has redshift @xmath93 less than @xmath68 .",
    "the comoving differential form of @xmath47 , which represents the cosmic formation rate of grbs @xmath94 , is more interesting .",
    "the formation rate of grbs can be written as , @xmath95 where @xmath96 results from the cosmological time dilation and @xmath97 is the differential comoving volume , which can be expressed as @xmath98",
    "in this section , we present results on the luminosity function and cosmic formation rate of grbs .      as discussed above",
    ", we get the form of luminosity evolution as @xmath80 by using the nonparametric @xmath23 test method .",
    "the non - evolving luminosity @xmath52 is defined as @xmath99 , which is shown in figure [ newdatafig ] . using this new data set ,",
    "the luminosity function @xmath100 can be derived by using lynden bell s @xmath14 method , which is shown in figure [ luminosityfunfig ] . as shown in figure [ luminosityfunfig ] , the luminosity function @xmath100 can be fitted with a broken power law after removing the redshift evolution .",
    "the form of luminosity function @xmath100 for dimmer and brighter bursts are fitted by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the break point .",
    "this result is consistent with previous work @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to point out that this luminosity function is only the present distribution at @xmath103 since the luminosity evolution is removed .",
    "the luminosity function @xmath49 at redshift @xmath16 will be @xmath104 .",
    "so the break luminosity at @xmath16 is @xmath105 .",
    "figure 5 presents the cumulative grb formation rate @xmath47 . according to equation ( [ formationrate ] ) , in order to get the cosmic formation rate of grbs , we need the differential form of cumulative number distribution @xmath106 .",
    "figure [ dphidzfig ] shows @xmath107 as function of redshift @xmath16 . from this figure",
    ", we find that @xmath107 increases quickly at @xmath108 , then keeps approximately constant for @xmath109 , and decreases sharply at @xmath110 with a power - law form .",
    "but we are more interested in the comoving density rate . from equation ( [ formationrate ] )",
    ", we can calculate the grbs formation rate @xmath94 , which is shown in figure [ formationratefig ] . in figure [ formationratefig ]",
    ", the blue stepwise line represents the comoving cosmic formation of grbs as a function of redshift , and the error bar gives the @xmath79 confidence level .",
    "the best - fitting power laws for different segments are @xmath111 with @xmath112 confidence level . from this equation",
    ", we can derive the formation rate of grbs at the local universe @xmath113 , which is larger than previous studies , e.g. , @xmath114 @xcite , @xmath115 @xcite , and @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that the grb rate keeps constant at low redshift in this paper , while it increases fast in other studies . but @xcite found that the rate of low - luminosity grbs is @xmath117 .",
    "this local rate is not corrected for the jet beaming effect .    obviously , the formation rate of grbs is in contrast to previous estimates of the comoving rate density by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite with the same method .",
    "our results shows that the formation rate of grbs is almost constant at @xmath7 .",
    "but previous results give that the formation rate increases quickly at @xmath118 @xcite , which is consistent with sfr observation @xcite . but our result is consistent with that of @xcite well .",
    "interestingly , the evolution of @xmath119 shown in figure [ dphidzfig ] , is consistent with the behavior of @xmath94 in @xcite .",
    "we also test our program with the same grb data of @xcite and @xcite , and find that our @xmath119 shows the same behaviors as the @xmath94 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "so they might omit the @xmath97 term in their calculations . besides , @xcite and @xcite showed that the grb rate increases as @xmath120 and @xmath121 at @xmath122 respectively , which are much quickly than @xmath123 of @xcite .",
    "several comprehensive works studying the luminosity function and the rate of long grbs have been recently published using different methods ( such as * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the luminosity function is redshift independent , @xcite found that the power law index of luminosity function is @xmath124 at low luminosity , and @xmath125 at high luminosity with break @xmath126 erg  s@xmath127 using long grbs with redshifts determined from afterglow .",
    "the formation rate increases as @xmath128 up to @xmath129 and it decreases as @xmath130 at @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite derived that the luminosity function is nearly flat @xmath131 below break @xmath132 erg  s@xmath127 , and declines @xmath133 using a large sample of grbs detected by _",
    "the grb rate is similar as that of @xcite .",
    "these results are different from our results .",
    "one reason is the grb sample .",
    "we use the latest grb sample , which have redshift observed by _",
    "swift _ and spectral parameters given by _",
    "fermi - gbm _ and _ konus - wind_. the luminosity function evolution may be the most important reason .",
    "@xcite assumed no redshift evolution of luminosity function . in the fitting of @xcite ,",
    "no luminosity evolution is required to produce the observed number of grbs .",
    "but strong evolution of luminosity function is found in literatures .",
    "the evolution of luminosity can be parameterized as @xmath134 ( lloyd - ronning et al .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the evolution factor is @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively .",
    "@xcite found that the luminosity function of grb evolves with a redshift - dependent break luminosity @xmath137 , which is similar with our result .",
    "@xcite found that a evolution factor @xmath138 of luminosity function can fit the batse and swift data .",
    "these works suggest that take a evolution factor into consideration is necessary . besides , our grb sample including those grbs dimmer than @xmath139 is another important reason .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the density of grb is much higher at @xmath122 if they included grbs dimmer than @xmath139 . in this work ,",
    "we use lynden - bell @xmath0 method to correct the data truncated effect and consider the evolution of grb luminosity function .",
    "so we do nt need to omit these dim grbs .",
    "the relation between sfr and formation rate of grbs is attractive .",
    "we also compare our result with the observed sfr from @xcite in figure [ sfrfig ] .",
    "obviously , it is consistent with the observed sfr at @xmath8 , but remarkably different at @xmath7 .",
    "this trend means that the formation rate of grbs @xmath94 does not trace sfr at low redshift @xmath7 .",
    "but at high redshift @xmath140 , our result is consistent with the sfr derived from grbs @xcite .",
    "this result is different with others in previous literatures @xcite , but it is consistent with that of @xcite .",
    "there are also some previous works shown that the long grbs may not unbiased tracers of sfr at low redshift .",
    "a strong dependence of the grb rate on host - galaxy properties out to @xmath141 is found by @xcite .",
    "so use grbs as direct tracers of the cosmic sfr is cautious at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the mass distribution of long grb host galaxy is different with the expected from star - forming galaxies observed in deep survey , which suggests that long grbs are not unbiased tracers of star formation activity at least at @xmath7 .",
    "they also found that long grb rate can directly trace the sfr starting from @xmath142 and above .",
    "in this section , we use monte carlo simulation to test our results .",
    "firstly , we simulate a set of data @xmath143 which follows the distribution described by equation ( [ lumfunfit ] ) and equation ( [ formationratefit1 ] ) using monte carlo method .",
    "then , we transfer the luminosity @xmath52 to @xmath15 through @xmath144 , where @xmath145 .",
    "so we can get sets of pseudo data of grb luminosity and redshift @xmath146 . in the simulations ,",
    "we create 200 pseudo samples .",
    "each sample contains 130 grbs .",
    "then we use lynden - bell @xmath0 method and nonparametric @xmath23 test method to calculate the distributions of these pseudo samples .",
    "finally , we compare the simulated data with observed data .",
    "figure [ comparedatafig ] shows the comparing results .",
    "the four panels give the luminosity - redshift distribution , luminosity function , cumulative distribution and @xmath9 distribution . in the panel a , we randomly choose one pseudo sample of grb from the 200 samples to compare with the observed data .",
    "the red dots and the blue dots represent the observed data and the simulated data , respectively . from this panel",
    ", we can see that the simulated data and the observed data have similar distributions .",
    "the other three panels b , c and d show the comparisons of the luminosity function , cumulative distribution and @xmath9 distribution between the observed data and mock data .",
    "the red curves show the distributions of the observed data , blue curves give the distributions of all of the 200 pseudo samples of grb data and the blue curves are the mean distributions of the 200 pseudo samples .",
    "we perform the kolmogorov - smirnov test between observed data and the mean distributions of simulated data .",
    "the chance probabilities of the three tests are 0.49 , 0.86 and 0.96 , respectively . from these panels",
    ", we can also conclude that the distribution of the observed data lie in the region of those pseudo data , which means that the derived luminosity function and formation rate of grbs are correct .    in order to test whether long grbs are unbiased tracers of sfr at low redshift",
    ", we simulate 200 new pseudo samples of grbs by assuming that the grb rate follows the sfr from @xcite , i.e. , @xmath147 at @xmath122 , @xmath148 at @xmath109 and @xmath149 at @xmath110 .",
    "then we use the same method to calculate the distributions of these pseudo data .",
    "we find that the cumulative redshift distribution of observed data is not consistent with the pseudo data , which is shown in figure [ comparesfr ] .",
    "the red , blue and green curves have the same meanings as those in figure [ comparedatafig ] . from figure [ comparesfr ] , we can see that part of the cumulative redshift distribution line of observed data lies outside of the region occupied by pseudo grb data , especially at @xmath7 .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test between the distribution from observed data and the mean distribution of simulated data gives the chance probability of @xmath150 .",
    "it means that long grbs are not direct tracers of sfr at @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper , we use lynden - bell s @xmath0 method to study the luminosity function and formation rate of _ swift _ long grbs without any assumptions .",
    "first , we use a @xmath23 statistical method to separate the luminosity evolution from the stable form of the luminosity function by choosing the evolution form @xmath77 .",
    "the most proper @xmath78 is @xmath2 , which gives @xmath76 .",
    "this value is similar with those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . after correcting the luminosity evolution by @xmath151 ,",
    "the cumulative luminosity function @xmath100 and cumulative number distribution @xmath47 of grbs can be calculated , which are shown in figure [ luminosityfunfig ] and figure [ densityfunfig ] .",
    "the luminosity function of grbs can be well fitted with a broken power law form as @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively , where @xmath154 is the break point .",
    "we also derive the formation rate of grbs through the differential form of the cumulative number distribution @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ dphidzfig ] shows the evolution of @xmath155 .",
    "we find that @xmath155 increases quickly at @xmath122 , then remains roughly constant at @xmath109 and finally decreases rapidly at high redshift . from equation ( [ formationrate ] ) , the cosmic formation rate of grbs @xmath94 is derived , which is shown in figure [ formationratefig ] .",
    "the best - fitting power laws for different redshift segments are @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 for @xmath7 , @xmath159 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "our results show that the formation rate of grbs is almost constant at @xmath7 .",
    "but previous results give that the formation rate increases quickly at @xmath118 @xcite . but",
    "@xcite and @xcite used the pseudo redsihfts of grbs rather than the observed redshifts .",
    "besides , we find the @xmath94 in @xcite and @xcite increase fast at @xmath7 , which has the similar behavior of @xmath155 shown in figure [ dphidzfig ] .",
    "so they might omit the @xmath97 term in their calculations . from figure [ sfrfig ] , it is easily to find that grb formation rate @xmath94 is consistent with observed sfr at @xmath8 but entirely different at @xmath7 .",
    "it means that the formation rate of grbs only traces sfr at @xmath8 , which is different with previous work @xcite .",
    "we find the low - redshift excess of grb rate for the first time .",
    "surprisingly , we find that formation rate of grbs is consistent with sfr at @xmath8 , but shows an excess at low redshift @xmath7 for the first time , which is different with previous works .",
    "our result shows that formation rate of grbs is larger than sfr at @xmath7 .",
    "below , we will discuss some possible reasons for this low - redshift excess .",
    "the first one is that the definition of long grbs is not clear . in classical method ,",
    "the long grbs are defined by @xmath11 s @xcite .",
    "there is no clear boundary line in this diagram to separate the long and short grbs .",
    "moreover , @xmath160 is an observed time scale , which represents different time for grbs at different redshifts .",
    "meanwhile , the observations of low - redshift long grbs , such as grb 060614 at @xmath161 and grb 060505 at @xmath162 , show no association of supernovae @xcite .",
    "so more physical criterions are required to classify grbs . because only a subclass of grbs can trace the sfr .",
    "some attempts have been performed @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that grbs can be classified physically into type i ( compact star origin ) and type ii ( massive star origin ) @xcite .",
    "the second one is that some selection effects have not been included in analysis .",
    "for example , it is easier to measure the redshift of those grbs which are in lower redshift and therefore create a bias toward low redshift grbs .",
    "it means that we lose some high redshift grbs , so the formation rate of grbs at low redshift we calculated will larger than the sfr .",
    "this bias can be removed by using samples with high completeness in the grb redshift measurements .",
    "there are three of such a sample in previous literature @xcite .",
    "it could be considered in the future works .",
    "the third one is that there may exist a subclass grbs , i.e. , low - luminosity grbs @xcite . the local rate of low - luminosity grbs may be high , i.e. , @xmath163@xcite , much higher than high - luminosity grbs .",
    "the progenitors of low - luminosity grbs may be different with those of high - luminosity grbs @xcite .",
    "the contamination from low - luminosity grbs could lead to the low - redshift excess .",
