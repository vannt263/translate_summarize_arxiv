    "the first passage time ( fpt ) is the time @xmath0 when a stochastic process @xmath1 leaves an _ a priory _ prescribed domain @xmath2 of its state space for the first time , assumed that @xmath1 has been started at @xmath3 from a given initial value within @xmath2 .",
    "this concept was originally introduced by e. schrdinger when discussing behavior of brownian particles in external fields @xcite .",
    "a large variety of problems ranging from noise in vacuum tubes , chemical reactions and nucleation @xcite to stochastic resonance @xcite , behavior of neurons @xcite , and risk management in finance @xcite can be reduced to fpt problems . in majority of applications",
    "the attractor of the system s dynamics lies inside @xmath2 .",
    "the escape process is characterized by the noise - induced flux through the absorbing boundary of @xmath2 , i.e. by the probability density @xmath4 of the first passage time .",
    "approaches to find @xmath4 are typically based either on the fokker - planck equation with an absorbing boundary @xcite or on the renewal theory @xcite . despite the long history , explicit expressions for the fpt density are known only for a few cases .",
    "these include overdamped particles under the influence of white noise in the force free case , under time - independent constant forces and linear forces @xcite , as well as the case of a constant force under colored noise @xcite .",
    "reasonable approximations exist for a few nonlinear forces @xcite .",
    "the fpt densities of stationary markovian processes have a very habitual form : @xmath4 goes through a single maximum and then it decays either exponentially or as a power law .",
    "many neuronal systems do demonstrate such kind of behavior .",
    "it was shown already in @xcite , that the interspike interval ( isi ) histograms obtained experimentally from output of some neurons can be reproduced by fpt densities of one dimensional diffusion process .",
    "this kind of description is suitable for overdamped systems , where the relaxation time to the attractor @xmath5 is much smaller than the typical first passage time . at first",
    "the local _ quasiequilibrium _ is established in the system .",
    "the escape occurs then from this equilibrium state and follows with a constant rate @xmath6 inversely proportional to the mean fpt .",
    "this situation is closely related to the kramer s problem considering the quasistationary flux over transparent boundary in the low noise limit .",
    "the problem is independent of the detailed initial state and of the time the trajectory has spent inside @xmath2 . at times",
    "@xmath0 exceeding @xmath5 the fpt probability density decays exponentially : @xmath7 .",
    "well known examples are chemical systems and nucleation processes , where the rates determine the mean velocity of chemical reactions or of forming overcritical nuclei @xcite .",
    "another example are the leaky integrate - and - fire and similar neuronal models , where after the reset the corresponding trajectories approach quickly the stable rest state @xcite .",
    "however , if the time scale separation between the relaxation and escape does not hold , the escape can occur before the establishment of the quasiequilibrium and the rates are time dependent .",
    "the first passage time depends sensitively on the initial conditions and the fpt densities have a complex shape different from an exponential decay . in particular",
    "this is the case on short time scales @xmath8 , which attracted growing interest because of recent experiments studying chemical reactions on time scales down to femtoseconds .",
    "the flux over the boundary before the establishment of the quasiequilibrium was found to grow in a stepwise manner , for an underdamped potential system staying initially at the bottom of the well @xcite .",
    "our work is mainly motivated by dynamics of resonant neurons @xcite .",
    "the voltage variable of such a neuron exhibits damped subthreshold oscillations around the attractive rest state .",
    "the characteristic relaxation time to the rest state is large compared to the mean isi .",
    "the escape of the voltage over the excitation threshold is the beginning of a new spike . after spiking",
    "the voltage variable is reset to a fixed value far from the rest state and then it can reach the threshold _ prior _ relaxation to the rest .",
    "the interspike interval densities obtained from the output of resonant neurons show a sequence of decaying peaks separated by intervals whose length is of the order of the period of subthreshold oscillations .",
    "in contrast to the kramer s rate theory we stress again the nonstationary character of this problem due to the reset to sharp initial conditions .    the multimodal isi probability densities can be reproduced in models with different mechanisms of subthreshold resonance : in hodgkin - huxley model @xcite , in excitable fitzhugh - nagumo model with the stable fix point being a focus @xcite or in the region of a canard bifurcation @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that two - component approximations might well mimic the spiking activity of the stochastic hodgkin - huxley system @xcite .",
    "all these models have in common that the multimodal fpt density is obtained for stochastic dynamical systems , which have at least two dynamical variables , exhibit weakly , moderately damped or self - amplifying oscillations and after a spike reset to initial values which are not a fixed point . in the noise - free situation these systems",
    "were denoted resonate - and - fire neurons @xcite .    in the present work we aim to model excitable behavior with damped subthreshold oscillations .",
    "first we present the general exact expression for the fpt density for stochastic processes with differentiable trajectories @xcite .",
    "it results in an infinite series of integrals over joint densities of multiple level crossings .",
    "the later sum stands for a sequential summing of trajectories excluding all except the ones yielding the first passage .",
    "furthermore , we discuss approximations for fpt densities , which are based either on truncation of this series , or on its approximate summation based on decoupling .",
    "we prove the quality of different approximations by explicit calculations for an underdamped harmonic oscillator driven by white or colored gaussian noise , representing the stochastic resonate - and - fire neurons .",
    "consider a single random variable @xmath1 , whose @xmath9-dependence is assumed to be differentiable .",
    "the first passage problem for @xmath1 to a boundary @xmath10 is a special case of a level crossing problem .",
    "the general theory of level crossings by a random process was originally put forward by s.o .",
    "rice @xcite .",
    "he derived an expression for the probability density of recurrence of a stationary random process to a given level in form of the so called wiener - rice series @xcite .",
    "the exact expression for the first passage time probability density eq.([e : fptmostgeneral ] ) is analogous to the wiener - rice series and was discussed in @xcite , where the main result , our eq.([e : fptmostgeneral ] ) , was proved .",
    "we proceed by giving a much more elementary derivation of eq.([e : fptmostgeneral ] ) which serves as the main instrument in our further investigations .",
    "let us first discuss the probability @xmath11 that a continuous differentiable process @xmath1 crosses the level @xmath10 in a time interval between @xmath9 and @xmath12 with positive velocity @xmath13 under initial conditions @xmath14 .",
    "generally the whole set of variables resulting from the markovian embedding of @xmath1 should be given at @xmath3 .",
    "for simplicity we consider two dimensional dynamics , generalization for the higher dimensional systems is obvious . crossing the level with positive velocity will be referred to as an upcrossing in what follows .    if @xmath1 crosses the barrier within time interval @xmath15 with velocity @xmath16 , then the value of coordinate at time @xmath9 should lie in interval @xmath17 .",
    "the probability that @xmath1 is in this interval equals @xmath18 .",
    "now , the velocity value at the instant of crossing is positive but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "thus we obtain the probability density of an upcrossing by integration over all positive @xmath19 : @xmath20 eq .",
    "( [ e : rice ] ) can be simply generalized to give the expression for the joint probability density of multiple upcrossings .",
    "the probability @xmath21 , that the process @xmath1 crosses the level @xmath10 in each of @xmath22 time intervals @xmath23 is given by : @xmath24    in what follows we omit @xmath10 and initial conditions in expressions for the joint densities of upcrossings .",
    "the transition probability densities are connected with joint probability densities according to bayes theorem : @xmath25    our aim now is to calculate the first passage time probability density @xmath4 , that is the fraction of all trajectories starting from the initial point @xmath26 with initial velocity @xmath27 which perform the upcrossing of the barrier at time @xmath0 and this upcrossing is the first one .",
    "all such trajectories are accounted for in probability density @xmath28 ( see the first row in fig . [",
    "f : countingcrossings ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath28 also accounts for trajectories for which the upcrossing at time @xmath0 was not the first one , i.e. which had another upcrossing at some earlier time @xmath29 ( row 2 in fig .",
    "[ f : countingcrossings ] ) .",
    "such trajectories should not contribute to @xmath4 , therefore we should substract them from @xmath28 . taking into account",
    "that @xmath30 can be arbitrary between @xmath31 and @xmath0 , we get : @xmath32 this excludes all trajectories which cross @xmath10 exactly twice until @xmath0 .",
    "however , eq.([e:2terms ] ) does not fully solve the problem since the trajectories crossing @xmath10 three times , i.e at time @xmath0 and at two earlier moments @xmath33 ( row 3 in fig .",
    "[ f : countingcrossings ] ) , are not accounted for correctly .",
    "each such trajectory is counted once in @xmath28 . the second term in eq.([e:2terms ] ) accounts for the pairs of upcrossings at @xmath0 and at some @xmath34 .",
    "each trajectory with two additional upcrossings at @xmath33 is therefore subtracted twice in @xmath35 .",
    "such trajectories should not contribute to @xmath4 : in eq .",
    "( [ e:2terms ] ) we subtracted too much and have to add the amount of trajectories with three upcrossings at times @xmath36 and @xmath0 again : @xmath37 the factor @xmath38 in the last term accounts for the number of permutations of variables @xmath39 .",
    "generally , if a trajectory crosses the level at time @xmath0 and at @xmath40 earlier times @xmath41 , then in @xmath42 it is accounted for exactly @xmath43 times ( @xmath43 stands for the number of combinations ) .",
    "note , that @xmath44 .",
    "thus in the alternating sum of the kind eqs.([e:2terms ] ) , ( [ e:3terms ] ) containing @xmath45 terms , all trajectories crossing @xmath10 at time @xmath0 and having @xmath46 additional upcrossings are excluded , however the ones with the larger number of upcrossings are not accounted for correctly . extending the sum to infinity",
    "we exclude all superfluous trajectories , and only trajectories , for which the upcrossing at time @xmath0 was the first one , remain .",
    "thus the expression for the first passage time probability density reads : @xmath47    explicitly expressing the joint densities of upcrossings using eqs.([e : ricejoint]),([e : bayes ] ) , we get @xmath48    eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) connects @xmath4 , i.e. the solution of the fpt problem with absorbing boundary at @xmath10 , with all joint densities of upcrossings for the unbounded process . to obtain @xmath49",
    "we consider trajectories , which are not absorbed at @xmath10 , but can return after an upcrossing and then cross @xmath10 again and again . the right combination of all these densities of multiple level crossings results in the probability density for the first upcrossing .",
    "an alternative to direct summation of infinite series eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) is based on an analogue to a cumulant expansion .",
    "the times , when the random process @xmath1 performs upcrossings of @xmath10 form a _ point process _ , or a _ system of random points _ @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath50 are the _ distribution functions _ of the point process .",
    "since @xmath1 has finite velocity , the interval between two upcrossings can not be arbitrary small and so @xmath51 vanishes if two of its arguments coincide .",
    "such random point process is called a _ system of nonapproaching points _ @xcite . in this context",
    "@xmath4 is interpreted as the waiting - time density of the point process .",
    "the last is the probability density for the time @xmath0 when the first event occur .",
    "the system of random points is completely characterized by its cumulant functions @xmath52 choose an arbitrary natural number @xmath53 , and then fix @xmath53 arbitrary numbers @xmath54 and @xmath53 positive times @xmath55 .",
    "the cumulant functions are then defined by the relation @xmath56    we obtain the explicit relations between cumulant and distribution functions of the point process if we differentiate both sides of eq.([e : corrfuncgeneral ] ) over all @xmath57 and then set @xmath58 , i.e. if we apply the operator @xmath59 . doing so sequentially for @xmath60 we get @xmath61 here @xmath62 denotes the operation of symmetrization of the expression in the brackets with respect to all permutations of its arguments .",
    "the coefficients in these forms are the same as in relations between the moments and the cumulants of a random variable .",
    "the relation eq.([e : corrfuncgeneral ] ) does not change its form if we choose different times @xmath63 , different values @xmath64 or change the number @xmath53 . thus extending @xmath53 to infinity , allowing @xmath9 to take all possible values between @xmath31 and @xmath0 , and choosing @xmath65 we get from eq.([e : corrfuncgeneral ] )",
    "@xmath66    it is easy to verify , that the derivative @xmath67 of the expression on the left hand side of eq.([e : corrfuncintegral ] ) is exactly the expression on the right hand side of eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) . thus differentiating the right hand side of eq.([e : corrfuncintegral ] ) over @xmath0 we obtain the expression for the waiting - time density @xmath4 through the cumulant functions of the point process : @xmath68 with @xmath69    eqs.([e : pointproccorrf])-([e : corrfuncintegral ] ) are general expressions which hold for systems of random points , defined by distribution functions eq.([e : pointprocdistr ] ) of any kind .",
    "so are also eqs.([e : fptgeneral ] ) and ( [ e : genform ] ) , ( [ e : sexact ] ) , which give the waiting - time density for arbitrary point process . in particular , for the random points being the times , when a differentiable random process crosses the level @xmath10 , the distribution functions @xmath70 are given by the joint densities of upcrossings eq.([e : ricejoint ] ) .",
    "then eqs.([e : fptgeneral ] ) and ( [ e : genform ] ) , ( [ e : sexact ] ) together with eq.([e : ricejoint ] ) express the first passage time density for this differentiable random process .",
    "the function @xmath71 can be interpreted as a the time - dependent escape rate .",
    "these are the exact results for the fpt probability density of any continuous differentiable random process .",
    "though these results were employed for mathematical proofs , up to our knowledge these infinite series of multiple integrals was never used for explicit calculations .",
    "we proceed to show , that eqs.([e : fptgeneral ] ) and ( [ e : genform ] ) , ( [ e : sexact ] ) can be a starting point for several approximations . as often in the case of infinite series , the useful approximations can be based either on the truncation of the series after several first terms calculated exactly , or by approximation of the higher order terms through the lower order ones what might lead to a closed analytical form .",
    "truncation approximations for eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) are not normalized , hold only on short time scales , and diverge at longer times ( due to the miscount of trajectories with several upcrossings ) .",
    "the approximations of the second type are based on a subsummation in eq.([e : sexact ] ) for @xmath72 .",
    "they are normalized and can be used in the whole time domain .",
    "note , only approximations guaranteeing positive rates @xmath73 are reasonable .",
    "thus the set of possible approximations for the series eq.([e : sexact ] ) is rather restricted .",
    "the model we have in mind is the resonate - and - fire model of a neuron @xcite .",
    "this is the least complicated model accounting for the resonant properties of neurons in terms of an equivalent rlc circuit @xcite . in this way it is directly related to the leaky integrate - and - fire model also based on the electrical analogy .",
    "alternatively the model can be interpreted as a systematic and linearized reduction of hodgkin - huxley type dynamics @xcite . for the sake of simplicity we neglect the absolute refractory time . under this assumption",
    "the model is equivalent to the underdamped harmonic oscillator with the threshold and reset , what makes the results applicable in many other domains of science .",
    "we change by time scale and variable transformations to dimensionless parameters and variables .",
    "the dynamics of the voltage variable @xmath1 is given by : @xmath74 we fix the frequency @xmath75 , choose initial conditions for @xmath76 and its velocity @xmath19 to be @xmath77 and set the threshold at @xmath78 .",
    "in the present paper we consider two types of noisy drive : ( i ) the white noise @xmath79 , and ( ii ) the ornstein - uhlenbeck noise @xmath80 , with @xmath81 being the white gaussian noise of intensity 1 .",
    "first we concentrate on the case ( i ) of white noise driving .    because of the linearity of the system eq.([e : harmoscil ] )",
    "all joint probability densities are gaussian and have the form @xcite : @xmath82 here @xmath83 is an @xmath84-dimensional vector , whose @xmath85th component is the value of coordinate @xmath86 or of velocity @xmath87 at the moment @xmath39 .",

    "the first passage time density @xmath4 for the harmonic oscillator driven by white gaussian noise obtained from simulations is depicted with black crosses in fig.[f : fptg0.01d0.02 ] .",
    "parameters are chosen to be @xmath111 . in this case of very small friction the correlation functions of the process oscillate with period @xmath112 and decay slowly within the relaxation time @xmath113 .",
    "a typical trajectory is smooth and shows almost regular oscillations with fluctuating phase and amplitude .",
    "the probability to reach @xmath10 is higher in the maxima of the subthreshold oscillations .",

    "shorter time scales @xmath114 shows the multiple peaks following with the frequency of damped oscillations @xmath115 . on long times",
    "@xmath116 the quasiequilibrium establishes and fpt density decays exponentially .",
    "the number of visible peaks depends on the relation between @xmath5 and the period of oscillations @xmath117 and is given by the number of periods elapsing before the quasiequilibrium is achieved . for parameter values as in fig.[f :",
    "fptg0.01d0.02 ] @xmath118 , what corresponds to about 30 periods @xmath119 .",
    "let us consider truncation approximations for the series eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) .",
    "the first approximation is given by the first term @xmath28 , the second approximation by 2 terms , eq.([e:2terms ] ) , and the third by 3 terms , eq.([e:3terms ] ) .",
    "the higher order approximations entail the numerical estimation of highdimensional integrals , which at some stage leads to a computational effort larger than the one necessary for a direct simulation . therefore we restrict ourselves to the 1- , 2- and 3- terms approximations .",
    "the result of the 1 term approximation is shown in fig.[f : fptg0.01d0.02](a ) with a gray line .",
    "the first peak of the fpt density is reproduced almost exactly .",
    "all further peaks are overestimated , because all trajectories performing multiple upcrossings of @xmath10 are included . on long times",
    "the process becomes stationary and the first approximation tends to a constant value @xmath120 .",
    "this is the mean frequency of upcrossings for a stationary process , also known as the rice frequency @xcite .",
    "the general expression for @xmath121 reads @xmath122 [ e : freqcrossho ] in our case of a harmonic oscillator driven by white noise @xmath123 . in the stationary regime",
    "the mean interval between two consecutive upcrossing @xmath124 is given by the inverse of the rice frequency @xmath125 .",
    "for the chosen parameter values @xmath126 .    the second approximation ( gray line in fig.[f : fptg0.01d0.02](b ) ) reproduces almost exactly the first two peaks of fpt density .",
    "then it becomes negative , because in eq.([e:2terms ] ) trajectories performing 2 and more superfluous upcrossings are subtracted too many times .",
    "moreover the second approximation tends to minus infinity for @xmath127 .",
    "the third approximation reproduces well the three first peaks of @xmath4 , and then diverges tending to plus infinity .",
    "note that the mean first passage time obtained numerically equals @xmath128 for these parameter values , and the median of the distribution lies by @xmath129 .",
    "thus the first three approximations reproduce the most part of the fpt probability density .",
    "the behavior of @xmath4 for the harmonic oscillator with higher damping @xmath130 , stronger noise intensity @xmath131 , and other parameters as in fig.[f : fptg0.01d0.02 ] is presented in fig.[f : fptg0.80d0.44 ] .",
    "for these parameter values the relaxation time @xmath132 is less than the period @xmath133 .",
    "therefore the fpt density is practically monomodal with a single maximum and a small shoulder separating it from the exponential tail .",
    "the numerically obtained @xmath4 is shown with gray crosses , the 1 term truncation with a dot line , the 2 terms truncation with a dashed line , and the 3 terms truncation with a solid line .",
    "the truncation approximations reproduce again the most part of the distribution : the mean fpt equals 13.1 and the median lies by 9.1 .",
    "thus the truncation approximations reproduce the fpt density on short times but are not normalized and diverge on large times .",
    "however , one can force the normalization in truncations as follows @xmath134 here @xmath135 is a truncated series for the fpt density , it is given by eqs.([e : rice]),([e:2terms ] ) , and ( [ e:3terms ] ) for 1,2 , and 3 terms truncations respectively .",
    "@xmath136 is the heaviside step function : the expression eq.([e : truncnorm ] ) turns to zero as soon as the integral over the absolute value of @xmath135 exceeds 1 .    in fig.[f :",

    "simulation results are shown with crosses , and approximations obtained from eq.([e : truncnorm ] ) with 1,2 , and 3 terms by solid lines . the probability distributed over the long exponential tail in the real fpt density ,",
    "is concentrated in the positive artefact posed on intermediate times in the normalized truncations .",
    "hence the mean fpt computed from such approximations is always strongly underestimated .",
    "the more terms are included , the more precise truncations become .",
    "however one has to confine oneself to a few terms , since the calculation of higher order terms implies the computation of multiple integrals and is not more effective than simulations .",
    "therefore the truncation approximations are good , when the most part of the fpt probability is concentrated in the first few peaks , i.e. when the barrier value is low or the noise is strong .",
    "decoupling approximations for eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) or eq.([e : sexact ] ) are based on approximate expressions of the higher order terms through the lower order ones , what may lead to a closed analytical form .",
    "thereby infinitely many approximate terms are included .    the simplest way to obtain such",
    "an approximation is to neglect all correlations between upcrossings .",
    "this means to neglect all terms in eq.([e : sexact ] ) except for the first one , and leads to @xmath137    equivalently , neglecting all correlations corresponds to the factorization of @xmath138 into a product of one - point densities @xmath139 in eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) .",
    "then the series , eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) sums up into @xmath140 , which is equivalent to eqs.([e : genform]),([e : hertz ] ) .",
    "this approximation will be refereed to as the _ hertz approximation _ since the form of @xmath141 resembles the hertz distribution @xcite .",
    "it is an approximation of first order , since it takes the first term of the series exactly , and all other terms are approximated through this first one .",
    "the second order approximation should therefore account the first and the second terms exactly and approximate all higher terms through these two .",
    "the general form of @xmath4 in terms of the cumulant functions eq.([e : genform ] ) ensures the right normalization , irrespective of the way how @xmath72 is approximated .",
    "however the simple truncation of the series eq.([e : sexact ] ) after the second term does not ensure the positive escape rate @xmath73 .",
    "the second order approximation guaranteeing @xmath142 was proposed by stratonovich in the context of peak duration @xcite .",
    "the first and the second cumulant functions are taken exactly , and the higher ones are approximated by the combinations of these two : @xmath143 here @xmath62 is again the operation of symmetrization .",
    "@xmath144 is the correlation coefficient of upcrossings @xmath145 note , that @xmath146 and @xmath147 for large values of @xmath148 .",
    "the approximation of the cumulant functions in form eq.([e : corrfuncapp ] ) can be motivated by the following argument .",
    "consider eq.([e : corrfuncgeneral ] ) with @xmath149 . recall that the joint densities of upcrossings vanish for coinciding arguments : @xmath150 .",
    "thus it follows from eq.([e : corrfuncgeneral ] ) : @xmath151    the above expression should hold for arbitrary @xmath152 . therefore expanding the logarithm in series , and equating the coefficients by the same powers of @xmath152 on the both sides , one obtains the identity @xmath153 eq.([e : corrfunccoinc ] ) is exact for all arguments coinciding .",
    "eq.([e : corrfuncapp ] ) gives a correction to it , when the arguments differ .",
    "substitution of eq.([e : corrfuncapp ] ) into eq.([e : sexact ] ) delivers then the _ stratonovich approximation _ for @xmath4 in form eq.([e : genform ] ) , now with the time - dependent escape rate being @xmath154 } { \\int_0^t r(t , t^{\\prime } ) n_{1}(t^{\\prime } ) dt^{\\prime } } dt .",

    "fptunderdamped ] and [ f : fptoverdamped ] the fpt probability density obtained from simulations is depicted with a gray line , the hertz approximation eq.([e : hertz ] ) with a black dashed line , and the stratonovich approximation eq.([e : straton ] ) with a black solid line .    in fig.[f : fptunderdamped](a ) the parameters are chosen to be @xmath163 , corresponding to moderate friction and moderate noise intensity . for given parameter values @xmath132 and @xmath164 , so that @xmath156 , both hertz and stratonovich approximations hold and reproduce well the fpt density in the whole time domain .    in the case of moderate friction and stronger noise",
    "the upcrossings become more frequent and @xmath124 decreases .",
    "the fpt changes its form to practically monomodal .",
    "an example is given in fig.[f : fptunderdamped](b ) with @xmath165 which correspond to @xmath132 and @xmath166 .",
    "the stratonovich approximation complies very well with simulations , while the hertz approximation fails to reproduce the details of the distribution : it underestimates @xmath4 on short times , and shows slower exponential decay in the tail than the one observed in simulations ( see the inset ) .    finally , for small friction and week noise the upcrossings are rare , but the relaxation time is large .",
    "the fpt probability density exhibits multiple decaying peaks . in fig.[f : fptunderdamped](c ) @xmath167 corresponding to @xmath168 .",
    "again , the stratonovich approximation performs well , while the hertz approximation underestimates the first peak , overestimates all further peaks and decays in the tail faster than the simulated fpt density .    for the large @xmath0",
    ", @xmath4 decays exponentially , @xmath169 .",
    "the decrement of this decay is obtained from long time asymptotic : @xmath170 .",
    "thus , in the hertz approximation eq.([e : hertz ] ) one gets @xmath171 .",
    "the behavior in the stratonovich approximation eq.([e : straton ] ) is determined by @xmath172 with @xmath173 given by @xmath174 .",
    "note that @xmath173 is not necessary positive because of oscillating correlation coefficient . inserting this expression into eq.([e : straton ] ) and expanding the logarithm up to the second term we get @xmath175 providing the second order correction to @xmath176 . the value of @xmath173 for the parameter set as in fig.[f : fptunderdamped](a ) is @xmath177 , for parameters as in fig.[f : fptunderdamped](b ) @xmath178 , and for parameters as in fig .",
    "[ f : fptunderdamped](c ) @xmath179 .",
    "the long time asymptotic obtained with these @xmath173 values reproduce fairly well the decay patterns found numerically .    in the overdamped regime ( @xmath95 )",
    "the condition @xmath180 is always fulfilled .",
    "nevertheless the validity region of our approximations is limited . with increasing friction the process @xmath1 approaches to the markovian one ( it is markovian in the overdamped limit @xmath181 ) . for such processes",
    "the pattern of upcrossings is not homogeneous , but shows rather well separated clusters of upcrossings @xcite .",
    "essentially in the markovian limit the property , that upcrossings form a system of _ nonapproaching _ random points is violated .",
    "the upcrossings within a single cluster are not independent even if their mean density @xmath121 is low , so that the quality of approximations decreases .",
    "this fact is illustrated in fig.[f : fptoverdamped ] . in the overdamped regime the correlation functions decay monotonously , and the fpt densities are always monomodal .",
    "the parameters in fig.[f : fptoverdamped](a ) are @xmath182 , so that @xmath183 .",
    "eqs.([e : genform]),([e : straton ] ) continue to give a good approximation for @xmath4 , while the hertz approximation becomes inaccurate .",
    "further increase in friction , for example @xmath184 as in fig.[f : fptoverdamped](b ) corresponding to @xmath185 , makes the process to approach the markovian limit .",
    "the stratonovich approximation starts to be inaccurate , and the hertz approximation fails .",
    "in the two previous sections we have seen , that truncation approximations reproduce the fpt density on short time scales . in contrast , the decoupling approximations reproduce fpt densities in the whole time domain and posses the right normalization . at the first glance , it may seem that the decoupling approximations excel the direct truncations and should be preferably used in applications .",
    "however , it depends on the problem one has to solve , and sometimes the truncations turn out to be useful .",
    "one such situation was already mentioned .",
    "if the noise intensity is high or the barrier value is low , then the upcrossings occur frequently , and the decoupling approximations can not be applied .",
    "for example , for parameter values as in fig.[f : fptg0.01d0.02 ] , the relaxation time is @xmath118 , and the mean interval between upcrossings @xmath186 .",
    "thus @xmath187 , and both hertz and stratonovich approximations fail .",
    "nevertheless , the most part of the fpt density is concentrated in the first few peaks in this case , and is well reproduced by the truncation approximations , as shown in figs.[f : fptg0.01d0.02 ] and [ f : fptg0.01d0.02lsg ] .",
    "one can also be interested in a very accurate approximation for the fpt density on short times .",
    "the truncations deliver better results on short times than the decoupling approximations .",
    "for example , in fig.[f : str3terms ] the simulation results are compared with the 3 terms truncation and the stratonovich approximation for the same parameter values as in fig.[f : fptunderdamped](c ) .",
    "both approximation reproduce very accurate the first peak in the fpt density .",
    "however , the 3 terms truncation is much more accurate in estimation of the second and third peaks ( see the inset in fig.[f : str3terms ] ) .",
    "this can be easily understood .",
    "the stratonovich approximation takes @xmath188 and @xmath189 exactly , and approximates all higher order densities through these two . on times ,",
    "when the first peak occurs , @xmath189 is negligibly small .",
    "then from eqs.([e : corrfuncapp]),([e : corcoef ] ) we obtain @xmath190 .",
    "substitution of this expression into eq.([e : corrfuncgeneral ] ) gives then @xmath191 for @xmath192 .",
    "thus on these times the stratonovich approximation just coincides with the 1 term truncation , and so reproduces the first peak very accurately . on times ,",
    "when the second peak in the fpt density occurs , @xmath189 is significantly different from zero .",
    "hence all approximated @xmath193 turn out to be nonvanishing as well , while the real values for these functions are negligibly small on these times .",
    "thus the accuracy of the stratonovich approximation decreases in the second peak . from analogous reasoning",
    "it becomes clear , that the hertz approximation is already inaccurate in estimation of the first peak .",
    "expressions eq.([e : fptgeneral ] ) and eqs.([e : genform]),([e : straton ] ) can be used to obtain the fpt density for a random process @xmath1 , if the joint probability densities of @xmath76 and its velocity @xmath19 eq.([e : ricejoint ] ) exist .",
    "thus it is necessary that the process @xmath1 is continuous and differentiable at any time , but there are no further restrictions on dimension and form of the system .",
    "the truncation and decoupling approximations deliver good results for the fpt density in their validity regions independently of the character of the noisy drive . in particular the case of correlated input signals ( colored noise driving )",
    "is of importance in neuroscience .",
    "for example , synaptic filtering of the input spike train may lead to an exponentially correlated input signal .",
    "therefore we consider as another example a resonate - and - fire neuron eq.([e : harmoscil ] ) driven by the ornstein - uhlenbeck noise .",
    "the correlation time of the process is @xmath194 , the variance @xmath195 , and the correlation function @xmath196 . in the limit @xmath197 the process tends to the white noise of intensity @xmath198 .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath199 can be obtained using fourier transform as it was done for the white noise case in section [ s : model ] .",
    "then @xmath28 is again obtained analytically and has the form given by eq.([e:1termexpl ] ) . now @xmath200 are elements of the inverse correlation matrix @xmath201 , @xmath202 are components of vector @xmath203 .",
    "the factor @xmath204 is defined in the same way as it was done in section [ s : model ] .    for simplicity , we assumed sharp initial conditions for the noise variable , i.e. @xmath205 is reset after every spike to a fixed value @xmath206 . the alternative assumption , that the neuron variables @xmath207 are reset to their initial values once @xmath1 reaches the thereshold _ without _ resetting @xmath208 , might be more realistic @xcite . in this case",
    "all probability densities should be averaged with respect to the stationary density of noise values _ upon firing_. however , as an example , we confine ourselves to consideration of sharp initial conditions for the noise : @xmath209 .    in fig.[f",
    ": fptou ] we show simulated fpt probability density and the hertz approximation for the harmonic oscillator driven by the ornstein - uhlenbeck noise .",
    "we choose two different values of the correlation time : @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the reset value for the noise is @xmath212 , and other parameters are as in fig.[f : fptunderdamped](a ) .",
    "the noise intensity decreases with increasing @xmath194 , hence the mean fpt growth . though @xmath4 preserves its structure as a whole , for larger values of @xmath194 the height of the main peak decreases and the weight of the exponential tail growth . for given values of the correlation time @xmath213 and @xmath214",
    "respectively , what significantly exceeds @xmath5 .",
    "thus in both cases the hertz approximation is absolutely sufficient .",
    "motivated by studies of resonant neurons , we consider the first passage time problem for systems with subthreshold oscillations and nonnegligible relaxation times after a reset .",
    "the joint densities of multiple upcrossings for such a process @xmath1 can be obtained in the case of differentiable trajectories . the fpt density for @xmath1",
    "is expressed in terms of an infinite series of multiple integrals over all joint densities of upcrossings , or equivalently , in terms of the cumulant functions .",
    "we consider two types of approximations for this infinite series .",
    "the truncation approximations include the first few terms of the series calculated exactly .",
    "they reproduce well the fpt density on short and intermidiate times and can be used , when the most part of the fpt probability is concentrated in the first few peaks , i.e. when the barrier value is low or the noise is strong .",
    "the decoupling approximations can be derived for the case of weakly correlated upcrossings .",
    "the higher order cumulant functions are expressed through the lower order ones , and then infinitely many terms sum up to the closed expression for @xmath4 . the hertz approximation ( the one neglecting all correlations between upcrossings ) is absolutely sufficient for the case of moderate friction and moderate noise intensity .",
    "the stratonovich approximation ( approximating the higher order cumulant functions through the first and the second ones ) performs even better and does not loose the accuracy for high noise intensities or in the slightly overdamped regime .",
    "we illustrate our results by the noise driven harmonic oscillator , with the threshold value at @xmath10 and reset to sharp initial conditions , i.e. the resonate - and - fire model of a neuron .",
    "the validity regions of the approximations cover all different types of subthreshold dynamics .",
    "thus the approximations reproduce all qualitatively different structures of the fpt densities : from monomodal through bimodal to multimodal densities with several decaying peaks .",
    "the approximations hold for systems of whatever dimension .",
    "we illustrate this by the harmonic oscillator driven by the ornstein - uhlenbeck noise .",
    "though we applied the theory to the harmonic oscillator ( resonate - and - fire model ) , the linearity of the system is in general not required .",
    "the joint distributions of @xmath1 and its velocity should exist , i.e. @xmath1 should be differentiable in time .",
    "no further restrictions on the form and dimension of the system are implied .",
