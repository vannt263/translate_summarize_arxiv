    "large attention has been paid in recent years to the fascinating properties of macroscopic samples of atoms or molecules prepared in a specific linear combination of quantum states @xcite .",
    "such media are said to be coherently prepared and its statistical ( macroscopic ) description corresponds to a density matrix with nonzero off - diagonal ( coherence ) terms . a wide variety of physical consequences of coherently prepared media have been observed and many crucial applications achieved @xcite .",
    "a few examples are : coherence population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite successfully exploited for sub - recoil laser cooling @xcite . electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and the related topic of laser without inversion @xcite .",
    "enhancement of optical nonlinearities @xcite and efficient frequency generation @xcite .",
    "very large dispersion @xcite and its application to sensitive magnetometry @xcite and optical propagation with slow group velocity @xcite .",
    "most experiments and theoretical modelling on cpt , eit and related coherence effects deal with three level systems in a @xmath4 configuration where the two long - living lower levels have different energies .",
    "this requires the consideration of two distinct optical fields ( coupling and probe fields ) acting on either arms of the @xmath4 system .",
    "however , interesting energy level configurations for coherent spectroscopy purposes can also be obtained using the zeeman sublevels of a degenerate two - level atomic transition .",
    "the coherent spectroscopy of degenerate two - level systems ( dtls ) was recently explored using mutually coherent optical fields @xcite .",
    "a new coherent effect emerged corresponding to a resonant increase of the atomic absorption .",
    "such effect was designated electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) .",
    "eia is observed in dtls in closed transitions with a higher degeneracy in the upper level @xcite .",
    "recently , coherent resonances in dtls were used to produce very slow positive and negative @xcite group velocity and to obtain `` light storage '' @xcite .",
    "a major advantage of the use of dtls is that a single optical field may be enough to induce coherent effects .",
    "indeed , the two orthogonal polarization components ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) of the same linearly polarized optical wave couple different zeeman sublevels of the ground and excited state .",
    "the raman resonance condition between ground state sublevels is then automatically reached at perfect ground state degeneracy or destroyed by the application of a static magnetic field . as a result ,",
    "the atomic response of a dtls to the excitation by a single optical field with linear polarization presents sharp variations as a function of the magnetic field around zero magnetic field .",
    "this is in essence the well known ( ground state ) hanle effect @xcite intimately connected to the zeeman optical pumping @xcite .",
    "cpt and hanle effects were theoretically and experimentally analyzed within a common frame by renzoni and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they studied the hyperfine ( open ) transitions of the @xmath7 line of na .",
    "this work was followed by theoretical investigation of hanle / cpt resonances in open transitions @xcite .",
    "hanle / cpt resonances were also studied on the @xmath7 and @xmath8 lines of rb in a vapor cell experiment .",
    "inverted hanle resonances ( increased absorption ) were then observed in the case of @xmath9 transitions @xcite .",
    "these resonances are related to the eia effect previously reported in @xcite .",
    "a theoretical investigation of the enhanced absorption hanle resonances has recently been presented in @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of eit signals was theoretically analyzed by li and coworkers @xcite and experimentally investigated by chen _",
    "et al_. @xcite for strong coupling field intensity .",
    "the low driving field intensity case was initially considered in @xcite .",
    "the influence of several relaxation mechanisms such as time - of - flight , dephasing collisions and velocity changing collisions was studied in @xcite .",
    "a refined treatment of the influence of the time - of - flight on the transient atomic response in coherence resonances was discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with the study of the temporal evolution of the hanle signal as the raman resonance condition between the optical field and the ground state zeeman sublevels is suddenly achieved or destroyed by turning off or on a static longitudinal magnetic field .",
    "we focus on the comparison between the temporal evolution of the hanle / eit ( reduced absorption ) and hanle / eia  ( increased absorption ) resonances at various driving field intensities .",
    "the experiments were carried on the @xmath0 lines of rb in a vapor cell .",
    "although we studied both stable rb isotopes , only the results concerning @xmath10rb will be presented here .",
    "the two cases ( hanle / eit or hanle / eia resonances ) can be observed depending on which ground state hyperfine level is excited . as already pointed out @xcite , the atomic response when the lower alkaline atom ground state hyperfine level is excited corresponds , at the raman resonance , to increased transparency ( eit ) .",
    "conversely , the response obtained when the upper ground state hyperfine level is excited results in an inverted hanle resonance corresponding to an increase of the atomic absorption ( eia ) .",
    "for an eit type transition , the transient following the cancellation of the magnetic field can be interpreted as the falling of the atomic system into the uncoupled or dark state ( ds ) . for an eia type transition",
    ", the transient corresponds to the atomic system evolving towards the enhanced absorption state ( eas ) @xcite .",
    "we have also studied the transients occurring when the raman resonance condition is suddenly modified by the application of a magnetic field producing a zeeman shift of the ground state sublevels which is larger than the coherence resonance width at low light intensity but smaller than the excited state width .",
    "this transient evolution correspond to the system leaving the ds or the eas in the case of eit or eia type transitions respectively .",
    "the experiments are described in the next section of the paper .",
    "section three is devoted to the discussion of the experimental results in view of a theoretical model of the atomic evolution .",
    "section four presents the conclusions of this work .",
    "the experimental setup scheme is shown in fig . [ setup ] . a @xmath11 long glass cell containing a mixture of @xmath12rb and @xmath10rb vapor and no buffer gas was used .",
    "the cell was slightly heated above room temperature to obtain around @xmath13 resonant absorption .",
    "the cell was placed inside a cylindrical coil for magnetic field control .",
    "the coil and the cell were placed inside a cylindrical @xmath14-metal shield to reduce magnetic fields components perpendicular to the cylindrical coil axis to less than @xmath15 .",
    "the atomic sample was illuminated with a @xmath16 laser beam issued from an injection locked diode laser ( linewidth @xmath17 ) whose frequency could be tuned and stabilized along the rb @xmath0 lines ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the precise laser frequency position was monitored with respect to an auxiliary saturated absorption setup .",
    "the laser light was spatially filtered using a @xmath19 long single mode optical fiber .",
    "the linearly polarized laser propagated along the direction of the magnetic coil axis .",
    "the intensity of the light was controlled with neutral density filters .",
    "an iris diaphragm placed before the cell defined the beam cross section at the atomic sample . a second diaphragm , with smaller diameter , placed after the cell selects the central part of the transmitted beam .",
    "the transmission was monitored with an avalanche photodiode ( @xmath20 bandwidth ) and recorded in a digitizing oscilloscope .    to study the transient behavior of the hanle / eit(/eia )",
    "resonances the longitudinal magnetic field was periodically switched between two different constant values @xmath21 and @xmath22 while observing the temporal variation of the transmitted light power . for this",
    ", the coil current was driven by the square - wave output of a signal generator at @xmath23 .",
    "after being switched on or off the magnetic field reached a new stationary value in approximately @xmath24 during the recording of the absorption transients , the iris diaphragm placed after the cell had a diameter at least a factor of two smaller than the diameter of the iris placed before the cell and defining the beam cross section . by this means , one ensures that the collected light originates from atoms whose transverse path across the cylindrical light beam is close to a diameter . for these atoms the mean transverse transit time across the beam",
    "can be estimated as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the beam diameter , @xmath27 the vapor temperature , @xmath28 the boltzman constant and @xmath29 the atom mass ( for rb @xmath30  @xmath31 for @xmath32  and @xmath33 ) .",
    "the transient absorption records obtained for eit and eia type transitions are shown in figs .",
    "[ intensdepeit ] and [ intensdepeia ] respectively .",
    "when the magnetic field is switched off , the atomic system evolves exponentially towards a new steady state which corresponds to the ds in the case of an eit type transition or the eas in the case of an eia type transition .",
    "a quite different behavior is observed when the magnetic field is suddenly restored .",
    "the evolution towards the new steady state is then a damped oscillation at a frequency given by twice the ground state zeeman frequency produced by the magnetic field .",
    "this oscillation corresponds to the larmor precession of the coherently prepared ds or eas in the presence of the static magnetic field .",
    "notice the opposite phase corresponding to the eit and eia type transitions .",
    "[ intensdepeit ] and [ intensdepeia ] present the variations with light intensity of the transient evolutions of eit and eia type transitions respectively . in these series ,",
    "the laser beam diameter is kept fixed at @xmath34 while its intensity is varied with neutral density filters .",
    "the plots have been rescaled in order to present the same difference between the two steady states regimes . at all",
    "intensities , the transient evolution towards the steady state regime with @xmath35 is well described by an exponential decay .",
    "similar decay times are observed at @xmath35 for a given laser intensity for eit and eia  type transitions .",
    "this is still the case of the @xmath2 transients at low intensities , the damping of the oscillating transients occur with similar characteristic decay rates for the eit and eia  type transitions .",
    "these rates , which are also comparable to the @xmath35 exponential decay rates observed for the same light intensity are of same magnitude than the inverse of the estimated time - of - flight across the light beam .",
    "significant differences between the eit and eia transients arise for  @xmath36 as the light intensity is increased . in the eia type transition ( fig .",
    "[ intensdepeia ] ) increasing the light intensity results in a faster damping of the oscillating transient .",
    "the damping rate of the oscillation closely follows the exponential decay rate of the corresponding @xmath35 transient .",
    "the behavior is rather different for the @xmath2 transient in the eit type transition . in this case",
    "the temporal evolution significantly deviates from a single sine - damped oscillation .",
    "it is better described by the sum of a sine - damped oscillation plus a non oscillating exponentially decaying term .",
    "the characteristic decay rate of this non oscillating term is rather insensitive to the laser intensity and remains comparable to the time - of - flight decay rate . for a quantitative analysis ,",
    "the observed temporal evolutions were ( least square ) fitted with the function @xmath37 in the case of the @xmath38 transients and with the function @xmath39 for the @xmath2 transients ( @xmath40 are adjustable parameters ) . since the @xmath2 transient for the eia type transition does not show any significant non oscillating term , in this case , coefficient @xmath41 was taken zero .",
    "the fitting functions closely adjust to the data ( the differences would be barely observable on the scale of figs .",

    "the corresponding eigenmode is , as expected , the dark state : @xmath131 .",
    "since the dark state is not coupled to the light , it s transient temporal evolution is unobservable .",
    "this is not longer the case for @xmath2 since then the dark state is not stationary and consequently the eigenmode corresponding to @xmath132 is contaminated with the bright state @xmath133 and thus coupled to the excited state . as a consequence",

    "it remains the leading eigenvalue even at large values of the driving field intensity .",
    "this , together with the fact that the oscillating mode decays at rate @xmath135 with @xmath136 ( see fig .",
    "[ eigeit]a ) explains the slow exponential component of the @xmath2 transient obtained for large optical field intensity in the eit type transition ( fig .",
    "[ simuleit ] ) .",
    "the dependence on driving field intensity of@xmath137 presents a minimum at intensity @xmath138 ( @xmath139 in fig .",
    "[ eigeit]a ) .",
    "below this critical value , the driving field intensity is responsible for the faster damping of the transient .",
    "above @xmath138 an increase in light intensity results in the slowing of the atomic evolution .",
    "the situation is rather different for the eia type transition @xmath140 ( fig . [",
    "eigeit]b ) . in this case",
    ", all observable decay modes correspond to eigenvalues whose real parts are ( in absolute value ) increasing functions of the driving field intensity . as a consequence",
    ", there is no exponential decay surviving significantly longer than the damped oscillation for @xmath2 .",
    "the simple model calculation presented above explains the main features of the experimental observations .",
    "this is somehow surprising in view of the several simplifications of the model with respect to the actual experimental conditions .",
    "a first simplification is the neglecting of the atomic motion .",
    "it is justified by the fact that the raman resonance condition between ground state zeeman sublevels is unaffected by the doppler effect .",
    "in addition , the model does not account for the effect of the optical intensity distribution in the beam profile and of the light propagation across the sample .",
    "the influence of the former effect is minimized in the experiments by only collecting light from the central ( uniform intensity ) portion of the light beam .",
    "no significant variation of the transients with the atomic density ( optical thickness ) of the sample was observed .",
    "we discuss now the role of the contribution of the different hyperfine transitions to the observed transients .",
    "the hyperfine structure of the ground level of rb is well separated in the absorption spectrum . however , due to the doppler broadening the excited state hyperfine structure is unresolved .",
    "consequently , for a given frequency position of the driving field coupled to one of the ground state hyperfine levels @xmath141 , the atomic response is due to three different transitions to excited state hyperfine levels @xmath142 .",
    "the contribution of each hyperfine transition on the total absorption signal is a function of the specific isotope and transition considered , the precise position of the optical frequency within the doppler absorption profile and the light intensity .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown that the total absorption presents eit type coherence resonances when the lower ground state hyperfine level is excited and eia type resonances for the case of the upper ground state hyperfine level @xcite . in the case of the lower ground state level , this is due to the fact that all three hyperfine transitions give rise to eit @xcite . in the case of the upper ground state",
    "hyperfine level , the atomic response is quantitatively dominated by the closed transition [ @xmath143 for @xmath10rb ] which corresponds to eia .",
    "however this is only true provided that the exciting laser is not too far detuned to the red side of the doppler absorption profile and that the rabi frequency remains small in comparison with the excited state hyperfine structure .",
    "in fact , significant distortions in the transients were observed for the eia type transition at maximum available light intensity ( not presented ) .",
    "finally let us remind that for simplicity we have theoretically analyzed the model eia  type transition @xmath140 .",
    "however , we have checked that qualitatively similar results are obtained for the transition @xmath144 occurring in @xmath10rb . the good agreement obtained between the observations and",
    "the prediction of the simplified model , where a single atomic transition is considered , suggests that the essential features of the atomic response are a direct consequence of the type of the dominant transition(s ) rather than the specific transition(s ) involved .",
    "the most intriguing result presented above is the unexpected an rather counterintuitive long transient observed for @xmath2 with driving field intensities near saturation for the eit type resonances .",
    "instead of being the cause of the rapid damping of the atomic evolution , the applied driving field is , in this case , responsible for slowing down the evolution .",
    "this is the consequence of the zeno effect@xcite in the sense recently discussed by luis@xcite . in this context",
    ", the optical field is seen as a continuous measurement projecting the state of the system onto the ds and thus preventing its evolution . also , increasing the driving field intensity results in an enhanced stability of the initial quantum state . following the analysis of luis , the present result can be seen as the preparation of a specific quantum state ( the ds in our case ) and its preservation via the zeno effect . indeed , a transient such as the one presented in fig .",
    "[ simuleit]e correspond to a slow non - oscillating evolution of the population in the ds . as fig .",
    "[ eigeit]a indicates , the survival time of the ds increases once the driving field intensity is above @xmath145 .",
    "although the quantum zeno effect is usually presented in terms of the projection postulate associated to measurement in quantum mechanics , such picture is not essential in our case where the whole dynamics is well reproduced by the bloch equation treatment@xcite .",
    "the preservation of trapping states in optical pumping experiments at large optical intensities was first reported in @xcite .",
    "more recently , a similar slowing down of the atomic evolution was discussed and observed by godun _",
    "_ @xcite .    from a similar perspective ,",
    "the rather different temporal evolution observed for hanle / eia resonances with @xmath2 , can be immediately explained by the non existence of a state uncoupled to the light field onto which the system could be projected .",
    "as a consequence , the observed and calculated decay rates are increasing functions of the optical intensity .",
    "the transient evolution of the atomic absorption of a linearly polarized optical field as the longitudinal magnetic field is suddenly switched on or off has been observed in rb vapor .",
    "different transients have been observed depending on the corresponding coherence ( hanle ) resonance being of the eit or eia type .",
    "the main features of the experimentally observed transients are well reproduced by a theoretical model based on the numerical integration of optical bloch equations where the zeeman degeneracy of the atomic levels is fully taken into account .",
    "as expected , for low driving field intensities all transient evolutions are governed by the time - of - flight relaxation rate .",
    "the falling into the ds or the eas ( @xmath35 transients ) occurring for eit and eiatype transitions respectively , happens with similar decay rates that are increasing functions of the driving field intensity .",
    "interesting differences arise between the @xmath2 transients corresponding to the departure from the ds or the eas for driving field intensities approaching saturation .",
