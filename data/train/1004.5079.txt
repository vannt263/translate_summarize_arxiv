    "the recent production of graphene  @xcite , the first truly one - atom thick material , enabled several unthoughtful experiments where charge carriers were undoubtedly shown to be massless with a linear dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "in addition to single layer graphene ( slg ) , few - layer graphene can also be isolated .",
    "of particular interest to us is the double layer graphene system , where two carbon layers are placed on top of each other according to the usual bernal @xmath0-stacking .",
    "the low - energy properties of this so - called bilayer graphene ( blg ) are then described by massive dirac fermions  @xcite , with a quadratic dispersion close to the neutrality point and a dirac fermion mass originating from the inter - plane hopping energy @xmath1 .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of blg is the ability to open a gap in the spectrum by electric field effect    biased blg .",
    "this has been realized experimentally , providing the first semiconductor whose gap can be tuned externally @xcite . in the absence of external perpendicular electric field ",
    "unbiased blg  the system is characterized by four bands , two of them touching each other at zero energy , and giving rise to the massive dirac fermions mentioned above , and other two separated by an energy @xmath2 .",
    "hence , an unbiased blg is a two - dimensional zero - gap semiconductor . at the neutrality",
    "point the conductivity shows a minimum of the order of the conductance quantum @xcite , a property shared with slg  @xcite .",
    "this prevents standard logic applications where the presence of a finite gap producing high on - off current ratios is of paramount importance .",
    "the fact that a simple perpendicular electric field is enough to open a gap , and even more remarkable , to control its value , clearly demonstrates the potential of this system for carbon - based electronics .",
    "a new plateau at zero hall conductivity @xcite and ferromagnetic behavior at low densities are some of the gap consequences @xcite .",
    "moreover , the induced gap has been shown to be robust to the presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "although such a tunable gap by the electric field effect is not possible in slg , band gaps can still be engineered by confining graphene electrons in narrow ribbons @xcite .",
    "however , the lateral confinement brings about the presence of edges , which in graphene can have profound consequences on electronics .",
    "this is essentially due to the rather different behavior of the two possible ( perfect ) terminations in graphene : _ zigzag _ and _ armchair_. while zigzag edges support localized states , armchair edges do not @xcite . these surface ( or edge ) states occur at zero energy , the same as the fermi level of undoped graphene , meaning that low energy properties may be substantially altered by their presence .",
    "the self - doping phenomenon @xcite and the edge magnetization with consequent gap opening @xcite are among edge states driven effects . in blg ,",
    "the question regarding the presence of edge states is also pertinent .",
    "firstly , zigzag edges are among the possible terminations in blg , and secondly , the presence of edges is unavoidable in tiny devices .",

    "we are interested in the properties of blg in the presence of a perpendicular electric field    the biased blg .",
    "the external perpendicular electric field gives rise to an electrostatic energy difference between the two layers , which we parametrize by @xmath21 per electron .",

    "thus , low - energy quasiparticles in blg are massive , with a light effective mass given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the bare electron mass @xcite .",
    "although this behavior is clearly different from the low - energy massless dirac fermions found in slg , @xmath39 , it has been shown that the effective 2-band model describing low - energy physics in blg is still a pseudo - spin hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "consequently , blg is also far from a standard two - dimensional electron gas ; the observed anomalous quantum hall effect is an example of such an unconventional behavior @xcite .",

    "so far we have considered @xmath21 as a band parameter that controls the gap .",

    "@xcite the devices have been chemically doped by deposition of ammonia ( nh@xmath68 ) on top of the upper layer , which adsorbed on graphene and effectively acted as a top gate providing a fixed electron density @xmath69 .",

    "this is an indication that screening due to correlation effects should be taken into account .      in deriving eqs .",
    "and   we assumed that the electric field @xmath57 in the blg region was exactly the external one , @xmath59 .",
    "there is , however , an obvious additional contribution : the external electric field polarizes the blg , inducing some charge asymmetry between the two graphene layers , which in turn give rise to an internal electric field , @xmath84 , that screens the external one .    to estimate @xmath84",
    "we can again apply a parallel plate capacitor model .",
    "the internal electric field due to the charge asymmetry between planes may thus be written as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the induced charge imbalance between layers , which can be estimated through the weight of the wave functions in each layer , @xmath87 where the factor 2 comes from spin degeneracy , @xmath88 is the number of unit cells and @xmath89 is the unit cell area , @xmath90 is a band label , and the prime sum runs over all occupied @xmath91 s .",
    "note that in order to calculate @xmath92 we must specify @xmath21 , as it determines the amplitudes on the right hand side of eq .  .",
