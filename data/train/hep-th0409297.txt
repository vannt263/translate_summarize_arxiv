    "if one wants to analyze the non - perturbative structure of gauge theories , one should start with clarifying basic structures like that of the field algebra , the observable algebra and the superselection structure of the hilbert space of physical states .",
    "it is clear that the standard doplicher - haag - roberts theory @xcite for models , which do not contain massless particles , does not apply here .",
    "nonetheless , there are interesting partial results within the framework of general quantum field theory both for quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and for non - abelian models , see @xcite .    to be rigorous",
    ", one can put the system on a finite lattice , leaving the ( extremely complicated task ) of constructing the full continuum limit , for the time being , aside .",
    "this way , one gets rid of complicated functional analytical problems , but the gauge theoretical problems one is interested in are still present within this setting . for basic notions concerning lattice gauge theories ( including fermions )",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "our approach is hamiltonian , thus , we put the model on a finite ( regular ) cubic lattice . in this context , we have formulated ( and in the meantime partially solved @xcite ) the following programme :    1 .",
    "describe the field algebra @xmath8 in terms of generators and defining relations and endow it with an appropriate functional analytical structure 2 .",
    "describe the observable algebra @xmath9 ( algebra of gauge invariant operators , fulfilling the gauss law ) in terms of generators and relations 3 .",
    "analyze the mathematical structure of @xmath9 and endow it with an appropriate functional analytical structure 4 .",
    "classify all irreducible representations of @xmath9 5 .",
    "investigate dynamics in terms of observables    finally , of course , one wants to construct the continuum limit .",
    "as already mentioned , in full generality , this is an extremely complicated problem of constructive field theory .",
    "however , the results obtained until now suggest that there is some hope to control the thermodynamical limit , see @xcite for a heuristic discussion .",
    "we also mention that for simple toy models , these problems can be solved , see @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we have started to investigate the structure of the field and the observable algebra of lattice qcd . in these papers we took the attitude of implementing the constraints on the quantum level .",
    "it is well known that there is another possibility : first , one reduces the classical phase space and then one formulates the quantum theory over this reduced phase space .",
    "since the action of the gauge group can have several orbit types , the first step has to be done using singular marsden - weinstein reduction @xcite .",
    "then the reduced phase space has the structure of a stratified symplectic space .",
    "quantization procedures for such spaces have been worked out recently or are still under investigation @xcite . as an important ingredient for both reduction and quantization , in this paper , we study the stratified structure of the reduced classical configuration space . for qcd on a finite lattice ,",
    "this is given by the orbit space of the action of @xmath10 on @xmath11 by inner automorphisms .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ basics ] we give a precise formulation of the problem and we discuss the basic tools used in this paper . in section [ stratification ] , the stratification of the reduced configuration space is characterized algebraically for arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "next , in section [ invariantsorbspace ] the full algebra of invariants is discussed for the cases @xmath6 and @xmath5 finally , in sections [ n=1 ] and [ n=2 ] the stratified structure is investigated for @xmath6 and @xmath12 in some detail , both in terms of invariants and relations and in more geometric terms . moreover , the strata are characterized explicitly using local cross sections .",
    "we consider qcd on a finite regular cubic lattice @xmath13 in the hamiltonian framework . in this context , the classical gluonic potential is approximated by its parallel transporter : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the set of @xmath17-dimensional elements ( links ) of @xmath18 thus , the classical configuration space @xmath19 over a given link @xmath20 is isomorphic to the group manifold @xmath1 and the classical phase space over @xmath20 is isomorphic to @xmath21 thus , the ( gluonic ) lattice configuration space is given by @xmath22 it is obviously isomorphic to the product @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting the number of lattice links .",
    "the corresponding phase space is a product of phase spaces of the above type .",
    "gauge transformations act on parallel transporters by @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 denoting the set of @xmath28-dimensional elements ( sites ) of @xmath29 these transformations induce transformations of the phase space over @xmath30 thus , the lattice gauge group is given by @xmath31 with every @xmath32 being a copy of @xmath33    the above symmetry can be easily reduced using the following technique : we choose a _ lattice tree _ , which consists of a fixed lattice point ( root ) @xmath34 and a subset of @xmath16 such that for every lattice site @xmath35 there is a unique lattice path from @xmath35 to @xmath36 now , we can fix the gauge on every on  tree link and we can parallel transport every off - tree configuration variable to the point @xmath34 .",
    "this can be viewed as a reduction with respect to the pointed lattice gauge group @xmath37 we end up with a partially reduced configuration space being isomorphic to @xmath38 , with @xmath3 denoting the number of off - tree links .",
    "the corresponding phase space is given by the cotangent bundle @xmath39 .",
    "the reduced gauge group is @xmath40 , acting via inner automorphisms @xmath41 : @xmath42    thus , we have a finite dimensional hamiltonian system with symmetry group @xmath1 . since this action has several orbit types , quantization turns out to be a complicated task . usually , the non - generic strata occuring here are omitted .",
    "if one wants to include them consistently , one has to develop a quantum theory over a stratified set .",
    "one option to do this is to perform quantization after reduction , i.e. , to quantize the reduced phase space of @xmath38 .",
    "this is a stratified symplectic space which is constructed from @xmath43 by singular marsden - weinstein reduction @xcite . by properly implementing the tree gauge on the level of the phase space , it can be shown that this space is isomorphic , as a stratified symplectic space , to the reduced phase space of the full lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "this completely justifies the use of the tree gauge in this approach .",
    "the reduced phase space of @xmath38 is a bundle over the reduced configuration space @xmath44 in this work , we investigate @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "moreover , the orbit of an element @xmath51 is diffeomorphic to @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath69 we have two additional relations induced from the two invariant tensors of @xmath70 , see @xcite , @xmath71 relations ( [ tr ",

    "but to find the range of @xmath59 , defined in terms of a number of _ inequalities _ between invariants , turns out to be a complicated problem . therefore , this will be discussed in a separate paper , see @xcite .",
