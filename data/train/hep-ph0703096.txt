    "theoretical predictions of elemental abundances are based on known physics such as the nuclear reactions of light elements , general relativity and the standard model ( sm ) of particles physics . if the observations of hydrogen , helium and lithium abundances in the present are capable of determining their primordial values , the consistency of the entire theoretical framework can be tested . in recent years",
    "these tests acquired particular sharpness , as the only free parameter , the ratio of baryons to photons , is now well - measured through the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .    perhaps the most exciting prospect of studying the primordial abundances is the possibility of testing the combination of standard model and general relativity , which we call sbbn , or standard bbn . to this end",
    "it is important to understand how the non - standard physics can affect the outcome of nuclear reactions ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "schematically , the bbn equations can be represented as @xmath7 in this formula , @xmath8 are the abundances of light elements , @xmath9 are the generalized ( positive or negative ) rates for creation or destruction of element @xmath10 with participation of @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the hubble expansion rate , @xmath13 is the planck constant , and @xmath14 is the number of effective degrees of freedom comprised of fermionic and bosonic fields .",
    "the radiation - domination expression for @xmath15 is used .",
    "there are several ways in which non - standard cosmological and/or particle physics can affect the freeze - out abundances @xmath16 of light elements . to date the following generic possibilities",
    "have been identified :    1 .   _",
    "timing _ of the reactions can be changed , for example by models that have additional contributions to @xmath12 ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such contributions may come from the additional thermally excited relativistic degrees of freedom ( historically often referred to as  extra neutrino \" species ) , or from any other forms of energy that contributes to the total energy density at a significant level , such as  tracker \" scalar fields @xcite .",
    "_ non - thermal components _ to nuclear reactions can be introduced by injection of energy during or after the bbn @xcite .",
    "for example , unstable or annihilating heavy particles can cause such injection , leading for example to the break - up of into d or , or to the synthesis of lithium via out - of - equilibrium processes involving energetic secondary projectiles .",
    "the most important parameters in these types of models are the amount of energy injected at @xmath17 lifetime , and the fraction of energy injected into hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "_ new catalyzed thermal channels _ @xmath18 can be opened up if the heavy particle physics remnants have the ability to bind to nuclei during the bbn .",
    "the consequences of the catalyzed bbn ( cbbn ) scenario with charged relics which are present at the time of the bbn , and the corresponding catalytic enhancement of  by several orders of magnitude , was explicitly demonstrated in the recent paper @xcite .",
    "the main parameters that determine the strength of catalysis are the initial number densities of such particles and their lifetimes .",
    "other notable modifications to the standard scenario include an impact from possible inhomogeneity of the universe at the time of bbn @xcite , and even more contrived options such as time dependent couplings @xcite .",
    "the latter again affects the bbn predictions mostly via changing the timing of such processes as the @xmath19 freeze - out and deuterium formation .    in this paper",
    "we assess the ability of cbbn to reduce the amount of primordial .",
    "this question has gained importance recently , as the amount of predicted by sbbn is about a factor of @xmath20 larger than the amounts of observed in the stellar atmospheres at low metallicities .",
    "this discrepancy is difficult to attribute to the nuclear rate uncertainties in the context of the standard scenario @xcite .",
    "it is entirely possible , however , that unaccounted depletion of in stars can be responsible for the overall depletion of primordial .",
    "we refer the reader to the recent discussion in astrophysical literature @xcite .",
    "regardless of whether the primordial lithium overabundance issue can be resolved by careful analysis of realistic stellar models , one should investigate the feasibility of other options for the reduction of primordial lithium , such as by new models of particle physics .",
    "it has been shown recently that the reduction of from a large energy release is possible if the metastable particles decay at around @xmath21 kev temperature ( @xmath22 sec ) and have a significant hadronic fraction in their decay products @xcite .",
    "another possibility based purely on the catalysis of thermal nuclear reactions was pointed out in @xcite , where a similar range of lifetimes has been suggested . besides ref .",
    "@xcite , the cosmological consequences from the bound states of nuclei with charged particles were considered in @xcite ( see also the discussion in the earlier work @xcite ) .",
    "the efficiency of the catalytic reduction of , or more precisely of + , depends crucially on the rate of the bound state formation , as more than @xmath23 of predicted lithium at @xmath24 comes in the form of .",
    "once is formed , a new set of reaction channels opens up @xcite , and this paper considers them in detail .",
    "these channels include an enhancement in @xmath25-destruction of , enhanced internal capture of and , as well as other channels .",
    "the bound state then serves as a  bottleneck \" for a potential solution to lithium problem in the cbbn framework .",
    "it is therefore very important to calculate the efficiency of the formation as accurately as possible , as the naive hydrogen - like formula employed in some studies may give a poor approximation to the correct answer . having determined the catalyzed nuclear rates , and the rate of the bound state formation , we solve the resulting bbn equations in the lithium chain numerically for some representative values of the parameter space and determine in which cases cbbn provides a noticeable reduction of + , while keeping within observational bounds .",
    "it is important to stress that we try to keep our investigation of cbbn processes as model independent as possible .",
    "the two main parameters that enter in the cbbn reactions are the lifetime and the initial abundance of the  particles , which we choose to normalize on the baryon number density , = y_x ( -t/_x)= y_x(-178s/(_xt_9 ^ 2 ) ) . in this formula , @xmath26 is the temperature in units of @xmath27 k , @xmath28 is the lifetime , and @xmath29 is the initial abundance at @xmath30 .",
    "besides the existence of @xmath31 parameter space , one has to recognize the existence of two generic classes of models that can affect the cbbn reactions .",
    "these are models of type i and type ii @xcite , which have different ways of achieving the longevity of . in type",
    "i models the long lifetime is due to the weakness of the couplings ( e.g. models with the gravitino as the lightest supersymmetric particle ) , while in type ii it is due to the small , @xmath32(mev ) , energy release in the transition between  and   while the couplings are assumed to be of normal size .",
    "type i models are necessarily accompanied by large energy release , and thus possible impact on bbn can be twofold : due to the catalysis of thermal nuclear reactions and due to non - thermal processes . in this paper",
    "we do not treat non - thermal effects , as they tend to be very model - specific .",
    "the properties of the bound states of and are very important because they are essential for determining the temperature and probability of recombination . using the gaussian charge distribution within the nucleus ,",
    "we determine the following energy of the ground state relative to +  continuum : @xmath33 in this formula , the first line is a naive bohr - like formula for a point - like nucleus , which , of course , gets a significant correction from the realistic values of the charge radius .",
    "these values can be derived from experimentally measured values for the nucleon radius of @xcite . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we adopt the central value from the second line of ( [ eb ] ) .",
    "we have checked that both the variational calculation and the numerical solution to the schrdinger equation produce identical answers .",

    "the internal structure of the nucleus must also be taken into account .",
    "in particular , the first excited state of beryllium is close to the ground state and can not be neglected ,    angular momentum @xmath34 ( as opposed to the ground state with @xmath35 ) can also bind to .",
    "some of these metastable bound states have total energies just above the + continuum threshold .",
    "this opens the possibility of a resonant transition into a bound state , and therefore such states have to be taken into account separately .",
    "the three most important bound states identified in this way belong to the principal quantum number @xmath36 @xmath37 in these formulae , @xmath38 is the energy level of the state relative to the @xmath39 + continuum .",
    "it is also of interest to quote the position of @xmath40 resonances : @xmath41 unlike the hydrogen - like case , the @xmath42 are not exactly degenerate , which allows for a significant one - photon @xmath43 transition between them , @xmath44 , and is quite comparable to the electromagnetic widths of @xmath36 states .",
    "one can also notice that the @xmath45 state is very close to the threshold , which is potentially very important for the calculation of the capture rate . moreover , there are number of additional effects that may lead to a few tens of kev upward shift of this level .",
    "such effects include the correction for the finite mass of @xmath1 , a perhaps larger charge radius of the excited state , and correction for nuclear polarizability .",
    "the precision in our calculations is certainly limited , and only the dedicated many - body nuclear studies can reach better than @xmath46 determination of the energy levels . we therefore conclude that the @xmath45 state may be indeed at the threshold or just above @xmath47 .",
    "the process of recombination between and may seem to be relatively simple to calculate .",
    "for the continuum spectrum wave functions we can use the approximation of @xmath48 to good accuracy , as the characteristic energies are on the order of the temperature , which is significantly smaller than the binding energy , @xmath49 .",
    "we find these wave functions by solving the corresponding schrdinger equation numerically .",
    "the process of recombination can occur via two mechanisms involving resonant and non - resonant capture .",
    "the non - resonant recombination is given by the processes [ nonres ] _ 3/2+x^-(_3/2x^-,n1)+(x^-)+k , + _",
    "3/2+x^-(_1/2x^-,n=1,2)+(x^-)+k , where @xmath50 is a typical number of emitted photons ranging from 1 to 3 . among the non - resonant processes the capture of @xmath51 directly to the ground state",
    "has the largest cross section , closely followed by the capture to @xmath52 level .",
    "the cross section of photorecombination differs very significantly from the  hydrogen - like \" formula .",
    "in fact , it is about one order of magnitude smaller than the naive formula , with most of the suppression coming from the @xmath53 factor , which is a factor of @xmath548 smaller in the realistic case ( [ eb ] ) .",
    "the resonant capture occurs through the following chain of transitions : [ res ]",
    "_ 3/2+x^-(_1/2x^-,n3 ) ( _ 1/2x^-,n=1)+k(x^-)+(k+1 ) , to estimate the cross section in this case , one has to find the widths of the corresponding metastable states .",
    "it turns out that the entrance width of the process @xmath55 is due to a quadrupole nuclear transition in the electric field of .",
    "if the distance @xmath56 between  particle and  is large , the interaction takes the form of @xmath57 . using the existing experimental information on the quadrupole matrix elements in  system , we estimate matrix elements of this interaction between the initial wave function of the free @xmath39 , and the intermediate wave function of the @xmath58 bound states of @xmath59 , to conclude that @xmath60 is comparable to 1 kev .",
    "given that the electromagnetic decay widths of @xmath58 states , whose calculations are much easier , are all on the order of @xmath61 ev , we arrive at the following hierarchy of the `` in '' , `` out '' widths and the temperature , _ ^out _ q^int .",
    "this warrants the narrow resonance approximation in the breit - wigner formula , and we use _",

    "notice that in this approximation the rather uncertain value of @xmath64 does not enter into the formula for the cross section .    after performing several quite tedious but straightforward calculations ,",

    "the first term in ( [ sigma_tot ] ) corresponds to the non - resonant processes of ( [ nonres ] ) , while the second and third terms are the resonant pieces with internal excitations of and initial capture on @xmath68 and @xmath69 levels .",
    "the relative size of the two effects can be seen in figure [ f2_mod ] , where the total recombination cross section , and the non - resonant piece are plotted separately .",
    "one can see that the resonant effects from @xmath58 levels may provide a sizable ( up to 50% ) contribution in the most important domain of temperatures , @xmath70 .",
    "so far the possible contribution of @xmath40 states has been ignored .",
    "there is , however , an ample chance of @xmath45 state giving a large contribution to the recombination cross section via the following chain , [ res2s ]",

    "as was argued in the previous subsection , only a dedicated nuclear calculation can exactly determine the position of this resonance , which consequently bring a sizable nuclear uncertainty into the calculation of recombination cross section . in what follows",
    "we assume two extreme situations .",
