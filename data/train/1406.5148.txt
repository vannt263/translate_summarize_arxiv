    "the thermoelectric and thermomagnetic phenomena discovered in the 19th century turned out unexpectedly to be in the spotlight at the beginning of the 21st century .",
    "first of all , from a practical point of view , control of the heat fluxes and minimization of the related losses are important factors for designing modern elements of nanoelecronics . at the same time",

    "were observed wei2009prl , zuev2009prl , checkelsky2009prb , wang2011prb , which are huge compared to the nonmagnetic metals .",
    "these measurements provided unique information on the details of the electronic structure of the ambipolar nature of graphene , and they correspond with the electrical transport studies .",
    "moreover , seebeck and ne effects can be further enhanced and controlled by opening a gap in the quasiparticle spectrum of the dirac materials @xcite .    in this context , the synthesis of silicene @xcite , a monolayer of silicon atoms forming a two - dimensional low - buckled lattice , boosted theoretical studies of a wide class of new dirac materials .",
    "the honeycomb lattice of silicene can be described as in graphene in terms of two triangular sublattices . however , a larger ionic size of silicon atoms results in buckling of the 2d lattice .",
    "accordingly , the sites on the two sublattices are vertically separated at a distance @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , silicene is expected cahangirov2009prl , drummond2012prb , liu2011prl , liu2011prb to have a strong intrinsic spin - orbit interaction that results in a sizable spin - orbit gap , @xmath9 , in the quasiparticle spectrum opened at the dirac points .",
    "moreover , by applying the electric field @xmath10 perpendicular to the plane , it is possible to create the on - site potential difference between the two sublattices opening the additional gap , @xmath11 , in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "similar structure and properties are also expected in 2d sheets of ge , sn , p and pb atoms @xcite ( the first three materials are coined as germanene , stanene and phosphorene ) .    due to nonzero spin - orbit gap @xmath9 the quantum spin hall ( qsh )",
    "effect @xcite becomes experimentally accessible in silicene .",
    "the latter is fundamentally related to the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "the analogy between thermomagnetic phenomena in graphene and spintronics of the low - buckled dirac materials shows that the latter should also be very promising for the investigation of the spin caloritronics phenomena @xcite . among these",
    ", there is a particular interest in the off - diagonal spin nernst ( sn ) effect , an analogue of the ne effect in a normal conductor subjected to a magnetic field .",
    "it is the spin - orbit gap @xmath9 that plays the role of an effective magnetic field that generates the sn effect even in the absence of a real magnetic field in the new dirac materials . in this paper",
    ", we will show that due to the large value of @xmath12 the off - diagonal thermospin coefficient , @xmath13 , is indeed expected to be huge in these materials while at the same time being nontrivially dependent on the chemical potential @xmath6 and electric field @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "sec : models ] the model describing silicene and the basic model of the gapped two - component dirac fermions .",

    "here we neglected the small rashba interaction @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian - density ] ) , describes four kinds ( two identical pairs ) of the noninteracting massive ( gapped ) dirac quasiparticles with the masses @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the fermi velocity , @xmath26 is the spin , and the valley - dependent gap @xmath27    the qsh effect in silicene occurs due to the presence of two subsystems with @xmath28 each exhibiting the quantum hall effect .",
    "the corresponding chiral edge states are spin - polarized and form a time - reversed pair to recover the overall time - reversal symmetry ( the kane - mele scenario @xcite ) .",
    "the spin hall conductivity can be expressed sinitsyn2006prl , dyrdal2012pss in terms of the electric hall conductivity @xmath29 for the two - component dirac fermions with the gap @xmath30 ( see the hamiltonian ( [ dirac - hamiltonian ] ) below ) by the relation @xmath31 the factor @xmath32 indicates that in the off - diagonal correlation function of the two electric currents , one electric current is replaced by the spin current .",
    "being subjected to the temperature gradient @xmath33 , the spin - polarized chiral edge states loose their time - reversal symmetry and the spin current @xmath34 flows .",
    "the latter is related to @xmath33 by means of the thermospin tensor , @xmath35 , via @xcite @xmath36 .",
    "analogously to the spin hall conductivity , the off - diagonal component @xmath37 can be obtained from ( [ hall2spin - hall ] ) by the substitution @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the standard thermoelectric coefficient for the two - component dirac fermions .",
    "thus in the absence of valley mixing , the study of the spin transport coefficient is reduced to an investigation of the electric transport for the two - component gapped dirac fermions .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian density is @xmath41this model with broken time - reversal symmetry provides a simple realization of the anomalous hall and thermoelectric effects .",
    "its main merit is the possibility of obtaining simple approximate analytical expressions in the presence of spin - independent random potential with gaussian correlations @xcite . the two - component fermion model ( [ dirac - hamiltonian ] ) is considered in secs .  [ sec : qualitative ] , [ sec : kubo - modified ] and [ sec : magnetization ] .",
    "a qualitative evaluation of the thermoelectric coefficient @xmath42 can be obtained basing on the mott relation , @xmath43where @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant . in the clean limit at @xmath45 one",
    "finds @xcite @xmath46 , we obtain that @xmath47 .",

    "the main feature of the dirac materials is that the value of the chemical potential @xmath6 can be tuned as close as possible to the regime with @xmath53 .",
    "this is exactly how one gains from 3 to 4 orders of magnitude in the nernst signal as compared to the normal nonmagnetic metals , where @xmath54 is negligibly small ( @xmath55 per tesla)._ii _ ) our simple estimate also shows that mott s formula fails near @xmath56 when the conductivity @xmath57 changes abruptly . indeed , as discussed recently in @xcite ( see also references therein ) , when the gap is present in the quasiparticle spectrum , one should use the microscopic approach .",
    "the same is true for the sn effect : as of yet it has been studied mostly using a formula analogous to mott s formula written for the spin conductivity @xcite ( see also the numerical study @xcite based on the landauer - buttiker formula ) .",
    "the study of the off - diagonal thermal transport in the framework of the kubo formalism is a delicate issue .",
    "it was firstly understood 50 years ago by obraztsov @xcite that , in conjunction with the kubo - like response on the temperature gradient , magnetization currents must be taken into account in order to satisfy the onsager principle of the symmetry of the kinetic coefficients .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that this problem has been readdressed in almost every decade streda1977jpc , jonson1984prb , oji1985prb , cooper1997prb , xiao2006prl due to its importance for the quantum hall effect , ne in fluctuating superconductors , etc . in the problem under consideration",
    "the account for magnetization currents turns out to be crucial not only in order to get the correct coefficient in @xmath15 for the two - component gapped dirac fermions , but first and foremost for the validity of the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "we will show below , that the mere calculation of @xmath58 ( here @xmath59 is the retarded response function of electric and heat currents ) in the kubo formalism results in the expression that in the low - temperature limit is presented in the form of the laurent series : @xmath60 . at the same time",
    ", it is clear that at zero temperature the thermoelectric tensor must become zero : it describes the transport of entropy , which , in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics , becomes zero when @xmath61 . in the presence of an effective magnetic field",
