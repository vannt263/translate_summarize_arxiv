    "structural and kinematic properties of several astrophysical systems have been found to be correlated to the global properties of the system .",
    "for example , over a sample of thousands of galaxies , a correlation has been found between the lopsidedness , black hole ( bh ) growth , and the presence of young stellar populations in the center of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of these disc - like systems is an important field of investigation .    in this work",
    "we will mainly address discs around massive central objects where the self - gravity of the disc is sufficiently weak to make the disc nearly keplerian .",
    "such discs can support eigenmodes that are slow in comparison to the keplerian flow .",
    "the discs could be gaseous , or particulate and thus collisionless .",

    ", they could mimic the behaviour of collisionless discs .",
    "a major limitation of this method is that the fluid discs do not support slow modes for azimuthal wavenumber number @xmath6 .",
    "real collisionless discs , however , can support modes with all values of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "softened gravity discs have also been studied by @xcite , but with subtle differences in method , as discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "a general eigenvalue formulation exists for fluid discs , even without assuming the slow mode approximation @xcite , although this formulation assumes the tight - winding approximation to make the gravitational potential due to the disc perturbations local .",
    "recently , simulations involving linear perturbations in nearly keplerian collisionless discs have been performed by @xcite using the finite element method .",
    "however , apart from the disc stability analysis , which gives useful but limited analytical treatment of collisionless discs . in literature there does not exist an eigenvalue formulation for collisionless discs in the wkb approximation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose an _ eigenvalue formulation of linear perturbations in a collisionless disc _ based on the assumptions :    1 .",
    "radial wavenumber @xmath8 times the radius @xmath9 is much larger than the azimuthal wavenumber @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   the epicyclic approximation ,",
    "in which the velocity dispersion @xmath11 is much less than the circular speed @xmath12 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath13    the wkb or the tightly - wound spiral approximation requires @xmath10 , although , in many cases the approximation works fairly well even for @xmath14 as small as unity @xcite .",
    "the gravitational potential for a tightly - wound spiral is local , that is , it can be obtained from the local perturbed density @xcite . however , in our formulation we do not require this assumption , since we use the logarithmic - spiral decomposition of both the perturbed surface density and the gravitational potential @xcite for solving the poisson s equation .",
    "this allows the potential to take contributions from perturbations across the disc .",
    "the integral equation is derived without restricting ourselves to keplerian discs , and could be used to explore eigenmodes of non - keplerian discs such as galactic disc .",
    "however , to explore the validity of our formulation , for this work we restrict ourselves to nearly keplerian discs and further approximate the integral equation to the slow mode case to make comparisons with the results of @xcite . as a further test case we also consider perturbations in a kuzmin disc .    in   [ unprtbd_disc ]",
    "we describe the unperturbed disc . the integral equation is derived in   [ int_eqn ] .",
    "we show in the appendix  [ wkbreduction ] that the integral equation reduces to the standard wkb dispersion relation under the local approximation .",

    "  [ num_sol ] gives an account of solutions obtained for two surface density profiles ( 1 ) jt annular disc , the disc considered in @xcite ( 2 ) kuzmin disc .",
    "we conclude with general remarks in   [ cnclsn ] .",
    "dynamics of disc around a massive compact object , like discs of stars orbiting the super - massive bh found at the center of most galaxies , debris discs etc , are governed by the gravitational potential of the central mass and the self gravity of the disc . in such situations usually",
    "the ratio of disc mass @xmath15 to central mass @xmath16 ( i.e. @xmath17 ) is much smaller than unity .",

    "although our formulation is applicable to all stellar discs , for this work we have used it only to analyse the slow modes of a nearly keplerian disc .",

    "since the slow modes are stable , the excitation mechanism for such modes is important ; for example , a close encounter with a passing , massive object can act as an external perturbation that can excite these modes .",
    "@xcite have considered such a phenomenon in detail and conclude that external perturbation is an excellent mechanism to excite the slow modes .",
    "slow modes exists with arbitrary azimuthal wavenumber @xmath7 but the modes with lower @xmath7 values are large scale and hence are most prominent in the observations . also lower @xmath7 modes are easy to excite , for example by an external perturber @xcite .",
    "as noted by @xcite , galactic discs surrounding a suppermassive bh and debris disc around stars are similar in the sense that dynamics of both the discs are influenced by the central object ( star / suppermassive bh ) and the self - gravity of the disc .",

    "@xcite proposed that most of the non - axisymmetric features in the debris disc may be due to slow modes .",
    "there are other hypothesis like a presence of massive planet in debris discs , which can also cause these asymmetries in the discs .",
    "these can be distinguished from slow modes if the structures are observed for long enough time or with higher resolutions .",
    "features due to slow modes will rotate much slower as compared to the angular speed of the disc whereas structures due to planets in the discs will rotate at a speed comparable to the angular speed .",
