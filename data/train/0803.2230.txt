    "glasses seem to have a sizable excess of vibrations at this boson peak . at present",
    ", there is no agreement which forces drive these extra vibrations into the low - frequency region , though several possible explanations have been proposed @xcite .",
    "another controversial question @xcite is whether the interaction with these vibrations is the physical reason for the ioffe - regel limit , the reduction of the mean free path down to the wavelength of sound waves in the thz range .",
    "the present paper proposes a detailed atomic model for the boson peak modes in glasses consisting of close - packed atoms or spherical molecules : the soft modes are ascribed to small regions with a pronounced shear misfit with respect to the surrounding matrix . in the following section",

    ", the lowest - energy structural rearrangement can be viewed as a gliding of a triangle of three close - packed atoms over an underlying close - packed plane ( fig .",
    "1 ) . on the left side of fig .",
    "1 , the center of the upper triangle lies exactly over the center of a lower triangle within the close - packed plane .",
    "the central points of the six atoms form an octahedron . gliding the triangle into the vertical direction in fig . 1",
    ", one reaches again a stable position after a distance of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 sphere radius ) , the situation at the right side of fig .",
    "1 . the six atoms there form a pair of edge - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "since the distance between close - packed planes is @xmath2 , the shear angle is @xmath3 in radian , an angle of 40.5 degrees .",
    "the physical problem of a small piece of matter able to transform to a sheared shape within an elastic matrix has been treated fifty years ago by several authors , notably by j. d. eshelby @xcite . here , we translate eshelby s result into the usual convention , in which the shear angle @xmath4 and the shear stress @xmath5 are related by @xmath6 ( @xmath7 infinite frequency shear modulus ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be the volume of the spherical inclusion and @xmath9 the shear angle difference between its two stable configurations ( in the example of fig . 1 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the atomic volume ) . for strictly harmonic potentials ,",
    "the symmetric case of two equally strained configurations has the energy @xmath13 the coefficient @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is poisson s ratio .",
    "since poisson s ratio lies between 0.1 and 0.44 for the known glasses , @xmath14 lies between 0.48 and 0.57 , close to 1/2 .",
    "eshelby s solution divides the energy into two almost equal parts , one located in the inclusion and one outside .",
    "their ratio is @xmath17 . in the symmetric case",
    ", the inclusion would have to distort by @xmath18 to fit exactly into the unstrained hole in the surrounding matrix . from a structural point of view , this is the saddle point between the two stable configurations .    in strictly harmonic approximation , eq .",
    "( [ ea ] ) holds and the structural saddle point indeed is a saddle point of the energy landscape .",
    "however , the harmonic approximation does not account for the flattening at the saddle point , at least as regards the distortion energy @xmath19 of the inclusion . for the inclusion ,",
    "a better description is by a cosine law @xmath20 shown in fig .",
    "2 , where @xmath21 is the shear angle of the central inclusion , counted from the saddle point of the energy of the inclusion . this cosine law has the correct second derivative of @xmath22 at @xmath23 , the two structural energy minima of fig . 1 .",
    "the embedding energy outside the inclusion depends on the difference between @xmath21 and the zero point @xmath24 of the shear of the matrix . in terms of @xmath21 , the shear state of the hole after removing the inclusion and relaxing",

    "the debye wave vector is @xmath71 , so on average @xmath72 this shows that the gliding - triangle mode considered here has a maximum frequency of less than half the debye frequency in the absence of any structural strain .      in order to estimate the density of soft shear modes ,",
    "one first needs the number of octahedra per atom in the disordered structure . in the crystalline close - packed structures , both fcc and hcp , one has one octahedron per atom .",
    "though this number might easily be smaller in the disordered case , we will take it there also as one .    for each octahedron , there are twelve possibilities to distort to a pair of edge - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "there are four choices of the two triangles which are to glide against each other and for each pair there are three glide directions , @xmath73 rotated to each other . consequently , there are two stable minima per atom , the octahedron and the edge - sharing pair of tetrahedra , and twelve saddle points between them .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the twelve saddle points lie pairwise rather close to each other , with an angle of only 38.9 degrees between the two members of each pair .    at the glass temperature @xmath34 , the saddle points are already sufficiently high in energy to be , in first order , negligible for the partition function , which can be approximated by a harmonic potential around the octahedron energy minimum at @xmath74 .",

    "since we are only interested in the density of states well below @xmath88 , we neglect the square root term .",
    "then @xmath89 is simply constant @xmath90 this constant is to be compared with the constant @xmath91 , obtained by dividing the debye density of states by @xmath92 . for the average @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , one finds with eqs .",
    "( [ omd ] ) and ( [ ps ] ) a ratio of 0.6 between the density of the soft shear modes and the debye one .",
    "thus one has a rather large number of soft gliding triangle modes at low frequency , comparable with the number of sound waves .      the soft shear modes are not exact eigenmodes of the harmonic vibrations of the glass .",
    "they interact with the other vibrations and in particular with the sound waves .",
    "the low frequency shear modes can be understood as the cores of quasi - localized or resonant vibrations .",
    "they are bilinearly coupled to the other modes .",
    "this system of localized soft vibrations coupled bilinearly to extended modes ( sound waves ) is the basis of the soft potential model @xcite .    through their interaction with the sound waves ,",
    "there is also an interaction between the soft shear modes .",
    "the bilinear interaction of the soft modes with the much larger number of higher frequency modes causes a downshift of the soft modes , some of which even become harmonically unstable .",
    "stabilization via anharmonicity results in a soft mode spectrum linear in @xmath93 below a frequency @xmath94 given by the interaction strength , while at low frequency one has a dos @xmath95 .",
    "the crossover between the @xmath96 and @xmath93 regions then leads to the boson peak.@xcite the total number of soft modes is not changed by these frequency shifts .",
    "it has been shown that this interaction mechanism can explain the nearly universal density of observed two level systems in glasses.@xcite    for the purpose of the present paper , it suffices to know that the exact shape of the boson peak requires a more detailed theoretical treatment . here ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the conclusions which are easily accessible from our postulate for the eigenvector of the excess modes . as will be seen in the next subsection ,",
    "these conclusions include a calculation of the damping and softening of the sound waves from the measured spectrum of a given metallic glass .",
    "the coupling of a gliding - triangle soft shear mode to an external shear strain is given by the derivative of the elastic energy of eq .",

    "it is usual to express the coupling in terms of a product @xmath98 of the shear strain and the soft mode coordinate @xmath57 , defined via eq .",
    "( [ normal ] ) . from @xmath99",

    "( the full width at half maximum in a brillouin experiment ) is given by @xmath104 so the treatment predicts a damping of the transverse sound which increases with the frequency or wavevector squared . the ioffe - regel condition @xmath105 is reached at the frequency @xmath106 @xmath107 here @xmath108 is the ratio between debye density of states and soft shear wave density of states , which in the average metallic glass should be close to 1 . for the average case with @xmath36 , @xmath106 lies at 0.23 @xmath64 .",
    "the ioffe - regel limit for the longitudinal sound waves lies markedly higher , because the gliding - triangle modes couple only to the shear ( or essentially so ; we come back to this point in the discussion ) .",

    "the influence of the soft shear modes on the shear modulus is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the difference between @xmath7 above and below the boson peak .",
    "the best candidate for a check of these ideas is the metallic glass vit-4 , zr@xmath120ti@xmath121cu@xmath122ni@xmath123be@xmath124 , a glass with an exceptionally low critical cooling rate @xcite , for which every relevant quantity has been measured @xcite , though the mechanical @xcite , density @xcite and neutron @xcite data were all taken for slightly different compositions . at the glass temperature",
    "@xmath125 k , the shear modulus is 35 gpa , the bulk modulus 112 gpa @xcite and the atomic volume is 0.017 nm@xmath126 , so @xmath127 mev . fig .",
    "4 shows the boson peak at room temperature determined from inelastic neutron scattering data @xcite in units of the debye density of states ( at room temperature @xcite , @xmath128 mev ) .",
    "if one takes the excess over the debye density of states as gliding - triangle modes , one can calculate the corresponding damping of the sound waves .",
    "one finds that the ioffe - regel limit is never reached , even for the transverse sound waves . at the boson peak ,",
    "the damping is about half the ioffe - regel limit .",
    "since the longitudinal waves are even less damped , one expects rather sharp longitudinal brillouin peaks in an inelastic x - ray experiment .",
    "this was in fact measured for another metallic glass @xcite , ni@xmath129zr@xmath130 . in this case , one finds a @xmath131 dependence above @xmath62 , which probably has nothing to do with the boson peak .    though the boson peak is small , it is crucial for the mechanical properties and their temperature dependence in the undercooled liquid .",
    "one calculates @xmath132 from eq .",
    "( [ deltag ] ) with the excess modes from fig .",
    "4 . this fits in with the measured difference @xcite of 26 % of the shear moduli of glass and crystal .",
    "the shear modulus grneisen parameter @xmath133 is found to be 6.5 from the temperature dependence of @xmath7 @xcite and the density @xcite in the glass phase .",
    "consequently , the density ratio 1.027 between crystal and glass explains two thirds of the shear modulus difference , the gliding - triangle modes explain the rest .    in the undercooled liquid , the number of gliding - triangle modes increases exponentially according to eq .",

    "this is almost exactly found in experiment @xcite ( see fig .",
    "the reduction in the liquid is a factor of 2.4 larger than the grneisen expectation on the basis of the thermal expansion @xcite .",
    "the difference can be frozen into the glassy state by quenching .",
    "it is obviously due to configurational changes of the melt .",
    "the finding is of great importance for the understanding of liquids .",
    "our model gives a quantitative physical explanation for it : it is due to shear instabilities , stabilized by the surrounding matrix and requiring a formation energy of about three times @xmath135 , which reduce the shear modulus .",
    "the experiment @xcite reveals also an additional decrease of the bulk modulus with increasing temperature , though not quite as pronounced as the one of the shear modulus .",
    "if this is also attributed to our shear defects , they must couple to the compression . from the data @xcite ,",
    "the coupling constant ratio @xmath136 of these defects should be 1.69 rather than the value @xmath137 for a pure shear defect , close to the value 1.6 found for the tunneling states in glasses @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this point in the next section .",
    "the gliding - triangle model makes some rather detailed predictions for the low temperature glass anomalies @xcite .",
    "the easiest way to do this part of the comparison to experiment is to look at the relation between the picture given here and the soft potential model , the standard model in the field for which an extensive comparison with experimental data already exists @xcite .    the soft potential model @xcite connects the boson peak modes to the tunneling states @xcite and to low - barrier relaxation .",

    "it combines a very high energy , @xmath35 , coming from the fourth order potential term , with the very low kinetic confinement energy @xmath151 . in this context , it is interesting to note that the fourth order term of the quartic potential in fig .",
    "2 does not result from the short range atomic repulsion , but rather from the decrease of the curvature of the inclusion energy with increasing @xmath21 , an anharmonic property of the saddle point of the inclusion energy .",
    "let us next turn to the tunneling states .",
    "of course , the potential of eq .",
    "( [ etot ] ) is in no case a double - well potential with a low barrier able to form a tunneling state , because the negative force constant of the inclusion can at most cancel the positive force constant of the surrounding matrix . in terms of the soft - potential model ,",
    "the treatment in section ii corresponds to the case where the density @xmath152 is not constant around zero , but rather a @xmath153-function at zero ( this explains why one gets an @xmath92-rise in the excess density of states rather than the @xmath96-rise of the soft potential model ) .",
    "but it was already pointed out in section ii that the interaction between the quasilocalized modes is responsible for the shape of the boson peak and the appearance of tunneling states @xcite .",

    "here we have for the first time a detailed answer to this question , at least for an important subgroup of glasses .",
    "the coupling to longitudinal sound waves is described by the analogous coupling constant @xmath159 . from the consideration at the end of section ii on a pure shear defect like the one proposed here",
    ", one would expect a ratio @xmath160 .",
    "this does not agree with the experimental finding @xcite @xmath161 .",
    "as pointed out in the previous subsection , the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli in the vit-4 melt @xcite suggests a factor of 1.69 , so metallic glasses in this respect do not differ from the general case . at present , we see no obvious reason for this additional coupling to the compression .",
    "as seen in section iii , the ioffe - regel limit for longitudinal sound waves for metallic glasses should be by a factor of two to four higher than the one for transverse sound waves .",
    "in fact , an inelastic x - ray brillouin experiment in a metallic glass reveals a relatively low longitudinal sound wave damping @xcite .",
    "however , the metallic glass result @xcite is an exception rather than the rule @xcite . in the nonmetallic glasses ,",
    "one usually does find the ioffe - regel limit close to the boson peak , maybe slightly above the boson peak .",
    "how is this possible ?    the question is related to three ratios : the ratio of the boson peak height to the debye level , the ratio of the coupling constants @xmath162 , which for a pure shear defect is @xmath163 , and the ratio @xmath164 .",
    "as it turns out @xcite , this last ratio is about 5.1 in the metallic glasses , unusually high ( compare silica , where this ratio is 2.3 ) .",
    "this and the weakness of the boson peak in many metallic glasses are the two reasons for the weak longitudinal damping . a simulation @xcite in a soft sphere glass , where the ratio @xmath164 was even higher than for real metallic glasses , showed a very weak damping of the longitudinal waves .    there seems to be some as yet unexplained coupling of the boson peak modes to the compression .",
    "as pointed out in section iii , the ratio @xmath162 seems to be @xmath165 rather than @xmath163 .",
    "this feature is missing in our model .",
    "if one ascribes it to different packing factors for octahedron and tetrahedra pair , these should differ by about 18 % .",
    "this explanation seems not to be very convincing .",
    "we rather think that the absence of the compression coupling in our model comes from the neglect of the atomic roughness of the shell surrounding the six central atoms , which introduces a random coupling to the compression .    despite this small uncertainty",
    ", the evidence for the validity of the gliding triangle model in section iii shows that it is able to compete with other explanations of the boson peak @xcite .",
    "there is no adaptable parameter ; one only needs the shear modulus , the atomic mass and the atomic volume .",
    "the picture provides a microscopic basis for the empirical soft - potential model @xcite , not for all glasses , but for the subgroup of metallic glasses .",
    "the question is : to which extent is this answer universal ?",
    "how should one generalize it to other glasses , glasses with covalent bonds forming a random network , molecular glasses with the additional degree of freedom of the molecular rotation , to the random chain structure of polymers ?",
    "the answer to the question requires further studies .",
    "it might be an intelligent guess , however , to assume the following two general features :    \\(i ) the boson peak and the tunneling modes are always of the same nature , as postulated by the soft potential model    \\(ii ) boson peak modes and tunneling modes are due to small regions with a strong elastic shear misfit , lying close to a saddle point of the inclusion energy between two stable structural minima of the inclusion .",
    "the validity of these two assumptions would explain the universality of the low temperature anomalies in glasses , including those at slightly higher temperatures where the boson peak modes dominate .",

    "as it turns out , this special shear is a common feature of four of the twelve saddle point distortions , each coming from a different triangle plane . they only differ in the nondiagonal elements , the one from the @xmath192-plane having @xmath193 , @xmath185 and @xmath194 , the one from the @xmath195-plane having @xmath184 , @xmath196 and @xmath194 and finally the one from the @xmath197-plane having @xmath193 , @xmath196 and @xmath186 .",
    "this last one is closest to the first one , because the shear occurs in the same shear plane , with only a slight rotation of the shear directions . in the five - dimensional shear space ,",
    "the lines connecting those two saddle points with the octahedron have an angle of only 38.9 degrees ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "the closeness has consequences for the probability density @xmath198 of section ii .",
    "this was calculated integrating the partition function @xmath199 only over the connection line between octahedron and saddle point , and then multiplying with the number of saddle points . in principle , one needs the full integration over the five - dimensional shear space . as long as the saddle points are well separated in phase space , the integration over the irrelevant degrees of freedom can be omitted @xcite .",
    "but if two saddle points are as close together as in fig .",
    "7 , the integration over their neighborhood ( along the dashed lines in fig .",
    "7 ) leads to double - counting . in a crude approximation",
    ", we counted the four saddle points with the common diagonal shear elements as only two in eq .",
