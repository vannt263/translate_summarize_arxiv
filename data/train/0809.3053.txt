    "grover s quantum search algorithm [ 1 ] has been considered to be an efficient amplitude - amplification process for quantum states by exploiting the parallelism of quantum mechanics . as a remarkable idea in quantum computation",
    ", grover search algorithm could effectively exemplifies the potential speed - up offered by quantum computers .",
    "recently , many proposals have focused on the search algorithm by the adiabatic evolution method [ 2 - 4 ] or  by nonadiabatic scenario [ 5 ] .",
    "although achievement of these schemes needs stringent conditions and demanding techniques [ 6 ] , they are really wonderful ideas . on the other hand , some authors had addressed the effect of decoherence [ 7 ] , gate imperfection or errors [ 8 ] , and noise [ 9 ] on the efficiency of quantum algorithms .",
    "we also noticed that , there had been intensive interests in achieving grover search algorithm theoretically and experimentally by using nmr systems [ 10 ] , linear optical elements [ 11,12 ] , trapped ions [ 13 - 15 ] , cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) [ 16 - 19 ] , and superconducting mesocircuits [ 20 ] .",
    "trapped ions have been considered to be a promising candidate for quantum - information processing ( qip ) , due to long coherence time of qubits , full controllability of operations and high efficiency of detection . in",
    "[ 13 ] , a many - qubit grover search algorithm based on the hot - ion quantum computing [ 21 ] in decoherence - free subspace was proposed , where collective dephasing errors could be kept away from the qubit encoding . ref . [ 14 ] is an alternative for simulating grover search algorithm in an ion - trap system , in which the search could be carried out by more than two qubits .",
    "however , in order to achieve the conditional phase flip ( cpf ) gate , each ion should be illuminated by two lasers with different polarizations .",
    "in addition , the proposal needs not only elaborately designed sequences of lasers , but also the auxiliary states of the ions , which would result in considerable difficulty in experimental realization with growing number of the qubits .    in this paper , we propose a potentially practical scheme for implementing n - qubit @xmath1 grover search in an ion trap .",
    "compared to above mentioned schemes , our scheme includes following merits : we carry out the cpf gates with nearly unity success probability and fidelity in a straightforward way , which could relax the rigid requirement on accurate sequences of laser manipulations in previous work , such as sequences for one - qubit and two - qubit gates [ 12,22 ] or swap gates [ 23 ] . moreover",
    ", the increase of qubits in our scheme could improve the fidelity and the success probability of the cpf gate , which are favorable for a scalable grover search .",
    "section ii describles the general method for a cpf gate in a linear ion trap .",
    "we then describle , in sec .",
    "iv , the implementation of @xmath2-qubit grover search algorithm based on the proposed cpf gates , which is almost within the reach of the present technology and extendable to other qip candidate systems .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in sec . v.",
    "we consider @xmath2 identical three - level ions confined in a linear ion trap , as shown in fig . 1 where the ions are individually irradiated with traveling wave laser fields tuned to the first lower vibrational ( i.e. , red ) sideband .",
    "the three - level ionic states under our consideration are denoted by @xmath3and @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6  being states lower than @xmath7 . because the resonant transition happens between @xmath8  and @xmath9 by the laser field",
    ", @xmath5 is not involved in the interaction throughout our scheme . in the rotating wave approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian in units of @xmath10 reads,@xmath11\\ } , \\label{1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath12 $ ] is the positive frequency part of the driving laser with amplitude @xmath13 and frequency @xmath14 @xmath15  @xmath16  is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the center - of - mass vibrational mode commonly owned by all the ions , @xmath17  @xmath18  and @xmath19 are the raising , lowering and inversion operators for the @xmath20th trapped ion , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22  and @xmath23  are the trap frequency , the atomic transition frquency and dipole matrix element ( assumed to be real as convention ) , respectively . in the resolved sideband limit and in the interaction picture , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( 1 ) excluding the terms associated with carrier transition can be simplified to [ 24],@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the lamb - dicke parameter with @xmath26 being the mass of the ion .",
    "we assume the laser pulses to be time - dependent in gaussian type , and the time varying rabi frequency @xmath27 of the laser field is given by@xmath28 with @xmath29 being the duration of the gaussian shaped pulse irradiating on the @xmath20th ion .",
    "in the lamb - dicke regime , the hamiltonian can be approximated by the expansion to the first order in @xmath30@xmath31 furthermore , by assuming @xmath32 we reduce eq .",

    "one of the key steps in grover search algorithm is to find a marked element in an unsorted database of size n. generally speaking , the grover search algorithm consists of three kinds of operations [ 13 ] .",

    "( 20 ) implies that the diffusion transform @xmath155 is always unchanged no matter which state is to be searched .",

    "along with @xmath189 described in above section , all the necessary operations for grover search are available in a straightforward way .",
    "therefore , based on the reliable control of the laser pulses on stationary ions , we could carry out a four - qubit grover algorithm with four - qubit cpf gates and a series of single - qubit gatings according to the operations plotted in fig .",
    "4 . as a result",
    ", we consider that our scheme could significantly reduce the overhead for qip tasks with trapped ions due to direct implementation of n - qubit cpf gates .    as the grover search involving more than two qubits",
    "is carried out only probabilistically , how to obtain an optimal search is a problem of much interest . considering the success probability of the cpf gate ( i.e. , eq .",
    "( 17 ) )  and the intrinsic probability of the grover search itself , we show by numerical simulation the implementation of the grover search in fig .",
    "5 . due to the similarity",
    ", we only demonstrate the search for a marked state in the case of @xmath139 @xmath190 and @xmath191 which demonstrates the decreasing success rates with the increase of @xmath132 and the qubit number .",
    "we briefly address the experimental feasibility of our scheme . we may employ @xmath192 @xmath193 and @xmath194 of@xmath195  [ 27 ] as the states @xmath196 @xmath46 and @xmath197 respectively .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath198  of the @xmath199 ion is longer than @xmath200 @xmath201 and the transition between @xmath47 and @xmath46 is dipolar forbidden@xmath83 to carry out the cpf gate in the present scheme , the condition _",

    ", all the above - mentioned relations could be met in the weak - excitation regime @xmath206 ( which implies a negligible ac stark shift induced by the radiation ) , where one may expect the unwanted off - resonant transition to be disregarded on the precondition that the laser field can not be made too intense at any rate , which thereby is regarded as the dominating limiting factor on the resulting relatively - low gate speed [ 28 ] .",
    "taking our proposed @xmath2-qubit cpf gate as an example , for a typical value @xmath207 of the lamb - dicke parameter , we have listed the required time @xmath208 for cpf gate operation in table ii , which clearly indicate that the values of @xmath208 are prolonged with the growth of the number of ions .",
    "in addition , the switching rate of the cpf gate will be of order @xmath209 which , from the viewpoint of heating effect , will inevitably bring out disadvantaged impact on the construction of cpf gate .",
    "alternatively , in what follows we will take into account another different regimes @xmath210 where the only new requirement we should make is that the laser should take a fixed intensity satisfaying the resonance condition [ 28 ] @xmath211 which implies an improvement by two orders of magnitude with respect to the cpf gating time in the case of weak - excitation .",
    "so to reduce the implementation time @xmath208 , we may choose such a stronger radiation with @xmath212 for a carrier transition .",
    "our direct calculation based on the model in [ 28 ] shows that we could also have eq .",

    "as the heating time of the ground vibrational state of the ions in the linear trap is about _ 4 millisec [ 29 ] _ , the implementation time in the case of strong radiation seems better in view of avoiding heating .",
    "note also that single - qubit operation takes negligible time in comparison with that for many - qubit phase gating , so direct calculation shows that one iteration of our proposed grover search would take @xmath219 which is shorter than the the heating time of the ions . in this sense , the decoherence originating from the heating effect",

    "+       it is generally considered that the computing operation on trapped ions in a linear ion trap would be more and more intricate with the increase of the number of ions . because of the decrease of the spatial separation of the trapped ions , individual manipulation is more and more difficult , and meanwhile the vibrational mode spectrum becomes more and more unresolved . as a result ,",
    "the extension of quantum computation from a few qubits to large numbers of qubits is quite technically challenging . in this sense , although our proposal is in principle scalable , the currently technical level regarding the linear trap restricts the application of our scheme .",
    "nevertheless , eight ultracold ions in the linear trap could be individually addressed and entangled [ 30 ] .",
    "therefore , if we apply our scheme to these eight ions , a gorver search with @xmath228 states could be achieved in a simpler way .",
    "alternatively , we may consider the application of our scheme in a multi - zone trap , in which we may carry out our scheme on few ions in separate zones , respectively , and then entangle a large numbers of ions by moving the ions between different zones [ 31 ] . this is a possible way to a large - scale grover search implementation .",
    "we have reiterated our scheme to achieve a cpf gate in one step , which could save the implementation time and steps compared to conventional methods .",
    "moreover the most impressive feature of our scheme is the higher fidelity and higher success rate with more qubits involved , which favors large - scale qip .",
    "nevertheless , the more qubits , the more steps necessary for an optimal grover search . as the cpf gate proposed here is intrinsically imperfect , a decrease of the fidelity is inevitable with more qubits involved , even if we neglect the unpredictable imperfection and decoherence in actually experimental situation .",
    "anyway , the curent experimental progress has shown some efficient ways to deal with the imperfection [ 32 ] .",
    "other basic operations are also available because the qubit encoding in the first n-1 ions is like that done in oxford s group [ 26 ] and the qubit encoding in the last ion is employed in innsbruck s group [ 27 ] .",
    "so we believe that our proposal for grover search should be available with current or near - future techniques .    in summary , a potentially practical scheme for performing @xmath2-qubit cpf gate as well as the many - qubit grover search algorithm has been proposed in the ion - trap system . we have demonstrated both analytically and numerically that , our scheme could be achieved efficiently to find a marked state with high fidelity and high success probability .",
    "our proposal could be employed in both the linear ion trap and the multizone trap , and may also be applied to other qip tasks , such as preparation of cluster states for one - way quantum computation [ 33 ] .",
