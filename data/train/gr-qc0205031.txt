    "gravitational field and dynamics of extended objects ( membranes ) are familiar topics in recent physics .",
    "historically , gravity of membranes is investigated in the context of topological defects formed during phase transition in the early universe@xcite . among these extended objects ,",
    "domain walls are the simplest type of defects which arose when the phase transition has occurred by the breakdown of a discrete symmetry . however , the theoretical prediction using standard scaling defect models are in conflict with observations of the cosmic background explorer satellite@xcite .",
    "further , stable domain wall networks are not allowed in the early universe because they overdominate the radiation energy density@xcite . despite of these discouraging results ,",
    "topological defects have been remained intrinsically interesting topics to study extended objects .",
    "unstable defects formed in the early universe might radiate gravitational waves by their rapid oscillation@xcite and then the detection of relic gravitational waves from these extended objects is considered to be one of the evidences for the phase transition in the universe .",
    "moreover , as seen in the recent proposal of the theoretical models with the large extradimension@xcite , so called brane world scenario , domain walls are considered as a realization of our universe in higher dimensions .    within the general relativity ,",
    "topological defects are unusual and are expected to play a role of an interesting source of gravity . in the simplest case , domain walls are idealized by the infinitesimally thin nambu - goto membranes .",
    "if the self - gravity of membranes is ignored ( test membrane case ) , the nambu - goto action admits oscillatory solutions which radiate gravitational waves as mentioned above .",
    "however , by taking into account the self - gravity of the nambu - goto wall , it is shown that self - gravitating walls coupled to gravitational wave behave in a quite different manner .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom concerning the perturbative oscillations around spherical walls is given by that of gravitational waves , and self - gravitating spherical walls do not oscillate spontaneously contrary to the case of test walls@xcite .",
    "the essentially same conclusion is also obtained in the case of an infinite nambu - goto string@xcite .",
    "these results insist that the motion of gravitating membranes is quite different from the motion of the test membranes even if the total energy of the wall is very small .",
    "this difference between test membranes and self - gravitating membranes is crucial when one estimates the energy of the gravitational waves from these extended objects .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the gravitational wave emission due to the motion of a nambu - goto wall .",
    "particularly , we consider the cylindrically symmetric domain wall as a toy model of highly elongated gravitating walls .",
    "the results that the gravitating nambu - goto membrane has no dynamical degree of freedom of are based on the perturbation around the spacetime without gravitational wave .",
    "we expect that the behavior of highly distorted nambu - goto walls is different .",
    "the cylindrically symmetric spacetime considered here is described by the metric of the _ weyl canonical form_. in this metric , there are cylindrically symmetric wave modes , which is called _ einstein - rosen wave _ ( er wave ) , and a domain wall s motion excites er wave .",
    "we have to treat the coupled system of er wave and the cylindrically symmetric domain wall , which is governed by the einstein equation and the junction condition@xcite on the wall .",
    "we first show that all spacetimes containing a cylindrical wall become singular if we neglect er wave emission .",
    "this implies that , in the absence of singularities , er wave emission necessarily occurs by the motion of the cylindrical wall .",
    "next , we consider the momentarily static `` regular '' initial data for the spacetime containing a cylindrical domain wall and their infinitesimal time evolution .",
    "we show that the monotonically collapsing motion of the gravitating cylindrical wall does emit gravitational waves and that the estimate of the energy of gravitational waves using the quadrupole formula is correct if the wall energy density is sufficiently small .",
    "this is the quite reasonable result expected from the behavior of the nambu - goto membrane in the absence of gravity .",
    "however , we have to notice that this result has an apparent discrepancy with the results in ref.@xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the symmetry reduction of spacetime into the cylindrically symmetric one .",
    "we also derive the basic equations that govern the motion of the domain wall . in sec.iii",
    ", we consider the possible solutions of a self - gravitating domain wall without gravitational wave emission . in sec.iv , we set up momentarily static and radiation free regular initial configurations and investigate the time evolution to see the gravitational wave emission due to the wall motion . finally , sec.v is devoted to the summary and discussions about the discrepancy with the conclusion in ref.@xcite .    throughout this paper",

    "the appearance of @xmath219 , which depends on the amplitude @xmath220 of outgoing er wave , arises from the back reaction of er emission . since @xmath219 has the opposite sign to the acceleration , the back reaction of er wave emission diminishes the absolute value of the wall acceleration in this order .",

    "in summary , we have considered the spacetime with a self - gravitating cylindrical domain wall using the thin wall approximation .",
    "we considered two classes of solutions , separately , solutions with and without gravitational waves emission .",
    "first , we found two subclasses of solutions without gravitational wave emission : static wall solutions and dynamically moving wall solutions .",
    "the spacetimes that are described by the solutions have singularities inevitably .",
    "next , we set up momentarily static and radiation free initial configurations of the system .",
    "we found that @xmath233_``wall s mass per unit proper length''_@xmath234 should hold initially for regular initial configurations . in the exceptional case of _ `` wall s mass per unit proper length''_@xmath235 , we found that the initial surface is closed radially .",
    "in these two regular initial configurations , the domain wall has non - vanishing initial acceleration .",
    "we also considered the time evolution from the above initial data within the infinitesimal time interval . by the accelerated motion of the wall ,",
    "er wave emission does occur .",
    "and the wave emission affects the wall motion in the next moment .",
    "this is just the radiation reaction problem .",
    "in contrast to the test wall motion in minkowski spacetime , the radiation reaction diminishes the acceleration of the wall .",
    "we also found that the amplitude of the emitted wave depends on the gravitational potential produced by the wall on the initial surface .",
    "further , the back reaction of the wave emission to the wall motion depends both on the amplitude of the wave and on the gravitational potential . as the result",
    ", a cylindrical domain wall with the large initial mass produces the large gravitational potential . the wall motion in the large potential yields the large amount of the er wave . by this strong er wave emission",
    "the large back reaction to the wall motion does occur .    here",
    ", we compare the motion of the self - gravitating wall with that of the test wall . when @xmath236 , the back reaction to the wall motion by er wave emission is negligible since the wall collapse to @xmath84 before the back reaction becomes significant .",
    "then , when @xmath236 , the motion of a self - gravitating wall is well approximated by those of test walls . in the weak gravity limit , the energy loss rate by er wave emission is estimated from eq.([weak_energy_loss ] ) .",
    "since the collapsing time scale is given by @xmath237 , the energy loss rate per length along @xmath17 direction is @xmath238 though eq.([weak_energy_loss ] ) is not valid when @xmath239 , we have extrapolated it .",
    "we note that the energy loss rate ( [ estimate_weak_energy_loss ] ) does agree with that roughly estimated from the quadrupole formula for gravitational wave emission .",
    "this is our main conclusion in this paper .",
    "the results obtained here are quite reasonable and these are expected from the behavior of the test nambu - goto wall in the absence of their self - gravity . however , the behaviors of gravitating nambu - goto membranes obtained in refs.@xcite are different from those of test membranes .",
    "we must note that the behavior similar to that in refs.@xcite is also obtained in the er wave scattering by the cylindrical domain wall in the static background as seen in appendix [ sec : scattering ] , i.e. , there is no solution which corresponds to the spontaneous oscillation of the wall .",
    "further , we see that the cylindrical domain wall considered in appendix [ sec : scattering ] is unstable .",
    "the unstable mode is not oscillatory mode .",
    "though our analysis in appendix [ sec : scattering ] is restricted to the perturbation of er wave , we expect that the oscillatory behavior of the wall , the oscillatory behavior is same as those in refs.@xcite .    together with the results from some models in refs.@xcite and in this paper",
    ", we conjecture that the oscillatory motion of test walls fails to approximate that of a self - gravitating wall , but monotonically collapsing motions of the self - gravitating wall are well approximated by those of the test wall if its energy density is sufficiently small .",
    "further , the energy of gravitational waves emitted by monotonic motions of the walls is estimated by the quadruple formula .    of course , in the dynamics of domain walls in the realistic situation in the early universe , the effective equation of state of an oscillating wall may change , analogous to that of the wiggling cosmic string@xcite .",
    "this is pointed out by bonjour et.al@xcite .",
    "this change will be the effect to be taken into account when we discuss the dynamics of domain walls in the realistic situation in the early universe .",
    "however , we should emphasize that our discussion is concentrated on the difference between the oscillatory behavior of a gravitating nambu - goto membrane and a test nambu - goto membrane .",
    "at least , the oscillatory behavior of gravitating nambu - goto membranes is quite different from that of test membranes , while monotonically collapsing motion is well approximated by the test membranes .",
    "this suggests that the energy of gravitational waves estimated by the oscillating test membranes might be incorrect .",
    "though the full dynamics of gravitating nambu - goto membranes is not clear yet , to estimate the energy of gravitational waves from defects , we should clarify the dynamics of nambu - goto membranes at first .",
    "after that , the effect of the change in the equation of state should be included .",
    "though the gravitational waves might be emitted by this change , this physical process is different from that discussed here .",

    "<S> gravitational field of a cylindrical nambu - goto wall in the vacuum spacetime is considered in order to clarify the interaction between nambu - goto membranes and gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> if one neglects the emission of gravitational waves by the wall motion , the spacetime becomes singular . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the emission of gravitational waves does occur by the motion of the cylindrical wall if the initial data is singularity free . </S>",
    "<S> the energy loss rate due to radiation of gravitational waves agrees with that estimated from the test wall motion and the quadrupole formula for the gravitational wave emission . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite different from the oscillatory behavior of gravitating nambu - goto membranes : the presence of gravity induces the wall to lose its dynamical degree of freedom .    2 </S>"
