    "the high - quality single crystals were grown by a self - flux method which was mentioned in ref .",
    "resistance was measured with a standard four - probe technique on a rotator under pulsed magnetic field which can reach 60 t. the four contacts were attached to 25 @xmath28 m diameter gold wires by using dupont 4929n silver paint in an ar filled glove box .",
    "the samples were mounted on the rotator probe with a sapphire substrate .",
    "all the procedures were done in the glove box . after removing the probe from the glove box , we replaced ar gas in the sample space with helium gas which was served as exchanging gas .",
    "the electrical current was applied along the rod direction .",
    "the rotational axis is either perpendicular or parallel to the rod .",
    "so the magnetic field direction could be adjusted _ in - situ_. the angles could be extracted from the ratio of a coil attached to the back of the rotating platform to the pick - up coil for field .",
    "note that the sample was air - sensitive and could nt be reused .",
    "we thus employed different samples for different measurements .",
    "nevertheless , we checked that the results were reproducible .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 value is defined by the crossing point of the normal and superconducting states , as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1a and 1b . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath0 data are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the obtained @xmath38 phase diagram is similar to the previous profile@xcite , featured by the crossing of @xmath35 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> such a reversal of anisotropy in @xmath0 , although being uncommon , was reported in several other systems including the quasi-1d organic superconductor ( tmtsf)@xmath4pf@xmath39@xcite , the heavy - fermion superconductor upt@xmath5@xcite , and some of the iron - based superconductors@xcite . the origin of the anisotropy reversal differs for different systems . for the iron - based superconductors , which are believed to have multi bands with spin - singlet cooper pairs , pauli - limiting effect with spin - orbit coupling plays the dominant role for the phenomenon@xcite . as for the quasi-1d organic superconductor , </S>",
    "<S> a field - induced dimension crossover is responsible for the crossing of @xmath0@xcite . in the case of upt@xmath15 , a triplet sc with odd parity </S>",
    "<S> was proposed to explain the anisotropy inversion@xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> apparently , the reversal in anisotropy suggests a dimension crossover ( note that there are `` k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 '' atomic planes at @xmath40=0 and @xmath40=1/2 in the crystal structure@xcite ) , like the case in ( tmtsf)@xmath4pf@xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath8 data in fig . 2 still show modulations at the `` crossover '' temperature of 3.1 k. this is inconsistent with the expected angle dependence , @xmath41 , which yields a constant @xmath0 for @xmath42 . even at 1.9 k , where @xmath43 , small peaks at @xmath440@xmath45 and 180@xmath45 are present . </S>",
    "<S> these indicate that the uniaxial anisotropy is still there , and the dimension crossover scenario can be ruled out .    as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c , @xmath31 deviates from the linearity for @xmath46 5.5 k. the negative curvature as well as the tendency of saturation at lower temperatures suggests a dominant paramagnetically pair - breaking mechanism for @xmath31 . in contrast , @xmath35 basically shows a linear behavior with a slightly positive curvature , or a kink , at about 5.5 k. these data clearly indicate that @xmath35 is dominantly limited by an orbital effect . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the crossing of @xmath31 and @xmath35 possibly comes from different pair - breaking mechanisms for the different external field directions .    as the scenario in upt@xmath15 , the crossing of @xmath35 and @xmath31 can be naturally explained in terms of a spin - triplet pairing with spins locked within @xmath47 planes . in upt@xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> ( see table i in sm ) , the order parameter has ( dominantly ) odd parity with a @xmath48 vector locked to the @xmath34 axis owing to strong spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the spin of the odd - parity cooper pairs may be @xmath49 with @xmath50=0 , which is equivalent to the spin state of @xmath51 . in this circumstance , </S>",
    "<S> the zeeman energy breaks the cooper pairs for @xmath52 , hence the pauli - limiting behavior for @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the perpendicular field simply changes the population of cooper pairs with spin directions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and therefore , no paramagnetic pair - breaking is expected for @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> here we note that , owing to the non - centrosymmetric crystal structure in k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 , the actual pairing symmetry is usually a mixture of singlet and triplet states,@xcite except for the case of simple @xmath55 wave in which a pure triplet pairing is anticipated because of the mirror - plane reflection symmetry@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the in - plane @xmath11 modulation ( see below ) seems to support the dominant @xmath56-wave order parameter which originates from the 3d @xmath57 band@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another outstanding feature of the out - of - plane @xmath0 measurements shown in fig.2 : approaching the @xmath16 , the @xmath0 monotonously increases as the angle tilted from @xmath52 , as the g - l theory predicts . but as the temperature is decreased , two maximum @xmath0 appear at @xmath7 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 show a rare nonmonotonous feature and has a valley feature with the tilted angle . </S>",
    "<S> the angle corresponding to the valley is also moving as the temperature is lowered . obviously , two effects are competing , leading to the intriguing valley feature . </S>",
    "<S> below we show such two abnormal features in out - of - plane @xmath8 could be naturally explained by combining the zeeman effect and orbit effect to the @xmath0 in the frame of spin - triplet pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the anisotropy by the triplet pairing with @xmath58 , the effective - mass anisotropy leads to the anisotropy of the orbitally limited @xmath59 , @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the presumed orbitally limited upper critical field for * * h**@xmath62 and , @xmath63 is the effective - mass ratio . combining both the orbital and zeeman effects , </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , the @xmath73 , 3.4 time of @xmath24 , is totally determined by the orbital effect . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of paramagnetic pair breaking for @xmath7 strongly suggests spin - triplet cooper pairing in k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 .    using the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) relation , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the flux quantum , </S>",

    "<S> the anisotropy reversal in @xmath0 was explained by paramagnetic limiting for @xmath31 if the order parameter has odd parity and there is strong spin - orbit coupling of the pair spins to the in - plane crystal axes@xcite . additionally , upt@xmath15 shows sixfold modulation in the in - plane @xmath11@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic @xmath98 even reverses its sign at the tetracritical point@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a modulation can be explained in terms of a coupling to the symmetry breaking field . </S>",
    "<S> the latter was supported by neutron diffraction study which shows an antiferromagnetism whose moments are lying within the basal plane@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed @xmath11 modulation in k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 here suggests that the electron spins in cooper pairs should be locked within the basal plane ( probably along @xmath90 or @xmath91 axis ) . </S>",

    "<S> consequently , k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 is nearby a novel in - out co - planar magnetic ground state@xcite , in which the magnetic moments lie in the basal plane . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic - susceptibility anisotropy@xcite can be understood by the antiferromagnetic correlations among the spins , which leads to a _ reduced _ magnetic susceptibility for field parallel to the basal plane .    the spin - singlet sc with the electron spins locked onto the @xmath34-axis direction seems not physically reasonable , because a spin - singlet cooper pair is a rotationally invariant object and thus it should have no preferred direction . </S>",
    "<S> the exception is that the ising - spins exist already in normal state , which should cause a large magnetic anisotropy at odds with the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic susceptibility for field along the cr - chain direction is about 20% larger@xcite . for a spin - triplet pairing </S>",
    "<S> , however , a spin - locking scenario is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane spin - structure has antiferromagnetic configuration@xcite , shown at the lower - right corner of fig.3 , the small out - of - plane anisotropy is understandable as mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> so we conclude the spin - triplet scenario is more favorable , and can easily explain all the observations .    before closing , we comment on the relation between triplet sc and the impurity scattering effect on @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> it is true that nonmagnetic scattering can be a source of pair breaking even at zero field for an odd - parity unconventional superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> however , such an effect will not be evident in the clean - limit regime , i. e. the electron mean free path @xmath99 is much larger than the superconducting coherence length @xmath100 . in k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 , @xmath99 is estimated to be @xmath8974.6 nm for the electron transport along the @xmath34 axis in the sample with rrr=61 ( see the sm ) , and @xmath78 is only 3.5 nm , thus @xmath101 holds in most cases . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the @xmath16 keeps unchanged for samples with different rrrs . </S>",
    "<S> our recent results show that the tiny impurity can dramatically affect the superconductivity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we note that an odd - parity superconducting state may even be protected against disorder by a spin - orbit locking.@xcite    in conclusion , we performed detailed @xmath97 measurements on superconducting k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 crystals . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the `` anisotropy - reversal '' phenomenon and a rare nonmonotonous feature of @xmath8 with tilted angle at low temperature are due to different pair - breaking mechanisms for different magnetic - field directions . </S>",
    "<S> remarkable , the @xmath8 can be perfectly fitted by treating with spin - triplet scenario . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , spin - orbit coupling plays an important role not only for determining @xmath31 but also for locking the electron spins onto a particular direction . </S>",
    "<S> the large values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which far exceed the pauli limit , and in particular , the absence of paramagnetic pair breaking for @xmath7 , concordantly indicate a dominant spin - triplet cooper pairing in k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this verifies the previous implications / suggestions of the most related experimental / theoretical studies@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also observed for the first time a unique three - fold modulation in @xmath11 , which is consistent with the spin locking along the @xmath90 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the above information for the spin structure of the cooper pairs helps the final determination of the superconducting order parameter in k@xmath4cr@xmath5as@xmath5 , which may expand the overall understanding of unconventional superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the dominant triplet pairing may bear an intriguing topological sc , similar to the theoretical prediction in upt@xmath5 @xcite . </S>"
