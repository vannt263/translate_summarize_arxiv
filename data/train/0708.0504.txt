    "the study of the ism and its kinematics enables us to address one of the more interesting questions in galactic evolution : by what mechanism or mechanisms is the optical appearance of a galaxy related to the evolution of its spiral or barred structure in response to the underlying dynamics of its stellar and gaseous components , and what is the role of such evolution on star formation in the host galaxy ? at a distance of 5.5 mpc , ngc 6946 provides us with a good opportunity to study and characterize the properties of interstellar gas and dust in detail .",
    "the observations were taken with the fabry - perot interferometer fantomm ( hernandez , gach , carignan & boulesteix 2003 ) at the 1.6-m telescope at the observatoire du mont m@xmath1gantic , qu@xmath1bec , canada .",
    "the resulting data cube of 40 planes separated by 0.21 @xmath2 was used to derive flux , line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersion for each position .",
    "the radial velocity map shows the presence of a small , asymmetrically extended , inner bar - like system embedded in a large - scale rotating structure .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the tremaine & weinberg method ( 1984 ) makes it possible to measure the pattern speed of a barred disk galaxy without adopting a particular dynamical model .",
    "it is based on the ratio of measurements of the distribution of intensityweighted velocity and position of a component that reacts to the density wave .",
    "we use this method with the refinement of merrifield & kuijken ( 1995 ) .",
    "the distribution of the measurements along two lines in fig .",
    "1a suggests not one , but _ two _ distinct pattern speeds for measurements including and excluding the central regions .",
    "this observational result suggests the presence of an additional , inner pattern that rotates at a different pattern speed roughly inside the oilr .",
    "the outer pattern rotates at 21.7 ( + 0.5,-0.5 ) km / s / kpc and the inner pattern rotates at 47.0 ( + 1.4,-1.4 ) km / s / kpc .",
    "we use the epicycle approximation to deduce the location of the lindblad resonance radii ( ilr ) and the corotation radius .",
    "1b shows the ( @xmath3)-curve .",
    "this indicates two ilrs ; an iilr and oilr .",
    "as described by maciejewski ( 2004 ) , the curve can be interpreted as representing a galaxy without a central mass concentration or density cusp .",
    "1b also indicates that a bar - like system with solid - body rotation has evolved inside the iilr as confirmed by the steeply rising rotation curve in this galaxy.in a forthcoming paper , we will present an extended analysis of the pattern speeds and a diagnosis of the resonance radii , within the framework of epicycle approximation , in ngc 6946 .",
