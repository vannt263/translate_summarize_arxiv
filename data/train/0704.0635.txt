    "in a standard scenario , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) can produce only light elements , up to @xmath0li , and all heavy elements have been synthesized in stars . however , many phase transitions in the early universe could have printed their trace in a non - standard way . for example , some baryogenesis models@xcite predict very high baryon density islands in ordinary low density backgrounds .    in the previous paper@xcite",
    ", we studied heavy element production in inhomogeneous bbn from this point of view .",
    "however we limited ourselves to the heavy element abundance and did not discuss about the light element abundance and consistency with observations .",
    "this is because we assumed that high baryon density region is very local and do not affect the global light element abundance . in @xcite , rauscher pointed out that in order not to contradict to observations , the high baryon density region must be very small and can not affect the present heavy element abundance . in this paper , we show that there is a parameter region in which the heavy element can be produced enough to affect observation while keeping the light element abundance consistent with observations .",
    "we consider that the disagreement between rauscher s opinion and our opinion comes from two points .",
    "one is that we are looking at some parameter regions in which neutrons in high baryon density do not diffuse so much as to cause disaster in standard bbn .",
    "we would like to emphasize this point .",
    "the other is that the relevant quantity is not the spatial size of the high baryon density region but the amount of baryon in high density regions .",
    "we will discuss the following issues : in section [ lea ] , we discuss the light element abundance in the homogeneous high baryon density region and after mixing the high and the low baryon density region . in section [ heavy ] , we study the heavy element(ru , mo ) abundance in high and averaged baryon density and show that heavy elements can be produced enough without contradicting the light element observation . in section",
    "[ diff ] , we briefly comment on the diffusion scale of the high baryon density region .",
    "we calculate homogeneous bbn with various values of @xmath1(baryon photon ratio ) . in table.[light - table ] and [ light - normal ] , we show the numerical result of the mass fraction and the number fraction of each light element for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "most of the final product of @xmath26 comes from @xmath27 which decays to @xmath26 after bbn .",
    "details on light element production for various @xmath1 can also be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we almost concentrate on a case in which the high baryon density region has @xmath2 .",
    "we expect that compared to @xmath28 , the profile of the abundance for @xmath2 is more different from standard bbn because most of the light element abundances change monotonically with respect to @xmath1 and if this case does not contradict to observations , other cases would also be consistent .",
    "briefly , the amount of @xmath29 decreases and @xmath30 increases monotonically as @xmath1 become larger .",
    "the number fraction of @xmath31 is less than @xmath32 for @xmath1 greater than @xmath33 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the number fraction drastically decreases around @xmath35 down to @xmath36 , and for @xmath26 , the number fraction increases until @xmath37 and drastically decreases for a larger value of @xmath1 . in the following sections , we will see that this non - standard setup does not strongly contradict to the observations . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the diffusion effect before and during bbn , and after bbn both high and low baryon density regions are completely mixed .",
    "detailed analysis such as the case in which the high baryon density region does nt completely mixed , or taking into account diffusion effects are left for future work .      in this section ,",
    "we summarize the relations among parameters .",
    "notations : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are averaged , high , and low baryon number density . @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the volume fractions of the high and the low baryon density region .",
    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the mass fractions of each element ( i ) in averaged- , high- and low - density regions .",
    "the basic relations are @xmath46 under the assumption that the temperature of the universe is homogeneous , the above equation can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48,@xmath49 conventional parameters for inhomogeneous bbn are @xmath1 , @xmath50 and density ratio @xmath51 . here we use a different combination of parameters .",
    "relevant values for the abundance analysis are products @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 determines the amount of baryon from high- and low- density regions .",
    "@xmath53 determines the mass fraction of each species of nuclei . for convenience ,",
    "we write the ratio of baryon number contribution from high density region as @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "there are 5 parameters(@xmath57 and @xmath58 ) and 2 constraints ( eq.([vol ] ) and eq.([density ] ) ) .",
    "we calculate the light element abundance for various values of @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath1 can also take any value , but in order not to contradict observational constraints , we choose @xmath1 from @xmath3 to @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath55 is determined by eq([denseta ] ) .",
    "the aim of the analysis in this section is not to find parameter regions which precisely agree with the observational light element abundance and @xmath1 from cmb .",
    "our model is too simple to determine the constraints to parameters .",
    "for example , we completely ignore the diffusion effect before and during bbn .",
    "instead we see that at least our analysis in previous paper is physically reasonable .",
    "we consider the cases of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the mass fractions of and @xmath29 and @xmath34 in the high density region are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , while those in the low density region are @xmath64 and @xmath65 . from eq.([speceta ] ) , we have @xmath66 @xmath67    we can calculate an averaged value of the abundance ratio of @xmath68he to h as    @xmath69    where @xmath55 is related to @xmath1 as @xmath70 here @xmath55 varies from 0 to 0.9 for reasonable values of @xmath1 , or @xmath71 . similarly , for @xmath60 the number fractions are @xmath72    @xmath73    fig.[deps],[heeps ] and [ lieps ] represent the averaged abundance ratio , ( d / h ) , ( @xmath9he / h ) and ( @xmath0li / h ) respectively .    , width=340 ]     but for ( @xmath68he / h),width=340 ]     but for ( @xmath0li / h),width=340 ]    we can see that the light element abundance is the same order around @xmath74 as observations @xcite .",
    "@xmath75    we do not discuss detail about diffusion here .",
    "but at least above result suggest that our analysis is not beside the point .",
    "the same analysis can be applied for heavy elements such as @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we are interested in these elements because in many models of supernovae nucleosynthesis , these p - nuclei are less produced .",
    "we will see that some amount of these heavy elements can be synthesized in bbn .",

    ".the abundances of @xmath76mo and @xmath77ru in the solar system@xcite [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     compared those observational values with fig.[combps ] , it is clear that the heavy element produced in bbn can affect the solar abundance heavy element . some of them are produced too much .",
    "but this is not a problem of the previous work @xcite , because we assumed that high density regions are very small and do not disturb standard bbn .",
    "the analysis here suggest that even if we assume the density fluctuations are completely mixed , heavy element can have enough affect to the solar abundance .",
    "in the previous analysis , we assumed that the diffusion effect can be ignored during bbn and both high density regions and low density regions are completely mixed after bbn . in this section , we determine the scale of high baryon density island in which the diffusion effect during bbn is very small enough and our assumption is valid .",
    "we do not discuss the diffusion after bbn here .    a detail analysis of the comoving diffusion distance of the baryon , the neutron and the proton is in @xcite .",
    "from fig.1 in @xcite , in order to safely ignore the diffusion effect , it is necessary for the high baryon density island to be much larger than @xmath96 cm at t=0.1mev(@xmath97k ) .",
    "notice that @xmath98 , where a is a scale factor",
    ". for scale d now corresponds to @xmath99 at bbn epoch .",

    "the size of universe is @xmath107mpc . in order not to contradict to cmb observation",
    ", the fluctuation of baryon density must be less than @xmath108mpc now .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath109 cm at bbn .",
    "since the density fluctuation size in dolgov and silk s model@xcite is a free parameter , the above brief estimation suggests that we can take the island size large enough to ignore the diffusion effect without contradicting to observations , i.e. , the reasonable size of @xmath96 cm @xmath110@xmath109 cm at the bbn epoch",
    ". we can choose distances between high density islands so that we obtain a suitable value of @xmath50 .",
    "in this paper , we studied the relation between the heavy element production in high baryon density regions during bbn and the light element observation . by averaging the light element abundances in the high and the low density regions we showed that it is possible to produce a relevant amount of heavy element without contradicting to observations .",
    "however we should stress that in this paper we restricted ourselves to some parameter regions where neutrons in high baryon density regions do not destroy the standard bbn .",
    "so our setup is different from the conventional inhomogeneous bbn studies .",
    "we also studied the size of the density fluctuation to show that there is a parameter region in which the neutron diffusion is negligible and which is much smaller than cmb observation scale .",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate further how the produced heavy elements can be related to the detailed observations .",
