    "electronic scattering at the interface between a normal metal ( n ) and a superconductor has been studied by blonder , tinkham and klapwijk@xcite ( btk ) and it was found that the subgap conductance is enhanced due to andreev reflection . on the other hand , the fermi velocity mismatch between the two metals always produces an effective barrier which decreases the conductance @xcite .",
    "if the superconductor is a heavy - fermion ( hfs ) , the greater fermi velocity mismatch would lead us to expect a strongly reduced subgap conductance .",
    "experimentally , however , the subgap conductance does not seem to be strongly reduced in n / hfs junctions . an argument to explain this behavior has been put forward by deutcher and nozires@xcite , who claimed that mass enhancement factors in the heavy - fermion metal do not cause impedance at the interface .    motivated by recent experiments@xcite on au / cecoin@xmath0 interfaces , we study electron scattering at the interface between a normal ( light ) metal ( n ) and a heavy - fermion superconductor .",
    "starting from a more realistic two - band model for the hfs , where a conduction @xmath1-electron band hybridizes with a localized @xmath2-electron band , plane - wave solutions for each bulk subsystem can be written down .",
    "we explicitly obtain the matching conditions for the wave function at the interface and confirm the claim in ref@xcite , by explicitly showing that the electron velocities involved are those of the conduction @xmath1-bands .",
    "since the localized @xmath2-electrons are dispersionless , only the @xmath1-conduction electrons satisfy matching conditions at the interface .",
    "this is the basis of the result .",
    "an extension to a two - fluid model of the hfs , where a normal light fluid coexists with the superconducting one , is also presented , which may be relevant to _ e.g. _ , cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "our theory is analogous to the quantum waveguide theory for mesoscopic structures@xcite .",
