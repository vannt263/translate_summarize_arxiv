    "the @xmath3 was first observed by babar @xcite in the process @xmath6 , and identified as a @xmath7 resonance , with @xmath8 gev and @xmath9 mev .",
    "this state was then confirmed by bes and denoted @xmath10 @xcite , from the decay @xmath11 , with @xmath12 gev and @xmath13 mev .",
    "it is now included in the pdg particle listings @xcite as the @xmath14 .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the @xmath3 has been descibed as a three - meson resonance in a faddeev calculation for the @xmath15 system @xcite , obtaining a narrow peak around 2150  mev , about @xmath16 mev wide .",
    "earlier , a conventional resonance - chiral - perturbation - theory calculation @xcite failed to produce such a peak , which led to the former 3-body model .",
    "other approaches include qcd - sum - rule calculations for a tetraquark state @xcite , and a perturbative multichannel analysis to distinguish between a strangeonium hybrid and a normal @xmath17 @xmath18 state @xcite .",
    "in the present study of the @xmath3 , we use the resonance - spectrum - expansion ( rse ) model @xcite to unitarise a normal @xmath18 spectrum . in the rse approach ,",
    "non - exotic mesons are described as regular quark - antiquark states , but non - perturbatively dressed with meson - meson components .",
    "an important feature is the inclusion of a complete @xmath19 confinement spectrum in the intermediate state @xcite , resulting for the multichannel case in an effective meson - meson potential @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an overall coupling constant , @xmath22 a parameter mimicking the average string - breaking distance , @xmath23 a spherical bessel function , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the relativistically defined relative momenta of initial channel @xmath26 and final channel @xmath27 , respectively , @xmath28 the coupling of channel @xmath26 to the @xmath29-th @xmath19 recurrence , and @xmath30 the discrete energy of the latter confinement state .",
    "note that the couplings @xmath28 , evaluated on a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis for the @xmath31 model @xcite , decrease very rapidly for increasing @xmath29 , so that practical convergence is achieved with the first 20 terms in the infinite sum .",
    "moreover , the separable form of the effective potential ( [ veff ] ) allows the solution of the ( relativistic ) lippmann - schwinger equation in closed form .    in the present first study",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the @xmath32 channel for the @xmath19 system .",
    "moreover , we assume ideal mixing , so that only @xmath18 states are considered . for the confinement mechanism",
    ", we take an ho potential . this choice is not strictly necessary , as eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) allows for any confinement spectrum , but the ho has shown to work fine in practically all phenomenological applications .",
    "the flavour - dependent ho spectrum reads @xmath33 the parameter values @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 mev are kept unchanged with respect to all previous work ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in table",
    "[ hos ] , we list some of the eigenvalues given by eq .",
    "( [ ho ] ) . as for the decay sector that couples to @xmath36 @xmath37 states",
    ", we take all pseudoscalar  pseudoscalar ( pp ) , pseudoscalar  vector ( pv ) , and vector  vector ( vv ) channels , which are in @xmath0-waves , as well as all vector  scalar ( vs ) , pseudoscalar  axial - vector ( pa ) , and vector  axial - vector ( va ) channels , being in @xmath1-waves .",
    "these 15 channels are listed in table  [ mm ] , including the observed @xcite @xmath38 mode , with the respective orbital angular momenta , spins , and thresholds .",
    ".ho eigenvalues ( [ ho ] ) in gev , for @xmath34 mev , @xmath35 mev , @xmath39 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     having the exact @xmath40-matrix at our disposal , we can easily compute observables , too , like cross sections and phase shifts . although this is not of great importance here , in view of the rather tentative pole positions above 2  gev , we show in fig .",
    "[ traj2cross3 ] , right - hand plot , the @xmath1-wave @xmath41 cross section , just as an illustration . the pole at @xmath42  gev is clearly visible here , in contrast with the @xmath38 channel .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath43 states turns out to significantly improve the description , both for the pole positions and for the @xmath38 cross section @xcite , in line with experiment .",
    "we have shown that coupling a spectrum of confined @xmath18 states to all @xmath1-wave and @xmath0-wave two - meson channels composed of light mesons allows to generate dynamical resonances above 2  gev , besides roughly reproducing the mass and the width of the @xmath44 .",
    "this may provide a framework to understand the puzzling @xmath3 meson , owing to the large and non - linear coupled - channel effects , especially from the @xmath1-wave channels .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath43 @xmath18 states will then account for a more realistic modelling , as confirmed by preliminary results @xcite .",
    "further improvements may be considered as well , such as deviations from ideal mixing , smearing out resonances in the final state , and more general transition potentials .",
    "we thank the organisers for an inspiring and pleasant workshop .",
