    "very few are totally geodesic : in fact by duality between compact and non - compact symmetric spaces , the _ totally geodesic",
    "_ equivariant maps between compact spaces correspond to those between non - compact spaces , which are quite rare ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the hermitian symmetric spaces are open subspaces of their compact duals    generalized grassmanians .",
    "an equivariant holomorphic embedding will generally be given by a natural holomorphic map between the compact duals .",

    "another strong motivation for the theorem is given by mok s rigidity results .",
    "assume for simplicity that @xmath11 is irreducible over @xmath14 and @xmath31 ( this is the _ real _ rank ) .",

    "one may , however , pose the following :    if @xmath2 be semisimple groups over @xmath14 and @xmath6 a homomorphism defined over @xmath46 , does there exist a totally real field @xmath37 and @xmath47 such that @xmath48 is @xmath36-conjugate to @xmath10 at each real prime of @xmath37 ?    finally , mok has informed us that he could prove the theorem even for exceptional @xmath12 .",
