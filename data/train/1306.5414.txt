    "the perovskite oxide la@xmath0sr@xmath6mno@xmath7 ( lsmo ) is a prototype of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effects in the family of mn oxides @xmath8mno@xmath7 or @xmath9mn@xmath10o@xmath11 ( @xmath12=rare earths , @xmath13=alkaline earths ) and thus have been intensively studied for over two decades.@xcite the remarkable phenomenon cmr , characteristic of lsmo , is directly connected with its unique electronic structure , namely the double exchange ( de ) mechanism.@xcite however , it is also well - known that de alone can not explain _ colossal _",
    "mr effects@xcite though the missing components are still under debate .",
    "hence , further electronic - structure studies are required for a complete understanding of the cmr effects as well as further development of magnetoresistive materials in device applications .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy is one of the most direct probes that can be used to investigate the electronic structure of materials .",
    "a recent remarkable discovery in this field is the  metallic \" peak / shoulder ( hereafter shoulder , for simplicity ) in the mn 2@xmath4 core - level spectra of lsmo thin films ( @xmath14 ) measured by hard x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( hx - pes).@xcite this shoulder structure is interpreted as the well - screened peak of the mn@xmath5 state and its intensity is considered to represent the metallicity of the system.@xcite the shoulder intensity was even found to scale the conductivity in la@xmath15ba@xmath16mno@xmath2 thin films.@xcite however , the full @xmath3 dependence of the shoulder intensity and its relation to electrical conductivity was not resolved .",
    "recently , hishida _ _ et al.__@xcite found that this shoulder is observable using laboratory x - ray photoemission ( xps ) using an al @xmath17 x - ray source .",
    "they investigated the shoulder structure in the full range of @xmath3 and found that the @xmath3-dependence of the shoulder intensity did not follow the @xmath3-dependence of the electrical conductivity .",
    "this is because the shoulder due to the mn@xmath5 state loses its weight in a larger @xmath3 , while the electrical conductivity does not drop in proportion to @xmath3.@xcite employing a new multiple - peak fitting strategy , they extracted a mn@xmath18 well - screened peak hidden behind the mn@xmath5 main peak and found that the electrical conductivity was represented by the sum of the spectral weight of both the mn@xmath5 and mn@xmath18 well - screened states .",
    "however , the multiple - peak fitting for a large @xmath3 was not perfect because of the very small mn@xmath5 well - screened shoulder .",
    "hence a further investigation was still needed .",
    "one may expect that the electronic states responsible for electrical conductivity are completely reflected in the quasiparticle spectral weight in the vicinity of the fermi level ( @xmath19 ) . however , this is not always true , particularly in strongly correlated electron systems like lsmo .",
    "although the low - temperature electrical conductivity for lsmo is as high as about @xmath20 ( @xmath21 cm)@xmath22 at @xmath23,@xcite angle - integrated photoemission studies have failed to observe large near-@xmath24 spectral weight@xcite as can be seen in ti or v oxides.@xcite instead , only a few angle - resolved studies on layered manganites have succeeded in observing an extremely small quasiparticle peak in very limited @xmath25-space areas.@xcite nevertheless , the temperature dependence of the near-@xmath24 spectral weight over hundreds mev was found to follow that of the drude weight or electrical conductivity,@xcite reproducing the agreement between the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle peak weight ( with the width of @xmath2650 mev ) and that of the electrical conductivity.@xcite again , there have been no @xmath3-dependent studies on this issue so far .    in this research",

    "the systematic decrease in intensity and shift in energy of the shoulder s undoubtedly confirms that this feature corresponds to the mn@xmath5 well - screened state .",
    "this shoulder is too small to observe in the xps spectrum of @xmath37 , and can be identified only by multiple - peak fitting.@xcite    the @xmath3-dependence of the electrical conductivity at the room temperature ( shown in fig .",

    "this confirms our recent conclusion that this shoulder alone does not represent the metallic conductivity , but the sum of the spectral weight of the both mn@xmath5 and mn@xmath18 well - screened states does.@xcite this fact was not found so far because all previous studies were performed in the lower @xmath3-range .    ) by hx - pes and xps .",

    "the entire o @xmath42 band width increases with @xmath3 , probably because the gdfeo@xmath2-type distortion is reduced with @xmath3.@xcite enlarged views of these hx - pes and xps spectra in a near-@xmath19 region are shown in figs .",

    ", hx - pes has the benefits of a deeper probing depth and larger signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio than xps , while the smaller @xmath44-cross section and the competitive accessibility to hx - pes facilities balances out these benefits . for this reason , we track the @xmath19 spectral weight of xps for the full range of @xmath3 .",

    "this deviation from the systematics up to @xmath37 is probably due to a structural phase transition.@xcite however , the deviation does not affect the near-@xmath19 electronic structure or electrical conductivity because the @xmath45 band fades away towards @xmath48 .    within the rigid - band picture ,",
    "the systematic energy shift ( particularly of a ) can be interpreted as a modulation of the @xmath19 spectral weight ( namely , the density of states at @xmath19 , @xmath49 ) with @xmath3 .",
    "this is because small energy shift @xmath50 due to a small amount of hole doping @xmath51 can be described as @xmath52 , hence giving the shift ratio @xmath53 proportional to @xmath54.@xcite this simple interpretation indeed qualitatively explains the linked behavior of the @xmath19 spectral weight and the energy shift shown in fig .",

    "[ ec ] . nonetheless , the global evolution of the whole @xmath45 spectral weight never follows the rigid band behavior as already pointed out in the literature;@xcite changing its line shape , the spectral weight decreases almost linearly from @xmath36 to 1.0 as seen in fig .",
    "[ vbxps](b ) .",
    "spectral weight of xps ( red diamonds ) and electrical conductivity at the room temperature ( blue triangles ) .",

    "[ vbxps](b ) is plotted against @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ ec ] together with the electrical conductivity .",
    "the spectral weight at @xmath19 was estimated by the integrated intensity in the window slightly larger than the experimental energy resolution centered at @xmath19 , @xmath55 mev .",
    "we see that the plotted @xmath19 weight qualitatively or even semi - quantitatively reproduces the electrical conductivity variation with @xmath3 .",
    "the spectral weight from the hx - pes measurement is also shown for comparison , which shows improved agreement with the conductivity .",
    "this difference is probably caused by a combination of larger surface sensitivity of xps than hx - pes and reduced ferromagnetism and metallicity at the surface.@xcite    the observed qualitative agreement between the @xmath19 weight and the conductivity is rather surprising because the integration window ( 650 mev ) is much larger than the reported quasiparticle line width ( @xmath2650 mev),@xcite and we should not be able to track the @xmath3-dependent change of the quasiparticle spectral weight .",
    "this situation reminds us of the case of the layered manganites , namely , the temperature - dependence of the near-@xmath19 incoherent spectral weight ( spreading over hundreds of mev below the quasiparticle ) which mirrors that of electrical conductivity@xcite and the quasiparticle spectral weight.@xcite in the layered manganites , the near-@xmath19 incoherent spectral weight is transferred to higher binding energy with increasing temperature , which causes the above agreement . the same type of spectral - weight transfer with @xmath3 modulation can be expected in the present three - dimensional system , as observed in la@xmath0sr@xmath1tio@xmath2.@xcite as a result , the xps near-@xmath19 spectral weight integrated over a few hundreds mev can be a rough measure of the total quasiparticle spectral weight in spite of a limited energy resolution of xps .",
    "we have performed x - ray and hard - x - ray photoemission spectroscopy study on the magnetoresistive oxide la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 in order to determine a relation between the valence / core - level photoemission spectral weight and the electrical conductivity as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we observed a small mn@xmath5 well - screened final state for the @xmath37 sample for the first time , which confirms this well - screened state alone can not be a measure of metallicity.@xcite we found that the near-@xmath24 xps spectral weight can be a measure of the variation of electrical conductivity with @xmath3 in spite of a much lower energy resolution compared with the energy scale of the quasiparticle peak .",
    "this is because the change of the quasiparticle spectral weight and the spectral weight transfer of the incoherent part appear concurrently .",
