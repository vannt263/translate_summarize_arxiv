    "neutrino is one of the most interesting elementary particle that plays an important role in understanding nuclear as well as particle physics",
    ". many properties of this particle have already been measured experimentally , still some of them are yet to be measured .",
    "unknown quantities include mass heirarchy , cp violation phase , nature of neutrinos ( whether majorana or not ) , exact mass of neutrinos , whether neutrinos contribute to dark matter etc .",
    "many experiments are ongoing / planned all over the world to measure these quantities . in any neutrino oscillation experiment ,",
    "the neutrino is allowed to scatter off a nucleon / nucleus , and hence precise knowledge of neutrino - nucleon interaction cross section is required to do any analysis .",
    "this interaction cross section plays a vital role in different neutrino oscillation experiments at different stages of calculation .",
    "neutrino interactions across various energy scales can be described below @xcite : + ( a ) thresholdless process ( @xmath0 @xmath1 mev ) + when neutrino has zero momentum , such processes occur which include coherent scattering and neutrino capture on radioactive nuclei ( enhanced or stimulated beta decay emission ) .",
    "+ ( b ) low energy nuclear process ( @xmath0 @xmath2 mev ) + at such energy scale it is possible to probe the target nucleus at smallest length scales .",
    "+ ( c ) intermediate energy process ( @xmath3 gev ) + neutrino - nucleon scattering processes becomes complicated at such energy scale which can be classified mainly as elastic and quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering .",
    "in such scattering processes neutrino scatters off an entire nucleon giving rise to a nucleon or multiple nucleons from the target nucleus . charged current neutrino scattering process",
    "is referred to as ` quasi - elastic scattering ' whereas neutral current scattering is known as ` elastic scattering ' .",
    "+ ( d ) high energy cross sections ( @xmath4 gev ) + neutrino can resolve the individual quark constituents of the nucleon at such energy scale and this type of scattering is called deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) process .",
    "+ ( e ) ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrino scattering ( @xmath5 tev @xmath6 eev ) + the latest highest energy neutrino recorded so far is @xmath7 ev which provide an opportunity for researchers to work with uhe neutrinos from astrophysical sources @xcite .",
    "some of the ongoing / planned experiments for observation of uhe neutrinos from astrophysical sources are baikal @xcite , anita @xcite , rice @xcite , amanda @xcite , hires @xcite , antares @xcite , icecube @xcite etc .",
    "in dis , the neutrino scatters off a quark in the nucleon via the exchange of a virtual w or z boson producing a lepton and a hadronic system in the final state @xcite .",
    "both charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) processes are possible like @xmath8 + x and @xmath9 + the feynman diagram for the process @xmath10 @xmath11 is shown in figure 1(a ) and in the quark - parton model with elementary @xmath12 transition is shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "the qcd improved proton structure function @xcite can be written as @xmath13\\ ] ] + where @xmath14 is the fraction of proton s momentum carried by any of its partons , @xmath15 is the quark structure function inside the proton , @xmath16 is the bjorken variable , @xmath17 is the transverse momentum square of exchanged gauge boson and @xmath18 is the splitting function which represents the probability of a quark emitting a gluon and becoming a quark with momentum reduced by a fraction @xmath19 ( where @xmath19 = @xmath20 ) . in qcd ,",
    "the @xmath21 structure function is a function of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the variation with @xmath17 being only logarithmic .",
    "the evolution of quark density function @xmath22 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be expressed as altarelli - parisi ( ap ) equation .",
    "@xmath23      in neutrino - nucleon scattering , for the range of neutrino energies @xmath24 the value of @xmath16 lies in the range @xmath25 .",
    "the total charged current cross - sections for neutrino - nucleon scattering @xcite can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the neutrino - nucleon structure function , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mandelstam variable which is the total energy in the centre of mass frame , @xmath30 is the nucleon mass , @xmath31 is the fermi constant and @xmath32 is the squared mass of intermediate w - boson .",
    "similar expression can be obtained for neutral current cross section . for the flavor - symmetric ( @xmath33)n interaction at @xmath34 , the neutrino - nucleon structure function ,",
    "@xmath35 can be related to electromagnetic structure function , @xmath36 @xcite as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of flavors and @xmath39 is the quark charge .",
    "the neutrino - nucleon scattering process involves scattering of neutrino off quarks as shown in figure 1(b ) .",
    "thus , the knowledge of proton structure function can be utilised in calculation of neutrino - proton scattering cross - section .",
    "this idea has been utilised in the present work . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the behaviour of @xmath40 in dal ( double asymptotic limit ) which in turn would be used to calculate neutrino - nucleon scattering cross - section in uhe regime .",
    "in ( @xmath41 ) dis , in the next to leading order , scaling violations occur through gluon bremsstrahlung from quarks and quark pair creation from gluons . at small @xmath42",
    ", the latter process dominates the scaling violations .",
    "this property can be exploited to extract gluon density from the slope @xmath43 of the proton structure function .",
    "the general equations @xcite describing the @xmath17 evolution of the quark density and gluon density respectively are @xmath44\\ ] ] @xmath45\\ ] ] where @xmath46 are the splitting functions and @xmath47 .",
    "assuming that the quark densities are negligible and the non - singlet contribution @xmath48 can be ignored safely at small @xmath16 in ap equation , for @xmath21 , the equation becomes @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the gluon momentum density and @xmath51 is the gluon number density of the proton and @xmath52 .",
    "rearranging equation ( 7 ) we have @xmath53\\ ] ] substituting @xmath54 we can write rhs of equation ( 8) as @xmath55\\ ] ] expanding @xmath56 about @xmath57 and keeping terms upto the first derivative of g in the expansion we have    @xmath58    when this expansion is used in equation ( 8) we get @xmath59 where @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 $ ] , and @xmath62 $ ] . + in the limit @xmath63 equation ( 11 ) reduces to @xmath64 using the above , double asymptotic expression @xcite for @xmath21 in small @xmath16 and large @xmath17 ( dal ) limit , we can write @xmath65 with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath38 is the number of flavors , @xmath68 is the value at which the input parton parameterization is to be used and @xmath69 is the qcd mass scale . @xmath40 in equation ( 13 ) in dal can be parametrized as @xmath70 this behaviour of @xmath40 , when used in equation ( 3 ) gives @xmath71 where @xmath72 and the values of constants are found to be as @xmath73 and @xmath74 from equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) it can be seen that @xmath75 @xmath76 in low @xmath16 and high @xmath17 regime .",
    "here a is normalisation constant . + further analysis is in progress @xcite .",
    "to summarize , in this work we have utilized the dal behaviour of proton structure function in calculating the neutrino scattering cross section ( see equation ( 16 ) ) .",
    "as dal is applicable in low - @xmath16 and high @xmath17 regime we expect that this behaviour could be applicable for explaining uhe neutrino scattering cross section in this regime",
