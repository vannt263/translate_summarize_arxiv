    "entanglement is a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon that is a crucial resource for quantum information processing .",
    "it has been widely used in quantum communication and quantum computation protocols over the past decades @xcite .",
    "entangled photon systems can serve as a quantum channel in many long - distance quantum communication schemes such as quantum key distribution @xcite , dense coding @xcite , teleportation @xcite , quantum secret sharing @xcite , and quantum secure direct communication @xcite .",
    "single photons are interesting candidates for quantum communication due to their manipulability and high - speed transmission , and because they have several degrees of freedom ( dofs ) to carry quantum information .",
    "this also allows the possibility of entanglement in a single or multiple degrees of freedom .",
    "so far , photons entangled in polarization , spatial modes , time - bin , frequency , and orbital angular momentum have all been successfully generated in experiments .",
    "moreover , hyperentanglement in which photons are simultaneously entangled in more than one dof has also been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "hyperentangled states can be used to beat the channel capacity limit of superdense coding with linear optics @xcite , construct hyper - parallel photonic quantum computing @xcite which can reduces the operation time and the resources consumed in quantum information processing , achieve the high - capacity quantum communication with the complete teleportation and entanglement swapping in two dofs @xcite . they can also help to design deterministic entanglement purification protocols @xcite which work in a deterministic way , not a probabilistic one , far different from conventional entanglement purification protocols @xcite .",
    "they have been used to assist the complete bell - state analysis @xcite .",
    "however , entangled states will inevitably interact with the environment during transmission and storage .",
    "this degrades the fidelity and entanglement of the quantum states , which subsequently reduces the fidelity and security of quantum communication schemes .",
    "one solution proposed to preserve the fidelity of entangled channels is entanglement concentration .",
    "this method can be used to distill maximally entangled states from an ensemble of less - entangled pure states  @xcite .",
    "many interesting entanglement concentration schemes considering different physical systems , different entangled states and exploiting different components have been proposed and discussed @xcite .",
    "recently , the distillation of hyperentangled states has attracted much attention since hyperentanglement has increasing applications in quantum information processing . in 2013 ,",
    "ren , du , and deng @xcite presented the parameter - splitting method , a very efficient way for entanglement concentration with linear optics , and they gave the first hyperentanglement concentration protocol for two - photon four - qubit systems , which was extended to multipartite entanglement subsequently @xcite .",

    "we focus on hyperentanglement concentrations of states entangled in the polarization and time - bin degrees of freedom .",

    "the time - bin dof is also a simple , conventional classical dof .",
    "two different times of arrival can be used to encode the logical 0 and 1 .",
    "the time - bin states can be simply discriminated by the time of arrival . on the other hand ,",
    "the manipulation of the time - bin dof is not easy .",
    "the hadamard operation and measurement of the time - bin state in the diagonal basis @xmath1 are difficult .    in this paper",
    "we show how to manipulate the time - bin and polarization dofs for hyperconcentration of two - photon entanglement .",
    "our first scheme uses two less - entangled pairs with unknown parameters to concentrate hyperentanglement via the schmidt projection method .",
    "the second scheme we propose , which only uses one copy of the less - entangled state with known parameters , borrows some ideas from the parameters splitting method @xcite .",
    "both these two schemes can be generalized to concentrate @xmath0-photon hyperentangled ghz states , and the success probability remains unchanged with the growth of the number of photons .",
    "moreover , our schemes do not require nonlinear interactions that are difficult to implement with current technology .",
    "the time - bin entanglement is a stable and useful dof @xcite and does not require two paths per photon compared with the spatial modes .",

    "<S> the first scheme distills a maximally hyperentangled state from two identical less - entangled states with unknown parameters via the schmidt projection method . </S>",
    "<S> the other scheme can be used to concentrate an initial state with known parameters , and requires only one copy of the initial state for the concentration process . </S>",

    "<S> the spatial mode degree of freedom can provide savings in quantum resources , which makes our schemes practical and useful for long - distance quantum communication . </S>"
