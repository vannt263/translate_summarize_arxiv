    "in order to describe fully the dynamics of molecules and atoms subject to an external laser field , one must in principle solve the time dependent schrdinger equation including all degrees of freedom .",

    "compared with the adk model , the sfa is more suited for obtaining angular and energy resolved spectra .",
    "the two models are in fact connected since the tunneling rate can be obtained from the sfa in the low frequency limit  @xcite . the initial work by keldysh  @xcite concerned ionization of hydrogen .",
    "the model was further developed by faisal and reiss  @xcite and is commonly known as the keldysh - faisal - reiss ( kfr ) model . later on ,",

    "multicentric molecular wave functions contain many different angular momenta and correspondingly we see small inaccuracies when we use the saddle point method for molecules .",
    "in contrast to previous reports on saddle point methods in the velocity gauge sfa  @xcite , we did not find a critical lowest intensity below which the saddle point method fails . even though we find small errors",
    "which are direct consequences of using the saddle point method instead of a numerical evaluation of the transition amplitude , the error is nearly constant for a wide range of intensities and is small compared to the large variations in the absolute rates .",
    "furthermore , we should keep in mind that the sfa itself is only the leading order of an _",
    "s_-matrix series .",
    "the small error in the saddle point evaluation may therefore turn out to be insignificant compared to , e.g. , neglecting the coulomb interaction in the final state  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the saddle point method in the present two - term version can be used with advantage for long wavelengths and high intensities when many photon absorptions lead to ionization . in this case , the transition amplitude is difficult to evaluate numerically since the integrand oscillates rapidly .",
    "the sfa also applies to non - monochromatic fields , e.g. , a few cycle pulse .",
    "the transition amplitude is then calculated by an integral over the full duration of the pulse .",
    "numerical integration by standard gaussian quadrature requires thousands of function evaluations to obtain convergence  @xcite .",
    "it would clearly be desirable to extend the saddle point method to such a situation where we need just a few saddle point evaluations .",
