    "in the last two decades several quantum - enhanced communication protocols and measurement schemes have been suggested and demonstrated .",
    "the effective implementation of these schemes crucially relies on the generation and characterization of nonclassical states and operations ( including measurements ) , which represent the two pillars of quantum technology . the assessment of quantum resources amounts to make quantitative statements about the similarity of a quantum state to a target one , or to measure the effectiveness of a reconstruction technique . for these purposes one needs a figure of merit to compare quantum states . among the possible distance - like quantities that can be defined in the hilbert space a widely adopted measure of closeness of two quantum states",

    ", this implies that the two states are very close in the hilbert space , as it follows from the above relations between the fidelity and the bures and trace distances . on the other hand , neighboring states may not share nearly identical physical properties @xcite as one may be tempted to conclude .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show , on the basis of several examples for qubits and continuous variable ( cv ) systems , that very high values of fidelity may be achieved by pairs of states with considerably different physical properties , including separable and entangled states or classical and nonclassical ones .",
    "furthermore , we provide a quantitative analysis of this discrepancy .    in order to illustrate the point",

    "indeed , our examples show that high values of fidelity may be achieved by pairs of states with considerably different physical properties , e.g. states containing quantum resources and states of no value for quantum technology .",
    "our examples are thus especially relevant for certification of quantumness in the presence of noise .",

    "we address two - qubit systems , focusing on both entanglement and discord of nearby pauli diagonal states .",
