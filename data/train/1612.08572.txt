    "<S> our main result shows that the family @xmath5 approximates the brownian half - planes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , recently introduced in  @xcite . for @xmath8 , we give a description of the @xmath0 in terms of a looptree associated to a critical two - type galton - watson tree conditioned to survive .    </S>",
