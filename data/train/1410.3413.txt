    "qcd under extreme conditions has been a subject of the intense study for the last decade .",
    "a large body of experimental data on heavy - ion collisions obtained at rhic and lhc has lead to a revolutionary change in our view on the properties of qcd matter at finite temperature and density .",
    "these properties depend on the location of the system in the qcd phase diagram , i.e. , on the values of the temperature and the chemical potential . roughly speaking , information obtained at rhic and lhc",
    "corresponds to the high temperature and low density region .",
    "our focus in the present paper is on the opposite regime of high density and moderate temperature .",
    "such conditions may be realized in neutron stars and in future experiments at nica and fair . on the theoretical side",
    "we understand much better what happens to quark - gluon matter at high @xmath1 and zero , or small @xmath2 , than in the reverse situation . to a great extent",
    "this is due to the fact that zero @xmath2 and high @xmath1 region is accessible to monte - carlo simulations . according to the present understanding of the phase structure of the qcd matter attractive interaction between quarks in color antitriplet state leads at high density to the formation of the color superconducting phase @xcite",
    ". some important features of this phase are , however , very different from that of a standard bcs superconductor @xcite .",
    "what is important for us here is that instead of an almost sharp dividing line between the normal and superconducting phases in the bcs case , in color superconductor the transition is significantly smeared and the effect of the precritical fluctuations is important . from the analysis below we infer the conclusion that fluctuation conductivity(or paraconductivity )",
    "@xcite is large and exceeds the drude(or boltzmann ) one .",
    "another question we address is the dependence of the ec on the magnetic field(mf ) .",
    "the outbreak of the interest to the behaviour of quark matter in strong mf is caused by the fact that mf of the order of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is created(for a short time ) in peripheral heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc @xcite .",
    "the field of about 4 orders of magnitude less exists on the surface of magnetars , and may be of the order of @xmath5 in its interior @xcite .",
    "a powerful way to investigate the nature of a certain substance is to study its response to the external perturbation , to the mf in our case .",
    "below we show that due to a large value of the chemical potential in dense quark matter ec does not exhibit a drastic suppression with mf increasing .",
    "such a behaviour is at odds with the typical behaviour of the drude ec in condensed matter .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we evaluate the drude ec using the diagrammatic approach .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] develops the boltzmann equation for the ec .",
    "here we show that drude ec does not feel the influence of the mf until it reaches a huge value of about @xmath6 . in section [ sec:4 ]",
    "we turn to the quantum contribution to the ec .",
    "we outline the general picture of the fluctuation phenomena in the precritical region .",
    "then we introduce the fluctuation propagator and go on to compute the aslamazov - larkin paraconductivity .",
    "our results are summarized in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "numerical estimates are presented here and the problems to be solved along the same lines are formulated .",
    "as a starting point we consider a diagrammatic derivation of the drude ec of dense quark matter . the drude ec can be derived from the kubo two - point current - current correlator @xcite .",
    "the corresponding diagram is shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "one has    @xmath7        with u- and d - quarks included the electric charge is @xmath8 = 0.051\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] matsubara propagators entering in ( [ eq:1 ] ) have the form @xmath9 here @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath2 is the chemical potential , @xmath13 is the momentum relaxation , or transport relaxation time . from the formal point of view @xmath13 regulates the pinch(collinear ) singularities of([eq:1 ] ) coming from the multiplication of the two propagators with momenta @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the limit @xmath16 , @xmath17 . from the physical point of view @xmath13",
    "reflects the fact that quarks do not propagate through dense thermal medium without collisions .",
    "the loop diagram shown in fig.[fig:1 ] at finite @xmath1 and @xmath2 has been calculated in a number of papers , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we want to present the steps and assumptions which are distinctive for the physical situation of high density and moderate temperature . in order to calculate expression ( [ eq:1 ] ) we make use of the following conditions / assumptions : @xmath18 @xmath19 relation ( [ eq:4 ] ) is easily recognized as hard thermal loop approximation htl @xcite .",
    "indeed , the external momentum @xmath20 is assumed to be soft , but the internal momentum @xmath21 is hard .",
    "however , in our case this is not due to the high temperature as in standard htl , but due to the fact that the dominant contribution to the integral in ( [ eq:1 ] ) comes from the vicinity of the fermi surface with high @xmath2 . keeping in mind the above difference between the high temperature and high density regimes , we can follow the derivation presented in @xcite and obtain @xmath22 velocity @xmath23 entering in ( [ eq:6 ] ) is the relativistic quark velocity near the fermi surface @xmath24 in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is the density of states near the fermi surface . under the condition",
    "@xmath27 it reads @xmath28\\ ] ] terms of the order @xmath29 and higher are omitted @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare @xmath26 given by ( [ eq:7 ] ) with the thermal asymptotic mass @xcite @xmath30 next we perform the calculation of the integral ( [ eq:6 ] )",
    ". exact calculation of ( [ eq:6 ] ) yields @xmath31 this general expression is most adequate for the ballistic regime when @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "dense quark matter near the transition line is a highly disordered medium , the quark mean free path does not exceed 1 fm(see below ) . we shall therefore obtain from ( [ eq:6 ] ) an approximate expression relevant for the `` dirty '' regime @xmath34 , @xmath35 . expanding the integrand in ( [ eq:6 ] ) over these two parameters and integrating , we get @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "this is a classical expression for drude ec in the diffusion regime .    at this point",
    "let us remind the assumptions behind this result and indicate the imprints of the high density regime .",
    "the polarization operator in ( [ eq:1 ] ) has been calculated under the assumption of a soft external momentum @xmath20 and a hard internal one @xmath21 .",
    "physically this is tantamount to the proximity of @xmath21 to the fermi surface .",
    "the above approximation can be called the hard density loop in analogy with htl .",
    "another approximation is the expansion over @xmath39 in the expression ( [ eq:7 ] ) for the density of states",
    ". finally we note that our result ( [ eq:10 ] ) differs from the nonrelativistic one only kinematically , namely in ( [ eq:10 ] ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 instead of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "the next task is to investigate the influence of mf on ec",
    ". we shall be interested in the role played by the high density .",
    "the problem can be investigated either diagrammatically , or using the boltzmann kinetic equation .",
    "we shall use the second approach which is technically simpler .",
    "the boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation reads @xcite @xmath44 here @xmath13 is the relaxation time , @xmath45 is the distribution function in the equilibrium @xmath46 + 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 . equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) is written under the assumption of small inhomogeneity in space and time(i.e . , we shall evaluate ec at @xmath48 ) . for simplicity",
    "we consider the equation for the quark distribution neglecting antiquarks . at high density",
    "this is a trustworthy approximation which can be easily lifted @xcite .",
    "the solution of the kinetic equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) and the derivation of ec are described in textbooks @xcite .",
    "our attention will be focused on the points reflecting the regime of high density and moderate temperature .",
    "it will be shown that the role of the mass of the electric charge carrier will be taken by the chemical potential @xmath2 , and since @xmath49 the damping of ec by mf is drastically reduced .",
    "following @xcite we work in the linear in @xmath50 approximation and substitute @xmath51 by @xmath45 in the term proportional to @xmath50 in ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "the distribution @xmath45 is isotropic , therefore @xmath52 where @xmath53 in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "this is where @xmath2 comes into play .",
    "then ( [ eq:11 ] ) takes form @xmath54 the solution of ( [ eq:14 ] ) is parametrized as @xmath55 this ansatz ( [ eq:14 ] ) transforms into @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",

    "momentum integration yields @xmath60 + ...",
    "\\right\\}\\\\    \\nonumber    =   \\nu\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression for the density of states was already introduced in ( [ eq:7 ] ) .",
    "finally we obtain the ec tensor(constant mf is directed along the z - axis ) @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 is drude ec given by ( [ eq:10 ] ) at @xmath65 . in line with symmetry requirements",
    "ec along mf remains unchanged @xcite .",
    "summarizing , we point out the distinctions between the above results and the standard ones @xcite .",
    "the density of states ( [ eq:19 ] ) corresponds to relativistic kinematics and the condition @xmath66 .",
    "the damping of ec by mf due to factor the @xmath67 is for @xmath49 much slower than by a similar factor with @xmath68 in the usual case .",
    "next we turn to the quantum contribution to ec . in superconductors such phenomena",
    "have been intensively studied for more than three decades @xcite .",
    "precritical phenomena in quark matter and fluctuation conductivity(fc ) , or paraconductivity , have been discussed in @xcite without deriving explicit equations .",
    "first we want to point out an important difference between fluctuating phenomena in superconductors @xcite and in high density quark matter @xcite .",
    "attraction between electrons in a superconductor is due to the interaction with the lattice(phonon mechanism ) .",
    "the characteristic energy scale of this interaction is the debye frequency @xmath69 , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the electron and ion masses . on the other hand , the typical fermi energy is @xmath72 .",
    "thus @xmath73 and the interaction in the bcs regime is concentrated within a very thin layer around the fermi surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of @xmath74 in color superconductor is played by the momentum cutoff @xmath75 @xcite while in high density and moderate temperature regime @xmath76 .",
    "thus the scale hierarchy is opposite to that in bcs .",
    "another difference concerns the size of pairs forming the condensate . in bcs",
    "this is the coherence length @xmath77 which is macroscopic , i.e. , much larger than the interatomic distance @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the bcs dimensionless parameter is @xmath80 . in color superconductor",
    "the same quantity is @xmath81 @xcite , where @xmath77 is the size of the diquark pair , @xmath82 .",
    "the fluctuation contribution to the physical quantities is characterized by ginzburg - levanyuk number @xmath83 which for the quark matter may be estimated as @xmath84 we remind that for the bcs superconductor @xmath85 .",
    "two conclusions may be drawn from the above considerations .",
    "fluctuation region in quark matter is much wider than in bcs superconductors .",
    "quantum contribution to ec may be substantial contrary to the situation in solid state physics where it is called `` quantum correction '' .",
    "the theoretical study of fluctuation conductivity dates from the seminal paper @xcite and since then the subject has been intensively studied in the framework of both conventional and high - temperature superconductivity theories @xcite . in strong coupling regime paraconductivity",
    "has been discussed in @xcite .    at",
    "temperature higher than @xmath86 quark pairing is energetically unfavourable .",
    "as soon as the temperature approaches @xmath86 from above the number of fluctuation quark pairs increases .",
    "such pairs are described by the fluctuation propagator(fp ) @xcite represented by the feynman diagram in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "analytically dyson equation for the fp @xmath87 reads @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the coupling constant with dimension @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the polarization operator . if for a moment we ignore that quarks undergo chaotic scattering , the polarization operator would have the form    @xmath92    note the sign difference between the arguments of the green s functions in ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:25 ] ) and opposite directions of the corresponding arrow in figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .",
    "this is because the fp corresponds to the cooper channel . in the vicinity of @xmath86 fluctuations",
    "are dominated by long - wave modes .",
    "therefore @xmath93 can be expanded as @xcite @xmath94 calculation of @xmath95 and @xmath96 is straightforward and were presented in @xcite .",
    "one has @xmath97\\ ] ] here @xmath98 is the relativistic density of states at the fermi level .",
    "as we shall see below , the first term in ( [ eq:26]-[eq:27 ] ) gives after summation over @xmath99 the cooper logarithm and the second one corresponds to the long - wave fluctuations .    at the next step",
    "we have to include the random scattering and the corresponding momentum relaxation time parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the averaging of the green s functions over the disorder amounts to the replacement of @xmath99 in @xmath93 by @xmath11 .",
    "the averaging procedure includes also the renormalization of the vertex function which is represented graphically in fig.[fig:3 ] .        as a result",
    "the polarization operator takes the form @xmath100 here @xmath101 is a potential responsible for the quark momentum relaxation .",
    "if we adopt the standard assumption that it satisfies the gauss law , then after the averaging over the volume we have @xmath102 @xcite . equation ( [ eq:28 ] ) may be formulated in terms of the vertex renormalization correction @xmath103 as @xmath104 @xmath105 in particular , at @xmath106 , @xmath17 from ( [ eq:27 ] ) we obtain @xmath107    performing the summation over @xmath99 in ( [ eq:28 ] ) we obtain @xmath108\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath109 is the logarithmic derivative of the @xmath110-function , @xmath111 is the high - frequency cut - off , @xmath112 , @xmath113 is the diffusion coefficient which can be formally introduced by the equation @xmath114 @xmath115 in the limiting cases ( [ eq:30]-[eq:31 ] ) yield    @xmath116    as we shall discuss below , the quark matter in the precritical regime corresponds to @xmath117 . assuming that @xmath118 we expand the second term in ( [ eq:29 ] ) and then replace @xmath111 by the critical temperature using the thouless condition @xmath119 here @xmath120 .",
    "finally we can write the following expression for the fp ( [ eq:24 ] ) ( @xmath37 ) @xmath121 two remarks are appropriate at this point .",
    "first , the only difference of the fp ( [ eq:34 ] ) from its nonrelativistic counterpart @xcite amounts to a replacement of the nonrelativistic density of states by the relativistic one @xmath122 .",
    "second , as it was shown in @xcite , the derivation of the fp in the strong coupling regime does not alter the final result ( [ eq:34 ] ) .    with the fp at our disposal we can evaluate the aslamazov - larkin(al ) ( paraconductivity ) contribution to ec in the fluctuation region .",
    "based on the experience gained in condensed matter physics @xcite we assume that it is of major importance among other quantum fluctuation effects .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagram is shown in fig.[fig:4 ]    .,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the ec can be written as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the retarded electromagnetic response operator and for the al contribution it is given by the feynman diagram shown in fig.[fig:4 ] and reads @xcite    @xmath125    where @xmath126 are fp - s , and @xmath127 correspond to the three green s functions blocks @xmath128.\\ ] ]    the propagators entering into ( [ eq:37 ] ) may be decomposed into contributions from quarks and antiquarks @xmath129.\\ ] ] we are considering the high density regime when the system is dopped with excess quarks . at high @xmath2",
    "the antiquark part of the green s function is suppressed by the factor @xmath130 is the denominator and will be dropped .",
    "we plan to investigate the accuracy of this approximation as a function of the @xmath2 in a forthcoming study .",
    "close to the fermi surface the physical quantities depend on the variable @xmath131 .",
    "the high density green s function takes the form @xmath132 in the vicinity of @xmath86 the fp ( [ eq:34 ] ) has a pole structure .",
    "the dependence of @xmath133 and @xmath134 on @xmath135 and @xmath136 is much stronger than the dependence of the green s functions on the same quantities",
    ". we shall keep in the propagators entering into @xmath137 only the dependence on the fermionic frequencies @xmath138 and calculate @xmath139 .",
    "expanding @xmath140 at @xmath106 one has @xmath141 then we have @xmath142 \\simeq \\\\",
    "\\frac{2{\\mathbf{p}}}{\\mu } \\left[\\frac{1}{(\\xi - i \\tilde{\\varepsilon}_n)^2(\\xi + i\\tilde{\\varepsilon}_n ) } + \\frac{({\\mathbf{q}}{\\mathbf{p}})}{\\mu}\\frac{1}{(\\xi^2 + \\tilde{\\varepsilon}_n^2)^2 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] angular integration over @xmath143 kills the first term .",
    "the second term yields @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the quark velocity at the fermi surface .",
    "the vertex corrections were taken in the form ( [ eq:31ins ] ) since the @xmath146-dependence is essential only at @xmath147 . the summation in ( [ eq:45ins ] )",
    "has been performed using ( [ eq:30 ] ) - ( [ eq:32 ] ) .",
    "returning to ( [ eq:36 ] ) , we write @xmath148 to evaluate the sum in ( [ eq:46ins ] ) we can use the technique of replacing the summation by contour integration @xcite . at the first step this leads to the following result for the absolute value of the response operator @xmath149 \\mathrm{im } l^r({\\mathbf{q}},-iz),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath150 , @xmath37 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the retarded and advanced fp - s . the next step is to expand the integrand in powers of @xmath153 and to subtract the zeroth order term which would lead to meissner effect above @xmath86 .",
    "this may be regarded as imposing the ward identity by brute force .",
    "the problem is a subtle one @xcite . to take care to satisfy the ward identity one has to consider the sum of the al and maki - thompson @xcite diagrams",
    "nonetheless , it is almost always to take into account only the al contribution to fit experimental data above the transition in ordinary superconductors and hts compounds @xcite .    keeping in ( [ eq:47ins ] ) the term proportional to @xmath153 and integrating by parts , one has @xmath154 the final result for the conductivity reads @xmath155 where @xmath156",
    "= = = = = = = = = = = = = = + old text + = = = = = = = = = = = = = = + where @xmath126 are fp - s , and @xmath127 correspond to the blocks of the propagators .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath157 reduces to the integration over the internal quasi - cooper pair momentum @xmath146 and the quark momentum @xmath158 and summation over the fermionic @xmath159 and bosonic @xmath135 frequencies .",
    "note that we have put the external momentum equal to zero and the final step we shall take the static limit @xmath17 .",
    "the calculation of the response operator ( [ eq:36 ] - [ eq:37 ] ) is cumbersome @xcite . in the vicinity of @xmath86",
    "the leading role is played by the fp which has been derived above . as in the diagrammatic approach to the drude ec , presented in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", the relativistic calculation differs from the nonrelativistic one @xcite mainly by the kinematic factors .",
    "therefore we refer the interested reader to the lengthy derivation presented in the above references .",
    "the final result reads @xmath160 where @xmath161    where @xmath113 is the diffusion operator equal to @xmath162 in the `` dirty '' limit.(see ( [ eq:32 ] ) ) .",
    "the important point that in the fluctuation region the parameter for the quark system is large @xmath163 the long - wave fluctuation picture which led to the result ( [ eq:50ins ] ) becomes inadequate very close to @xmath86 where different physical mechanisms should be included .",
    "now we have to compare the relative contributions of the drude and al ec and briefly compare our results with the numerious calculations of ec presented in literature .",
    "our first important conclusion is that in the precritical region of high density and moderate temperature the fluctuation ec(paraconductivity ) not only reaches the value of the drude one , but can greatly exceed it . to make this statement clear - cut we combine eqs.([eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:38 ] ) at @xmath164 in the following form @xmath165 where @xmath166 .",
    "as it was already noted , our knowledge of the qcd phase diagram in the high density region is far from being settled @xcite .",
    "the hope is that the future experiments at fair and nica will bring a much more reliable picture .",
    "so far we can take @xmath167 , @xmath168 as a reasonable set of parameters in the precritical region @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath169 , so that @xmath170 , @xmath171 .",
    "the most important parameter is @xmath13 for which to our best knowledge a reliable determination is lacking .",
    "for example , in @xcite it varies within the interval @xmath172 . as an estimate we take @xmath173 .",
    "equation ( [ eq:41])takes the form @xmath174 we see that for @xmath175 paraconductivity dominates over the drude one . in condensed matter physics the situation when paraconductivity becomes equal to the classical one is possibly realized in the two - dimensional samples @xcite .",
    "another conclusion is the stabilization of the drude ec in mf up to the mf values @xmath176 - see eq.([eq:20 ] ) . for our choice of parameters",
    "the corresponding mf value is @xmath177 .",
    "the problem of the paraconductivity dependence on the mf will be the subject of the forthcoming dedicated publication .",
    "finally , let us present for the orientation purposes the values of the drude and al ec for the above set of parameters .",
    "we have @xmath178(see ( [ eq:2 ] ) ) .",
    "then @xmath179 as already mentioned , the ec in this domain of the qcd phase diagram has not been calculated before .",
    "numerous results at @xmath180 and different values of @xmath1 @xcite differ from each other by an order of magnitude . as an example we quote ref.@xcite according to which @xmath181 for @xmath182 and @xmath180 .",
    "we note in passing that our value of @xmath183 is about two orders of magnitude larger than the ec of cu at room temperature , while @xmath184 exceeds it by a factor 5000 .",
    "our study of the ec near the transition line at high density allows to suggest that other transport coefficients - shear viscosity and thermal conductivity will be dominated by the fluctuation effects as well .",
    "another important physical observable which may display a spectacular behaviour in the fluctuation domain is the lepton - pair production rate which is determined by the current - current correlator .",
