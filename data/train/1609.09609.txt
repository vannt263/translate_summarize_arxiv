    "one can reconstruct neutrino mass matrix once all the mixing parameters and three masses are known .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments probe mass squared differences ( @xmath24 ) and all the mixing parameters except majorana phases .",
    "results from neutrino oscillation experiments show two masses are close to each other , while the third mass is comparatively far away than the other two ( @xmath25 is of the order of @xmath26 and @xmath27 is of the order of @xmath28 ) and this results two possible mass hierarchies , either @xmath29 ( normal hierarchy ) or @xmath30 ( inverted hierarchy ) .",
    "there are ongoing neutrino oscillation experiments like no@xmath31a and t2k etc .",
    ", which are expected to resolve mass hierarchy .",
    "beta decay experiments and cosmological bound on sum of neutrino masses ( @xmath32 ) give the absolute scale of neutrino masses while neutrino less double beta decay ( @xmath33 ) experiments can test majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "the tritium beta decay experiment katrin @xcite shows absolute scale of neutrino mass is less than 0.35 ev and cosmological bound on @xmath32 from planck data is 0.23 ev @xcite .",
    "initially neutrino oscillation experiments indicated the atmospheric mixing angle , @xmath20 is maximal i.e. , @xmath34 and reactor mixing angle @xmath0 is vanishingly small and motivated by such anticipation many models for neutrino mixing were proposed such as bimaximal mixing ( bm ) @xcite , tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm ) @xcite , golden ratio type - a ( gra ) , type - b ( grb ) @xcite and hexagonal mixing ( hg ) , etc . all such models are based on some discrete symmetries such as @xmath35 , @xmath36 @xcite etc and can be represented as @xmath37 where @xmath38 takes the values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the golden ratio ) , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for bm , tbm , gra , grb and hg respectively .",
    "recently daya bay @xcite reno @xcite and t2k @xcite experiments measured non - zero reactor mixing angle and hence , the above mentioned symmetry forms ca nt explain the experimental results .",
    "but various studies show that these models can be modified suitably to accommodate the observed mixing angles by adding perturbations @xcite . among above mentioned symmetry forms tbm is of great interest because of its prediction to solar mixing angle , @xmath45 against the experimental best fit value 0.323 and it can be explained on the basis of @xmath35 @xcite symmetry , the smallest non abelian discrete symmetry with three dimensional irreducible representation .",
    "the perturbations can be incorporated in various ways and one possible form for example is the @xmath46 symmetry in neutrino sector and @xmath47 symmetry in charged lepton sector . in this paper",
    ", we study a possible form of perturbation which modifies tbm to make it compatible with the recent experimental results .",
    "we also study the variation of electron neutrino mass ( @xmath8 ) and the 11 element of the majorana neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath48 ) , observables of @xmath49 decay and @xmath33 decay experiments respectively with the lightest neutrino mass in order to verify the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will discuss briefly about the lepton mixing matrix and in section iii we present the perturbation in the neutrino sector and its effect on the observables like mixing angles , @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath48 .",

    "the lepton mixing matrix commonly known as pmns matrix arises from the overlapping of the matrices that diagonalize charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices , hence pmns matrix is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the matrices which diagonalize charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices respectively .",
    "but it is always possible to work in a basis where charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal so that @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "hence , one can write @xmath55 without loss of generality . so here",
    "we consider @xmath53 and @xmath52 as tbm in the leading order , and hence the pmns matrix is given as @xmath56 since tbm predicts @xmath57 , it ca nt accommodate the recent observation of largish @xmath0 by the reactor experiments .",
    "so it has to be modified suitably for being in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that such modifications can come from perturbative corrections due to higher dimensional operators .",
    "we will discuss a possible form of perturbation in next section and show that it can consistently accommodate all the measured mixing angles .",
    "in this section we consider the deviations from tbm mixing angles due to perturbation in the neutrino sector so that the obtained mixing angles satisfy experimental results .",
    "the perturbation is taken as a rotation in 23 plane followed by a rotation in 13 plane .",
    "existence of dirac cp phase is ensured by the complex phase in the 13 rotation matrix .",
    "such a perturbation is quite reasonable , as it will give correction to the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath20 which deviates from its maximal value and large correction to the reactor mixing angle @xmath0 . with this perturbation the lepton mixing matrix",
    "will be of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the tbm mixing matrix given in eqn .",

    "@xcite , tbm mixing is realized based on @xmath35 symmetry which breaks to one of its subgroup @xmath47 in the charged lepton sector while neutrino sector preserves @xmath46 symmetry .",
    "they have shown that charged lepton and neutrino sector form a parallel world of flavour symmetry breaking and both the charged lepton and neutrino sectors receive corrections due to interaction between the sectors after symmetry breaking .",
    "but one can always go to charged lepton mass diagonal basis so that only neutrino sector contributes to lepton mixing .",
