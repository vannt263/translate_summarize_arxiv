    "note that by ( [ eqn : p and a ] ) @xmath4 can be regarded as the _ area _ scale factors . therefore , with the lqc discreteness corrections , ( [ eqn : qm diff eq 2 ] ) shows that the singularities ( both kasner - like and kasner - unlike ) are resolved and replaced by the big bounces in the backward evolution when any of the area scales undergoes the vanishing behavior . across the bounces ,",

    "the planar collapse is _ not _ resolved but one of the length scale factors @xmath7 continues the vanishing behavior in the kasner - like case .",
    "this is expected since the classical solutions ( [ eqn : const ki ] ) and ( [ eqn : cl sol 1 ] ) yield @xmath40 ( and @xmath41 in @xmath1-scheme ) toward the planar collapse and therefore the quantum corrections become more and more negligible ( in both schemes ) .    for given initial conditions ,",

    "the fact that smallness of @xmath4 ( not of @xmath7 ) is an indication of the occurrence of big bounces seems to support the suggestion that `` area is more fundamental than length in lqg '' , although whether this is simply a technical artifact or reflects some deep physics is still not clear .",
    "( see section vii.b of @xcite for some comments on this aspect and @xcite for more details . ) meanwhile , as the length operator has been shown to have a discrete spectrum @xcite , the fact that the vanishing of the length scale factor in the planar collapse is not stopped seems to contradict the discreteness of the length spectrum .",
    "whether we miss some important ingredients when imposing the fundamental discreteness of lqg in the lqc construction or indeed area is more essential than length remains an open question for further investigation .",
    "it is also noteworthy that ( [ eqn : qm diff eq 2 ] ) remains invariant if we rescale @xmath45 and @xmath46 at the same time .",
    "this is reminiscent of the idea as suggested in @xcite that area is measurable only if the surface is _ coupled with the material reference_. the scaling invariance , however , breaks down in the full lqc theory since the quantum evolution is governed by a difference equation @xcite , in which the step size of difference introduces an additional scale in the deep planck regime . and @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , we put big values of @xmath0 and @xmath35 in the figures to make sense of the semiclassical approach for the effective dynamics .",
    "the figures are trivially rescaled under the scaling . ]",
    "meanwhile , related to the above observation , the physical meaning of the directional densities @xmath33 can be interpreted as the ( inverse of ) area scales , again , _ measured by the reference of the matter content_. the big bounces take place whenever one of the area scales becomes very small by the reference of the matter momentum .",
    "it is then attempting to regard not only @xmath9 as the `` internal clock '' ( emergent time ) but also @xmath0 as the `` internal rod ''  namely , the measurement of both temporal and spatial geometries makes sense only in the presence of matter content .",
    "this observation may support the ideas of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics with real rods and clocks such as studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , although the link is far from clear .",
    "if this concept is taken seriously , in return , we might be able to further improve the @xmath2-scheme to better reflect the underlying physics of lqg such that the difference equation of evolution in the full lqc theory also respects the scaling invariance mentioned above .",
