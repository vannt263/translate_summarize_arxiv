    "nonlinear frequency conversion processes in atomic or molecular gases have attracted much attention since the early days of nonlinear optics .",
    "the interest is mainly motivated by the possibility to generate coherent radiation in the xuv and vuv frequency range , where there are no transparent nonlinear crystals",
    ". however , the conversion efficiencies are usually relatively poor due to small nonlinear susceptibility for the generation and difficulties to prepare proper phase matching conditions .",
    "approaching atomic resonances enhances the nonlinearity , but at the same time absorption , linear refraction and unwanted nonlinear phase shifts increase rapidly .",
    "recently , a new technique has been put forward which substantially improves the nonlinear - optical properties of a medium .",
    "the technique , usually referred to as  nonlinear optics with maximum coherence ",
    ", is based on the preparation of all atoms in the medium in the same coherent superposition of two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 with equal probability amplitudes @xcite . from the classical point of view",
    ", coherently prepared atoms represent an ensemble of dipoles all oscillating at the same frequency @xmath2 , with the same phase and with maximum amplitude .",
    "if a radiation field of frequency @xmath3 is applied to the medium , it will beat against this strong local oscillator to produce the sum- or difference frequency @xmath4 . in this case , the nonlinear susceptibility of the generation process is large ( in fact , it is resonantly enhanced ) and is of the same order as the linear susceptibility .",
    "therefore , complete conversion occurs within an optical length smaller than the coherence length .",
    "consequently , requirements for the phase matching are substantially alleviated and the influence of density - dependent detrimental effects is minimized .    in first proposals and experimental implementations @xcite ,",
    "maximum coherence was established in a lambda - type coupling scheme with ground @xmath0 and lower excited @xmath1 states using stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) @xcite . however , in a lambda - type coupling scheme involving one - photon transitions the generated radiation @xmath4 can not reach far into the vacuum - ultraviolet spectral region @xcite .",
    "multi - photon excitations may not be used in order to reach higher lying states , because laser - induced stark shifts , which are intrinsic to multi - photon transitions , perturb the adiabatic population dynamics and prohibit the preparation of a maximum coherence @xcite .    in the present paper , we investigate the use the stark chirped rapid adiabatic passage ( scrap ) technique @xcite to prepare maximum coherence . in scrap ,",
    "a pump laser couples a thermally populated state ( most likely the ground state ) to an excited state and a second , strong radiation pulse to induce a dynamic stark shift .",
    "this stark shift serves to sweep the atomic transition frequency through resonance with the pump laser frequency , mediating thereby an adiabatic passage of population between two states .",
    "provided the dynamic stark shifts , induced by the second laser are larger than the shifts , induced by the pump field , any multi - photon transition may be used for the pump transition . for a two - photon pump transition ,",
    "it is therefore possible to create coherence between a highly excited state and the ground state .",
    "if ultraviolet radiation is used for the pump laser , coherence between states with energies up to 10 ev may be efficiently created , permitting the generation of vuv radiation well below 150 nm .",
    "the potential of the nonlinear optics with maximum coherence has been demonstrated for the regime of undepleted coherence and hence for an undepleted pump field @xcite .",
    "we consider here a process of difference - frequency mixing involving a two - photon transition @xmath5 resonantly excited by a strong pump field with frequency @xmath6 and a dipole - allowed transition @xmath7 excited off - resonance by an  idler  field with frequency @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in this case ,",
    "energy for the generated field is taken only from the pump field , which at the same time participates in the preparation of the coherence .",
    "therefore , it will unavoidably be depleted if considerable conversion efficiency is expected .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to clarify , how the conversion proceeds when the pump field is depleted , what fraction of the total energy of the pump field may be transferred to the generated ( and idler ) field , and which parameters are needed in the specific case of coherence preparation by scrap . to this end , we solve the nonlinear propagation problem taking into account the pump field depletion .",
    "the solution of such a nonlinear problem is particularly challenging for pulses and is in general possible only numerically . in order to obtain analytical solutions",
    "we apply the so - called hamiltonian approach @xcite which allows for a solution in a wide range of physically relevant situations .",
    "an essence of this formalism is to reduce a set of maxwell propagation equation to canonical hamilton equations of classical mechanics , which admit several integrals of motion .",
    "additionally , this approach allows to analyze phase matching conditions taking into account intensity - dependent ( kerr effect ) contributions , which are not present in the simple treatment of undepleted coherence .",
    "this approach is especially useful under adiabatic conditions , i.e. when the atoms are excited by the laser pulses in such a way that they remain in the same instantaneous eigenstate of the interaction hamiltonian during the entire process .",
    "this is the case in the atomic superposition prepared by scrap , as it is discussed here .",
    "obviously the large atomic coherence should be maintained for the duration of the conversion process .",
    "since the coherent superposition includes a highly excited state , this requirement restricts the conversion to a regime with laser pulses of duration shorter than the natural lifetimes in the system .",
    "this is however not in contradiction with the adiabaticity of scrap .",
    "the adiabatic approximation requires a slow rate of evolution as compared to the frequency separation of the adiabatic eigenstates .",
    "this results usually in a requirement for the product of the pulse duration and the rabi frequency of the radiation field to be much larger than unity .",
    "thus , for sufficiently intense fields , the process can be adiabatic even for short pulses .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the frequency conversion of short pulses and disregard spontaneous relaxation processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we discuss general features and advantages of nonlinear frequency conversion processes with respect to atomic coherence .",

    "@xmath21 are the components of the medium polarization : @xmath24    the pulse at frequency @xmath25 (  ac stark - shifting pulse  ) propagates along the @xmath18 axis and is far detuned from any atomic state .",
    "therefore , we assume that its intensity does not change along the propagation path . in reality , the presence of the pulse at @xmath25 leads to generation of @xmath26 frequency components .",
    "however , an efficiency of their generation is much smaller than that for the @xmath3 field due to the off - resonant character of the interaction of the @xmath25 pulse with the medium .",
    "moreover , the presence of these ( weak ) components does not influence processes considered in the present paper .",

    "we have discussed the analytic solutions of a four - wave mixing process involving preparation of an atomic system driven to maximum coherence by the technique of stark chirped rapid adiabatic passage ( scrap ) .",
    "the maximum coherence permits conversion efficiencies , exceeding the case of conventional nonlinear optics by a large factor . however , the conversion efficiency does not reach unity , because of phase mismatch due to the linear and the intensity - dependent index of refraction .",
    "it is practically impossible to compensate both parts simultaneously .",
    "thus , the conversion efficiency gets maximum when the linear part of the phase mismatch is reduced to zero .",
    "this can be done by the controlling the residual phase mismatch @xmath67 through the buffer gas or non - collinear pulse propagation .",
    "unfortunately , the kerr - induced mismatch is large and limits the rate and the maximum achievable efficiency of the conversion .",
