    "so far , a number of methods for first - principles electronic - structure calculations implemented entirely in real space have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these have desirable properties compared with the usual plane - wave and/or the linear combination of atomic orbital approaches : ( i ) since all of the calculations are carried out in real space , it is easy to incorporate localized wannier - type orbitals , which are localized in a finite region required for the realization of @xmath0 calculations , into the algorithm .",
    "( ii ) a technique utilizing a real - space double - grid @xcite is available within the real - space finite - difference ( rsfd ) formalism , where many grid points are put in the vicinity of nuclei , so that the integrals involving rapidly varying pseudopotentials inside the core regions of atoms can be calculated with a high degree of accuracy . (",
    "iii ) in order to improve the calculation accuracy , the grid spacing should be narrowed , the procedure of which is simple and definite . even more important",
    "is that ( iv ) boundary conditions are not constrained to be periodic , e.g. , a combination of periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions for surfaces @xcite and wires @xcite , and twist boundary conditions for helical nanotubes are applicable .",
    "this aspect ( iv ) is significantly advantageous to electron - conduction calculations , because an nonperiodic boundary is indispensable for the direction in which electrons flow @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a set of efficient techniques for the rsfd approach . in order to demonstrate the applicability of these techniques",
    ", we calculate the electronic structures of atoms and molecules by the rsfd approach using isolated boundary condition and that of a @xmath1 carbon nanotube utilizing the twist boundary condition .",
    "in particular , the real - space calculations with the twist boundary conditions are appropriate for helical nanotubes , since the translational repeat distance leads to extremely large supercells , although the nanotubes can be constructed with one - dimensional translational symmetry .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , iii , and iv , we give in detail the efficient procedures for real - space calculations together with examples , and in sec . v , we conclude with a discussion on the future direction of the rsfd calculations .",
    "the discretization of the kohn - sham equation in the rsfd formalism is addressed in appendix .",
    "in the rsfd formalism , wave functions , electronic charge density , and potentials are all represented on the discrete grid . in general , the discretizations of them are not invariant under uniform translations of the system respect to the position of the grid , which leads a serious problem in practical simulations : the total energy varies unphysically depending on the relative positions of grid points and the nucleus .",
    "this problem can be avoided by reducing the grid spacing ; however , a fine grid may require so many points as to result in a substantial increase in computational effort . with this as a background ,",
    "the timesaving double - grid technique was introduced @xcite to circumvent this problem easily .",
    "we here extend this technique so that it can be applied to local parts of pseudopotentials as well as nonlocal pseudopotentials .",
    "the double - grid consists of two sorts of uniform and equi - interval grid points , i.e. , coarse and dense ones , depicted in fig .  1 by `` @xmath2 '' and `` @xmath3 '' , respectively .",
    "the dense - grid region enclosed by the circle is the core region of an atom that is taken to be sufficiently large to contain the cutoff region of pseudopotentials . throughout this paper",
    "we postulate that the wave functions and the charge densities are defined and updated _ only on coarse - grid points _ , while pseudopotentials are strictly given _ on all dense - grid points _ in an analytically or numerically exact manner . in the case of using the pseudopotential parameterized by bachelet _",
    "_ @xcite and troullier and martins @xcite with the kleinman - bylander nonlocal form @xcite , the ionic pseudopotential term in the total energy is defined as    @xmath4,\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the number of occupied states and @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the electron density , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 represent the position of the @xmath11-th nucleus , the local pseudopotential which varies rapidly around the nucleus ( hard local part ) , and the local pseudopotential which changes gently ( soft local part ) , respectively .",
    "the procedure of decomposing the local pseudopotential is explained below .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the nonlocal parts of the pseudopotentials and the pseudowave functions used to prepare the pseudopotentials , respectively .",
    "the numerical integrations related to @xmath9 and @xmath15 , which vary sharply in the vicinity of nuclei , are performed on the dense grids using the timesaving double - grid technique , whereas the integration related to the gently behaving part @xmath10 is implemented on the coarse grids .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath9 and @xmath15 must vanish outside the core region of the pseudopotential ; otherwise the calculations of pulay forces , which are computationally demanding , are required in molecular - dynamics simulations . while the value of the nonlocal part is zero outside the core region ,",
    "the value of the local part , which is a long - range coulomb potential , is not zero .",
    "thus , in the case of using the pseudopotential parameterized by bachelet _",
    "@xcite , @xmath9 is so set by the following procedure as to be zero outside the core region : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and erf(@xmath19 ) is the error function ( or probability integral ) .",
    "let us first consider the inner products between wave functions @xmath20 and nonlocal parts of pseudopotentials @xmath21 ( see fig .  2 ) . here , we assume a one - dimensional case for simplicity .",
    "the values of wave functions on coarse grid points ( @xmath22 ) are stored in a computer , and the values on dense - grid points ( @xmath3 ) are evaluated by interpolating them .",
    "the known values of pseudopotentials both on coarse- and dense - grid points ( @xmath22 ) are also shown schematically .",
    "then , from fig .  2(a ) one can see that only the values on coarse - grid points are so inadequate that the inner products can not be accurately calculated ; the errors are mainly due to the rapidly varying behavior of pseudopotentials .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "2(b ) indicates that the inner products can be evaluated with a high accuracy , if the number of dense - grid points is taken to be sufficiently large and also if the wave functions on dense - grid points are properly interpolated from those on coarse - grid points @xcite .",
    "there are several interpolation methods for wave functions , among which the simplest is linear interpolation . in this case",
    ", the wave functions @xmath23 on dense - grid points @xmath24 are interpolated from @xmath25 on coarse - grid points @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the grid spacing of the coarse - grid points .",
    "the inner product is assumed to be accurately approximated by the discrete sum over the dense - grid points , i.e. , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the `` diameter '' of the core region , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the number of coarse(dense)-grid points in the core region , @xmath34 is the grid spacing of the dense - grid points , and @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 is the number of dense - grid points existing between adjacent coarse - grid points .",
    "now , substituting eq .",
    "( [ eqn : linear ] ) into the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : inner ] ) , we have @xmath37 where @xmath38    similarly , the inner product of the hard local part and electron density is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the electron density on the coarse - grid point @xmath26 .    as shown in eqs.([eqn : kekka ] ) and ( [ eqn : ono - dg3 ] ) , the inner products have been replaced with _ the summation over coarse - grid points inside the core region _ , which produces only a modest overhead in the computational cost .",
    "note that the weight factors @xmath43 arising from the interpolation are independent of the wave functions , but dependent only on the known values of pseudopotentials on dense - grid points .",
    "thus , if once computing the factors @xmath43 for every molecular - dynamics time step , we do not have to recalculate them throughout self - consistent iteration steps .",
    "the extension of the above procedure to the cases of higher - order interpolations is straightforward .",
    "we now examine the efficiency of the timesaving double - grid technique by incorporating it into the formalism of the rsfd method .",
    "hereafter , we obey the nine - point finite - difference formula , i.e. , @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ono - difference01 ] ) , for the differentiation of the wave function .",
    "the dense - grid spacing is set as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) is the coarse - grid spacing in the @xmath49 direction .",
    "the ninth - order lagrangian interpolation is used in the dense - grid interpolation .",
    "the exchange - correlation effects are treated as the local - spin - density approximation @xcite within the framework of the density - functional theory @xcite .",
    "the pseudopotential database ncps97 @xcite based on the pseudopotential of troullier and martins @xcite is used for the ionic potential .",
    "the isolated boundary condition is imposed for all directions of @xmath19 , @xmath50 and @xmath48 .",
    "first , the convergence of total energy for a hydrogen atom as a function of the cutoff energy is depicted in fig .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , we defined an equivalent energy cutoff @xmath51 [ @xmath52 ry ] to be equal to that of the plane - wave method which uses a fast - fourier - transform grid with the same spacing as the present calculation .",
    "hydrogen is one of the most difficult atoms to treat by the rsfd method because the @xmath11 component of its nonlocal pseudopotential oscillates in the vicinity of the nucleus .",
    "the hydrogen atom is placed in the center of the neighboring grid points for the @xmath19 , @xmath50 and @xmath48 directions . without the use of the double - grid technique",
    ", the total energy does not converge even when the cutoff energy increases to 17 ry .",
    "on the other hand , when the double - grid technique is employed , the total energy converges even with a small cutoff energy ; the total energy converges rapidly and monotonically as the cutoff energy increases .",
    "next , fig .",
    "4 shows the total - energy variation as a function of the displacement of the fluorine atom relative to coarse - grid points along a coordinate axis .",
    "the coarse - grid spacing is set at 0.33 a.u .",
    "the calculation of a model containing a halogen atom requires a quite high cutoff energy because the pseudopotentials of halogen atoms vary rapidly within the core region .",
    "particularly , in the calculation using a discrete grid , such as the rsfd method , the total energy changes in an unphysical manner depending on the relative position of the grid point and the nucleus when the grid spacing is coarse , which prevents us from implementing practical calculations . as seen in fig .  4 ,",
    "the energy variation in our scheme is @xmath530.01% of the total energy ( 650.4 ev ) , which is negligibly small .    as the third example",
    ", we apply the timesaving double - grid technique to the calculation of the equilibrium bond length of f@xmath54 and cu@xmath54 molecules in order to examine the performance of the double - grid method for molecules .",
    "the coarse grid spacings are set at 0.33 a.u .",
    "for the f@xmath54 molecule , and 0.27 a.u .",
    "for the cu@xmath54 molecule .",
    "figure  5 shows the adiabatic potential curves for the respective molecules .",
    "the results without any interpolation have many `` humps '' , and the distances between adjacent humps on the respective dotted curves are close to twice the length of the grid spacing @xmath46 , which confirms that the oscillation depends on the relative position of the atom with respect to coarse - grid points . to circumvent this problem , gygi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a real - space grid in adaptive curvilinear coordinates .",
    "however , owing to the use of these distorted coordinates , their scheme needs _ pulay forces _ in molecular - dynamics simulations ; this is computationally very demanding . on the contrary",
    ", our approach requires only the hellmann - feynman forces , which significantly reduces the computational cost concerning the calculation of forces . as shown in fig .  5",
    ", the locations of the minima in the result using the double - grid technique agree with the equilibrium bond length ( 2.68 a.u . for f@xmath54 and 4.19 a.u .",
    "for cu@xmath54 ) obtained by experiments and other methods .",
    "these results clarify that the present method solves this problem and is very efficient and applicable for practical simulations .",
    "the hartree potential in the kohn - sham equation is commonly evaluated by solving the poisson equation @xmath55 in the case of isolated boundary conditions , one needs to determine the boundary values of the hartree potential just outside of the calculation domain to set up the matrix for solving the poisson equation @xcite . for small systems ,",
    "the numerical summation over the grid is the most direct procedure . on the other hand ,",
    "when the system becomes large , the numerical summation requires so many operations as to result in a demanding scheme , since the computational cost for the direct summation is proportioned to the 5/3 power of the model size .",
    "@xcite proposed the procedure using a multipole expansion of the charge density around an arbitrary point @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 here , @xmath49 and @xmath58 denote @xmath19 , @xmath50 and @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , the functions @xmath59 @xmath60 are the legendre polynomials and @xmath61 is expressed as @xmath62 @xmath63 is the dipole moment , @xmath64 and @xmath65 is similar to quadrupole moment @xcite , @xmath66 by virtue of this method , one can make the computational cost proportioned to the model size .",
    "however , the accuracy of the solution largely depends on the choice of the position @xmath56 because the expansion is carried out only around one point .",
    "we now introduce the fuzzy cell decomposition and multipole expansion ( fcd - mpe ) method , which is free from this problem . a weighting function @xmath67 for the multiple - center system centered at the @xmath11-th nucleus is prepared .",

    "<S> we present a set of efficient techniques in first - principles electronic - structure calculations utilizing the real - space finite - difference method . </S>",
    "<S> these techniques greatly reduce the overhead for performing integrals that involve norm - conserving pseudopotentials , solving poisson equations , and treating models which have specific periodicities , while keeping a high degree of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> since real - space methods are inherently local , they have a lot of advantages in applicability and flexibility compared with the conventional plane - wave approach , and promise to be well suited for large and accurate _ ab initio _ calculations . in order to demonstrate the potential power of these techniques , we present several applications for electronic structure calculations of atoms , molecules and a helical nanotube . </S>"
