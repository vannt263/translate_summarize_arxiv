    "the emergence of quantum collective phenomena opens the path towards quantum phases that do not admit any classical counterpart .",
    "quantum magnets provide a large showcase of materials in which qpts have been experimentally demonstrated .",
    "quantum fluctuations , driving the system through a qpt , can be continuously tuned by _",
    "e.g. _ applying a magnetic field or by exerting pressure on the sample to control the magnetic couplings among the spins .",
    "a well - known example is represented by magnetic bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in spin - gap materials  @xcite , such as systems of weakly coupled @xmath0 dimers .",
    "these magnetic insulators show a paradigmatic quantum - disordered ground state , namely a total singlet state with a gap to all triplet excitations .",
    "application of a magnetic field can close the triplet gap , inducing the appearance of bosonic spin triplets in the ground state of the system , forming a bose condensate of magnetic quasiparticles .",
    "this condensed state corresponds to a magnetically ordered state with spontaneous appearance of a staggered magnetization transverse to the field .    a completely different route towards qpt transitions in quantum magnets",
    "is represented by the effect of non - magnetic doping .",
    "starting from a magnetically ordered state , a simple route towards disordering the system is by diluting the lattice via site or bond removal . a genuine quantum phase transition is realized if quantum fluctuations lead to the loss of magnetic order at @xmath1 before the lattice reaches the percolation threshold .",
    "experimental studies on model magnets , such as non - magnetically doped la@xmath2cuo@xmath3",

    "what better strategy could one envision to tune quantum fluctuations than to consider a system which already exhibits a quantum phase transition in the clean limit ?",
    "this idea brings naturally to the investigation of the effect of disorder on quantum critical phenomena in magnetic systems , and in particular on magnetic bec as a paradigmatic magnetic quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "introducing disorder in the magnetically ordered phase immediately close to the condensation qpt corresponds to exposing the dilute gas of spin triplets induced by the field to a random potential : as in any system of weakly interacting quantum particles , this leads to anderson localization for moderate ( or even infinitesimal ) disorder strengths @xcite .",
    "this property translates into the possibility of disrupting the field - induced magnetic order by diluting the lattice well below the percolation threshold , accomplishing in this way a genuine disorder - induced quantum phase transition .",
    "a side effect of doping weakly coupled dimer systems is the appearance of unpaired @xmath0 local moments , which are coupled through virtual excitations of the intact dimers @xcite ( see fig.[f.dimers](a ) ) .",
    "the resulting random network of interacting local moments can support long - range antiferromagnetic order in zero field , giving rise to a counter - intuitive phenomenon of order by disorder ( obd ) .",
    "this ordered state is found to be disrupted by the application of a moderate magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the resulting disordered phase shows short - range antiferromagnetic correlations surviving on localized regions , which can be mapped onto anderson localized quasiparticles .",
    "hence we see in general that disorder - induced quantum phase transitions drive the system to novel quantum disordered phases with rather exotic properties .",
    "a common denominator of these phases is a gapless spectrum associated with the appearance of low - energy localized excitations , associated with exponentially rare regions in the disordered lattice . if the energy cost of the localized excitation decreases algebraically with the inverse size of the region that hosts it , all conventional response functions remain non - singular in this phase down to @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the same energy cost decreases exponentially when the size of the region increases , this leads to quantum griffiths singularities @xcite with a non - universal , disorder - dependent divergent behavior in measurable quantities such as the uniform susceptibility .     .",

    "this topic is particularly challenging from a technical point of view .",
    "indeed conventional perturbation methods are generally doomed to fail at quantum critical points ; renormalization group schemes , while generally successful for the study of critical points in clean systems , prove to be particularly hard for critical points in presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "a third way is provided by numerically exact methods , which are particularly well developed for unfrustrated quantum spin systems . in particular we make use of the stochastic series expansion quantum monte carlo method @xcite which proves to be a very powerful quantum monte carlo technique to investigate the low - temperature properties of quantum spin systems on a large scale .",
    "the non - local nature of the update algorithm makes it possible to circumvent critical slowing down and to investigate quantum critical phenomena in a very accurate way .",
    "while disorder imposes the extra cost of averaging over disorder statistics , this task can be accomplished on modern supercomputers .",

    "we will consider the case of zero applied magnetic field @xmath19 , while the effects of a finite field will be accounted for in the next section .    in the clean limit , the 2dqhaf is well known to support long - range nel order@xcite .",

    "in which the geometric transition and the magnetic one are decoupled by quantum fluctuations .",
    "this scenario invokes the fact that spins involved in locally strongly fluctuating quantum states , such as dimer singlets and resonating valence bond states , are weakly correlated with the remainder of the system . in a random network of spins ,",
    "the local strongly fluctuating states create _ weak links _ with small spin - spin correlations",
    ". if these weak links are part of the backbone of the percolating cluster , they can prevent the percolating cluster from developing long - range order . therefore , if lattice dilution favors the local formation of such states , it is possible to drive the system towards a quantum disordered state before the percolation threshold is reached , decoupling percolation from magnetic ordering .",
    "this quantum percolation scenario has been recently demonstrated for the @xmath0 heisenberg model on the bilayer lattice under dimer dilution  @xcite . in this",
    "model quantum fluctuations can be arbitrarily tuned by increasing the strength of the inter - layer coupling @xmath6 with respect to the intra - layer one @xmath5 : indeed , even in the clean model , for @xmath27 the spins on each inter - layer dimer form a singlet and long - range order is lost @xcite . randomly diluting the bilayer by taking away a percentage @xmath28 of _ whole dimers _ at once leads to the percolation of the bilayer lattice for @xmath29 , analogously to what happens on a simple square lattice .",
    "for @xmath30 the bilayer shows long - range order up to the percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "the tuning knob of quantum fluctuations offered by the inter - layer coupling allows to destroy long - range order on the percolating cluster for @xmath31 : beyond this value , geometric percolation of the lattice is no longer a sufficient condition for long - range magnetic ordering , due to the extremely strong quantum fluctuations on dimers with lower local connectivity .",
    "the quantum disordered phase appearing on a percolated lattice of dimers still lacks a complete characterization , but it is legitimate to suspect that , for @xmath32 , rare but arbitrarily large regions which are devoid of dimer vacancies can support locally magnon - like excitations similar to those of the clean system in its magnetically ordered phase .",
    "hence the spectrum of the system is expected to be _ gapless _ , but not leading to a singular contribution to the response functions ( as shown by the regular behavior of the uniform susceptibility in ref .",

    "explicitly    @xmath35    @xmath36    as it is well - known , @xmath0 spin ladders have a quantum disordered singlet ground state @xcite , and the same applies to weakly connected dimer lattices , such as the comb lattice .",

    "when such geometrical structures appear on the backbone of the percolating cluster , they can effectively break it into sub - clusters from the point of view of magnetic correlations , leading to a quantum - disordered ground state .",

    "it is important to stress that here we only consider percolating clusters with an _ even _ number of particles , which means that the ground state on a finite - size system is expected to be a total spin singlet .",
    "hence the presence of a non - universal divergence of the uniform susceptibility is not due to the presence of paramagnetic dangling spins , but it is a genuine result of the fact that the spectrum over the singlet ground state is gapless .    from an experimental point of view , bond dilution can be considered as a limit of bond disorder introduced by doping the non - magnetic atoms / ions lying on the super - exchange paths responsible for the occurrence of antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "hence inhomogeneous bond disorder can be introduced in antiferromagnets in which super - exchange paths are mediated by different atomic species along different spatial directions .",

    "in the previous section , we have seen that lattice dilution can locally enhance quantum fluctuations in a quantum magnet , possibly discarding long - range order . in this section the critical role of quantum fluctuations will be tuned arbitrarily by driving the system close through a quantum phase transition in presence of disorder .",

    "the bosonic system will be _ fragmented _ into anderson - localized states , sitting in the rare regions which are devoid of vacancies .",
    "this phase is called _ bose glass _ in the literature of disordered interacting bosons @xcite .",
    "given that we are effectively working in the grand - canonical ensemble , the transition from a condensed phase to a bose glass is accompanied by a decrease in the population , due to the fact that disorder lowers dramatically the local chemical potential in the regions close to impurities .",
    "this same localization - condensation transition can be probed by varying the field at fixed disorder strength : in this case the transition is clearly understood as a reduction of the density of the qps / qhs , induced by the decrease / increase of the magnetic field . when traversing this transition in the reversed sense , by driving it with either a field or with disorder , we observe that the region occupied by the qps / qhs undergoes a quantum percolation transition from a localized disordered phase , in which only disconnected rare clean regions host qps / qhs , to a percolated ordered phase , in which the regions hosting qps / qhs connect to form a percolating network .",

    "this means that that the system displays a finite response to an applied magnetic field , namely its uniform susceptibility remains finite ( corresponding to a finite compressibility of the qps / qhs ) even in absence of long - range coherence .",

    "so far we have worked under the assumption that dangling spins left unpaired by site dilution are fully polarized by the field .",
    "actually the evolution of their magnetic state represents another very fascinating aspect of the physics of these systems .",
    "indeed , as already mentioned in the previous sections , in zero field dilution liberates local @xmath0 moments ( lms ) which are exponentially localized close to the site of an unpaired spin and which interact with each other via the effective couplings of eq .",
    "[ e.jeff ] .",

    "yet the long - range order appearing in this phase can be easily destroyed by a small field in a quite peculiar way @xcite .",
    "indeed the system of lms features highly inhomogeneous couplings , and hence the response to the field is equally diverse . in the case of low dilution ( to which this discussion is restricted )",
    "most of the lms are weakly coupled to the other nearby lms which sit at a distance of the order of the average inter - vacancy spacing @xmath86 ; but a minority of the lms might be involved in a lm dimer ( with probability @xmath87 ) , in a trimer ( with probability @xmath88 ) , and so on .",
    "this means that when the field is strong enough to overcome the _ typical _ coupling energy between two lms , it polarizes a majority of lms destroying thereby their long - range magnetic order . yet , in this _ disordered lm _ phase , a minority of strongly coupled lms resist polarization , and they host locally one or more spin which is polarized opposite to the field . in particular , a mapping of the localized @xmath0 spins which remain antiparallel to the field onto hardcore bosons , reveals for the disordered lm phase a clear nature of a bose glass , characterized by fragmentation of a bose gas into disconnected localized states .",
    "this can be quantitatively confirmed by a finite - size scaling study of the transition between the order - by - disorder phase and the disordered lm phase : the extracted critical exponents turn out to be fully consistent with those of the 2d superfluid - to - bose - glass transition @xcite . in particular , as in a bose glass , the disordered lm phase is not fully polarized , and it remains _ gapless _ , given that all different clusters of strongly coupled lms see a different magnetic environment and hence exhibit a different local gap to further polarization .",
    "nonetheless the local gaps are distributed around some distinct values associated with lm dimers , trimers , etc .",
    "these values manifest themselves in a special form of the magnetization curve , exhibiting _ pseudo - plateaus _ which mark the accomplished polarization of one class of lm clusters .     and",

    "phase ( characterized by a marked plateau of the uniform magnetization at the value @xmath91 ) appears , completely separating the physics of the lms from that of the intact dimers . on the other hand , for smaller @xmath63 ratios or strong dilution the plateau phase might be completely washed out , and dimers start being magnetized in the bose glass phase when lms have not yet been fully polarized .",
    "in this case disordered lm phase and bose glass phase coexist : indeed the bose glass phase will show both localized triplet qps in rare regions devoid of impurities , and localized anti - parallel spins in the complementary regions exhibiting clustering of impurities .",
    "in conclusion , large - scale quantum monte carlo simulations give access to the vast wealth of novel quantum phases appearing in quantum magnets when quantum fluctuations are tuned to a critical strength in presence of disorder in the magnetic lattice .",
    "these novel phases are the result of the separation , induced by quantum fluctuations , between the geometric percolation of the lattice and the loss of long - range magnetic order .",

    "<S> the hamiltonian of the system can be indeed manipulated by applying a magnetic field or pressure on the sample . when doping the system with non - magnetic impurities , novel inhomogeneous phases emerge from the interplay between geometric randomness and quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we review our recent work on quantum phase transitions and novel quantum phases realized in disordered quantum magnets . </S>",
    "<S> the system inhomogeneity is found to strongly affect phase transitions by changing their universality class , giving the transition a novel , quantum percolative nature . </S>",
    "<S> such transitions connect conventionally ordered phases to unconventional , quantum disordered ones - quantum griffiths phases , magnetic bose glass phases - exhibiting gapless spectra associated with low - energy localized excitations .    </S>",
