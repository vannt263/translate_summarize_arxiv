    "graphene has proven to be interesting for the study of conductance fluctuations ( cf ) in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "some of its remarkable properties are the linear low energy band structure @xcite and the k - k degeneracy , which leads to unusual scattering @xcite . in common supported graphene devices disorder",
    "is inevitably introduced by the substrate and cf have been shown to be major corrections to the transport at low temperature .    in numerical calculations",
    "@xcite stronger cf were found away from the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) .",
    "additionally , the cf were reported to be non - ergodic and they were suspected to result from variations in trajectories , rather than in phase shifts @xcite . the results and interpretation of @xcite",
    "were debated in @xcite , where cf were studied analytically and a similar magnitude of the cf was found but with fulfilled ergodicity .",
    "superconducting electrodes can provide additional information on the transport mechanisms in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "phase sensitive andreev reflection can occur at the interface between the superconductor ( s ) and the normal conducting graphene ( g ) . at energies below the superconducting gap @xmath2 electrons from g can only enter s in the form of a cooper pair .",
    "this charge transfer needs time reversal symmetry , which can be broken by the application of an external magnetic field .    in the following ,",
    "we look at cf in a two - terminal graphene device with superconducting contacts .",
    "we compare the cf in the superconducting and normal state of the electrodes .",
    "the latter is achieved by either increasing the temperature or by applying a magnetic field .",
    "the cf near and far away from the cnp are presented .",
    "mechanical microcleavage @xcite was used to deposit the graphene flakes onto a highly p - doped silicon wafer , covered by 300  nm silicon dioxide .",
    "the silicon wafer serves as a back - gate where a voltage @xmath3 is applied .",
    "the graphene flakes on the substrate were located with optical microscopy and categorised by optical contrast . to ensure that the selected flakes are indeed single layer graphene , raman spectroscopy @xcite with 532  nm laser light was performed .",
    "subsequently , a pmma mask was used to pattern the electrical lines by electron beam lithography .",
    "a thin metal film ( 5  nm ti / 50  nm al ) was evaporated on the sample in a uhv e - gun evaporation system .",
    "after lifting the pmma mask off , the sample was cleaned in chemical solvents ( acetone , ethanol and 2-propanol ) and annealed in vacuum at 200  @xmath4c for several hours .",
    "the inset of figure [ bg and sem ] shows a micrograph of the device investigated .",
    "the single layer graphene flake is approximately of length @xmath5  1.3  @xmath6",
    "m and width @xmath7  3.8  @xmath6 m .",
    "electrical measurements were performed in an oxford instruments @xmath8he cryostat at temperatures in the range of 230  mk - 1.5  k. a stanford research systems sr830 lock - in amplifier was used to apply a 20  @xmath6v ac voltage which was superimposed onto a dc voltage @xmath9 .",

    "figure [ bg and sem ] shows the measured two - terminal conductance @xmath11 through the device as a function of the back - gate voltage @xmath3 , for two different temperatures , 230  mk and 1.5  k. at low temperature , the al contacts are in the superconducting state , while for the higher temperature they are normal .",
    "the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) , indicated by the minimum in @xmath11 , lies at @xmath12  15  v which suggests p - doping .",
    "charged impurities introduce scattering and thus disorder @xcite which is responsible for the broad shape of the dip in @xmath11 .    at large doping , i.e. for small negative gate voltages ,",
    "the conductance @xmath11 is reduced in the normal state by 1  e@xmath13/h , while @xmath11 remains the same near the cnp .",
    "this can be explained by the series resistance of the al leads adding to the device in the normal state .",
    "figure [ bg and sem ] also shows that the cf are enhanced in the supercondcuting state .",
    "however , since the measurement in this figure was performed with an applied source - drain bias voltage @xmath14  140  @xmath6v which is similar to @xmath2 , the cf are not fully enhanced by andreev reflection .",
    "we want to focus on three distinct regimes that can be identified in figure [ bg and sem ] : ( i ) high doping with slow change in @xmath11 , ( ii ) intermediate doping with steeply changing @xmath11 and ( iii ) near the cnp .",
    "we expect diffusive transport as in disordered metals in regime ( i ) , whereas in regime ( iii ) near the cnp the graphene properties should dominate .     as a function of the gate voltage @xmath3 and the applied source - drain bias @xmath9 at 230  mk in region ( iii ) .",

    "( b ) measurement of @xmath11 with a 100  mt perpendicular magnetic field applied .",
    "the conductance fluctuations are reduced , as can be seen from the cut ( black solid curve ) at @xmath14  0  v. ]    figure [ greyscales ] displays grey scale plots of @xmath11 in region ( iii ) near the cnp as a function of @xmath9 and @xmath3 at 230  mk . in figure [ greyscales](a ) , the electrodes are in a superconducting state . due to the superconducting gap @xmath2 transport",
    "is expected to be dominated by andreev reflection at low bias voltage @xmath17 , where the factor 2 accounts for the two superconductors defining source and drain contacts . in this bias window",
    "the device displays a suppression @xmath11 , indicative for weakly coupled contacts .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath11 as a function of @xmath3 are largest at zero bias and are reduced by an increased @xmath9 . when applying a small magnetic field , as shown in figure [ greyscales](b ) , the superconductivity is suppressed .",
    "consequently , the fluctuations of @xmath11 at zero bias are visibly reduced .    in order to quantify the change in the conductance fluctuations originating from enhancement due to andreev reflections , we investigate the standard deviation of the conduction , @xmath18 as a function of the bias voltage @xmath9 , as shown in @xcite .     as a function of the applied bias voltage @xmath9 at 230  mk in region ( iii ) .",
    "two regimes can be observed in the superconducting state ( solid line ) : outside of the superconducting gap ( @xmath19  0.3  mv ) , the fluctuations are reduced in comparison to the values in the gap . in 100",
    "mt perpendicular field superconductivity is suppressed and @xmath18 ( dotted line ) . at @xmath20  0.6",
    "mv the normal and superconducting @xmath18 are identical . below @xmath14  0.3  mv ,",
    "the superconducting contacts enhance the fluctuations by a factor of up to 1.5 when compared to @xmath18 in the normal state at 100  mt . ]",
    "figure [ dg - junction ] shows a plot of @xmath18 against @xmath9 near the cnp in ( iii ) . when the electrodes are in a superconducting state , the cf are largest at zero @xmath9 with @xmath21  0.22  e@xmath22/h .",
    "with increasing @xmath9 the cf decrease and reach at @xmath14  1  mv a value of @xmath21  0.14  e@xmath22/h . by comparing the slopes of the steeply changing cf at small @xmath9 and the more slowly varying cf at larger @xmath9 , we can extract a crossover and thus a superconducting gap of @xmath23  300  @xmath6v . in the normal conducting state at 100  mt ,",
    "the cf are about 0.14  e@xmath22/h at @xmath14  1  mv , which coincides with the value of the superconducting electrodes . however , for @xmath24  0.3  mv the cf in the normal state saturate at @xmath25  0.15  e@xmath22/h .",
    "thus the cf in the superconducting state are enhanced by a factor of up to 1.5 compared to the normal state .",
    "when comparing the normal state fluctuations @xmath26 0.15  e@xmath22/h to the theoretical altshuler - lee - stone ( als ) value of @xmath27  e@xmath22/h @xmath28  1.2  e@xmath22/h @xcite , we find that the prediction is almost one order of magnitude larger than the measured value .",
    "one way to resolve this discrepancy is to assume that the phase coherence length @xmath29 is much shorter than the length @xmath30 of the device . assuming that each segment of length @xmath29 is fluctuating independently , yields an overall reduced cf @xcite .",
    "applying this approach to the current values yields a phase coherence length of 300 nm .",
    "however , the fact that the measured cf is nearly doubled in the superconducting states suggests that almost all electrons are within the coherence length of one of the superconducting interface , hence @xmath0 .",
    "this in strong contradicting to the value of @xmath29 estimated from the normal state fluctuations .     as a function of the gate voltage @xmath3 at 230  mk with and without the subtraction of a constant series resistor @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is not subtracted ( black curve ) the cf are stronger in region ( iii ) than in region ( i ) . with @xmath31  1.35",
    "k@xmath32 subtracted the cf are stronger in region ( i ) and decrease when approaching the cnp in region ( iii ) .",
    "( b ) circuit diagram of the device .",
    "a constant resistor @xmath1 is in series with the graphene resistor @xmath33 .",
    "all fluctuations @xmath34 originate in the graphene part . ]",
    "another parameter which can reduce the apparent cf is a built - in series resistance @xmath1 .",
    "this is schematically shown in [ minusrc](b ) .",
    "the graphene part has the resistance @xmath33 which fluctuates with @xmath34 , whereas @xmath35 is assumed to be constant . in practice @xmath1",
    "consists of the electrical lines in the measurement set - up , the input impedance of the iv converter and the resistance of the al contact lines .",
    "in addition , it may also contain to some extent the contact resistance of the device @xcite .",
    "all this is intrinsic to two - terminal measurements .",
    "we assume that @xmath35 is independent of the carrier concentration in the graphene flake .",
    "the subtraction of @xmath1 corrects the measured fluctuations , @xmath36 , by @xmath37 . by adding the known resistance of the measurement setup ( measurement lines and iv converter ) we arrive at a lower boundary of @xmath38  1.35  k@xmath32 .",
    "an upper boundary of @xmath39  k@xmath32 . can be extracted from the quantum hall effect , which due to the magnetic field measures the device in the normal state .",
    "@xmath35 has been deduced from the shifts of the hall plateaus .",
    "figure [ minusrc](a ) compares @xmath11 against @xmath3 at 230  mk with and without @xmath31  1.35  k@xmath32 subtracted . as expected the correction results in the largest change at large doping when @xmath11 is large .",
    "the same is true for the cf , as we will show in the following .    in order to assess the sensitivity of the cf on the value of @xmath35",
    ", we have investigated the dependence of the cf measured at @xmath14  0 and 230  mk for different @xmath35 values , ranging from 0 to 2  k@xmath32 in regime ( i ) ( high doping ) , ( ii ) ( intermediate doping ) , and ( iii ) ( cnp ) .",
    "figure [ dg ] shows the result . in order to calculate @xmath18 a b - spline",
    "was subtracted to account for the non - constant background of the graphene conductance @xmath40 .",
    "the absolute values of the cf are lower than the values found in figure [ dg - junction ] , because there only a linear background was removed .     at 230  mk and @xmath14  0 in dependence on the gate @xmath3 and for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "a b - spline was subtracted from the original data to account for the changing conductivity of the graphene .",
    "( a ) normal conducting electrodes at 100  mt .",
    "the effect of @xmath1 is strongest in region ( i ) . without the subtraction of @xmath1",
    ", @xmath18 increases from ( i ) to ( iii ) . at the largest subtracted @xmath31  2000  @xmath32",
    ", @xmath18 decreases from ( i ) to ( iii ) .",
    "( b ) @xmath18 in the superconducting state .",
    "the cf are enhanced compared to the normal state .",
    "the dependence of the cf on @xmath3 and @xmath1 follows the same tendency as in the normal state . ]    in figure [ dg](a ) the electrical contacts are in a normal conducting state due to the application of a 100  mt magnetic field .",
    "the as measured data ( no @xmath1 subtracted ) shows the smallest cf which increase from 0.03  e@xmath22/h in ( i ) to 0.08  e@xmath22/h in ( iii ) . around the series resistance that we estimated for our set - up ( 1.35  k@xmath32 - 1.5  k@xmath32 )",
    ", the fluctuations are nearly independent of @xmath3 , with values of @xmath41 0.14  e@xmath22/h in regimes ( i ) and ( iii ) . if @xmath31  2  k@xmath32 is subtracted the cf in ( i ) reach 0.45  e@xmath22/h and are reduced to 0.2  e@xmath22/h in ( iii ) .    without the subtraction of @xmath1 ,",
    "the cf are minimal at large doping and increase near the cnp . when @xmath1 is subtracted the cf increase .",
    "however , they increase the most in region ( i ) , less strong in region ( ii ) and the weakest increase is in region ( iii ) .",
    "this can lead to a reversal of the dependence of the cfs on the @xmath3 .",
    "the conductance fluctuations @xmath18 with superconducting contacts are plotted in figure [ dg](b ) .",
    "the measured data without any @xmath1 subtracted shows an increase from 0.07  e@xmath22/h in ( i ) to 0.16  e@xmath22/h near the cnp in ( iii ) .",
    "again , for values of @xmath1 that lie within the estimates for our set - up , the cf vary only weakly with @xmath3 from 0.32  e@xmath22/h in ( i ) to 0.25  e@xmath22/h in ( iii ) . at higher values of @xmath1",
    "the cf decrease significantly from ( i ) to ( iii ) .    evidently , the superconductivity enhances the cf in all three regimes . in ( i ) and ( iii ) the enhancement lies close to a factor of 2 .",
    "yet in regime ( ii ) it appears to be consistently higher and reaches a factor of 3 . in part",
    "this large enhancement factor originates from the resistance of the aluminium electrodes , which is approximately 100  @xmath32 in the normal state in our device .",
    "if we consider this difference , we find an enhancement factor of around 1.9 for ( i ) and ( iii ) , but still above 2 for regime ( ii ) .",
    "in recent experiments contradicting observations were made . in @xcite an increase of the cf near the cnp",
    "was seen , where the increase of the cf from high charge carrier concentration to near the cnp was attributed to the formation of electron - hole puddles . in contrast , a decrease of cf near the cnp was found in @xcite .",
    "the changes in the cf were reported to be of a factor of 3 or larger . gate independent cf were observed in @xcite . as in our device ,",
    "@xcite rely on two - terminal measurements , which include @xmath1 , whereas @xcite use a four - terminal set - up , where @xmath1 is irrelevant . as shown above , we can see all three gate dependences if we subtract @xmath1 . nevertheless , for the range of @xmath1 that we estimate for our set - up , we find nearly no change in cf at high charge carrier density and near the cnp in our graphene device .",
    "using graphene devices with superconducting contacts , we have shown that cfs are enhanced in the superconducting relative to the normal state of the contacts .",
    "this enhancement amounts to a factor between 1.4 and 2 and thus suggests that all electrons in the device of length @xmath5  1.3  @xmath6 m are within the coherence length of one of the two contacts where andreev reflection occurs which is the origin of the doubling @xcite .",
    "the phase coherence length at 230  mk is therefore large and amounts to @xmath0 .",
    "we established a constant series resistor @xmath1 to account for our two - terminal measurement set - up and device and investigated its impact on the cf . for values of @xmath1 that we estimated for our set - up and device the cf remain smaller than e@xmath22/h .",
    "furthermore , we investigated the dependence of the cf on the back - gate voltage @xmath3 .",
    "a strong dependence on @xmath1 is found . without subtraction of @xmath1",
    "the cf increase around the cnp compared to the cf at high doping . in the range of appropriate @xmath1",
    "the cf are nearly independent of @xmath3 .",
