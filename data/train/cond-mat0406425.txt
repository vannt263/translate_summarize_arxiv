    "this paper is devoted to the interdisciplinary theory of selforganization processes , paying particular attention to stochastic effects connected with innovations in network systems . in our understanding",
    "`` selforganization '' is the spontaneous formation of structures @xcite .",
    "an `` innovation '' , in a general system - theoretical understanding , is the appearance of a new species , of a new mode of behavior , of a new technology , of a new product or of a new idea etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "technological innovations are considered as the basic driving process for economic evolution and growth . in economics , innovation networks",
    "@xcite and networks economies @xcite have been discussed widely in the last decade .",
    "however , a unified understanding of socio - economic networks is still missing @xcite .",
    "`` for many economists the study of networks is limited to the analysis of the functioning of physical networks such as the railway , the telephone system or the internet for example '' @xcite .",
    "although networks are thought to be constituted by sets of actors and by links @xcite , the very nature of these actors and the links between them varies among different authors .",
    "nations , institutions , firms , products , or individuals may represent the actors .",
    "the links can be defined quite differently .",
    "innovation in such a context is mostly seen as an outcome of complex networks with heterogeneous actors .    in this paper , we define innovation not as a product of a network activity but as a specific process in the formation of a complex network . thus , innovation is a process in the structure formation of a complex networks .",
    "we describe innovation as a process which dramatically and decisively changes the composition of a network .",
    "accordingly , the network will behave differently depending on which innovation has been introduced .",
    "more specifically , we propose a network description for dynamic processes in a system . by means of this system - theoretical perspective",
    "the appearance of innovations is related to certain mechanisms in the growth and change of networks .",
    "so , we create a network picture for dynamic processes as the emergence , survival or extinction of innovations which have been also considered in the mathematical theory of biological evolution , in population biology and other fields of complexity theory .",
    "in this paper we will follow a special approach to describe innovations in evolutionary systems .",
    "we start in section 1 with an abstract definition of an innovation",
    ". we will then show that our approach is related to recent developments in statistical physics which best can be described as an emerging field of complex networks theory @xcite . thus we will first give a survey of network approaches ranging from chemical networks @xcite to biochemical webs @xcite , protein webs @xcite , food webs @xcite , to the structure of the internet @xcite and the world wide web @xcite up to general approaches from statistical mechanics @xcite .    in the second part of the paper we reflect upon structure and relations of socio - economic networks in a static ( purely structural ) picture .",
    "we will discuss some earlier results of random graph theory and percolation theory .",
    "we derive statements about connectivity and strongly connected components .    in the third part of the paper , and in connection with our special interest in innovation processes",
    ", we will develop a dynamic network theory and in particular the theory of `` sensitive '' networks in more detail .",
    "the term `` sensitive '' networks denotes networks which are sensitive to the introduction or removal of one or few nodes or edges , or in a more general context , to the occupation or leaving of a node .",
    "specifically , sensitivity is linked to the question of whether a node ( a species , a mode of behavior , an idea , a technology ) is occupied by at least one individual or not",
    ". we will show that this problem is of relevance for the modeling of innovation processes .",
    "the dynamics of innovation processes may be described by stochastic equations , which can be formally treated within the framework of statistical physics .",
    "some generalizations are possible .      in economics , innovation is mainly understood as technological innovation describing the introduction of new technologies , products and production processes .",
    "the differentiation between invention and innovation relates innovation to the economic exploitation of new ideas .",
    "however , it is also possible to look at innovations from a more general , evolutionary point of view .",
    "ziman gives one example for such an approach when he writes `` go to a technological museum and look at the bicycles .",
    "then go to a museum of archaeology and look at the prehistoric stone axes .",
    "finally , go to a natural history museum and look at fossil horses .",
    "in each case , you will see a sequence , ordered in time of changing but somewhat similar objects . ''",
    "@xcite , p.",
    "however , not every change is an innovation . in this paper",
    ", we follow a system theoretical approach to innovation . in this framework , innovation is something new to the system and most essentially the emergence of an innovation changes the state of the system dramatically . in other words ,",
    "the actual state of the system becomes unstable and a transition to a new state occurs . to define an innovation we first have to define the state of the system",
    "here , we again choose a very specific approach .",
    "we represent the state of the system as a point in the high dimensional occupation number space @xcite . in this space",
    "a coordinate axis is attached to a certain type @xmath0 of elements ( with @xmath1 , natural numbers ) .",
    "the occupation numbers are represented on this axis .    to describe technological innovation we have to ask for a re - specification of this abstract concept . for socio - economic systems ,",
    "the axes of the state space refer to different possible taxonomies . for instance",
    ", an axis @xmath0 can represent a certain technology from a set @xmath2 , of different technologies present in the system .",
    "with such a technological taxonomy , competition processes between technologies can be described @xcite .",
    "the carriers of this competition process are firms using different technologies and competing with their products on a market .",
    "this way , we link back to an economic understanding of an innovation process that `` requires insight into system dynamics grounded in a variety of firm competencies and behaviour and a variety of demand '' @xcite , p.  5 .",
    "let us note that the state space concept can be applied to quite different processes .",
    "the type @xmath0 might also stand for the size class that a certain firm belongs to",
    ". then , growth processes of firms are in the focus of the description .",
    "moreover , the type @xmath0 may represent a certain group in society .",
    "formation of political opinions @xcite or emergence of norms and violence in groups @xcite are then considered .",
    "innovation in these cases covers new forms of collective behavior .",
    "we can find each type @xmath0 in @xmath3 exemplars of elements in the system .",
    "the exemplars may be individuals , but also organizational and institutional units like firms and groups .",
    "@xmath3 , the occupation numbers , are functions of time .",
    "they are positive or zero .",
    "a complete set of occupation numbers @xmath4 at a fixed time , characterizes the occupation state of this system . the time dependent change of the occupation numbers is described by the movement of this point in the space",
    "the whole motion takes place on the non - negative cone @xmath5 of the space . in this picture",
    "we can describe the case , that a type @xmath0 is not present in the system at time @xmath6 .",
    "that means the type @xmath0 is occupied with the number zero ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we call a system an under - occupied system if we can make the assumption that the sum of the occupation numbers is essentially smaller than the total number of the possible elements @xcite .    in this picture ,",
    "an innovation is an occupation of a non - occupied type . in deterministic systems",
    ", zero occupation can only be achieved in the limit of infinite time @xmath8 , if a sort died out ( zero can be a stable stationary state ) .",
    "for finite times @xmath9 types can not arise , if they are not in the system at time @xmath10 , and present types can not die out .",
    "the situation is different if we use the stochastic picture .",
    "in stochastic systems the zero state can be reached in finite times @xmath6 . a stochastic description offers the advantage that at finite times new sorts ( innovations ) can arise or die out",
    "therefore , the stochastic description is especially suited for evolutionary processes and in particular for innovation processes .",
    "let us note here that any innovation will change the taxonomy of types in the system @xcite .",
    "innovation has to do with uncertainty and its prediction is impossible . with the notion of an under - occupied system",
    "we escape the problem of determining _ a priori _ the place or kind of an innovation .",
    "instead , we equip the system with a reservoir of possible innovations . which of these possibilities turns into a realization remains uncertain . in some respects",
    "this is a trick to avoid the problem with a changing taxonomy .",
    "there are other possibilities to escape this problem , e.g. , so - called continuous models operating on a characteristic space as we discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "however , the discrete approach has , in our respect , certain advantages , as we will discuss later .    in an under - occupied system",
    "most elements have , at a given time @xmath6 , the occupation number zero .",
    "so we can pass from the high - dimensional cone @xmath5 to a lower - dimensional cone @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , the time dependent variation of the system can be described as a switching of the state point on the edges of the cone @xmath5 . if @xmath11 is an element of the set of all possible cones ,",
    "we observe a switch from one sub - cone to another . as",
    "the process is discrete , it is a hopping on the edges of different positive cones .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we visualize such a process for three dimensions . at any point in time , the state of the system is represented by a certain vector @xmath12 . in a stationary state ,",
    "the endpoint of this vector defines a positive cone .",
    "in our example , the vector moves in the plane spanned by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "an innovation opens up a new dimension of the system . in our example , a new third type is introduced into the system . after the innovation ,",
    "the vector is moving in the space defined by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in general , we can assume that the system operates in a multidimensional space where the cone can have a very complicated shape , and the vector @xmath12 jumps between the edges of this cone .",

    "innovations are seen as stochastic instabilities .",
    "the changes occurring in the occupation number space result from interactions of the different types present in the system .",
    "these interactions can be visualized as graphs or networks where the nodes represent the types , and links between them represent different forms of interactions . in the network picture",
    ", an innovation corresponds to the appearance of a new node and the activation of a link to this node .",
    "the models we will present in section 3 allow us to differentiate between different processes which finally introduce such a new node .",
    "the conceptualization of types as elements ( nodes ) of a network represents a graph theoretical approach to the dynamics of the system .",
    "therefore , other network approaches are of particular relevance to develop our theoretical approach further .",
    "we will use the following part of section 1 to introduce the new emerging specialty of complex network theory and to place our approach in this field .      in the last years",
    ", complex systems in nature and society have been carefully investigated .",
    "already in the 70s , theories of self - organization were used to build a bridge between social and natural systems investigations @xcite . as part of this development complex networks have been investigated . recently , as a new branch in complexity theory @xcite complex networks have been reconsidered and extensively studied @xcite .",
    "they seem to be particularly relevant for the study of innovation processes .    in the context of complexity theory ,",
    "the concept of networks has not only been used as an easy - to - use metaphor . as bornholdt and schuster note : `` recent advances in the theory of complex networks indicate that this notion may be more than just a philosophical term",
    ". triggered by recently available data on large real world networks ( e.g. , on the structure of the internet or on the molecular networks in the living cell ) combined with fast computer power on the scientist s desktop , an avalanche of quantitative research on network structure and dynamics currently stimulates diverse scientific fields.''@xcite , p.  v. social networks form one important area of application of complex networks theory .",
    "the structures found cover networks of collaboration @xcite , networks of recognition ( citation networks ) @xcite and networks of corporate directors @xcite . in economic theories ,",
    "innovation is more and more understood as the outcome of the interaction between scientific , economic and political systems @xcite . instead of considering an innovation as a singular event the network character of innovations is stressed .",
    "innovation networks seem to be a new organizational form of knowledge production .",
    "the structural analysis of systems is of great interest .",
    "albert and barabsi @xcite give a very good presentation of this subject and its development .",
    "in the very beginning , investigations of large complex systems were done by random graphs .",
    "more and more it became possible to analyze real complex systems and large systems too . with the development of computer capacity , the amount of empirical data increases .",
    "it becomes possible to compare the theoretical results by random graph theory with that of the real data analysis . obviously more than pure randomness exists .",
    "organization principles and rules of system evolution play a decisive role , leading to small - world behaviour and scale - free networks .",
    "our world is not a random world .",
    "other evolutionary principles are of great interest .",
    "in addition , it is evident that a theory of evolving networks may give a more realistic approach to real systems .",
    "this is why we give special consideration to evolving networks here .    from the analysis of empirical data we learn that many real - networks have a small - world character .",
    "the small - world concept describes the fact that despite their often large size , in most networks there is a relatively short path between any two nodes .",
    "the small - world property characterizes most complex networks .",
    "for example , the chemicals in a cell are typically separated by only three reactions , or in a more exotic case , the actors in hollywood are on average within three co - stars from each other .",
    "the small - world concept corresponds to our observations ; it is a structural , not an organizing , principle @xcite .",
    "not all nodes in a network have the same number of edges ( the same node degree ) . the spread in node degrees",
    "is characterized by a distribution function @xmath18 , which gives the probability that a randomly selected node has exactly @xmath19 edges . since in a random graph",
    "the edges are placed randomly , the majority of nodes have approximately the same degree , close to the average degree of the network .",
    "the degree - distribution of a random graph is a poisson distribution with the peak over the average degree @xcite . in real networks",
    "the distributions of the edges are more complicated .",
    "important results were obtained by the analysis of large real systems : the degree distribution deviates significantly from a poisson distribution and follows general structural rules in many cases .",
    "many large networks are scale - free , that is , their degree distribution follows a power law .",
    "in addition , even for those networks for which @xmath18 has an exponential character , the degree distribution significantly deviates from a poisson distribution achieved by random graph theory for such systems @xcite .    scale - free networks express a hierarchy between the nodes .",
    "not every node is important at the same level .",
    "accordingly , not each of the links between the types have the same importance .",
    "there are very sensitive relations or elements too .",
    "as mentioned previously , we consider networks as `` sensitive '' if their properties depend strongly on the introduction or removal of one or a few nodes or edges , or on changes of the occupation of nodes .",
    "we will show that for the evolutionary character , the description of the time - behaviour by master equations on occupation number spaces is an appropriate tool .",
    "the discrete character of occupation number description allows for an appropriate description of the introduction respectively of removal of relations , edges etc .. we will analyze not only the steady states of our stochastic systems but also the time evolution .",
    "albert and barabsi @xcite also refer to approaches with master and rate equations .",
    "they write that in addition , these methods , not using a continuum assumption , appear more suitable for obtaining exact results in more challenging network models .",
    "in addition they mentioned that the functional form of the degree distribution , @xmath18 , can not be guessed until the microscopic details of the network evolution are fully understood . according to our point of view ,",
    "the method of master equations is an excellent tool to use in the investigation of many open questions and is able to bring much more light to bear on this subject .",
    "for example , by using this discrete approach , we have the chance to get statements about the kind of fluctuations .",
    "evidently this is one of the most important questions .",
    "let us come back now to the question of the distribution of the graph .",
    "we remember that random graph theory leads to a poisson degree - distribution .",
    "albert and barabsi @xcite give a near exhaustive survey of empirical data sets for real complex networks and show that the real degree - distributions are not poisson - distributions , but scale - free - distributions , or exponential distributions .",
    "these authors write :  the high interest in scale - free networks might give the impression that all complex networks in nature have power - law degree distributions .",
    " it is true that several complex networks of high interest for scientific community , such as the world wide web , cell networks , the internet , some social networks , and the citation network are scale - free .",
    "however , others , such as the power grid or the neural networks of c.  elegans , appear to be exponential  evolving networks can develop both power - law and exponential degree distributions . while the power - law regime appears to be robust , sublinear preferential attachment , aging effects , and growth constraints lead to crossovers to exponential decay . ",
    "if all processes shaping the topology of a certain network are properly incorporated , the resulting @xmath18 often has a rather complex form , described by a combination of power laws and exponentials .     in this respect our aim here is the calculation of the role of fluctuations by the use of the master equation approach .",
    "this way we can make statements as to how the systems differ from linear systems which obey a poisson - distribution . in principle , by investigating the fluctuations , correlations and spectral - densities , we are able to study several microscopic events .",
    "one of the questions to solve is which fluctuation effects produce power - law distributions .",
    "we see a deep connection of these network systems to systems which produce @xmath20-noise .",
    "we remember that @xmath20-noise is a stochastic process with a specific power - law spectrum @xcite .",
    "a characteristic property of processes which produce @xmath20-noise are long range - correlations .",
    "we suppose that the scale - free networks and small - world - behaviour may have some relation to this .",
    "we remember that in small - world networks the degree - function obeys an power - law ; there exists a small pathway between each two of the elements .    in investigating selforganization and evolution processes in networks ,",
    "our basic approach is that we understand the corresponding networks as dynamic , or more precisely , as evolutionary systems .",
    "this dynamic and evolutionary approach allows us to make statements about innovation processes , special competition effects , the sensitivity of networks , the constraints of growth and the fitness of network systems .",
    "with respect to their structure , social connections are relations between elements . therefore ,",
    "as can be found in each handbook of social network analysis , relational data form the basis of social networks @xcite .",
    "such data describe ties , connections , group attachments , meetings and other events or activities that relate one individual to another one . from the abstract point of view ,",
    "socio - economic networks are `` structures '' .",
    "it is possible to give an abstract presentation of such structures by means of mathematical tools .",
    "the mathematical idea of structure stands in close connection to the terms    element , set , relation and operation .",
    "the nature of the elements does not play any role with respect to the structure .",
    "opposite to this , the nature of the relations between elements determines the specificity of a structure .",
    "structure here means the manifold of interactions between the elements .",
    "let us note here , that for many descriptions of socio - economic networks as in sociology and economics , it is just the nature of the elements and the relations which are relevant . in this paper , we follow a more abstract and general approach . by using such a general level",
    ", we create methodologically the task of re - specifying the definition of both elements and relations for any application area that one might think of . on the other hand ,",
    "the high level of generalization we use here keeps the application areas open , as we intend to do .",
    "the idea of `` structure '' is of great importance in our life  both in reality and in sciences . in particular",
    ", it is obvious by analyzing social structures .",
    "what does `` structure '' mean in the original sense ?",
    "on the one hand we have our conventional understanding of structure  the understanding of structure in our real life . on the other",
    "we may formulate a precise idea of structure in terms of mathematics , in system theory @xcite and in the theory of selforganization @xcite :    `` we understand under a `` structure '' the composition of elements and the set of relations respectively operations , which connect the elements . ''",
    "krber @xcite writes about the idea of structure in real systems : `` each system consists of elements that are arranged in a certain way and are linked to each other by relations .",
    "we understand by structure of a system the kind of arrangement and connections of their elements  in this respect , we do not consider what kind the elements are .",
    "if we speak about structure , we are not interested in the elements of the structure .",
    "we only consider the manifold of relations . in this respect",
    "the structure of a system is a well - defined connection between the elements of the system .",
    "these elements , which are arranged in a determined manner and connected by determined connections can be necessary or randomly , universally or uniquely , relevant or irrelevant ''",
    ".    moles @xcite writes to this subject : `` the surrounding objects of the material world , artifical and natural organism in the wide sense of this world are signed by two main aspects ; by their structural and functional properties . ''    with the famous book series `` the elements of mathematics '' the group of scientists , bourbaki , gave an example for constructing systematically mathematics as a science of such `` structures '' . in the following section we give a short description of several important concepts of this mathematical theory of structures .",
    "in particular , we give a summary of the theory of relation , graphs and matrices in the amount we need here .",
    "our purpose is to apply this abstract theory to socio - economic networks .    in a socio - economic system ,",
    "the elements of structure are individuals or groups of individuals in different institutional and organizational forms , e.g. , firms .",
    "the socio - economic connections between these elements are relations in the sense of this abstract theory of structure .",
    "the description of elements and relations can be given graphically by a system of vertices ( nodes ) , which model the elements ( individuals , groups , firms ) and of edges ( arcs ) , which describe the relations ( connections ) .",
    "nodes and arcs can be weighted .",
    "arcs can have a direction .",
    "this way we can include quantitative aspects .",
    "the most important aspect in the selforganization of networks is the formation of new connections , which generates new structures . in the following ,",
    "we want to show that the instruments of the mathematical theory of structure in connection with the ideas and concepts of the theory of selforganization contribute to the description of the connections in complex socio - economic networks .",
    "the idea of `` structure '' stands in a close connection to order ( disorder ) respectively information ( entropy ) .",
    "the theory of selforganization shows how the generation of structures is connected with the decrease of entropy @xcite .",
    "socio - economic systems are complex systems , which consist of many connections between the elements .",
    "therefore , complexity is a further concept to be defined .",
    "ebeling , freund and schweitzer @xcite write :    `` as complex we describe holistic structures consisting of many components , which are connected by many ( hierarchically ordered ) relations respectively operations .",
    "the complexity of a structure can be seen in the number of equal respectively distinct elements , in the number of equal respectively distinct relations and operations , as well as in the number of hierarchical levels . in the stricter sense",
    ", complexity requires that the number of elements becomes very large ( practically infinite ) . ''",
    "we are especially interested here in the origin of complex structures , and in the development of order ( information ) . in the end",
    "we have to answer the question which parameter - relations ( order parameters ) determine the qualitative behaviour of the system .",
    "ilya prigogine @xcite in collaboration with his coworkers , did pioneering work in the investigation of selforganizing systems . @xcite",
    "further important work has been done in this field by manfred eigen @xcite on the selforganization of macromolecules and by manfred eigen and peter schuster @xcite on the hypercycle model .",
    "the mechanisms of selforganization are clearly worked out by nicolis and prigogine @xcite .",
    "these authors give a stringent physical and mathematical formulation for these processes , in particular with respect to the energetic and entropic aspects . a somewhat different view on this was developed in the formulation of the synergetics by haken @xcite .",
    "the investigation of such systems shows that the formation of order in complex systems can be allocated to physical processes which play a role far from equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we underline that biological , just as socio - economic processes , can be investigated with the help of the theory of selforganization because they obey the valid physical and chemical laws .",
    "however , processes which include the real life ( biological and socio - economic systems ) also obey other rules and laws , which are not solely determined by physics .",
    "this is already evident from the very general character of the structures we consider here .",
    "as said above , we formulate the idea of structure mathematically and keep away from how the structure appears in different systems .",
    "then , graph theory will provide us with the level of abstraction we need in order to describe real systems .      by formulating our ideas in the mathematical language",
    ", we have the advantage of having access to the great mathematical potential which is available in this field .",
    "an important basic assumption is to start from the theory of sets . as pointed out above",
    ", the connection between element and set is the first and most important aspect of a structure .",
    "furthermore , we introduce relations and operations .",
    "the concept of structure reflects abstract properties of a system . due to the abstract character of the concept",
    ", results can be translated to other systems and comparisons are possible .    in general we can differ between local , temporal , causal and functional structures . to illustrate the structures we will use graphs which represent the elements and their connections by geometrical symbols @xcite .",
    "an example of a graph representing an economic network with 4 levels is given in fig .",
    "this graph represents the flow of materials and outcomes in a production process .    in economics ,",
    "the relations between economic agents can be represented in a network form . in",
    "this case information flows , e.g. , price signals between market participants , are exchanged .",
    "then , the structure of the network describes a situation with local interaction ( not every agent is informed about all other agents but the agents also do not act independently ) @xcite .",
    "socio - economic networks can also describe a variety of different agents actions that influence other agents .",

    "we now introduce several important terms that characterize a network , following in part the work mentioned above .",
    "if @xmath5 is the number of edges in the graph , and @xmath49 is the number of vertices , we denote the considered graph by @xmath50 . as a simple and important measure , the connectivity is defined as : @xmath51 isolated , connected parts of the digraph @xmath50 consisting of @xmath2 vertices and @xmath19 arcs are called components @xmath52 . let us note here that the `` basic step in the structural description of a network is to identify the number and size of its components '' @xcite , p.  102 .",
    "socio - economically interpreted , the existence , number and size of components in a graph stands for the opportunities and obstacles to communicate , to exchange information or / and to interact .",
    "@xmath53 is the number of components with @xmath2 vertices and @xmath19 arcs .",
    "so we can write : @xmath54 we denote the mean values of the frequency of the component @xmath52 by : @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the probability that in a special digraph @xmath50 @xmath57 components @xmath52 can occur",

    "@xmath63 the probabilities for the emergence of different finite large components are uncorrelated , so we have to work with a poisson distribution for the possibility of @xmath64 components with @xmath2 vertices and @xmath19 arcs in the whole graph @xcite : @xmath65     for @xmath66 that @xmath64 components @xmath67 occur ]    in dependence on @xmath68 we can for instance represent @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 over @xmath64 .",
    "so we can show the building of components in dependence on the connectivity @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .    following sonntag , feistel",
    ", ebeling @xcite we can achieve further statements . in the limit",
    "@xmath63 the mean number of components @xmath73 in practice is determined only by semicycleless components ( trees ) .",
    "so we can use the approximation : @xmath74 in that limit @xmath63 the number of non - trivial components : @xmath75 follows .    by a constant number of @xmath49 of individuals , firms ( vertices ) the building of relations between these individuals , firms corresponds to an increasing number @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath5 is proportional to @xmath68 : @xmath76 in such a way , and intuitively clear , the connectivity @xmath68 increases during the development of relations .",

    "great and strong connected components @xmath52 are of interest .",
    "this means that a great number of relations exists @xmath77 , so that the components are strong connected .",
    "strong connected components are characterized by the appearance of cycles .",

    "the probability is zero , that from a vertex a cycle goes out .",
    "for @xmath88 the probability increases up to the value one .",

    "for @xmath89 the graphs @xmath50 consist of one great component . for @xmath89 with growing @xmath68 value , one tree after the other is `` absorbed '' by the great component . with an increasing number of arcs",
    "ever more trees are linked up with one great component until , finally , all vertices are linked with each other ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the number of components in directed graphs also corresponds to the value given by erds and rnyi @xcite for undirected graphs ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) : @xmath90     of a graph in dependence on @xmath68 ]    for the examination of the development of socio - economic connections , it is interesting to inspect the share of the graph , that is structured . if we consider a network build from firms the number of the isolated vertices ( firms ) can be determined .",
    "in particular , they are those which do not belong to the connection net . in the same way , the number of components ( without isolated vertices ) can be obtained .",
    "this is the part of the graph that includes the economic or knowledge exchange network .",
    "if we understand economic connections as a manifold of possibilities , we can arrive at some conclusions .",
    "in particular , we will observe the network of interaction between firms over time .",
    "we keep the number of firms ( vertices ) in the network constant and let the connections between them develop , i.e. @xmath5 , the number of edges , will increase . on the other side",
    "@xmath5 is proportional to @xmath68 . in accordance to intuition",
    ", the connectivity rises if connections develop .",
    "as the calculation shows , at first the number of the little components rises and then it decreases with the further rising of @xmath68 .",
    "the number of the great components rises up to the moment when all are absorbed in one . inside this great component",
    "the degree of connectedness of the network plays a role .",
    "a sign for this strong connectedness is the occurrence of cycle in the graph .",
    "as we have shown , the frequency of cycles of the length @xmath78 is a simple function of the connectivity @xmath68 .",
    "likewise , the probability can be given that a cycle comes from a vertex .",
    "for @xmath92 the probability is zero , that means that the number of the vertices is unimportant . by a rising development of connections ( @xmath93 )",
    "this probability rises up to 1 .",
    "these findings have consequences for the development of information flows in growing socio - economic networks .",
    "the question is if a certain type of developing connections can also be observed in empirical data about information flows .",
    "for instance , inside or between organizations of firms .",
    "one possible method to trace information inside of organizations is the use of e - mail traffic . in a recent paper tyler , wilkinson and",
    "huberman @xcite used e - mail data to map the communication network inside an industrial organization . in this case",
    "the nodes represent people and the connections between them are given by e - mail correspondence .",
    "they identified components of different size and interpreted the smaller components as expressions of communities in practice .",
    "as far as they reported , the structure of the e - mail networks shows similarities to the structure of the organization .",
    "in addition , leadership roles can be identified this way . to relate such empirical observations to the results repeated above",
    ", one would need to look at the temporal evolution of components and connectivity in time .",
    "another recent approach using percolation theory to describe socio - economic change was proposed by silverberg and co - authors @xcite .",
    "starting with a space of discrete technologies which have a certain performance , they looked for spanning connected paths in this technological landscape . in this picture",
    ", invention can be visualized as isolated islands located ahead of a technological frontier which moves forward . under the critical value",
    "there will only be finite connected sets ( clusters or components ) of different technologies , and technological change might come to an end .",
    "if we remember that firms are the carriers for different technologies , there is a direct link to the concept of a network of firms exchanging information about different technologies and doing search processes in such an abstract technological space .",
    "then , the different components would be related to groups of firms sharing certain technological knowledge or being part of one chain of production .",
    "the increase in connectivity characterizes the diffusion of a certain technology in a specific industrial sector or across sectors .",
    "if we consider a firm , and do not look at the whole graph , additional aspects can be included : if we understand the concept of the economic connections as a sum of abilities which the firm has acquired , we can write in simple terms :    competence @xmath94 of the abilities    if a firm or plant creates a new economic connection , it can be in interaction with others . in the picture of the graph",

    "economic growth is characterized by structural changes based on the introduction of new technologies in the economic world . to describe technological evolution",
    ", one has to determine the system , the elements and their interactions .",
    "here we consider plants and technologies .",
    "we consider firms composed from different plants .",
    "the plants are introduced as elementary units which play the role of decision carriers according to market conditions ( choosing a new technology or not ) .",
    "plants also play the role of users of a particular technology .",
    "the technologies are understood as the different types present in the system .",
    "the plants are the elements or representatives of these technologies . in this perspective , eventually technologies are competing for plants using them .",
    "this perspective differs from the way one usually thinks about technological change , where the firm is central .",
    "the underlying process is still a decision made by plants or firms .",
    "however , the model approach constructs an inverse perspective on it .",
    "let us note here that this perspective is quite normal for any population dynamic approach which deals with types ( groups or species ) and elements ( individuals ) .",
    "however , in contrast to biological processes , human beings , organizations and firms are not bound to a certain type or group they first belong to .",
    "in contrast to individuals of biological species they have the opportunity to change the group they belong to . it is this kind of transition behaviour that makes the model particularly relevant for socio - economic applications .",
    "let us note further that we deliberately use the notion of a plant or production unit as the simplest element in the system . by assuming that firms consist of several plants or production units , growth processes of firms are also covered by the model approach .",
    "technological change is usually considered as a macroeconomic change process .",
    "however , in order to describe it as an evolutionary process , one has to consider this process at the microscopic level .",
    "this means we have to consider the microeconomic carriers of technological changes . in the framework we present here , these are the plants @xcite .",
    "the basic ideas for the modelling of these processes go back to so - called urn - models . already in 1907",

    "kohlrausch and schrdinger @xcite gave a continuous diffusion - approximation for such processes .",
    "feller @xcite formulated a realistic variant of this model .",
    "he used a discrete markovian process with continuous time .",
    "the time between the molecule crossings was exponentially distributed .",
    "originally developed for molecular processes , the model soon found many applications to biological processes .",

    "their addition or removal drastically changes the properties of the whole system .",
    "another problem where stochastic effects play a big role is the question of how a single new mutant can win the selection process . if one considers networks of web sites and competition processes between them about attracting visitors one would ask how can a new web site become a giant cluster among other already important web sites ( clusters ) ?",

    "cellular networks can be subject to random errors as a result of mutations or protein misfolding , as well as harsh external conditions eliminating essential metabolites .",
    "jeong et al .",
    "@xcite studied the responses of the metabolic networks of several organisms to random and preferential node removal . removing up to 8% of the substrates",
    ", they found that the average path length did not increase when nodes were removed randomly .",
    "however , it increases rapidly after the removal of the most - connected nodes and up to 500% when only 8% of the nodes are removed .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the protein network of yeast as well @xcite .",
    "sol and montoya @xcite studied the response of the food webs to the removal of species ( nodes ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the results indicate that random species removal causes the fraction of species contained in the largest cluster to decrease linearly . however , when the most connected ( keystone ) species are successively removed , the relative size of the largest cluster quickly decays .",
    "the error and attack tolerance of the internet and the world wide web was investigated by albert , jeong and barabsi @xcite .",
    "the internet is occasionally subject to hacker attacks targeting some of the most connected nodes .",
    "they show that the average path length on the internet is unaffected by the random removal of as many as 60% of the nodes , while if the most connected nodes are eliminated ( attack ) , the average path length peaks at a very small fraction of removed nodes .",
    "albert , jeong and barabsi investigated the world wide web @xcite and showed that the network survives as a large cluster under high rates of failure , but under attack , the system abruptly crashes .",
    "these authors write : `` the result is that scale - free networks display a high degree of robustness against random errors , coupled with a susceptibility to attacks . ''",
    "wagner and fell @xcite studied the clustering coefficient , focusing on the energy and biosynthesis metabolism of the escherichia coli bacterium .",
    "they found that in addition to the power - law degree distribution , the undirected version of this substrate graph has a small average path length and a large clustering coefficient .",
    "bianconi and barabsi @xcite showed the existence of a closed link between evolving networks and an equilibrium bose gas . according to them ,",
    "the mapping to a bose gas predicts the existence of two distinct phases as a function of the energy distribution . in the fit - get - rich - phase",
    ", the fitter nodes acquire edges at a higher rate than older but less fit nodes . in the end , the fittest node will have the most edges , but the richest node is not an absolute winner , since its share of the edges decays to zero for large system size .    maurer and huberman @xcite present a dynamic model of web site growth in order to explore the effects of competition among web sites .",
    "they show that under general conditions , as the competition between sites increases , the model exhibits a sudden transition from a regime in which many sites thrive simultaneously , to a `` winner takes all market '' in which a few sites grab almost all the users , while most other sites become nearly extinct .",

    "dorogovtsev , mendes and samukhin @xcite developed a statistical mechanic approach for random networks .",
    "they summarize : `` using the traditional formalism of statistical mechanics , we have constructed a set of equilibrium statistical ensembles of random networks without correlation and have found their partition function and main characteristics .",
    "we have shown that a `` scale - free '' state in equilibrium networks without condensate may exist only in a single marginal point , so that in such an event this state is an exhibition . ''",
    "they underline the important fact that this differs crucially from the situation for growing networks .",
    "the latter , while growing , self - organize into scale - free structures in a wide range of parameters without condensation .        the stochastic approach given here",
    "is based on a model , which was developed in the context of general models of evolutionary processes , and in particular biochemical processes @xcite .",
    "later , the model found numerous applications in modelling scientific evolution @xcite and technological evolution @xcite . in this paper , we first introduce the model framework in a general form and later concentrate on its application to economic innovation and competition processes .",
    "in the stochastic picture we use the ideas developed in subsection [ sec1.1 ] and in the subsection [ sec3.1.1 ] about the occupation number space .",
    "opposite to the deterministic models , the stochastic description offers the advantage that at finite times new types ( sorts , fields , species , technologies ) can arise or `` die out '' .",

    "however , let us note here that the original formulation of the ehrenfest model only contains transition processes .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the ehrenfest model the total number of elements remains constant and only exchange between the urns occurs .",
    "decision processes in the model occur as transitions of elements between types .",
    "if we assume that all decisions leading to a change of the set of the occupation numbers depend mostly on the present state , we can apply the concept of markov process .",

    "the decay can appear in the form of spontaneous decay ( @xmath123 ) and of decay related to catalytic help ( @xmath124 ) .",

    "we first discuss structural ( static ) properties of such a relational network . in this way ,",
    "instruments from random graph theory and percolation theory become relevant . in particular , formulae for the probabilities of the occurrence and the distribution of components and cycles in large networks",
    "have been obtained by combinatorial considerations .",
    "we show that connectivity is a central measure in the structure of these kinds of networks .",
    "evolving , dynamic networks show different phenomena compared to random graphs .",
    "the results better correspond to findings in real data of empirical networks such as the appearance of power law distributions of the degree function .    in the centre of the paper we turn to the discussion towards the dynamic properties of networks .",
    "in particular , we derive descriptions for a network of interacting technologies and interacting firms .",
    "we call these networks sensitive because innovation processes described in terms of the removal or appearance of a node might change the dynamic behaviour of the system dramatically .",
    "we use a stochastic description of such an evolving network and base this on the theory of birth and death processes .",
    "we introduce different forms of transition probabilities for closed systems as well as for open , growing and declining systems .",
    "we define master equations and non - linear differential equations as their deterministic equivalents .",
    "contrary to deterministic models , the stochastic description offers the advantage that , at finite times , new technologies ( types ) can arise or `` die out '' .",
    "further , the emergence of an innovation can be treated as a singular stepwise event implying the transition from an under - occupied to an occupied state .    in some special cases",
    "the master equation can be solved analytically and a stationary survival probability for an innovation can be derived .",
    "we show that the stochastic dynamics differ essentially from the deterministic .",
    "separatrices , which decompose the phase space , can not be intersected in the deterministic case . in the stochastic case",
    "they can be crossed .",
    "this way , a `` once - for - ever '' or hyperselection that is known in economics as lock - in phenomena for technologies can be avoided .",
    "the stochastic model of networked dynamic interactions of technologies is further generalized in a multi - dimensional case .",
    "processes representing different non - linearities are discussed in the context of technological change .",
    "although we use technological evolution as main reference point , we also point to the fact that the modular structure of the model also allows for its application in quite different fields .",
    "applications in fields as biology , population theory and science of science have been presented @xcite .",
