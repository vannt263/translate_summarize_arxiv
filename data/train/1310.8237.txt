    "<S> it constitutes a striking realization of a key problem in statistical physics which in a much broader context aims at determining the response of a medium to a perturbation created by a driven tp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a considerable amount of knowledge has been gathered on the forms of the so - called force - velocity relation , that being , the dependence of the tp velocity @xmath0 on the value of the applied force @xmath1 , both in the linear and the non - linear response regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> behavior beyond the force - velocity relation was recently addressed numerically in the pioneering work @xcite , which studied via molecular dynamics simulations the dynamics of an externally driven , or biased tp in a glass - forming liquid ( a dense binary yukawa liquid ) . </S>",

    "<S> this effect was found _ only _ in the close vicinity of the glass transition while regular diffusion was recovered away from the transition @xcite , suggesting that such anomalous behavior could be a distinct feature of being close to the glass transition .    </S>",
    "<S> a number of attempts has been made to explain these findings , based either on a random trap model @xcite , mode coupling theory @xcite or continuous - time random walks ( ctrws ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these approaches rely on the notion of a complex energy landscape and thereby assume that the system is close to the glass transition . however </S>",
    "<S> , they do not provide a quantitative nor qualitative understanding of the superdiffusive behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the question whether superdiffusion is the ultimate regime or only a transient is still open @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that in fact superdiffusion in active microrheology settings can appear away from the glass transition , and even _ independently _ of glassy properties . based on a simple model that does not involve any complex energy landscape or kinetic constraints , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that superdiffusion emerges universally in confined crowded systems . </S>",
    "<S> we fully quantify this superdiffusion , show that it is long - lived , highlight the key role of the system s geometry , and provide a clear physical mechanism underlying such behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is a minimal model of a crowded system in which the motion of particles and of the tp is mediated by so - called `` diffusive '' packing defects , or vacancies that are sufficiently large in size to allow their diffusive motion to proceed through direct swapping of their positions with the host medium particles . </S>",

    "<S> the tp is released from the cage when a defect arrives to its location .    , and thus has asymmetric hopping probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows of different size depict schematically the hopping probabilities ; a larger arrow near the tp indicates that it has a preference for moving in the direction of the applied field . </S>",

    "<S> the tp performs a random walk biased by an external applied force @xmath11 ( see figure [ model ] and the si for a detailed description of the dynamics ) , hindered by hard - core interactions with the host particles . </S>",
    "<S> note that this description represents a combination of two paradigmatic models of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics : asymmetric ( for the tp ) and symmetric ( for the host particles ) simple exclusion processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> until now , only the force - velocity relation has been analyzed for such a model @xcite , with the exception of single file systems for which the variance has been calculated @xcite and infinite 2d systems , where however only a particular limit of the variance was considered @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as noticed in @xcite for two - dimensional systems , an important technical point is that in the absence of driving force and for small values of the density of vacancies @xmath9 , the dynamics of the tp can be deduced from analysing the joint dynamics of the tp and a single isolated vacancy . as a matter of fact , this is still true for a biased tp in any dimension . in the si </S>",

    "<S> ( [ general])).,width=340 ]    a number of important conclusions can be drawn from this result : ( i ) strong superdiffusion with exponent @xmath33 takes place in confined , quasi-1d geometries , those being , infinitely long 3d capillaries and 2d stripes . </S>",
    "<S> this result is quite counterintuitive : indeed , in the absence of driving force it is common to encounter diffusive , or even subdiffusive growth of the fluctuations of the tp position in such crowded molecular environments @xcite , however not superdiffusion ; ( ii ) the superdiffusion in such systems emerges beyond ( and therefore can not be reproduced within ) the linear response - based approaches : the prefactor in the superdiffusive law is proportional to @xmath34 when @xmath35 . despite the presence of the superdiffusion , the einstein relation is nonetheless valid for systems of arbitrary geometry due to subdominant ( in time ) terms whose prefactor is proportional to @xmath18 ; ( iii ) in unbounded 3d systems @xmath12 grows diffusively and not superdiffusively ; ( iv ) for @xmath36 ( single files ) , one finds @xmath37 , so that @xmath38 , and no super - diffusion can take place , in agreement with @xcite . as a matter of fact , in this case the variance grows sub - diffusively . finally , this shows that superdiffusion is geometry - induced and the recurrence of the random walk performed by a vacancy is a necessary but not sufficient condition in order for superdiffusion to occur .    _ giant diffusion regime . _ the exact analytical result in eq.([general ] ) provides explicit criteria for superdiffusion to occur . </S>",
    "<S> technically , this yields the behavior of the variance when the limit @xmath39 is taken before the large-@xmath5 limit . </S>",
    "<S> it however does not allow us , due to the nature of the limits involved , to answer the question whether the superdiffusion is the ultimate regime ( or just a transient ) , which requires the determination of @xmath40 at fixed @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we find that the order in which these limits are taken is crucial in confined geometries ( @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the effective bias experienced by a vacancy between two consecutive interactions with the tp , originating from a non zero velocity of the tp , dramatically affects the ultimate long - time behavior of the variance in confined geometries .    </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we show ( see the si ) that the superdiffusive regime is always transient for an experimentally relevant system with @xmath9 fixed , while the long - time behaviour obeys @xmath42\\rho_0   & \\text{3d lattice } , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] i.e. , is always diffusive . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath43 depends on the driving force @xmath18 and on the geometry ( quasi-1d in this case ) of the system ( see the si ) . </S>",
    "<S> this long - time diffusive behaviour has several remarkable features : in dense quasi-1d systems the variance is independent of @xmath9 , meaning that the corresponding longitudinal diffusion coefficient @xmath44 is enhanced in comparison to the transverse one @xmath45 by a factor @xmath46 , which may attain giant values in systems with @xmath47 . in 2d this effect is negligible and @xmath44 is only a factor @xmath48 larger than @xmath45 . in unbounded 3d systems </S>",
    "<S> no such strong anisotropy between @xmath44 and @xmath45 will emerge .    </S>",
    "<S> _ full dynamics : scaling regime and cross - over . _ </S>",
    "<S> finally , our approach provides the complete time evolution of the variance in the regime corresponding to @xmath49 and at a sufficiently large time @xmath5 , that interpolates between the two limiting regimes of superdiffusion and giant diffusion listed above . in this regime </S>",

    "<S> figure ( [ time ] ) reveals excellent quantitative agreement between the analytical predictions and the numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> several comments are in order : ( i ) equation ( [ allregimes ] ) encompasses both limiting behaviors ( [ general ] ) and ( [ largetime ] ) , and shows explicitly that the limits @xmath54 and @xmath55 in quasi-1d and 2d systems do not commute ; ( ii ) in such systems the superdiffusion persists up until the onset of the giant diffusive behaviour at times @xmath56 , which can be very large when @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> superdiffusion is therefore very long - lived in such systems . despite its transient feature , we thus expect superdiffusion to be a robust characteristic of confined crowded systems and we anticipate that the ultimate diffusive behavior might be in practice difficult to observe .     on stripe - like lattices ( @xmath57 ) for different densities ; solid line : @xmath58 , see the si . </S>",

    "<S> the model can then be reformulated as an effective ctrw that takes into account _ </S>",
    "<S> explicitly _ the dynamics of the diffusive vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the ctrw approach presented in @xcite for glassy systems , which infers the mean and the variance of the waiting - time distribution from the numerical data . in the quasi-1d case , </S>",
    "<S> the waiting time of the first jump of the tp is extracted from the distribution @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the well - known survival probability of an immobile target in a sea of diffusing predators @xmath65 @xcite . waiting times of subsequent jumps </S>",
    "<S> are then drawn from the distribution @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the survival probability of an immobile target chased by a single random walker that starts near the target @xcite . using the waiting time distribution described here , </S>",
    "<S> standard calculations ( described in the si ) show that : ( i ) super - diffusion with an exponent @xmath68 appears as a result of repeated interactions between the tp and a _ single _ vacancy in quasi-1d systems . </S>",
