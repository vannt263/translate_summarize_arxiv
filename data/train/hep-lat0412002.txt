    "experimentalists are often able to tell us several properties of a given meson , such as its energy , width and angular momentum .",
    "however , usually they can not tell us the structure of the meson .",
    "for example , with @xmath1 states  the topic of interest here  they can not say whether these states are @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 . unfortunately , when theoreticians try to describe @xmath1 states , they have to decide beforehand the state structure to be used in some model , which often has sufficient freedom to fit the data with any of the possible structures . in an attempt to clarify the experiment @xmath5 theory comparison , we suggest the use of lattice qcd . in principle",
    ", lattice qcd should give us all we need to know about @xmath1 states .",
    "however , in practice , the results need to be corrected for the lattice spacing ( @xmath6 ) , finite lattice size ( @xmath7 ) and quark mass ( @xmath8 ) effects  but these are usually under control and with the advent of more computer resources they will decrease in importance .",
    "the strategy followed here is to concentrate on the simplest of quark states , namely , the @xmath9 system , where @xmath10 is an infinitely heavy quark ( _ i.e. _ static ) and @xmath11 is a quark with about the strange quark mass .",
    "this system is sufficiently simple to enable state - of - the - art lattice calculations to generate much more `` data '' than can be achieved by direct experiment .",
    "this data consists of the ground state energies of s- , p- and d - wave states and also the spin average f - wave energy @xcite .",
    "not only are the ground state energies extracted , but also those of the corresponding excited states containing at least one radial node . in addition , the vector ( charge ) and scalar ( matter ) radial distributions of these states can be measured .",
    "this is an abundance of data , far beyond what has been done experimentally in the @xmath1 meson .",
    "given all this data the challenge is now for theorists to make models to explain it . in this quest",
    "there are two simplifications .",
    "firstly , since @xmath10 is static , the system is essentially reduced to a one - body problem involving only the light quark @xmath12 . secondly , in the lattice calculations , since the energies and radial distributions are extracted from @xmath9 correlations propagating in euclidean time , it is expected that the resultant states are indeed @xmath9 states with little contamination from other possible multiquark components .",
    "support for this expectation ( hope ) is seen in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "there a @xmath13 correlation generates a linearly rising potential for interquark distances far larger than expected _",
    "i.e. _ way beyond where @xmath14 configurations should appear through string breaking . to see this effect the explicit introduction of @xmath14 correlations is needed @xcite .",
    "the `` data base '' for properties of @xmath9 states measured on lattices is so far incomplete . in ref",
    ".  @xcite we concentrated on the s - wave energies and radial distributions .",
    "the latter showed two distinct features .",
    "firstly , the excited state distributions exhibited nodes as expected . secondly , the charge distribution ( @xmath15 ) was of longer range than the matter distribution ( @xmath16 ) but with @xmath17 .",
    "this is readily explained by the one - body dirac equation , since there @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where for s - waves @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 becoming comparable for large @xmath23 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the data base was extended to include the energies of the excited states @xmath24 and @xmath25 and also the spin averaged combinations @xmath26 and @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is the @xmath29-wave state with @xmath30 , since the spin of the @xmath10 does not play a dynamical role . in this note",
    "we return to measuring the charge and matter distributions as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but concentrate on the @xmath28-state and its excitations .",
    "this state is of particular interest , since  as shown in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite  the indications are that the predicted @xmath31 is below the @xmath32-threshold and so should be very narrow as was found for the @xmath33 counterpart .",
    "the outcome is seen in figs .  1 for the ground state distributions @xmath34 and the off - diagonal distributions between the ground state and the first excited state @xmath35 .",
    "the latter show single nodes as expected from a first excited state .",
    "however , @xmath34 shows two features which at first sight seem surprising :    \\1 ) the distributions are _ finite _ at @xmath36 , even though they are @xmath29-waves .",
    "\\2 ) the matter distribution has a _ node _ , even though it involves only the ground state .",
    "but again this is precisely what one expects from solutions of the dirac equation , where for the @xmath28-state both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are _ non - zero _ at @xmath36 and , furthermore , the `` small '' component @xmath38 can be _ larger _ than @xmath37 at small @xmath23 . in figs .  2",
    "the above data , now with a factor of @xmath39 included , are compared with the dirac distributions using a quark mass of 100 mev and an interquark potential @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42=1.3 gev / fm .",
    "these three parameters are very sensible and were not tuned to get an optimal fit .",
    "charge and matter distributions for @xmath43 and @xmath44.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]     and @xmath28 radial distributions from fig .  1 compared with dirac equation fits.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]",
    "the s- and p - wave charge and matter distributions in figs .",
    "2 suggest that they can be understood qualitatively in terms of the one - body dirac equation .",
    "the challenge is now to see to what extent there is an analogous _ quantitative _ description of the energies and distributions of all the s- , p- , d- and f - wave states  both ground and excited , when they become available .",
    "it is possible that the strategy used in studying the @xmath45-potential is appropriate , namely , to first concentrate on the higher partial waves and so avoid or reduce complications , such as the effect of form factors needed to regulate the one - gluon - exchange potential and also instanton - induced interactions , that enter at small values of @xmath23 .",
    "the authors wish to thank the center for scientific computing in espoo , finland and the ulgrid project of the university of liverpool for making available ample computer resources .",
    "two of us , amg and jk , acknowledge support by the academy of finland contract 54038 and the eu grant hprn - ct-2002 - 00311 euridice .",
