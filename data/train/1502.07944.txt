    "proper laser arrangements have been used to induce artificial magnetic fields and spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent experiments have demonstrated the creation of synthetic magnetism in 2d optical lattices  @xcite , and realized the meissner - superfluid  ( msf ) to vortex - superfluid  ( vsf ) transition  @xcite with bosons in square optical ladders  @xcite .",
    "however , in all these experiments the fields created were static since there was no feedback of the atoms on the field .",
    "nevertheless , such a dynamical feedback plays an important role in various areas of physics , ranging from condensed - matter  @xcite to quantum chromodynamics  @xcite . in order to experimentally simulate such dynamical gauge fields in optical lattices various ideas",
    "have been recently suggested @xcite .",
    "while in those kind of dynamical gauge fields it is crucial to discriminate particle and gauge fields degrees of freedom , gauge fields determined by the particle density appear in a variety of problems in condensed - matter physics , including effective field theories for the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite and their extension to generalized statistics in one dimension  @xcite , spin models of quantum magnetism  @xcite , and chiral solitons  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the atomic back - action on the synthetic gauge field in cold gases experiments is expected to lead to these last type of excitations in bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .    from the experimental standpoint , raman - assisted hopping of cold atoms  @xcite",
    "can be used in 1d optical lattices to realize occupation - dependent gauge fields that result in effective anyon statistics and thus a clean experimental realization of a 1d _ anyon_-hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "this model presents a wealth of new physics , including statistically - induced phase transitions  @xcite , novel superfluid phases  @xcite , asymmetric momentum distributions  @xcite , and intriguing dynamics  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show how a raman - laser scheme can be employed for the realization of density - dependent synthetic magnetism ( ddsm ) in one and two dimensions and study its effects in ladder and square lattice geometries .",
    "in particular , we are interested in a system described by the following hamiltonian @xmath0   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{u}{2}\\sum_{{\\mathbf r } } n_{{\\mathbf r}}(n_{{\\mathbf r}}-1 ) - \\mu\\sum_{\\mathbf{r } } n_\\mathbf{r } , \\label{eq : heff-2d_gen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is a bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator acting on site @xmath3 of the lattice , and @xmath4 is the number operator .",
    "as it will be discussed below , the experimental implementation leads to a three - body hardcore constraint on the onsite occupation , i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "the first term in ( @xmath6 ) accounts for the hopping of bosons along the two directions of the lattice , defined by lattice vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while the second and third terms account for the usual onsite hubbard interaction and the chemical potential which fixes the total density of the system , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]  ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "as it will be shown below , the density dependent peierls phase of the hopping amplitude @xmath9 can be chosen in such a way that an effective net - magnetic flux per unit - cell is created . in particular , we will concentrate in the case were the phases depend only on the position in the @xmath10-direction , i.e. @xmath11 . due to the operator nature of this phase , quantum fluctuations of the density will crucially affect the effective magnetic flux . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that ddsm has important consequences for bosons in two - leg ladders and 2d square lattices , leading to a non - trivial interplay between chirality and density modulations .",

    ", this interplay results in a density - driven meissner - superfluid  ( msf )  vortex - superfluid  ( vsf ) transition with a non - trivial density imbalance between the legs . in square lattices ddsm induces a similar transition between a non - chiral superfluid  ( sf ) and a chiral superfluid  ( csf ) , both presenting a non - trivial density - wave amplitude .",

    "i.e. @xmath296 , for which the peierls phase in hamiltonian   takes the simpler form , @xmath297 despite this simplification , the peierls phase of the hopping along the @xmath17-direction still rends the 2d model ( [ eq : heff-2d_gen ] ) to be intrinsically frustrated and thus highly non - trivial to approach from a computational perspective . in the following , we will use the composite boson mean - field theory ( cbmft )  @xcite , which is a useful tool to unveil strongly correlated phases of spin and boson lattice models where other methods face significant problems .",
    "cbmft is based on the use of clusters of the original degrees of freedom as the basic degrees of freedom that contain the necessary quantum correlations to describe the phases emerging in the system under study . in practice , we tile the lattice into clusters of equal size , in such a way that each site @xmath298 of the original 2d lattice belongs to a unique cluster .",
    "the tiling is performed preserving most of the symmetries of the model .",
    "each quantum state of each cluster can be represented by the action of a creation _",
    "composite boson _ ( cb ) over a cb vacuum .",
    "being the mapping relating the original bosons @xmath299 to the new cbs canonical @xcite , one can rewrite ( [ eq : heff-2d_gen ] ) in terms of cbs and approach it by standard many - body techniques , with the advantage that short - range quantum correlations are exactly computed by construction .    here",
    "we will use the cb gutzwiller ansatz , a simplest product of uncorrelated cluster wave functions , @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the creation cb associated to the cluster @xmath302 in the state @xmath303 , where @xmath304 refers to a cluster configuration in the occupation basis .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath305 are then determined upon variational minimization of the energy . in the homogeneus case , i.e. @xmath306 , this variational determination is equivalent to exactly diagonalize a unique cluster with open boundary conditions and a set of self - consistently defined mean - fields acting on its borders @xcite .",
    "the cb gutzwiller ansatz ( [ eq : cb_gutz ] ) allows to compute observables and order parameters in a systematic way .",
    "in particular , the energy obtained is variational , and the ground state phase diagram can be obtained by monitoring the ground state energy and its derivatives . in addition , low lying excitations over the ground state can be analyzed within the cbmft framework self - consistently @xcite . nevertheless , this analysis is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "we define a @xmath307 charge density wave ( cdw ) order parameter , @xmath308 , which computed with an homogeneus cb gutzwiller ansatz @xmath309 takes the form , @xmath310    and the bond - chiral order parameter , @xmath311 where @xmath215 is the number of bonds , and the currents @xmath312 are defined through the continuity equation  .    figures  [ fig:2d ]  ( a ) and ( b ) show cbmft results of the ground - state phase diagram of eq .  ( [ eq : heff-2d_gen ] ) with @xmath295-phases and clusters of size @xmath313 .",
    "these sizes preserve the periodicity imposed by the peierls phase with effective @xmath295-flux . in order to enhance the non - trivial hopping of bosons along the @xmath17-direction we have set @xmath314 .    as we can see in figs .",
    "[ fig:2d ]  ( a ) and ( b ) , the system presents the usual mi lobes of integer density for small values of the hopping @xmath186 . for bigger values of the hopping ,",
    "the ground state presents superfluid order , characterized by a nonvanishing condensate density , @xmath315 ( not shown ) .",
    "in particular , a sf phase with modulated density and vanishing bond - chiral order emerges for @xmath316 , while for @xmath317 the ground state is a csf characterized by having nonvanishing bond currents in a pattern of fully stacked checkerboard pattern of vortices and anti - vortices  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ]  ( d ) ) .",
    "notice that the csf phase is nothing but a limiting case of the vsf previously described in the ladder case , when the vortices are of the size of a single plaquette in the square lattice .",
    "in addition , the csf has nonvanishing density modulations . were",
    "the peierls phase density - independent , all the superfluid region would have nonvanishing chiral order , and the density modulations would disappear ( not shown ) .",
    "thus , the density - dependence in the peierls phase has the effect of inducing finite density modulations and reducing the region with nonvanishing chiral order to that of @xmath317 .",
    "the phase transitions are in all cases found to be of second order , signaled by discontinuities in the second order derivative of the energy with respect to the chemical potential .",
    "the continuous vanishing of the bec order parameter ( sf - mi transition ) and the bond - chiral order @xmath318 ( csf - sf transition ) also supports this assumption .",
    "moreover , the phase diagram remains stable under increasing of the cluster size , as the cbmft-4@xmath3192 includes minor quantitative corrections to the phase borders of the cbmft-2@xmath3192 .",
    "in particular , the csf - sf phase boundary obtained with 2@xmath3192 and 2@xmath3194 basically overlap  ( figs .  [ fig:2d ]  ( a ) and ( b ) ) .    comparing the phase diagrams for the ladder  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) and the 2d square lattice  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] ) , we observe that the modulated sf can be considered as the bulk counterpart of the msf appearing in the ladder geometry .",
    "ddsm results in an intriguing dynamics that may be easily probed experimentally .",
    "we illustrate this point with the particular case of the ladder model   with @xmath249 and @xmath282 .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of a defect ( formed by either a doubly - occupied site , i.e. a doublon , or an empty site , i.e. a holon ) created in a mi with @xmath240 , initially at site @xmath320 .",
    "note that this initial condition is chosen for simplicity of the analysis .",
    "the initial doublon or holon may be created in a more delocalized region of the ladder .",
    "the relevant conclusions about the expansion dynamics would be unaffected .",

    "are irrelevant , and the defect expansion is like that of a single particle with a hopping @xmath186  ( @xmath322 ) for the holon  ( doublon ) . both holon and doublon propagate ballistically along the ladder , i.e. @xmath323  ( we consider below the time @xmath324 in units of @xmath325 for holons and @xmath326 for doublons ) .",
    "the expansion coefficient @xmath327 is however markedly different .",
    "holons do not experience any magnetic flux , and thus they propagate with a @xmath328-independent @xmath329 .",

    "a perturbative treatment of the role of particle - hole fluctuations offers an instructive starting point of the study .",

    "[ fig:4 ] for @xmath333 , for @xmath277 fluctuations speed up defect expansion ; the expansion coefficient may reach values @xmath345 .",
    "this is intuitively clear since there are more processes expanding the defect along the ladder .",
    "this remains true for small @xmath328 .",
    "however , the peculiar phase dependence of the extra terms  , modifies as well the effective magnetic flux experienced by the doublons . indeed , for a sufficient large @xmath328 , fluctuations slow down the doublon expansion , i.e. they strengthen the cyclotron motion diverting the doublon expansion , corresponding to an increase of the effective magnetic field experienced by the doublons .",
    "moreover , quantum fluctuations make holon expansion @xmath328dependent due to virtual doublons . for sufficiently large @xmath328 , fluctuations slow down the holon expansion , i.e. holons experience an effective cyclotron motion induced by quantum fluctuations of the mi substrate .",
