    "on1 is associated with the iras source 20081 + 3122 .",
    "it is believed that on1 contains a central binary massive protostar of type b0.3 surrounded by a young stellar cluster ( israel & wootten 1983 ; macleod et al . 1998 ; kumar et al .",

    "the 6.7-ghz methanol maser has an intrinsic relationship with high - mass star - formation , having to date been observed in exclusive association with known massive star - formation regions ( minier et al .",
    "methanol maser emission at 6668.512 mhz was first observed in on1 with the 43-m greenbank telescope in 1991 by menten , who detected a feature with a peak flux density of 91 jy at + 15.1 km s@xmath9 .",

    "6.7-ghz methanol maser polarization has only been studied twice previously , ellingsen ( 2002 ) found fractional polarizations between a few and 10 per cent in ngc6334f , whilst vlemmings , harvey - smith & cohen ( 2006a ) found approximately 2 per cent , with levels up to 8 per cent , in w3(oh ) .",
    "the methanol molecule is diamagnetic and as such has low magnetic permeability and a small magnetic dipole moment and so methanol masers in the presence of an external magnetic field are not expected to demonstrate strong linear polarization , nor to show large fractional circular polarization .    as the oh molecule is paramagnetic , oh masers are good tracers of the magnetic field .",
    "ground - state oh towards on1 was observed with merlin by nammahachak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . the 6-ghz excited - state of oh is also particularly effective for measuring the zeeman effect ( caswell & vaile 1995 ) .",
    "desmurs & baudry ( 1998 ) conducted vlbi observations of 6.035-ghz oh in on1 in 1994 , finding 4 right hand circularly polarized ( rhc ) features and 3 left hand circularly polarized ( lhc ) features , with flux densities ranging from 0.7 to 7.1 jy beam@xmath9 .",

    "this paper represents the first high resolution observations of 6.668-ghz methanol maser emission in on1 combined with the first detailed studies of the polarization properties of both the 6.668-ghz methanol and 6.031/6.035-ghz excited - state oh in on1 .",
    "unfortunately , the merlin results presented here did not have a wide enough bandwidth both to give adequate spectral resolution and to cover both features , so they were centred near the main peak shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "on1 was observed using the multi element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) on 2005 january 12 and 16 .",
    "these were the first data taken with new broadband 4 - 8 ghz e - merlin receivers on 5 telescopes ( the mkii , darnhall , tabley , knockin and cambridge ) , enough for full synthesis imaging , in full polarization .",

    "the longest baseline of merlin is 217 km , giving a synthesized beam size of 47 mas at 6.0 ghz and 43 mas at 6.7 ghz .",
    "spectral line data were taken using a 0.5 mhz bandwidth , centred on each line frequency corrected to a v@xmath18 of 12 km s@xmath9 , and split into 512 frequency channels .",
    "this gave a velocity span and resolution of 24.9 km s@xmath9 in 0.049 km s@xmath9 channels at 6.0 ghz and 22.5 km s@xmath9 in 0.044 km s@xmath9 channels at 6.7 ghz .",
    "to obtain all the stokes parameters , both right and left hand circularly polarized signals were collected from each telescope in the network .",
    "the phase reference source 2013 + 340 ( @xmath193@xmath3 from on1 ) was observed in continuum mode with 15 mhz useable bandwidth , for 2 min , before and after 7-min scans on on1 at each frequency .",
    "each line plus reference was observed in rotation , for a total of 5 hrs on on1 at each oh frequency and 3.5 hrs at the methanol frequency . 3c286 and",
    "3c84 were observed at all frequencies in both wide- and narrow - band configurations for totals of 6.0 and 9.2 hrs , respectively ( with an approximately even split in time between the configurations ) .    using local merlin software , the flux density of 3c84",
    "was established to be 15.5 jy with respect to the primary amplitude calibration source , 3c286 .",
    "the data were converted to fits files , using 3c84 to apply a preliminary bandpass scaling to all data .",
    "all further processing was performed using the astronomical image processing software ( aips ) , see the merlin user guide ( diamond et al .",
    "2003 ) for details .",
    "a small percentage of the data had anomalous phase and amplitude and was edited accordingly .",
    "phase self - calibration was performed for all the calibration sources and 3c84 was used to derive the instrumental phase offset between the continuum and spectral configurations .",
    "amplitude self - calibration was performed on 3c84 and this source was used to derive bandpass correction tables and also to measure the polarization leakage .",
    "systematic leakage was calibrated and there was found to be a residual leakage of @xmath20 0.5 per cent stokes i in stokes q and u and @xmath20 0.25 per cent in stokes v. 3c286 was used to derive the polarization angle correction .",
    "the various corrections appropriate for each frequency were then applied to on1 , including phase and amplitude solutions derived from 2013 + 340 .",
    "inspection of the spectra of each of the on1 lines in lhc and rhc enabled the selection of the brightest channel in a single hand of circular polarization , this was imaged to obtain an accurate reference position .",
    "the systematic position errors are @xmath012 mas at 6@xmath57 ghz due to uncertainty in the phase calibration , telescope positions and atmospheric variation ( etoka , cohen & gray 2005 ) .",
    "the clean components of each reference image were then used as a model for phase and amplitude self - calibration and the solutions applied to all channels and both polarizations of that line .",
    "finally , the brightest channel in the weaker hand of polarization for each line was selected and self - calibrated , applying the solutions to that hand of polarization only . in this way ,",
    "good calibration was achieved without compromising the absolute position accuracy or the polarized phases and amplitudes .    when all calibration was complete , the contributions of the antennas were re - weighted according to their sensitivity , their individual efficiency and to avoid baselines to a single antenna completely dominating the array ( http://www.merlin.ac.uk/user_guide/ ) .",
    "this allowed preparation of clean image datacubes for each line in all 4 stokes parameters ( i , q , u and v ) and in rhc and lhc .",
    "a circular restoring beam of 50 mas fwhm was used with a pixel size of 12 mas , giving in total an image field of view of 12 arcsec .",
    "i images had a 1@xmath21 noise level of 25 mjy beam@xmath9 and 15 mjy beam@xmath9 for methanol and oh respectively , except in the brightest total intensity channels , which were dynamic range limited with a noise level of up to 0.5 per cent of the peak .",
    "the lhc and rhc images had noise levels of 35 , 20 and 25 mjy beam@xmath9 for the methanol , 6.031- and 6.035-ghz oh lines , respectively .",
    "elliptical gaussian components were fitted to each patch of emission above 5@xmath21 in each stokes i , lhc and rhc channel and the position , deconvolved size , peak and total intensities , and the uncertainties were all measured .",
    "any components not found at similar positions in a series of 5 or more consecutive channels were discarded .",
    "the relative positional errors for all components , determined from the errors in the peak position of the gaussian fits , were 2 mas or better ( for the accuracy of gaussian component fitting see condon 1997 ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ; richards , yates & cohen 1999 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in component size is the square root of 2 multiplied by the position uncertainty , which enables brighter component sizes to be determined with meaningful accuracy .",
    "the position and intensity of emission in the q , u , and v channel maps were measured at the position of each stokes i component for that line and channel .",
    "51 individual channel stokes i components were detected in the 6.667-ghz methanol transition .",
    "these individual channel components were grouped into features as described in section 2 and the flux density weighted mean properties for each feature are given in tables [ table1 ] and [ table1.5 ] .",

    "peak flux densities of the individual features varied between 0.48 jy beam@xmath9 and 73.62 jy beam@xmath9 .",
    "estimates of the deconvolved component sizes from the gaussian fitting ranged from 16 to 52 mas ( equivalent to 29 to 94 au at the assumed distance of 1.8 kpc ) . combined with the peak flux densities these allowed lower limits to the peak brightness temperatures to be determined ( ranging between 1.99 @xmath10 10@xmath22 k and 8.97 @xmath10 10@xmath23 k ) .",
    "no previous high resolution observations of 6.7-ghz methanol are available in the literature for comparison .",
    "a larger restoring beam of 100 mas was used to search for extended emission , similar to that seen in w3(oh ) by harvey - smith & cohen ( 2005 ) , but none was found .",
    "it is difficult to speculate how much of the single dish flux density is recovered by the current observations as the previous single - dish observations were taken in 1999 ( szymczak et al .",
    "2000 ) and showed possible variability in comparison to the previous observations in 1991 ( menten 1991 ) .",
    "the two flux densities recorded were , as noted in section 1 , 109 jy and 91 jy respectively , taken with the 32-m torun and the 43-m greenbank telescope .",
    "the errors in the absolute flux density calibrations for the two observations were @xmath415 per cent and @xmath410 per cent respectively , so the two measurements could be consistent to within the errors .",
    "however , there have been a number of studies into the variability of 6.7-ghz methanol masers , most recently by goedhart , gaylard & van der walt ( 2005 ) , and these have served to show that 6.7-ghz methanol masers are generally variable on timescales of years , but the nature of their variability is wide ranging from periodic / quasi - periodic through monotonic increases / decreases to sporadic behaviour , and so with just two previous epochs it is impossible to judge the nature of the possible increased flux density in 1999 .",
    "given there is a lack of extended emission from the 100 mas restoring beam and if minimal variability is assumed , then comparison with the spectrum of szymczak et al .",
    "( 2000 ) implies the flux density recovered is likely to be over 80 per cent .",

    "this would result in a separation of @xmath0 10 mas between the overall line of ground - state and excited - state oh masers and @xmath0 25 mas between the ground - state oh and the methanol .",
    "coupled with the uncertainties in these calculations , possible peculiar motion , and the absolute positional errors of the two sets of data ( 20 mas and 15 mas respectively ) , it is possible that proper motion may account for the spatial separation seen .",
    "an accurate determination of these offsets requires near simultaneous observations of both frequency regimes , but this is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "however , if this apparent lack of spatial coincidence is demonstrated it could be the result of differences in the specific column densities of the two species , as modeling of oh and methanol masers by cragg , sobolev & godfrey ( 2002 ) showed that both oh and methanol require very similar high density , low temperature regimes ( dust temperatures exceeding 100 k , gas temperatures @xmath36100 k , and densities in the range 10@xmath11 @xmath36 n@xmath37 @xmath36 10@xmath38 @xmath39 ) . on the other hand , subtle variations in the above parameters could pick out the exact conditions required for each species of maser . a plot of the approximate regions for maser emission for a dust temperature of 175 k is given in fig .",
    "[ figurepp ] .        for the excited - state oh and methanol frequencies of the current observations , based on a combination of the absolute and relative positional errors as per etoka et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , 15 mas can be taken as the distance for association , within which it is not possible to determine if individual methanol and excited - state oh features are spatially separate and hence may indicate coincidence and/or co - propagation . in the current study , there is no association between the 6.7-ghz methanol and the 6-ghz excited - state oh ( the closest emission peaks are separated by @xmath023 mas , even taking into account the deconvolved component sizes there is still distinct separation ) .",
    "the two transitions also display significantly different magnetic field strengths as described in section 4.3 .",
    "the rhc and lhc zeeman pair at 6.031 ghz coincides with a 6.035-ghz oh zeeman pair to @xmath365.5 mas spatially and @xmath360.049 km s@xmath9 in velocity , implying co - propagation .",
    "this is a confirmation of the suspected coincidence which was identified in desmurs & baudry ( 1998 ) to within their accuracy of @xmath0200 mas .",
    "gray , field & doel ( 1992 ) show that for the two transitions to be coincident , if the dust temperature is @xmath050 k and assuming a hydrogen number density of 2.5 @xmath10 10@xmath22 @xmath39 , then the kinetic temperature must be @xmath075 k. however the results of cragg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , using a more extensive model and a dust temperature of 175 k , allow for a range of kinetic temperatures ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ figurepp ] ) .",
    "the 100 per cent association of 6.031-ghz emission with 6.035-ghz is consistent with previous results , such as by etoka et al .",
    "the fact that there is only one case of coincidence of all the features shows the physical conditions of the main group of maser spots must vary from the offset coincident pair .    at face value",
    "the data sets we have show that the individual 6-ghz excited - state oh features do not appear to show any spatial coincidence with ground - state oh to within 20 mas ( the closest separation of peak emission is @xmath028 mas ) .",
    "there is one exception , a satellite line feature at 1612-mhz .",
    "there are only two 1612-mhz oh features in the region , one is separated by 34 mas from 6.035-ghz emission , the other has just a 7 mas separation . as mentioned earlier this may be accounted for by proper motion of the region , but if not then it may imply , contrary to previous models , that there might be an overlap in the conditions for maser emission between the 1612-mhz transition and the 6.035-ghz transition , which is not present for the other ground - state oh transitions . on the other hand the two transitions could be tracing higher density gas , but not be spatially coincident , and so exist in different temperature regions .",
    "gray et al . ( 1992 ) suggest the 1612-mhz transition requires kinetic gas temperatures of @xmath40150 k and hydrogen number densities around 6 @xmath10 10@xmath41 @xmath39",
    "[ figurepp ] also implies a higher density is required for both to be present , but if the dust temperature is consistent , the kinetic temperature regimes vary ( but as noted in the caption to the figure other factors may allow for the two to be coincident ) .",
    "it is also possible to conclude that the possible spatial separation between the ground - state and excited - state oh ( with the exception of the one 1612-mhz feature ) , could mean we see the very highest density of oh in the excited - state regions , as the conditions for excited - state oh maser emission extend to higher densities than the ground - state ( fig .",
    "[ figurepp ] ) . as",
    "the methanol lies in the same , slightly offset , region of 6.035-ghz emission it too perhaps is in a similarly high density regime . however of course if both the gas density and temperature are high , then the collision rate will be increased and both species of maser are likely to be quenched .",
    "combined with the 1612-mhz distribution , this would lead to the assumption the excited - state oh traces the slightly cooler , dense gas , the 6.668-ghz methanol the hotter dense gas and the 1612-mhz tracing possibly the hottest dense gas ( although the abundances of the molecular species and the dust temperature may also vary ) .",
    "the higher density region could be indicative of a shock front , propagating away from the uchii .",
    "velocities of the maser features suggest a positional gradient , with 3 of the 4 methanol features showing a north - west to south - east gradient , which is also seen in the excited - state oh at 6.035 ghz in 3 of the 5 features . if a gradient does exist this would concur with the ground - state oh picture and the possibility that the masers are tracing an outflow or disk .",
    "interestingly two of the methanol features and one of the 6.035-ghz",
    "oh features also demonstrate tentative velocity gradients within their individual channel components .",
    "the two methanol features internal gradients lie on a north - east to south - west direction , i.e. perpendicular to the overall velocity gradient across the features , and may suggest the masers are tracing a planar shock ( elitzur , hollenbach & mckee 1992 ; dodson , ojha & ellingsen 2004 ) .",
    "the 6.035-ghz oh feature s internal gradient meanwhile , lies parallel to the main distribution .    for comparison w3(oh ) represents a star - formation region at a similar distance to on1 , which has been studied at high resolution for multiple transitions of masers ( menten et el .",
    "1992 ; sutton et al . 2004 ; wright et al .",
    "2004 ; harvey - smith & cohen 2005 ; etoka et al . 2005 ; harvey - smith & cohen 2006 ) .",
    "the region has far more maser features across the transitions and there is far more `` intermingling '' between the species and transitions , without the possible separation that is seen in on1 . within 15 mas in w3(oh ) there is a high percentage of associations between the excited - state oh and the mainline ground - state oh ( etoka et al .",
    "2005 ) , which may not be the case for on1 .",
    "both regions show a lack of association on the smallest scales between 6-ghz oh and 1720-mhz",
    "oh sources , but unlike w3(oh ) , on1 demonstrates possible association of 6-ghz oh with 1612-mhz oh .",
    "w3(oh ) shows 27 per cent of 6.7-ghz methanol masers had associated 6-ghz oh maser emission , whilst in on1 there is no association to 15 mas .",
    "some of these differences could be accounted for by a difference in the orientation of the regions and also the same caveat of internal and external proper motions may affect the w3(oh ) results ( in so far as the comparison of etoka et al .",
    "2005 compares data for mainline oh observed in 1996 , 4.7-ghz oh observed in 1993 and excited - state oh and 6.7-ghz methanol seen in 2001 ) .",
    "the current observations did not detect any extended emission above the 3@xmath25 limit of @xmath075 mjy beam@xmath9 at 100 mas resolution .",
    "this contrasts with the detection in the w3(oh ) star - formation region ( harvey - smith & cohen 2006 ) at a well established distance of 1.95 kpc ( xu et al .",
    "if on1 is at a similar distance , it lacks diffuse methanol emission ; however , if it is at the far - kinematic distance , it might just be undetectable at present .",
    "further study would be required , both to determine whether extended emission is prevalent in methanol maser sources , and thus expected to be seen , and better determination of the distance to on1 ( perhaps through maser astrometry as per xu et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the average polarization angle of @xmath560@xmath3@xmath428@xmath3 is consistent with the line of maser distribution , which is itself perpendicular to the known h@xmath1co@xmath2 outflow with a pa of 44@xmath3 ( kumar et al .",
    "this suggests the emission could be a propagating shock front , which agrees with the excited - state oh and methanol lying in a potentially higher density region , as identified in the previous section .",
    "faraday rotation is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency and as such will strongly affect the ground - state oh transitions .",
    "nammahachak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimate the external rotation measure for on1 to exceed @xmath5100 rad m@xmath42 , more than enough to disrupt any pattern present .",
    "for the excited - state oh at 6 ghz and methanol at 6.7 ghz internal faraday rotation is minimal .",
    "external faraday rotation , which is calculated from the standard faraday rotation equation using typical values for interstellar electron density and magnetic field as per vlemmings et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , but adjusted for the distance of 1.8 kpc , is of the order of 12@xmath3 and 11@xmath3 for the 6 ghz oh and 6.7 ghz methanol respectively .",
    "the coincident 6.031-ghz and 6.035-ghz zeeman pairs ( z@xmath15 and z@xmath43 ) show the same field strength to within the errors , which concurs with the possibility of co - propagation mentioned previously .",
    "however , as this is the only coincidence of the two transitions , and there is a similar sized field at 6.035-ghz for z@xmath6 , the magnetic field strength may not be intrinsically linked to the conditions necessary for maser co - propagation .",
    "the similarity of the 6.031-ghz and 6.035-ghz fields for z@xmath15 are in contrast to that found by desmurs et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where the 6031-ghz transition was seen to have stronger fields compared to the 6035 ghz transition .",
    "the tentative magnetic field strength of @xmath518@xmath46 mg derived from methanol for the current observations is larger than that of both the excited - state oh and the ground - state oh , although it is within the established upper limit for the field strength derived through methanol observations of w3(oh ) of @xmath522 mg ( vlemmings et al .",
    "the measured field strength implies the methanol may be tracing a localised increase in density compared to the oh . if the standard scaling law of b@xmath44 of crutcher ( 1991 ) is applied , which has been found to be valid up to the highest maser densities such as those probed by h@xmath6o masers ( vlemmings et al .",
    "2006b ) , then the implication is that the methanol masers occur in gas denser by a factor of 5@xmath510 compared to the oh masing gas at hydrogen densities of @xmath010@xmath45 .",
    "however , caution must still prevail as the magnetic field detection is only marginal .",
    "if further study demonstrated the presence of a stronger magnetic field in the regions of methanol maser emission , this could well lead to a better determination on the exact criteria for the 6.7 ghz emission or indeed the star - formation stage it traces .",
    "comparison with the ground - state oh magnetic field strengths measured by nammahachak et al .",
    "( 2006 ) highlight several similarities .",
    "the field strength of the 6.035-ghz oh seen towards the middle of the linear distribution , that of zeeman pair z@xmath6 , is comparable to the field strength of the nearby ( @xmath060 mas separation ) 1665-mhz oh , both giving 4.6 mg directed towards us .",
    "the the field detected at the south - east end of the distribution , for the 6.035-ghz oh zeeman pair z@xmath43 , is comparable to the 1720-mhz oh ( @xmath026 mas separation ) of 1.0 mg .",
    "however , located between these two sets of similar fields , the field strengths found for the methanol zeeman splitting and the 6.035-ghz oh zeeman pair z@xmath7 are both larger than the 1665-mhz oh field ( 1.5 mg ) , although in this case there is a larger separation of @xmath0190 mas .",
    "new high - resolution merlin data demonstrate for the first time the distribution and possible polarization properties of 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission in the on1 star - forming region .",
    "when combined with new excited - state oh observations and existing ground - state oh data , and correcting for the effects of galactic motion , we see all transitions lie in a similar region .",
    "we see the structure of on1 to be that of two parallel , possibly offset , elongated distributions , one in ground - state oh , one in interwoven excited - state oh and 6.7-ghz methanol .",
    "the 6.031-ghz transition of excited - state oh shows a linear polarization of 12 per cent , whilst the 6.035-ghz oh transition shows linear polarization varying between 10 per cent and 19 per cent . in comparison",
    "the methanol , as expected , demonstrates a lower value of @xmath01 per cent .",
    "consistent magnetic field strengths were observed across the region for the excited - state oh , with a slight tendency for smaller field strengths towards the south - east of the distribution , which is in agreement with the known ground - state oh magnetic field strengths .",
    "zeeman splitting was detected for the first time in the 6.7-ghz methanol maser emission , demonstrating a possible magnetic field strength of @xmath518@xmath46 mg .",
    "a zeeman pair at 6.031 ghz is seen in coincidence with a 6.035-ghz oh zeeman pair , with both having matching magnetic fields within the errors .",
    "this coincidence represented 100 per cent association to @xmath05 mas for the 6.031-ghz oh with the 6.035-ghz oh emission , but only a 20 per cent association of 6.035 ghz with 6.031-ghz oh . to the same level of spatial separation there is no coincidence between the methanol and excited - state oh transitions .",
    "the observed interweaving of excited - state oh and methanol maser features along the elongated distribution , together with the separation of these masers from the ground - state oh is in agreement with the postulation of caswell ( 1997 ) , that the two species delineate similar or complimentary regions .",
    "the separation of the individual methanol and excited - state oh features on the scales afforded by high resolution observations , could just be due to variations in the relative abundances of the species , or it could be that the methanol is tracing a slightly higher gas temperature or even denser regions and thus a different component of the region surrounding the evolving massive star .",
    "this is complimented by the significantly higher magnetic field strength suggested for the 6.7-ghz methanol maser .",
    "whether the maser features show a velocity gradient , and thus possibly trace a disk , is not possible to judge as the number of features are too few to draw statistically sound conclusions .",
    "however , the consistent polarization angles and offset nature of denser gas imply the masers trace a shock front , possibly in the form of a torus or ring around a young stellar object .",
    "this is also highlighted by possible orthogonal velocity gradients across the individual components of the methanol maser features .",
    "the shock front hypothesis concurs with the previous study of the ground - state transitions of oh of nammahachak et al .",
    "the potential shock front lies orthogonal to the known h@xmath1co@xmath2 outflow and future proper motion studies of the masers may be able to determine if they are moving in synchronization with the outflow .",
