    "alpha matter in its ground state may form a bcc lattice , which takes an advantage of closest possible packing of particles without destroying their identity @xcite . recent work focused on the possibility of the bose - einstein condensation of particles in nuclei @xcite and the competition between two- and four - body clustering in infinite matter  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is the study of uniform matter from the lattice field theory point of view .",

    "the matsubara green s function for our system can be written as ^m(_,x ) = [ i _ -(2m)^-1 ^ 2 + ] ^-1 , where the chemical potential includes contribution from the self - energy .",

    "this phenomenon is characterized by a pole in the distribution of bose particles , which then occupy the zero momentum ground state of the system - a state that is characterized by the condition @xmath40 at fixed temperature and density .",
    "the thermodynamic functions of the model are obtained from the partition function [ eq:5 ] z = .",
    "for example , the expectation value of the particle number density @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the volume .    the coupling constants of the continuum theory can be related to the values of the two - body scattering length @xmath59 ( derived from -potentials fitted to the scattering data ) only in the dilute limit .",
    "the details of short range physics become unimportant when the condition @xmath60 is fullfiled , where @xmath61 is the thermal wavelength of particles .",
    "however , the concept of scattering length can be used for dense systems if it is defined in terms of the full scattering @xmath15-matrix , instead of the born amplitude ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since the two - body -potentials are characterized by hard cores ( strong , short - distance repulsion ) we shall treat the scattering length as a parameter with the understanding that it can be derived from an appropriate @xmath15-matrix ( or phase - shifts ) , where the effects of the hard - core are removed by a full resummation of the ladder series .",
    "for the purpose of numerical simulations we discretize the continuum theory on a lattice by replacing the integrations over a summation over the lattice sites .",

    "the @xmath7 and @xmath1 theories are superrenormalizable .",
    "we leave the study of the renormalization group equations governing the present @xmath1 theory for the future . here",
    "we take the point of view of the effective field theory , which exploits the fact that the cut - off can be made so large ( spacing so small ) that the cut - off effect in the green s functions of the theory are completely negligible @xcite . in other words ,",

    "another limit that must be taken in the lattice monte - carlo simulations is the limit @xmath83 to minimize the finite lattice size effects ; in other words , the thermodynamic parameters of the system in a finite box must have a limit when the size of the box goes to infinity , and this limit should not depend on the periodic boundary conditions imposed . in practice",
    "we successively increase the size of the lattice and compare the observables ( e.g. the expectation values of the fields and the correlations functions ) until a convergence is reached .",

    "we note here that the parameters of the continuum action themselves are renormalized due to the higher order matsubara modes .",
    "these modifications , which are expected to be small in the vicinity of the critical temperature of phase transition , are neglected .",
    "a universal feature of the potential models of the nuclear -interaction is a repulsion for small separations , which is weakening as the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath86 increases from 0 to 4 , followed by an attractive tail that is largely independent of @xmath86 .",

    "the close agreement of our result for @xmath103  fm derived from the vp - potential with the results of johnson and clark obtained for the same interaction suggests that at low temperatures neither the temperature dependence of the thermodynamic potential @xmath104 , nor the contribution from @xmath105 partial wave are significant ( taking the limit @xmath106 in the present theory is complicated by the appearance of the bose - einstein condensate ) .",

    "the obtained equation of state is in a good agreement with the previous variational calculations of the binding energy of infinite matter at zero temperature @xcite in the intermediate density regime .",
    "the equation of state of low density alpha matter is presented here .",
    "the critical temperature of bose - einstein condensation of particles is found larger than the temperature for bcs condensation in the isoscalar @xmath112-@xmath113 ( quasi - deutron ) channel .",
    "the dominance of condensation is a low density phenomenon , since at densities above the so - called mott density particles are destroyed .",
    "the mechanism is the pauli principle acting among their constituent nucleons  @xcite .",
    "a treatment of the mott effect requires the knowledge of the internal structure of the alpha particles and is beyond the scope of present formalism .",
    "thus at asymptotically large densities ( of the order of nuclear saturation density ) one is left with a quasi - deutron bcs condensate @xcite .",
    "this work concentrated on a system consisting exclusively of @xmath120 particles .",
    "however , the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) , which contains two - body attractive interaction , may have a spectrum of bound states .",
    "it is known that @xmath121c ( the three alpha state ) is bound , therefore our system can evolve into a gas of @xmath121c particles , and even further to the point where the matter consists of @xmath122fe - the most stable nucleus . as pointed out in the introduction , calculations of the matter properties under supernova conditions show a substantial fraction of alphas present in the matter , which motivates the present study .",

    "<S> we obtain the equation of state of interacting alpha matter and the critical temperature of bose - einstein condensation of alpha particles within an effective scalar field theory . </S>",
    "<S> we start from a non - relativistic model of uniform alpha matter interacting with attractive two - body and repulsive three - body potentials and reformulate this model as a @xmath0 symmetric scalar @xmath1 field theory with negative quartic and positive sextic interactions . upon restricting the matsubara sums , near the temperature of bose - einstein condensation , to the zeroth order modes we further obtain an effective classical theory in three spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram of the alpha matter is obtained from simulations of this effective field theory on a lattice using local monte - carlo algorithms .    </S>",
