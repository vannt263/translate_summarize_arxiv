    "initially , used electron diffraction to study a gas phase sample .",
    "they assumed that the vapour of @xmath0-alanine was basically composed of a single conformer which had a high rotational barrier around the c2-c3 bonds ( following the carbon numbers in the figure  [ fig.alanine ] ) , which therefore hindered conversion to other conformers .",
    "in contrast , subsequently , many experimental and theoretical studies showed that in the gas phase , several neutral conformers of @xmath0-alanine can coexist at temperatures for which the experiments studies are performed , because their total energies only differ by around 0.1 ev .",

    "et al_. however , cao _ et al _ found that at the mp2 level conformer v was predicted to have the same set of experimental rotational constants and dipole moment of conformer i ; they therefore concluded that was not possible to unambiguously assign which conformer were being detected by microwave spectroscopy .",

    "as @xmath0-alanine is a very flexible molecule , intramolecular interactions , due to hydrogen bonding and steric effects , are important so the choice of appropriate diffuse and polarized basis functions are important for predictions of the correct geometries and relative energies . by analysis of minima on the potential energy surface for neutral @xmath0-alanine , csszr found 13 conformers and reported accurate geometries , various properties and spectroscopic constants of simulation of rotational and vibrational spectra .",
    "csszr s theoretical relative energy predictions include zero - point vibrational energy corrections , differ significantly from the experimental limits given by in their combined rotational study and structural study .",

    "kaschner and hohl s calculations confirmed that , in the gas phase , glycine and alanine prefer neutral than zwitterionic form . developed a method which combined laser ablation with rotational spectroscopy in a supersonic jet ; this allowed them to obtain structural information for each individual conformers present in the adiabatic expansion .",
    "this technique is most useful for low volatility organic compounds as it avoids using of thermal heating where the amino acid may decompose thermally before reaching their melting point .",

    "studied photoelectron spectra of gas - phase alanine using synchrotron radiation .",
    "they concluded that their results are consistent with the suggestion that conformer i is the predominant structure ; when they tried to include conformers ii and iii in any proportion in their analysis they did not improve agreement with their experimental results .",
    "although the i - iii structures that they optimized by dft b3lyp/6 - 31 g * * calculations had very close relative energies so that they would be expected in equal thermal population . in a combined theoretical and experimental study estimated the population ratio of the four lowest energy conformers of alanine from the experimental photoelectron spectrum supported by high level theoretical calculations .",

    "are consistent with an extremely low barrier to interconversion of iib @xmath7 iia and it was not expected that higher energy conformers could be isolated in a matrix at around 10 k. in contrast with glycine , they did not observed conformer iiib because of the very low iiib @xmath7 i barrier height in alanine . note that the nomenclature of conformers `` a '' and `` b '' used by differs from the `` a '' and `` b '' conformer designations of ) .",
    "the discovery that dna molecules could be severely damaged by secondary electrons with energies less than 20 ev , has led to increased research into electron scattering by biological molecules .",
    "the dna damage is caused when the low - energy electron is captured by an unoccupied orbital of a dna constituent molecule creating a transient anion or resonant state which can then decay into negative and neutral fragments .",
    "depending on what the type of dna constituent ( such as , amino acids , sugar , nucleobase , or phosphate moieties , etc ) absorbs the electron , this process can lead to single or double strand brakes in the dna molecule @xcite .",
    "conversely , there are relatively few works on electron collisions cross sections with alanine in the gas phase . , to our knowledge , were the first to measure elastic cross sections for alanine in the range from 40 ev to 80 ev . in a combined theoretical and experimental study , they compared their measured data with calculated results from a corrected form of the independent - atom method ( iam ) , known as the scar ( screen corrected additivity rule ) procedure and obtained good agreement between them .",

    "these resonances are important for the dissociative electron attachment ( dea ) process which is the main low - energy electron - collision destruction mechanism for neutral molecules @xcite . reported elastic differential cross sections ( dcs ) and ics for two conformers of alanine and observed differences in the resonance positions between them .    in this paper",
    ", we report a theoretical study comparing elastic cross sections for the 9 lowest - energy conformers of @xmath0-alanine in the gas phase for the energies ranging from 1 to 10 ev .",
    "we present averaged - cross sections which take into account relative populations of different conformers .",
    "we believe that these should be more reliable results for comparison with measured data at temperatures where the gas phase molecule is experimentally accessible .",
    "the organization of article is as follows : section 2 presents an outline of the theory and some details of the calculations are provided in section 3 .",
    "section 4 presents and discusses our calculated data ; this is followed by a summary of conclusions .",
    "in this work , we use the nomenclature and geometry of conformers given in table 2 of .",
    "csszr describes 13 geometrical structures of @xmath0-alanine corresponding to minima on the potential energy surface .",
    "we have used csszr s geometric parameters which were optimized at mp2/6 - 311++g * * level ; these parameters are given in the supplementary material .",
    "we aim to compute cross sections that can be compared with experimental data , so we need to consider that in crossed - beam experiments @xmath0-alanine is sublimed by heating to 400  500 k , as it is solid at room temperature .",
    "initially , we started to work with the 13 conformers of alanine given by csszr .",
    "however , below we limit our study to only the 9 lowest energy conformers , i to vb ( see table 1 of ) , because their boltzmann population ratios indicate that they dominate the population at temperatures at which the experiment are conducted .",

    "performed r - matrix calculations on two alanine conformers and present a detailed study of how this was done .",
    "here we use the same approach to calculate cross sections for 9 conformers ; the reader is referred to the previous calculation for further details .",
    "here we just present an brief summary of the r - matrix method and calculations . in this method ,",
    "space is split in two regions : the inner and outer region .",
    "the inner region is a sphere of radius @xmath8 around the target molecule centre - of - mass .",
    "the electronic density of the target molecule is considered , in practice , to be completely inside this region . here a radius of @xmath9 was used .",
    "the wave function of ( n+1)-electron system inside the sphere is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the wave functions of the target in the @xmath12 state and @xmath13 is the wave function of the continuum electron which is expanded in a partial wave expansion up to some maximum value of @xmath14 , @xmath15 ; @xmath16 is an antisymmetrization operator as the ( n+1)-electrons are indistinguishable in the inner - region electrons . the second summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) contains configurations @xmath17 which are included to relax the constraint of orthogonalization between scattering and target orbitals of the same symmetry , and to allow for target polarization effects . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the variationally - optimized coefficients of expansions .",
    "the polarization effects , which are related to the distortion of target electronic density , are calculated when @xmath17 configurations are included to allow the relaxation of target bonded orbitals .",
    "this level of calculation is called sep ( static - exchange - polarization ) .",
    "sep calculations are known to provide a good practical method of converging polarisation effects in low - energy electron molecule collisions and , in particular , of providing reliable predictions of resonance parameters in this region @xcite . following tests by , 30 virtual orbitals are used to generate @xmath17 configurations .    the outer region ,",
    "we solve a coupled second - order differential equation for the continuum electron , it is a one - particle problem .",
    "the r - matrix matches the inner and outer solutions , propagate to large @xmath20 and then uses the k - matrix to calculate scattering observables .",
    "the partial wave expansion includes partial waves explicitly up to @xmath15 ( @xmath15=4 ) and is then completed using a born closure procedure @xcite .",
    "this takes into account the long - range dipole interactions as all of alanine conformers have permanent dipole moment .",
    "the code polydcs @xcite is employed to calculate rotational transitions and the rotational constants used for each conformers are reported in supplementary material .",
    "the rotationally - unresolved elastic differential cross sections is obtained by the sum over rotational transitions until the convergence . here",
    "we limit our partial wave expansion to @xmath21 ; our previous study on alanine @xcite tested adding the @xmath15=4 partial wave .",
    "however , once the born closure ( which allows for the contribution of many partial waves particularly at low angles ) is performed , the results were essentially unchanged except that the @xmath21 calculations showed unphysical behaviour in the dcs for angles higher than 150@xmath4 when born closure procedure was used .",
    "in this section , we present our results including eigenphase sums , resonance positions , dcs and ics for elastic electron collisions with alanine molecules in the range of 1 to 10 ev .",
    "all the results were calculated in sep level with 30 virtual orbitals .",
    "all our target wavefunctions for the 9 conformers are described at the rhf/6 - 311+g * level and the relative energies compared with conformer i are around only 0.1 ev .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] reports key data on target conformers which are important for the calculations below .",
    "target wavefunctions and molecular properties were obtained using the molpro quantum chemistry package @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] gives our relative energy and dipole moment calculated at the rhf/6 - 311+g * level for all 9 conformers using geometries from optimized at mp2/6 - 311++g * * level .",
    "the boltzmann relative populations are presented for two levels of theory : rhf ( where our rhf relative energies are used ) , ccsd(t ) ( where relative energies calculated with ccsd(t ) method by are used ) and a set of experimental relative population deduced by .",
    "experimental studies of processes including dea , photoelectron spectra and elastic electron scattering require alanine to vaporized . in these gas phase",
    "studies the temperature , in general , ranges from about 400  k to 500  k. we observe that for a given level of theory , rhf or ccsd(t ) , the relative population is not significantly affected over this range of temperatures , however the ccsd(t ) population ratio is very different for conformers iia and iib , compared with that calculated at the rhf level . a detailed discussion of the difference in the total energies of @xmath0-alanine conformers at various levels of theory is given by , who commented that rhf calculations overestimate the relative energies compared to conformer i and fails to predict them reliably .",
    "according to csszr , when the electron correlation is included it stabilizes all conformers relative to conformer i , but not uniformly .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab:2 ] , the ccsd(t ) relative population for conformer iia , iib and iiib are very different compared to those predicted at the rhf level .",
    "the set of experimental relative population we considered were deduced by from the measured photoelectron spectra .",
    "their analysis found that it was only necessary to consider 4 conformers ( i , iia , iib and iiia ) in the molecular beam to fit their observations . comparing the ccsd(t ) population ratio with the experimental set , we find good agreement for iia , iib and iiia , but a larger discrepancy for conformer i.",
    "however we note that our analysis suggests that about 30  %  of the population should be in conformers not considered by farrokhpour _ et al _ and , given , that all populations are normalised , this leads to their population of conformer i being larger than our predicted one . the discrepancies and the absence of some conformers",
    "may well be related to the conversion from one conformer to another due to the very low barrier heights involved @xcite or decay by h - atom tunnelling  @xcite .",

    "however this in not true for the differential or integral cross sections where differences in dipole moments lead to large differences in the computed cross sections between conformers .",
    "this suggests that measured cross sections should depend on the relative population of the conformers and temperature .",
    "our results shows that for temperature ranging from 400  k to 500  k do not affect significantly the magnitude of cross sections .",
    "for this range of temperature , considering relative energies from the lowest - energy conformer i , the boltzmann statistics suggest that 9 conformers should be significantly populated in the gas phase . with flexible molecules , such as some amino acids ,",
    "computed cross sections should be averaged over all conformers weighted by the expected population ratio before comparing with the measured data .",
    "our results show that the averaged cross sections can be very different from those calculated for just the most stable conformer i. this means that averaged cross sections should give a more reliable to comparison with measurements .",
    "in particular , if some conformer has a particularly large cross section because , for example , it has a large dipole moment , its contribution to the total cross sections will be very dependent on its relative population , which will vary with temperature .",
    "furthermore , the population ratios calculated using two levels of theory , rhf and ccsd(t ) , to give the conformer energies are significantly different . the rhf calculations fail to predict the relative energies correctly , especially for those molecules which have intramolecular hydrogen bond , as is the case for amino acids .",
    "the population ratio calculated using higher levels of theory which include electron correlation , such as ccsd(t ) , give different population ratios and consequently a different averaged cross section . in this case",
    "the predicted population ratios for conformer iia , iib and iiia appear to be in good agreement with those deduced from experimental .    in conclusion ,",
    "as the cross sections depend on the geometry of the conformer or conformers considered , we recommend that for the authors who will publish theoretical cross sections for large and flexible molecules , such as amino acids , both specify which geometry was used for their calculation , otherwise their results will not be reproducible , and consider the effect of thermal averaging when comparing with experiment results .",
