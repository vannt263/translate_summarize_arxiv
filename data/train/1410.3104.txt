    "the last years have witnessed the development of heterogeneity in clusters and datacenters .",
    "two main reasons have led to this situation today .",
    "the first one is due to the maintenance and evolution of the components in the datacenters : different generations of computers are commonly seen in production datacenters since the owners are not changing everything at each update . the second reason is driven by the idea that heterogeneity might be the key to achieving energy - proportional computing @xcite , especially for high - performance computing applications .",
    "many recent studies alert dramatically on the energy consumption of the datacenters .",
    "for instance , koomey s report @xcite claims that today s datacenters are consuming nearly 2% of the global energy , and up to half of that is spent on cooling - related activities @xcite .",
    "this results generally in very poor power usage effectiveness ( pue ) .    in this paper , we study the multi - objective resource management problem for heterogeneous datacenters . besides the performance criterion",
    ", we also consider the energy consumption of the servers and their thermal impact on the datacenter cooling .",
    "the aim of our work is to optimize these objectives and to explore their tradeoffs . in particular",
    ", the energy consumption is partly due to the cooling efficiency in the datacenter @xcite , which is related to both the physical placement of the servers and the scheduling strategies when jobs dynamically enter and leave the system .",
    "the latter also affects the performance and the energy consumed by the servers .",
    "server placement in a computer room has been relatively less studied , especially its impact on the cooling efficiency .",
    "the reason for this lack of attention is mainly due to the fact that , when servers are homogeneous , their relative positions have no impact on the performance and computing energy .",
    "however , server placement can have an impact on the cooling infrastructure .",
    "the main observation is that one server might contribute to the temperature raise at the inlets of the other servers , due to the recirculation of heat in a datacenter .",
    "such mutual influence can be modeled by a heat distribution matrix among the servers . if one wants to keep the inlet temperature under a given threshold , the supplied air temperature has to be decreased accordingly by the cooling system , which in turn increases its energy consumption . in the presence of heterogeneous servers with different power consumptions and hence heat dissipation ,",
    "the problem of find the optimal placement becomes complicated and , to the best of our knowledge , has not been studied .",
    "since it is not feasible to change dynamically the positions of the servers in a datacenter , we focus on static placement to minimize the cooling cost induced by different configurations .    with a given server placement , the traditional problem of job scheduling in the heterogeneous environment remains .",
    "many previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) considered only the performance criterion and hence focused on the jobs execution times . in order to address the power consumption issue in datacenters , however",
    ", application scheduling must employ a multi - objective approach by considering performance , energy and cooling together . to account for the fact that a scheduler has no future knowledge ( jobs arrive over time ) , we need an online scheduling strategy . instead of designing different independent algorithms",
    ", we design a greedy online scheduling framework that can be adapted easily by redefining the cost function , from a single objective to two or more objectives . to tackle the energy - performance tradeoff ,",
    "we further introduce a fuzzy - based priority approach , which allows to explore the potential improvement in one objective while relaxing the other objective up to an acceptable range .",
    "this approach can be extended to incorporate more than two objectives in the framework .",
    "its principle is not limited to the case at hand and can potentially be applied to other multi - objective optimization problems .    the main contributions of this paper are the following :    * a static server placement heuristic to reduce the cooling cost for the servers in a datacenter .",
    "* a greedy scheduling framework and several cost functions to tackle single - objective scheduling ( for performance , energy , and cooling ) . * a fuzzy - based priority approach to handle the tradeoff between two conflicting objectives , and its extension to multi - objective optimization .",
    "these proposals are supported by extensive simulations conducted using real hardware specifications and software benchmarks , as well as experimentally verified cooling model and heat distribution matrix @xcite . specifically for the hardware ,",
    "a server system with high packing density and integrated cooling support is chosen for the experiments , which we believe represents well an emerging class of highly integrated energy - efficient servers .",
    "the results demonstrate the flexibility of our scheduling framework and confirm the effectiveness of the fuzzy - based approach for exploring the energy - performance tradeoff in heterogeneous datacenter environments .",
    "our static server placement heuristic is also shown to provide much improved thermal distribution leading to significant reduction in cooling cost .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : statement ] formally states the system model and the scheduling problem .",
    "section  [ sec : gmp ] describes our greedy server placement heuristic .",
    "section  [ sec : scheduling ] presents the job scheduling framework , various cost functions and the fuzzy - based priority approach .",
    "the simulation results are shown in section  [ sec : evaluation ] .",
    "section  [ sec : related ] reviews some related work , and section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the paper and addresses future directions .",
    "motivated by the placement of physical servers and the scheduling of high - performance computing ( hpc ) applications in heterogeneous datacenters , we consider the following system model : a set @xmath0 of @xmath1 servers ( or machines ) needs to be placed inside a computer room ( or datacenter ) with a set of @xmath1 rack slots , denoted by @xmath2 . each server @xmath3 consists of @xmath4 processors of the same type ( possibly on different boards ) , but the type and the number of processors may vary for different servers , rendering the system heterogeneous .",
    "each server consumes a _ base power _",
    "@xmath5 to support the basic operations of the infrastructure backbone , such as monitoring , networking and cooling ( for instance fans ) .",
    "a set @xmath6 of @xmath7 jobs arrive at the system over time , and they need to be assigned in an online manner to the servers .",
    "each job @xmath8 has a release time @xmath9 and a processor requirement @xmath10 that must be granted in order to run on any server . to execute job @xmath11 on server @xmath12 incurs a processing time @xmath13 and a power consumption @xmath14 , both of which are server - dependent and become known upon the job s arrival by prior profiling of the applications . in particular",
    ", the profiled application power consumption is assumed to include the leakage power .",
    "we study two orthogonal problems that deal with the placements of hardware and software , respectively .",
    "we call the two problems _ static server placement _ and _ online job scheduling_. the former concerns the positioning of physical servers in the datacenter , which as explained in section  [ sec : gmp ] will have an impact on the cooling energy in heterogeneous environment . the latter concerns the dynamic assignment of workloads to the servers , which will impact energy ( due to both computing and cooling ) as well as performance .    for the first problem of static server placement",
    ", each server needs to be physically and statically placed in advance to one of the available rack slots in the datacenter . in particular , we are looking for a mapping @xmath15 from rack slots to servers so that each slot @xmath16 is filled with a server @xmath17 .",
    "the objective is to minimize the cooling cost .",
    "more details about this problem will be described in section  [ sec : gmp ] .    given a particular server placement , an online scheduling strategy is then required to assign the jobs to the servers for execution .",
    "specifically , each arrived job @xmath18 must be assigned irrevocably to a server with at least @xmath10 idle processors , and without any knowledge of the future arriving jobs .",
    "once the job has been assigned , no preemption or migration is allowed , which is typically assumed for hpc applications since they tend to incur a significant cost in terms of data reallocation .    at any time @xmath19 ,",
    "the total computing power of server @xmath12 is the sum of its base power and the power consumed for executing all jobs assigned to it , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a binary variable that takes value @xmath22 if job @xmath11 is running on server @xmath12 at time @xmath19 and @xmath23 otherwise . in order to optimize performance ,",
    "we do not allow processor sharing among the jobs .",
    "thus , each server at any time can only host a subset of the jobs whose total processor requirements are no more than the server s total number of available processors , i.e. , @xmath24 for all @xmath25 at all time @xmath19 .      to characterize the cost of cooling , we consider a standard datacenter layout , where server racks are organized in rows with alternating cold and hot aisles .",
    "the computer room air conditioning ( crac ) unit supplies cool air to the cold aisles through raised floor vents .",
    "each server @xmath26 in the racks is oriented such that it draws cool air with temperature @xmath27 from the inlet and dissipates hot air with temperature @xmath28 to the outlet .",
    "assuming that the computing power consumed by a server is completely transformed into heat , the relationship between the power consumption and the inlet / outlet temperature of server @xmath12 at any time @xmath19 can be characterized by @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , with @xmath31 denoting the air density ( in @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 the airflow rate of server @xmath12 ( in @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 the air heat capacity ( in @xmath36 ) .",
    "due to complex airflow patterns , typical datacenters experience the so - called _ heat recirculation _ phenomenon , where the hot air from the server outlets recirculates in the room and is mixed with the supplied cool air from the crac , causing the temperature at the server inlets to be higher than that of the supplied air .",
    "prior studies @xcite have characterized this phenomenon with a _ heat distribution matrix _ @xmath37 by assuming a fixed airflow pattern in the room and conservation of energy as described by equation  ( [ eq : energyconserve ] ) .",
    "we adopt this approach here .",
    "let each element @xmath38 represent the temperature increase at the inlet of server @xmath12 per unit of power consumed by server @xmath39",
    ". represents the temperature increase for the server at slot @xmath40 due to the power consumption by the server at slot @xmath16 . for convenience",
    ", we simply assume that the servers are renamed such that server @xmath12 is placed in slot @xmath40 for all @xmath41 . ] combining the heat contributions from all servers , the inlet temperature of server @xmath12 at time @xmath19 is given by the following equation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the supplied air temperature at time @xmath19 , which should be adjusted to prevent the inlet temperature of any server from going beyond a _ redline temperature _ @xmath44 ; otherwise , the electronic components may not work reliably or are at risk of being damaged .",
    "hence , the supplied air temperature should be set at most to @xmath45 the cooling cost is specified as @xmath46 where cop is the _ coefficient of performance _ , defined as the ratio of the amount of heat to be removed to the energy that needs to be consumed in order to perform the cooling @xcite .",
    "this coefficient characterizes the efficiency of the crac unit , and is an increasing ( usually non - linear ) function of the supplied air temperature .",
    "intuitively , it means that the crac unit needs to work harder and thus consumes more energy in order to provide cooler air to the computer room .",
    "we consider the following _ bi - objective optimization problem _ : optimizing the performance of the jobs and minimizing the energy consumption of the datacenter , due to both computing and cooling .    for performance , we use the average response time of the jobs as the metric , and it is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath9 denote the completion time and release time of job @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the energy consumption comes from two sources : computing and cooling .",
    "the one due to computing is given by the total computing power of all servers integrated over time , i.e. , @xmath49 where @xmath50 $ ] denotes the interval of interest , during which all jobs arrive and complete their executions .",
    "this computing energy can be further divided into two parts , namely , the _ static _",
    "part due to the base power consumption , i.e. , @xmath51 and the _ dynamic _ part due to the power consumed for executing the jobs , i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 if job @xmath11 is assigned to server @xmath12 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the energy spent on cooling is the total cooling power integrated over time , i.e. , @xmath54 and as with computing energy , cooling energy can also be broken into a static part and a dynamic part .",
    "specifically , the static part is the cooling energy that will be spent during interval @xmath55 $ ] even if no job arrives , i.e. , @xmath56 and the dynamic part is the difference between the total cooling energy and the static one , i.e. , @xmath57    in this paper , we assume that all servers are turned on all the time to sustain the servers infrastructure backbone , so the static energy due to both computing and cooling is independent of the workload and the job scheduling strategy . on the other hand , the total dynamic energy given by @xmath58",
    "is closely related to job scheduling , and it will be the focus of this study .    due to the heterogeneity of the servers in the datacenter , different job scheduling strategies may result in very different job response time , computing energy and cooling cost .",
    "while a specific scheduling strategy may optimize one objective , these different objectives can be conflicting with each other , making the optimization difficult . in section  [ sec : scheduling ] , we will propose and evaluate online scheduling algorithms to address both performance and energy as well as to deal with their tradeoffs .",
    "in this section , we consider the problem of static server placement .",
    "we first motivate the study from the perspective of cooling in heterogeneous datacenters .",
    "we then formulate the problem and present a greedy heuristic .",
    "the literature contains extensive studies on virtual machine placement ( e.g. , @xcite ) for datacenters , but the placement of physical servers has received little attention .",
    "there are two main reasons .",
    "first , many traditional datacenters are homogeneous , so different placements of identical servers do not make a difference .",
    "second , traditional metrics such as job performance and energy consumption ( due to computing ) are independent of the servers relative positions , so they are unaffected by the different placement configurations .",
    "as far as the cooling cost is concerned for heterogeneous datacenters , however , the placement of the physical servers will have an impact .",
    "in particular , the studies in @xcite have shown that the heat recirculation phenomenon in typical datacenters exhibits the following properties :    ( 1 ) .",
    "different rack positions tend to behave differently in terms of heat recirculation .",
    "typically , servers located at the upper parts of the racks  inhale \" more recirculated hot air while servers located at the lower parts  contribute \" more hot air to recirculate in the room .",
    "( 2 ) . in a closed computer room with fixed locations of all major objects and without moving objects , the airflow pattern that characterizes the heat recirculation among different rack positions is relatively stable .",
    "while the first property suggests that the heat distribution matrix tends to be highly asymmetric , the second property assures that the matrix does not change significantly with different workloads in the servers or different positions of the servers . in the next section",
    ", we will rely on workload placement ( or job scheduling ) techniques to manage the cooling cost together with other objectives . here , we focus on arranging the positions of the servers with different power profiles .",
    "the goal is to reduce the maximum inlet temperature of the servers so as to minimize the cooling cost under a given load condition .    to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach ,",
    "consider a simple datacenter with two servers , two rack slots , and the following heat distribution matrix : @xmath59 suppose the two servers consume an average power of @xmath60w and @xmath61w , respectively . by placing the first server in slot 1 and the second server in slot 2 , their inlet temperatures increase by @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively according to equation  ( [ eq : tin ] ) . by simply swapping the positions of the two servers",
    ", their temperature increases will now become @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath66 difference in the maximum inlet temperature of these two configurations directly determines the temperature of the supplied air by equation  ( [ eq : supplytemp ] ) , and therefore impacts the cooling cost .",
    "for instance , consider a redline temperature of @xmath67 and the following cop model for a water - chilled crac unit in an hp datacenter @xcite : @xmath68 according to equations  ( [ eq : supplytemp ] ) and  ( [ eq : coolingcost ] ) , the cooling costs for the two placement configurations are @xmath69w and @xmath70w , respectively .",
    "the impact will be more significant with a lower redline temperature or a more skewed heat distribution matrix , or when the servers are consuming more power .",
    "the problem will also become more challenging when there is a large number of servers / positions , since exhaustive search will no longer be possible .",
    "the next subsection considers this general case and proposes a heuristic algorithm for the problem .      to reduce the cooling cost",
    ", we should minimize the maximum temperature increase at the inlet of any server in the datacenter .",
    "as we have seen previously , this is determined by both the heat - distribution matrix and the power consumption profile of all servers . while the former is relatively stable and",
    "can be measured using a sensor - based approach @xcite , the latter essentially depends on the servers workloads , which can vary with time . to cope with this uncertainty ,",
    "we characterize the power consumption of each server statically using the average power it consumes when executing historical workloads .",
    "this provides a reasonable estimation on the server s typical power consumption during runtime .",
    "we call this static value the _ reference power _ , and use it to determine the placement of the servers",
    ".    let @xmath71 denote the reference power of server @xmath3 .",
    "the _ static server placement _ problem can then be formulated as follows : find a mapping @xmath72 from rack slots to servers , so as to @xmath73 where @xmath74^t$ ] .",
    "finding the optimal placement turns out to be a np - hard problem for arbitrary heat - distribution matrix and reference power vector .",
    "appendix provides the np - hardness proof .",
    "given the hardness result , we design a heuristic algorithm for the static server placement problem based on a greedy allocation strategy .",
    "algorithm [ alg : gsp ] presents the pseudocode of our greedy server placement ( gsp ) heuristic .    first , gsp sorts the servers in descending order of reference powers ( line 1 ) . since the servers that consume more power on average will have larger contributions to the temperature increases at all inlets ,",
    "they are placed first to have more flexibility in the slot selection and so to avoid high peak temperature .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the existing temperature increase at the inlet of slot @xmath76 , and it is initially set to zero for all inlets ( line 2 ) .",
    "let @xmath77 denote the maximum temperature increase if the next server @xmath3 is placed in slot @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath78 server @xmath12 will be placed in one of the remaining slots @xmath79 that minimizes the maximum temperature increase , i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "the temperature increase at all inlets will then be updated and the filled slot @xmath81 will be removed from the available set @xmath82 ( lines 12 and 13 ) .",
    "the algorithm iterates over all servers and terminates after the last one is placed .",
    "for the complexity of the algorithm , sorting and initialization takes @xmath83 time . in the iteration",
    ", placing each server incurs @xmath84 time as all remaining slots are examined to determine the maximum temperature increase at all inlets .",
    "therefore , the overall complexity is @xmath85 .",
    "this is reasonable even for a large number of servers , since the process is performed relatively infrequently : new placement of the servers is only necessary if there are significant alteration to the datacenter layout or when some servers are removed and new ones are introduced .",
    "once the servers have been placed in a datacenter , they will start operation by executing the applications or jobs . in practice ,",
    "jobs are submitted by different users over time , so each job must be assigned to a server without knowing future job arrivals .",
    "this section considers online job scheduling under a given server placement to optimize performance and energy , and to deal with their tradeoffs .",
    "all online scheduling algorithms described in this section fall under a greedy scheduling framework ( gsf ) , which is evoked whenever a new job arrives or an existing job completes execution .",
    "algorithm [ alg : gsf ] presents the pseudocode of this framework .",
    "the variable @xmath86 shown in the pseudocode represents the cost of assigning job @xmath11 to server @xmath12 .",
    "specifically , @xmath86 can be a single - objective cost function of job response time , energy consumption , etc .",
    "( see section  [ sec : single ] ) , or it can be a composite cost function of two or more objectives ( see section  [ sec : multi ] ) .    for each newly arrived job @xmath11 , among the servers that have sufficiently available processors to host it , the server with the minimum cost in terms of @xmath86 will be chosen for assigning the job ( lines 2 - 9 ) .",
    "this makes the scheduling framework greedy .",
    "if no server has enough processors to host it , the job will be put in a waiting queue @xmath87 in shortest job first ( sjf ) order @xcite , which is known to optimize the average response time ( line 12 ) . note that",
    "although the processing times of the jobs are server - dependent , their relative sizes are assumed to be consistent on different servers , i.e. , a fast server is fast for all jobs .",
    "hence , sjf can be realized by using any server as the reference for comparing the jobs processing times .",
    "when a job completes execution on a server and therefore releases the occupied processors , the waiting jobs in the queue will be tested in sequence to see if they can be assigned to this server ( lines 16 - 18 ) . whenever a job is assigned or a running job completes execution , the number of available processors on the server will be updated ( lines 10 , 15 , 19 )",
    ". under this greedy scheduling framework ,",
    "the assignment of each job takes @xmath88 time , so the overall complexity is @xmath89 for assigning @xmath7 jobs .",
    "the next two subsections will describe heuristic algorithms that minimize different single- and multi - objective cost functions depending on the optimization criteria .",
    "single - objective scheduling considers one optimization criterion when deciding where to assign each job . in this subsection",
    ", we will present several single - objective scheduling heuristics .",
    "some of them will also be used as the base algorithms for designing the more complex multi - objective scheduling heuristics in the next subsection .",
    "first , the following describes some single - objective heuristics proposed in the literature @xcite .    * _ uniform _ : assign each job randomly to a server according to the uniform distribution . *",
    "_ minhr _ : assign each job to a server that contributes minimally to the heat recirculation in the room .",
    "the cost function is defined as @xmath90 * _ coolestinlet _ : assign each job to a server with the lowest temperature at its inlet .",
    "the cost function is defined as @xmath91 where @xmath27 denotes the current temperature at the inlet of server @xmath12 .",
    "note that , in @xcite , these heuristics were applied in the offline setting , where the information of all jobs is available to the scheduler . here",
    ", they are cast as online heuristics . while the aim of _ uniform _ is to balance the workload on all servers , _",
    "minhr _ and _ coolestinlet _ attempt to minimize the overall heat recirculation and to achieve a uniform temperature distribution , respectively . however , these heuristics were proposed for the homogeneous datacenter environments , and therefore do not consider job - specific characteristics .",
    "the following heuristics take job - dependent information into account by minimizing the performance , energy consumption , and temperature , respectively .    *",
    "_ perf - aware _ : assign job @xmath11 to a server that renders the minimum response time .",
    "the cost function is defined as @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the execution time of job @xmath11 on server @xmath94 . * _ energy - aware _ : assign job @xmath11 to a server that incurs the minimum dynamic energy consumption due to both computing and cooling .",
    "the cost function is defined as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the total dynamic energy defined in equation  ( [ eq : totaldynamic ] ) , and it is evaluated based on the currently running jobs and with job @xmath11 assigned to server @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath53 . *",
    "_ thermal - aware _ : assign job @xmath11 to a server that minimizes the maximum inlet temperature .",
    "the cost function is defined as @xmath97 where @xmath98 denotes the current temperature at the inlet of server @xmath39 , and @xmath14 denotes the power consumption of job @xmath11 on server @xmath12 .    except for _ uniform _",
    ", all heuristics above break the tie by randomly selecting a server with the best cost function .",
    "the difference between _ coolestinlet _ and _ thermal - aware _ is that the former considers the current inlet temperature before the job is assigned , whereas the latter considers the resulting temperature if the job is assigned to the server .",
    "note that all of these heuristics make greedy decisions locally for each arriving job , so they are not guaranteed to provide the optimal global cost .",
    "scheduling jobs to optimize two or more objectives usually require exploring the tradeoff between the conflicting goals . in this subsection , we propose a novel _ fuzzy - based priority _ approach to handle such a tradeoff .",

    "it is commonly applied in environments with strict or clearly - defined requirements , e.g. , job deadline or energy budget . instead of using an absolute value as the constraint ,",

    "compared to simple priority and constraint optimization , fuzzy - based priority is particularly suitable for scheduling hpc applications in datacenters , where no strict constraints or priority are normally imposed on job performance or energy consumption .",
    "compared to weighted sum , fuzzy - based priority provides an intuitive alternative to describing the tradeoffs while specifying soft preference of the user on the priority of the objectives . setting an appropriate fuzzy factor encodes such preference in an online manner .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : schema ] , the solution returned by fuzzy - based priority ( and other approaches ) when scheduling an individual job actually lies on the pareto frontier .",
    "in this section , we will evaluate the proposed online scheduling heuristics with the fuzzy - based priority approach and the greedy heuristic for server placement .",
    "the evaluations are performed by simulation using the data center workload and resource management simulator ( dcworms ) @xcite .",
    "[ [ datacenter - configuration ] ] datacenter configuration + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we simulate a datacenter with 50 servers and the same configuration as the one considered in @xcite , which essentially determines the heat distribution matrix . specifically , the datacenter consists of two rows of racks in a typical cold aisle and hot aisle layout .",
    "the cool air is supplied by the crac unit from the cold aisle between the two rows .",
    "each row has five racks and each rack contains five servers .",
    "the server platform used in the simulation is based on christmann s _ resource efficient cluster server ( recs ) _",
    "unit @xcite , which is a multi - node computer system consisting of 18 processors .",
    "the datacenter consists of 900 processors in total .",
    "the recs platform is chosen because it represents an emerging class of high - density and energy - efficient servers with built - in power and temperature sensors and integrated cooling support .",
    "table [ tab : parameters ] shows the parameters used in the simulation , whose values are based on real measurements in a recs unit . from the first three parameters , the heat distribution matrix @xmath37 used in this paper is derived by adopting the same airflow pattern as the one measured in @xcite .",

    "jobs arrive according to the poisson process , and the arrival rate @xmath132 is increased from 20 to 200 with a fixed arrival duration of 8 hours .",
    "the total number of jobs ranges from 160 to 1600 , and the system load is between 0.1 and 1 .",
    "this section presents the simulation results .",
    "first , we evaluate the performance of various online scheduling heuristics with a fixed placement for the servers .",
    "we then study the impact of different placement configurations on the performance of the scheduling heuristics .",
    "all results are obtained by carrying out the experiments 10 times and taking the average .",
    "we first evaluate the online scheduling heuristics for a single objective .",
    "the results are used as references for exploring the energy - performance tradeoff in the next subsection . in both cases ,",
    "the server placement is fixed with each type of processor occupying 10 contiguous server slots over two racks , according to the order specified in table [ tab : processors ] .",
    "six heuristics presented in section  [ sec : single ] are evaluated , namely , _ uniform _ , _ minhr _ , _ coolestinlet _ , _ perf - aware _ , _ energy - aware _ and _",
    "thermal - aware_. figure  [ fig : single ] presents the results of these heuristics .",
    "as we can see in figure  [ fig : single : meanrt ] , _ perf - aware _ has significantly better average job response time compared to the other heuristics , especially under light system loads .",
    "this is because all jobs in _ perf - aware _ are assigned to high - performance ( faster ) processors before slower ones whenever possible .",
    "for the same reason , _ perf - aware _ also has better makespan ( completion time of the last finished job ) and processor utilization ( ratio between the utilized processor cycles and all processor cycles during the simulation period ) , as shown in figures  [ fig : single : makespan ] and  [ fig : single : utilization ] .",
    "note that the processor utilizations remain under 70% even when the system load reaches 1 .",
    "this is partly due to the fragmented processors in some servers that can not be utilized because a ready job simply has higher processor requirement .",
    "figure  [ fig : single : totalenergy ] compares the total ( dynamic ) energy consumption of the scheduling heuristics , and figures  [ fig : single : computingenergy ] and  [ fig : single : coolingenergy ] show the energy consumed for computing and cooling , separately . for all heuristics , the energy consumption increases with the system load or the total number of jobs in the arrival interval . _ energy - aware",
    "_ consumes less total energy compared to the other heuristics , since jobs are assigned to processors with better energy efficiency .",
    "the improvement is more significant in terms of computing energy . for the cooling part , _ minhr _ and",
    "_ thermal - aware _ consumes roughly the same energy as _ energy - aware _ , since they are designed to minimize the heat recirculation and the maximum inlet temperature , which in turn increases the supplied temperature in the room and hence directly impacts the cooling cost .",
    "figure  [ fig : supply_temp ] shows the average supply temperature of the different scheduling heuristics in the simulation period .",
    "indeed , _ thermal - aware _ and",
    "_ minhr _ are better than _ energy - aware _ in terms of the average supply temperature by up to 1.3@xmath135 and 1.6@xmath135 , respectively .",
    "as the system load increases further and hence the processor utilization becomes higher , the performance of all heuristics tend to converge , since all servers are roughly equally loaded under all heuristics .",
    "in particular for _ energy - aware _ , some jobs are forced to be assigned to the high - performance servers since the energy - efficient ones are all occupied , resulting in improved average job response time .",
    "we now evaluate the effectiveness of the fuzzy - based priority approach for exploring the energy - performance tradeoff in online scheduling . to this end , we consider the composite cost function @xmath136 that optimizes the energy consumption followed by the job response time .",
    "figure  [ fig : two1 ] shows the results of minimizing @xmath137 when the fuzzy factor @xmath102 is increased from @xmath23 to @xmath22 at three different system loads ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) .",
    "the values of both objectives are plotted as a function of @xmath102 , with energy consumption shown on the left @xmath101 axis and average response time on the right .",
    "in addition , the figure also shows the results when @xmath141 and @xmath142 , denoting the cases where the scheduling decision is based solely on the first objective ( energy ) and the second objective ( response time ) .",
    "the two cases are equivalent to the single - objective heuristics _ energy - aware _ and _ perf - aware _ , respectively .",
    "as we can see , the average response time improves with increased fuzzy factor at the expense of the energy consumption under all system loads .",
    "however , the improvement can be significant even before major compromise in energy consumption is observed .",
    "for instance , at medium load ( @xmath143 ) , the response time is reduced by about 1000 when @xmath102 reaches 0.6 without much increase in the energy consumption .",
    "similar results can also be observed at light load and heavy load .",
    "the fuzzy - based priority approach can take advantage of such characteristics by setting suitable fuzzy factors in order to achieve desirable energy - performance tradeoff in the online setting .    figure  [ fig : two2 ] shows the energy - performance tradeoff curve for @xmath144 obtained by varying the fuzzy factor from 0 to 1 .",
    "the results of the six single - objective heuristics are also shown in the figure under the respective load .",
    "we can see that _ minhr _ and _ thermal - aware _ lie around the curve ( or even slightly to the left of the curve in the case of _ minhr _ ) , indicating that they achieve fairly efficient tradeoffs between job response time and energy consumption . on the other hand , _ uniform _ and _ coolestinlet _ are completely dominated by the curve , which suggests that they provide less attractive tradeoff results .",
    "figure  [ fig : two3 ] plots the tradeoff curves achieved by optimizing the heat recirculation and the maximum inlet temperature followed by the job response time , i.e. , with cost functions @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the results under three different system loads are shown alongside the ones for @xmath137 .",
    "the curves indicate that the two heuristics are able to provide better tradeoffs in the medium to high energy range ( e.g. , between 150 and 220 for _ minhr _ at @xmath143 ) while the tradeoff remains efficient for the cost function @xmath137 when the energy consumption is close to the minimum .",
    "the results demonstrate the flexibility of the fuzzy - based priority approach in exploring the energy - performance tradeoff in online scheduling . the approach can be potentially applied to other multi - objective optimization problems .",
    "we now study the impact of server placement on the performance of the online scheduling heuristics .",
    "besides the simple location - based placement used in the previous evaluations , which we call loc , we generate three additional placements for the servers .",
    "one is based on our gsp heuristic and the other two are based on its variations .",
    "we call the three placement configurations gsp1 , gsp2 and gsp3 , respectively . the two variants ( gsp2 and gsp3 ) are obtained in a similar fashion as gsp1 . in particular , in gsp2 the servers are sorted in ascending order of reference power instead of descending order , and in gsp3 each server is assigned to a remaining rack slot that maximizes the maximum inlet temperature instead of minimizing it .",
    "apparently , these two heuristics are counter - intuitive and are expected to provide undesirable configurations .",
    "the purpose of including them is to demonstrate the impact of different server placements on a scheduling algorithm s performance , especially on the cooling cost .",
    "figure  [ fig : serverplacement_example ] shows the inlet temperature distribution of the 50 servers under the four placement configurations . in all cases , each processor is loaded with the average power consumption of the benchmarks shown in table  [ tab : benchmarks ] .",
    "as we can see , gsp1 has better thermal balance than the other configurations .",
    "specifically , it improves loc by about @xmath147 in terms of the maximum inlet temperature and improves gsp2 and gsp3 by over @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively .",
    "figures  [ fig : sp_perf ] and  [ fig : sp_energy ] show the performance of _ perf - aware _ and _ energy - aware _ under the four server placements at different system loads . in both heuristics , job response time and computing energy",
    "are not affected by different configurations .",
    "however , gsp1 has reduced cooling energy compared to the other configurations .",
    "this is particularly evident under heavy system load , where all servers are almost fully and equally loaded , thus their power consumption ratios match closely those of the average values used in the server placement heuristic . under light system load , however , the servers could experience unbalanced loads , which causes their power consumption ratios to deviate from those of the average values . as a result ,",
    "the advantage of gsp1 becomes smaller or even diminishes , but since the overall energy consumption is small in this case , the impact of server placement is not significant .    quite similar effect on the cooling energy can be observed for _ thermal - aware _ and _ minhr _ as shown in figures  [ fig : sp_thermal ] and  [ fig : sp_minhr ] .",
    "notice that , for these two heuristics , different server placements also lead to a tradeoff between job response time and computing energy . to further investigate the tradeoff efficiency , figure  [ fig : tradeoff_mix ] shows the energy - performance tradeoff curves for three heuristics with cost functions @xmath137 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 at load @xmath152 under different server placements .",
    "we can see that , although the tradeoff remains , in all cases gsp1 provides the best cooling energy and hence improves the overall tradeoff efficiency .",
    "note that _ minhr _ and _ perf - aware _ behave exactly the same under gsp1 , since servers with faster processors and hence more power consumptions are placed in the slots with less heat recirculation . therefore , the same performance and energy are observed for @xmath150 regardless of the fuzzy factor , as shown in figure  [ fig : tradeoff_mix : minhr ] .",
    "the results confirm that strategic server placement indeed improves the thermal balance in a heterogeneous datacenter , which helps reduce the cooling cost .",
    "this is achieved with little impact on the job response time and computing energy , or the tradeoff between them .",

    "<S> , we are confronted with their different behaviors in terms of performance , power consumption and thermal dissipation : indeed , heterogeneity at server level lies both in the computing infrastructure ( computing power , electrical power consumption ) and in the heat removal systems ( different enclosure , fans , thermal sinks ) . </S>",
    "<S> also the physical locations of the servers become important with heterogeneity since some servers can ( over)heat others . </S>",
    "<S> while many studies address independently these parameters ( most of the time performance and power or energy ) , we show in this paper the necessity to tackle all these aspects for an optimal resource management of the computing resources . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to improved energy usage in a heterogeneous datacenter including the cooling of the computer rooms . </S>",
    "<S> we build our approach on the concept of heat distribution matrix to handle the mutual influence of the servers , in heterogeneous environments , which is novel in this context . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a heuristic to solve the server placement problem and we design a generic greedy framework for the online scheduling problem . we derive several single - objective heuristics ( for performance , energy , cooling ) and a novel fuzzy - based priority mechanism to handle their tradeoffs . finally , we show results using extensive simulations fed with actual measurements on heterogeneous servers .    </S>",
