    "since the discovery of multiferroic properties in tbmno@xmath0,@xcite the field of multiferroic materials have attracted a lot of interest.@xcite this interest arises from the emergence of new fundamental physics@xcite and potential technological applications.@xcite this field also gave rise to the reinvestigation of a large number of `` old '' materials such as , for instance , the manganites rmno@xmath0 @xcite or the pyroxene family.@xcite historically , the first family of multiferroic materials to be investigated was the boracite family .",
    "boracites are materials exhibiting the general formula m@xmath0b@xmath6o@xmath2x where m is a transition metal ion or alternatively mg , cd .",
    "the vast majority of the boracites are halogen boracites with compositions x = cl , br or i.@xcite occasionally x can be oh , f or no@xmath0 and these associated phases have been much less investigated.@xcite the boracites have been widely investigated due to their ferroelectric , ferroelastic and magnetic properties.@xcite several compositions within the boracites with x = cl are natural minerals .",
    "they are of interest for mineralogists due their complex twinning and anomalous optical properties.@xcite despite the large number of studies dedicated to this family and its wide chemistry , few studies have been dedicated to the determination of their magnetic ground states using neutron diffraction.@xcite    recently , a new composition with m = fe and x = oh has been reported.@xcite it has been shown that this boracite crystallizes in the space group _ r3c _ ( no . 161 ) .",
    "this system orders antiferromagnetically below t@xmath3 @xmath7 4.8 k and potentially exhibits magnetic frustration .",
    "magnetic frustration could arise due to the arrangement of magnetic fe@xmath8 ions which is based on a triangular framework .",
    "a magnetic system is considered to be spin frustrated when the ratio f = @xmath5 is equal to or greater than 6.@xcite for fe@xmath0b@xmath6o@xmath2oh , f is about 5.6,@xcite and thus it may exhibit some magnetic frustration .",
    "however in the absence of neutron diffraction , this study could not further probe the exact nature of the ground state of this material .",
    "we aim here to investigate the magnetic ground state using powder and single crystal neutron diffraction .",
    "additionally , we have used neutron diffraction in order to better characterize the crystal structure and in particular the hydrogen position which could not be located from x - ray single crystal work .",
    "small single crystals of fe@xmath9b@xmath1o@xmath2(oh ) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method .",
    "a mixture of feo , @xmath10b@xmath11o@xmath0 , and naoh solution ( 4 mol / l ) was sealed in a silver capsule .",
    "then it was heated up to 600 @xmath12c in a test - tube - type autoclave under 150 mpa of hydrostatic pressure . after the reaction for 3 days",
    ", the product was washed with hot water in order to remove the excess of @xmath10b@xmath11o@xmath0 .",
    "@xmath10b@xmath13o@xmath0 was used in order to reduce the absorption of natural boron by neutrons .",
    "most of the neutron diffraction measurements were carried out on powder samples .",
    "the precise crystal and magnetic structures were investigated using high resolution powder data at various temperatures using the d2b diffractometer at the institut laue langevin ( ill ) .",
    "the measurements were carried out at a wavelength of 1.594 corresponding to the ( 335 ) bragg reflexion of a germanium monochromator .",
    "the neutron detection is performed with @xmath14he counting tubes spaced at 1.25@xmath12 intervals for d2b . a complete diffraction pattern is obtained after about 25 steps of 0.05@xmath12 in 2@xmath15 .    powder neutron diffraction was carried out by crushing small single crystals resulting in a fine light brown powder .",
    "measurement was carried out above the nel temperature ( t @xmath16 9 k ) and below ( t = 1.8 k ) .",
    "diffraction data analysis was done using the fullprof refinement package .",
    "@xcite    additional data were collected on the high resolution four - circle single crystal diffractometer d9 at the ill .",
    "few reflections were followed as function of temperature to determine the critical temperature behavior of the magnetic order .",
    "data collection was done using a wavelength of 0.706 obtained by reflection from a cu(220 ) monochromator .",
    "the wavelength was calibrated using a germanium single crystal .",
    "d9 is equipped with a small two- dimensional area detector@xcite , which for this measurement allowed optimal delineation of the peak from the background .",
    "for all data , background corrections@xcite and lorentz corrections were applied .",
    "attempts to solve the crystal structure using single crystal neutron diffraction data were unsuccessful due to large twinning of the crystals .",
    "consequently only few reflections measured on the single crystal diffractometer could be used .",
    "powder diffraction data were used to solve the crystal and magnetic structures .",
    "attempts to refine the crystal structure at 9 k using the x - ray single crystal model were unsuccessful .",
    "the best refinement which could be obtained is shown in figure [ cell9k_no - h ] .",
    "these data show clearly that some intensity is lacking over the whole pattern .",
    "this discrepancy results from the impossibility from the x - ray single crystal data to locate the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group . prior to investigate the magnetic properties of this polar iron boracite , we have been using the neutron diffraction data in order to locate the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group .",
    "localization of the missing hydrogen atom participating to the hydroxyl group was done by calculating the difference fourier map of the refined pattern shown in figure [ cell9k_no - h ] .",
    "the difference fourier map obtained at 9 k is illustrated in figure [ fouriermap ] .",

    "while all the investigated compositions by neutron diffraction exhibit the same magnetic symmetry pc@xmath25a2@xmath26 and a lower symmetry than fe@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2(oh ) , their resulting magnetic moments are lower than the spin only values . in the paramagnetic space group pca2@xmath171@xmath25 , there are 3 different crystallographic site for m. function of the metal m , the neutron experiments show that there is one or two crystallographic sites exhibiting magnetic frustration giving rise to a reduced magnetic moment . for m = co and x = br , despite the presence of the expected large orbital momentum contribution , the third site exhibits a magnetic moment of 1.7(1 ) @xmath23 while the other 2 show respectively a magnetic moment of 4.7(2 ) and 4.0(2 ) @xmath23.@xcite for mn@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2i , only one site shows a saturated magnetic moment with 5.4(2 ) @xmath23 while the other two sites are reported with a magnetic moment of 3.8(2 ) @xmath23.@xcite similar results are reported for the other compositions investigated by neutron diffraction.@xcite in boracites , the frustration parameter f increases going from x = i @xmath4 br @xmath4 cl.@xcite using the results from literature for m = fe , we can further extend the rule to x = oh and we notice that the frustration parameter f increases from x = oh @xmath4 i @xmath4 br @xmath4 cl going from 1.4 ( x = cl ) to 5.6 ( x = oh ) .",
    "the f parameter for the halogen boracites remains small irrespective of the chemical composition and much below 6 ( at most f @xmath16 3 for x = i ) .",
    "consequently the lowering of symmetry from _ r3c _ to _ pca2@xmath17 _ gives rise surprisingly to an increase of the reduction of the magnetic moment while the frustration parameter f decreases .",
    "dft calculations would be necessary in order to investigate in more detail the magnetic frustration in the boracites .",
    "we have investigated by neutron diffraction the crystal and magnetic structures of the newly reported trigonal iron boracite fe@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2(oh ) .",
    "we were able to locate the hydrogen atom within the structure by fourier map difference .",
    "the hydroxyl group is characterized by a hydrogen oxygen bond distance in excellent agreement with other hydroxyl groups reported in other minerals . in agreement with previous report",
    ", we find that below t@xmath3 = 4.86(4 ) k an antiferromagnetic state takes place characterized by @xmath27 = @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting magnetic moment is 4.5(2 ) @xmath23 is larger than the spin only value of 4 @xmath23 .",
    "this difference is probably related to the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment .",
    "we show that the magnetic frustration in boracites increases along x = oh @xmath4 i @xmath4 br @xmath4 cl although without giving rise to a reduced magnetic moment for x = oh as expected for a magnetically frustrated system . we demonstrate that fe@xmath0b@xmath1o@xmath2(oh ) is a very unusual system within the boracite family .",
    "we expect that this work will stimulate experimental investigations of the other compositions with the boracite family with x = oh and no@xmath0 .",
