    "optical fibre transmission systems carrying the overwhelming bulk of the world s telecommunication traffic have undergone a long process of increasing engineering complexity and sophistication @xcite .",
    "however , the key _ physical effects _ affecting the performance of these systems remain largely the same .",
    "these are : chromatic dispersion , fibre nonlinearity due to the optical kerr effect , and optical noise .",
    "although the bandwidth of optical fibre transmission systems is large , these systems are ultimately band - limited . this bandwidth limitation combined with the ever - growing demand for data rates",
    "is expected to result in a so - called `` capacity crunch '' @xcite , which caps the rate increase of error - free data transmission @xcite .",
    "designing spectrally - efficient transmission systems is therefore a key challenge for future optical fibre transmission systems .",

    "the evolution of the optical field along the fibre is represented by a nonlinear partial differential equation with complex additive gaussian noise .. ] the accumulated nonlinear interaction between the signal and the noise makes the analysis of the resulting channel model a nontrivial problem .",

    "* sec .  1 ) , @xcite , exact channel capacity results for fibre optical systems are scarce , and many aspects related to this problem remain open . until recently , the common belief among some researchers in the field of optical communication was that nonlinearity was always a nuisance that necessarily degrades the system performance .",
    "this led to believe that the capacity of the optical channel had a peaky behavior when plotted as a function of the transmit power .",
    "partially motivated by this , a multitude of nonlinearity compensation methods have been proposed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , each resulting in different discrete - time channel models .",
    "recently , a paradigm - shifting approach for overcoming the effects of nonlinearity has been receiving a lot of attention .",
    "this method relies on the fact that both the me and nse in the absence of losses and noise are _ exactly integrable _ @xcite .",
    "this gave rise to the concept of the nonlinear fourier transform ( nft ) which can deal with the channel s nonlinear cross - talk @xcite .",
    "variants of this method are known as _ eigenvalue communications _",
    "@xcite , _ nonlinear frequency division multiplexing _",
    "@xcite , and digital back - propagation in the nonlinear fourier domain @xcite .",
    "the nft can be understood as the generalisation of linear fourier transform ( ft ) onto nonlinear integrable systems .",
    "similarly to the ft , the nft decomposes a space - time domain waveform into the superposition of nonlinear normal modes in the nonlinear spectral domain @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * ch .",
    "the key underlying feature of an nft - based transmission system is that , for an integrable system , these nonlinear spectral modes propagate without nonlinear cross - talk in the nft domain .",
    "thus , the parameters of these modes can be used for data transmission over a nonlinear fibre .",
    "such a transmission method can in principle be inherently free from cross - talk , and thus , the development of efficient and numerically stable algorithms has also attracted a lot of attention @xcite . furthermore , there have also been a number of experimental demonstrations and assessments for different nft - based systems @xcite .",
    "however , for systems governed by the me , the only results available come from the recent theoretical work of maruta and matsuda @xcite .",
    "two nonlinear spectra ( types of nonlinear modes ) exist in the nse and the me .",
    "the first one is the so - called continuous spectrum , which is the exact nonlinear analogue of the familiar linear ft @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "18 ) , corresponding to the dispersive nonlinear modes . the unique feature of the nft is , however , that apart from the continuous spectrum , it can support a set of _ discrete _ eigenvalues ( the nondispersive part of the solution ) . in the time domain",

    "the spectral efficiency of the multiple - eigenvalue encoding schemes is an area actively explored at the moment @xcite . finding the capacity of the multi - eigenvalue - based systems in the presence of in - line noise that breaks",
    "integrability still remains an open research problem .",
    "if only a single eigenvalue per slot is used , the problem is equivalent to a well - known time - domain amplitude - modulated soliton transmission system . in this paper",
    ", we consider this simple set - up , where a single eigenvalue is transmitted in every time slot .",
    "the obtained results are applicable not only to classical soliton communication systems , but also to the novel area of the eigenvalue communications .",
    "although the set - up we consider in this paper is one of the simplest ones , its channel capacity is still unknown .",
    "furthermore , the only results available in the literature @xcite are exclusively for the nse , leaving the me completely unexplored .",
    "in particular , previous results include those by meron et al .",

    "the mi and capacity of a single - soliton transmission system was presented .",

    "for all the continuous inputs , the lower bounds are shown to be nondecreasing functions of the snr .",
    "the second contribution of this paper is to provide an asymptotic closed - form expression for the mi of the noncentral @xmath5 channel with an arbitrary ( even ) number of degrees of freedom .",
