    "most models of gamma ray emission from blazar jets consider inverse compton scattering of energetic electrons off low energy photons as the main gamma ray production mechanism . in the synchrotron - proton blazar ( spb ) model , recently proposed by ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite accelerated protons interact with the synchrotron radiation field produced by the co - accelerated electrons via meson photoproduction and bethe - heitler pair production , and more importantly , with the strong ambient magnetic field , emitting synchrotron radiation ( pions and muons also emit synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "since this model neglects external photon field components , it is most applicable to bl  lac objects which have weak accretion disks .",
    "@xcite have shown that this model can reproduce the commonly observed double - humped blazar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "gamma ray loud bl  lac objects are commonly classified as hbls or lbls on the basis of their ratio of radio to x - ray flux i.e. hbls have a broad - band spectral index @xmath3 and lbls have @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "consequently , for lbls , the synchrotron peak is generally observed at optical / ir - frequencies while the x - ray band covers the local minimum of @xmath5 between the two spectral humps .",
    "lbls are thought to represent an intermediate object class between quasars , which have generally a much higher bolometric luminosity than bl  lac objects , such that @xmath5 peaks in the ir and at mev - gev - energies , and hbls , which are the least luminous blazars , and have @xmath5 spectral peaks at soft to medium - energy x - rays and gev - tev gamma rays .    in this paper",
    "we present for the first time the predicted neutrino emission from a typical hbl and lbl in the spb model , assuming that mkn  421 and pks  0716 + 714 are typical for each source population , respectively .",
    "we inject an spectrum of @xmath6 protons into the jet ( primed quantities are in the jet frame ) , and they are assumed to remain quasi - isotropic in the jet frame due to pitch - angle scattering .",
    "the co - accelerated relativistic electrons radiate synchrotron photons which serve as the target radiation field for proton - photon interactions , and for the subsequent pair - synchrotron cascade which develops as a result of photon - photon pair production in the highly magnetized environment . in the spb model ,",
    "the target photon density @xmath7 is much smaller than the magnetic field energy density , and thus inverse compton losses can be neglected .",
    "the pair - synchrotron cascade redistributes the photon power to lower energies where the photons escape from the emission region , or `` blob '' , of size @xmath8 which moves relativistically in a direction closely aligned with our line - of - sight .",
    "the proton energy loss processes considered in the model are photomeson production , bethe heitler pair production , proton synchrotron radiation and adiabatic losses due to jet expansion .",
    "synchrotron radiation from @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( from photomeson production ) prior to their decay becomes important in highly magnetized environments with @xmath11 several tens of gauss @xcite , and is taken into account in our calculations .",
    "the acceleration rate for any acceleration mechanism is @xmath12 where @xmath13 describes the efficiency , and @xmath14 is the magnetic field in the blob .",
    "the maximum proton energy is limited by the balance between energy gain and loss rates .",
    "direct proton and muon synchrotron radiation seems to be mainly responsible for the high energy hump whereas the low energy hump is dominanted by synchrotron radiation from the directly accelerated @xmath15 , with a contribution of synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons produced by the proton- and @xmath9-synchrotron initiated cascade .",
    "the contribution from bethe - heitler pair production turned out to be negligible . for our calculations we use a monte - carlo method and utilize the recently developed sophia code for the photohadronic event generation @xcite .",
    "mkn  421 is a well - known tev - blazar , and is classified as an hbl .",
    "we have used the average sed published by @xcite to derive its model parameters in the framework of our model .",
    "the _ observed _ low energy hump , identified as synchrotron radiation , serves as the target photon field in our model for pion photoproduction and cascading .",
    "we have parametrized the observations by a broken power law with photon spectral index 1.5 below the lab frame break energy @xmath16 ev , and index 2.25 up to the cutoff energy of @xmath17 kev .",
    "our model represents the data well @xcite for doppler factor @xmath18 , @xmath19 ev , and @xmath20 kev , u@xmath21 ev/@xmath22 , an emitting volume of @xmath23au@xmath24 , @xmath25 g , ambient proton energy density @xmath26 erg @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "1 shows the relevant time scales .",
    "the clear dominance of the proton synchrotron radiation at high energies is apparent , while pion production is rather of minor importance .",
    "the proton spectrum is cut off at @xmath29 due to proton synchrotron radiation .",
    "significant @xmath10 synchrotron losses do not occur below the proton cutoff , while @xmath9 synchrotron radiation can not be neglected .",

    "is indicated as a thick straight line .",

    "losses due to photo - meson production limit the injection proton spectrum to about @xmath48 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "with proton synchrotron radiation being rather unimportant here , photo - pion production dominates the electromagnetic energy output , and is responsible for a stronger neutrino flux than in the hbl case ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "due to the low cutoff of the proton spectrum , pion synchrotron radiation can again be neglected .",
    "g , @xmath43 , @xmath49 cm , @xmath50 ev/@xmath22 , @xmath51 erg/@xmath27 , @xmath52 , @xmath53.,width=313 ]    our modeling seems to favour the hypothesis that the low luminosities observed from hbls might be due to an _ intrinsically _ low jet - frame target photon density while the more luminous lbls may possess rather _ intrinsically _ high jet - frame target photon fields .",
    "the consequences of this hypothesis for the synchrotron - proton blazar model will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "hadronic blazar models produce neutrino emission mainly through the production and decay of charged mesons , e.g. @xmath54 followed by @xmath55 . the neutrinos escape without further interaction .",
    "3 shows the predicted neutrino output from mkn  421 , which is considered as a typical hbl , and the typical lbl pks  0716 + 714 .",
    "we give the predicted neutrino emission from the objects themselves , and do not consider here any additional contribution from escaping cosmic rays interacting while propagating through the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "the clear dominance of neutrino emission from lbls in comparison to hbls is obvious .",
    "the reason for this is the higher meson production rate in the lbl source population ( see also fig .  1 and 2 ) due to their higher target photon fields in comparison to the hbl population .",
    "the proton injection spectrum is modified by photohadronic losses . for mkn  421",
    "the photopion production rate approximately follows a broken power law , @xmath56 for proton energies below @xmath57  gev , and @xmath58 above @xmath59  gev ( see fig .  1 ) due to the break in the target photon spectrum .",
    "this leads to a break in the neutrino spectrum at @xmath57  gev ( observer frame ) , from power spectral index @xmath60 to @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the cutoff at @xmath63 gev in the observer s frame is caused by @xmath9-synchrotron losses , whereas @xmath10-synchrotron emission turns out to be unimportant .",
    "another important source of high energy neutrinos is the production and decay of charged kaons if the proton - photon interaction takes place predominantly in the secondary resonance region of the cross section @xcite",
    ". this might be the case for hbls because their target photon field can extend up to x - ray energies . the positively charged kaons decay in @xmath64 of all cases into muons and direct high energy muon - neutrinos .",
    "in contrast to the neutrinos originating from @xmath10 and @xmath9-decay , these muon - neutrinos will not have suffered energy losses through @xmath10- and @xmath9-synchrotron radiation , and therefore appear as an excess in comparison to the remaining neutrino flavors at the high energy end ( @xmath65@xmath66  gev ) of the emerging neutrino spectrum , and in addition cause the total neutrino spectrum to extend to @xmath67  gev .",
    "in contrast , the neutrino emission from pks  0716 + 714 is cutoff at @xmath63 gev ( observer frame ) for all neutrino flavors ( see fig .",
    "3 ) due to a roughly one order of magnitude lower proton cutoff . also @xmath9 synchrotron losses may play a role here .",
    "the neutrino spectrum follows a power law with index @xmath60 below the cutoff , and is caused by photohadronic interactions with the target photon field above @xmath68 . because of the @xmath30-production threshold and the relatively low proton cutoff in lbls , meson production in the photon field below @xmath68 can not occur , leading to a simple power law for the neutrino spectrum .    the photon - hadron interactions for both , lbls and hbls , take place predominantly in the resonance region . here ,",
    "@xmath69 , and thus @xmath70 production is suppressed ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "previous hadronic jet models expected equal photon and neutrino energy fluxes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our model predicts for hbls a peak neutrino energy flux approximately two to three orders of magnitude lower than high energy gamma rays ( @xmath71 ) , while for lbls the neutrino and gamma ray output is approximately comparable ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "from inspecting fig .  3 it is immediately clear that lbls would dominate the bl lac contribution to the diffuse neutrino background unless hbls turn out to be significantly more numerous than lbls .    a commonly used method to estimate the diffuse neutrino background due to unresolved blazars is to determine the ratio gamma ray to neutrino emission , @xmath73 , in the objects in question , and then normalize to the observed extragalactic gamma ray background ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "the different photon to neutrino ratio we found in hbls and lbls leads to various implications for the diffuse neutrino emission .",
    "the extragalactic diffuse gamma ray background ( egrb ) as detected by egret is @xmath74 photons @xmath75 s@xmath76 sr@xmath76 above 100 mev @xcite .",
    "thus , the extragalactic neutrino background ( enb ) due to unresolved egret blazars can be estimated by : @xmath77 gev @xmath75 s@xmath76 sr@xmath76 where @xmath78 is the fraction of photon power lost in the cosmic background matter and radiation field , and @xmath79 is the presumed blazar contribution to the egret egrb @xcite .",
    "propagation of gamma rays at @xmath80 gev is relatively unattenuated , and is therefore comparable to neutrino propagation , so we set @xmath81 .",
    "since lbls are egret - sources , and with @xmath82 , a diffuse neutrino flux of @xmath83 gev @xmath75 s@xmath76 sr@xmath76 follows _ if lbls dominate the blazar contribution to the egret diffuse gamma ray background_. this is slightly above the neutrino upper bound derived using cosmic ray constraints by @xcite and @xcite for optically thin sources , but well below the upper bound for optically thick sources .",
    "thus , we conclude that either lbls do not dominate the blazar contribution to the egret egrb , or lbls are rather thick sources ( like quasars ) .    our estimate of the enb due to hbls follows a similar procedure . since hbls emit , however , most of their photon power at tev - energies , we extrapolate the @xmath84 egrb spectrum as observed by egret up to 25 tev , the highest energy observed from any hbl , to estimate the unattenuated egrb flux in the @xmath85 gev energy range .",
    "the resulting enb from hbls is then @xmath86 gev @xmath75 s@xmath76 sr@xmath76 , where @xmath87 is here the hbl contribution to our estimated diffuse tev - background . even for @xmath88",
    "the predicted enb intensity lies several orders of magnitude below the neutrino upper bounds ( waxman & bahcall 1999 ; mannheim et al .",
    "2001 , mpr ) , and is also lower than the estimate from mpr of the bl lac contribution to the enb using the observed xbl luminosity function .",
    "note , however , that mpr assumed pion photoproduction was the main proton loss process , whereas in the spb model for hbls proton synchrotron losses dominate at the expense of pion ( and neutrino ) production .",
    "the same is true for @xcite , where one to two order of magnitude higher contribution from tev - blazars to the diffuse neutrino background was estimated in comparison to this work .",
    "neutrino production spectra of bl lac objects are calculated in the framework of the synchrotron - proton blazar model @xcite using the sophia event generator for photomeson production @xcite .",
    "the @xmath89 spectra presented here for mkn  421 and pks  0716 + 714 , typical of hbls and lbls , respectively , are modeled using a parameter set which reproduces well the average sed of those blazars .",
    "we find higher pion production rates for lbls in comparison to the hbls , and this leads a higher neutrino output for a typical lbl by @xmath90 compared to hbls .",
    "muon synchrotron losses are responsible for a spectral cutoff in the neutrino sed at @xmath1 ev , with a possible extension of @xmath2s up to @xmath91 ev , due to kaon decay .",
    "the total power deposited in gamma rays and neutrinos is approximately equal for lbls , while a two to three order of magnitude smaller neutrino peak flux is predicted in hbls in comparison to their peak photon power .",
    "this leads to a significantly higher lbl contribution to the extragalactic diffuse neutrino background than from hbls , when the method of normalizing to the observed egrb is used for estimating the diffuse neutrino flux ."
