    ". they also assumed that the probability of observing @xmath65 glitches is given by poisson statistics .",
    "glitch size estimation from the core - quake model is far bigger than the glitch amplitudes of the vela pulsar and sample mean .",
    "thus , their work statistically excluded the core - quake model .",
    "they also compared the parameter estimates of the vortex unpinning model with those of glitches from vela and other pulsars , and concluded that the vortex unpinning model with a constant fractional vortex density ( @xmath66 ) is the most compatible model and can represent an invariant for glitches .    to test the glitch expectancy within the vortex unpinning model for glitches",
    ", we applied the same statistical glitch expectancy analysis ( see equation 11 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and estimated the expected number of glitches using @xmath014 yr of _ rxte _ observations .",
    "we calculated the critical fractional vortex density of the vortex unpinning model by using the time span between 1998 january and 2005 november , which contains three glitches and three glitch candidates @xcite .",
    "for a single pulsar , @xmath15/@xmath5 value is not expected to fluctuate between observations .",
    "however , this is not the case for as it changes between -1.87@xmath1610@xmath67 s@xmath20 and -1.31@xmath1610@xmath67 s@xmath20 with an average value of -1.66@xmath1610@xmath67 s@xmath20 , which further implies the noisy timing characteristics of the source .",
    "therefore , we performed our calculations for all these three values .",
    "first we included the observational gaps into the total time span which , by the chosen noise criterion , restricts our analysis to large glitches with @xmath4/@xmath5 on the order of @xmath3 . using @xmath15/@xmath5 values and observed number of glitches with @xmath4/@xmath5@xmath010@xmath7 ( i.e. , n = 2 )",
    ", we obtain the upper , lower and average values for critical parameter value of the vortex unpinning model .",
    "we note an important fact here that a glitch candidate ( i.e. , near candidate glitch 2 in @xcite ) was reported by @xcite with a fractional amplitude of 1.2@xmath1610@xmath7",
    ". if the latter report is correct , the number of large glitches in the 1998@xmath12005 interval would be 3 ( i.e ,",
    "n = 3 ) which changes the critical parameter . finally",
    ", we excluded all data gaps except the ones with glitches reported in them , and the ones that satisfied the noise criterion in our analysis , and we considered all reported glitches with @xmath4/@xmath5 @xmath68 10@xmath69 ( i.e. , n = 6 ) and calculated the critical parameters for this case as well . in table  [ tab : gltexp ] we list the values of the critical parameter for each of the above - mentioned cases and their corresponding expected number of glitches in the time intervals between 1998@xmath12005 , 1998@xmath12011 , and 2006@xmath12011 . as expected , the average value of the critical parameter yields the observed number of glitches in the 1998@xmath12005 interval . we find that the total number of expected glitches with fractional amplitudes of @xmath68@xmath3 ( n = 2 in table  [ tab : gltexp ] ) varies between 3.2 and 4.6 if the time baseline spans untill the end of the _ rxte _ coverage of the source in 2011 november .",
    "the number of glitches in the 2006@xmath12011 time range , where we found a strong candidate , were expected to range from 1.4 to 2.0 .",
    "we then repeated the above procedure , this time excluding all data gaps except the ones with reported candidate glitches . in this case",
    ", the noise criterion allows consideration of all glitches with @xmath4/@xmath5 @xmath010@xmath69 ( i.e. , n = 6 ) , and we re - calculated the critical parameters ( see table  [ tab : gltexp ] ) .",
    "glitch expectancy analysis within the context of vortex unpinning model suggests that might have had , on average , two large glitches in 6 yr , corresponding to the interval of 2006@xmath12011 ( table  [ tab : gltexp ] ) .",
    "the two significant glitch candidates we identified in gap segments are , therefore , important , since they comprise the observed number to match with the expectancy of the vortex creep model .",
    "as far as only glitch statistics is concerned , this case implies that the mechanism leading to the observed glitches in is internal",
    ". however , where particular glitch characteristics were concerned ( e.g. , discrepancies in glitch recovery ) , the vortex unpinning model is argued to be not sufficient @xcite .",
    "is the only member of the magnetar family that has not exhibited energetic x - ray bursts .",
    "almost all other axps , that have experienced timing glitches , emitted energetic bursts either in conjunction with ( e.g. , 2259 , @xcite ) or contemporaneous to their glitches .",
    "it is , therefore , suggestive that a common mechanism might be responsible for both glitches and bursts .",
    "the dipole magnetic field strength of as inferred from its spin period and spin - down rate is about 4.6@xmath1610@xmath10 g , that is strong enough to produce significant deformation in the neutron star crust and eventually lead to the release of energy via bursts @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the condition on has not given rise to any observable bursts , even though it has experienced the largest number of glitches among all magnetars .",
    "while a common mechanism could reproduce coincident energetic bursts and glitches in general , it might be generating glitches but not detectable enhancements and bursts in , possibly due to this source having slightly lower crust shear modulus , so that the release of less energy can still produce breaks in the crust .",
    "the energetic bursts , however , are not accounted for within the context of the vortex unpinning model which appears to be favored for this source in our statistical investigations .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that vortices can be unpinned mechanically via oscillations rather than by a sudden heat release . according to their estimation",
    ", the relative velocity between the crust and superfluid , which is generated by the mechanical energy release at the depths below 100 m , can exceed the critical velocity lag and unpin the vortices . in order to explain the radiatively silent glitches",
    "seen in some axps ( as in the case of ) they proposed that mechanically triggered glitch event might not be accompanied by a long - term x - ray brightening since a glitch can be triggered by a less energy release . in this picture ,",
    "the origin of x - ray brightening is also through mechanical energy release and these flux enhancements are expected to be accompanied with glitch events .",
    "this scenario can be diagnosed through the exact timing of glitches with radiative enhancements @xcite .",
