    "the interaction of relativistic ejecta with the surrounding medium is an issue of considerable interest . during the early stages of the evolution a double shock structure forms , consisting of a forward shock that propagates in the ambient medium , a reverse shock crossing the ejecta and a contact interface separating the shocked ejecta and the shocked ambient medium . under certain conditions , an observable flash of electromagnetic radiation",
    "is expected to be emitted during the propagation of the reverse shock . in the fireball scenario",
    "commonly adopted , the naive expectation has been that optical flashes associated with reverse shock crossing should be quite common ( e.g. , kumar & panaitescu 2003 ; but c.f .",
    "nakar & piran 2004 ) , however , despite considerable observational efforts only a few have been detected , indicating that such flashes are rare .",
    "it has been proposed that the paucity of optical flashes may be attributed to an early onset of a r - t instability ( levinson , 2010a , b ) , or strong magnetization of the ejecta ( e.g. , zhang & kobayashi 2005 ; mimica et al .",
    "the latter is anticipated if the free energy is extracted magnetically in the form of a poynting - flux- dominated flow ( e.g. , levinson & eichler 1993 ; lyutikov & blandford 2003 ; giannios & spruit 2005 ) .",
    "stationary magnetic outflows allow , in general , only partial conversion of magnetic - to - kinetic energy , implying high magnetization at the onset of the afterglow phase . a better conversion can be achieved if the outflow is collimated into a small opening angle , @xmath5 ( komissarov et al .",
    "2009 ) , though corking from a star , as in the collapsor model for grbs , can alleviate the latter condition ( tchekhovskoy et al . , 2010 ; komissarov et al .",
    "however , even then @xmath6 is anticipated at best ( lyubarski 2009 ) .",
    "recently it has been shown ( granot et al . , 2010 ; hereafter gks10 ; lyutikov 2010a , b ) that time - dependent effects may play a crucial role in the acceleration of a magnetized flow .",
    "these authors considered the acceleration of a spherical , impulsive high sigma shell of initial width @xmath7 and magnetization @xmath0 , expelled by a central source .",
    "they have shown that , unlike a stationary flow for which acceleration ceases at @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the impulsive shell continues accelerating even after loosing causal contact with the central source until reaching nearly complete conversion of magnetic energy into bulk kinetic energy .",
    "the terminal lorentz factor of the shell is @xmath10 . during the acceleration phase , that they term `` magnetic rocket acceleration '' , the major fraction of the shell energy is contained in a layer of width @xmath11 , bounded between the front of a rarefaction wave reflected from the central source and the head of the shell .",
    "the average lorentz factor of the shell , roughly equals the lorentz factor of the fluid at the rarefaction front , evolves as @xmath12 .",
    "the structure of this layer is well described by a self - similar solution .",
    "once the shell enters the coasting phase its width starts growing and its magnetization continues to drop .    in this paper",
    "we consider the interaction of the shell with the external medium and show that in the high - sigma limit the evolution of the system is dramatically altered .",
    "a preliminary account of the effect of the ambient medium is given in gks10 , and a more detailed discussion in lyutikov ( 2010a , b ) .",
    "specifically , it is shown that for initial magnetization @xmath0 larger than some critical value , deceleration of the contact interface commences well before the shell has reached the coasting phase , when it is still highly magnetized . the lorentz factor of the contact discontinuity evolves as @xmath13 , while the rear boundary of the unshocked shell is still accelerating .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor of the compressed shell is then limited to @xmath14 .",
    "the reverse shock in this case is very weak or nonexistent , and within the framework of ideal mhd no internal dissipation is practically expected ( by either the reverse shock or any internal shocks that might form in a multi - shell scenario ) before the onset of the afterglow phase .",
    "lower sigma shells start decelerating after reaching the coasting phase .",
