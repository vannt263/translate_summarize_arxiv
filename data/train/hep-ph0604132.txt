    "it is quite plausible that the universe once experienced the epoch where its energy density is dominated by the coherent oscillation of a scalar field .",

    "another example is dilaton and moduli fields in superstring theories .",
    "the oscillating field eventually decays , followed by the reheating of the universe .",
    "then , the radiation dominated era ( the hot big - bang universe ) commences . at the same time , however , the decay of the oscillating field may produce unwanted particles .",
    "recently , it has been recognized that the gravitino production at the decay of a modulus field can cause cosmological disasters  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the decay width into the gravitino pair is non - suppressed and is comparable to that into other particles which couple to the moduli field with planck suppressed interaction .",
    "thus , the branching ratio of the moduli decay into the gravitino pair is sizable : in fact it is typically at a percentage level , or even higher .",
    "if the damped coherent oscillation of the modulus field once dominates the energy density of the universe , the overproduction of the gravitinos at its decay would cause serious problems to cosmology .",
    "the gravitino decay , if it is unstable , would spoil the success of the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "in addition , these unstable gravitinos decay into the lighter superparticles , resulting in the overabundance of the lightest superparticles ( lsps ) .",
    "these arguments push up the gravitino mass to a region disfavored from the naturalness problem associated with the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "one should be aware that the problem of the gravitino overproduction may apply to other heavy scalar fields .",
    "in particular , the case of inflaton is important .",
    "after the epoch of de sitter expansion driven by the vacuum energy , the inflaton field falls down to its true minimum and starts the damped coherent oscillation around the true minimum .",
    "eventually it decays to reheat the universe . in many inflation models , the mass of the inflaton , or more precisely the mass of the oscillating field after the slow - roll inflation , is much larger than the weak scale .",
    "thus , in the low energy supersymmetry , the decay into a gravitino pair is likely to be kinematically allowed .",
    "if the branching ratio is not negligible , then the gravitino production at the inflaton decay will cause serious cosmological problems .    in this paper",

    "note that the right - handed side of the above equation is the ( canonically normalized ) @xmath2-auxiliary component of the @xmath0 field .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 parameterizes the supersymmetry breaking felt by the @xmath0 field .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is expected to be order unity for a moduli field .",
    "if this is the case , the decay into the gravitino pair can be significant , in particular when the decays into other particles are also mediated by planck suppressed interactions .",

    "the first derivative of the potential is obtained as @xmath23 noticing that the @xmath2 auxiliary field is expressed , in terms of @xmath9 and its derivatives , as @xmath24 we find @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",

    "@xmath50 is the explicit susy breaking term which is of the form @xmath51 with some real function @xmath52 .",

    "let us discuss the cosmological implications of gravitinos which are produced by the heavy scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "we will consider the case in which @xmath0 dominates the energy of the universe when it decays .",
    "this situation can be achieved if @xmath0 obeys the coherent oscillation with a large initial amplitude and also it is long - lived . in this case , the decay of @xmath0 reheats the universe .",
    "we define here the reheating temperature @xmath76 by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the number of the effective degrees of freedom at @xmath79 , and the total decay rate of @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath80 .",

    "indeed , @xmath90 should be suppressed enough to avoid cosmological difficulties , as we will see below .",
    "now we are at the position to estimate the gravitino abundance . at the reheating epoch ,",

    "we should mention here that there are potential sources of gravitinos in addition to the above mentioned ones .",
    "first , gravitinos would be produced much before the decay of @xmath0 such that the abundance remains sizable even after the dilution by the reheating .",

    "the decay of the @xmath0 field produces the gravitinos as well .",
    "since its yield becomes larger when we lower the reheat temperature , the bbn bound gives the lower bound on @xmath76 .",
    "we have identified the allowed range of @xmath76 both in the case where the @xmath0 field is moduli - like and in the more general case .",
    "we have confirmed that if the gravitino mass lies in 100 gev10 tev range , no allowed region exists when @xmath288 is a moduli - like field , namely the field whose the decay into gravitinos is not suppressed ( @xmath289 ) and the decay into other particles is controlled by the planck suppressed interaction ( @xmath119 ) . on the other hand , for a more general case , we have found that the viable region of the parameter space does exist , but is severely constrained , as was shown in fig .",

    "the third constraint is also quite stringent , but rather involved . with the lack of the complete analysis all through the relevant parameter regions , we have argued to put the upper bound on the gravitino mass ( or the lifetime of the nlsp ) as roughly of order 1 gev when the nlsp is the stau weighing 100 gev .    in the rest of the paper",
    ", we would like to discuss the implications of our results to the inflationary scenarios .",
    "assuming that there is no entropy production at a later epoch , our consideration gives a stringent constraint on the reheating process right after the inflation .",

    "it is interesting to note that a new window of the gravitino warm dark matter opens up in which the gravitino with the mass around 100 mev , produced by the heavy moduli decay , constitutes the warm dark matter .",
    "furthermore the reheat temperature is of the order @xmath291 gev , which is a natural range we expect with the modular inflaton mass given above .",
    "the price we have to pay to realize this fascinating case is a slight suppression of the parameter @xmath7 by one order of magnitude , which , we suspect , should be possible within the framework of modular inflation .    as an important remark",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the above argument to the modular inflation can also apply to the cosmological moduli problem . in the unstable gravitino case ,",
    "the cosmological constraints are too strong to be escaped unless the gravitino mass is heavier than , say , @xmath269 tev as was discussed above . on the contrary",
    ", the cosmological moduli problem can be solved when the gravitino is light and stable , say @xmath213 gev .",
    "such light gravitinos can be realized in the models of the gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking .",
    "compared to the modular inflation where the @xmath0 mass is rather high , it is anticipated that the moduli mass is not very far from the electroweak scale .",
    "thus somewhat different region in the parameter space may be favored .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0 mass much below @xmath290 gev is also fine in this case .",
    "anyway , the solution requires the large hierarchy between masses @xmath69 and @xmath100 , which can be realized in a class of models of the moduli stabilization  @xcite .",
    "let us come back to the implications to the inflationary models .",
    "our results given in section 3 indicate that , to make the inflaton decay cosmologically viable in a wider range of the parameter space , a smaller branching ratio of the decay into the gravitino pair ( a smaller @xmath7 ) and a larger total decay rate ( a larger @xmath292 ) is favored . in a simple class of the chaotic inflation , the lagrangian is invariant under a @xmath293 discrete symmetry , a reflection of the field variable @xmath294 .",
    "thus at the minimum of the vacuum , @xmath295 will vanish and thus the decay of the inflaton into the gravitino pair does not take place and so the model does not suffer from the gravitino production problem .",
    "there are other inflationary models in which the parameter @xmath7 becomes much smaller than unity , by realizing the vev of @xmath0 in an intermediate scale lower than the planck scale .",

    "<S> cosmological issues of the gravitino production by the decay of a heavy scalar field @xmath0 are examined , assuming that the damped coherent oscillation of the scalar once dominates the energy of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of the scalar field to a gravitino pair is estimated both in spontaneous and explicit supersymmetry breaking scenarios , with the result that it is proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field in general . </S>",
    "<S> cosmological constraints depend on whether the gravitino is stable or not , and we study each case separately . for the unstable gravitino with @xmath1 100gev10tev , we obtain not only the upper bound , but also the lower bound on the reheating temperature after the @xmath0 decay , in order to retain the success of the big - bang nucleosynthesis . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that it severely constrains the decay rate into the gravitino pair . </S>",
    "<S> for the stable gravitino , similar but less stringent bounds are obtained to escape the overclosure by the gravitinos produced at the @xmath0 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement that the free - streaming effect of such gravitinos should not suppress the cosmic structures at small scales eliminates some regions in the parameter space , but still leaves a new window of the gravitino warm dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> implications of these results to inflation models are discussed . in particular , it is shown that modular inflation will face serious cosmological difficulty when the gravitino is unstable , whereas it can escape the constraints for the stable gravitino . </S>",
    "<S> a similar argument offers a solution to the cosmological moduli problem , in which the moduli is relatively heavy while the gravitino is light . </S>"
