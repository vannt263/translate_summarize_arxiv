    "scattering at center - of - mass ( cm ) energies exceeding the quantum gravity scale ( transplanckian scattering , or _",
    "t - scattering _ , for short ) is an exotic process of significant theoretical interest . in particular",

    "microscopic black hole formation and its subsequent evaporation is expected for impact parameters @xmath0 of the order of the schwarzschild radius @xmath1 of a black hole of mass @xmath2 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the detailed description of how this happens depends on the unknown underlying theory of quantum gravity and is at present out of reach . on the other hand",
    ", large impact parameters @xmath3 correspond to elastic small - angle scattering , whose amplitude can be predicted on the basis of general relativity alone .",

    "t - scattering is also interesting phenomenologically .",
    "if large extra dimension scenarios of tev - scale gravity @xcite are realized in nature , this process could be observed at the lhc and other future colliders @xcite,@xcite , as well as in collisions of high - energy cosmic neutrinos with atmospheric nucleons @xcite,@xcite . in these scenarios",
    "the total t - scattering cross section is finite , grows with energy , and is dominated by calculable small - angle scattering between partonic constituents @xcite,@xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : dispp ] . the subleading black hole production cross section at present can only be estimated from geometrical arguments .    in spite of the small scattering angle ,",
    "the typical momentum transfer in these scattering events is well above the qcd scale , and the typical impact parameter is much smaller than the proton size , which sets the typical distance between two uncorrelated partons inside the proton .",
    "it is unlikely that a multiple parton interaction , fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] , will occur in the same t - scattering .",
    "thus it is clear that the partonic picture should be applicable at leading order in the qcd coupling .",
    "in other words , we can compute the total cross section via a convolution of the partonic cross section and the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) @xmath6 .",
    "several interesting questions arise when one tries to think what happens beyond the leading order .",
    "for example , it s not known how to treat events of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disg ] , where one of the colliding partons ( say a quark ) radiates a gluon just before the collision .",
    "now the quark - gluon separation is not necessarily large , and the pair may scatter coherently . what is the correct description of such _ rescattering _ processes , and what is the resulting effect on the total t - scattering cross section ?",
    "a related question is : which factorization scale @xmath7 should we choose in the computation of the total cross section ?",
    "as is well known , qcd - initiated processes have significant higher - order logarithmic corrections , associated with the collinear qcd radiation off initial partons . by choosing @xmath7 appropriately , these corrections can and should be reabsorbed into the pdf . as we will see below ,",
    "the familiar choice @xmath8 is likely not the right one for the t - scattering .",
    "if so , we would like to see this explicitly .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer the above - mentioned questions .",
    "we will be focusing on the qcd radiation since it is the dominant phenomenological effect due to the relative largeness of @xmath9 . however , our methods are equally applicable to the radiation of photons or any other spin 1 gauge bosons .",
    "we also hope that these methods may later prove useful in the more complicated problem of _ gravitational _ radiation emitted in t - scattering , and in particular to provide an alternative to the existing computations which are limited to the case when the emitted radiation is _ soft _ @xcite,@xcite .",

    "this deviates from the familiar prescription @xmath20 .",
    "an intuitive justification for this scale in terms of the typical impact parameter was given in @xcite , but we would like to check it via a direct computation .",
    "the first step is to be able to evaluate the amplitude for small - angle t - scattering accompanied by collinear qcd radiation . in the resummation approach @xcite,@xcite",
    ", this computation seems prohibitively difficult even for one - gluon emission .",
    "indeed , the eikonal amplitude for quark - quark t - scattering is a sum of an infinite number of crossed ladder gravition exchanges .",
    "the outgoing gluon may be attached anywhere on the quark lines , both external and internal . moreover , in the @xmath21 splitting , the emitted near - collinear gluon is not necessarily soft , and thus may also exchange gravitons .",

    "t hooft s approach is a much better starting point .",
    "as we point out , it can be easily ` upgraded ' to the case when radiation is present , provided that only one of the two colliding particles radiates .",
    "this covers completely lepton - quark scattering and is an important special case for quark - quark scattering .",
    "the idea is very simple . in the @xmath10 scattering ,",
    "t hooft treated one particle classically , the other one quantum mechanically .",
    "the only new twist is to allow the quantum particle to radiate . in other words",
    ",  we should treat the non - radiating parton classically , while the radiating parton _ and the gluonic radiation field with which it interacts _ quantum mechanically .",
    "this trick reduces the problem to a quantum field theory computation in the classical gravitational background produced by a relativistic point particle , the aichelburg - sexl ( as ) shock wave @xcite . in section [ sec : qft ] we develop the necessary formalism .",
    "we first consider the simplest perturbative quantum field theory in the as background : a scalar field with cubic self - interactions .",
    "we introduce a diagram technique for computing arbitrary transition amplitudes in this theory , which turns out to be closely related to the standard rules of light - cone perturbation theory in flat space .",
    "we then explain the changes necessary for the gluon field and for the scalar - gluon interactions , and compute the one - gluon emission amplitude as an example .",
    "notice that while fermionic matter fields can be considered analogously , we do not include them in this work in order to keep technical details to a minimum .",
    "thus we stick to a toy model in which the partonic constituents of colliding hadron(s ) are scalars .",
    "armed with the knowledge of gluon emission amplitudes , in section [ sec : qcdeffects ] we attack the question of qcd corrections to t - scattering . for definiteness and simplicity ,",
    "we consider the gravitational analogue of the dis : a transplanckian electron - proton collision .",
    "the observable is the total cross section as a function of the bjorken @xmath22 and the transverse momentum transfer @xmath23 , in the small - angle region @xmath24 . at leading order ( lo ) in the qcd coupling @xmath9 ,",
    "the partons scatter elastically on the electron ( no gluon emission ) . at next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    ", we demonstrate the appearance of logarithmic corrections whose scale is precisely the @xmath25 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) .",
    "we find that the cross section factorizes , in the sense that  these logarithms appear multiplied by the dglap splitting functions , and can be reabsorbed into the pdfs . finally , we are able to show that this factorization holds to all orders in @xmath9 , in the leading - logarithm approximation ( lla ) .",
    "our computation gives an explicit check for the validity of the partonic picture for the t - scattering .",
    "moreover , it gives an interesting and unexpected explanation for why the pdf scale deviates from the usual @xmath26 .",
    "it turns out that rescatterings like in fig .",
    "[ fig : disg ] _ suppress the initial state qcd radiation at transverse momenta _ @xmath27 . as a result",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of emitted gluons has the form:@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the standard distribution without rescattering , and @xmath30 is a function interpolating between @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "logarithmic corrections to the cross section are obtained , as usual , by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn ] ) over the gluon phase space , and the scale of these logarithms is a geometric mean of @xmath35 and @xmath36 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : dn ] ) contains more information than the identification of the correct factorization scale .",
    "the predicted suppression of the initial state radiation is @xmath11-dependent and could in principle be used to determine the number of extra dimensions .    a crucial insight into the physics of radiative processes",
    "is obtained by going into the impact parameter representation . in this picture , we find that the scattering is described via a multi - particle wavefunction of the virtual state ( parton@xmath40radiated quanta ) , which is multipled by individual eikonal factors when crossing the shock wave .",
    "this interpretation suggests a possible generalization of our formalism to the case when both colliding partons radiate , which we discuss in section [ sec : simul ] .    in conclusion",
    ", this work shows that factorization holds for qcd effects in t - scattering , and that the factorization scale has a nontrivial dependence on @xmath41 , in agreement with the earlier proposal of ref .",
    "the novelty is that we arrive at these results by a concrete computation , and that we derive the modified distribution of the initial state radiation due to rescattering effects .",
    "the new distribution should be now incorporated into a ` transplanckian parton shower algorithm ' , to be used in monte - carlo simulations of t - scattering .",
    "we will come back to this issue in a future publication .",
    "in this section we review the basics of small angle t - scattering in the eikonal approximation . we will work within the large flat extra dimensions scenario of tev - scale gravity @xcite , see @xcite for the current experimental constraints .",
    "consider then two transplanckian massless standard model ( sm ) particles , thus confined to the sm 3-brane , which scatter due to the @xmath13-dimensional gravitational field , @xmath42 , @xmath11 being the number of large extra dimensions , @xmath43 for phenomenological reasons .",
    "for now we ignore all interactions except for gravity .",
    "in particular , we suppose that the colliding particles are not charged , and thus can not emit photons or gluons .",
    "we are interested in the scattering amplitude for small momentum transfer @xmath44 in this regime gravitational radiation is also suppressed ( see @xcite ) , and we have elastic @xmath10 scattering .      the most direct way to compute the amplitude is by resumming the crossed ladder graviton exchange diagrams @xcite,@xcite , see fig .",

    "the amplitude acquires the eikonal form:@xmath50 with the eikonal phase @xmath51 given by the fourier transform of the born amplitude in the transverse plane:@xmath52    to evaluate the eikonal phase , we need to regulate the divergent born amplitude ( [ eq : born ] ) . in @xcite ,",

    "is dominated by a characteristic impact parameter @xmath74 , corresponding to the above saddle point . in this case the particle trajectory is well defined and the t - scattering is truly semiclassical , with many gravitons being exchanged .",

    "an alternative derivation , by directly solving the klein - gordon equation , is given in appendix [ sec : gluonas ] .",
    "thus , t hooft s method is equivalent to the resummation .",
    "this is not surprising , because the external field approximation in quantum field theory resums precisely crossed ladder diagrams @xcite .",
    "the as shock wave is a solution to both linearized gravity and the full nonlinear einstein s equations .",
    "in retrospect , this explains why the diagrams in which gravitons emitted by particles @xmath76 and @xmath75 interact did not have to be taken into account in the resummation method .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion and comparison of the two methods in @xmath98 .",
    "still , an attentive reader will notice two small differences between the two results .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eikr ] ) contains @xmath99 under the integral sign , while t hooft s method gives a pure phase .",
    "this is the usual difference between the s- and t - matrices , @xmath100 .",
    "second , the amplitude ( [ eq : eikr ] ) is relativistically normalized , while in the new derivation normalization needs yet to be determined .",
    "modulo the normalization issue ( which will be resolved in section [ sec : scalar ] below ) , the power of t hooft s method relative to the resummation is quite evident . the eikonal phase is given a simple physical interpretation  it is related to the time delay experienced by geodesics upon crossing the shock wave .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath101 emerges as a whole rather than by summing infinitely many individually large terms .",
    "if tev - scale gravity is the way of nature , then transplanckian collisions may be within the energy reach of the lhc .",
    "moreover , transplanckian collisions may be constantly happening in the atmosphere , between the atmospheric nucleons and high - energy cosmic rays ( @xmath102 gev for @xmath103 gev of the order of the gzk cutoff ) . in case of cosmic ray neutrinos this signal could actually be observable .    since protons are not elementary particles , the theory of small angle t - scattering from section [ sec : review ] should be applied instead to @xmath10 collisions between the partonic constituents .",
    "notice that since we are dealing with cm energies well over a tev , the typical momentum transfers will be hard compared to the qcd scale , even though the scattering angle has to be small for the eikonal approximation to be valid .",
    "thus the collision resolves the internal structure of the proton(s ) , and the partonic picture is applicable @xcite .",
    "viewed another way , when two protons collide , there is a phase factor @xmath104 for each pair of partons moving in the opposite directions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] .",
    "this factor tends to zero rapidly at transverse separations @xmath105 , where @xmath106 gev)@xmath56 for t - scattering at the lhc energies .",
    "since partons are distributed in the disk of radius @xmath107gev@xmath108 , it is unlikely that more than one pair will undergo a hard collision .",
    "we would like to briefly mention which observables one usually computes in phenomenological studies . in @xmath109 collisions",
    "one is mostly interested in the total interaction cross section as a function of the energy transfer to the proton @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we will discuss a similar observable in section [ sec : qcdeffects ] below . on the other hand , in the @xmath110 collisions at the lhc one studies two jet final states of high invariant mass , produced at a small angle to the beam @xcite,@xcite ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : dispp ] .",
    "these jets originate from all possible parton pairs @xmath111 ) with the same partonic cross section , the eikonal amplitude being independent of the particle spin . for @xmath112 not much above a tev , the dijet t - scattering signal turns out to be visible over the qcd background .",
    "so far it may look that from the point of view of qcd , the t - scattering is just like any other hard process .",
    "let us however discuss which parton distribution factorization scale @xmath7 one should use when evaluating the t - scattering cross sections  a necessary prerequisite for any practical computation .    for the usual hard processes , we are accustomed to the choice @xmath113 , but for the t - scattering this turns out to be more subtle . as we discussed in section [ sec : resum ] , t - scattering becomes semiclassical in the region of large momentum transfers @xmath114 . in this regime ,",
    "the transverse distance characterizing the process is the typical impact parameter @xmath115 which is _ parametrically larger _ than @xmath116 .",
    "it is for this reason that ref .",

    "even for hard momentum transfers , for sufficiently high @xmath2 the factorization scale will come down to a gev , signalling a breakdown of the partonic picture . at even higher cm energies ( which are well beyond the range of lhc or even cosmic ray collisions ) , the proton should interact gravitationally as a point particle . ]",
    "the above is a summary of the current understanding of qcd effects in t - scattering .",
    "clearly , it is based mostly on intuition .",
    "we would like to develop a systematic theory of these phenomena .",
    "in particular , such a theory should allow to check the factorization scale proposal by a concrete computation .",
    "we have to evaluate the leading log corrections to the t - scattering cross section due to the initial state radiation emission , and to show that they can be absorbed into a shift of the pdf factorization scale .",
    "since @xmath7 is conjectured to have a nontrivial dependence on @xmath35 , some nontrivial physics is likely to come out .",
    "two equivalent methods were given in section [ sec : review ] to describe t - scattering without radiation .",
    "which one shall we try to generalize to the case when radiation is present ?    for the resummation method , generalization does not seem to be easy , not even for the one - gluon emission . think about infinitely many crossed - ladder diagrams , infinitely many places to attach the gluon line , and the necessity to take into account the gravitational exchanges of the emitted gluon !    for t hooft s method , on the other hand , the situation looks hopeful : if only particle @xmath75 radiates , it is quite clear how to include its radiation .",
    "namely , we should keep working in the classical gravitational background created by particle @xmath76 , but switch from relativistic quantum mechanics ( wavefunctions , the klein - gordon equation ) to quantum field theory ( green s functions and interaction vertices ) .",

    "( [ eq : fint ] ) not from the asymptotics of @xmath276 but directly from the definition of @xmath268 in the impact parameter representation . since the @xmath289 norm of the gluon wavefunction is the same in the momentum and in the position space , we have@xmath290 the only subtlety is that in the lhs we are not integrating over the whole @xmath221 plane , and thus the limits of the @xmath264 intergration have to be adjusted accordingly .",
    "a moment s thought shows that the correct limits should be put at the typical @xmath264 values contributing to @xmath268 at @xmath291 and @xmath292 : @xmath293 so , we recover the same logarithm as above , and this time @xmath288 enters explicitly .",
    "we have worked throughout in the toy model of scalar quarks .",
    "however , it should be easy to adapt our considerations to the realistic case of fermionic matter .",
    "one would have to compute the shock wave crossing vertex for the fermion field .",
    "this will require solving the dirac equation in the shock wave background .",
    "we expect that our results about factorization and suppression of radiation at large angles will remain true in the fermionic case as well .",
    "so far we were making the technical simplifying assumption that particle @xmath76 does  not qcd - radiate .",
    "this is of course not true in @xmath110 collisions at the lhc , when both colliding partons are colored .",
    "we will now discuss how one could relax or remove this restriction .",
    "consider the following two key properties of qcd radiation :    1 .",
    "near - collinear emission dominates .",
    "2 .   its amplitude takes a factorized form .",
    "these properties are true for the standard hard perturbative processes . for the t - scattering with non - radiating @xmath76 ,",
    "we have also shown them to be true , provided that a gluon emission factor is adjusted accordingly .",
    "we conjecture that these properties continue to hold when both @xmath76 and @xmath75 are allowed to radiate . in practice",
    ", this implies that the dominant part of the emitted radiation can be described using the independent emission approximation :  first compute the radiation off @xmath75 ( taking @xmath76 classical ) , then off @xmath76 ( taking @xmath75 classical ) .",
    "intuitively , this can be justified as follows .",
    "the fact that the near - collinear emission dominates is due to the @xmath294 singularity in the gluon emission factor , combined with a phase space cutoff @xmath295 we have seen that shock wave crossing tends only to suppress radiation at large angles by distorting the gluon wavefunction , and we do not expect this tendency to reverse when @xmath76 is allowed to radiate .",
    "thus collinear radiation should dominate also for the t - scattering . once we know that collinear emission dominates , and thus the emitted radiation does not change the hard transverse momentum flow of the process , it seems reasonable that the amplitude should factorize into the product of the @xmath10 scattering with the hardest momentum exchange times the gluon emission factors .",
    "the independent emission approximation is probably adequate for most practical purposes .",
    "nevertheless , to try to go beyond it is an interesting theoretical challenge .",
    "we will now describe pictorially a generalization of our formalism which , we believe , can describe simultaneous emissions from @xmath76 and @xmath75 without any extra approximation ( except , of course , large cm energy and small scattering angle ) .    the starting point is the emission amplitude in the impact parameter representation  ( [ eq : miimp ] ) ( see appendix [ sec : multi ] for its generalizations to two and more gluons ) .",
    "the physical meaning of this equation in terms of the two - particle wavefunction and individual eikonal factors was explained above .",
    "suppose now that both particles split .",
    "the amplitude can be constructed according to the following three steps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ab ] ) .    1 .",
    "we evolve the partons from infinity to the transverse plane @xmath296 where the collision is assumed to happen .",
    "we introduce many - particle wavefunctions for the splitting products of both @xmath76 and @xmath75 .",
    "the total wavefunction in the transverse collision plane is the product of the two:@xmath297 here @xmath298 @xmath299 are the transverse coordinates of left- and right - movers . the @xmath300 can be computed via the flat - space light cone perturbation theory .",
    "for the one - gluon emission they are the same as in ( [ eq : miimp ] ) .",
    "when the splitting products cross the transverse collision plane , the wavefunction @xmath301 is multiplied with eikonal factors , one for each pair of opposite - movers .",
    "it is not difficult to guess that these factors are equal to @xmath302 where @xmath51 is the @xmath10 eikonal phase from ( [ eq : eikr ] ) , and @xmath303 , @xmath304 are the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by partons @xmath305 and @xmath0 .",
    "3 .   finally , to find s - matrix elements , we compute the overlap with the outgoing state wavefunctions .",
    "these are simple plane waves if the partons do not undergo any splittings after the shock wave crossings .",
    "if such splittings are present , like in part ( i ) of ( [ eq:1 g ] ) , these are more complicated functions of external momenta . however , since at this stage left- and right - movers no longer interact , the flat - space light cone perturbation theory can be used to find them .    _ _ , in which both the right - moving _ _",

    "split before colliding .",
    "_ , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we think that this generalized formalism , apart from providing an attractive mental picture , could find interesting future applications , especially in the problem of gravitational radiation emission .",
    "the main point of this paper is that including radiation in small - angle transplanckian scattering is , after all , a tractable problem .",
    "the gravitational interaction producing eikonal phase factors happens instantaneously , while the processes of particle splitting are spread in time .",
    "based on this observation , we developed a formalism which allows explicit computations of scattering amplitudes in presence of hard , quantum , radiation . in the impact parameter representation , the radiating particle splits into a multi - particle virtual state , whose wavefunction , computed via light - cone perturbation theory , is then multiplied by individual eikonal factors .",
    "we demonstrated the usefulness of our formalism on the concrete problem of initial state qcd radiation in transplanckian scattering .",
    "we will not repeat here the detailed discussion of the obtained results given in the introduction and in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we believe however that this example by no means exhausts the list of possible applications .",
    "we are particularly hopeful about a possibility to shed new light on the problem of gravitational radiation emission , which is always on our mind .",

    "we thus have to show that the amplitude to emit a longitudinally polarized gluon is zero , without inclusion of any extra terms localized on the shock wave .",
