    "in quantum state identification @xcite the task is to identify the state of a quantum system , prepared with certain prior probability in a definite state out of a finite set of possible states , where some or all of the states are unknown .",
    "the unknown states are encoded into different reference copies , which together have been introduced as the program register in a programmable machine @xcite for identifying the state of the probe , carrying the data .",
    "we assume that the states to be identified are qudits , defined in a @xmath1-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "identifying an unknown probe state means to find the particular reference copy whose state matches the state of the probe .",
    "for this purpose a measurement for quantum state discrimination @xcite has to be performed on the combined system , composed of the probe qudit and the reference qudits , where due to the averaging with respect to the unknown states the combined system is described by a mixed state .",
    "because of the specific symmetry properties inherent in the different states of the combined system , they can be discriminated in spite of the complete lack of knowledge about the unknown states .    in general the states of the combined system",
    "are not orthogonal , which implies that their discrimination and hence the identification of the state of the probe can not be perfect . for discriminating nonorthogonal",
    "states a number of optimal strategies have been developed , which are optimized with respect to various figures of merits .",
    "the best known of these strategies are discrimination with minimum error @xcite , where every time a measurement is performed a decision about the state is made , and optimal unambiguous discrimination @xcite , where errors are not allowed , at the expense of admitting inconclusive results the probability of which is minimized .    the problem of quantum state identification has been first introduced for the optimal unambiguous identification of two unknown pure qubit states @xcite .",
    "the investigations have been soon extended to minimum - error identification @xcite , and generalizations have been also performed to take into account that more than one copy may be available for the probe system and the two reference systems @xcite , including the case that the two unknown states are mixed @xcite . for two unknown pure qudit states with hilbert space dimension @xmath7 , minimum - error identification has been studied for arbitrary prior probabilities of the states @xcite , while the maximum overall success probability for unambiguous identification has been obtained in the case when the states are equally probable @xcite .",
    "a variant of the state identification problem , where for @xmath8 one of the two pure states is known and the other is unknown , has also been studied @xcite . in addition , for two unknown qubit states the case where some classical knowledge is available has been treated @xcite , and a modified identification strategy with a fixed error rate has been investigated @xcite .",
