    "techniques borrowed from gibbs - boltzmann or _ extensive _ thermodynamics play important role in the characterization of complex behaviour exhibited by dynamical systems .",
    "analogous notions of entropy , temperature , pressure and free energy can be applied to quantify the fractal or multifractal attractors of chaotic nonlinear mappings @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact , thermodynamic theory of multifractals is applicable to any arbitrary probability distribution irrespective of its mode of generation .",
    "a useful strategy here is the following : for the given probability distribution @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is bit number , form another set of normalized distributions @xmath4 , called escort distributions of order @xmath5 . for different @xmath5 values , the new distributions are better able to scan different features of the original distribution @xmath6 . now in standard thermodynamics , maximizing the shannon - boltzmann entropy @xmath7 under the constraint of given mean value of internal energy , one obtains the canonical distribution , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is equivalent to helmholtz free energy and @xmath10 is the partition function . in chaos theory , the escort distribution is also sought in a generalized canonical form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "thus in thermodynamic analogy , positive bit number @xmath3 is equivalent to energy @xmath14 , @xmath5 plays the role of inverse temperature and @xmath15 is a generalized free energy .",
    "knowing the partition function is the first step to the study of analogous thermodynamic quantities and relations in chaos theory .",
    "the analogy goes deeper and interesting phenomena like phase transitions have been highlighted in dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it has been realized in recent years that the extensive formalism of thermodynamics fails to yield testable results ( such as finite valued expressions for response functions of the various thermodynamic quantities ) for systems with long - range interactions or which evolve with multifractal space - time constraints or have long term memory effects @xcite . to deal with such cases , a nonextensive formalism of statistical thermodynamics",
    "was proposed by tsallis @xcite .",
    "this formalism has many successful applications to its credit by now , and the importance of nonextensive behaviour has been shown for diverse kinds of systems : lvy anomalous diffusion @xcite , stellar polytropes @xcite , pure - electron plasma two dimensional turbulence @xcite , solar neutrinos @xcite , inverse bremsstrahlung in plasma @xcite , to name a few @xcite .",
    "generally , this formalism is based on the proposal of a non - logarithmic entropy s_q(p ) = = _ i [ b_i ] p_i^q . [ a ] here , @xmath16 $ ] may just be considered as notation for the generalized bit number within the nonextensive framework . for @xmath17 , @xmath16 \\to   b_i = -{\\rm ln}\\;p_i$ ] and eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) gives the shannon entropy .",
    "tsallis entropy is pseudo - additive ( nonextensive ) with respect to subsystems whose joint probabilities factorise : if @xmath18 , then @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath20 represents the deviation from extensivity .",
    "maximising tsallis entropy under the internal energy constraint @xmath21 yields the equilibrium tsallis distribution @xcite p_i^(eq ) = , where @xmath5 is the inverse temperature . for @xmath17 , we get back the canonical distribution .",
    "it is believed that tsallis formalism is a natural frame to study systems with fractal structures @xcite .",
    "indeed the form of tsallis entropy was inspired from multifractal ideas @xcite .",
    "also its connection with a scale - invariant thermostatistics has been conjectured @xcite .",
    "simple relations exist between @xmath22 and characteristic exponents of levy flight distributions and anomalous diffusion @xcite .",
    "recently , a precise relation was proposed between @xmath22 and multifractal scaling properties of critical attractors of nonlinear one - dimensional maps @xcite . for such cases , at the onset of chaos",
    ", the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions is replaced by power law sensitivity , and generalizaton of kolmogorov - sinai entropy has to be invoked on the lines of tsallis formalism @xcite .    realizing the clear signatures of nonextensivity in chaotic dynamical systems",
    ", we feel a nonextensive thermodynamic approach needs to be developed for such systems . in this paper",
    ", we develop the thermostatistics of such a formalism .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we present our formalism by first writing the partition function , then seeking its thermodynamic limit . by generalizing the rnyi dimensions , we establish the legendre transform structure . in section iii , we present as an application , the calculation of bit variance within nonextensive framework . in section iv",
    ", we discuss the relation between box size ( degree of coarse graining ) and degree of nonextensivity ( 1-q ) .",
    "section v is devoted to conclusions and outlook .",
    "our approach is to work with escort distributions which are now sought not in canonical form , but as generalized tsallis distribution . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a general , nonextensive statistics given by p_i = \\{1-(1-q)}^1/(1-q ) .",
    "[ b ] for @xmath23 , this gives the relation between @xmath6 and generalized bit number @xmath16 $ ] in tsallis statistics ( see eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) ) . also for @xmath17 , @xmath24 , which corresponds to extensive statistics .",
    "now the escort distribution for the given distribution of eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) is p_i = = , [ b2 ] which is a generalized tsallis distribution ( see eq . ( 2 ) ) , where now @xmath16 $ ] plays the role of energy @xmath14 .",
    "the generalized partition function , @xmath25\\}^{1/(1-q)}}$ ] .",
    "again for @xmath23 , escort distribution @xmath26 is identical to original distribution @xmath6 .",
    "note that in general , both the original distribution and the escort distribution depend on @xmath5 .",
    "now an important feature of tsallis formalism is that it retains much of the formal structure of standard thermodynamics , including legendre transform structure @xcite .",
    "this is facilitated by a generalization of the logarithm function as _",
    "q = - ln_qz_q ( ) = - .",
    "[ c ] with the aid of such modified logarithm ( or conversely , the exponential function ) , we develop the nonextensive thermostatistics of multifractals .",
    "let us consider a certain nonlinear mapping over one - dimensional ( for simplicity ) phase space which has been partitioned into boxes of equal size @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath6 represent visiting frequency of the map for a box @xmath27 .",
    "then we define local crowding indices as _ i(,q)= , [ e ] which for @xmath17 , can be written as @xmath28 . from eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) and ( [ e ] ) , we may write = _ i(,q)v , [ f ] where @xmath29 , is the extensive volume parameter in thermodynamic analogy .      to derive @xmath30 or @xmath31 limit of the generalized partition function , we replace the sum in @xmath32 by an integral over @xmath33 @xcite , z_q=__min^_max d ( ) ( 1-(1-q)v)^1/(1-q ) , where @xmath34 are the number of boxes with @xmath35 in the interval @xmath36 , @xmath37 $ ] . now in extensive case , @xmath38 is assumed to scale as @xmath39 . in the nonextensive case , this can be generalized as @xmath40 .",
    "thus we finally obtain z_q=__min^_max d \\{(1+(1-q)f()v ) ( 1-(1-q)v)}^1/(1-q ) .",
    "it is useful to remember that the intergrand above is in a sense , nonextensive generalization of the function @xmath41 in the extensive case . now applying the saddle point method for the case of large @xmath42",
    ", we may write the above integral as z_q=\\{(1+(1-q)f()v ) ( 1-(1-q)v)}^1/(1-q ) , [ k ] where @xmath33 corresponds to the maximum value of the integrand for given @xmath5 value .",
    "then using eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , we can write = ( -f())-(1-q)f()v . [ siq ] now in the limit @xmath43 , the last term above diverges . to keep the generalized free energy density finite",
    ", we assume that ( 1-q)~. [ bxq ] then eq .",
    "( [ siq ] ) is given by _",
    "0 ~(-f ( ) ) - f().note that the first term in parentheses is same as obtained for the extensive case .",
    "the second term arises due to the nonextensive nature of the present formalism .",
    "also it may be noted that if we assume volume parameter @xmath42 to be positive definite , then @xmath44 .",
    "next , we propose to generalize the usual rnyi dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is required to discuss legendre transform structure of the present formalism .",
    "we define d_q()= _ 0 _ q(_i p_i^ ) .",
    "[ db1 ] again assuming the validity of eq .",
    "( [ bxq ] ) for @xmath45 , in the @xmath30 limit , we get d_q ( ) = ( ( _ i p_i^)^1-q-1 ) . [ p ] for @xmath46 , the last term of the eq .",
    "( [ siq ] ) vanishes and thus , eq . ( [ bxq ] ) can not be inferred . then using eq .",
    "( [ db1 ] ) and @xmath47 , we get @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number of nonempty boxes . also for @xmath50 ,",
    "( [ p ] ) gives @xmath51 .",
    "to see the behaviour for large @xmath5 , we write from eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) and ( [ f ] ) ^ = \\{1-(1-q)_i v}^1/(1-q ) .",
    "again in the limit of box size @xmath30 , we assume the scaling form eq .",
    "( [ bxq ] ) and write ^ = \\{1-_i } ^1/(1-q ) . for very large values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the above expression is dominated by minimum value of @xmath33 . using this condition in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) , we can write d_q ( ) = _ min , which for @xmath52 yields @xmath53 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath54 , one can show @xmath55 .",
    "these results are thus identical to those obtained for the usual rnyi dimensions .",
    "now from eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) , we write z_q=_i p_i^=\\{1 + ( ) d_q()}^1/(1-q ) .",
    "[ q ] using eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) with @xmath56 , and eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) , we get ( -1)d_q ( ) = -(1-)f ( ) , [ r ] which we choose to write as _ q()=-f_q ( ) , [ lts ] where we define @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we find that = , = .",
    "we note @xmath59 being equivalent to the generalized free energy @xmath60 ( that already obeys legendre transform structure ) , is a concave function of its argument . then from eq .",
    "( [ lts ] ) , we infer that @xmath61 is also a concave function , implying that the legendre transform structure is well defined .",
    "an alternative method to characterize multifractal statistics is using bit moments and bit cumulants of escort distributions @xcite .",
    "particularly , the second bit cumulant ( @xmath62 ) measures the variance of bit number . in the following ,",
    "we derive expression for bit variance within the generalized statistical framework and apply it to ergodic logistic map . for nonextensive case , we write generalized second bit cumulant for escort distribution @xmath63 as ^(q)(p ) = -^2 & = & q\\{(_ip_i^)^-q(_i [ b_i]^2 p_i^(2q-1 ) ) + & & -(_ip_i^)^-q-1(_i[b_i ] p_i^q)^2 } .",
    "the corresponding quantity for the original distribution ( @xmath50 ) is given by ^(q)(p ) = - _ = 1 = q\\{_i [ b_i]^2 p_i^(2q-1 ) -(_i [ b_i ] p_i^ q)^2}. [ gam ] note that for @xmath17 , we have @xmath64 . for the case of ergodic maps , bit variance density which is equivalent to heat capacity is given as @xmath65 @xcite , where @xmath66 is the natural invariant density of the map .",
    "for the nonextensive case , we find c_2^(q ) = ( ^(2q-1)-^ q ^2 ) . in fig . 1",
    ", we plot @xmath67 and @xmath68 against the nonlinearity parameter @xmath69 for the logistic map , @xmath70 .",
    "we find that for @xmath71 , the bit variance ( which represents size of fluctuations in bit number ) @xmath68 is larger than the quantity @xmath67 of extensive case .",
    "we present an interpretation of this result in the next section .",
    "we also find quite an interesting feature _",
    "i.e. _ the general trend of @xmath67 vs. @xmath69 curve , evaluated at smaller box size can be matched by @xmath68 evaluated at arbitrarily larger box size and appropriate value of @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show two cases to corroborate this point . quite remarkably , the two quantities show matching for a wide range of the parameter @xmath69 . to be precise , we note that decreasing the box size , lifts the heat capacity curve @xmath67 . again",
    ", @xmath72 also results in a general increase in heat capacity @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "thus we can expect that heat capacity results with @xmath73 and smaller box size are reproduced with @xmath72 and larger box size .",
    "this implies that a range of @xmath22 and @xmath0 values exist , which yield the same value for @xmath68 . in the following ,",
    "we make use of this possibility .",
    "an important assumption in the above which makes the whole thermodynamic formalism consistent , is the relation between box size @xmath0 and the degree of nonextensivity @xmath20 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ bxq ] ) .",
    "note that this relation is for an escort distribution of order @xmath5 .",
    "for the original distribution , @xmath50 and we have @xmath74 . in the following , we numerically check the valdity of this scaling form .",
    "again we consider the example of section iii . for exactness",
    ", we now focus on a fixed value of nonlinearity parameter @xmath75 in the chaotic region .",
    "the way we go about this exercise is as follows : for a given value of @xmath22 and box size @xmath0 , we calculate @xmath76 .",
    "then we vary both @xmath22 and @xmath0 , so that we obtain same value of @xmath76 within good approximation .",
    "3 shows that a direct proportionality in fact exists between @xmath20 and @xmath77 , for very small @xmath0 .",
    "one can look for the origin of the proposed relation between @xmath20 and @xmath0 , in the definition of tsallis entropy itself .",
    "thus consider a unit interval divided into @xmath78 number of equal sized boxes .",
    "assuming equiprobability , we have @xmath79",
    ". then tsallis entropy for this ditribution is given by @xmath80 . again keeping @xmath81 fixed , we vary @xmath22 and @xmath0 and as shown in fig .",
    "4 , find that the proposed scaling form @xmath82 is justified for large @xmath42 .",
    "finally , we make a remark on the results of fig .",
    "1 . how do we interpret the higher values of @xmath76 over @xmath83 for @xmath72 in terms of effects of nonextensivity ?",
    "in the present context , we look at this issue from the viewpoint of inherent correlations due to nonextensivity .",
    "it is known that if the bit cumulants of subsystems , deviate from additivity , this indicates the presence of correlations .",
    "this happens naturally for the nonextensive case , where _",
    "e.g. _ the first bit cumulant , @xmath84 is identical to tsallis entropy and hence is nonadditive with respect to statistically independent subsystems .",
    "tsallis entropy is superextensive for @xmath71 , i.e. the entropy of composite system is _ larger _ than the sum of entropies of individual subystems .",
    "this implies that negative correlations are set up for @xmath71 .",
    "we propose that the overall increase in bit variance for the nonextensive case above , reflects these implicit correlations . in the thermodynamic limit of @xmath85",
    ", the proportionality between @xmath20 and @xmath86 suggests that @xmath87 .",
    "thus these correlations can be expected to be suppressed in this limit .",
    "such correlations have also been studied in the context of classical ideal gas model within nonextensive framework @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we presented a nonextensive generalization of thermostatistics of dynamical systems .",
    "we have seen that in the thermodynamic limit , generalized free energy density is finite if we assume direct proportionality between @xmath20 and @xmath86 .",
    "this relation also plays important role in exhibiting the legendre transform structure .",
    "we have numerically shown the validity of this relation for generalized bit variance and from the definition of tsallis entropy itself .",
    "we know finite partitioning of the phase space is a fact of life in the study of chaotic systems . that this feature can be related to @xmath20 ,",
    "provides a new insight into the nature of nonextensivity .",
    "further development of the formalism treating boxes with variable size , extension to dynamical apsects involving time evolution will be extremely welcome .",
    "it can be hoped that these possible developments will connect with the recent work @xcite , @xcite on low - dimensional dissipative systems and their power law sensitivity to initial conditions at bifurcation points or onset of chaos .",
