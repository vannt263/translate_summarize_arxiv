    "in future collider experiments such as at the lhc and ilc , the standard model will be checked with very high precision and a signal of new physics will be searched for through a tiny difference between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty must be , at least , one order of magnitude smaller than the experimental one .",
    "the theoretical prediction is obtained based on the perturbative calculation of the quantum field theories .",
    "the theoretical calculation of a higher order correction with one- or two - loops must be performed in order to meet with experimental requirements .",
    "a loop integration is one of the critical issues of a computation of these higher order corrections .",
    "basically there are two methods to perform the loop integration , an analytical method and a numerical one .",
    "though the analytical method gives , in principle , fast and stable results , for many cases it is hard to give a compact expression for the one - loop integral and it is very difficult to perform two - loop computations for the standard model with multiple energy scales .",
    "numerical methods have also been investigated to perform loop integrals .",
    "the symmetrical sampling method was proposed in @xcite by oyanagi _",
    "et al . _ in 1988 and has been investigated through a series of papers@xcite .",
    "another numerical method , the hybrid method@xcite , has been proposed .",
    "it is to perform a part of the multi - dimensional integrations analytically up to the integrand being a logarithmic form .",
    "a remaining integration was performed numerically by monte carlo method .",
    "both methods are tuned to calculate up to two - loop / three - point functions with arbitrary masses@xcite .",
    "recently another numerical methods using the sato - bernstein - tkachov ( sbt ) relation is proposed and utilized intensively@xcite .",
    "a recent review of the method using the sbt relation can be found in @xcite .",
    "yet another numerical method has been proposed by de doncker@xcite , an ` @xmath0-algorithm ' .",
    "this method takes the infinitesimal imaginary parameter appearing in a denominator of the loop integral at finite values , and takes its extrapolation to zero .",
    "it is demonstrated that this method can give precise results for a non - scalar one - loop / three - point digram@xcite .",
    "we propose a new method of loop integrations such as a ` numerical contour - integration ( nci ) method ' in this report .",
    "the loop integral can be interpreted as a contour integral in a complex plane for integrands with multi - poles in the plane .",
    "we show that the stable and efficient numerical integrations along an appropriate contour for tensor integrals as well as scalar ones appear in loop calculations of the standard model .",
    "this method is applicable , so far , up to two - loop / three - point functions with arbitrary masses and arbitrary polynomials of feynman parameters in the numerator of the integrand .",
    "the basic idea of this method and some numerical results are shown in this report .",
    "the tensor integral of a massless one - loop n - point graph with rank @xmath1 in a space - time dimension of @xmath2 can be written as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a four momentum of an @xmath6th external particle ( incoming ) , @xmath7 a loop momentum , and @xmath8 the internal masses .",
    "an infinitesimal imaginary part ( @xmath9 ) is included to obtain analyticity of the integral @xmath10 .",
    "the momentum integration can be done using feynman s parameterization which combines the propagators .",
    "after the momentum integration , an ultra - violet pole is subtracted under some renormalization scheme . finally the tensor integral can be expressed using integrals of the type @xmath11   \\frac{x_i\\cdots x_k}{\\left(d_{n}-i0\\right)^{n-2 } } , \\label{ti}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12&=&\\int^1_0 dx_1 \\int^{1-x_1}dx_2 \\cdots \\int^{1-\\sum^{n-1}_{i=1 } x_i } dx_{n-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an explicit form of the numerator , and a relation between @xmath10 and @xmath13 , can be obtained straightforwardly depending on the diagram@xcite .",
    "the remaining task is to perform the parametric integration of @xmath13 in eq.([ti ] ) , which is called a _",
    "tensor integral _ in this report .",
    "( when the numerator of the integrand is unity , it is called a _ scalar integral_. )",
    "a general formula of the tensor integral for the one - loop / three - point function with arbitrary masses is@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15    ( 300,200)(0,0 ) ( 150,180)(150,120 ) ( 50,50)(100,50 ) ( 250,50)(200,50 ) ( 150,120)(100,50 ) ( 100,50)(200,50 ) ( 200,50)(150,120 ) ( 180,160)(0,0)[rc]@xmath16 ( 80,30)(0,0)[rc]@xmath17 ( 260,30)(0,0)[rc]@xmath18 ( 150,35)(0,0)[cc]@xmath19 ( 110,85)(0,0)[cc]@xmath20 ( 190,85)(0,0)[cc]@xmath21    [ 1l3p ]    a numerator of the integrand , @xmath22 , can be any polynomial of feynman parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 with rank @xmath25 . momentum and mass assignments are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the integration region is a 2-dimensional simplex with three sides .",
    "those sides are @xmath26 singular points ( second pole ) of the integrand form a parabola ( or hyperbola ) , which is @xmath27 the focal point of the parabola is on the opposite side of the origin with respect to the parabola line .",
    "when one integration - variable is fixed , the remaining one - parameter integration may intersect a pole on the line @xmath28 .",
    "this integration can be done numerically as a contour integral along an appropriate contour with correct analyticity . for a stable integration",
    ", it must be avoided that the contour intersects more than one pole , or that a pole is at the end point of the contour .",
    "these requirements are satisfied by taking an appropriate coordinate system instead of a simple @xmath29 coordinate of feynman parameters .",
    "basically we take polar - coordinates with an origin on the side @xmath30 .",
    "coordinate systems we used are categorized by the following cases ;    1 .   @xmath31=0",
    "$ ] : + @xmath32 $ ] are number of elements of a set @xmath33 .",
    "there is no singular points in the integration region .",

    "2 .   @xmath34=1 $ ] @xmath35 @xmath36=0 $ ] : + the origin of the coordinate system is set at a point such as @xmath37 .",
    "though a pole is at the origin , the singularity is canceled out against the jacobian on the numerator , i.e. the measure at the origin is zero in the polar - coordinates .",
    "then the integration is free from singularities .",
    "3 .   @xmath34=2 $ ] @xmath35 @xmath36=0 $ ] : + the origin is set at the center of two elements of @xmath37 .",

    "the origins of the coordinate frames are set at the three corner of the simplex , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in each region",
    ", the contour along @xmath38 intersects the line @xmath28 only once for any value of @xmath39 .",
    "we can take an appropriate contour avoiding the pole with correct analyticity .",
    "numerical integrations are performed based on the ` good lattice point ( glp ) method@xcite ' , which uses a deterministic series of numbers . for smooth functions",
    "it shows very efficient convergence compared with a monte carlo integration based on random sampling .",
    "moreover both imaginary and real parts can be integrated simultaneously .    here",

    "the results from the nci method with the glp numerical integration at @xmath52 are shown in table  9 comparing them with those obtained by @xmath53@xcite .",
    "the ten - digit agreement with @xmath53 can be obtained with only four to seven thousand sampling points in the glp .",
    "we have developed a fully numerical method , named ` numerical contour integration ( nci ) ' method , to calculate loop integrals . loop integrals can be interpreted as a contour integral in a complex plane for an integrand with multi - poles in the plane . for the one - loop / three - point case with arbitrary masses in the standard model , both scalar and tensor integrals",

    "the nci method has been applied also to two - loop integrals . for two- and three - point integrals at the two - loop level , it is demonstrated that the nci method can give numerical results of the loop integrals with good accuracy using the monte carlo integration package bases .",
    "those results show a good agreement with previous calculations .",
    "the extension to the general tensor cases is straight forward , since the nci is a purely numerical method .",
