    "the physics of systems of confined particles has attracted the interest of researchers from many different areas working on both , theoretical and experimental aspects @xcite .",
    "one feature of such quantum systems that has recently gained impulse is the study of entropic measures of entanglement @xcite . among the many kind of systems that could be addressed using the physics of the confined systems , in the present work we focus on wigner molecules , which are the finite - size analogue of wigner crystals , named after the seminal work of e. wigner @xcite . since the late 80 s , when the first confined linear chains of ions where reported by d. wineland @xcite",
    ", there has been an increasing capacity to confine , control and manipulate such entities , and has turned the wigner molecules into a new platform to test the known , and look for new , traits of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "trapped ions are not the only physical systems that allow the formation of entities like the wigner molecules ( also named coulomb crystals @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental observation of strongly correlated states in quantum dots has attracted considerable interest @xcite .",
    "wigner molecules have also been observed in two - dimensional semiconductor heteroestructures @xcite , semiconductor quantum dots @xcite , one - dimensional quantum wires @xcite , carbon nanotubes @xcite , and in crystalline states for dusty plasma @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies @xcite have demonstrated that the physics of these systems with reduced dimensionality usually does not depend on the shape of the confinement but on its symmetries and strength ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an example where shape does have an influence ) . in the present work we use a harmonic confinement as a model potential , and represent different physical situations using different interaction potentials .",
    "wigner molecules arise when the interparticle interaction strength is much larger than the kinetic energy .",
    "the latter can be related to the temperature of the system @xcite and also to the density , or confining energy , of the particles @xcite .",
    "hence wigner localization is expected for low density systems or for large interaction strengths .    the calogero and moshinsky models are the most salient examples of analytically solvable models of confined particles , including the exact computation of the entanglement entropies @xcite , in this sense it can also be mentioned the spherium model @xcite , and the quasi - solvable hook model @xcite . in particular , the calogero model has been widely studied in condensed matter physics and has experienced several revivals @xcite , such as the discovery of an explicit relation of the calogero model with the fractionary quantum hall effect @xcite and fractional statistics @xcite . in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we have studied the behavior of the von neumann and rnyi entropies of the one- and two - dimensional calogero model for two particles . by considering anisotropic confinement in the two - dimensional case we showed that the one - dimensional regime is reached when the anisotropy of the trap increases , and we also demonstrated that the rnyi entropies present a non analytical behavior in the neighborhood of those values of the interaction strength parameter for which the reduced density matrix has finite support .",
    "motivated by this , we consider anisotropic harmonic confinement and compute the exact expression for the occupation numbers or occupancies of the two - dimensional ground state wave function in the large interaction strength limit for two particles which interact via different potentials depending on the distance between the particles .",
    "the exact natural orbitals are obtained from the schmidt decomposition of the ground state wave function in the same limit and the occupancies are used to evaluate several quantum information measurements such as von neumann and rnyi entropies in closed form .",
    "the method presented here is a generalization of the strategy developed in refs .",
    "the two particle one - dimensional systems with coulomb and inverse powers interactions are addressed in  @xcite , while the natural orbitals and occupation numbers of elliptically deformed two - dimensional quantum dots are reported in  @xcite .",
    "here we give the analytical expressions of the natural orbitals , occupation numbers , von neumann and rnyi entropies in the strong interaction limit for any potential which depends only on the interparticle distance .",
    "our main purpose is to determine the influence of the anisotropy and the type of interparticle interaction by looking upon the linear , von neumann , min - entropy , max - entropy and rnyi entropies as entanglement measures .",
    "we have a particular interest in which are the differences arising from a short - range interaction with respect to a long range one for which the emergence of wigner molecules has been widely described ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . with this aim , we study two interacting potential cases for each interaction range , including one that can be exactly solved . in the long - range interaction case",
    "we consider the inverse power and the inverse logarithmic potential , and for the short - range interaction we solve the screened inverse power potential and a gaussian repulsive interaction .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the inverse power interaction case is used to model quantum dots @xcite or ion traps @xcite where the large interaction regime can be achieved experimentally due to a strong interaction between the particles or a weak confinement energy scale , for inverse square power one gets the calogero model , while the screened coulomb interaction provides a simple model potential for ions and plasmas @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is discussed in section [ section_2d2p_sys ] . in section [ section_analytical_derivation ]",
    "we show the derivation of the analytical occupancies of two interacting particles in a two - dimensional anisotropic harmonic trap , while in section [ section_entropies ] we calculate the entropic entanglement measures . we discuss the results for long- and short - range interaction potentials in sections [ section_long_range ] and [ section_short_range ] respectively .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusions are presented in section [ section_summary_conclusions ] .",
    "the physics of confined particle systems is nowadays very relevant to understand the many recent experiments conducted in cold atom traps or in quantum dots , at least in a qualitative way @xcite .",
    "the models for those systems contain two contributions to the potential energy : one is given by the trap potential and the other by the interaction between the particles . for small dots , containing few electrons",
    "the trap potential can be approximated by a harmonic one @xcite , therefore we focus here on two interacting particles in a two - dimensional anisotropic harmonic traps , and implement a method to solve the entanglement spectrum in the large interaction limit for arbitrary interaction potentials .",

    "[ f_occupancies_gaussian](a ) ) reach the maximum value @xmath108 for @xmath155 , value at which all the others occupancies vanish as can be appreciated for @xmath164 in fig .",
    "[ f_occupancies_gaussian](b ) .    summarizing , we found that two trapped particles with a gaussian repulsive interaction between them , have a reduced density matrix with infinite support ( infinite non - vanishing occupancies ) for all the interaction strengths but for @xmath155 , value at which all the occupancies vanish except two , and the support is finite .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to notice that the largest occupancy @xmath165 throughout the considered range of @xmath5 values , and the sum of all the remaining occupancies is @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , in the neighborhood of @xmath159 , the two natural orbitals associated to @xmath163 are the main contributions to the spatial wave function expansion .",
    "in this work we present analytical expressions in the large interaction strength limit for the occupancies and quantum entropies for the ground state of a two - particle wigner molecule in a two - dimensional anisotropic harmonic trap .",
    "our main result is that one is able to determine the influence of the anisotropy and the range of the interparticle interaction looking upon the entropic entanglement measures .",
    "the wave function is obtained within the framework of the harmonic approximation for large interaction strength values , and once we have the ground state wave function , we calculate the occupancies from the schmidt decomposition of the reduced density matrix .",
    "we obtain doubly degenerate occupancies , and relate this to the equivalence between particle exchange in the wave function and the exchange between the two minima of the effective potential of the relative hamiltonian .",
    "the linear , von neumann , min - entropy , max - entropy and rnyi entropies are calculated exactly in terms of the occupancies as a function of the anisotropy parameter and the parameters of the interaction potential .",
    "we found that , due to the coordinate separability of the wave function , the von neumann , min - entropy , max - entropy and rnyi entropies are a sum of terms associated to each coordinate , and that only one of these terms depends on the anisotropy parameter and the other term is associated to the interaction potential .",
    "consequently , the behavior of the entropies with respect to the anisotropy parameter can be analyzed without regard of the interaction potential , and the dependence on the interaction potential is entirely defined by the frequency obtained by the harmonic approximation of the one - dimensional problem .",
    "moreover , we generalize these results to dimensions higher than two , see details in the supporting information .    we show that when the frequency remains finite for large interactions , then the von neumann , min - entropy and the family of rnyi entropies remain finite for the anisotropic model and diverge logarithmically for the isotropic model .",
    "the divergence of the entanglement measure entropies of the isotropic model can be understood as follows : in the deformed or anisotropic case the particles locate around the two classical minima of the relative hamiltonian forming a wigner molecule , while for the isotropic model those minima degenerate into a circle , the particles are no longer localized and this lack of information is reflected in the divergence of the entanglement entropies . if the frequency increases monotonously for large interactions then , the von neumann , min - entropy and the family of rnyi entropies diverge logarithmically for any anisotropy parameter . in this sense , the influence of the interaction potential is present only in the one - dimensional entropies .    the previous interaction - independent analysis allows us to apply them to different interactions straightforwardly .",
    "we group the interactions into short and long - range potentials and show the differences of the obtained results between the groups . for long - range interaction potentials ,",
    "the frequencies remain finite in the large interaction strength limit , and the von neumann , min - entropy and rnyi entropies are finite . in contradistinction , for short - range interaction potentials , the frequencies increase monotonously as a function of the interaction strength and , consequently , the one - dimensional von neumann and rnyi entropies diverge in the large interaction strength limit .",
    "the divergence of the entanglement entropies can be explained as arising from the momentum uncertainty divergence at large frequencies .",
    "it is important to mention that the one - dimensional von neumann , min - entropy and rnyi entropies of the inverse power interaction model diverge logarithmically when the power of the inverse interaction increases ( see eqs .",
    "( [ renyi_2d_x ] ) and ( [ sx ] ) ) , since in this limit the interaction between the particles goes to a short range one .",
    "we also demonstrate that when the frequency associated to the interaction potential , satisfy @xmath100 , the entropies have their minimum value equal to unity . actually , the von neumann , min - entropy and rnyi entropies with @xmath101 present an analytical behaviour around this point , while the rnyi entropies with @xmath102 have a non - analytical behaviour , which exposes the finite support of the reduced density matrix . for this particular frequency",
    "there is only two non vanishing occupancies @xmath109 .",
    "similar features were also recently reported by amico and co - workers for @xmath108-spin chains @xcite , and for the calogero model @xcite by the present authors .",
    "we further illustrate these features showing that two trapped particles with a gaussian repulsive interaction have a reduced density matrix with infinite support ( infinite non - vanishing occupancies ) for all hamiltonian parameters except for those values that allow @xmath100 , where all the occupancies vanish except two , and the reduced density matrix has finite support .    as a final remark",
    ", there is a very recent work concerning a system of two coulombically interacting particles confined to a @xmath74 sphere , where the dependence of the entanglement measures on the radius of the system and the spatial dimensionality has been investigated @xcite .",
    "thus , as future perspectives we would like to study the effects of the dimensionality and the interaction strength on the entanglement of two confined particles which interact via a general potential , taking as a starting point the results obtained in the generalization to dimensions higher than two presented in the second section of the supporting information .",
