    "brown dwarfs are sub - stellar objects with mass well below the hydrogen burning limit ( @xmath20.08 m@xmath12 ) , which fill up the gap between stars and planets . with no stable nuclear burning ,",
    "the energy source of brown dwarfs is gravitational contraction , hence brown dwarfs become cooler and less luminous with the increasing ages . _",
    "rosat _ detected x - rays from several brown dwarfs and their candidates in star - forming regions ; chamaeleon , @xmath0 ophiuchi ( @xmath0 oph ) , and taurus @xcite .",
    "x - ray flares from field brown dwarfs were also found @xcite .",
    "these x - ray features are similar to those of low - mass stars , hence the x - rays are likely to be magnetic origin",
    ". however the standard ( @xmath13-@xmath14 ) dynamo to produce the magnetic activity may not present , because brown dwarfs are fully convective , hence there are no anchor points of the magnetic field in the star interior @xcite . in order to address the x - ray features and to study the emission mechanisms of brown dwarfs , our current knowledge is still very poor , due mainly to the limited sensitivity of the previous instruments .",
    "this observational constrain is largely relaxed by the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory of wide band sensitivity ( 0.510.0 kev ) coupled with unprecedented spatial resolution of @xmath20.5@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we systematically search and study x - rays from brown dwarfs in one of the nearest star - forming regions , using the data of two deep acis - i exposures on the @xmath0 oph molecular cloud cores .",
    "two _ chandra _ observations were made on the central region of the @xmath0 oph cloud with the acis - i array consisting of four abutted x - ray ccds . the first observation ( here and after , obs.1 ) covered a 174@xmath6174 area including cores b , c , e , and f , while the second observation ( obs.2 ) covered the center of core a @xcite .",
    "the level 2 data are retrieved from the _ chandra _ x - ray center ( cxc ) archive , in which the data degradation caused by the increase of charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) in orbit is corrected .",
    "x - ray events are selected with the _ asca _ grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "after the processing , @xmath16100 ks effective exposure time is obtained from each observation . the log of the observations is listed in table [ tab : obs ] .    in these two fields ,",
    "18 late m dwarfs have been reported , based on the water vapor absorption at @xmath17 = 2.42.5 @xmath18 m ( wilking , greene , & meyer 1999 ; cushing , tokunaga , & kobayashi 2000 ) . among them , 8 sources have the upper limit of mass less than 0.08 m@xmath12 , which we call `` bona - fide brown dwarfs '' ( here and after , bds ) .",
    "the other 10 sources have a mass in the transition region of 0.08 m@xmath12 , hence called `` candidate brown dwarfs '' ( cbds ) .",
    "their names and spectral types are shown in table [ tab : bds ] .",
    "using the ` wavdetect ` command , we pick up @xmath2100 x - ray sources from each field above the significance criterion of 10@xmath19 . infrared ( ir ) counterparts from the catalog of @xcite",
    "are searched and the position is cross - correlated to that of the x - ray source .",
    "systematic coordinate offset of the _ chandra _ frame is then fine - tuned to fit the ir frame .",
    "after the offset correction , the relative position error ( 1@xmath20 ) is 12 .",
    "we find x - ray counterparts from 5 ir positions in a 2@xmath20 error radius ( 24 ) out of the 18 catalogued bds and cbds ( gy 310 , gy 31 , gy 37 , gy 59 , and gy 326 ) .",
    "the x - ray positions and relative offsets from the ir sources are given in table [ tab : bds ] .",
    "the x - ray counts are extracted from a circle of a half radius of the point - spread function ( psf ) around the x - ray position .",
    "since no apparent x - ray sources are found in a 2@xmath20 error radius ( 24 ) of the other 13 catalogued bds and cbds , we define a circle with a half radius of psf around each ir position",
    ". then we manually count the x - ray photons in the circle .",
    "we note that a rather small source radius is selected so as to maximize the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio , particularly , for faint x - ray sources .",
    "nevertheless , as is demonstrated in the 5 bright sources , the position error between ir and x - rays is always smaller than the source radius , because both have generally similar dependence on the source off - axis angle ; both have the smaller values for the sources with smaller off - axis angle . therefore most of the x - ray photons for the relevant bds and cbds",
    ", if any , may fall in the source circles .",
    "the x - ray flux thus counted are given in table [ tab : bds ] .",
    "the mean background counts are estimated from source - free regions of a 63-arcmin@xmath21 and a 59-arcmin@xmath21 area in the acis - i fields for obs.1 and obs.2 , respectively . the soft band ( 0.52.0 kev ) background counts ( in units of 10@xmath22 counts arcsec@xmath22 ) are 2.3 and 2.2 , for obs.1 and obs .",
    "2 , respectively , while those in the hard ( 2.09.0 kev ) band are about 3 times larger , 6.8 and 6.5 for obs.1 and obs .",
    "the background counts in each source area are given in table 2 .",
    "we then separately calculate the confidence level ( @xmath23 ) of the x - ray detection for the soft , hard and total ( 0.59.0 kev ) bands .",
    "based on the poisson statistics , the @xmath23 is defined as ; @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the detected and the background counts in the source circle , respectively ( see e.g. , gehrels 1986 , and references therein ) .",
    "we set the detection ( or the upper limit ) criterion that the @xmath23 should be larger than 0.999 ( = 3.3@xmath20 ) in any of the 3 energy band data . in table",
    "[ tab : bds ] , we show the maximum @xmath23 value for each source . for sources located in both fields of view ( gy 141 , gy 163 , and gy 202 )",
    ", we also estimate the @xmath23 for the combined data as well as the separate data . however , no higher @xmath23 value is obtained from all the sources .",
    "as are summarized in table [ tab : bds ] , bright x - rays are found from 3 cbds ( gy 31 , gy 37 , and gy 59 ) in addition to previously reported sources , gy 310 and gy 326 ( imanishi , tsuboi , & koyama 2001 ) .",
    "detection of x - rays from a cbd , gy 84 is also highly significant .",
    "another bd , gy 141 in obs.1 , show faint x - rays with @xmath23 of @xmath270.999 in the soft band . using the log@xmath28log@xmath29 relation by @xcite ,",
    "we estimate the chance coincidence of a background source to fall in the source circle to be 0.61 % , where the uncertainty mainly comes from the ambiguity of the amount of interstellar absorption . furthermore , background sources are most likely agns and may have harder spectra than the possible counterpart of gy 141 .",
    "we thus conclude that the faint x - rays from this bd are real .      for the brightest 4 sources ",
    ", 1 bd ( gy 310 ) and 3 cbds ( gy 31 , gy 59 , and gy 326 )  , we analyze the time - averaged x - ray spectra .",
    "the background spectra are extracted from the same regions used in  3.1 .",
    "we then fit the spectra with a thin - thermal plasma ( mekal : mewe , gronenschild , & van den oord 1985 ) model , in which the metal abundance is fixed to 0.3 solar based on the fitting results of other _",
    "chandra _ x - ray sources in this region @xcite .",
    "the spectra and the best - fit parameters are shown in figure [ fig : spec_bright ] and table [ tab : spec_bright ] .",
    "the best - fit plasma temperature ( @xmath30 ) is in the range of 0.92.5 kev .",
    "small differences in the parameters of gy 310 and gy 326 from those in table 1 of @xcite , which is nevertheless unimportant , would be attributed to the more elaborated data - reduction process of this paper ( see  2 in imanishi et al .",
    "2001 ) .    for the faint or non - x - ray sources ,",
    "the spectrum is assumed to be a thin - thermal plasma of 2-kev temperature ( the mean value for the bright sources ) , while the absorption column is estimated from the empirical relation , @xmath4 = 1.59@xmath610@xmath31 @xmath3 cm@xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath3 is the visual extinction derived from ir photometry @xcite .",
    "we then calculate the x - ray luminosities or those of the 99.9 % upper limits in the soft band ( table [ tab : bds ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : lc_bright ] shows the light curves of ( a ) gy 310 , ( b ) gy 31 , ( c ) gy 59 , and ( d ) gy 326 in 0.59.0 kev , where the background levels are represented by the dashed lines . for gy 31 and gy 59 , clear flare - like events , typical to those of low - mass main - sequence and pre - main - sequence stars ; a fast rise and slow decay , are seen .",
    "the flare - decay timescale ( @xmath210@xmath33 sec ) is also the same as that of low - mass stars .",
    "gy 310 and gy 326 , on the other hand , show no clear flare , but exhibit aperiodic variability of flux change by a factor of @xmath22 within 100 ks exposure .",
    "since we see no large intensity variation in the background flux , we conclude that the variability is highly significant .    in order to search for spectral change during the flare , we separately make and fit the spectra of gy 31 in the flare and quiescent phases .",
    "a hint of spectral hardening during the flare is found , although it is not significant from the statistical point of view ; @xmath30 is 2.5@xmath34 kev at the first flare then decreases to 2.1@xmath35 kev in a rather quiescent phases .",
    "we detect x - ray emission from 2 out of 8 bds and 5 out of 10 cbds in the @xmath0 oph cloud cores .",
    "the x - ray detection rate is thus 25% ( bd ) and 50% ( cbd ) .",
    "@xcite claimed the x - ray detection of only 1 bd ( gy202 ) with _",
    "rosat_/pspc , in the same fields of the present observations .",
    "our present observations find no x - ray from gy202 with an upper limit of 1.2@xmath610@xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "instead , we find a class i candidate wl 1 ( no.13 , in imanishi et al .",
    "2001 ) within the pspc error circle of gy202 .",
    "this source emits x - rays with comparable luminosity to that of gy202 reported with _",
    "conversely , @xcite found no x - ray with an upper limit of @xmath210@xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 from all the _ chandra _ detected sources .",
    "they , however , estimated the x - ray luminosity assuming @xmath36 1 kev and @xmath37 a few mag ( i.e. , @xmath4 = a few @xmath610@xmath31 cm@xmath22 ) , which may be significantly lower than the real case ( see table [ tab : spec_bright ] ) .",
    "we hence re - estimate the upper limit with the same assumption adopted in this paper (  3.2 ) , then find that the _ rosat _ upper limit could be nearly one or two order magnitude higher than those of the original paper . if we adopt these newly estimated upper limits , we find no significant flux change from the _ rosat _ to the _ chandra _ era .    in table",
    "[ tab : bds ] , we display the ratio of the x - ray ( @xmath38 ) and bolometric ( @xmath9 ) luminosities .",
    "@xmath9 is roughly proportional to the area of the photosphere , hence @xmath5/@xmath9 is a good indicator of coronal x - ray activity per unit surface area .",
    "the @xmath5/@xmath9 value lies between 10@xmath1010@xmath11 , which is similar to low - mass pre - main - sequence stars ( e.g. , imanishi et al .",
    "2001 ) and dme stars @xcite , but is significantly higher than that of the quiescent solar corona ; @xmath25@xmath610@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that most of the upper limits of @xmath5/@xmath9 of x - ray non - detected bds and cbds are scattered around 10@xmath1010@xmath11 , which are comparable with or slightly lower than those of x - ray detected bds and cbds .",
    "this leads us to suspect that these x - ray non - detected bds and cbds may emit x - rays below but near at the current sensitivity limit of _ chandra_.    we also obtain the x - ray spectra from 1 bd and 3 cbds for the first time (  3.2 ) , which are fitted with a thin thermal plasma model of @xmath22 kev temperature .",
    "solar - like flares are also detected from 2 cbds ( gy 31 and gy 59 ,  3.3 ) .",
    "these x - ray features are similar to those of low - mass stars . together with the high @xmath5/@xmath9 value , we suggest that x - rays from bds and cbds are attributable to magnetic activities like low - mass stars .",
    "detection of highly variable radio emission from gy 31 , which probably arises from non - thermal gyro - synchrotron emission , also indicates the existence of strong and time variable magnetic activity ( p. andr , private communication ; see neuhuser et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "one debatable issue is the mechanism of magnetic field amplification .",
    "brown dwarfs are fully convective , hence the standard dynamo ( @xmath13-@xmath14 dynamo ) mechanism may not work .",
    "this situation is the same as low - mass protostars .",
    "as one possible scenario , @xcite proposed an amplification of the magnetic field between the star and the circumstellar disk by twisting through the differential rotation .",
    "if bds and cbds emit x - rays with the same mechanism , x - ray activity should vanish when the circumstellar disk disappears as the star evolves .",
    "figure [ fig : lx_rk ] shows the relation between the excess emission at @xmath39-band and the @xmath40 value .",
    "the excess emission is defined as @xmath41 = @xmath42/@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the flux from excess ( circumstellar ) emission and @xmath43 is the stellar flux at @xmath39-band @xcite , hence @xmath45 0 indicates the presence of the circumstellar disk .",
    "x - ray detected bds and cbds are uniformly distributed over two regions of @xmath46 0 and @xmath47 0 ; we see no hint that x - ray activity decreases as the circumstellar disk disappears ( @xmath47 0 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the existence of the disk is not the key parameter in x - ray emission of bds and cbds .",
    "another type of dynamo , such as turbulent - driven ( @xmath48 ) dynamo @xcite , is conceivable .",
