    "we start the process by assigning to @xmath96 an arbitrary vertex @xmath100 from @xmath21 and setting @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "( note that it is vacuously true that @xmath103 , a hypergraph consisting of one vertex and no edge , is a loose path . )",

    "if there exists a set @xmath105 of size @xmath106 such that @xmath107 , then we extend the path by adding the edge @xmath108 to the path ; vertices of @xmath109 are removed from @xmath97 .",

    ", we need to introduce the following useful family of trees .",
    "a tree @xmath157 is _ good _ if it consists of a path @xmath159 ( called the _ spine _ ) , some vertices ( called _ heavy _ ) that form a set @xmath160\\}$ ] that are connected to the spine by a perfect matching ( that is , for every @xmath161 , @xmath162 is adjacent to @xmath163 ) .",

    "now , we are ready to show that this family of trees is called good for a reason .",
    "[ lem : structure ] let @xmath157 be a good tree on @xmath17 vertices . then",

    "the strategy is divided into @xmath175 phases , each consisting of 3 rounds . on odd - numbered phases , swap active agents on all odd - indexed edges ; then , swap every active agent adjacent to a heavy vertex ( that is , agent occupying vertex @xmath163 for some @xmath161 ) with non - active agent ( occupying @xmath162 ) , and then repeat it again so that all active agents are back onto the spine . on even - numbered phases , swap agents on all even - indexed edges , followed by two rounds of swapping with non - active agents , as it was done before",
    "this has the following effect .",
    "agents that begin on odd - indexed vertices move `` forward '' in the vertex ordering , pause for one round at @xmath176 , move `` backward '' , pause again at @xmath177 , and repeat ; agents that begin on even - indexed vertices move backward , pause at @xmath177 , move forward , pause at @xmath176 , and repeat . since @xmath157 is good ,",
    "every non - active agent was initially adjacent to some vertex of the spine or some heavy vertex .",
    "hence , after @xmath175 phases , each active agent has traversed the entire spine taking detours to heavy vertices , if needed ; in doing so , she has necessarily passed by every other agent ( regardless whether active or non - active ) .",
    "it remains to show that agents can be rotated so that each agent is active at some point .",

    "we iteratively route a team onto the spine , call them active , apply the strategy described earlier for the active team , and repeat until all teams have traversed the spine .",

    "we treat teams of agents as _ super - vertices _ that form an ( abstract ) _ super - path _ of length @xmath300 . as in the proof of lemma  [ lem : structure ] , we use the strategy ensuring that within @xmath56 rounds every team of agents gets acquainted with every other agent and , moreover , that every agent visits every vertex of @xmath96 .",

    "[ rem : comment ] as we already mentioned , in the previous proof , the order in which teams are distributed for a given 1-factor was not important .",
    "one can fix an arbitrary order or , say , a random one that will turn out to be a convenient way of dealing with some small technical issue in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main3]b .",
    "it remains to prove the two theorems .",
    "as in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main1 ] , we use two - round exposure technique : @xmath69 can be viewed as the union of two independently generated random hypergraphs @xmath307 and @xmath308 , with @xmath309 and @xmath310 it follows from lemma  [ lem : alg ] that a.a.s .",

    "every vertex not on the path @xmath96 belongs to at least one edge of @xmath313 ( and thus @xmath19 , too ) that intersects with @xmath96 . indeed , for a given vertex @xmath100 not on the path @xmath96 , the number of @xmath23-tuples containing @xmath100 and at least one vertex from @xmath96 is equal to @xmath314 and so the probability that none of them occurs as an edge in @xmath313 is @xmath315 after taking @xmath316 close enough to 1 .",
    "the claim holds by the union bound .",
    "the rest of the proof is straightforward .",
    "we partition all agents into @xmath317 groups , @xmath318 , each consisting of at least @xmath319 agents .",

    "since each @xmath64-tuple of agents intersects at most @xmath64 groups , it must get acquainted eventually , and the proof is complete .",
    "first we assume that @xmath324 and @xmath106 divides @xmath135 . as usual , we consider two independently generated random hypergraphs @xmath307 and @xmath308 , with @xmath325 and @xmath326 .",
    "it follows from lemma  [ lem : hamilton ] that a.a.s .",
    "@xmath311 has a hamiltonian path @xmath327 .",
    "let @xmath222 be a large constant that will be determined soon .",

    "this can be made smaller than , say , @xmath333 , provided that @xmath222 is large enough .",
    "we will call agents occupying these vertices to be _ passive _ ; agents occupying sub - paths will be called _ active_. active agents will be partitioned into units , with respect to the sub - path they occupy .",
    "every unit performs ( independently and simultaneously ) the strategy from lemma  [ lem : ac_path ] on their own sub - path .",
    "after @xmath334 rounds , each @xmath64-tuple of agents from the same unit will be @xmath64-acquainted .",
    "now , we will show that a.a.s .",
    "every @xmath64-tuple of active agents , not all from the same unit , gets acquainted .",
    "let us focus on one such @xmath64-tuple , say @xmath109 .",
    "if one starts from a random order in the strategy from lemma  [ lem : ac_path ] ( see remark  [ rem : comment ] ) , then it is clear that with probability @xmath335 agents from @xmath109 visit at least @xmath336 different @xmath64-tuples of vertices .",
    "hence , by considering vertices that are not on paths agents from @xmath109 walk on , we get that with probability @xmath335 , the number of distinct @xmath23-tuples visited by agents from @xmath109 is at least @xmath337 considering only those edges in @xmath313 , the probability that agents from @xmath109 never got acquainted is at most @xmath338 for @xmath222 sufficiently large . since there are at most @xmath339 @xmath64-tuples of agents , a.a.s .",

    "each of the remaining @xmath304 vertices belong to at least one hyperedge intersecting with @xmath96 .",
    "we may treat these vertices as passive ones and proceed as before .",

    "if @xmath2 is connected , then @xmath346 .",
    "it is worth to mentioning that it was shown in  @xcite that for dense random graphs ( that is , graphs with average degree at least @xmath347 for @xmath348 ) the upper bound gives the right order of magnitude",
