    "as shown by @xmath0-body simulations , barred galaxies undergo considerable secular evolution ( e.g. hernquist & weinberg 1992 ; debattista & sellwood 2000 ; athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 [ am02 ] ; athanassoula 2002 [ a02 ] ; athanassoula 2003 [ a03 ] ; oneil & dubinski 2003 ; valenzuela & klypin 2003 ; martinez - valpuesta & shlosman 2004 ; athanassoula 2005a ; martinez - valpuesta , shlosman & heller 2005 ) .",
    "the halo plays a major role in this , since it participates in the angular momentum exchange within the galaxy . in an isolated disc galaxy with little or no gas , angular momentum",
    "is emitted mainly by near - resonant material in the inner disc ( bar region ) and absorbed by near - resonant material in the outer disc and in the halo ( a02 ; a03 ) . since the bar is a negative angular momentum feature ( kalnajs 1971 ; lynden - bell & kalnajs 1972 ) , by loosing angular momentum it will grow stronger ( a02 ) .",
    "-3pt    [ fig : phase ]    both for the disc and for the halo , there is more angular momentum gained ( or lost ) at a given resonance if the density is higher there and if the near - resonant material is colder .",
    "so , for equal amounts of mass , the outer disc will absorb more angular momentum than the halo , because it is colder .",
    "there is , however , considerably less mass in the outer disc than in the halo , so the role of the halo can be very important , or even predominant ( a03 ) .",
    "thus , bars immersed in massive responsive haloes can grow stronger than bars immersed in weaker haloes ( am02 ; a03 ) and very much stronger than bars immersed in rigid haloes ( a02 ) , since the latter can not , by their formation , absorb any angular momentum .",
    "since the halo plays such a crucial role in the evolution , it is reasonable to expect that its properties will evolve with time , as do the bar properties .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "here , i will particularly discuss the formation of an oval in the inner parts of the halo .",
    "figure  [ fig : halo - disc ] , from a simulation similar to those described in am02 or a03 , shows three orthogonal views of the disc ( upper panels ) and the halo ( lower panels ) from a simulation at a time well after the bar has formed , i.e. while it is secularly evolving .",
    "the disc is strongly barred , and seen side - on ( i.e. edge - on , with the line of sight along the bar minor axis ) it shows a strong peanut .",
    "the evolution of the halo , although less spectacular , is still quite clear .",
    "the inner parts have lost their initial spherical symmetry and show a clear prolate deformation , whose principal axes are roughly aligned with those of the disc bar .",
    "such a deformation is seen in all the simulations with a strong bar that i analysed and has also been discussed in athanassoula ( 2005b [ a05b ] ) and in colin , valenzuela & klypin ( 2005 ) .",
    "the axial ratio in the inner parts is roughly 0.7 and increases with radius .    analysing the halo mass distribution in spherical harmonics , it is possible to get more information on the halo bar .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : phase ] shows isocontours of the @xmath1=2 @xmath2=2 component , i.e. of the component that best characterises the halo bar . in the inner parts ,",
    "the phase of this component seems roughly the same as the phase of the disc bar ( dotted line in the figure ) .",
    "in fact , it trails it very slightly , of the order of a couple of degrees so that it is not easy to discern it on the plot .",
    "i found similar phase differences at other times and in other simulations i analysed .",
    "this phase difference increases substantially at larger radii , so that the outer parts of the @xmath1=2 @xmath2=2 component look spiral - like .",
    "as can be seen in the right panel of figure  [ fig : phase ] , the length of the halo bar increases substantially with time .",
    "athanassoula , ling and nezri ( 2005 ) studied the impact of halo shape and geometry on the expected wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) annihilation signal from the galactic center .",
    "they find that the asphericity has a strong impact on the annihilation signal when the halo density profile has a core near the center , such as advocated by observations ( bosma 2004 and references therein ) , but becomes less significant for cuspy profiles , such as advocated by simulations ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; moore _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; diemand _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) , and negligible in the presence of a central spike .",
    "as already mentioned in section  [ sec : role ] , the halo contains a fair fraction of near - resonant orbits .",
    "these are mainly trapped around lagrangian periodic orbits ( see fig 12 of a05b ) , or around x@xmath3-tree orbits are periodic orbits elongated along the bar and closing after one rotation and two radial oscillations ( contopoulos & grosb@xmath4l 1989 ) .",
    "the x@xmath3-tree is the 3d extension of the x@xmath3 family ( skokos , patsis & athanassoula 2002 ) and comprises , except for the x@xmath3 family , other 2d and 3d families bifurcating from x@xmath3 . ]",
    "periodic orbits ( fig 11 of a05b ) .",
    "halo particles which are near - resonant at a given time are not randomly chosen from the initial halo distribution function .",
    "particles at near - inner lindblad resonance had initially preferentially smaller cylindrical and spherical radii .",
    "they also had preferentially smaller values of @xmath5 , the @xmath6 component of the angular momentum .",
    "particles at near - corotation had preferentially initially intermediate cylindrical and spherical radii ( i.e. they were not located initially in the innermost or in the outermost regions ) .",
    "they had initially preferentially smaller values of @xmath7 , the @xmath6 velocity component , and larger values of @xmath5 than average .",
    "to summarise , we can say that the halo particles that will become near - resonant had initially properties similar to those of the disc particles .",
    "an important property for the evolution of the halo , and in general of the galaxy , is the fraction of chaotic orbits in its population . the most straightforward way of measuring this in simulations is to calculate the complexity of each orbit , as introduced by kandrup , eckstein & bradley ( 1997 ) .",
    "as shown by these authors , the complexity correlates well with the short term lyapounov exponents , often used to measure chaos .",
    "of course , the exact value of the fraction of chaotic orbits depends on where one sets the dividing line between a regular and a chaotic orbit .",
    "a05b calculated this fraction for different such threshold values and showed that it increases with the strength of the disc bar and that in a strongly barred galaxy as much as a quarter of the halo orbits can be chaotic .",
    "as shown both by periodic orbit calculations ( hasan & norman 1990 ; hasan , pfenniger & norman 1993 ) and by @xmath0-body simulations ( shen & sellwood 2004 and references therein ) a central mass concentration ( cmc ) affects the stability of x@xmath3 orbits , making them unstable and incapable of sustaining the bar .",
    "thus , provided the cmc is sufficiently massive and/or sufficiently centrally concentrated , it can destroy the bar , or at least considerably lower its amplitude .",
    "these simulations , however , use a rigid halo and thus are not fully - self - consistent .      seen the important role that the response of the halo can play on the evolution of barred galaxies , athanassoula , lambert & dehnen ( 2005 ) revisited this problem , now using a live halo , and i will here summarise some of their results .",
    "they find that the effect of the cmc depends drastically on the model .",
    "this is also illustrated in figure  [ fig : bhg_basic ] , which compares the effect of a given cmc on two different barred galaxy models .",
    "the difference is quite important . in the model on the left ( md - type , according to the definition of am02 )",
    "the cmc totally destroyed the bar .",
    "but in the model on the right ( mh - type ) the same cmc only decreased the bar strength , albeit substantially .",
    "in fact , the lowering of the bar strength is mainly due to a decrease of the bar length and to more axisymmetric innermost parts .",
    "the latter can be easily understood since this is the vicinity of the cmc .",
    "the cmc also causes an increase of the bar pattern speed in all cases .",
    "the difference between these two models could be due to the role of the halo in the two cases .",
    "indeed , in mh - type models the inner resonances in the halo are more populated , so that the halo can absorb more angular momentum , compared to md - type haloes ( a03 ) .",
    "this extra angular momentum is taken from the bar and will , as discussed in section  [ sec : role ] , tend to increase its strength .",
    "it will thus work against the cmc , whose effect will thus be lessened .",
    "this is indeed what the simulations of athanassoula et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show .",
