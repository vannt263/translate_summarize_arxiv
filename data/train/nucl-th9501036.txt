    "electromagnetic probes provide invaluable information about nuclear structure . the quasifree process",
    "@xmath1 has been used extensively to study proton hole states and to determine single particle spectroscopic factors @xcite .",
    "this reaction is advantageous because the electromagnetic interaction is known ; the relative weakness of the reaction permits the probe to interact almost uniformly through the entire nucleus , and the first order of perturbation theory should provide an adequate description of the process .",
    "coincidence measurements of the @xmath1 reaction can provide detailed information about the single particle structure of the nucleus over a wide range of momentum transfer .",
    "the @xmath1 reaction has been widely studied both non - relativistically @xcite and relativistically @xcite , and there are some discrepancies between the results of these investigations . both analyses begin with a lagrangian which allows for the interaction of the photon with both electrons and protons .",
    "non - relativistic analyses involve the reduction of the free electron - proton interaction to a form involving two - component spinors for the nucleon .",
    "this results in a hamiltonian which is expanded in powers of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the nucleon mass @xcite .",
    "the resulting interaction hamiltonian is sandwiched between schrdinger wave functions describing the nucleons in order to form the nuclear current .",
    "relativistic analyses are based on the feynman diagram for one - photon exchange between the projectile electron and a proton which is imbedded in the nucleus .",
    "the electrons and nucleons are all described relativistically as spin 1/2 objects via the dirac equation containing appropriate potentials @xcite .",
    "a long - standing problem in quasifree electron scattering has been that the spectroscopic factors extracted from non - relativistic analyses are smaller than expected from shell model calculations .",
    "spectroscopic factors which are found on the basis of the relativistic approach are generally larger than those found via the non - relativistic approach @xcite .",
    "several groups have attempted to understand the underlying differences between these two approaches .",
    "this mainly involved looking at the sensitivity of quasifree electron scattering calculations to different optical potentials and renormalizations of the continuum wave function @xcite .",
    "this concentration on optical potentials was largely a result of the improvement in the description of proton elastic scattering observables via dirac phenomenology over the standard non - relativistic optical model description .",
    "boffi et al .",
    "@xcite have multiplied the non - relativistic continuum wave function by a potential - dependent factor @xmath4 / \\left ( e + m \\right ) \\right\\}^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath5 is the dirac scalar potential and @xmath6 is the vector potential .",
    "this modification essentially changes the two - component schrdinger wave function into the upper component of the dirac wave function , while no other change is made in the non - relativistic calculation .",
    "they find that extracted occupation probabilities are larger than those obtained from the unmodified non - relativistic analysis .",
    "the analysis of udias et al .",
    "@xcite replaces the non - relativistic bound state wave function with the upper component of a dirac wave function , and the non - relativistic continuum wave function is modified by factors of the same shape as the factor used by boffi et al .",
    "the continuum wave function in this case is generated from schrdinger - equivalent potentials @xcite .",
    "the nuclear current operators are obtained in the standard way by expansion to order @xmath7 .",
    "their `` non - relativistic '' calculations then involve non - relativistic nuclear current operators surrounded by the upper components of dirac wave functions . with these choices little difference",
    "is found between the relativistic and `` non - relativistic '' calculations .",
    "their conclusion is that differences in observed cross sections are not due to non - relativistic reduction , but to the choice of optical potential .",
    "jin and onley @xcite have presented a model which can take either relativistic or non - relativistic optical potentials while keeping other aspects of the calculation the same .",
    "they find that different optical potentials can change the results by as much as 14% .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate the variability due to final state interactions , however , the issue is clouded by the occasional use of upper components of dirac wave functions in a non - relativistic calculation .",
    "we believe that the essential difference between relativistic and non - relativistic approaches are not just in the changes in the optical potentials ; these are usually phenomenological and equivalent potentials can always be found .",
    "rather the essential difference is in the appearance of the nuclear potentials in the nuclear current operators when the relativistic amplitude is reduced to a non - relativistic form .",
    "such medium effects on the nuclear currents are absent in the standard non - relativistic calculations .",
    "in this paper we study the differences between the relativistic and non - relativistic approaches in calculating the amplitude for the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "we do this through an effective pauli reduction of the relativistic transition amplitude @xcite .",
    "an expansion of the amplitude in powers of @xmath8 allows us to recover a non - relativistic limit , which matches the standard non - relativistic calculations , with the difference that optical potentials used to generate the distorted waves are exactly equivalent to those used in the relativistic calculations .",
    "the main difference , as mentioned above is that the nuclear currents are potential dependent .",
    "we compare the two approaches and thus explain why they can still give different values for the extracted spectroscopic factors , even when equivalent optical potentials are used .",
    "we introduce the relativistic amplitude for quasifree electron scattering in section [ rel - amp ] . section [ pauli ] outlines the pauli reduction of the amplitude and some of its relevant features are discussed in section [ e - results ] .",
    "the non - relativistic limit is discussed in section [ nonrel ] . in section [ n - results ]",
    "we compare our non - relativistic calculations with and without nuclear potentials in the nuclear current operators , to the results of the fully relativistic calculations .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ concl ] .",

    "proton polarization is shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) . in the region of large missing momentum there are large differences between the polarization calculated with and without nuclear potentials in the current operator .",
    "the polarization calculated with first and second order currents containing nuclear potentials yields results close in magnitude and shape to the results of the fully relativistic calculations .",
    "note in particular , that in the region of the minimum and maximum in the relativistic calculations close to @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively , the calculations without potentials included do not reproduce the shape of the relativistic calculations at all .",
    "the potentials must be included in the nuclear current operators in order to get close to the relativistic results . in particular a measurement of the proton polarization near @xmath79",
    "provides a clear opportunity to differentiate between relativistic and non - relativistic models .",
    "calculation of the asymmetry parameter of eq .",
    "( [ f15 ] ) , for small values of angular momentum @xmath81 of the bound nucleon (  @xmath82  ) , yields similar results for all the calculations whether fully relativistic ; or non - relativistic first or second order , with or without potentials in the nuclear current operator .",
    "when the angular momentum of the bound nucleon is increased , the differences between these calculations of the asymmetry become larger , as is evident in fig .",
    "the asymmetry is calculated for a @xmath9 target , with the residual state in @xmath83 assumed to be a @xmath84 proton hole .",
    "the incident electron has an energy of 461 mev , and the kinetic energy of the detected proton is fixed at 100 mev . in this case",
    "the differences are particularly apparent for missing momenta in the neighborhood of 20 mev / c .",
    "in order to clarify the differences arising from relativistic and non - relativistic descriptions of quasifree electron scattering @xcite , we have discussed an expansion of the s - matrix for the reaction @xmath1 in powers of @xmath8 through the effective pauli scheme .",
    "the resulting s - matrix depends on schrdinger - like wave functions for the bound and continuum nucleons , and nuclear current operators which contain the strong dirac potentials at the different orders .",
    "when the dirac potentials are included in the nuclear current operators , the series essentially converges to the fully relativistic results at second order for light- to medium - mass nuclei we have considered .",
    "this indicates the importance of the role played by the nuclear potentials in the modification of the currents .",
    "when the potentials are not included in the nuclear currents , the calculations can be far from the relativistic results particularly for larger missing momenta .",
    "these points were further studied in setting up a comparison between relativistic and non - relativistic calculations .",
    "a proper non - relativistic calculation is obtained through several steps : normalization of the bound schrdinger - like wave function to unity , proper normalization of the continuum schrdinger - like wave function , and in the nuclear current operators the energy of the nucleons is set equal to the nucleon mass ( i.e. take the limit @xmath76  ) .",
    "an additional step of removing the dirac potentials from the resulting nuclear current operators yields the standard non - relativistic amplitude .",
    "this results in a consistent and fair comparison between the relativistic and non - relativistic calculations .",
    "the potentials used for the bound and continuum protons yield both the relativistic and non - relativistic wave functions , with normalizations handled appropriately .",
    "the non - relativistic calculations we have shown for first and second order nuclear current operators without potentials give the same results that a standard non - relativistic calculation would give if provided with the schrdinger equivalent wave functions derived from the dirac equation .",
    "inclusion of the nuclear potentials in the non - relativistic nuclear current operator results in a large change in the calculated observables .",
    "in particular , calculations of the spectral function and final proton polarization using second order nuclear current operators which include the dirac potentials , can reproduce the magnitude and shape of the fully relativistic calculations .",
    "this is true even at large missing momenta where the non - relativistic calculations without potentials in the nuclear current operators yield very different results than the fully relativistic calculations .",
    "the polarization of the final proton is particularly sensitive to differences in the calculations , and measurements of this observable at large missing momenta could assist in the choice between the relativistic and non - relativistic approaches .",
    "we have also calculated the asymmetry defined in the text for the different orders , with and without potentials , and found that in cases in which the angular momentum of the bound nucleon is less than 2 , there are no noticeable differences between these calculations and the full relativistic .",
    "when the orbital angular momentum of the bound nucleon is greater than 2 differences between the resulting asymmetry in missing momentum of these calculations will appear .",
    "this observable thus will be useful in differentiating between relativistic and non - relativistic models only for nuclear states with large orbital angular momentum .",
    "other groups have examined the sensitivity of the models to changes in the optical potentials and modifications of the wave functions @xcite , and have found sensitivities at the level of 15% . however",
    ", the essential differences between the relativistic and non - relativistic approaches do not lie in modifications of the wave functions .",
    "the essential difference comes from the appearance of the nuclear potentials in the nuclear current operators ; a result of the reduction of the relativistic amplitude .",
    "we emphasize that _ these nuclear medium effects , characteristic of the present model , will not appear through a non - relativistic impulse description of the process_. they are , however , inherent in the relativistic description .",
    "we would like to thank j.m . udias and l. lapiks for useful correspondence regarding quasifree electron scattering .",
