    "spin foam models ( sfm)@xcite are an attempt at a covariant or path integral formulation of canonical loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite . in their current formulation ,",
    "sfm exploit the plebanski formulation @xcite of pure general relativity ( gr ) as a constrained bf theory .",
    "this approach is well motivated because one can view the plebanski action as a kind of perturbation of the bf action ( albeit the perturbation parameter is a lagrange multiplier field which one needs to integrate over in a path integral ) .",
    "the path integral for bf theory , however , is under good control @xcite so that one may hope to get a valid path integral formulation for gr by functional current derivation methods @xcite familiar from ordinary qft .    as we will try to explain in the next section",
    "( see also @xcite ) the quantum implementation of the so called simplicity constraints of plebanski theory , to the best knowledge of the authors , has still not been achieved to full satisfaction from first principles in sfm they are called simplicity constraints because they enforce the b field of bf theory to be simple , that is , to originate from a tetrad . clearly , unless the simplicity constraints are properly implemented , the resulting theory has little to do with quantum gravity .",
    "an issue to keep in mind is that the solutions to the classical simplicity constraint consist of five sectors , two of which give rise to @xmath0 times the palatini action , two of which give rise to @xmath0 times a topological action and a degenerate sector .",
    "all of these sectors are included in a sum over plebanski histories which may or may not be what one wants .",
    "it is appropriate to mention also further constraints in sfm at this point : namely , as we also explain in the next section , sfm rely on a simplicial triangulation @xmath1 of the differential 4-manifold as well as a dual graph @xmath2 .",
    "a recent analysis has shown @xcite that freely specifying geometrical data ( areas or fluxes ) on the faces of @xmath1 tends to lead to inconsistent values of the lengths of the edges of @xmath1 unless so called regge constraints in addition to the simplicity constraints are imposed .",
    "these constraints are important to be taken care of if one wants to relate sfm to the established theory of regge calculus @xcite and in order to capture the correct semiclassical limit .",
    "the underlying reason for these constraints is that regge calculus is formulated directly in terms of edge lengths while in sfm one rather works with electrical fluxes or areas .",
    "however , a typical simplicial triangulation has far more faces than edges in @xmath1 so that assigning a length to an edge from given area values maybe ambiguous and/or inconsistent .",
    "the authors of @xcite speculate that this may pose a problem also for canonical lqg and that the hamiltonian constraint of canonical lqg should maybe commute withe these regge constraints . in",
    "order avoid further confusion in the literature on this puzzling issue we will take here the opportunity to show that _ there are no regge like constraints in canonical lqg to be taken care of .",
    "_ notice that since our path integral is explicitly based on the holst action , there is no necessity to relate it to the regge action which for plebanski s theory is of course a challenge .",
    "one possibility to make progress on these issues is based on a very simple idea that , to the best knowledge of the authors , occurs for the first time in @xcite : namely , simply try to formulate the path integral in terms of the holst action @xcite rather than the plebanski action .",
    "not only is the holst action a valid starting point for canonical lqg , also the simplicity constraints are explicitly solved in that one works entirely with tetrads from the beginning .",
    "more precisely , the holst action uses a specific qudratic expression in the tetrads for the b field of bf theory which also depends on the immirzi parameter @xcite .",
    "hence , the holst action depends on a specific , non degenerate linear combination of the four non degenerate solutions of the simplicity constraints ( see next section for details ) and is thus at the same time more general and more restricted because the holst path integral will not sum over the afore mentioned five sectors of plebanski s theory .",
    "as already mentioned , it is at present debated how the fact that one actually takes a sum over all histories with a mixture of positive and negative palatini and topological actions affects the semiclassical properties of the plebanski path integral .    as observed in @xcite ,",
    "since the holst action is quadratic in the tetrads , one can in principle integrate out the tetrad in the resulting gaussian integral .",
    "this has been sketched in @xcite , however , the expressions given there are far from rigorous . here",
    "we will give a rigorous expression .",
    "also , we will include the correct measure factor @xcite resulting from the second class constraints involved in the holst action which makes sure that the path integral qualifies as a reduced phase space quantisation of the theory as has been stressed in @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis has been carried out for the plebanski theory in @xcite , however , the resulting measure factor is widely ignored in the sfm literature .",
    "the result of the gaussian integral is an interesting determinant that displays the full non linearity of einstein s theory .",
    "when translating the remaining integral over the connection in the partition function into sfm language , that is , sums over vertex , edge and face representations , one sees that our model differs drastically from all current sfm .    of course",
    ", we also need to introduce an ir and uv regulator in the form of a finite cell decomposition .",
    "two observations lead us to depart from the usual sfm approach where one works with simplicial cell complexes .",
    "the first is the result @xcite which demonstrates that current semiclassical states used in lqg do not assign good classical behaviour to the volume operator @xcite of lqg unless the underlying graph has cubic topology .",
    "since the volume operator plays a pivotal role for lqg as it defines triad operators and hence the dynamics , this is a first motivation to consider cubic triangulations of the four manifold , also called `` cubulations '' .",
    "notice that any four manifold can be cubulated and that within each chart of an atlas the cubulation can be chosen to be regular ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the second observation is that the original motivation for considering simplicial cell complexes in current sfm comes from their closeness to bf theory .",
    "bf theory is a topological qft and therefore one would like to keep triangulation independence of the bf sfm amplitude . that this is actually true",
    "is a celebrated result in bf theory . in particular , in order to keep triangulation independence it is necessary to integrate the b field over the triangles @xmath3 of the tringulation and the f field over the faces @xmath4 bounding the loops in a dual graph @xcite .",
    "however , gr is not a tqft and therefore the requirement to have triangulation independence is somewhat obscure .",
    "of course it is natural if one wants to exploit the properties of bf theory but not if one takes a different route as we tend to do here .",
    "hence , if we drop that requirement , then it is much more natural to refrain from considering the dual graph in addition to the triangulation .",
    "this also solves another issue : + notice that the gauge group @xmath5 acts on the b field of bf theory by the adjoint action and on the connection @xmath6 underlying @xmath7 in the usual way .",
    "the question is where the gauge transformation acts on the discretised variables @xmath8 ( flux and holonomy ) .",
    "it would be natural to have the gauge group act at the barycentres of @xmath3 and at the starting point of the loop @xmath9 which will be a vertex of the dual graph .",
    "however , notice that the vertices of the dual graph and the triangles are disjoint from each other , the edges of the graph are dual to the tetrahedra of the cell complex .",
    "hence , _ local _ gauge invariance in discretised bf theory at the level of the action is not manifest and even less in plebanski theory .",
    "in fact gauge invariance is related to the closure constraint in sfm which is a subtle issue as we will see in the next section .",
    "if one works just with a triangulation and drops the dual graph then gauge invariance issues are easy to take care of .",
    "hence , it is motivated to work with a triangulation that maximally simplifies the gaussian integral .",
    "as we will show , this again leads to cubulations .",
    "this also nicely fits with the framework of algebraic quantum gravity @xcite which in its minimal version also is formulated in terms of algebraic graphs of cubic topology only .",
    "+   + the architecture of this article is as follows : + in section two we give a non technical review of current spin foam models .",
    "we sketch their derivation from the classical plebanski action focussing on the points where a first principle argument is missing .",
    "these issues will be the motivation for our different route .    in section three",
    "we clarify the issue mentioned above , namely whether the regge constraints on sfm discovered recently in @xcite also arise in the canonical formulation .",
    "we prove that they do not play any role in lqg .    in section four",
    "we derive the holst sfm using cubulations as uv regulator as motivated above .",
    "as this is a exploratory paper only , we will not worry about convergence issues which will be properly addressed in subsequent works .",
    "more precisely , what we compute are tetrad n - point functions .",
    "these should contain sufficient information to compute anything of interest in lqg such as graviton scattering amplitudes as in @xcite via lsz ( lehmann  zimmermann  symanzik ) like formulas as in ordinary qft @xcite which allows to reconstruct the s ",
    "matrix from symmetric vacuum n  point functions . of course",
    ", how these n - point functions are related to true observables in a diffeomorphism invariant theory is a subtle issue which will be clarified in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "here we only give a summary .",
    "the n - point functions can be computed in closed form up to a remaining functional integral over the connections .",
    "this can be done for either signature of the spacetime metric . at this point",
    "one could invoke sfm techniques and expand the integral using harmonic analysis on the gauge group .",
    "the resulting intertwiner displays a much more complictated structure than in any of the current spin foam models .",
    "in particular , pictorially speaking one basic building block is an _ octagon diagramme _ an analytic expression for which could be called the _ 96  j symbol _ in the case of @xmath10 .",
    "yet , the n - point functions display a certain wick like structure as if they came from a gaussian integral .",
    "what makes the theory interacting and obstructs the tetrads from being a generalised free field is the additional functional integral over the connection . in background",
    "dependent qft the moments of a gaussian measure depend on a background dependent covariance ( usually depending on the laplacian ( in the euclidean setting ) and the mass ) .",
    "our theory behaves similar , just that due to background independence the covariance is itsef a field that must be integrated over .",
    "this is similar in spirit to what happens in 3d @xcite when coupling gr to point particles : there , when integrating over the gravitational degrees of freedom one ends up with particles moving on a non commutative geometry . here instead of a non commutative geometry we obtain an interacting theory of tetrad fields .    in section five",
    "we conclude and outline the missing tasks that need to be performed before our model can be taken seriously .",
    "an interesting result of our analysis is that in the present formulation which lacks the simplicity constraints of plebansk s theory , the irreducible representations of @xmath11 are not forced to be simple .",
    "simple representations , which basically reduce @xmath11 to an @xmath12 subgroup , can only arise if we impose the time gauge which in the classical theory is used in order to reduce the holst connection to the ashtekar ",
    "immirz connection which is a necessary ingredient in the canonical quantisation programme .",
    "gauge fixing conditions of course naturally arise in any attempt to make formal path integral expressions better behaved and here the situation is similar .",
    "two appendices treat some simple technical aspects of this work .",
    "most parts of this paper do not depend on whether the spacetime signature is lorentzian or euclidean .",
    "in this section we intend to give a brief summary of the developments in sfm theory with a focus on the derivation of the current models from the plebanski action and the gaps in that derivation .",
    "this serves as the motivation for the present paper .",
    "+   + to begin with , it is worth mentioning that the classical solutions to the simplicity constraints actually comprise altogether five sectors , namely two topological sectors @xmath13 , two palatini sectors @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 denotes the hodge map with respect to the internal minkowski or euclidean metric ) and one degenerate sector . in a path integral",
    "a sum over all these sectors will occur while one would expect that one should only include one of the palatini sectors or maybe a holst sector @xmath16 @xcite in order to have a path integral for einstein s theory . here",
    "@xmath17 is the immirzi parameter of lqg @xcite .",
    "we now sketch the usual `` derivation '' of sfm from the plebanski action : + the plebanski action is of the form [ 2.1 ] s= tr(bf(a)+bb ) where @xmath18 is a scalar lagrange multiplier field with values in the tensor product of two copies of @xmath19 or @xmath20 depending on the signature and @xmath7 is the curvature of the connection @xmath6 . in a formal path integral",
    "formulation one integrates @xmath21 over @xmath22 . integrating first over @xmath18 we are left with a partition function of the form [ 2.2 ] z=(c(b))(itr(bf ) ) where @xmath23 denotes the collection of the simplicity constraints on @xmath24 .",
    "if one would solve the delta distribution by integration over @xmath24 one would get the afore mentioned sum over the five sectors and integral over the tetrad fields .",
    "however , this would result in a complicated expression which does not exploit the relation of plebanski s formulation to bf theory .",
    "thus , rather than doing that , one notices that roughly speaking [ 2.3 ] b ( itr(bf))= ( itr(bf ) ) denoting the functional derivative by @xmath25 one can now formally pull the @xmath26 distribution out of the @xmath24 integral and perform the integration over @xmath24 resulting in [ 2.4 ] z=(c(x))(f ) without the `` operator '' @xmath27 this would be the formal partition function of bf theory .",
    "thus , one has achieved the goal to preserve the closeness of the theory to bf theory .",
    "one now should expand @xmath28 in terms of eigenfunctions of the collection of operators @xmath29 and keep only the zero eigenfunctions multiplied by @xmath30 .    in order to give meaning to those formal expressions",
    "one has to introduce a uv and ir cutoff as is customary in constructive qft .",
    "that is , one considers finite simplicial triangulations @xmath1 of the ( possibly compact ) differential 4 manifold and dual graphs @xmath2 .",
    "the two forms @xmath24 are now approximated by integrals @xmath31 of @xmath24 over triangles @xmath3 of @xmath1 while the curvatures @xmath7 are approximated by holonomies @xmath32 around the loops @xmath9 of the faces @xmath4 dual to the triangles @xmath3 .",
    "one writes @xmath33 for the face dual to @xmath3 .",
    "the bf action is then discretised by [ 2.5 ] _",
    "ttr(a(f(t))b(t ) ) the reason to work with both @xmath1 and @xmath2 is that in fact [ 2.6 ] _",
    "m tr(bf)=_t tr(f(f(t ) ) b(t ) ) is _ an exact identity _",
    "@xcite where @xmath34 denotes the integral of @xmath7 over @xmath4 .",
    "this is very convenient in particular for pure bf theory .",
    "the only approximation thus consists in replacing @xmath34 by @xmath35 .",
    "likewise , the functional derivatives @xmath25 must be approximated by ordinary derivatives @xmath36 with respect to the variables @xmath37 .",
    "notice that when defined like that , the @xmath36 are mutually commuting .",
    "the exploration of the model with this definition of @xmath36 will appear in @xcite . however , this is not what is done in current sfm .",
    "rather one replaces @xmath36 by @xmath38 , the right invariant vector field on the copy of @xmath39 associated with the variable @xmath40 .",
    "the reason for doing that is that the @xmath38 have a simpler action on the delta distribution [ 2.7 ] ( f):=_t _ g(a(f(t ) ) it is usually justified by saying that @xmath28 has support on @xmath41 and that @xmath42 differ by multiplication with holonomies which should be supported at @xmath43 .",
    "however , this argument is certainly not rigorous because the support of the @xmath26 distribution can drastically change when acting with differential operators .",
    "moreover , as already said , this substitution comes with a price : while the simplicity constraints in terms of @xmath36 are mutually commuting , those in terms of @xmath38 are not , in fact they are inconsistent with each other .",
    "in addition , one does not impose all the simplicity constraints but only a subset of them : there are three types : constraints involving 1 . the same triangle , 2 .",
    "two triangles sharing an edge and 3 .",
    "two triangles sharing a vertex .",
    "the latter constraint is implied by the so called closure constraint on tetrahedra @xmath44 [ 2.8 ] _",
    "tt y_t=0 ( but not vice versa ) .",
    "this constraint looks as if it would be automatically satisfied because it looks like a gauge invariance condition .",
    "however , the product of @xmath26 distributions ( [ 2.7 ] ) in @xmath45 is not annihilated by the closure constraint ( [ 2.8 ] ) !",
    "this is obvious from the fact that the product of @xmath26 distributions involves products of the form [ 2.9 ] _ tt _ _",
    "t(a(f(t ) ) where @xmath46 denotes an irreducuible representation of @xmath39 and @xmath47 its character .",
    "however , there is no gauge invariant interwiner among the loops @xmath48 .",
    "one usually argues that the closure constraint is taken into account because _ after _ integrating over @xmath6 one",
    "is only left with gauge invariant intertwiners , but this is wrong _ before _ integrating .",
    "in fact since integration with the haar measure always projects out the gauge invariant part , anything can be made gauge invariant this way .",
    "we feel that neglecting the 3rd kind of simplicity constrant ( implied by taking the closure constraint for granted ) makes the model too local .",
    "the effect of truly taking the closure constraint into account will also be explored in @xcite .",
    "as already said , even the simplicity constraints of the first two types are anomalous as they imply vanishing volume @xcite and fix the above mentioned intertwiner to be unique ( the model has not enough degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this and other investigations has ruled out the barrett ",
    "crane model @xcite which however was an important step in sfm research because it triggered the development of model independent mathematical tools .",
    "recent activities in sfm therefore have focussed on trying to implement the simplicity constraints of the first two types differently .",
    "there are two camps : in @xcite one uses master constraint type of techniques which were developed in a different context @xcite in order to treat anomalous ( rather : second class ) constraints . in @xcite one refrains from imposing the simplicity constraints as operator conditions altogether but rather imposes them semiclassically by expanding sfm amplitudes in terms of group coherent states @xcite developed by perelomov @xcite and then uses the simplicity condition on the classical bivectors on which the semiclassical amplitudes depend .    in our view",
    ", while these methods seem to give rise to models with better semiclassical properties @xcite and to a better understanding whether one is looking at the topological or palatini sector respectively , in our opinion it is fair to say that a satisfactory derivation from first principles is missing . by this",
    "we mean that one should be able to arrive at those models starting from the plebanski action , another classically equivalent action or the hamiltonian formulation and then carry out integrations and imposition of constraints without intermediate approximations or ad hoc substitutions as those listed above .",
    "this is precisly the motivation of the current paper .",
    "in canonical lqg the states are not labelled by a pair consisting of a graph and a dual polyhedronal complex ( in fact , generic graphs do not admit such a dual complex at all ) .",
    "rather states are just labelled by graphs , edge representations and vertex intertwiners .",
    "this is the spin network orthonormal basis .",
    "in fact , all graphs are used in canonical lqg , not only four valent ones as the ones that are used in present sfm analysis based on simplicial trangulations which is why current sfm only capture a small subspace of the lqg hilbert space .",
    "this subspace is not left invariant under the lqg holonomy flux algebra @xcite so that this subspace is not a representation of it .",
    "hence , in order to establish the relation between lqg and sfm it would seem that one needs to include spin network states on all possible boundary graphs into the sfm analysis .",
    "in addition to this basis of states , one has holonomy , flux , area , triad or length operators labelled by curves or surfaces .",
    "none of them has a physical meaning , it is only their occurence in compound operators assembeled from them and which are dirac observables or constraint operators respectively which has a physical meaning .",
    "these arise as integrals over spatial scalar densities and by the theorem established in paper v of the series @xcite any dependence of these quantities on the electric degrees of freedom is via triad like operators .",
    "more in detail , the cylindrical projections of such operators are labelled by arbitrary graphs and the triad like operators as well as the holonomies that arise in the corresponding expressions are defined by the edges of that graph .",
    "hence we see that also physically relevant operators just depend on the structure of a graph and not on a dual cell complex .",
    "this is maybe confusing because flux and operators depending on arbitrary ( piecewise analytic ) surfaces and curves actually define the fundamental kinematical algebra underlying lqg .",
    "however , flux operators are used at intermediate stages , they are not even gauss invariant .",
    "what one uses are volume operators and constructs from them length operators @xcite and more generally triad like operators via the techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "these triad operators which enter gauge invariant and diffeomorphism co(in)variant expressions such as the hamiltonian constraint only excite the states along the edges of its underlying graphs .",
    "again , there is no reference to any polyhedronal cell complex whatsoever .",
    "there are efforts to invent a length operator which also uses a cell complex @xcite , however , the resulting operator in contrast to @xcite is not cylindrically consistent .    now",
    "although they do not have a direct physical meaning , lqg admits these holonomy and flux or area operators labelled by arbitrary curves and surfaces respectively not related to any graph @xcite . a given collection of such operators may or may not have good semiclassical properties with respect to a given semiclassical state .",
    "but this is always true in quantum theory : even the standard coherent states of the harmonic oscillator do not assign good semiclassical expectation values to all operators that one can construct in the corresponding hilbert space , see e.g. @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "what is important is that there is a sufficient number of functions on phase space that should seperate the points . in our case",
    "these could be holonomies and triads integrated along the edges of the graph underlying the given semiclassical state .",
    "these variables are enough to separate the points of the classical phase space to an arbitrary precision depending on how fine the given graph is embedded with respect to the background metric to be approximated .",
    "now it is true that there are certain semiclassical states in lqg that depends on a polyhedronal 3d complex @xmath1 @xcite as an additional structure .",
    "however , this 3d @xmath1 does not have any dynamical interpretation as in sfm since it does not define a 4d extension .",
    "it just serves to construct a complexifier @xcite and thus to produce an infinite family of states labelled by @xmath1 , a fixed point @xmath49 in the classical phase space and any graph @xmath17 . any sufficiently fine @xmath1 would do and so @xmath1 does not have any fundamental meaning .",
    "in fact one could choose to consider complexifiers that do not come from any @xmath1 , see e.g. the first reference of @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical properties are optimal for those members of the family for which @xmath17 is in fact dual to @xmath1 . for each edge @xmath50 of such a graph",
    "there is a classical flux value @xmath51 and a classical holonomy @xmath52 which label the state where @xmath53 is the unique face in @xmath1 dual to @xmath50 . _",
    "notice that what one is interested in are the lengths of the edges @xmath50 in @xmath17 and not the length of the links in the 1-skeleton of @xmath1_. due to duality , there is a one to one correspondence between the classical values @xmath51 and the expectation values of the length operators associated to @xmath50 , no overcounting of degrees of freedom takes place , no ambiguities arise , whatever @xmath1 is .    that the corresponding length operators assume the correct semiclassical expectation value with respect to these states follows from the analysis performed in @xcite where one has chosen cubical @xmath1 for simplicity .",
    "in fact , the analysis of @xcite has demonstrated that the volume operator of lqg assumes the correct semiclassical expectation values only if @xmath1 has cubical topology so that one does not really have too much of a choice as far as @xmath1 is concerned .",
    "this in turn implies that current spin foam models based on simplicial cell complexes do not admit the semiclassical states @xcite as boundary states which could mean that the current models maybe have to be extended to more general triangulations .",
    "notice that curiously , in 3d , in contrast to simplicial cell complexes , the number of faces of ( sufficiently regular ) cubical @xmath1 equals the number of links in the 1-skeleton of @xmath1 so that also here there is a one to one correspondence between faces and links _ within @xmath1_. however , this does not have any relevance for our main point , namely that in lqg the fundamental quantum objects are holonomies along the edges of graphs and triad or length operators associated to those edges , there is no association of length or area operators to links or faces in some dual cell complex .    to summarise : + in lqg there is a basis of states labelled by graphs .",
    "given an arbitrarily small error , there is a set of operators whose classical counterparts separate the points of the classical phase space up to that error and whose cylindrical projections are labelled by the edges of graphs . in addition , there are also semiclassical states depending on graphs with respect to which this separating system of operators have optimal semiclassical properties .",
    "there is no triangulation with respect to which one would be interested in relating the lengths of the edges of its 1  skeleton to the areas of its surfaces .",
    "regge like constraints never occur .",
    "this is the main section of the present paper .",
    "it is subdivided into five parts . in the first we motivate the use of cubulations from different perspectives and",
    "discuss some of their properties . in the second we sketch the relation between path integral n - point functions and physical ( observable ) correlators in terms of the physical inner product of the theory .",
    "more details on that issue will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this crucially works via a choice of gauge fixing or clock system . in the third part",
    "we apply our machinery to n - point tetrad functions or equivalently to a generating function of a ( complex , regulated ) measure .",
    "that measure displays a gaussian like structure and we can accordingly integrate out half of the degrees of freedom under some assumptions about the choice of gauge fixing . in the fourth part",
    "we discuss the properties of the resulting integral over the remaining degrees of freedom , its wick like structure and the structure of the vertex amplitude of the corresponding sfm model when invoking harmonic analysis on the gauge group .",
    "finally , in the fifth part we discuss how these n - point functions are related to the physical inner product and the kinematical hilbert space of lqg , in particular , how the covariant connection of the holst path integral reduces to the ashtekar  barbero ",
    "immirzi connection of the canonical theory in physical amplitudes .",
    "we start by motivating the use of cubulations rather than simplicial triangulations .",
    "let us look more closely at the issue of gauge invariance for bf theory which makes use also of a dual graph . here",
    "gauge invariance is not preserved locally ( i.e. triangle wise ) in the formula @xmath54 if both @xmath24 and @xmath7 transform locally in the adjoint representation . in order to make the gauge transformations more local",
    ", one could discretise them . to see how this can be achieved , recall that by definition of a cell dual to a simplex$ ] where the points @xmath55 denote its corners . ] in a simplicial complex @xmath1 , the face @xmath33 is a union of triangles @xmath56 $ ] subject to the condition @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 denotes the barycentre @xcite of a simplex and @xmath59 denote tetrahedra and four simplicies in @xmath1 respectively .",
    "so we see that both @xmath3 and @xmath33 contain the barycentre @xmath60 in their intersection and we could _ define _ a disjoint action of the gauge group on both @xmath61 at @xmath60 . however , this is no longer possible when using the approximation @xmath62 because now the only natural action of the gauge group on the loop holonomy is by adjoint action at a starting point on @xmath63 .",
    "now @xmath63 is a composition of the half edges @xmath64 $ ] where @xmath65 but the fundamental degrees of freedom are the holonomies along the edges @xmath66 $ ] for @xmath67 . obviously , the only natural starting point of the loops is then at the vertices @xmath68 which are disjoint from the triangles @xmath3 .",
    "but the triangles are also disjoint from the half edges as a simple calculation reveals .",
    "hence , in order to maintain gauge invariance one has to invent an unnatural discretised action of the gauge group .",
    "we do not know if such a consistent prescription can be found at all but rather take these complications that come from the fact that one is dealing simultaneously with a ( simplicial ) complex and its dual cell complex as a further piece of motivation to work just with the triangulation .",
    "the previous considerations do not specify the type of triangulations to be considered . as already said ,",

    "we must have either @xmath230 or @xmath231 .    for our illustrative purposes",
    "let us consider for simplicity that @xmath39 is compact , the non compact case has the same sfm vertex structure but the harmonic analysis is a bit more complicated .",

    "it follows that the end result of the integration is that for each edge @xmath222 there is a gauge invariant intertwiner [ 5.44 ] _ \\{^v_,^v-_}_= : = [ _ g d_h(g ) [ _ = ^v_(g ) ^v-_(g ) ] which intertwines _ six _ representations rather than four as in ( constrained ) bf theory on simplicial triangulations .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is of course that we are using cubulations rather than simplicial triangulations .",
    "these six representations involved for edge @xmath115 correspond precisely to the six plaquette loops @xmath244 of which @xmath115 is a segment .",
    "therefore , if we associate to each face @xmath245 an irreducible representation @xmath246 and denote by @xmath247 the collection of all the @xmath248 then the basic building block ( [ 5.44 ] ) can be written in the more compact form [ 5.45 ] _",

    "moreover , the intertwiner ( [ 5.45 ] ) is the direct analog of the intertwiner in bf theory which there defines the pentagon diagramme @xcite . if we would try to draw a corresponding picture for our model then for each vertex @xmath112 we would draw eight points , one for each each edge @xmath76 incident at @xmath112 .",
    "these edges are labelled by the intertwiner @xmath250 . given two points corresponding to edges @xmath251 consider the unique face @xmath4 that has @xmath251 in its boundary .",
    "draw a line between each such points and label it by @xmath248 .",

    "the face spanned by @xmath254 is @xmath255 , the face spanned by @xmath256 is @xmath257 , the face spanned by @xmath258 is @xmath259 and finally the face spanned by @xmath260 is @xmath261 .",
    "the corresponding label on the lines is thus @xmath262 respectively .",
    "thus the octagon diagramme has eight points and 6 x 4 = 24 lines ( each line connects two points ) .",
    "these correspond to the 24 plaquettes that have a corner in @xmath112 namely for each @xmath226 these are @xmath263 . in the case of @xmath10",
    "each irreducible representation is labelled by two spin quantum numbers .",
    "the intertwiner freedom is labelled by three irreducible representations of of @xmath232 and there is one irreducible representation corresponding to a face .",
    "thus the octagon diagramme depends on 3 x 8 + 24=48 irreps of @xmath232 or 96 spin quantum numbers . since each intertwiner ( [ 5.45 ] ) factorises into _ two _ intertwiners @xcite ( one for the starting point and one for the beginning point of the edge but both depending on the same representations ) we may actually collect those eight intertwiners associated to the same vertex .",
    "the collection of those eight factors is actually the analytic expression corresponding to the octagon diagramme which therefore maybe called the _ 96 j ",
    "symbol_.    .",
    "the eight corners correspond to the eight edges @xmath264 adjacent to @xmath112 .",
    "the line between corners labelled by @xmath265 for @xmath253 corresponds to the face @xmath266 .",
    "we should colour corners by intertwiners @xmath250 and lines by representations @xmath248 but refrain from doing so in order not to clutter the diagramme . altogether",
    "48 irreducible representations of @xmath267 ( or 96 of @xmath12 ) are involved . ]",
    "the decisive difference between ( constrained ) bf theory and our model is however that in ( constrained ) bf theory the analog of the function @xmath219 is a product of @xmath26 distributions , one for each face holonomy .",
    "the simplicity constraints just impose restrictions on the representations and intertwiners , but this can not change the fact that there is factorisation in the face dependence . in our model ,",
    "the face dependence does not factorise , hence , in this sense it is less local or more interacting .",
    "another striking feature of our model is the following : constrained bf theory , that is , plebanski theory , should be a candidate for quantum gravity .",
    "our holst model should be equivalent to that theory at least semiclassically because morally speaking , the only difference between them lies in the technical implementation of the simplicity constraints , modulo the caveats mentioned in section [ s2 ] .",
    "now one of the most important property of the implementation of the simplicity constraints in usual sfm is that the irreducible spin(4 ) representations that one sums over are the simple ones then a simple irrep .",
    "is one for which @xmath268 @xcite .",
    "there is a similar restriction if one works with arbitrary immirzi parameter @xcite . ] . in our model",
    "we do not see any sign of that .",
    "this is an important issue because the restriction to simple representations means that the underlying gauge theory is roughly su(2 ) rather than spin(4 ) which looks correct if the sfm is to arise from canonical lqg which indeed is a su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "thus , in usual sfm the simplicity constraints seem to already imply the gauge fixing of the `` boost '' part of the spin(4 ) gauss constraint that is necessary at the classical level in order to pass from the holst connection to the ashtekar  barbero ",
    "immirzi connection @xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "that has not been established yet as pointed out in @xcite where it is shown that the connection used in sfm is actually the spin connection and not the holst connection .",
    "but apart from that , in the considerations of the previous section we do not see any simplicity restrictions on the type of group representations .",
    "however , notice that what we did in the previous section was incomplete because in order to properly define the n  point functions we must gauge fix the generating functional with respect to the g gauss constraints .",
    "formally this is not necessary if we only consider correlators of g invariant functions such as the metric because the infinite gauge group volume formally cancels out in the fraction @xmath269/z[0]$ ] .",
    "however , details matter : + the formal arguments can not be substantiated by hard proofs in this case .",
    "specifically , if we consider @xmath73 , there is no measure known for gauge theories for non compact groups ( see @xcite for the occurring complications ) and thus we are forced to gauge fix at least the boost part of the gauss constraint .",
    "this is the same reason for which one uses the time gauge in the canonical theory .",
    "we expect that implementing the time gauge fixing @xcite in a way similar to the implementation of the simplicity constraints in usual bf theory will effectively reduce the gauge group to @xmath12 .",
    "details will appear elsewhere , but roughly speaking the idea is the following : + the time gauge is a set of constraints @xmath270 $ ] on the co ",
    "tetrad @xmath50 . by the usual manipulations we can pull the corresponding @xmath26 distribution out of the cotetrad fuctional integral and formally obtain [ 5.47 ]",
    "[ _ holst[j ] where @xmath271 is the generating functional of the previous section and @xmath272 stands for the ashtekar  barbero ",
    "immirzi path integral .",
    "whether this really works in a rigorous fashion remains to be seen .",
    "however , we find it puzzling that the simplicity constraints in usual sfm , which classically have nothing to do with the time gauge , should automatically yield the correct boundary hilbert space .",
    "it seems intuitively clear that the time gauge must be imposed in the quantum theory in addition to the simplicity constraints , just like in the classical theory , as we suggest . without imposing it ,",
    "we do not see any sign of a restriction from @xmath39 to @xmath12 in our model where we solve the simplicity constraints differently .",
    "we expect this to be related to the work @xcite .",
    "this observation indicates that usual sfm and our formulation are rather different from each other .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a different strategy to construct spin foam models for gr . rather than the plebanski action we take the holst action as our starting point .",
    "this means that the simplicity constraints of the plebanski formulation have been correctly taken care of .",
    "the price to pay is that the connection to bf theory is lost .",
    "the motivation behind our strategy is that bf theory is a tqft and therefore quite different from gr which has an infinite number of physical degrees of freedom .",
    "hence the usual triangulation independent methods developed for tqft and employed in current sfm are possibly less powerful in the context of gr .",
    "in particular , the fact that it is difficult to deal with the simplicity constraints in current sfm might be a sign of that .",
    "another problem with the plebanski formulation that we have not mentioned yet is that it is difficult to couple matter because matter directly couples to the cotetrad rather than the b field . in principle",
    "one can express e via b modulo simplicity constraints but the corresponding formulas are even more involved than those for e. notice that one _ must _ couple matter to bf theory in order to get a realistic model . for 3d gravity coupling matter is straightforward @xcite because there b field and e coincide while in 4d this has not been done yet except for non standard model fermions which just couple to the connection @xcite or membranes coupled to pure bf theory @xcite .",
    "the method we proposed in this paper might be a called a brute force and textbook strategy . dropping the insistance on triangulation independence right from the beginning we proposed a wilson action like naive discretisation of the holst action .",
    "we carefully studied the connection of the holst path integral with the canonical lqg correlation or n  point functions and used relational techniques to make the connection with the physical hilbert space and observables . in principle , none of these ingredients are new , they have been successfully employed in other contexts .",
    "of course , the appealing elegance of ( constrained ) bf theory has disappeared in our formulation , the integrals to be computed are rather challenging ( but not impossible ) and the gauge fixing conditions for spatial diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraint as well as a local measure factor without which the connection to observation is lost complicate the formalism . yet",
    ", we feel that the resulting structure , while far from being worked out in detail , has some interesting features such as the wick like structure of the physical tetrad correlators and a less local structure .",
    "in particular , we have shown that imposing the time gauge also in the quantum theory comes out as a necessary and natural condition in our model in order to make contact with the lqg hilbert space .    as already mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "this paper is exploratory in nature .",
    "it focuses more on ideas rather than analysis and there are many open issues that need to be settled before the present model can be taken seriously .",
    "apart from the topological issues mentioned in section [ s5.1 ] , the convergence and measure theoretic issues discussed in section [ s5.3 ] and finally the issues with the imposition of the time gauge outlined in section [ s5.5 ] there are further points that need to be addressed .",
    "one of the most serious ones is the continuum limit : the fact that we are working with cubulations suggests a naive but natural notion of continuum limit which consists in studying the behaviour of the correlation functions under barycentric refinement of the hypercubes at fixed ir regulator ( boundary surface ) . of course , in the spirit of the aqg framework @xcite one could also say that the continuum limit has been taken already provided that one works with infinite cubulations .",
    "this requires then , in a seperate step , to remove the ir regulator .",
    "a more practical but still important problem is the following : even at finite uv and ir regulator , it is already hard enough to compute the determinant of the covariance matrix of the co - tetrad gaussian and to determine its index ( which may vanish automatically , see appendix [ sb ] ) .",
    "but since these covariances are highly correlated , the practical computation of the n  point functions at least in the macroscopic regime will be possible only if the corresponding non trivial measure has some kind of cluster property @xcite .",
    "we hope to come back to all of these issues and many more in several future publications .",
