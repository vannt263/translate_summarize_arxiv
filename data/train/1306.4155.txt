    "the resonance transmission energies for a pair of particles in s states are lower than that for a pair of those in a states .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the vicinity of the collision point , the wave function is zero .    when @xmath141 there are six similar wells , three of them at each side of the plane @xmath189 . the symmetry with respect to the plane @xmath189 explains the presence of doublets",
    "the presence of states with definite symmetry is associated with the fact that the axis @xmath61 is a third - order symmetry axis . however , in contrast to the case @xmath103 , one can obtain either s or a combinations of states .",
    "for example , the first four solutions of the problem , in one of the wells ( e.g. , the one restricted with the pair - collision planes `` 13 '' and `` 23 '' ) possess the dominant components @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 .",
    "note that the first , second , and fourth of these functions are symmetric with respect to the permutation @xmath194 , while the third one is antisymmetric .",
    "hence , in all six wells using the first four solutions one can obtain six s and two a states .    when @xmath195 there are 14 wells .",

    "the corresponding eigenenergy is denoted @xmath124 . for these states",
    ", doublets must be observed , similar to the case of three particles .",
    "however , the separation between the energy levels is much smaller , because the 4-well groups are strongly separated by two barriers , instead of only one barrier in the case @xmath141 .",
    "the necessary condition for the quasi - stationary state being symmetric ( antisymmetric ) is that the wave functions must be symmetric ( antisymmetric ) with respect to those coordinates @xmath196 and @xmath197 , for which @xmath198 .",
    "the effect of quantum transparency is caused by the existence of barrier quasistationary states imbedded in the continuum .",
    "[ max ] shows that in the case of resonance transmission , the wave functions depending on the center - of - mass variable @xmath61 are localized in the vicinity of the potential barrier center ( @xmath189 ) .    for the energy values corresponding to some of the transmission coefficient peaks in fig .",
    "[ nt11 ] at @xmath199 within the effective range of barrier potential action , the wave functions demonstrate considerable increase ( from two to ten times ) of the probability density in comparison with the incident unit flux .",

    ", the wave functions are localized at the barrier side , on which the wave is incident , and decrease to zero within the effective range of the barrier action .",
    "note that the explicit explanation of the quantum transparency effect is achieved in the framework of kantorovich close - coupling equations because of the multi - barrier potential structure of the effective potential , appearing explicitly even in the diagonal or adiabatic approximation , in particular , in the s case for @xmath103 @xcite . nevertheless , in galerkin close - coupling equations",

    "one can see that the diagonal approximation of the kantorovich method provides better approximations of the positions of the transmission coefficient @xmath200 resonance peaks . with the increasing number of basis functions , i.e. , the number @xmath202 of close - coupling equations with respect to the center - of - mass coordinates in galerkin ( [ mo3e ] ) and kantorovich form , respectively",

    "it is seen that in the case of resonance transmission , the redistribution of energy from the center - mass degree of freedom to the internal ( transverse ) ones takes place , i.e. , the transverse oscillator undergoes a transition from the ground state to the excited state , while in the total reflection , the redistribution of energy is extremely small , and the transverse oscillator returns to infinity in the same state .",
    "we considered a model cluster of @xmath0 identical particles bound by the oscillator - type potential that undergo quantum tunnelling through the short - range repulsive barrier potentials .",
    "the model was formulated in the new representation , which we referred as the symmetrized coordinate representation ( scr , see forthcoming paper @xcite ) , that implies construction of symmetric ( asymmetric ) combinations of oscillator wave functions in new coordinates .",

    "a system of several identical particles was considered in one - dimensional euclidian space ( @xmath5 ) .",

    "we analyzed the effect of quantum transparency , i.e. , the resonance tunnelling of several bound particles through repulsive potential barriers .",
    "we demonstrated that this effect is due to the existence of sub - barrier quasistationary states imbedded in the continuum .",
    "for the considered type of symmetric gaussian barrier potential , the energies of the s and a quasistationary states are slightly different because of the similarity of the multiplet structure of oscillator energy levels at a fixed number of particles .",
    "this fact explains a similar behavior of transmission coefficients for s and a states shifted by threshold energies .",
    "the multiplet structure of these states is varied with increasing the number of particles , e.g. , for three particles , the major peaks are double , while for two and four particles , they are single .",
    "our calculations have also shown that with increasing the energy of the initial excited state of few - body clusters , the transmission peaks demonstrate a shift towards higher energies , the set of peak positions keeping approximately the same as for the transitions from the ground state and the peaks just skipping from one position to another .    the proposed approach can be adapted and applied to tetrahedral - symmetric nuclei , quantum diffusion of molecules and micro - clusters through surfaces , and fragmentation mechanism in producing very neutron - rich light nuclei . in connection with the intense search for superheavy nuclei ,",

    "<S> a model for quantum tunnelling of a cluster comprising @xmath0 identical particles , coupled by oscillator - type potential , through short - range repulsive potential barriers is introduced for the first time in the new symmetrized - coordinate representation and studied within the s - wave approximation . the symbolic - numerical algorithms for calculating the effective potentials of the close - coupling equations in terms of the cluster wave functions and the energy of the barrier quasistationary states are formulated and implemented using the maple computer algebra system . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of quantum transparency , manifesting itself in nonmonotonic resonance - type dependence of the transmission coefficient upon the energy of the particles , the number of the particles @xmath1 , and their symmetry type , is analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the resonance behavior of the total transmission coefficient is due to the existence of barrier quasistationary states imbedded in the continuum .. </S>"
