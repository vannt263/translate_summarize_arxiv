    "in their seminal paper @xcite , y. aharonov and d. bohm claim that , contrary to the conclusions of classical mechanics , the electromagnetic 4-potential @xmath0 affects the motion of an electron beam , even in regions where the electromagnetic field vanishes .",
    "they proposed two kinds of experiments which were successfully performed later ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) .    in @xcite a scalar function @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is introduced .",
    "it has been shown that if @xmath5 is the solution of the schrdinger equation in the absence of an em field , then the function @xmath6 is the solution of the equation in the presence of the field .",
    "when the region is multiply connected , @xmath3 is not a single - valued function , and calculating @xmath3 by two non - equivalent paths can produce @xmath7 .",
    "it is argued that in the magnetic ab experiment , the difference of values of some multivalued function @xmath8 is measured .",
    "the function @xmath8 is a real - valued function of spatial coordinates and is the logarithm of the phase factor of the corresponding schrdinger equation .",
    "the ability of the four - potential @xmath0 to account for the aharonov - bohm effect is limited to the case in which the em field is zero . in this paper",
    ", we give a more precise explanation of the effect by shifting the focus from the four - potential @xmath0 to a complex - valued multifunction @xmath9 .",
    "obviously , an everywhere defined _",
    "real_-valued function @xmath9 satisfying @xmath10 can not produce a non - trivial field , since in this case the expression @xmath11 vanishes .",
    "but , as we have shown in @xcite , we can describe an electromagnetic field by a _",
    "complex_-valued function @xmath12 , which we call the _ scalar complex potential of the electromagnetic field_. the real and imaginary parts of @xmath12 are , in fact , the two scalar potentials introduced by e.  t.  whittaker in 1904 @xcite .    note that another complex scalar potential was introduced by h.  s.  green and e.  wolf in 1953 @xcite .",
    "they described the similarity of the expressions for energy and momentum densities between their potential and the wave function .",
    "the relation of this potential to the whittaker one is still unclear .",
    "let us describe the function @xmath12 in more details . given a moving charge and an observer ,",
    "we obtain a complex dimensionless scalar .",
    "we then define the scalar complex potential @xmath9 as the logarithm of this dimensionless scalar . as in @xcite ,",
    "our @xmath9 is not a multi - valued function ( it contains complex logarithm ) .",
    "moreover , we shall see that the multi - valued nature of @xmath9 is the _ tailor - made _ mathematical expression of the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "next , we derive the complex faraday vector @xmath13 of an electromagnetic field from the pre - potential @xmath9 : @xmath14 where the @xmath15 are dirac s @xmath16-matrices .",
    "these matrices @xmath17 are used to insert a lorentz invariant conjugation between the gradient and the curl as they are applied to @xmath9 .",
    "finally , we presnt a third - order differential equation expressing the connection between the complex potential @xmath12 and the field sources .",
    "denote by @xmath18 a point in space - time at which we want to calculate the four potential .",
    "we call @xmath19 the observer . denote by @xmath20 the world - line of the charge @xmath21 generating our electromagnetic field .",
    "let @xmath22 be the unique point of intersection of the past light cone at @xmath19 with the world - line @xmath20 of the charge .",
    "we denote the time of the event @xmath23 by @xmath24 and refer to this time as the _ retarded time _ of the potential .",
    "note that radiation emitted at @xmath23 will reach @xmath19 at time @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the potential at @xmath19 will depend only on the position described by the vector @xmath26 of the charge at the proper time @xmath24 .",
    "see figure 1 .",
    "let @xmath27 be an inertial reference frame in space - time with coordinates @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the speed of light .",
    "for the rest of the paper , we will use units in which @xmath30 and omit @xmath29 from equations .",
    "the inner product of two 4-vectors is defined as @xmath31 the space of 4-vectors with this inner product is minkowski space - time @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the coordinates of @xmath19 , and let @xmath34 be the coordinates of @xmath23 , the charge at the retarded time .",
    "introduce a 4-vector @xmath35 . then @xmath36 the vector @xmath37 is a null ( light - like ) vector in space - time .",
    "since @xmath38 is a null vector , we have @xmath39 we may therefore define a dimensionless complex constant @xmath40 this constant coincides with the  single complex parameter \" occurring during the stereographic projection of the celestial sphere to the agrand plane ( see @xcite v.1 p.15 ) .",
    "we want the scalar potential to be a function of the dimensionless scalar @xmath41 . to identify the `` right '' function , note that the electric force depends on the distance from the charge as @xmath42 and , as explained in the introduction , the force is a second derivative of the potential .",
    "hence , the natural candidate for the scalar potential is a multiple of the logarithm function .    *",

    "@xmath43 at the observer point@xmath44 of a moving charge @xmath21 by @xmath45 where @xmath37 is defined by ( [ a def ] ) .",
    "an electromagnetic field can be defined by an electric field intensity @xmath46 and a magnetic field intensity @xmath47 .",
    "equivalently , one can define a complex 3d - vector @xmath48 , called the faraday vector , by @xmath49 in order to represent the electromagnetic field .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath2 may be expressed as certain derivatives of the the 4-potential @xmath50 , the faraday vector @xmath48 may also be derived from the 4-potential : @xmath51 here the differential operators are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the matrices @xmath54 are the majorana - oppenheimer matrices ( see @xcite ) @xmath55 @xmath56 which were used and studied also in @xcite .",
    "direct computation shows that the matrices @xmath57 obey the commutator relations of the rotation group @xmath58 , while the @xmath59 matrices obey the commutator relations of boosts in the lorentz group , i.e. @xmath60=-\\epsilon^{jk}_l\\sigma^l,\\;\\;[\\rho^j,\\rho^k]=\\epsilon^{jk}_l\\sigma^l\\;\\ ;     [ \\sigma^j,\\rho^k]=\\epsilon^{jk}_l\\rho^l\\,.\\ ] ] as a result , we can use the six matrices @xmath61 as generators of the lie algebra of the lorentz group .",
    "in addition , the complex conjugates @xmath62 of these matrices satisfy the same commutation relations .",

    "denote by @xmath66 the complex space @xmath67 endowed with the bilinear @xmath68-valued form @xmath69 .",
    "one possible interpretation of @xmath66 is the following .",
    "let @xmath70 be the wave function of a zero spin particle .",
    "the gradient operator , describing a generalized momentum , maps space - time into @xmath66 , since @xmath71 .",
    "the bilinear form on @xmath66 is an extension of the inner product on the minkowski space - time .",
    "our complex scalar potential @xmath12 is a function @xmath72 as well .",
    "denote by @xmath73 the lift to @xmath66 of the fundamental representation of the lorentz group @xmath20 on @xmath32 , see figure  [ pirep ] .",
    "we denote by @xmath74 the representation in @xmath66 generated by matrices @xmath59 and @xmath75 ( a boost in direction @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 ) , and by @xmath78 the representation in @xmath66 generated by matrices @xmath62 and @xmath79 .",
    "note that the matrices @xmath80 are generators of boosts in direction @xmath76 .",
    "thus , using ( [ commutation of k kbar ] ) , the representation @xmath73 of the lorentz group @xmath20 can be decomposed as @xmath81 or more generally , for any @xmath82 @xmath83",
    "in @xcite a _ complex faraday tensor _ is introduced for the description of an electromagnetic field , similar to the one introduced by silberstein @xcite .",
    "this tensor is a complex matrix ( mixed tensor ) @xmath84 , with @xmath85 defined by ( [ faradayvector ] ) .",
    "we denote its complex conjugate by @xmath86 with this notation , the usual electromagnetic tensor @xmath87 can be decomposed as @xmath88 we will now prove two claims . 0.2cm**claim 1 *",
    "* the covariance of the tensor @xmath89 under the representation @xmath73 is equivalent either to the covariance of @xmath90 under @xmath74 or , equivalently , to the covariance of @xmath91 under @xmath92 .",
    "we check the covariance under the boost @xmath93 , defined by ( [ decomposition of pi boosts ] ) , in the direction @xmath76 . under this transformation , from ( [ decomp f ] ) we have @xmath94 using ( [ commutation of k kbar ] ) , we get @xmath95=[\\upsilon ^j,\\bar{\\upsilon}^l]= [ \\upsilon ^j,\\bar{\\mathcal{f}}]=[\\bar{\\upsilon } ^j,\\rho^l]=[\\bar{\\upsilon } ^j,\\mathcal{f}]=0 $ ] . hence , the above equation can be rewritten as @xmath96 this proves claim 1 for boosts .",
    "similarly , one can establish covariance under action of an arbitrary element of the group @xmath20 .",
    "0.2cm**claim 2 * * the dimensionless constant @xmath41 defined by ( [ z in cart ] ) and the complex potential @xmath12 defied by ( [ witpoint_1 ] ) are covariant under the representation @xmath74 .    note that from ( [ car ] ) , it follows that @xmath97 thus , if we apply , for example , @xmath98 on the vector @xmath38 , we get @xmath99 so , applying this transformation to @xmath41 and using the identity in ( [ z in cart ] ) , we get @xmath100 @xmath101 this proves claim 2 .",
    "to define the 4-potential @xmath0 and consequently the field strength @xmath48 , we need a new operation on @xmath66 . this operation acts by multiplication with the matrix @xmath102 , namely , @xmath103 .",
    "since the square of this operation is the identity , we call it the _ conjugation_. from ( [ commutation of k kbar ] ) it follows that this conjugation is covariant under the representation @xmath74 .",
    "define the complex 4-potential @xmath0 as the conjugate of the gradient of @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath104 the faraday vector @xmath48 can be derived from the complex potential by use of ( [ fj froma ] ) : @xmath105    this gives explicit formulas for each component of the faraday vector @xmath106 : @xmath107 and @xmath108 by the above two claims , equation ( [ f from s ] ) is covariant under the representation @xmath74 .",
    "hence , we will compare this formula with known results only in the case of a rest charge at the origin .",
    "consider a rest charge at the origin . in this case , the world - line of the charge is @xmath109 . from definition ( [ a def ] ) , we get @xmath110 , where @xmath111 .",
    "thus , @xmath112 let @xmath113 . then , since @xmath114 , we obtain @xmath115 , @xmath116 @xmath117    then , from ( [ f1 from s ] ) , we obtain @xmath118 and @xmath119 to calculate @xmath120 using ( [ f3 from s ] ) , we first calculate @xmath121 @xmath122 implying that @xmath123 since @xmath124 and @xmath125 , equation ( [ f3 from s ] ) yields @xmath126 this coincides with the usual formula for the electric force of a rest charge .    note that in this case , our complex potential satisfies the wave equation @xmath127 since the dalembertian is covariant , the wave equation holds for a field generated by any uniformly moving charge and more generally for any em field .    for a charge @xmath21 moving uniformly with 4-velocity @xmath128",
    ", the faraday vector @xmath48 can be calculated by @xmath129 where @xmath130 are defined by ( [ rho matrices ] ) . from the above calculations for a rest charge at the origin the equation ( [ fjfinal ] )",
    "holds ( in this case @xmath131 ) .",
    "since this formula is covariant , it also holds in the case of a uniformly moving charge .",
    "equation ( [ fjfinal ] ) coincides with the usual formula for the field of a moving charge ( see , for example , @xcite p. 573 ) .",
    "any electromagnetic field is generated by a collection of moving charges .",
    "we may assume that charges close to each other move with velocities that do not vary significantly .",
    "the sources of the electromagnetic field may be represented by the charge densities @xmath132 on the space - time 4-vector @xmath133 .",
    "we assume that the potential depends additively on the charges generating the field .",
    "thus , the scalar complex potential of the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath134 where @xmath135 denotes the backward light - cone at @xmath44 .",
    "the operators @xmath136 occurring in ( [ f from s ] ) satisfy the canonical anti - commutation relations similar to ( [ car ] ) of dirac s @xmath16-matrices . therefore , for any complex potential @xmath9 , equation ( [ f from s ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath137 in the newman - penrose basis of @xmath66 ( also known as bondi tetrad , see @xcite ) , the matrices @xmath15 take the usual form @xmath138 where @xmath139 are the pauli matrices .",
    "note that the matrices @xmath59 , which define the representation @xmath74 , also satisfy the canonical anti - commutation relations ( [ car ] ) .",
    "however , they can not be completed by a @xmath140 matrix , needed for the dirac equation .",
    "the representation @xmath74 is a representation of pairs of spinors , while the representation @xmath92 is a representation of pairs of dotted spinors .",
    "if the electromagnetic field sources are @xmath141 , it can be shown @xcite that the maxwell equations become @xmath142 for @xmath143 , added with the wave equation @xmath144",
    "we introduced a new description of an electromagnetic field by a complex - valued function @xmath12 ( pre - potential ) on minkowski space - time .",
    "the advantages of this approach are as follows :    * the multiple - valued nature of the pre - potential is a natural expression of the aharonov - bohm effect . * our approach reduces the degrees of freedom from 4 to 2 in the description of an electromagnetic field . * it reveals a new connection between the dirac equation and classical electrodynamics .",
    "* we obtain a new complex lorentz invariant @xmath41 associated with any null - vector . *",
