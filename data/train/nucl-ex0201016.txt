    "one of the main topics of this conference is the study of the properties of nuclear matter at high densities realized via relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the experimental studies are performed by observation of the abundance and the phase space distributions of the produced particles  @xcite .",
    "information about processes occuring during such collisions are gained , in particular , by the registration of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons  @xcite , which were created in the fireball region . however , in order to learn  from the observed kaon yields and momentum distributions  about dense baryonic matter and properties of strange particles immersed in it , the knowledge of their creation in the elementary nucleon - nucleon collisons is indispensable . to the same extent the information of their interaction with hadrons is important , since being created in the dense nuclear environment they are likely to undergo further reactions before being registered in detection systems .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to give a short overview of experimental achievements in the field of the k@xmath7 and k@xmath8 meson production in elementary proton - proton collisions close to the corresponding kinematical threshold , where due to the rapid growth of the phase space volume available to the produced particles the total cross sections increase by orders of magnitudes over a few mev range of excess energy as depicted in figure  [ alltotal ] .",
    "such studies have been made possible due to the low emittance and small momentum spread proton beams available at the storage ring facilities and in particular at the cooler synchrotron cosy .",
    "the primary motivation for the investigation of hyperon and kaon production in elementary proton - proton collisions close to threshold  where only one partial wave dominates the reaction  is i ) the understanding of the creation mechanism in the energy regime where both the hadronic and constituent quark - gluon degrees of freedom may be relevant  @xcite , and ii ) the study of low energy hadronic interactions between nucleons and strange mesons or hyperons .",
    "however , also investigations in the field of heavy ion collisions could benefit from the results of the elementary processes .",
    "a good example of the gain from comparative studies of strangeness production in heavy ion and elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions is the observation that in nuclear matter kaons undergo a repulsion , whereas anti - kaons feel a strong attractive potential .",
    "this leads to the splitting of their effective masses  @xcite .",
    "the basis for this interpretation was the observation of the kaos collaboration that the multiplicity of kaons produced in the c+c or ni+ni collisions is almost the same as for anti - kaons at the corresponding center - of - mass energy above threshold with respect to nucleon - nucleon kinematics .",
    "this was in a drastic contrast to elementary proton - proton collisions where the multiplicity of k@xmath9 mesons is determined to be two orders of magnitude larger than for anti - kaons , as can be seen in figure  [ multi_kk ] , presenting additionally to the results of kaos data taken at the laboratories cosy , saturne and bnl .",
    "the consequences of this comparison become even more astonishing if one takes into account that in nuclear matter kaons are much less absorbed than anti - kaons , since the latter in collisions with nucleons form hyperon resonances which may subsequently decay weakly into a pion - nucleon system .",
    "it is worth to note , that the repulsive hadronic interaction of kaons with protons and the attractive interaction of anti - kaons and protons is also seen in the shape of the energy dependence of the cross section for k@xmath9p or k@xmath10p elastic scattering presented in figure  [ kpkp ] . when comparing the data to calculations  including the changes of phase - space integral and coulomb interaction in the initial and final states ",
    "one observes a huge enhancement for the k@xmath10p cross section with decreasing excess energy and a slight suppression in case of k@xmath9p scattering .",
    "this observation may be attributed to the slight repulsion due to the kaon - proton hadronic interaction and significantly larger attraction caused by the strong interaction between the k@xmath10 and proton due to the vicinity of the @xmath11 hyperon resonance .",
    "the effect must have a direct influence on the kaon mass splitting in dense nuclear matter .",
    "a natural step on the way to understand the medium modification of strange meson properties is to study how the presence of a second nucleon or hyperon would influence the kaon - proton or anti - kaon proton interaction - an issue interesting in itself as well .",
    "this can be studied by measuring the energy dependence of the total cross section for the reactions @xmath12 or @xmath13 close to their corresponding kinematical thresholds  @xcite or via a study of the distribution of double differential cross sections , for example in the dalitz - plot representation  @xcite which gives the complete , experimentally obtainable , information about reactions with three particles in a final state  @xcite .",
    "a primordial motivation for studying the @xmath14 reaction close to the kinematical threshold was described extensively by w. oelert at the first cracow workshop on meson production and interaction  @xcite .",
    "it concerns the study of the hadronic interaction between k@xmath9 and k@xmath8 mesons and in particular the investigations of the still unknown origin of the scalar resonances f@xmath15(980 ) and a@xmath15(980 ) . as a possible interpretation of their structure one considers exotic four quark  @xcite , conventinal @xmath16  @xcite , or molecular like @xmath17 bound  @xcite states .    the first experiments aiming at the determination of the total cross section for the @xmath14 reaction very close to threshold showed however that it is more than seven orders of magnitude smaller than the total proton - proton production cross section ( see fig .  [ alltotal ] ) and",
    "hence the extraction of the signals required thorough investigations of possible background reactions  @xcite .",
    "the experiments are being performed at the cooler synchrotron cosy  @xcite , using the cosy-11 detection system shown in figure  [ detector ] and a hydrogen cluster target  @xcite installed in front of one of the regular cosy dipole magnets as depicted schematically in figure  [ detector ] .",
    "the target being a beam of h@xmath18 molecules grouped to clusters of up to @xmath19 atoms crosses perpendicularly the cosy beam with intensities up to  @xmath20 protons .",
    "the very thin cluster target of only @xmath21 atoms/@xmath22 makes the probability of secondary scattering negligible and hence allows the precise determination of the ejectile momenta .",
    "however , despite the low density of the target it is still possible to measure reactions whith cross sections in the nanobarn region , since the proton beam circulating in the ring hits the target more than @xmath19 times per second resulting in luminosities of up to  @xmath23  @xmath24s@xmath25 .",
    "if at the intersection point of the cluster target and cosy beam a collision of protons leads to the production of a k@xmath7k@xmath8 meson pair , then the ejected particles  having smaller momenta than the circulating beam  are directed by the magnetic field towards the detection system and leave the vacuum chamber through the thin exit foils  @xcite .",
    "tracks of the positively charged particles , registered by the drift chambers , are traced back through the magnetic field to the nominal interaction point , leading to a momentum determination .",
    "a simultanous measurement of the velocity , performed by means of scintillation detectors , permits to identify the registered particle and to determine its four momentum vector . since at threshold the center - of - mass momenta of the produced particles are small in comparison to the beam momentum , in the laboratory all ejectiles are moving with almost the same velocity .",
    "this means that the laboratory proton momenta are almost two times larger then the momenta of kaons and therefore in the dipole magnetic field protons expierience a much larger lorentz force than kaons . as a consequence , in case of the near threshold production , protons and kaons are registered in separate parts of the drift chambers as shown schematically in figure  [ detector ] .",
    "figure  [ invmass](left ) shows the squared mass of two simultaneously detected particles in the right half of the drift chamber .",
    "a clear separation is observed into groups of events with two protons , two pions , proton and pion and also deuteron and pion .",
    "this spectrum enables to select events with two registered protons .",
    "the additional requirement that the mass of the third particle , registered at the left side of the chamber , corresponds to the mass of the kaon allows to identify events with a @xmath26 reaction signature . knowing both the four momenta of positively charged ejectiles and the proton beam momentum one can calculate the mass of an unobserved system @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ invmass](middle ) presents the square of the missing mass spectrum with respect to the identified ppk@xmath7 subsystem . in case of the @xmath28 reaction",
    "this should correspond to the mass of the @xmath6 meson , and indeed a pronounced signal can be clearly recognised .",
    "the additional broad structure seen in the figure is partly due to the @xmath29 reaction , where the @xmath30 was misidentified as a k@xmath7 meson but also due to k@xmath7 meson production associated with the hyperons @xmath31(1405 ) or @xmath32(1385 ) , e.g. via the reaction @xmath33 . in this case",
    "the missing mass of the ppk@xmath7 system corresponds to the invariant mass of the @xmath34 system and hence can acquire values from twice the pion mass up to the kinematical limit .",
    "this background , however , can be completely reduced by demanding a signal in the silicon strip detectors at the position where the k@xmath8 meson originating from the @xmath14 reaction is expected  @xcite .",
    "this clear identification allows to determine the total cross section and the corresponding multiplicity shown in figures  [ alltotal ] and [ multi_kk ] , respectively .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ multi_kk ] represents results of calculations  @xcite for the @xmath14 reaction taking into account the changes of the production amplitude as deduced from the k@xmath7p and k@xmath8p elastic scattering shown in figure  [ kpkp ] , but neglecting the influence of the dominant proton - proton interaction ! on the other hand the proton - proton fsi in case of three body final states e.g.  @xmath35  @xcite , @xmath36  @xcite , or @xmath37",
    "@xcite influences strongly the total cross section energy dependence by enhancing it by more than an order of magnitude for excess energies below q  @xmath38  15  mev .",
    "thus it is surprising that in spite of its neglection one can describe the data of the @xmath14 reaction .",
    "the origin of that effect will be investigated experimentally in the near future  @xcite . at present one can only speculate whether it is due to the partial compensation of the pp and k@xmath8p hadronic interaction or maybe by the additional degree of freedom given by the four body final state  @xcite . at present it is also not possible to judge to what extent the close to threshold production of k@xmath7k@xmath8 pairs proceeds through the intermediate doorway state f@xmath39(980 ) .",
    "the experimentally determined distribution of the missing mass with respect to the proton - proton system is shown in figure  [ invmass](right ) and demonstrates that the non - resonant k@xmath7k@xmath8 production ( shaded area ) is hardly distinguishable from the resonant @xmath40 reaction sequence ( dashed line )  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the up to date statistics of the data is not sufficient to favour one of the two processes .",
    "recently , the mass spectrum of the k@xmath7k@xmath8 pair produced via the @xmath14 reaction was calculated in the framework of the @xmath41 model of the jlich group for cases where f@xmath39 is a genuine meson or @xmath42 bound state  @xcite .",
    "however , again the present statistics is not enough to distinguish between the two hypotheses .",
    "the kaon production associated with the hyperon @xmath31 or @xmath43 is studied experimentally very close to threshold at the internal facility cosy-11",
    "@xcite presented in the previous section and also complementary for the higher energies at the large acceptance non - magnetic time - of - flight spectrometer cosy - tof  @xcite which functioning shall be presented below .",
    "the tof detector consists of four rotationally symmetric detection layers positioned close to the lh@xmath44 liquid hydrogen target  @xcite and the `` quirl '' scintillation hodoscope  @xcite as shown schematically in figure  [ tofdetector ] . to minimize multiple scattering of beam protons and reaction products",
    "the whole system is enclosed in a vacuum vessel consisting of 3  m outer diameter barrel elements providing up to 8  m flight path in vacuum .",
    "an event from a production of a neutral hyperon  with a mean decay path of a few cm  gives only two signals in the target start detectors and four in the fiber ring hodoscopes as is depicted in figure  [ tofdetector ] .",
    "this allows to use a very selective trigger based on the hit multiplicity in the scintillation detectors .",
    "hit positions measured in the start detector , in the double sided micro - strip silicon detector , the four layers of fiber scintillators and in the `` quirl '' or `` ring '' scintillation hodoscopes permit the precise reconstruction of the primary and decay vertices .",
    "from the reconstructed tracks after a mass assignment four - momentum vectors of all registered particles may be determined for each event . due to the possibility of monitoring the beam - target luminosity both cosy-11 and tof experiments can establish not only cross section distributions but also their absolute magnitude .",
    "gernerally the knowlegde of four - momentum vectors of all ejectiles , for each event , allows to study the low energy interaction among the produced particles , and specifically the hyperon - nucleon or kaon - nucleon interaction .",
    "a quantitative study of the dalitz - plot occupation in case of the @xmath12 reaction performed by the cosy-11 collaboration resulted already in the estimation of scattering length and effective range parameters averaged over the spin states , with values of 2  fm and 1  fm being extracted , respectively  @xcite .    with the installation of neutron detectors  @xcite both the tof and cosy-11 facility allow also to study charged hyperon production , for example @xmath45 via the @xmath46 reaction .",
    "in case of the cosy-11 setup the neutron detector is positioned as shown in figure  [ detector ] and in case of the tof facility it is installed behind the `` quirl '' scintillation detector . using the tof facility the @xmath47 reaction",
    "can again be identified by the event topology combined with the mass hypothesis and the missing mass method , whereas in case of cosy-11 the measurements of kaons and neutrons will allow to recognise the reaction via the missing mass technique only .",
    "data on the close to threshold kaon production are necessary in order to learn about the strangeness production mechanisms .",
    "especially , they are needed to verify the hypothesis of the destructive interference between @xmath48 and k meson exchanges  @xcite , proposed to explain the cosy-11 observation that close to threshold the @xmath5 meson , when associated with the hyperon @xmath31 is by a factor of @xmath4930 more copiously produced than when created together with a @xmath43 hyperon  @xcite .",
    "presently , an additional tracking system consisting of straw chambers and silicon micro - strip detectors is being built for the tof installation , which will improve the tracking possibilities and as a consequence allow for the registration of more complex decay patterns originating e.g. from the production of hyperons belonging to the 3/2 decuplet  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the production of the @xmath50 hyperon associated with the k@xmath51 meson can be identified by the reconstruction of the @xmath52 prompt decay geometry and the delayed decays with separate vertices @xmath53 and @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "the upgrade of the cosy-11 detection system by a new hexagonal drift chamber  @xcite and a @xmath55erenkov detector  @xcite increases the efficiency of the kaon detection and its distinction from pions , which together with a near future installation of a spectator detector  @xcite will allow to measure close to threshold cross sections for the quasi - free @xmath56 reactions .",
