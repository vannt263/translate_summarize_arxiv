    "[ rescaled equipotentials ] from this corollary we see that if the frobenius condition is satisfied locally by a nonvanishing vector field @xmath20 , then @xmath20 can still be expressed in terms of a scalar potential @xmath15 and one still has the notion of equipotentials , but the equipotentials are rescaled by an _ integrating factor _ @xmath16 . the hypothesis that @xmath20 is locally nonvanishing",

    "this notion of twisting will be key to defining _ near force - free _ magnetic fields and their relation to the giroux correspondence .    we are now positioned to see how twisting , in a well - defined topological sense , is related to quantities familiar from maxwell s electrodynamics .",

    "says that in regions where the magnetic field and heating are nonzero , one must have either a nontrivial lorentz force or twisted field lines . in this paper",
    "we exploit this local identity and the notion of a confoliation , to globally characterize the topology of _ near force - free _ magnetic fields .",
    "the notion of _ current helicity _ and the eignvalue problem for linear force - free fields will play a key role .",
    "if we identify the magnetic field intensity as a 1-form , @xmath43 , the _ current helicity functional _ associated with the magnetic field on a region @xmath19 is @xmath44    the fact that the current helicity functional , when expressed in terms of differential forms , depends only on the exterior derivative and the wedge product but not on the hodge star , leads to important invariance properties :    1 .",
    "this integral is diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "however , in the physical interpretation of the current helicity , it is the current which has to be identified with the 2-form @xmath45 .",

    "what is striking is that as a lie algebra , @xmath47 has an  invariant bilinear form `` and it is precisely the bilinear form associated with the helicity functional .",
    "this bilinear form has a conceptually satisfying topological interpretation as arnold s ' ' mean asymptotic linking number \" not being simply connected . ] .",
    "the integral is _ gauge invariant _ in the sense that if one adds an exact 1-form to @xmath30 , an  integration by parts \" shows that the integral changes by a boundary term which vanishes under suitable lagrangian boundary conditions . since this is independent of any riemannian metric , it has interesting consequences in the context of hodge decompositions .",
    "we will now see how the current helicity enables to construct linear force - free fields arise as eigenfields of the @xmath48 operator by means of a variational formulation .",
    "relative to the hodge inner product , @xmath49 an  integration by parts \" formula shows that curl is formally self - adjoint : @xmath50 if @xmath19 is a compact manifold with boundary , the boundary term is a symplectic form .",
    "if we impose  lagrangian boundary conditions \" , the boundary term vanishes and the curl operator becomes a self - adjoint fredholm operator in some sobolev - like space where the gradients have been  quotiented out \" .",
    "we then have a countable number of finite energy divergence - zero eigenfields satisfying an equation of the form : @xmath51    [ helicityevp ] in terms of the current helicity functional , the linear force - free magnetic field problem now has variational formulation . that is , to find the stationary points of @xmath52 subject to lagrangian boundary conditions and the normalization @xmath53 imposed via a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the eigenfield corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalue having the smallest absolute value can be interpreted as either the magnetic field which has the most twisting for a given amount of energy , or the magnetic field with the least energy for a given amount of twisting .",
    "what is unexpectedly elegant is that when the helicity functional is restricted to a finite domain , the diffeomorphism - invariant lagrangian boundary conditions which render the curl operator self - adjoint depend only on the lagrangian subspaces of the first homology group of the boundary .",
    "see ( @xcite ) for details .",
    "even more rewarding is that all these properties have a discrete counterpart under whitney - form finite element discretization .",
    "[ bigevpplans ] by restricting the curl operator to subdomains and solving finding the eigenfunctions of the curl operator on these subdomains , one can construct a global force - free magnetic fields out of piecewise linear force - free fields .",

    "specifically , we plan to apply these ideas to the _ binding of an open book_.    before developing a topological characterization of force - free magnetic fields in terms of  open books \" , we now relate foliations to notions from electromagnetics .",

    "genus minimizing coembs ?",
    "minimal area coembs ?",
    "some valuable insights follow from preliminary observations :    @xmath142 the disc is a cut for the textbook example of a circular planar loop and it enjoys all of these properties .",
    "however , textbook examples are of little use for probing the rhetorical question . the algorithm based on a harmonic map into the circle , proposed and implemented decades ago ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", ensures that the cut is a coemb and finds it in polynomial time with polynomial order quadratic in the worst case ( so far so good ) . realizing cuts as embedded manifolds is not a logical necessity and so a pragmatic person may question the need to have embeddings in the first place .",
    "however embedded level sets of an elliptic equation come as a by - product of the algorithm and are relatively easy to visualize and understand ( unlike immersions ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no conjectures about having a level set which is either genus or area minimizing .",
    "@xmath142 given the discussion of the topological characterization of force - free magnetic fields ( via thurston and alexander norms ) , it would be wonderful if there were a robust algorithm to produce a cut realized as a genus minimizing coemb .",
    "unfortunately , thurston et.al.@xcite have shown that there is no polynomial time algorithm that produces a coemb of minimal genus .",
    "in general we can replace the harmonic map functional by the @xmath143 norm of the magnitude of the gradient .",
    "when we do this for the @xmath144 norm , the solution gives an area minimizing current ( in the sense of de rham ) .",
    "however this does not ensure that the solution is unique or an area minimizing coemb and the discretized problem leads to a linear programming problem for which no worst - case polynomial time algorithm exists .",
    "@xmath142 thurston and almgren @xcite , produced unknotted curves which bound only surfaces of high genus within their convex hulls .",
    "since any minimal surface lies in the convex hull of its boundary , this shows that in general one can not expect to find a coemb which is both area minimizing and minimal genus .",
    "incidentally , their examples involve unknotted smooth curves with relatively small curvature !    from these deliberations on what a nice cut might be ,",
    "it is clear that in developing a general algorithm , the harmonic map approach not only side - steps the pitfalls of exponential time algorithms but the solution time is quadratic in the worst case , and practical in practice .",
    "the nonexistence of polynomial time algorithms to handle area or genus minimization reinforced the  computable but unintuitive \" nature of this solution , yet those who sought  a nicer and more intuitive \" solution still grieve !    [ four late - onset blind ] the work on cuts , as presented so far , exposed us to the work of pontryagin and giroux .",
    "as we wrestle with the more intuitive questions , we come face to face with the work of other late - onset blind geometers and topologists .",
    "first , the problem of area minimization leads to plateau s problem .",
    "joseph plateau was a belgian solar physicist who was completely blind by the age of forty as a result of staring at the sun .",
    "he lived to the age of eighty and his work on capillary forces and minimal surfaces was undertaken long after he was blind !",
    "second , in the process of understanding embedded and immersed cuts the problem of sphere eversion emerges@xcite .",
    "that is , turning the sphere inside out homotopically through immersions .",
    "it was bernard morin who first showed the world how to visualize the sphere eversion .",
    "what was strange was that he was blind from the age of six .",
    "bottom line : in the quest for _ nice cuts _ , the above paragraphs drops the names of four late - onset blind topologists .",
    "a conclusion one can draw from this exploration is that , in the process of coming up with efficient and effective algorithms to compute cuts , one discovers key topologists and geometers who gave us the tools to construct and visualize cuts and force - free magnetic fields ( pontryagin , giroux , plateau , morin ) , who were all blinded after the age of five and did their significant mathematical work years after they were blinded .",

    "it is difficult to talk about this faustian bargain since written communication and planar diagrams had been ingrained in our culture since well before the enlightenment .",

    "productive mathematicians also find it a distraction to ask how they prove results given their nationality , gender , physiology , or on account of some other characteristic such as a disability .",
    "if one tries to identify those who avoid the topological faustian bargain , one must start with groups of mathematicians whose use of spatial reasoning is not inspired by the page to begin with , and identify topics that are not amenable to representation on a page .",
    "the author speculates there are at least three such groups .",
    "the first group consists of _ astronomers_. although astronomy is highly automated today with many specialists , in previous centuries it was not only at the cutting edge of theoretical physics and experimental technique , but also on the cutting edge of the mathematics .",

    "at least four of gauss students are trained as astronomers ( bessel , gerling , encke , and von staudt ) , and they generate almost all of gauss academic descendants .",

    "two dimensions may suffice for a textbook explanation of kepler s contributions , but subsequent developments in astronomy required much more .",
    "these astronomers had a great impact on the techniques of n - dimensional geometry .",

    "the second group consists of @xmath145 century _",
    "rock climbers_. although _ rock climbing topologist _ conjures up many names , let s focus on three : james waddell alexander ii ( 1888 - 1971 ) , georges de rham ( 1903 - 1990 ) and hassler whitney ( 1907 - 1989 ) .",
