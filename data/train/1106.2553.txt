    "investigations of the molecular and dusty interstellar medium ( ism ) in high redshift galaxies are of key importance to studies of galaxy evolution at early cosmic times , as the ism provides the material that fuels star formation and stellar mass assembly .",
    "it is particularly interesting to better understand the ism properties of galaxies that host both intense star formation and a luminous active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , as this enables simultaneous investigations of supermassive black hole and stellar bulge growth in galaxies .",
    "a key cosmic epoch for such studies is the redshift range 2@xmath9@xmath0@xmath93 , where both cosmic star formation and agn activity peak , and thus , where most of the growth of stellar and black hole mass in galaxies occurs ( e.g. , magnelli et al.@xcite ; richards et al .",
    ".    some of the most remarkable distant agn - starburst galaxies are gas - rich , far - infrared luminous quasars at @xmath0@xmath72 .",
    "to date , the molecular ism of 34 high-@xmath0 quasars has been detected through emission from rotational lines of co , 14 of which are gravitationally lensed ( see review by solomon & vanden bout @xcite , and riechers @xcite for a recent summary ) .",
    "given the sensitivity of past observatories , gravitational lensing is key to probe down to intrinsically fainter ( and thus , more common ) systems .",
    "one key aspect of these studies is that most detections were obtained in mid-@xmath5 ( i.e. , @xmath5@xmath63 ) co transitions .",
    "only three of the 34 quasars were observed in the ground - state  line ( e.g. , carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ; riechers et al .",
    "it thus remains a possibility that many of these studies are biased toward the highly excited gas that does not necessarily trace the entire molecular gas reservoir seen in .    to overcome the limitations of previous studies , we have initiated a systematic study of the  content of high-@xmath0 quasars and other galaxy populations with the expanded very large array ( evla ; perley et al .",

    "<S> we report the detection of  emission in the strongly lensed high - redshift quasars irasf10214 + 4724 ( @xmath0=2.286 ) , the cloverleaf ( @xmath0=2.558 ) , rxj0911 + 0551 ( @xmath0=2.796 ) , smmj04135 + 10277 ( @xmath0=2.846 ) , and mg0751 + 2716 ( @xmath0=3.200 ) , using the expanded very large array and the green bank telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we report lensing - corrected  line luminosities of @xmath1k pc@xmath2 and total molecular gas masses of @xmath3m@xmath4 for the sources in our sample . based on co line ratios relative to previously reported observations in @xmath5@xmath63 rotational transitions and line excitation modeling , we find that the  line strengths in our targets are consistent with single , highly - excited gas components with constant brightness temperature up to mid-@xmath5 levels . </S>",
    "<S> we thus do not find any evidence for luminous extended , low excitation , low surface brightness molecular gas components . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are comparable to those found in @xmath0@xmath74 quasars with existing  observations . </S>",
    "<S> these findings stand in contrast to recent  observations of @xmath0@xmath824 submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) , which have lower co excitation and show evidence for multiple excitation components , including some low - excitation gas . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are consistent with the picture that gas - rich quasars and smgs represent different stages in the early evolution of massive galaxies . </S>"
