    "the coupling between the angular momentum of photons and the spin angular momentum of carriers , termed optical orientation,@xcite has been so far recognized as one of the main challenges in group iv materials.@xcite the poor absorption and emission efficiencies , associated to the weak electric - dipole transitions of the fundamental indirect - gap of such semiconductors , jeopardized the optical exploitation of their rich spin physics .",
    "indeed , silicon and germanium feature lattice inversion symmetry and predominant spin - less isotopes,@xcite yielding long spin coherence times.@xcite this feature is crucial for the effective implementation of spintronic devices,@xcite and quantum information processing.@xcite    only very recently , however , the quasi - direct behavior of ge has sparked interest in its photonic properties,@xcite and stimulated the use of various optical schemes aiming at addressing its spin physics.@xcite in ge , the absolute minimum of the conduction band ( cb ) is at the @xmath1  point of the brillouin zone , but there exists a local minimum at the zone - center @xmath2 . at low temperature",
    "the former leads to an indirect energy gap of 0.744  ev,@xcite the latter to a direct - gap of 0.898  ev.@xcite optical orientation via absorption of circularly polarized photons at the direct energy gap can then be exploited to readily investigate the spin properties of ge.@xcite noticeably , spin - polarized electrons optically pumped in the @xmath2 valley can conserve their spin during ultrafast scattering to the lower energy @xmath1 valleys,@xcite which are responsible for charge and spin transport .",
    "such mechanism , which is absent in the widely studied iii - v semiconductors , makes ge spin dynamics very rich , but still poorly understood .",
    "in addition , it provides a viable approach to inject spin - polarized carriers in ge without relying on ferromagnetic gate stacks , which are prone to low efficiency and experimental artifacts due to defects and localized interfacial states.@xcite    optical orientation has indeed recently allowed progress in the investigation of spin dynamics of both electrons and holes in bulk ge .",
    "spin relaxation times of holes have been shown to be below 1  ps,@xcite whereas electron spin relaxation times are in the ns range below 200  k.@xcite yet very little is known about spin flip scattering by dopants and the role played by impurities in determining spin dynamics in different temperature regimes.@xcite    inspired by the quasi direct - gap behavior of ge and by the possibility to optically initialize spins , we report in this work a spin - polarized photoluminescence ( pl ) study focused on the recombination across the direct - gap of bulk ge over a wide doping and temperature range .",
    "we directly measured the polarization state of the direct - gap emission by means of stokes analysis,@xcite shedding light on the optical orientation process and on the interplay between energy and spin relaxation channels .",
    "the role of carrier thermalization and cooling in determining luminescence polarization in ge are disclosed by monte carlo simulations , in which non - equilibrium kinetics of photoexcited electrons is used to extract the circular polarization degree of the emitted light under steady state conditions .",
    "our analysis shows that in ge the state of light polarization of the direct - gap emission is governed by kinetics of spin - polarized electrons , highlighting the role of energy relaxation of hot electrons within the @xmath0 valleys .",
    "the direct comparison between theory and experiments points out that above 170  k back - scattering of unpolarized electrons from @xmath1 to @xmath2 valley leads to a decay of the circular polarization degree of direct - gap emission , no matter the doping of the bulk samples .",
    "remarkably , at temperatures below 170  k a complete reversal of the helicity of light polarization can be obtained either by changing the doping level or the lattice temperature .",
    "in addition , a maximum in the polarization degree of the emitted light is obtained around 100 - 150  k , reaching in intrinsic ge samples surprisingly high values , i.e. larger than @xmath3 .",
    "such puzzling behavior stems for the complex carrier dynamics taking place in the multi - valley band structure of ge , where the electron spin ( and ensuing direct - gap luminescence polarization ) is dictated by cooling of hot electrons via coulomb collisions and intervalley scattering between @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys .",

    "[ subsec : pl ]",
    ". the density of ` low - energy ' electrons can significantly increase at higher temperatures because of the band gap shrinkage and because carrier - carrier interactions become relevant .",

    "the density of ` high - energy ' electrons reaching the bottom of the @xmath2 valley after relaxation strongly depends on doping conditions . in the intrinsic sample ,",
    "the energy relaxation of ` high - energy ' electrons is governed by phonon - induced intervalley scattering between @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys where after each phonon emission the electron lose a few tens of mev .",
    "since it is highly likely for ` high - energy ' electrons to be transferred out of the @xmath2 valley during such energy relaxation , the direct - gap luminescence is governed by ` low - energy ' electrons .",
    "this physics explains the positive and high circular polarization degree from the intrinsic sample at low temperatures ( in spite of the relatively small population of ` low - energy ' electrons at these temperatures ) . in the doped samples , on the other hand ,",
    "the energy relaxation of ` high - energy ' electrons is governed by collisions with the background carriers .",
    "these coulomb collisions come from a binary process in which a photoexcited electron collides with a background carrier,@xcite and also a collective process in which the photoexcited electron interacts with the thermal plasma of background carriers.@xcite    the energy relaxation of photoexcited electrons due to coulomb collisions is effective in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 valleys but not in the @xmath2 valley .",
    "this difference stems from the effective mass as explained in sec .",
    "a typical scenario at low temperatures is that photoexcited electrons in the @xmath2  valley experience phonon - induced intervalley scattering to one of the @xmath0 valleys since it has higher rate compared with scattering to the @xmath1 valleys.@xcite the hot electrons then thermalize to the bottom of the @xmath0  valley via the plasmon and carrier - carrier scattering mechanisms .",
    "the phonon - induced intervalley scattering typically takes place after electrons reach the bottom of the @xmath0 valley transferring some of the electrons back to the @xmath2 valley whereas most scatter to the @xmath1 valley . since @xmath107  mev , electrons that scatter back to the @xmath2  valley",
    "reach the valley bottom where they can effectively contribute to the direct band gap luminescence .",
    "these characteristics lead to the similarity between the curves of the fairly doped samples , despite of the big gap in the doping level of @xmath8-ge and @xmath104-ge , namely @xmath108  @xmath109 and @xmath110  @xmath109 . for @xmath111-ge ( @xmath112  @xmath109 ) ,",
    "the plasmon scattering is negligible , and the binary carrier - carrier scattering is not as efficient at low temperatures .",
    "its circular polarization degree is therefore located in between the heavily - doped and intrinsic samples , as expected .",
    "finally , we note that the cooling process in the @xmath0 valley mediated by background impurities is expected to lead to an increase of the direct - gap emission with the doping level .",
    "such a general result has to take place in both @xmath8- and @xmath4-doped ge samples . in the former ,",
    "this contribution sums up to the higher electron population due to the increased fermi level with @xmath8-type doping.@xcite",
    "in this work we have reported a joint experimental and theoretical study of the polarization of light emitted in transitions across the direct band gap of bulk ge .",
    "the optical investigation , based upon polarimetric analysis , provides compelling confirmation that optical orientation of carrier spin can be achieved in bulk ge .",
    "the detailed analysis of the state of light polarization further demonstrates that the degree and helicity of direct - gap emission remarkably depend upon parameters such as doping and temperature .",
    "we emphasize that by combining continuous - wave polarization - resolved pl experiments and monte carlo calculations , we gather simultaneous information about spin and carrier relaxation mechanisms , without relying on time resolved techniques . indeed , in the optical orientation process , electrons are photo - generated in the @xmath2 valley from optically coupled heavy hole or split - off valence band states at different energies and with opposite spin orientation .",
    "such an information does not get wiped out during the subsequent radiative recombination , because , owing to the ultrafast lifetime of @xmath2 electrons,@xcite it remains encoded in the angular momentum of the emitted light . as a result , the measurement of the helicity and polarization degree of the band - edge luminescence allows us to keep track of the dominant non - equilibrium spin - polarized population of electrons experiencing radiative recombination , and to infer important information about energy and spin relaxation channels .",
    "thermal activation of unpolarized @xmath1 valley electrons is shown to explain the luminescence depolarization at high temperatures , whereas the doping level accounts for the different state of light polarization in the low temperature regime .",
    "finally , our findings point out the pivotal impact in the cooling process of hot electrons played by carrier - plasmon scattering within the @xmath0 valleys , whose role in defining carrier dynamics has been largely overlooked in many of the previous literature works dealing with direct - gap luminescence in ge .",
    "the study of the injection of spin - polarized carriers and of circularly polarized emission at the direct - gap of ge is important also application wise .",
    "we anticipate that a systematic calibration in the low temperature regime of the dependence of the polarization degree @xmath25 upon doping can possibly lead to the development of a diagnostic tool for the determination of the impurity content in ge .",
    "such spectroscopic method is non - destructive and has a high spatial resolution ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "in addition , it does not require accurate sample preparation and can be applied to address a doping range not easily accessible by conventional techniques , e.g. energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "finally , the recently discovered lasing action in ge on si heterostructures,@xcite albeit debated,@xcite holds the promise of laser sources monolithically integrated onto the mainstream cmos platform,@xcite thus filling the gap for the development of the active devices needed to ground si - photonics . at present",
    ", however , direct - gap electroluminescence@xcite and lasing@xcite in ge - based heterostructures have been achieved only under high current densities and shown to be not efficient yet.@xcite such drawbacks strongly hamper the widespread application of ge - based light sources .",
    "we suggest , however , that pursuing the concept of spin - based ge emitters can provide a sizable improvement in this field.@xcite pumping spin - polarized carriers in the optical gain medium by using spin selective contacts or circularly polarized light can reduce the injection threshold required for electroluminescence or lasing action , finally boosting the performances of the ge emitters and their implementation into si - photonics circuits .",
