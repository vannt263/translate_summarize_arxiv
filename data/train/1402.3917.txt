    "one of the central problems in applied mathematics is the analysis of signals .",
    "usually signals are modelled by functions in suitable functions spaces ( e.g. , @xmath4 or sobolev spaces ) and they might be given explicitly or implicitly as the solution of an operator equation .",
    "in most applications , the signal is transformed via a mapping into a suitable parameter space where it is easier to extract the information of interest . by discretization ,",
    "one obtains suitable building blocks that give rise to a discrete representation of the signal and can be used to decompose , compress and process the signal . over the years , many different transforms have been derived in response to particular problems , including the wavelet and gabor transforms .",
    "representation theory , however , gives a general approach to construct continuous transforms for @xmath4-functions , and coorbit space theory allows both to extend these transforms to more general function spaces and to provide discrete systems .",
    "indeed , it was shown that virtually all well - known transforms used in signal analysis can be derived from this general setting . in this sense ,",
    "coorbit space theory serves as a common thread in the jungle of all possible signal transformations .",
    "nevertheless , as will be explained below , the classical coorbit space setting relies on specific assumptions that might be hard to verify in practice .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how to weaken these basic assumptions with the goal of extending the applicability of this framework to a much larger class of problems .",
    "coorbit space theory was originally introduced by h. feichtinger and k. grchenig in a series of papers in 1988 - 89 @xcite . by means of this theory , given a square integrable representation ,",
    "it is possible to construct in an efficient and systematic way a full scale of smoothness spaces where the smoothness of a function is measured by the decay of the so - called _",
    "voice transform_. for any unitary representation @xmath5 of a locally compact topological group @xmath0 on a hilbert space @xmath6 and a fixed @xmath7 , the voice transform @xmath8 is the map assigning to @xmath9 the corresponding transform @xmath10 as @xmath11 ranges in @xmath0 .",
    "evidently , @xmath12 is a function on the group .",
    "since @xmath6 is often a hilbert space of functions , the voice transform connects two function spaces , that is , it maps signals to functions on the group .",
    "coorbit space theory has been very successful in many ways and has given rise to a wealth of results , enabling to derive a very large family of smoothness spaces as coorbit spaces , including both classical functions spaces and new ones .",
    "in particular , the classical besov spaces are derived as coorbit spaces where smoothness is measured by the decay of the wavelet transform , i.e. , the voice transform associated with the affine group .",
    "similarly , the well - established class of modulation spaces corresponds to the family of coorbit spaces where smoothness is measured by the decay of the gabor transform , i.e. , the voice transform associated with the weyl - heisenberg group ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as another example ,",
    "let us mentions the @xmath13modulation spaces @xcite which can be interpreted as coorbit spaces related to group representations modulo quotients @xcite .",
    "another advantage of coorbit space theory is to provide atomic decompositions and banach frames for the coorbit spaces , through a procedure which generates discrete function systems by discretization of the group representation .",
    "this is important since it provides a way to understand the properties of discrete signal representations through the group theoretic properties of their corresponding continuous voice transforms .    in recent years",
    ", a new generation of multiscale transforms has emerged in applied harmonic analysis , such as the shearlet and curvelet transforms , which were introduced to overcome the limitations of the traditional multiscale framework in multi - dimensional setting with high efficiency @xcite .",
    "recent results have shown that the continuous shearlet transform , in particular , stems from a square integrable group representation of the so - called _ full shearlet group _ @xcite . by applying the coorbit space theory to this setup",
    ", it is possible to define some useful anisotropic smoothness spaces via the decay properties of the shearlet transform and to relate these spaces to other well - known function spaces @xcite .",
    "this has stimulated the investigation of a larger class of group representations , primarily those arising from the restriction of the metaplectic representation to a class of triangular subgroups of the symplectic group @xcite .",
    "this class includes many known cases of interest in signal analysis and gives rise to several new examples , such as the schrdingerlets that we discuss in this paper .",
    "yet another potential extension of this framework is the general context of the so - called mock metaplectic representations , introduced in @xcite .",
    "however , the classical coorbit space theory appears to be too restrictive to deal with this more general class of group representations and the corresponding voice transforms and function spaces .",
    "let us recall that the classical coorbit space theory _  la _ feichtinger - grchenig makes the following two assumptions : + ( fg1 ) the _ kernel _ @xmath14 , that is , the voice transform of the admissible vector itself , is an absolutely integrable function on the group .",
    "+ ( fg2 ) the representation is assumed to be irreducible .",
    "+ a major part of this paper is concerned with replacing ( fg1 ) by some weaker condition .",
    "the fundamental concepts will be presented in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "first of all , let us mention that the problem of removing the integrability condition has already been addressed by j. christensen and g. lafsson in @xcite .",
    "classically , the reservoir of test functions is obtained by taking the functions whose voice transform is in @xmath15 , hence it is a banach space in a natural way . in the papers @xcite , the reservoir is a fixed frchet space @xmath16 densely embedded into @xmath6 .",
    "the basic example is the set of @xmath17 vectors for the representation .",
    "the approach that we consider in this paper is indeed similar to @xcite , but features an important new datum that we call the _ target space _ @xmath18 .",
    "this is a frchet space of functions on @xmath0 and plays the role of @xmath15 in the classical setup . in our theory , the reservoir @xmath16 is the set of functions whose voice transform is in @xmath18 .",
    "in section 4 , we provide a new model for the target space , namely @xmath19 for this choice we are able to produce concrete cases arising from triangular subgroups of @xmath20 , notably the case of the so - called _ schrdingerlets _ , discussed in section 4.3 . as a toy example , in section 4.2 we also consider the case of the band - limited functions with @xmath21 but not in @xmath22 . ] .    as for assumption ( fg2 ) ,",
    "most of the classical coorbit space theory can be carried out also in the reducible case . in the irreducible case ,",
    "it is possible to show that the construction of the coorbit spaces is independent of the choice of the admissible vector .",
    "exactly this property is lost in the reducible case , as showed by an important example in @xcite . neither in @xcite nor in our setting irreducibility is needed . in section  [ av ]",
    "we give a reasonable description of admissible vectors leading to the same coorbit spaces .",
    "finally , in section  [ l1 ] we present a detailed account of the extent to which the classical @xmath22 theory can be developed without the assumption of irreducibility .",
    "let us briefly describe in some detail the main features of our approach .",
    "the starting ingredients are a unitary reproducing representation @xmath5 of a locally compact second countable group @xmath0 on a separable hilbert space @xmath6 and an admissible vector @xmath7 .",
    "next , the frchet spaces @xmath16 and @xmath1 come into play , and their roles in the theory can be described by the following very basic conceptual picture @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the space of measurable functions on @xmath0 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 and @xmath18 are frchet spaces that embed into @xmath6 and @xmath24 , respectively , and should therefore be thought of as signals and functions on the group , respectively .",
    "the space @xmath1 is a free choice , as long as one can embed it continuously into @xmath24 in such a way that some basic properties are satisfied ( assumptions [ h1 ] and [ h2 ] ) .",
    "the space @xmath25 will serve as the reservoir of _ test functions _ and it is defined as the subset of @xmath6 consisting of those vectors whose voice transform belongs to @xmath26 .",
    "test functions are modeled in terms of their voice transforms and the latter ones constitute the true degree of freedom in the construction , the target space  @xmath18 .    once the basic structures are laid out , one then follows the lines of coorbit space theory and defines first the distributions @xmath27 and then coorbits associated to banach spaces of functions .",
    "technically speaking , our theory is determined by the data set @xmath28 , where :    * @xmath0 is a locally compact second countable topological group ; * @xmath6 is a separable hilbert space ; * @xmath5 is a continuous unitary reproducing representation of @xmath0 on @xmath6 ; * @xmath7 is an admissible vector ; * @xmath1 is a frchet space continuously embedded via @xmath29 into @xmath24 ; * @xmath30 is a banach space continuously embedded in @xmath31 and left invariant .",
    "the main ancillary objects attached to them are :    * the voice transform @xmath32 ; * the reproducing kernel @xmath33 ; * the reproducing kernel space @xmath34 ; * the space of test functions @xmath35 ; * the space of distributions @xmath36 ; * the extended voice transform @xmath37 ; * the coorbit space @xmath38 .",
    "these data are assumed to satisfy several assumptions that are made both for the target space @xmath1 and for the model space @xmath30 .",
    "assumption  [ h1 ] asks that the kernel @xmath39 is in @xmath1 , which substitutes the classical integrability condition @xmath40 , and that @xmath41 whenever @xmath42 .",
    "this second requirement has a twin version for @xmath30 , namely assumption  [ h5 ] , and it is trivially satisfied in the case @xmath43 because @xmath39 is bounded .",
    "assumption  [ h2 ] and assumption  [ h6 ] ask that the product of any voice transform and any `` good '' function in @xmath44 ( or in @xmath45 ) is in @xmath15 .",
    "assumption  [ h3 ] ensures that the extended voice transform is injective .",
    "this is a necessary condition to reconstruct a distribution from its voice transform .",
    "finally , assumption  [ h4 ] requires that the reproducing formula extends to all distributions .",
    "in particular , we prove in proposition  [ repr - formula ] that assumption  [ h4 ] holds true if @xmath1 is reflexive and @xmath46 .",
    "our theory is succesful in the sense that : it provides a workable substitute for the classical integrability condition @xmath40 ; it contains the classical coorbit space theory even for non irreducible representations ; it applies to several interesting examples ; it is consistent with the recent theory developed in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we recall some properties of the frchet spaces that are relevant to the main objects of our theory , namely the _ target space _ @xmath18 and the space @xmath16 of _ test signals _ that will be defined in the next section . we introduce abstract spaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the space @xmath47 must be interpreted as modeling a subspace of the hilbert space @xmath6 , hence of signals , but possibly with a different topology .",
    "its properties will be used primarily for the test space @xmath16 , but also for  @xmath6 itself .",
    "similarly , the space @xmath48 should be thought of as an abstract model of a frchet space of functions on the group .",
    "the results proved for @xmath48 will be primarily applied to the target space @xmath18 , which in many examples is a genuine frchet space but not a banach space , but will also be useful for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and , most notably , for @xmath51 , the space of functions used to define coorbit spaces . from this point of view",
    ", our theory indicates that it is possible to develop a useful coorbit space theory assuming that @xmath30 is a frchet space rather than the more common choice of a banach space .",
    "this further extension , however , is beyond the scope of this article , and we content ourselves with the classical case in which @xmath30 is banach space .",
    "we now introduce the basic notation and recall some elementary properties .",
    "further technical results are recalled in section  [ notation ] .    throughout this paper , @xmath0 ,",

    "we recall the main properties of the representations acting on frchet spaces . for general background on representations",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .    for all @xmath67",

    "we stress that @xmath5 is not assumed to be irreducible , nor , at this stage , reproducing .",
    "as it is customary , the _ voice transform _ associated to the these data is the map @xmath79 it intertwines @xmath5 and @xmath80 , that is @xmath81 for all @xmath66 .",

    "in particular , we introduce the subspace @xmath93 of those functions which are left fixed by the convolution operator . in the theory of reproducing representations , @xmath90 is the hilbert space @xmath94 ; in the theory developed by h. feichtinger and k. grchenig it is a weighted version of @xmath15 ; in our setting it is the target space  @xmath1 .",
