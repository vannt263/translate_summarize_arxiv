    "the large @xmath3-limit of qcd  @xcite makes quark - hadron duality manifest at the expense of introducing an infinite number of weakly interacting stable mesons and glueballs . while the corresponding counting rules are deduced at the quark - gluon level , internal consistency requires them to be valid also at the hadron level .",
    "moreover , large @xmath3 studies might clarify several features of the nuclear force , in particular , the role played by the ubiquitous scalar meson .",
    "this is an essential ingredient which contributes to the mid range nuclear attraction , which , with a mass of @xmath4 mev , was originally proposed in the fifties  @xcite to provide saturation and binding in nuclei . during many years",
    ", there has been some arbitrariness on the `` effective '' scalar meson mass and coupling constant to the nucleon , partly stimulated by lack of other sources of information .",
    "for instance , in the very successful nucleon  nucleon charge dependent bonn potential  @xcite any partial wave @xmath5-channel is fitted with noticeably different scalar meson masses and couplings .",
    "the situation has steadily changed during the last decade , and the scalar meson has been finally resurrected  @xcite , culminating with the inclusion of the @xmath6 resonance in the pdg  @xcite as the @xmath7 resonance , also denoted as the @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1-resonance is traditionally seen in @xmath8 scattering , with a wide spread of values being displayed ranging from @xmath9 mev for the mass and a @xmath10 mev for the width  @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties have recently been sharpened by a benchmark prediction based on roy equations and chiral symmetry  @xcite yielding the unprecedented accurate values @xmath11 forward dispersion relations and roy equations on the real axis have also been used by the madrid group in ref .",

    "lattice determinations of the lightest scalar mesons are challenging ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been found that the mass of the lightest @xmath6 meson is suppressed relative to the mass of the @xmath6 glueball in quenched qcd at an equivalent lattice spacing  @xcite . in the quenched approximation",
    "it has been claimed  @xcite , that @xmath12 for pion masses as low as @xmath13 . on the other hand , a recent analysis of @xmath14 scattering in the @xmath15 channel yields @xmath16  @xcite , when uncorrelated @xmath17 exchange is disregarded ( see however refs .",

    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) for @xmath8 scattering has been introduced in refs .",

    "most of the results will be obtained in the limit of massless pions , which will allow us to work with almost analytical equations , hence simplifying and enlightening the discussion .",

    "poles of the unitarized amplitudes in unphysical sheets provide masses and widths of the resonances , and the change of the position of these poles determines their properties for growing @xmath3 . to carry out such a program requires extending the chiral amplitudes for an arbitrary number of colours .",
    "this is a delicate point because in any case one must insure that _ all _ possible leading @xmath3 dependences should be contained in this unphysical @xmath19 extrapolation . in our study",
    "all qcd @xmath3 dependence appears through the low energy constants ( lec s ) , which leading @xmath3 behaviour could be obtained within the resonance saturation approach  @xcite .",
    "we will further simplify the problem and we will work within the single resonance approximation ( sra ) scheme , where each infinite resonance sum is just approximated with the contribution from the lowest - lying meson nonet with the given quantum numbers .",
    "we will see how a rather natural requirement of consistency between resonance saturation and unitarization imposes useful constraints in the extreme @xmath20 limit .",

    "one of the major , but crucial , differences of the present work with these other two is the use of the sra to estimate the leading @xmath3 behaviour of the lec s .",
    "though in the vicinity of @xmath21 we find similar results , we will show that the requirement of consistency between resonance saturation and unitarization , for very large values of @xmath3 , imposes useful constraints .",

    "moreover , at a scale of about 770 mev , the contribution of the logs is comparable in size to that of the renormalized lec s @xmath54 , being thus the @xmath52channel dynamics strongly influenced by these logarithms stemming from the chiral loops .",

    "one  loop iam consistency requirement now leads to @xmath211 which constitutes one of the main results of this work .",
    "the situation , however , is totally different in the scalar sector . from the estimates given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eles - sra ] ) , we find that the combination @xmath212 turns out to be small compared to the log contribution and negative .",
    "thus , for @xmath3 sufficient large",
    "the @xmath52pole disappears from the fourth quadrant of the srs , and one finds a similar behaviour to that depicted in fig .  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "this might hint at a definite non @xmath127 nature of the @xmath52resonance , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , since there is no trace even of the existence of a sub - dominant @xmath127 component .",
    "finite pion mass corrections can be easily taken into account , but they do not modify the discussion .",

    "let us assume that @xmath219 is positive , leading then to a stable @xmath52resonance in the @xmath126 limit .",

    "( [ eq : mvs ] ) ( or  ( [ eq : mvs2 ] ) ) based only in the vector channel .",
    "there are different ways to circumvent this apparent contradiction : not identifying @xmath220 and assuming that , in the large @xmath3 limit , the @xmath1 meson becomes heavier than the scalar meson nonet , invoked in the sra , or correcting the sra estimates of the lec s by considering , for instance , contributions of tensor resonances  @xcite , etc .... nevertheless , one should bear in mind that for this large value of the mass ( @xmath224 ) , iam results , based on the first two orders of the chiral expansion , should not be very reliable because of the limited control on the leading @xmath3 terms appearing beyond @xmath225 .",
    "we have started looking at the chiral limit of the one loop su(2 ) chpt amplitudes . we have shown how in the chiral limit , a major source of distinction between the @xmath52 and @xmath2 channels is due to the role played by chiral logarithms ; while for the @xmath52channel the logs add up into sizeable contributions , in the @xmath2channel they cancel exactly .",
    "next , we have used the iam to unitarize the amplitudes and have looked for poles in the srs of the amplitudes .",
    "we have found a fair description of the established properties of the @xmath52 and @xmath2resonances , showing the little effect of finite pion mass and coupled channel corrections .",
    "the properties of these resonances for growing number of colors have been also discussed .",
    "our results confirm and explain the different behavior , in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 for @xmath3 not far from 3 , but , when extending the analysis to the large @xmath3 limit , no robust conclusion of the @xmath1 pole behavior can be inferred from the one loop iam only .",
    "this is due to the large cancellation existing in the combination of lec s that govern the scalar channel ; there exists a critical value for a combination of lec s which can not be pinned down with the needed accuracy at _ any _ value of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we have discussed further constraints deduced by requiring consistency between resonance saturation and unitarization . by looking only at the @xmath2channel , we have found that the masses of the first vector and scalar meson nonets , invoked in the sra , turn out to be degenerated in the large @xmath3 limit ( see eq .",

    "@xcite supports this latter result . if we look at the right top panel of fig . 1 of this reference",
    ", we observe that above the @xmath226 region , the @xmath52mass becomes rather constant , while its width rapidly decreases .",
    "moreover , this large @xmath3 asymptotic value of the mass is around two or three times bigger than latexmath:[${\\rm re}\\ \\sqrt{s_\\sigma}\\big      within the restricted iam unitarization approach assumed here , we would find a scenario where the @xmath1 resonance would become degenerate with the @xmath0 and stable , for a sufficiently large number of colors .",
    "this complies to the consequences of mended symmetries  @xcite as well as with chiral quark model calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the @xmath52resonance in the real world ( @xmath21 ) would be totally different to that of the @xmath2meson , being it mostly governed by chiral logarithms stemming from unitarity and crossing symmetry , justifying the widely accepted nature of the @xmath1 as a dynamically generated meson .",
