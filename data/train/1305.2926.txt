    "the nature of the large , spatially extended regions of luminous line emission found around many types of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at both low and high redshifts ( e.g. , radio galaxies , quasars and seyferts ) have been studied for over three decades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "their rarity and association with large amounts of warm , ionized gas suggests a link with massive galaxy assembly , with the ly@xmath3  either tracing the giant gas reservoir from which the galaxy is being formed , or the gas that has been expelled by the subsequent superwind from a starburst or agn .",

    "while these predictions are consistent with some of the main blob phenomenology such as their luminosity ( function ) and morphologies , these models are difficult to test empirically in the presence of heavy star - formation , dust , outflows , merging , or agn . also , some labs show relatively high metallicities or metallicity gradients , indicating that at least the central gas has already been enriched @xcite .         in the ly@xmath3  halos associated with radio galaxies , the ly@xmath3  line emission is predominantly powered by photo - ionization from an agn , often with a smaller contribution from shock waves associated with radio jets ( e.g. * ?",
    "the main arguments in favor of agn photoionization are the biconical morphologies of the emission line gas observed in some sources , the energetics and line ratios of the extended emission , and the presence of emission line gas well beyond the radio structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the census of narrow - band selected labs presented in the top part of table [ tab : census ] can be considered a complete sample for luminosities of @xmath145 erg s@xmath1 .",

    "* ) with properties that are , on average , very similar to those of the labs , it is not yet clear whether the same is true for their radio - quiet counterparts due to the relatively small sample sizes @xcite .",
    "the detailed comparison between the qsos and other classes of sources with extended ly@xmath3nebulae ( e.g. hzrgs and labs ) is particularly difficult because of sample selection , geometric effects , obscuration , and because in qsos the line - of - sight is dominated by luminous ly@xmath3  emission from the agn broad line region .",
    "therefore , the qsos listed in the third part of table [ tab : census ] do not form a complete sample , but they were specifically chosen to illustrate that the basic properties of extended ly@xmath3  nebulae are comparable among the labs , hzrgs , and ( at least some ) qsos .",
    "if we look at the evidence presented in table [ tab : census ] , at least 63% ( 81% when including tentative agn ) of luminous labs are associated with luminous agn .",
    "these numbers are lower limits because not all labs have been observed at similar depths or wavelengths .",
    "the agn fraction is thus very high , especially since the agn duty cycles ( the time spent by a black hole in the ` active ' state ) are believed to be relatively short ( 10 - 100 myr ) .",
    "this must mean that ly@xmath3  surveys always tend to find those objects that are in the active state , and therefore are providing a plentiful supply of ionizing photons to their surrounding gaseous medium . also , because the agn duty cycles are short ( compared to a galaxy building time scale ) , the labs that are visible at any given epoch probably represent a larger population of gaseous halos that are not being actively illuminated , at least not to an extent that would give rise to similar luminosities and sizes as those of the labs listed in table [ tab : census ] .",
    "both the hzrgs and the radio - quiet labs have been associated with overdense regions in the high redshift large - scale structure @xcite , leading to a popular hypothesis that the lab phenomenon is perhaps linked to ly@xmath3  cooling radiation in massive dark matter halos as predicted by theory .",
    "however , our census of the most luminous labs presented above appears to indicate that the primary correlation is that between ( luminous ) labs and agn .",
    "@xcite reached a very similar conclusion based on deep x - ray observations of the ssa22 field targeting a great number of extended laes discovered by @xcite .",
    "they derived an agn fraction of at least 17% , but this is considered a strict lower limit as the sample is dominated by sources down to @xmath146 erg s@xmath1 that are x - ray faint .",
    "in fact , if indirect evidence for agn based on ir emission is included , the agn fraction within the ssa22 field is @xmath1630% , and if a higher luminosity cut is placed on ly@xmath3  to match the selection of @xcite , the agn fraction is @xmath1650% .",
    "as we have shown , if we increase our ly@xmath3  luminosity threshold even further , the agn fraction among all luminous labs found in the literature approaches 100% .",
    "this is consistent with the recent study of @xcite , who studied a population of rare , dusty objects having high ir luminosities and warm ir colors suggestive of intense agn activity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "90% show ly@xmath3  in emission , with 37% showing ly@xmath3(luminosities @xmath147 erg s@xmath1 ) extended over @xmath10130 kpc , i.e. comparable to the lab selection criteria of @xcite .",
    "if , as we suggest , the primary correlation is between labs and agn , then the correlation between labs and environment could be a secondary one between environment and agn .",
    "the fact that excesses of labs are primarily found in overdense regions would then simply be due to the fact that overdense regions are overdense in massive galaxies that are more frequently associated with agn ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the extra source of ionizing photons provided by these agn will further boost the correlation for the most luminous labs , even if some labs can be powered by ionizing radiation from star - formation alone .",
    "a correlation between labs and environment is also expected in the cold streams models of @xcite . in these models , the most luminous ly@xmath3  halos",
    "are always associated with cooling radiation from the most massive halos , for which other simulations typically predict that they are host to massive galaxies ( and possibly agn ) .",
    "there is one important difference though .",
    "the cosmological cold streams have a duty cycle of @xmath831 , much longer than that of the agn .",
    "therefore , if the labs were powered by gravitational heating ( and subsequent cooling ) , then we would expect a ( significant ) fraction of the labs to be associated with massive halos in which the black hole is inactive .",
    "the fact that we find an extremely high fraction of agn , strongly suggests that the agn is the main driver of the ly@xmath3luminosity in these labs . even in the cases where no agn or extensive star formation is observed , ly@xmath3",
    "cooling radiation is not the only alternative explanation . in the nearby universe , examples of massive extended clouds with agn - photoionized line - ratios have been found around galaxies in which the agn has apparently switched off on short time - scales @xcite , illustrating that episodic agn activity may need to be considered as well when interpreting high redshift labs .",
    "irrespective of what is powering the ly@xmath3  emission , the photons must be coming from relative cold gas ( @xmath148 k ) .",
    "given that the labs are probably associated with massive halos with @xmath149 k , it is not clear what is the source of the spatially extended cold gas .",
    "it is still possible that the cold gas originates from within the streams .",
    "@xcite computed that the spectrum of ` gravitionally heated ' cold streams should be double peaked and mostly centered on the systemic velocity .",
    "this is different from what is observed in b1 .",
    "@xcite found that the ly@xmath3  emission of b1 has an observed width of @xmath16600 km s@xmath1 , and is redshifted by 490 km s@xmath1 with respect to .",
    "this is similar to the typical offset between ly@xmath3  and interstellar absorption features ( like ) seen in lyman break galaxies @xcite .",
    "the redshifted ly@xmath3emission  is also seen in absorption along the line of sight of a background qso at an impact parameter of 180 kpc .",
    "the absorption is unusually broad ( @xmath150 km s@xmath1 ) , and its line center coincides with that of . ]",
    "suggests that the photons scatter through cold gas in some large - scale outflow ( as in e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these outflows can explain the level of enrichment of the gas , which may be difficult to maintain if strong cold flows were active .",
    "it is interesting to note that our analysis of the optical emission lines showed that although the gas is highly turbulent ( velocity dispersions of 800 - 1000 km s@xmath1 ) , it does not have any apparent large velocity shear .",
    "this may hold some clues to the process of agn feedback .",
    "the lack of velocity shears may indicate that radiative - mode feedback from the agn is not capable of inducing large - scale radial flows .",
    "labs might thus offer good test beds for our ideas about radiative mode agn feedback and its impact on massive galaxy formation .",
    "if the luminous lab phenomenon is associated with powerful agn , we would naively expect that the population of labs should extend toward much lower redshifts than currently probed by ly@xmath3  studies , possibly closely following the evolution in the quasar luminosity function .",
    "in contrast , @xcite have suggested that labs may be specific to the high redshift universe , based on their absence in galaxy clusters at @xmath151 .",
    "their study was motivated by the empirical relation between labs and overdense environments at @xmath152",
    ". however , the highly active and gas - rich environments typical of overdense environments at @xmath152 ( `` protoclusters '' ) are far from equivalent to the cores of massive , virialized clusters at @xmath153 that are dominated by large amounts of hot gas .",
    "instead , we propose that luminous labs at low redshift may still be found in the more typical , lower density , and gas - rich environments of actively accreting galaxies and agn .",
    "evidence for this exists in the form of extended ionized nebulae ( @xmath101 few tens of kpc in some cases ) around @xmath153 radio galaxies and quasars ( both radio loud and radio quiet ) .",
    "although we do not have observations of their ly@xmath3 , it is expected that they also have extended ly@xmath3  nebulae , possibly more extended than  or h@xmath3  given that it is an intrinsically stronger line ( unless heavily absorbed ) .",
    "it is also possible that the most luminous and extended labs are only found in the high redshift regime when the cosmological accretion rates of cold gas were highest , providing the source of the gas that is being ionized by the agn .",
    "@xcite showed that the total luminosities ( and sizes ) of the ly@xmath3  halos around hzrgs strongly decline with decreasing redshift , which does not match any change in the total energy output by the agn as inferred from their radio or x - ray luminosities .",
    "the evolution of their ly@xmath3  halos thus appears to be probing a real evolutionary effect perhaps related to the reservoir of gas from which the massive galaxies are forming .",
    "this indicates that labs could still play an important role in the study of cosmological gas accretion modes , although perhaps in a more indirect manner than typically proposed .",
    "we have used the sinfoni integral field spectrograph to resolve the dominant rest - frame optical emission lines of the luminous ( @xmath154 erg s@xmath1 ) ly@xmath3  blob ` b1 ' at @xmath12 discovered by @xcite .",
    "our main findings and conclusions are as follows .",
    "@xmath155 we detect luminous @xmath4  and h@xmath3  emission with a spatial extent of at least @xmath5 kpc ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the dominant optical emission line component ( b1 north ) shows relatively broad lines ( 600800 km s@xmath1 , fwhm ) and agn - photoionized line - ratios in an optical line diagnostic diagram of /h@xmath33  versus /h@xmath3 .",
    "a secondary component ( b1 south ) of much more modest velocities of @xmath9 km s@xmath1 ( fwhm ) roughly coincides with a filament of faint ly@xmath3  and uv continuum detected previously @xcite .",
    "@xmath155 the extinction - corrected @xmath295007 luminosity in b1 is about 1@xmath156 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "this is high compared to that of typical laes , but consistent with that of hzrgs @xcite and quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at that redshift .",
    "the high luminosity , combined with the evidence for agn photo - ionization , suggests that b1 north is the site of a hidden quasar .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that  is relatively weak compared to  ( extinction - corrected /  of about 3.8 ) , which is indicative of a high , seyfert - like ionization parameter .",
    "this is consistent with the previous detection of a narrow @xmath291549  line , as well as with the high mid - ir luminosity found by @xcite .",
    "although the  emission was originally interpreted as evidence of an agn @xcite , more recently it was hypothesized that the  and ly@xmath3  emission could arise from a great number of merging halos and shocked gas clouds @xcite . in light of the new evidence ,",
    "we adopt the former interpretation , and conclude that the b1 emission line nebula is the narrow line region of an obscured quasar .",
    "@xmath155 based on established relations between @xmath157}$ ]  and @xmath158 for type ii agn @xcite we conclude that b1 north hosts an extremely luminous quasar with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the obscured agn may be compton - thick given existing x - ray limits .",
    "@xmath155 we have performed a census of the most luminous labs selected from the literature , and find that virtually all luminous labs ( @xmath136 erg s@xmath1 ) harbor obscured quasars .",
    "the properties of labs in general are furthermore remarkably similar to those of hzrgs and quasars .",
    "@xmath155 we find that the agn scenario is easily capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to power the ly@xmath3luminosities observed .",
    "@xmath155 the fact that the duty cycle of agn is relatively short compared to that of cosmological gas accretion as predicted by models , implies that agn are the main driver of the ly@xmath3  luminosity in the most luminous labs , even if the large - scale cosmological gas flows are providing the material .",
    "@xmath155 our findings also imply that the empirical relation between labs and overdense environments at high redshift suggested by the literature , is primarily due to a more fundamental correlation between agn ( or massive galaxies ) and environment .",

    "<S> the new evidence for agn photo - ionization , combined with previously detected  and luminous , warm infrared emission , suggest that b1 is the site of a hidden quasar . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by the fact that  is relatively weak compared to  ( extinction - corrected /  of about 3.8 ) , which is indicative of a high , seyfert - like ionization parameter . from the extinction - corrected  luminosity we infer a bolometric agn luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath1 , and further conclude that the obscured agn may be compton - thick given existing x - ray limits . </S>",
    "<S> the large line widths observed are consistent with clouds moving within the narrow line region of a luminous qso . </S>",
    "<S> the agn scenario is capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to power the ly@xmath3 , even in the presence of dust . by performing a census of similar objects in the literature </S>",
    "<S> , we find that virtually all luminous labs harbor obscured quasars . </S>",
    "<S> based on simple duty - cycle arguments , we conclude that agn are the main drivers of the ly@xmath3  in labs rather than the gravitational heating and subsequent cooling suggested by cold stream models . </S>",
    "<S> we also conclude that the empirical relation between labs and overdense environments at high redshift must be due to a more fundamental correlation between agn ( or massive galaxies ) and environment . </S>"
