    "neutron stars are natural laboratories for studying the extreme physical conditions that support the existence of ultra - dense degenerate nuclear matter , which is held together by its own strong gravity .",
    "comprehending the structure and composition of these compact stars is challenging .",
    "although , a complete understanding of the neutron star interior is yet to emerge , several equations of state have been proposed to describe it .",
    "the core of this compact star is made of hadronic matter and the interaction of such a many - body system is governed by the laws of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "matter under such conditions is expected to be described by an experimentally unexplored and a completely different regime of the qcd phase diagram than the one , e.g. , of hot dense matter such as the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this is because the former has a very high chemical potential and supra - nuclear density , along with a very low temperature compared to the fermi temperature , @xmath1 .",
    "deriving the properties of this phase from any first principle calculations , such as in lattice gauge theory , is currently not a viable proposition .",
    "the strong self - gravitational field of a neutron star harbors extreme physical conditions that can create a unique fundamental phase of hadronic matter .",
    "this dense degenerate nuclear matter can not be created in any terrestrial laboratory , e.g. , rhic , cern , or any other particle collider where the center - of - mass energy is significantly higher than @xmath1 at a comparable density .",
    "it has been speculated for a long time that the condition in the neutron star interior may be suitable enough to support bose - einstein condensates of different types of nuclear matter , such as pions , kaons or even neutrons , without necessarily involving any exotic particles , e.g. , certain flavors of quarks .",
    "sawyer @xcite , barshay et al .",
    "@xcite and baym @xcite were among the first to propose that super - dense nuclear matter in the interior of a neutron star can undergo phase transition to produce @xmath2 condensation .",
    "glendenning et al .",
    "@xcite formulated the theoretical background of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter with both normal and pion condensed states in neutron stars and derived a few candidate equations of state , some of which can produce a @xmath3 m@xmath4 star .",
    "recently a couple of massive neutron stars , with masses of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , were discovered by antoniadis et al .",
    "@xcite and demorest et al .",
    "@xcite , respectively , which triggered multiple papers proposing various models of cold , dense , degenerate nuclear matter that can support stable configurations of self - gravitating fluid with those observed large mass values @xcite . specifically , superconductivity and superfluidity have been hypothesized in the past to exist in neutron stars to explain certain observational effects ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "neutrons bound in cooper pairs can form a bec .",
    "each pair can be treated as a composite boson with an effective mass nearly equal to twice the mass of a neutron , or less , depending on how large the binding energy is . a microscopically exact way of treating such a system is provided by the theory of bcs - bec crossover , which describes a transition from the quantum state of superfluidity ( bcs phase ) to a bec . nishida and abuki @xcite explained the basic concept of this crossover and showed that these two states are smoothly connected without a phase transition .",
    "just as with masses , several observational measurements exist of the radii of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "although simultaneous measurements of both the mass and the radius of the same object are available for a few cases @xcite , more reliable and tighter constraints come from a collection of different methods applied to various sources .",
    "this makes it possible to seek consistency among all those astronomical observations for any particular equation of state .",
    "what has been possible is to obtain constraints on it by examining the distributions of the measured masses and radii of various sources ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "therefore , whenever new observations are made , such as with the aforementioned two heaviest neutron stars , it is important to revisit how those constraints get revised and what equations of state get ruled out or in .",
    "note that no radius measurements are available for these ( heaviest ) neutron stars till date .    in this paper",
    ", we study the structural properties of neutron stars , particularly , mass ( @xmath7 ) , radius ( @xmath8 ) and spin , formed from a bec of neutron cooper pairs , the equation of state ( eos ) for which was first introduced by colpi , shapiro , wasserman ( csw ) @xcite .",
    "chavanis and harko @xcite hypothesized that the recently observed massive neutron stars  @xcite are bec stars obeying the csw eos .",
    "this proposal was based on their demonstration that the csw eos , when applied to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations of relativistic stellar structure , allows for the observed large neutron star masses .",
    "this in turn is facilitated by a range of values that the scattering length and the mass of the cooper pair of neutrons can assume , both of which are free parameters in their model for the eos . in the literature , however , the csw eos has been adopted for studying not just the possibility of becs as the constituents of stellar mass compact objects but also the viability of equilibrium configurations of boson stars @xcite .",
    "indeed , boson stars have been considered as possible dark matter candidates @xcite . in the cosmological context",
    ", boson stars have been proposed to have a range of masses , including those comparable to supermassive black hole masses ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", various people have studied observational consequences of the existence of boson stars , such as through electromagnetic observations @xcite and gravitational waves ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "therefore , if the aforementioned hypothesis of chavanis and harko is indeed true , then it can have important implications for these proposed observations .    with this in mind",
    ", here we revisit the theoretically allowed equilibrium configurations of boson stars , specifically , to test the predictions of chavanis and harko against astronomical observations of the masses and radii of neutron stars .",
    "we build on their work by generalizing it to include spin , with different scattering lengths and cooper - pair masses , to compute the observationally verifiable mass - radius relations .",
    "as shown in the subsequent sections , unfortunately for this model , we find that the radius predicted by the csw eos is too large to be consistent with astronomical observations .",
    "in ref . @xcite chavanis and harko proposed that in the neutron star interior a bec can exist in the form of neutron cooper - pairs .",
    "they argued that this bec can be described by the csw eos : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pressure of the fluid , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the total energy - density of the fluid , @xmath13 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath14 above , @xmath15 is the mass of the neutron cooper - pair , @xmath16 is the planck constant , and @xmath17 is a dimensionless quantity defined by @xmath18 above , @xmath19 is the scattering length that defines a @xmath20 interaction between condensed bosons and , via the relativistic gross - pitaeviskii equation , gives rise to the eos defined in eq .",
    "( [ csw_eos ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath15 is a free parameter .",
    "it obeys @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the neutron mass .",
    "@xmath17 is the second free parameter in their model . as is evident in eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) , both @xmath19 and @xmath15 enter the eos through the single parameter @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , a stable equilibrium stationary stellar configuration of a self - gravitating condensate corresponding to a specific value of @xmath23 can actually arise from multiple possible values of @xmath19 and @xmath15 .",
    "below , we use the values of stellar structural quantities , such as mass , radius , and spin , as obtained from astronomical observations of neutron stars to constrain the free parameter @xmath23 and , hence , the allowed values of both scattering length @xmath19 and cooper - pair mass @xmath15 .    in this paper",
    "we consider stationary axisymmetric equilibrium configurations of the star with four different stellar spin frequencies , as well as the static spherically symmetric non - spinning case , with perfect fluid matter .",
    "we used the publicly available `` rapidly rotating neutron star '' ( rns ) code @xcite ( which follows the algorithm defined in komatsu et al . @xcite and cook et al .",
    "@xcite ) to numerically obtain these configurations for stellar spin frequencies 250 hz , 500 hz , 750 hz , and 1 khz , as well as the non - spinning one for the csw equation of state .",
    "( see appendix [ app : rns ] for a brief description of the rns code . )    for each value of the stellar spin frequency chosen here , we computed the gravitational mass @xmath7 ( generally referred to as `` mass '' in this paper , unless mentioned otherwise ) and the stellar radius @xmath8 , both equatorial and polar , corresponding to a hundred different values of the central density of the star .",
    "the results are given in sec .",
    "[ effect_eos_ns - structure ] .",
    "the value of the eos parameter @xmath23 neither is known from any calculations from first principles nor has been determined yet from any experimental data and , therefore , remains a free parameter .",
    "any change in @xmath23 will change the eos ( see eqs .",
    "( [ csw_eos])-([lambda ] ) ) and , thus , will also affect the observable structural quantities . here",
    ", we discuss the effect of that parameter on the maximum gravitational mass of such a neutron star .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we study the static spherically symmetric ( non - spinning ) as well as the stationary axisymmetric spinning equilibrium configurations of a star . in the latter case",
    "we derive configurations for four different stellar spin frequencies .",
    "we make the following three assumptions : ( i ) the star resides in an asymptotically flat spacetime ; ( ii ) the spacetime has a timelike killing vector @xmath24 and an azimuthal ( rotational ) killing vector @xmath25 ; ( iii ) the two killing vectors commute and there exists a transformation , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , under which the spacetime is isometric . under these reasonable assumptions",
    "the background metric @xmath28 of a star turns out to be @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are metric functions that depend only on the coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , we assume the matter of the star to be a perfect fluid , which is described by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath36 where @xmath12 is the energy density , @xmath37 is the pressure and @xmath38 is the four - velocity of a fluid element .",
    "the relativistic euler equation for this stationary axisymmetric star is given by @xmath39 we used the publicly available rns - code @xcite which follows the algorithm of cook et al .",
    "@xcite , with some minor modifications , to numerically compute the solutions of the above equation for the csw equation of state and for stellar spin frequencies 250 hz ( shown by red curves in figs . [ k - parameter_mass - radius_plot1 ] and [ k - parameter_mass - radius_plot2 ] ) , 500 hz ( green curves ) , 750 hz ( blue curves ) and 1 khz ( pink curves ) along with the non - spinning ( black curves )",
    ". the rns code can compute individual stellar models as well as sequences of them for fixed mass , rest mass , angular velocity or angular momentum .",
    "the code uses uniform rotation in all models with spin , which is a very good approximation for the compact configurations studied here .",
