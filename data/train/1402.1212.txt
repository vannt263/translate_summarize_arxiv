    "fully hydrogenating graphene generates a chemically new two - dimensional material , named _ graphane _ , which has @xmath0 covalent bonds between adjacent carbon atoms , as opposed to the @xmath1 bonds of graphene .",
    "@xcite the hydrogenation opens the band gap , making graphane interesting for carbon - based nanoelectronics.@xcite intensive research effort has been devoted to graphane , since it was first theoretically predicted in 2007  @xcite and experimentally realized in 2009@xcite .",
    "previous research of graphane , mainly focusing on electronic related aspects , leads to many exciting findings@xcite .",
    "however , as the size of electronic devices decreases to nanoscale , power density grows exponentially in integrated circuits ,  @xcite while , thermal conduction gets strongly suppressed due to increased numbers of boundaries and interfaces , and heat dissipation becomes serious in nanoelectronics .",
    "therefore , more knowledge and understanding on thermal conduction behaviors are urgently demanded .",
    "the study of thermal conduction in graphane is important not only to practical applications but also to fundamental research .",
    "it is well known that graphene belongs to one of the best thermal conductors in nature .",
    "@xcite the change in bonding configuration from @xmath1 to @xmath0 can result in distinctly different lattice dynamics .",
    "moreover , hydrogens of graphane prevalently desorb at finite temperatures , resulting in hydrogen vacancies that introduce phonon scattering .",
    "importantly , concentration of hydrogen vacancy can be reversibly controlled in experiments , for instance , by varying temperature and hydrogen pressure@xcite .",
    "this degree of freedom of hydrogen vacancy can be used to tune thermal conduction .    in this work",
    ", we use the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method to study thermal conduction in graphane , choosing graphane nanoribbons ( ganrs ) as transport systems .",
    "we demonstrate that thermal conduction can be effectively tuned by controlling the width , edge shape and hydrogen vacancy concentration of ganrs .",
    "specifically , ballistic thermal conductance @xmath2 of ganrs generally grows with the ribbon width .",
    "the scaled quantity , ballistic thermal conductance per area ( @xmath3 ) , displays an interesting dependence on edge shape , with zigzag nanoribbons having room - temperature @xmath3 up to 60% larger than armchair nanoribbons .",
    "similar behaviors have been found in graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) .",
    "@xcite differently , ganrs have obviously lower @xmath3 and larger thermal conductance anisotropy than their graphene counterparts .",
    "furthermore , the inclusion of hydrogen vacancies significantly enhances the thermal conductance anisotropy , and varies thermal conductance in wide ranges",
    ". the tunable thermal conduction may find applications in thermal management and thermoelectrics .",
    "thermal conduction is contributed by electrons and lattice vibrations in graphane .",
    "the electronic part will be neglected considering the semiconducting nature of graphane .",
    "such an approximation works well even for the gapless system graphene , in which lattice vibrations dominate thermal conduction  @xcite .",
    "the negf method@xcite , as an approach fully based on quantum mechanics and widely used to deal with many - body problems , is applied to simulate thermal conduction ( i.e. , phonon transport herein ) .",
    "the complex many - body interactions , including phonon - phonon and electron - phonon interactions , would be important only at high temperatures and will not be discussed here .",
    "this allows us to focus on discussing ballistic thermal conductance and impurity scattering , for which the negf method gives exact results .    here",
    "the empirical brenner potential @xcite as implemented in  general utility lattice program\"@xcite was used to relax lattice geometry and compute force constants .",
    "the optimized bond lengths of c - c and c - h of graphane are 1.54  and 1.09  , respectively , in good agreement with first - principles results@xcite .",
    "moreover , brenner potential is reliable for phonon calculations of carbon systems , as checked also by first - principles calculations@xcite . using the obtained force constants as input , the negf method gives phonon transmission function @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the phonon frequency ) for a given transport system , as described in detail in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "then thermal conductance as a function of temperature is calculated by the landauer formula @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath8 with @xmath9 the reduced planck constant , @xmath10.@xcite to compare thermal conduction ability between systems of different cross sectional area ( @xmath11 ) , we introduced a scaled quantity , thermal conductance per area ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "for ganrs , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ribbon width and @xmath15 is the effective thickness , selected to be 0.48 nm , same as the interlayer separation of graphane multilayers@xcite .",
    "hydrogen vacancy induced phonon scattering was previously studied using the cascade scattering model@xcite by neglecting multiple scattering induced interference effects : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of hydrogen vacancies , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the phonon transmission in the presence of @xmath17 , 1 and 0 scatterers , respectively .",
    "the model applies to systems with low concentration of scatterers , according to previous work  @xcite and our tests .",
    "all inequivalent positions of single hydrogen vacancy were considered .",
    "the corresponding phonon transmissions , showing negligible differences between each other , were averaged to give @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the ballistic phonon transmission function .",
    "once @xmath19 and @xmath20 were calculated by the negf method , thermal conductance as a function of @xmath17 was given by the cascade scattering model .",
    "we choose ganrs as transport systems , because they are building blocks of nanoelectronic devices and they are quasi - one dimensional , suitable for transport study . in experiments , ganrs can be formed by hydrogenation of gnrs , by unzipping graphane nanotubes@xcite or by directly cutting a graphane sheet.@xcite we consider ganrs of different edge shapes , including armchair ganrs ( aganrs ) and zigzag ganrs ( zganrs ) . in an ideally truncated ganr",
    ", each edge carbon atom has a dangling bond .",
    "we study cases without and with hydrogen saturation at edges , with the latter case denoted by an additional label `` -h '' , as depicted in fig",
    ", along the longitude direction , is denoted by the red arrow . ]",
    "thermal conductivity @xmath21 in diffusive region is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the phonon mean free path for backscattering .",
    "@xcite the information of @xmath3 helps us to evaluate the ability of a material as a ballistic thermal conductor and also to estimate @xmath23 if @xmath21 is known from experiment .",
    "figure 2 presents the room - temperature @xmath3 for ganrs of varying widths and edges .",
    "@xmath3 depends significantly on the width for narrow ganrs , and shows a weak width dependence for wide ganrs when @xmath24 nm .",
    "importantly , @xmath3 of zigzag nanoribbons is obviously larger than that of armchair nanoribbons , showing anisotropic thermal conduction .",
    "we define an anisotropy factor @xmath25 , where the subscripts `` @xmath26 '' and `` @xmath27 '' denote zigzag and armchair edges , respectively . at room temperature ,",
    "@xmath28 of ganrs is as high as 60% , gets smaller in wider ribbons , but still keeps large ( over 20% ) even for ribbons of @xmath29 nm ( see inset of fig.2 ) .",
    "hydrogenation at edges has minor influence on thermal conductance of zigzag nanoribbons , while noticeably increases thermal conductance of armchair nanoribbons , leading to a slight decrease of @xmath28 .    ) of ganrs with different edges as a function of width ( @xmath14 ) at @xmath30 k.",
    "the inset shows the anisotropy factor @xmath28 of thermal conductance as a function of width ( @xmath14 ) for ganr and ganr - h at @xmath31 k. ]    it is worthwhile to compare ballistic thermal conductance between graphane and graphene systems . at room temperature and for @xmath32 nm",
    ", @xmath3 of zigzag gnr is @xmath33 wm@xmath34k@xmath35 ,  @xcite close to that of graphene sheet  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding value of zganrs is @xmath36 wm@xmath34k@xmath35 , about 40% lower than the graphene counterpart .",
    "when excluding the influence of a larger effective thickness , we still find a decrease of 15% in @xmath37 from graphene to graphane cases .",
    "the decrease of ballistic thermal conductance is presumably because phonon bands of graphene is more dispersive than those of graphane .",
    "this is consistent with previous studies  @xcite , which find reduced phonon group velocity when changing the bonding configuration from @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
    "similar anisotropic thermal conductance is also found in gnrs  @xcite , where the room - temperature @xmath28 is up to 30% , smaller than that of ganrs . considering that thermal conduction is isotropic in a two - dimensional graphane or graphene sheet , the appearance of anisotropy in nanoribbons can be attributed to boundary effects . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "2 , @xmath28 keeps noticeably large even for nanoribbons of tens of nanometers wide , indicating that the boundary effects are very long range .    intuitively phonon structure of the same material would vary if applying different boundary conditions , which contributes to the anisotropy in @xmath3 .",
    "previous work  @xcite argued that in hexagonal lattice structures armchair edges are prone to give more localized phonon modes than zigzag edges , resulting in lower phonon transmission .",
    "the argument applies to present systems , as supported by comparing phonon transmission between zganr and aganr with similar width of 3.4 nm . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , phonon transmission of zganr is obviously higher than that of aganr , especially within the frequency region of 200 - 700 cm@xmath35 .",
    "thermal conductance , as a weighted integration of phonon transmission function , is thus larger in zganr than in aganr .",
    "meanwhile , we notice that phonon transmissions of the two ganrs are essentially the same in the low - frequency region ( below 200 cm@xmath35 ) .",
    "the low - temperature thermal conductance , mainly contributed by low - frequency phonons , should be isotropic . as presented in the inset of fig .",
    "3(b ) , @xmath28 evolves from 0 at low temperatures , gradually increases and finally saturates when increasing temperature to above 200 k.    ) and ( b ) the scaled thermal conductance ( @xmath39 ) versus temperature ( @xmath40 ) for zganr and aganr of width @xmath41 nm .",
    "the inset shows the anisotropy factor @xmath28 as a function of temperature @xmath40 . ]    in graphane , hydrogen vacancies commonly exist and their concentration can be effectively controlled by experimental conditions like temperature and hydrogen pressure.@xcite it would be interesting to see the effect of hydrogen vacancy on thermal conduction . physically each hydrogen vacancy acts as an impurity scatterer for phonon transport .",
    "thermal conductance gets lower with increasing number of hydrogen vacancies ( @xmath17 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "this can change thermal conductance orders of magnitude when @xmath17 is large .",
    "the @xmath17-dependent thermal conductance , if providing a concentration of hydrogen vacancy , naturally gives the length - dependent behavior , which enables extracting phonon mean free path of impurity scattering .",
    "further details will be presented elsewhere .",
    "though hydrogen vacancies decrease thermal conductances of both zganr and aganr , the influence is quantitatively different .",
    "we find that thermal conduction reduction induced by hydrogen vacancy is smaller in zganr than in aganr , leading to enhanced thermal conductance anisotropy . as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , @xmath28 enhances from 40% to 65% when increasing @xmath17 .    ) versus the number of h - vacancy @xmath17 for zganr and aganr of width @xmath41 nm at @xmath30 k. ( b ) the anisotropy factor @xmath28 versus the number of h - vacancy @xmath17 at @xmath30 k. ]    to demonstrate hydrogen vacancy induced scattering in detail , we present phonon - transmission ratios between systems with and without hydrogen vacancies , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . a single hydrogen vacancy does not affect low - frequency acoustic phonons and mainly scatters high - frequency optical phonons , in qualitative agreement with the picture of rayleigh scattering .",
    "as the number of vacancies increases , phonon transmission gets suppressed ( except for phonons of nearly zero frequency ) .",
    "the trend is independent of edge shapes of ganrs .",
    "however , hydrogen vacancy induced suppression of phonon transmission is obviously weaker in zganr than in aganr .",
    "this provides an example that the variance in boundary condition affects the strength of impurity scattering . the difference in scattering strength",
    "is translated to the discrepancy in thermal conductance reduction , which explains the enhancement of thermal conduction anisotropy induced by hydrogen vacancy .",
    "nm with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 h - vacancies . ]",
    "in summary , we show dependencies of thermal conductance on the width , edge shape and hydrogen vacancy concentration of ganrs .",
    "these degrees of freedom allow tuning thermal conduction in graphane systems .",
    "compared to the graphene counterparts , ganrs are expected to have lower thermal conductivity , because their ballistic thermal conductance is lower due to the different bonding configuration , and their phonon mean free path in ganrs is shorter caused by hydrogen vacancies .",
    "it is known that graphene is not suitable for thermoelectrics because of its gapless band structure and high thermal conductivity .",
