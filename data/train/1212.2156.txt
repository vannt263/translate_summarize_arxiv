    "the effect of photon creation from vacuum in a cavity with rapidly varying geometrical or material properties , called nowadays as dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) , attracted attention of many researchers for a long time : see recent reviews @xcite .",
    "the first experimental results for the open strip - line waveguide with time - dependent boundary conditions , simulating a single oscillating ideal mirror in the one - dimensional space , were reported recently in @xcite .",
    "it is quite probable that new experiments in other geometries will be done soon , too .",
    "therefore , the problem of the back action of different detectors on the rate of photon generation becomes actual .",
    "the very first studies were performed in @xcite under the condition that the field - detector coupling is much stronger than the effective coupling between the selected resonance field mode in the cavity and moving boundary ( due to strong limitations on the attainable amplitude of surface oscillations in real materials ) .    however , since that time there were proposed several schemes on simulating the dce by means of changing not the positions of boundaries but their material properties @xcite . in such cases the effective velocity of boundaries can be increased by several orders of magnitude , therefore the situations where the modulation depth of the instantaneous cavity eigenfrequency is bigger than the normalized field - detector coupling coefficient can be considered now quite realistic , as well .",
    "there are two simple models of detectors .",
    "one of them describes the detector as a two - level `` atom '' @xcite .",
    "it can be applied for the experimental setup proposed in @xcite .",
    "this case was extensively studied in different regimes in @xcite , and generalizations to the three- and multi - level `` atoms '' were considered in @xcite . here",
    "we consider another simple model , where the detector is represented by a harmonic oscillator tuned in resonance with the selected field mode @xcite .",
    "this model seems to be adequate to the case of the so called mir experiment @xcite , where the microwave quanta created via the dce are supposed to be detected by means of a small antenna put inside the cavity . since the inductive antenna ( a wire loop ) used in that experiment is a part of a lc - contour , it can be reasonably approximated as a harmonic oscillator .",

    "the influence of all other cavity modes can be neglected if the spectrum of cavity eigenfrequencies is not equidistant @xcite .    if @xmath14 , then one can diagonalize hamiltonian ( [ htot ] ) , introducing two normal modes , whose frequencies are given by the exact formula @xmath15 , so that for @xmath16 we have @xmath17 we assume that the modulation frequency @xmath11 is twice bigger than one of the two splitted normal frequencies .",
