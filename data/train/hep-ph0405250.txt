    "<S> the value of @xmath40 is taken from the cancellation condition of eq.([cancellation ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results reported in this article present a complete calculation of the matrix elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 to order @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the vector mesons restores to a large extent the unitarity of the theory and acts as an upper cut - off for the integrals . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that a non - linear chiral lagrangian with a hidden local symmetry may be a more suitable low energy limit for qcd .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned already , the values of the matrix elements are very stable . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath2 uses the coefficient functions of ndr at @xmath105gev and @xmath144gev . </S>",
    "<S> we found an improved stability of the values for @xmath2 which are consistent with the experimental results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusion is that the presence of vector mesons improves the calculation of the matrix elements by making them more stable functions of the cut - off .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that the chiral theory enlarged by the introduction of vector mesons can eliminate quadratic divergences to @xmath145 . </S>",
    "<S> the improved stability of @xmath0 is encouraging to extent the calculation to the initial state interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the changes to be small , but we plan to complete them and present them in a longer article @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the method to the amplitudes @xmath146 and @xmath147 will involve additional operators @xmath148 with considerable increase in the computational work . </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting , however , to find out whether vector mesons make these amplitudes also more stable .    the support of the `` bundesministerium fr bildung , wissenschaft , forschung und technologie '' , bonn under contract 05ht1pea9 is gratefully acknowledged . </S>",
