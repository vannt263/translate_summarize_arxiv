    "an intriguing development in the study of a high - mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) was the recent observation @xcite of magnetooscillations of the photoconductivity of a sample subjected to microwave radiation , as a function of the ratio @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are the radiation frequency and the cyclotron frequency , respectively .",
    "subsequent experiments , @xcite working with very - high - mobility samples , yielded yet another dramatic discovery : for sufficiently high radiation power , the minima of the oscillations evolve into  zero - resistance states \" , i.e. , the dissipative resistance of a sample becomes vanishingly small .",
    "the nature of the oscillations in the photoconductivity @xmath3 has raised a lot of interest .",
    "an important step was made in ref .  , where a direct connection between the emergence of the zero - resistance states and the oscillations was emphasized .",
    "specifically , it was recognized that _ whatever _ the nature of the oscillations , when they become so large that the linear _ dc _ response theory yields a negative @xmath4 , an instability is developed leading to the formation of domains of counter - flowing currents and thus to the zero measured resistance . following this approach ,",
    "a key issue which needs to be settled for understanding the experiments is the microscopic mechanism of the oscillatory photoconductivity ( opc ) .",
    "similarly to the conventional shubnikov ",
    "de haas oscillations , the growing body of theoretical work is focused on the oscillations of the density of states ( dos ) induced by the landau quantization as an essential element of the construction .",
    "the mechanism of the opc identified in ref .   and analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "hinges on the oscillations of the dos and is related to a radiation - induced change of the electron distribution function in energy space , @xmath5 , such that @xmath5 oscillates with varying both @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "a hallmark of this contribution to @xmath3 is that it yields an amplitude of the opc which is proportional to the inelastic relaxation time @xmath7 due to electron - electron collisions ( more effective at low temperatures than electron - phonon scattering ) .",
    "another mechanism of the opc , based on the effect of radiation on impurity scattering in the presence of the landau quantization , was suggested in ref .",
    "( an earlier , closely related variant of this approach was formulated in ref .  ) .",
    "a systematical theory of this contribution to @xmath4 was constructed in ref .  .",
    "comparing the results of refs .   and ref .",
    ", one sees that the mechanism @xcite dominates , i.e. , leads to much stronger oscillations , if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the single - particle relaxation time due to impurity scattering . for typical experimental parameters , a characteristic ratio @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite overall the results of ref .",
    "are in good agreement with the experimental data as regards the behavior of @xmath4 in the range of parameters where the opc is not too strongly damped , i.e. , where the experimental efforts have been focused so far .",
    "in particular , ref .   explains the emergence of strong oscillations and , in combination with ref .  , the formation of zero - resistance regions .",
    "while the agreement between theory and experiment is very encouraging , the situation is not so clear in the experimental limit of _ weak _ ( strongly damped ) oscillations .",
    "central to the identification of the microscopic mechanism of the oscillations is , on top of their period and phase , the behavior of their envelope with decreasing magnetic field @xmath11 . for any mechanism based on the dos oscillations ,",
    "the relation between the dos and opc damping factors is critically important .",
    "the opc @xcite is damped at low @xmath11 by a factor @xmath12 , where the ratio @xmath13 is a distinctive feature not sensitive to microscopic details of either disorder or weak inelastic interactions .",
    "@xcite however , as emphasized in ref .",
    ", the experimentally reported values of @xmath9 and @xmath14 do not satisfy this relation , with @xmath14 noticeably larger than @xmath15 , roughly by a factor of 10 in ref .   and by a factor of 3 in ref .  .",
    "taken at face value , the difference would mean that the amplitude of the opc observed at small @xmath11 is orders of magnitude higher than given by the mechanism based on the landau quantization , which might be considered as a hint about a different origin of the opc at small @xmath11 .",
    "alternatively , the experiments on the damping of shubnikov - de haas oscillations might overestimate the single - particle scattering rate @xmath16 , e.g. , because of inhomogeneous ( due to macroscopic inhomogeneities ) broadening of landau levels . to resolve this dilemma ,",
    "it is desirable to examine a range of mechanisms of the opc in the absence of the dos oscillations .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a mechanism of the opc governed by _",
    "quasiclassical _ memory effects .",
    "these are related to non - markovian correlations in electron dynamics .",
    "@xcite we assume that @xmath17 and completely neglect weak oscillations of the dos .",
    "the opc induced by the memory effects is not specific to any particular type of disorder ; however , below we concentrate on the following two - component model , @xcite where the memory effects are particularly prominent .",
    "we assume that there is a smooth random potential of remote donors that are separated by a large spacer @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fermi wavevector , from the 2deg plane and , in addition , there are rare short - range scatterers , e.g. , residual impurities located at or near the interface .",
    "we consider the case @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the zero-@xmath11 momentum relaxation times due to the short - range scatterers and the long - range disorder , respectively . from the experimental point of view",
    ", this choice is motivated by reports ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) that the zero-@xmath11 mobility in very - high - mobility structures is frequently limited by residual impurities and @xmath23 can be as large as 10 .",
    "although @xmath24 in our model , we assume that @xmath9 is determined by the smooth disorder , i.e. , @xmath25 .    the paper is organized as follows .",

    "a necessary input to the calculation of the _ quasiclassical _ opc is the memory effects , discarded in the boltzmann equation .",
    "however , to set up a systematic formalism , it is instructive to begin with a derivation of @xmath4 within the conventional kinetic theory .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the distribution function @xmath26 of electrons in momentum space reads : lg(p,,t)=-*f*_g(p,,t )  , [ 1 ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the _ dc _ electric field , @xmath30 is the _ ac _ field , @xmath31 is the angle of the momentum @xmath32 with respect to the direction of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the elastic and inelastic collision integrals , respectively .",

    "elastic collisions lead to relaxation of angular harmonics with @xmath38 ; in particular , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the momentum relaxation time .",
    "inelastic electron - electron collisions tend to equilibrate electrons among themselves but are not capable of establishing a steady - state dc photoconductivity . for the quasiclassical opc ( in contrast to that based on the dos oscillations , cf",
    ".  ref .  )",

    "we thus argue that the experiments on the damping of shubnikov - de haas oscillations might strongly overestimate the single - particle scattering rate @xmath16 .",
    "one of the reasons could be the presence of macroscopic inhomogeneities leading to an inhomogeneous broadening of landau levels , which might be by far larger than the homogeneous broadening given by @xmath16 and measured in the photoconductivity experiments ( such a possibility was mentioned in ref .  ) .",

    "we have calculated the leading contribution associated with a radiation - induced change of the electron distribution function , which is proportional to the inelastic ( electron - phonon ) relaxation time .",
