    "spectral lines of mg  v are frequently observed from a wide range of astrophysical plasmas , including the sun ( see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , other stars @xcite , and planetary nebulae @xcite . similarly , mg  v lines have also been detected from laboratory plasmas ( @xcite , @xcite ) . since many emission line pairs of mg  v are density or temperature sensitive @xcite , they provide excellent diagnostics for astrophysical plasmas .",
    "however , the analysis of observations requires information on atomic data , such as energy levels , radiative rates ( a - values ) , and excitation rates which are obtained from the collision strengths ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "measurements of energy levels for mg  v have been compiled and assessed by @xcite and their recommended values are available on the nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) website http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm . however , to our knowledge there are no measurements for the a - values and @xmath8 , and therefore theoretical results for these are required .",
    "early calculations for @xmath8 ( and effective collision strengths @xmath6 ) for mg  v were performed by @xcite and @xcite , but only for transitions among levels of the @xmath9=2 configurations .",
    "their results are not sufficient for the analysis of observed lines in the x - ray region , because these arise from levels of the @xmath9=3 configurations @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xcite extended the work to include 37 levels of the 2s@xmath02p@xmath1 , 2s2p@xmath2 , 2p@xmath3 , 2s@xmath02p@xmath43s , and 2s@xmath02p@xmath43p configurations .",
    "they adopted the breit - pauli @xmath10-matrix method of @xcite , although their calculations were primarily in @xmath11 coupling ( russell - saunders or spin - orbit coupling ) .",
    "however , for a lowly ionised ion , such as mg  v , this method should not affect the accuracy of the calculated data , because relativistic effects are not too important .",
    "furthermore , @xcite resolved resonances in a narrow energy mesh and presented values of @xmath6 over a wide temperature range , up to 10@xmath12  k. however , a much larger calculation involving 86 levels of the 2s@xmath02p@xmath1 , 2s2p@xmath2 , 2p@xmath3 , and 2s@xmath02p@xmath43@xmath5 configurations , has already been reported by @xcite . for the calculation of energy levels they adopted the _ superstructure _ ( ss ) code and",
    "considered up to 24 configurations ( @xmath13 4 ) . however , for the scattering calculations , their wavefunctions were rather basic ( among the above listed six configurations ) and hence the discrepancies between the calculated energies and the nist compilation are significant for several levels , in both magnitude and orderings  see table 1 of @xcite , and note particularly the position of the 2p@xmath3  @xmath14s@xmath15 level .",
    "more importantly , they calculated their data for @xmath8 at only five energies , in the 1050  ryd range , with the _ distorted wave _ ( dw ) method , and did not consider resonances in the thresholds region .",
    "since resonances for transitions in mg  v are very important ( see section 5 ) , the results obtained for @xmath6 from their calculated values of @xmath8 are likely to be highly underestimated for many transitions , particularly non - dipole allowed ones .",
    "therefore , recently @xcite have performed yet another calculation for mg  v. they have considered the same 86 levels of the six configurations as by @xcite , but have made several improvements over their work . for the determination of atomic structure ( i.e. to calculate energy levels and a - values ) they adopted the multi - configuration hartree - fock ( mchf ) code of @xcite , used non - orthogonal orbitals up to @xmath9=5 ( @xmath16 4 ) , and included very large _ configuration interaction _ ( ci ) , up to 5179 . as a result ,",
    "the accuracy of their calculated energy levels is much better ",
    "see their table 1 .",
    "advantages of this methodology ( over the use of orthogonal orbitals ) include the determination of accurate energy levels , but avoidance of pseudo resonances in the subsequent scattering calculations , as faced by @xcite",
    ". however , the inclusion of such a large ci is not feasible in the scattering calculations , due to computational limitations .",
    "therefore , @xcite had to make a compromise by reducing the ci to 427 configurations , and the energies obtained with this reduced model are not too different from the larger one  see their table  1 .    for the calculation of @xmath8 , @xcite adopted the b - spline @xmath10-matrix ( bsr ) code developed by @xcite .",
    "they included a moderately large range of partial waves with angular momentum @xmath17 up to 29.5 , but calculated @xmath8 over a wide energy range up to 50  ryd .",
    "to resolve resonances in the thresholds region they considered up to as narrow an energy mesh as 0.000  05  ryd , and reported values of @xmath6 up to t@xmath18 = 10@xmath3  k. therefore , their calculated results not only cover a larger range of transitions , but would be expected to be the most accurate .",
    "hence , there should be no strong reason to perform yet another calculation for mg  v. however , they conclude that they observed a good agreement for most transitions between their results of @xmath6 and those of @xcite .",
    "we do not find this to be true ( as discussed below ) , and hence have undertaken a further calculation .    in fig .",
    "1 ( a , b and c ) we show comparisons of @xmath6 calculated by @xcite and @xcite , referred to as rm1 and rm2 for convenience , at three temperatures of 10@xmath1 , 10@xmath2 , and 10@xmath3  k. these are shown as the ratio ( r ) of @xmath19/@xmath20 , with negative values indicating @xmath20/@xmath19 .",
    "two conclusions can be easily drawn from this figure .",
    "first , the discrepancies are large ( up to two orders of magnitude ) for a significant number of transitions ( @xmath2180% ) , and second the agreement worsens with increasing t@xmath18 .",
    "it is interesting to note that at t@xmath18 = 10@xmath3  k , the @xmath20 of @xcite are much larger than those of @xcite , whereas the opposite would be expected , because the rm2 calculations included more levels , and hence significantly more resonances .",
    "we discuss these comparisons in more detail below to try to understand the reasons for the discrepancies .    at t@xmath18=10@xmath1  k ,",
    "the @xmath19 are larger than @xmath20 for many transitions , by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "differences between the two sets of @xmath6 are greater than 20% for 83% of transitions . for only a few ,",
    "@xmath20 are larger than @xmath19 , by a maximum of a factor of 40 .",
    "although 10@xmath1  k is a comparatively low temperature at which the positions and magnitudes of resonances are very important , the differences between the two sets of @xmath6 are still very large , considering that both calculations resolved resonances in a fine energy mesh , i.e. 0.0008  ryd in rm1 and 0.000  05  ryd in rm2 . the most noticeable discrepancies seen in fig .",
    "1a are for the transitions : 510 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath14s@xmath15 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath43s  @xmath2s@xmath22 : r = 430 , out of scale ) , 531 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath14s@xmath15 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath43p  @xmath4f@xmath23 : r = 60 ) , 532 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath14s@xmath15 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath43p  @xmath4f@xmath24 : r = 92 ) , 533 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath14s@xmath15 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath43p  @xmath4f@xmath25 : r = 126 ) , and 534 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath14s@xmath15 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath43p  @xmath14f@xmath24 : r = 60 ) .",
    "all these are forbidden transitions and therefore the number and magnitude of resonances may considerably affect the determination of @xmath6 . we also note that the ordering ( labelling ) of these levels is that given in table  1 ( but slightly different from rm1 and rm2 , which position the 2s@xmath02p@xmath43s  @xmath2s@xmath22 level at number 11 ) , but there is no ambiguity in comparing results . since the discrepancy is greatest for the 510 transition , we focus our attention on this alone .",
    "the background value of @xmath8 ( @xmath26 ) for this transition in the thresholds region is @xmath2110@xmath27 in our calculations ( see section 4 ) and is @xmath2110@xmath28 at energies well above the thresholds , comparable to the dw results of @xcite , and resonances are neither too numerous nor too large in magnitude .",
    "subsequently , our values of @xmath6 for this transition are @xmath2110@xmath27 ( see table  5 in section 5 ) .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath6 of rm1 and rm2 are lower and higher , respectively , than our result by about an order of magnitude , and hence the discrepancies",
    ". if @xcite have some very large resonances close to the threshold , then their @xmath6 may be considerably higher towards the lower end of t@xmath18 .",
    "indeed this is the case as may be noted from fig . 1 ( b and c ) , because the discrepancies have decreased with increasing temperature .    at t@xmath18=10@xmath2  k ,",
    "the rm1 and rm2 values of @xmath6 differ for 79% of transitions by over 20% , and in most cases the results of @xcite are larger , as seen in fig .",
    "however , at t@xmath18=10@xmath3  k the trend has reversed , as for most transitions the @xmath6 of @xcite are larger by up to three orders of magnitude ( note that a few transitions are out of scale in fig .",
    "this is not expected ( as noted already ) and the greatest discrepancies are for the transitions : 1624 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath43p  @xmath2p@xmath29 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath43s  @xmath4p@xmath30 : r = 980 ) , 1625 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath43p  @xmath2p@xmath29 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath43s  @xmath4p@xmath22 : r = 980 ) , and 1834 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath43p  @xmath2p@xmath24 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath43p  @xmath14f@xmath24 : r = 820 ) .",
    "the first two are inter - combination transitions ( but very weak as their f - values are 3.6@xmath3110@xmath28 and 1.6@xmath3110@xmath32 , respectively ) whereas the third is forbidden . a temperature of 10@xmath3  k corresponds to @xmath216.3  ryd and the above transitions are close to the highest level ( 37 ) considered by @xcite .",
    "hence , the contribution of resonances ( if any ) should not be too significant .",
    "clearly , the @xmath6 of @xcite are overestimated at high values of t@xmath18 , because they calculated data for @xmath8 only up to 28  ryd , but determined @xmath6 up to t@xmath18 = 10@xmath12  k , i.e. @xmath2163  ryd .",
    "there is no mention in their paper if they extrapolated values of @xmath8 to high energies , but one of the authors ( cathy ramsbottom ) confirms that they did not .",
    "an inspection of the @xmath6 values of @xcite over a wide temperature range also indicates they are overestimated at high t@xmath18 , because for many transitions ( such as : 1624 , 1625 , 1734 , 1832 , and 1834 ) their results increase by ( almost ) up to three orders of magnitude between the lowest ( 10@xmath4  k ) and the greatest ( 10@xmath12  k ) temperature .",
    "values of @xmath6 are not ( generally ) known to vary so largely . additionally , these transitions are either weak inter - combination or forbidden , and therefore their values of @xmath8 and subsequently @xmath6 should decrease considerably with increasing energy / temperature .",
    "this is indeed the case with the results of @xcite and @xcite , or in our calculations ",
    "see table  5 in section 5 . in conclusion",
    ", we may confidently state that the results of @xcite are overestimated , at least at high t@xmath18 .",
    "we therefore do not discuss their results further .",
    "the temperature range below 10@xmath3  k is most important for the analysis of astrophysical observations of mg  v lines @xcite , and unfortunately there are large discrepancies between the values of @xmath6 calculated by @xcite and @xcite , as shown in fig . 1 and discussed above .",
    "additionally , we have reason to suspect the accuracy of the results for @xmath6 reported by @xcite , but will discuss these in detail more appropriately in section 5 .",
    "therefore , we have performed one more calculation for this important ion , and for consistency as well as for practical ( computational ) reasons include the same 86 levels as by @xcite .",
    "however , our approach is different ( but similar ) from their work because for the generation of wavefunctions we have adopted the fully relativistic grasp ( general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ) code , originally developed by @xcite , but significantly revised by dr .",
    "p. h. norrington .",
    "it is a fully relativistic code , based on the @xmath33 coupling scheme .",
    "further higher order relativistic terms arising from the breit interaction and qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) effects ( vacuum polarisation and lamb shift ) have also been included in the same way as described in the original version .",
    "additionally , we have used the option of _ extended average level _ ( eal ) , in which a weighted ( proportional to 2@xmath34 + 1 ) trace of the hamiltonian matrix is minimised .",
    "this produces a compromise set of orbitals describing closely lying states with moderate accuracy , and generally yields results comparable to other options , such as _ average level _",
    "finally , energy levels and radiative data determined with grasp are generally comparable with those obtained with other codes , such as civ3 , fac , mchf , and ss , provided similar ci is included .",
    "a particularly useful feature of the adopted version is that it also has provisions for listing the @xmath35 designations of the levels / configurations , apart from the usual @xmath33 nomenclature of the relativistic codes .",
    "this feature helps in correctly identifying the states / levels and facilitates direct comparisons with other calculations .",
    "another useful advantage of this version is that its output can be directly linked to the collisional code ( i.e. the _ dirac atomic r - matrix code _ , darc ) , adopted here for the scattering calculations .",
    "this code also includes the relativistic effects in a systematic way , in both the target description and the scattering model , because it is based on the @xmath33 coupling scheme , and uses the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian in the @xmath10-matrix approach .",
    "however , the code does not include the breit and qed corrections , and hence the target energies obtained are slightly different ( and comparatively less accurate ) than from grasp .",
    "a disadvantage of this code is that the calculations are more time consuming because the size of the hamiltonian matrix is large , due to the inclusion of fine - structure in the definition of channel coupling . on the other hand ,",
    "an advantage of the code is that resonances arising in between the fine - structure levels of a state can be included , and hence improving the further calculations of effective collision strengths  note particularly the ground state levels ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath36 ) in table  1 .",
    "both the atomic structure and scattering codes , i.e. grasp and darc , are hosted at the website : + http://amdpp.phys.strath.ac.uk/uk_apap/codes.html .",
    "finally , we stress that although we have adopted fully relativistic codes for calculations of both atomic structure and collisional parameters , the relativistic effects are not too important for a comparatively light ion such as mg  v.",
    "determining the atomic structure of mg  v is not simple and straightforward , as also discussed by @xcite  see their table  1 . for the same reason ,",
    "@xcite considered a large ci and adopted the route of pseudo ( correlation ) and non - orthogonal orbitals .",
    "our darc code does not allow such a provision and therefore , as in most of our work on many other ions , we use the orthogonal orbitals .",
    "however , we consider 12 configurations , namely 2s@xmath02p@xmath1 , 2s2p@xmath2 , 2p@xmath3 , 2s@xmath02p@xmath43@xmath5 , 2s2p@xmath13@xmath5 , and 2p@xmath23@xmath5 , which generate 226 levels in total . inclusion of these configurations considerably improves the accuracy of the energy levels and is a good ` compromise ' for the subsequent calculations of scattering parameters . furthermore ,",
    "as stated above , the calculations for energy levels have been performed in an ` extended average level ' ( eal ) approximation .",
    "the contribution of breit and qed ( quantum electrodynamic ) effects has also been included , but has been found to be insignificant , as expected .    in table  1",
    "we compare our grasp energies with the measurements compiled by nist , and with other calculations , namely mchf1 @xcite , mchf2 @xcite , and ss @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that the mchf2 energies are listed from the website http://nlte.nist.gov/mchf/view.html , and are _ slightly _ different from those given in @xcite . as expected ,",
    "the mchf1 and mchf2 energies are comparable , in both magnitude and orderings , and the slight differences observed for a few levels ( such as 2325 ) are due to the ` reduced ' ci model considered by @xcite for the collisional work .",
    "otherwise , the discrepancies between the two sets of energies are ( even ) smaller , as may be seen in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "the ss energies calculated by @xcite are in worse agreement with nist , in both magnitude and orderings , because of the limited ci , and this has already been commented on by these authors .",
    "our calculated energies with the grasp code are comparatively more accurate than those of ss , because of the larger ci included .",
    "however , there is scope for improvement , but keeping in mind our further ( and more important ) calculations for @xmath8 , it is a reasonable compromise as already stated .",
    "differences with the nist compilation are within 0.1  ryd for most levels , except 12 ( 2p@xmath3  @xmath14s@xmath15 ) which differs by 0.4  ryd and its position is also different . a few more levels for which the orderings ( slightly ) differ between our work and nist are 13/14 , 6567 , and 6971 , but all these are closely lying",
    ", i.e. @xmath37e is very small .",
    "finally , we note that the 2p@xmath43d  @xmath14s@xmath38 and 2p@xmath43p  @xmath14s@xmath15 levels ( 58 and 60 ) have reverse orderings between grasp and mchf1 ( and mchf2 ) .",
    "however , a closer look at the @xmath6 results of @xcite indicates that their ordering for these two levels is the same as ours , and this has been based on the trend of the allowed and forbidden transitions related to these levels .",
    "some of the levels listed in table  1 ( under the grasp column ) are not strictly in the order of increasing energy ",
    "see for example , levels 1315 , 35/36 , 38/39 , 6163 , and 65/66 .",
    "this is because the contributions of breit and qed effects ( included in grasp but not in darc ) , although not very significant as already stated , alters the orderings of the coulomb energies , used in the calculations of @xmath8 and subsequently @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the orderings of levels for all atomic parameters , namely energies , a - values , @xmath39 , @xmath8 , and @xmath6 , are consistent with the one listed in table  1 , although some anomalies for energies are noticeable .",
    "besides energy levels , we have also calculated a - values for four types of transitions , namely electric dipole ( e1 ) , electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , and magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) , because these are required for plasma modelling as well as for the determination of lifetimes ( @xmath39 ) , a measurable quantity .",
    "our calculated energies / wavelengths ( @xmath40 , in @xmath41 ) , radiative rates ( a@xmath42 , in s@xmath43 ) , oscillator strengths ( f@xmath44 , dimensionless ) , and line strengths ( s , in atomic unit = 6.460@xmath3110@xmath45 cm@xmath0 esu@xmath0 ) are listed in table  2 for all e1 transitions , but only among the lowest 86 levels of mg  v , although calculations have been performed for 226 levels ( see section 2 ) .",
    "this is because our subsequent calculations for @xmath8 and @xmath6 are only for these 86 levels .",
    "the _ indices _ used to represent the lower and upper levels of a transition are defined in table  1 .",
    "furthermore , for the e2 , m1 , and m2 transitions only the a - values are listed in table  2 , because corresponding data for f - values can be easily obtained through the following equation , i.e.    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the electron mass and charge , respectively , @xmath50 the velocity of light , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 the statistical weights of the lower ( @xmath53 ) and upper ( @xmath34 ) levels , respectively .",
    "finally , results are only listed in the length form , which are ( generally ) considered to be comparatively more accurate .",
    "however , ratio of the velocity and length forms of a - values for e1 transitions are also listed in this table as a last column , as it gives an indication of the accuracy of the calculated data .",
    "similar results , particularly for the e1 transitions , are available in the literature , mainly by @xcite and @xcite , and the latter have also shown comparisons with earlier existing results . since the a - values of @xcite are comparatively more accurate ( because of the inclusion of larger ci and hence more accurate determination of energy levels and subsequent other atomic parameters ) we compare our results with them ( mchf1 ) alone . in table  3",
    "are compared the f - values for transitions among the lowest 13 levels , and as expected , the agreement between our grasp and their mchf1 results is ( generally ) within 20% , particularly for those which have significant magnitude . however , for a few weaker transitions , such as 47 , 413 , and 513 , discrepancies are up to a factor of two , whereas for 1213 ( f@xmath21 10@xmath28 ) the two sets of f - values differ by three orders of magnitude .",
    "such discrepancies for weak(er ) transitions , between any two calculations differing in ci and/or methodology , are quite common .",
    "similarly , the ratio ( r ) of the velocity and length forms are generally within 20% of unity , but are larger for the weak(er ) transitions , as also shown in fig.1 of @xcite . finally , we stress that the f- ( a- ) values of @xcite may be comparatively more accurate ( for the reasons already stated ) , but our results are given again in table  2 for two reasons , i.e. firstly for consistency with our subsequent results of @xmath6 ( see section 5 ) and secondly , for the addition of the e2 , m1 , and m2 transitions , which were not considered by @xcite .",
    "inclusion of a - values for all types of transitions results in a more accurate determination of the lifetime ( @xmath39 = 1.0/@xmath54 ) .",
    "this is a measurable quantity and helps in assessing the accuracy of the calculated data .",
    "unfortunately , no measurements of @xmath39 are available for the levels of mg  v , but the theoretical mchf2 results of @xcite are available on the website http://nlte.nist.gov/mchf/view.html . therefore , in table  1 we have also listed our and their calculated values of @xmath39 for all levels . for most ,",
    "the two sets of @xmath39 agree within @xmath2120% , but discrepancies are larger ( by up to a factor of two ) for a few levels , such as 4045 for which the grasp results are lower .",
    "these differences are a direct consequence of the corresponding discrepancies in the a - values .",
    "for example , for level 40 ( 2p@xmath43p  @xmath4s@xmath29 ) the dominant a - value is for the 640 e1 transition , for which our result is 2.67@xmath3110@xmath55 ( s@xmath43 ) whereas that from mchf2 is 6.55@xmath3110@xmath56 ( s@xmath43 ) .",
    "this is a weak transition ( f @xmath21 10@xmath27 ) for which the differences in f- and a - values have already been noted . the same analysis applies to other levels where the discrepancies are large . in the absence of measurements or other theoretical results ,",
    "it is difficult to say with confidence which set of @xmath39 values is more accurate .",
    "as stated in section  1 , we have adopted the relativistic darc code for calculating @xmath8 , a symmetric and dimensionless quantity . the @xmath10-matrix radius adopted for mg",
    "v is 8.0 atomic units , and 62 continuum orbitals ( nrang2 ) have been included for each channel angular momentum in the expansion of the wavefunction .",
    "this large expansion allows us to compute results for @xmath8 up to an energy of 30 ryd .",
    "furthermore , the maximum number of channels generated for a partial wave is 388 , but considering the high value of nrang2 the size of the ( largest ) hamiltonian ( h ) matrix becomes 24  079 . for calculating @xmath8",
    "we have considered all partial waves with angular momentum @xmath57 40.5 , sufficient for convergence for a majority of transitions and at all energies .",
    "however , to improve the accuracy further we have included the contribution of higher neglected partial waves through the coulomb - bethe @xcite and geometric series approximations for allowed and forbidden transitions , respectively .    to our knowledge no measurements for @xmath8",
    "have been made for the transitions of mg  v , and the only theoretical results available for comparison with our data are those of @xcite . some differences with their results are expected , because they have adopted the dw method and ( more importantly ) their wavefunctions are basic , as already stated in section 1 . nevertheless , in fig .",
    "2a we show the comparisons of @xmath8 for three forbidden transitions , namely 12 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath23 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath29 ) , 122 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath23 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath4(@xmath1s)3p  @xmath4p@xmath23 ) , and 142 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath23 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath4(@xmath0d)3p  @xmath4p@xmath23 ) .",
    "these transitions are selected because of their comparatively larger magnitudes .",
    "for the 12 and 122 transitions there are no discrepancies between the two sets of @xmath8 , but for 142 our results are lower by up to 15% . we stress that for this ( and most other ) forbidden transitions , the values of @xmath8 have fully converged within our partial waves range .",
    "in fact , for this transition , @xmath8 has converged within the lowest 20 partial waves alone , and therefore the discrepancies noted here are because of the differences in methodology and the wavefunctions .",
    "similar comparisons are shown in fig .",
    "2b for three allowed transitions , namely 16 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath23  2s2p@xmath2  @xmath4p@xmath22 ) , 17 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath23 ",
    "2s2p@xmath2  @xmath4p@xmath30 ) , and 49 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath14d@xmath23 ",
    "2s2p@xmath2  @xmath14p@xmath30 ) . for these ( and many other ) allowed transitions",
    "there are no discrepancies between our results and those of @xcite , because the f - values are also comparable .",
    "therefore , we have confidence in our calculations for @xmath8 and in table  4 we list our results for all transitions from the ground level over the 930  ryd energy range",
    ". these data should be useful for future comparisons .",
    "our listed values of @xmath8 in table  4 are not very useful for applications .",
    "this is because , in most plasmas , electrons do not have mono - energetic velocities but rather have a distribution , most often a _ maxwellian _ one .",
    "furthermore , in the thresholds region values of @xmath8 do not vary as smoothly as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for most transitions , particularly the non - dipole allowed ones , the thresholds region is full of numerous closed - channel ( feshbach ) resonances , as shown by @xcite in their fig . 3 for three transitions , and by @xcite in their figs . 3 and 4 for two transitions",
    "however , the importance of resonances can not be fully appreciated from their figures , because they cover a very wide energy range , up to 50  ryd , whereas the thresholds region is below 9  ryd .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "3 ( a , b and c ) we show resonances for three transitions , namely 12 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath23 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath29 ) , 13 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath23 ",
    "2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath4p@xmath15 ) , and 49 ( 2s@xmath02p@xmath1  @xmath14d@xmath23 ",
    "2s2p@xmath2  @xmath14p@xmath30 ) . the first two",
    "are forbidden whereas the third is allowed .",
    "it is clear from these figures that resonances are not only dense but also have large magnitudes . for this reason",
    ", @xcite resolved these in a fine energy mesh , up to 0.000  05  ryd in some energy regions . in most of the thresholds region ,",
    "our energy mesh is 0.0001  ryd and in total we have calculated @xmath8 at 47  114 energies , compared to @xcite who used 34  352 energy points .    from the data for @xmath8 , the effective collision strengths @xmath6 are determined as follows :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is boltzmann constant , t@xmath18 the electron temperature in k , and e@xmath60 the electron energy with respect to the final ( excited ) state .",
    "this value of @xmath6 is related to the excitation q(i , j ) and de - excitation q(j , i ) rates as follows :    @xmath61    and @xmath62 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the statistical weights of the initial ( @xmath53 ) and final ( @xmath34 ) states , respectively , and e@xmath44 is the transition energy .",
    "results for these rates are required in the modelling of plasmas .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath6 are listed in table  5 up to t@xmath18 = 10@xmath63  k , well above the temperature of maximum abundance in ionisation equilibrium for mg  v , i.e. 10@xmath64  k @xcite . as discussed in section  1 ,",
    "the most recent , extensive and perhaps best available corresponding data for @xmath6 are those of @xcite .",
    "therefore , we undertake a detailed comparison with their results .    in fig .",
    "4 ( a , b and c ) we compare our results ( @xmath65 ) with those of @xcite ( @xmath66 ) in the form of the ratio r = @xmath66/@xmath67 , with negative values of r representing @xmath67/@xmath68 , i.e. @xmath69 .",
    "these comparisons of @xmath6 are for all transitions among the lowest 86 levels , and at three temperatures of 10@xmath1 , 10@xmath2 , and 10@xmath3  k. furthermore , they are similar to those shown in fig .  1 , but the lower levels ( i ) have been replaced by the upper ones ( j ) , as this provides a clearer picture of the similarities or differences among transitions up to level(s ) j.    from fig .",
    "4 two conclusions can be clearly drawn , i.e. the discrepancies between the two sets of @xmath6 worsen with increasing temperature , and for a majority of transitions @xmath69 , by up to two orders of magnitude . at 10@xmath1  k",
    ", there is reasonable agreement between the two sets of @xmath6 for transitions among the lowest @xmath2125 levels alone , but at 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3  k , this reduces to j = @xmath2120 and @xmath2115 , respectively .",
    "since the @xcite and our calculations are based on the @xmath10-matrix method , resolve resonances in a fine energy mesh , and have taken care to obtain converged values of @xmath8 at all energies and for all ( type of ) transitions , a much better agreement between the @xmath6 values is expected .",
    "unfortunately , the discrepancies are very large and therefore we discuss the potential reasons in detail .    as most of the discrepancies between the two sets of @xmath6 are for transitions among the higher levels of mg  v , in table  6 we compare our results with those of @xcite at three temperatures of 10@xmath1 , 10@xmath2 , and 10@xmath3  k , for all transitions with upper level 86 .",
    "this comparison alone should , we believe , be sufficient to obtain a clear(er ) idea about the discrepancies , and for the same reason we have also listed the f - values ( for allowed ) and @xmath8 values for all transitions at three energies of 9 , 12 , and 15  ryd . the energy of 9  ryd is close to that of threshold for level 86 ( i.e. @xmath218.3  ryd  see table  1 ) and resonances play no part in determining the @xmath6 for these transitions . hence , the values of @xmath8 and @xmath6 should increase / decrease with increasing energy / temperature , depending on the ( type of ) transition",
    "indeed , this is the case in our calculations as may be seen from table  6 .",
    "however , the @xmath6 of @xcite show a  hump \" at 10@xmath2  k for almost all transitions , i.e. between 10@xmath1 and 10@xmath3  k they first increase ( by up to a factor of two ) and then decrease .",
    "this trend in their @xmath6 results , except for the strong allowed transitions ( such as 586 , 4886 , and 6086 ) , indicates the presence of pseudo resonances in their calculated values of @xmath8 . to specifically avoid this problem they adopted the non - orthogonal orbitals in the construction of wavefunctions and employed the bsr code for the calculations of @xmath8 , but unfortunately their results are not correct .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "apart from pseudo resonances which affect the values of @xmath6 at higher temperatures , the @xcite results appear to be highly underestimated at low(er ) temperatures .",
    "this is ( again ) indicated by in particular the above - mentioned strong allowed transitions ",
    "see table  4 of @xcite  because between 10@xmath70 and 10@xmath3  k ( i.e. within 6.3  ryd ) their results _ increase _ by up to two orders of magnitude for several transitions , such as 4/5/9/18/26/51/55/56 to 86 , which include both allowed ( 4/5/55 to 86 ) and forbidden ( 9/18/26/51/56 to 86 ) .",
    "such a large increase in @xmath6 values is ( generally ) not found , particularly for transitions which do not have any resonance contributions .",
    "we do not observe this in our calculations for mg  v and nor have , for example , @xcite in their work on s  iii , which is also a light , lowly - ionised ion .",
    "the only transitions for which our values of @xmath6 increase by up to a factor of 100 over this temperature range are three forbidden ( 1272 , 1826 , and 2638 ) and two inter - combination , namely 1271 ( f = 3.5@xmath3110@xmath32 ) and 1273 ( f = 9.5@xmath3110@xmath71 ) , and the reason for the increase is understandable , i.e. due to the large number of resonances .",
    "furthermore , for the 5/48/6086 allowed transitions , the f - values in the two calculations are comparable for 4886 , but differ by @xmath2150% for the other two .",
    "however , the @xmath6 of @xcite are comparable with our results at 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3  k , but are significantly underestimated at 10@xmath1  k ( by up to a factor of three ) as shown in table  6 .    for some forbidden transitions listed in table  6 , the @xmath6 of @xcite increase ( by up to two orders of magnitude  see their table  4 for full results ) with increasing temperature whereas our values decrease ( by a maximum factor of three ) , and are in accordance with the corresponding behaviour of @xmath8 .",
    "examples of such transitions are : 9/17/34/37/38/68/74 to 86 .",
    "a part of the reason for these anomalies may be that @xcite calculated values of @xmath8 up to an energy of 50  ryd , but the partial waves range included was only up to 29.5 , although they did include the contribution of higher neglected partial waves with top - ups in the same way as in our calculations . in comparison",
    "we included all partial waves up to @xmath17 = 40.5 to calculate @xmath8 up to 30  ryd , sufficient to determine @xmath6 up to 10@xmath3  k , as already discussed .",
    "some transitions , such as 3486 ( 2p@xmath43p  @xmath14f@xmath24 ",
    "2p@xmath43d  @xmath14p@xmath30 ) , 6886 ( 2p@xmath43d  @xmath14p@xmath30 ",
    "2p@xmath43d  @xmath14p@xmath30 ) , and 7486 ( 2p@xmath43d  @xmath14f@xmath72 ",
    "2p@xmath43d  @xmath14p@xmath30 ) converge very slowly , particularly towards the higher end of the energy range .",
    "we have undertaken test calculations with top - ups at j = 20.5 , 30.5 , and 40.5 to assess what differences they make .",
    "values of @xmath8 obtained with top - up at 20.5 are larger by up to 50% than at 30.5 , for some transitions ( such as those mentioned here ) at an energy of 30  ryd .",
    "however , a similar comparison with top - ups at 30.5 and 40.5 shows a maximum difference of @xmath2110% .",
    "however , similar comparisons at 50  ryd will almost certainly be different and most likely the values of @xmath8 in the calculations of @xcite are overestimated , although this can not be confirmed as their data are not available .",
    "nevertheless , it does explain ( to some extent ) why for some forbidden transitions their @xmath6 results increase with increasing temperature .",
    "therefore , for many transitions their @xmath6 values appear to be underestimated towards the lower end of the temperature range but overestimated at the higher end , and hence the discrepancies shown in fig .  4 and table  6 .",
    "however , _ if _ the @xmath6 of @xcite are overestimated , particularly at higher temperatures , because of the presence of pseudo resonances and/or overestimation in their calculated values of @xmath8 ( as discussed earlier ) , then why are our results still larger for many transitions , as shown in fig .  4 . to understand this anomaly we need to undertake some additional comparisons .    in fig .  5 ( a , b and c ) we compare the two sets of @xmath73 again , as in fig .  4 , but this time replacing the upper levels ( j ) with lower ones ( i )",
    "it is clear from this figure that the maximum discrepancies are for transitions from lower levels below 12 , and our results are invariably higher ( by up to two orders of magnitude ) at all temperatures .",
    "there are a few more transitions ( such as 9  52/53/54 and 23 43 ) which are out of scale , but among those shown in fig .  5 are two  1228 ( 2p@xmath3  @xmath14s@xmath15 ",
    "2p@xmath43p  @xmath4d@xmath23 ) and 12  30 ( 2p@xmath3  @xmath14s@xmath15 ",
    "2p@xmath43p  @xmath4d@xmath24 )  both forbidden , for which our @xmath6 are higher by a factor of 140 at 10@xmath3  k. in fig .",
    "6 we show our @xmath8 for the 1230 transition alone .",
    "although there are some resonances for this ( and other similar ) transitions , they are neither too dense nor too large in magnitude , and therefore our greater values of @xmath6 are not because of the resonances , but due to the background values of collision strengths ( @xmath26 ) , which are @xmath2110@xmath27 and so are the @xmath6 results . we also note that at energies above thresholds ( 930  ryd range ) our values of @xmath8 are comparable with the dw results of @xcite , and therefore we have confidence in our data . in conclusion , for some transitions for which our @xmath6 are larger than of @xcite , the differences are ( probably ) due to the corresponding values of @xmath26  see also section  1 regarding the discussion about the 510 transition .",
    "in this paper we have reported energies and lifetimes for the lowest 86 levels of the 2s@xmath02p@xmath1 , 2s2p@xmath2 , 2p@xmath3 , and 2s@xmath02p@xmath43@xmath5 configurations of mg  v. differences with the compiled experimental energies of nist are within 0.1  ryd for most levels , except 2p@xmath3  @xmath14s@xmath15 for which our result is higher by 0.4  ryd .",
    "in addition , the ordering of levels also slightly differs in a few instances .",
    "similarly , there is a good agreement ( within 20% ) between our calculated values of @xmath39 and those of @xcite ( available on the web ) for most levels , and differences for a few are within a factor of two , due to the corresponding differences in the a - values .",
    "radiative rates for e1 .",
    "e2 , m1 , and m2 transitions are also provided and there is a good agreement with other available theoretical results for e1 transitions .",
    "although scope remains for improvement in the accuracy of the reported data , due to computational restraints it is not possible in the present work , bearing in mind our further calculations for the more important collisional parameters .",
    "collision strengths have been calculated with the fully relativistic darc code and are listed for all transitions , from ground to higher excited levels , at energies up to 30  ryd .",
    "furthermore , resonances in the thresholds region have been resolved in a fine energy mesh ( 0.0001  ryd ) to determine @xmath6 values at temperatures up to 10@xmath3  k , sufficient for applications to the modelling of a variety of plasmas .",
    "similar results for the same number of transitions and with the @xmath10-matrix code ( bsr ) are available @xcite , but discrepancies between the two sets of data are significant ( up to two orders of magnitude ) for over 60% of the transitions , and at all temperatures . in some cases the earlier @xmath6 are larger , but for a majority of transitions our results are higher .",
    "these discrepancies have been discussed in detail and the likely reasons for them include : pseudo resonances , overestimation in the values of @xmath8 at higher energies , and incorrect trends in the behaviour of transitions . based on a number of comparisons ,",
    "the earlier values of @xmath6 by @xcite are assessed to be inaccurate .",
    "some discrepancies between the present and @xcite sets of @xmath6 are expected because the atomic structures are different .",
    "however , the scale of the discrepancies can not be explained by differences in the atomic structure alone .",
    "for example , discrepancies in @xmath6 for the allowed transitions are not proportionate to the corresponding differences in the f - values .",
    "similarly , for many forbidden transitions ( including the weak(er ) ones ) , the @xmath6 trends of @xcite can not be correct , because their results significantly increase with increasing temperature whereas the reverse is expected .",
    "our presented results for @xmath6 are probably the best available todate and therefore , we believe , should be adopted for the modelling and diagnostics of plasmas",
    ". however , scope remains for improvement .",
    "apart from improving the accuracy of the wavefunctions , the main scope is in expanding the collisional calculations to all 226 levels of mg  v. this will definitely improve the accuracy of transitions , particularly among the higher levels , because all remaining 140 levels lie just above the lowest 86 and at energies below 13.7  ryd .",
    "resonances arising from these levels will significantly contribute to the calculations of @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately our present computational resources are inadequate to undertake such a large calculation , but that may be possible sometime in the future .",
