    "since the early days of quantum mechanics it has been realized that indinguishability of quantum particles is a fundamental feature of the theory and has important consequences for the interpretation of physical phenomena.@xcite from the point of view of the present research activity , it is worth noticing that novel applications in the context of quantum technologies such as sub - shot - noise quantum metrology@xcite rely on the consequences of the symmetrization postulate of quantum mechanics and on the role of a fundamental resource as quantum entanglement.@xcite the latest is a direct consequence of linearity ( superposition principle ) in tensor product hilbert spaces .    due to its importance both for the comprehension of the foundations of quantum mechanics and for experimental applications ,",
    "the study of the relation between correlations and the properties of identical particles has attracted a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "a careful definition of entanglement criteria for the state vector of a system of identical particles is necessary and can be based on the properties of the schmidt eigenvalues and on the evaluation of the von neumann entropy of the single - party reduced density operators.@xcite recent results stress the fact that one should also consider the measurement prescription used in the experiment.@xcite the concepts of separability has been extended to the case of identical particles also in terms of commuting algebras of observables@xcite ensuring the entanglement detection through a partial transposition criterion.@xcite moreover , the use of representation theory of the symmetry group can lead to distinguish the entanglement of pure states using a proper generalization of the notion of schmidt rank.@xcite finally , an approach through the gns construction@xcite has been recently proposed in ref .",
    "based on the use of the general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras .    as a matter of fact",
    ", this intense research activity shows that the problem still deserves attention and further analysis in order to be completely clarified . in this paper",
    "we will investigate the properties of states of indistinguishable particles .",
    "in particular , we will elaborate on an idea introduced by peres@xcite and related to the notion of cluster separability . by an explicit calculation ( after tracing out the spatial degrees of freedom )",
    ", we will show that the condition of spatial separation ( described in terms of disjoint domains of the projection operators ) makes the role of indistinguishability completely ineffective on the structure of the reduced density operator .",
    "this condition has been already recognized as the natural request in order to recover the distinguishability of identical particles in experiments with fermions and bosons.@xcite as a consequence , the standard paradigm of alice and bob , largely used in the context of quantum communication and quantum information processing , is still valid in the presence of identical particles .",
    "we will also extend this analysis to the case of @xmath0 identical particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : identical ] we will briefly review some fundamental notions and the formalism for describing indistinguishable particles . in section [ sec : trace ]",
    "we will show how the partial trace over the spatial degrees of freedom and the hypothesis of spatial separation among the spin measurements allows to treat the reduced state independently of the particle statistics .",
    "we will consider both the case of two and @xmath0 indistinguishable particles .",
    "section [ sec : finite ] is devoted to some considerations on symmetry . in section [ sec : subalgebra ] we will frame our results in terms of algebras of observables .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we will draw some conclusions .",
    "in order to set the notation , we briefly review the basic concepts and the formalism for describing identical quantum particles .",
    "let us consider a quantum system composed of @xmath0 particles with spins @xmath1 .",
    "pure states of the whole system are associated to unit vectors in the hilbert space @xmath2 a tensor product of single particle hilbert spaces @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "any particle has two relevant sets of degrees of freedom related to its spin and its position in space .",
    "then , the hilbert space @xmath3 describing the state of the @xmath5-th particle is itself the product of a spin space @xmath6 and a spatial space @xmath7 : @xmath8 if the @xmath5-th particle has spin @xmath9 and is localized in a region @xmath10 , then @xmath11 is a @xmath12 dimensional complex vector space and @xmath13 is the space of square integrable functions on @xmath14",
    ". a pure state of the system is therefore described by a normalized wave function @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17    now let us focus on systems composed of particles of identical nature . according to the previous setting , for a system of @xmath0 identical particles ( same mass @xmath18 and spin @xmath19 ) we have to consider the @xmath0-fold tensor product of identical one - particle hilbert spaces @xmath20 with @xmath21 and , in general , @xmath22 . by indistinguishability",
    "we mean that any property of the composite system has to be invariant under a relabeling of the particles .",
    "such indistinguishability of the quantum particles implies a strong limitation on the possible states of the system : the admissible vectors belong to a proper subspace of @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , let us consider the action of the symmetric group @xmath24 on @xmath23 @xmath25 such @xmath26 s provide a unitary representation of @xmath24 in @xmath27 in the sense that : @xmath28 a relabeling of the @xmath0 particles according to @xmath29 , trasforms the state of the system @xmath30 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : action ] ) .",
    "it turns out that , for @xmath0 identical particles , all unitaries @xmath26 s must leave the state @xmath31 unchanged apart from a constant , @xmath32 , and in @xmath33 there are only two possible values @xmath34 that are consistent with the linearity of quantum mechanics@xcite .",
    "the vector states describing @xmath0 identical bosons belong to the symmetric subspace @xmath35 while those describing @xmath0 identical fermions belong to the antisymmetric subspace @xmath36 notice that the orthogonal projections@xcite @xmath37 map onto the above subspaces : @xmath38    finally , let us spend a few words on the appropriate algebra of observables of system of @xmath0 identical particles .",
    "the outcomes of a measurement of an @xmath0-particle state @xmath39 have to be invariant with respect to any permutation on the state @xmath40 .",
    "this condition imposes that not all operators in @xmath41 ( the algebra of all bounded operators acting on @xmath42 ) are appropriate observables of the system . to be more precise",
    ", the above requirement imposes that for identical particles , an observable @xmath43 must lie on the subalgebra of the _ exchangeable _ operators : @xmath44 a one - particle operator @xmath45 is lifted in a natural way to an observable of @xmath0 identical particles by taking into account condition ( [ eq : exchangeable ] ) .",
    "such a lift is provided by the map ( second - quantization functor ) @xmath46 , whose action is@xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the identity operator on @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to see that the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces are left invariant by the operator @xmath50 .",
    "more generally , the second quantization functor acts in a natural way on any @xmath5-particle operator , with @xmath51 . in this paper",
    "we will make use only of the second quantization of @xmath0-particle operators whose explicit expression is @xmath52 as a particular case , consider @xmath53 where the @xmath54 s act on the spin space @xmath55 , while the identity operators act on the spatial space @xmath56 .",
    "it is easy to verify by inspection that @xmath57 is a projection operator provided that the @xmath54 s are orthogonal projections @xmath58 .",
    "in this section we will show that it is possible to obtain a separable state from a global state describing a system of identical particles under very natural hypotheses .",
    "in particular , we will see that it is sufficient to consider projections for the spatial degrees of freedom with disjoint domains ( i.e. spatially separated particles ) and perform a partial trace in order to obtain a separable quantum state in the spin degrees of freedom . in order to make a first acquaintance with this problem",
    ", we first analyze the case of a system composed by two particles.@xcite    let us recall peres approach to the analysis of entanglement of identical particles@xcite , based on the notion of _ cluster separability_. consider two states @xmath59 and @xmath60 in @xmath49 .",
    "we will say that state @xmath60 is _ remote _ with respect to @xmath59 if @xmath61 is vanishingly small for any operator @xmath62 with support in a spatial neighborhood of @xmath59 .",
    "it follows that any matrix element of @xmath62 involving @xmath60 is vanishingly small .",
    "let us consider a state of two identical particles @xmath63 where the orthogonal states @xmath59 and @xmath60 describe two particles that are far apart . the state of the pair is entangled but this entanglement has no effect if we focus on localized observables .",
    "suppose that the one - particle operator @xmath45 is nonvanishing in a neighborhood of @xmath59 . as a consequence @xmath61 is vanishingly small and then its lifting @xmath64 yields @xmath65 because the terms involving @xmath60 will vanish .",
    "it is now clear that the requirement of spatial separation is the key ingredient underlying the notion of cluster separability .",
    "let us elaborate on this and focus on a system of two identical particles that have both spatial and spin degrees of freedom . as stated in section",
    "[ sec : identical ] , the one - particle hilbert space is @xmath66 while the hilbert space for a system of two bosons ( fermions ) is @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "since we are not dealing with product spaces , we will start from the very definition of the reduced state @xmath69 ( of the spin degrees of freedom ) : @xmath70 where @xmath39 is a generic state in @xmath67 ( or @xmath68 ) , @xmath62 , @xmath71 are two observables acting on spins and @xmath72 , @xmath73 are projections onto the spatial regions @xmath74 and @xmath75 of @xmath33 , where the two spin measurements are respectively performed .",
    "notice that the reduced state will in general depend on the choice of the projections @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spatial_trace ] ) is the sum of two terms @xmath76 the first term can be recast in the form @xmath77 and analogously for the second .",
    "let us consider a pure state @xmath78 with @xmath79 , \\label{eq : state_factor}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 , @xmath81 represent one - particle spin states and @xmath82 , @xmath83 are one - particle spatial wavefunctions such that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "here we suppose that the two spin measurements are located in disjoint regions of the space , @xmath86 so that @xmath87 .",
    "this is in agreement with the standard setting of quantum communication , where alice and bob are spatially separated , whence the wavefunction @xmath82 vanishes outside @xmath74 and , similarly , @xmath83 is zero outside @xmath75 .",
    "plugging this state into eq .",
    "( [ eq : reducedspin ] ) we obtain @xmath88 therefore , from definition  ( [ eq : spatial_trace ] ) one finally gets @xmath89 a pure separable state of the two spins .    in the same way we can start from a generic symmetric or antisymmetric state ( we do not care about normalization ) @xmath90,\\ ] ] and obtain the state @xmath91 which is , in general , mixed and entangled .",
    "we conclude that the structure of @xmath69 is not constrained to satisfy any particular symmetry and it is a generic state of two distinguishable spins in @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the reduced state has no memory of the antisymmetric or symmetric structure of the initial state ( where also the spatial degrees of freedom are considered ) as long as the spin measurements are spatially separated.@xcite under this assumption and considering the spin degrees of freedom , the definition of entanglement for identical indistinguishable particles is not different from the case of distinguishable particles . of course",
    ", if the particles are localized in the same region , @xmath93 , these results are no longer true .",
    "these results can be put in peres framework described at the beginning of this section .",
    "indeed , let us consider the state  ( [ eq : state_factor ] ) of two localized identical particles ( bosons or fermions ) with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the projection operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 onto @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , are mutually orthogonal @xmath87 . in terms of the above notations , state @xmath96 is remote ( in the sense previously defined ) with respect to state @xmath97 and then , for any operator @xmath98 we have @xmath99 therefore , any question about the statistics of the pair is immaterial at the level of the internal ( spin ) degrees of freedom provided the two systems are spatially separated .",
    "the same result can be generalized to a system of @xmath0 identical particles .",
    "indeed we can take a state @xmath31 belonging to @xmath100 for bosons or to @xmath101 for fermions and trace over the spatial degrees of freedom in the way we did for two particles .",
    "this means that we have to consider @xmath0 projections @xmath102 projecting on disjoint spatial regions @xmath103 , corresponding to @xmath0 spatially separated spin experiments .",
    "thus , @xmath104    again we suppose that @xmath39 is a pure state @xmath78 with @xmath105 where @xmath106 for bosons and @xmath107 for fermions .",
    "this leads to @xmath108 so that @xmath109 whence one arrives to the same conclusion as for two indistinguishable particles .",
    "the aim of this section is to better clarify the interplay between indistinguishability of the global wavefunction and entanglement of local states .",
    "recall that the one - particle hilbert space is a product @xmath110 , where @xmath56 is the spin space and @xmath55 the position space . in the previous section we have seen that , whenever some localization precludes the identical particles to share the same spatial state , there is no obstruction on the structure of the reduced state of the internal ( spin ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the spatial separation makes the reduced states insensitive to the quantum statistics of the global state .    to be more clear ,",
    "let us see what happens if the particles share the same spatial state .",
    "let us focus on the fermionic setting @xmath101 .",
    "it will be useful to introduce an orthonormal basis @xmath111 of @xmath55 .",
    "a state @xmath112 whose @xmath0 factors share the same spatial state belongs to @xmath113 which can be considered as a proper subspace of @xmath101 .",
    "the partial trace of a state @xmath114 acting on such a space provides a reduced state with fermionic character : @xmath115 note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : subspace1total ] ) holds also if we consider the subspace , describing a symmetric spatial wavefunction , @xmath116 on the other hand , if the spatial part of the state is antisymmetric , the proper subspace @xmath117 is mapped by the partial trace onto the n - fold symmetric product of @xmath56 : @xmath118 the above three examples should be enough to understand that the statistics of the global state of @xmath0 identical particles can be hidden , preserved or even changed if we focus on the local states of some very particular subspaces .",
    "in this section we will show that our results fit well in other frameworks . in particular we will show that the main claim of the paper is consistent with recent findings related to the definition of separability in the context of identical particles .",

    "( see ref .  )",

    "a pair @xmath120 of commuting unital subalgebras of @xmath119 is defined to be an algebraic bipartition of @xmath119 .",
    "a state @xmath39 on @xmath119 is defined to be separable with respect to the bipartition @xmath120 if for any operator of the form @xmath121 , with @xmath122 belonging to @xmath123 and @xmath124 belonging to @xmath125 , we have @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are states on @xmath119 .",
    "we will show that the requirement of spatial separation of identical particles naturally leads to the bipartition of the algebra of bounded operators , necessary to give a consistent definition of separability .",
    "for the sake of clarity , let us consider two fermions and the algebra of all bounded operators on @xmath68 , with @xmath129 .",
    "the subalgebra of operators concerning the spin degrees of freedom is @xmath130 as in section [ sec : trace ] , we take two projections @xmath131 acting on the spatial space @xmath55 .",
    "let us consider then the subalgebras of @xmath132 defined by : @xmath133 the subalgebras @xmath134 are physically the local subalgebras of ( [ eq : subalg_spin ] ) corresponding to spin measurements by alice and bob , respectively .",
    "our claim is that subalgebras @xmath123 and @xmath125 commutes iff the domains of the projections @xmath72 and @xmath73 do not overlap , namely @xmath135=0 \\qquad\\mathrm{iff } \\qquad pq = qp=0.\\ ] ] indeed , for @xmath136 : @xmath137\\nonumber\\\\ & & = [ p\\otimes a_1\\otimes q\\otimes \\mathbb{i}+q\\otimes \\mathbb{i } \\otimes p\\otimes a_1 , p\\otimes \\mathbb{i}\\otimes q\\otimes a_2]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad + [ p\\otimes a_1\\otimes q\\otimes \\mathbb{i}+q\\otimes \\mathbb{i } \\otimes p\\otimes a_1,q\\otimes a_2 \\otimes p\\otimes \\mathbb{i}]\\nonumber\\\\ & & = qp \\otimes\\mathbb{i } \\otimes pq \\otimes a_1a_2 -    pq \\otimes\\mathbb{i } \\otimes qp \\otimes a_2a_1 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad + pq\\otimes a_1a_2\\otimes qp \\otimes \\mathbb{i } - qp\\otimes a_2a_1\\otimes pq \\otimes \\mathbb{i } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by inspection , this commutator vanishes for any choice of @xmath122 and @xmath124 if and only if @xmath87 , that is iff the particles are spatially separated .    the projection operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 onto @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , are mutually orthogonal @xmath87 .",
    "then , the subalgebras @xmath123 of eq . ( [ eq : localized_subalg ] ) , corresponds to operators @xmath122 in the spin space for particles localized in @xmath74 , and similarly for @xmath125 .",
