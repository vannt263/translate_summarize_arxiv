    "star formation , dust and ultraviolet  ( uv ) and infrared  ( ir ) radiation in galaxies are all closely inter - related .",

    "the ir luminosity of a galaxy is found to be directly proportional to its star - formation rate  ( sfr ) , but the relationship between star - formation and ir luminosity is complicated by uncertainty about dust  @xcite .    the spectra of star - forming galaxies in the mid - infrared  ( mir , @xmath3  3 - 40 ) are generally dominated by five prominent features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3 .",
    "these features are now commonly attributed to small  ( 5 ) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  ( pah ) grains  @xcite in optical - vibrational modes excited by uv and optical photons emitted by b stars  @xcite .",
    "if we can understand the formation , destruction and uv illumination of pah molecules in the interstellar medium  ( ism ) , these features can provide a tracer of star - formation in galaxies without highly uncertain assumptions about dust .",
    "there has been quite a bit of work on pah as tracers of sfr in galaxies  @xcite . however , pah contents in low - luminosity galaxies appear to be exceptional .",
    "interest in the pah emission of low - luminosity systems was motivated by observations of ngc  5253 and ii  zw  40  @xcite .",
    "the pah features are absent from their spectra despite large star - formation rates and substantial dust contents .",
    "a pah deficit is also found in the mir spectrum of sbs  0335 - 052 , one of the most metal - poor galaxies known  @xcite . despite very strong star formation activity , pah features were absent from its mir spectrum  @xcite .",
    "why are these star - forming dwarf galaxies different from star - forming galaxies of higher luminosity ?",
    "the launch of _ spitzer _ space telescope  @xcite , with its unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution , has made it possible for us to make observations of large number of nearby dwarf galaxies . _ spitzer _ studies on individual star - forming dwarf galaxies generally show very weak pah features in their spectra  @xcite .    comparing normal galaxies with",
    "@xmath4  in mir and optical colors , it is clear that visually bluer  ( more star - forming ) objects have stronger pah emission , and visually redder galaxies have weaker pah emission  @xcite .",
    "however , dwarf galaxies mostly appear blue and yet generally have weaker than expected pah emission when compared to normal star - forming galaxies of similar optical color .",
    "this trend has been found in several studies with galaxies selected from _",
    "spitzer _ and optical surveys  @xcite .",
    "are pah molecules truly absent from dwarf galaxies , or does the pah abundance decrease as luminosity or mass decreases ?",
    "what are the causes of this difference in dwarf galaxies ?",
    "are pah molecules destroyed by strong star - forming radiation fields ?",
    "is pah creation or excitation inefficient in these systems because of chemical abundances or for other reasons ? is the geometrical distribution of pah molecules is very different in dwarf galaxies ? or is it due to some other radiative transfer mechanisms that we have not yet understood ?",
    "one of the proposals is that the pah molecules are destroyed in the harsh starburst radiation fields .",
    "these star - forming dwarf galaxies are often at a stage of massive starbursts .",
    "the hard uv radiation emitted by the massive young stars in the low - metallicity regions is capable of destroying small dust grains and pah  @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the mir flux to the far - ir flux ratio of late - type dwarf galaxies decreases as the uv flux increases  @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic study of hii regions in m101 also shows that the equivalent width of the 7.7  pah feature is well correlated with the ionization index , [ neiii]/[neii ]  @xcite .",
    "another related source of destruction could be supernova  ( sn ) driven shocks .",
    "sn explosions occur more frequently per unit stellar mass in these low - luminosity systems  @xcite . using [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ feii]/[neii ] ratios to trace uv radiation hardness and sn contents , @xcite",
    "show that the sn driven shocks are likely to play some role in pah destruction .",
    "another proposed cause is that low - metallicity , specially a lack of carbon , in dwarf galaxies prevents the synthesis of pah molecules .",
    "pah synthesis in the ism may occur through mass - loss winds from asymptotic giant branch  ( agb ) carbon - rich stars  @xcite .",
    "if these blue dwarf galaxies are truly young , there may not be enough time to produce sufficient carbon for pah synthesis in these systems  @xcite .",
    "this explanation maybe be applicable to the low - metallicity dwarf , sbs 0335 - 052 ; the spectrum of sbs 0335 - 052 appears to be dominated by extremely young star - forming episodes  @xcite .",
    "however , a study of 15 local group dwarf galaxies shows evidence against this explanation  @xcite .",
    "all these pah - decifient dwarf galaxies have formed the bulk of their stars more than 2 gyr ago .",

    "this result has been investigated and confirmed by previous optical and mir observations  @xcite . dividing the dwarf galaxies into two luminosity groups , @xmath10  and @xmath51 , the ( pah+dust)/star ratio continues to decrease as the luminosity decreases .",
    "that said , even for the faintest group , the ratio is still higher than the predicted value for a completely ism - free environment .",
    "this result implies the existence of pah molecules or hot dust in these very low - luminosity galaxies . the mechanism behind the deficit of pah emission in dwarf galaxies is uncertain .",
    "it may arise from a mixture of mechanisms , for example , the particular star - formation histories , metallicities and hard radiation fields found in these galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the disentanglement of these effects , however , is difficult , because these properties of dwarf galaxies are themselves closely inter - related .",
    "the relationship between pah emission and the star - formation is intriguing .",
    "the mir spectra of normal star - forming galaxies are , in general , dominated by the pah features and dust continuum .",
    "one of the candidate sources that can excite these mir features is the uv photons emitted by the young and massive stars .",
    "however , the carriers of the 7.7  pah feature are also likely to be destroyed by the hard radiation field in the starburst regions  @xcite .",
    "star - formation , on the one hand , can excite the pah features , but , on the other hand , can also destroy the feature carriers .",
    "fig.([pah_haew ] ) shows that the @xmath28}-{[7.8]}$ ] color and the logarithm of the equivalent width of the h@xmath55 line  ( star - formation rate ) holds a linear relation with a slope of 1.4  per  for normal star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , the relationship between the ( pah+dust)/star ratio and sfr is much weaker for dwarf galaxies of intermediate luminosity and almost gone for dwarf galaxies of very low luminosity .",
    "when the measurement is limited to only the star - forming regions with metallicity near the solar value , the 7.7  pah feature shows an almost linear relationship with the ionizing photon rate , which can be measured with paschen-@xmath55 line  @xcite .",
    "however , the use of the 7.7  feature as a tracer for sfr is very sensitive to the metallicity , the star - formation history , and the size of the galaxy .",
    "although the formation process for pah molecules is still not well understood , if the absence of small - pah features in dwarf galaxy spectra is a problem of formation inefficiency , then a strong dependence of the @xmath28}-{[7.8]}$ ] color on metallicity is expected .",
    "our result in fig.([color_metal ] ) shows that the ( pah+dust)/star increases with increasing oxygen abundance .",
    "in general , this result agrees with the previous mir studies of low metallicity galaxies : observations show that galaxies with low metallicity  ( less than 0.2 solar metallicity ) tend to have lower equivalent widths for emission features at 6.2 , 8 , and 11.2 , which are features from small(@xmath77 ) pah grains  @xcite .",
    "a study of the _ spitzer _ irs low - resolution spectra of 61 sings galaxies fitted with a theoretical dust model , have also shown that , in low metallicity  ( @xmath66 ) galaxies , the fraction of the dust mass contributed by small pahs is 1% in median  @xcite , compared to a more standard fraction of 3.55% at higher metallicity .",
    "so far it is well accepted that the pah features are suppressed in low - luminosity galaxies , which , in general , are metal - poor . with the complete sample of very low - luminosity galaxies presented here",
    ", it is ideal if one can establish a reliable relationship between pah feature strength and metallicity .",
    "although we are limited by the non - negligible uncertainties on the estimates of abundances for the lower - metallicity galaxies , fig.([color_metal ] ) provides evidence that the 7.7  feature is substantially weaker for low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "better abundance estimation is probably not possible without better spectra . for galaxies at such low redshifts , the [ oii]@xmath573726 and [ oii]@xmath573729 lines are well below the minimum wavelength of sdss spectroscopy , so it is impossible at present to estimate the oxygen abundances of these very low - luminosity galaxies with r@xmath78  @xcite .",
    "direct measurement of the electron temperature of the gas with the ionization correction factor  ( icf ) is difficult because the [ oiii]@xmath574363 line is weak  ( only 7 of the 29 very low - luminosity galaxies has s / n@xmath793 in this line ) . to explore in more detail the dependence of the ( pah+dust)/star ratio on metallicity",
    ", it will be important to have reliable metallicity estimates for these metal - poor galaxies .",
    "the absence of pah feature from the low - luminosity galaxy spectra could also be an effect of any pah destruction process .",
    "this is demonstrated by fig.([pah_o3 ] ) , where we show that ( pah+dust)/star ratio is inversely related to the radiation hardness  ( as indicated by @xmath68 ) .",
    "a similar relationship has been found in a previous analysis of 66 starburst galaxies observed in the mir with the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",
    "the equivalent width of the 7.7  pah feature is inversely related to the radiation hardness index  ( a combination of [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ siv]/[siii ] , @xcite ) .",
    "irs observations of 26 blue compact dwarf galaxies  ( bcds ) showed that the equivalent width of the 11.2   and 7.7  pah features are suppressed in harder radiation fields  ( as indicated by [ neiii]/[neii ] , @xcite ) .",
    "the isocam mir spectra of 7 dwarf galaxies show weak small pah features  ( including 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and 12.6 ) and hard radiation fields  ( indicated by [ neiii]/[neii ]  @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of the five pah features  ( 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7 ) in the hii regions of m101 shows that the pah equivalent width relates better to the ionization parameter , ii@xmath80[neiii]/[neii ] , than to the oxygen abundances ; the same behavior is also seen for starburst galaxies including several dwarf galaxies  @xcite .",
    "because there are lower opacities in lower - metallicity hii regions , the photons escaping from the photospheres better preserve their energies ; radiation field tends to be harder in these systems because the photons have not been effectively scattered  @xcite . among the faintest dwarf galaxies  ( @xmath0 )",
    ", there is no significant ( pah+dust)/star  metallicity or ( pah+dust)/star  radiation hardness relation  ( see fig.([color_metal ] ) and fig.([pah_o3 ] ) ) , even though these galaxies span @xmath81  in both parameters .",
    "however , when the very faint galaxies are compared with more luminous dwarfs , we find that the pah emission in dwarf galaxies depends more directly on metallicity .",
    "the left panel of fig.([irc_delta ] ) compares the relationship between the ( pah+dust)/star and the @xmath64 among galaxies of similar radiation hardness .",
    "the dependence of the ( pah+dust)/star on @xmath64 becomes stronger when the radiation in galaxies gets harder .",
    "the right panel compares the ( pah+dust)/star with the radiation hardness of galaxies at similar oxygen abundances .",
    "the dependence of ( pah+dust)/star on radiation hardness is stronger for galaxies of high metallicity , but the ( pah+dust)/star is almost independent of radiation hardness  for metal - poor  ( @xmath82 ) galaxies .",
    "we do not confidently draw the conclusion that the metallicity plays a more important role in the absence of pah for dwarf galaxies for two reasons .",
    "first , the values of @xmath64 in the top plot of fig.([irc_delta])(left ) have more than 0.25  of uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "second , the estimation of @xmath64 itself depends on the @xmath68  ratio . to further disentangle the relationships of the ( pah+dust)/star ratio with metallicity and radiation fields for these very low - luminosity galaxies",
    ", it will be necessary to have independent measurements of the oxygen abundance and the ionization parameter .",
