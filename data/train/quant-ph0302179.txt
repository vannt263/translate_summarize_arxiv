    "the large and rapidly growing field of quantum information science is a vindication of landauer s insistence that we recognize the physical basis of information storage , processing and communication@xcite .",
    "quantum information science is based on the discovery that there are physical states of a quantum system which enable tasks that can not be accomplished in a classical world .",
    "an important example of such a task is quantum teleportation@xcite .",
    "teleportation , like most recent ideas in quantum information science , is based squarely on the physical properties of non - relativistic quantum systems .    recognizing that information science must be grounded in our understanding of the physical world , one is prompted to ask how relativistic considerations might impact tasks that rely on quantum entangled states .",
    "there has recently been some interest in this question for inertial frames .",
    "while lorentz transformations can not change the overall quantum entanglement of a bipartite state@xcite , they can change which properties of the local systems are entangled . in particular , gingrich and",
    "adami@xcite showed that under a lorentz transformation the initial entanglement of just the spin degrees of freedom of two spin half particles can be transferred into an entanglement between both the spin and momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "physically this means that detectors , which respond only to spin degrees of freedom , will see a reduction of entanglement when they are moving at large uniform velocity .",
    "put simply , the nature of the entanglement resource depends on the inertial reference frame of the detectors .",
    "a similar result holds for photons@xcite    in this paper however , we wish to consider quantum entanglement in non - inertial frames . in order to make the discussion physically relevant , we concentrate on a particular quantum information task ; quantum teleportation .",
    "we will show that the fidelity of teleportation is compromised when the receiver is making observations in a uniformly accelerated frame .",
    "this is quite distinct from any reduction in fidelity through the lorentz mixing of degrees of freedom noted by gingrich and adami@xcite .",
    "rather it is direct consequence of the existence of unruh - hawking radiation for accelerated observers . in",
    "so far as teleportation fidelity is an operational measure of quantum entanglement , our results suggest that quantum entanglement may not be preserved in non - inertial frames .",
    "let alice be an inertial minkowski observer with zero velocity , located at the point @xmath0 as shown in .",
    "another inertial observer bob is travelling with positive constant velocity @xmath1 in the @xmath2 direction with respect to alice , and their positions are coincident at the point @xmath0 whereupon they each share one part of an entangled bell state . the textbook teleportation protocol @xcite proceeds as usual with alice sending the results of her measurement to bob at the point @xmath3 , say by photons , so that bob will eventually receive them , and be able to rotate his half of the shared entangled state into the state @xmath4 that alice wishes to teleport ( where the @xmath5 subscripts denotes a minkowski state ) .",
    "the situation is drastically different for the observer rob who travels with constant acceleration @xmath6 in the @xmath2 direction with respect to alice .",
    "alice s and rob s position coincide at the point @xmath0 where again they instantaneously share an entangled bell state , of which rob takes one qubit on his journey . in minkowski",
    "coordinates rob s world line takes the form t_r ( ) = a^-1 , z_r ( ) = a^-1 , where @xmath7 is the proper time along the world line .",
    "rob s trajectory is a hyperbola in minkowski space bounded by the light - like asymptotes @xmath8 and @xmath9 which represents rob s past and future horizons with @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the shaded region in the right half of the minkowski plane in where rob is constrained to move is called the _",
    "right rindler wedge _ ( rrw ) and is labelled with the roman numeral @xmath12",
    ". in general , a point in the rrw can be labelled by the _ rindler coordinates _",
    "@xmath13 which are related to minkowski coordinates @xmath14 by t = , z = , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . lines of constant @xmath17 are hyperbolas within the rrw and lines of constant @xmath18 are straight lines through the origin .",
    "the past horizon @xmath8 corresponds to @xmath19 while the future horizon @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath20 .    with the same coordinate transformation given in , the region @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 is called the _ left rindler wedge _ ( lrw ) and is labeled by the roman numeral @xmath23 . in this region , the lines of constant @xmath18 run in the opposite sense than in @xmath12 .",
    "region @xmath12 is causally disconnected from @xmath23 and no signal from one region can propagate into the other region .",
    "the metric for minkowski space is given by ds^2 = dz^2 - dt^2 = d^2 - ^2 d^2 .",
    "it is well appreciated now @xcite that the quantization of fields in minkowski and rindler coordinates are inequivalent , implying that the rrw vacuum seen by rob @xmath24 is different than the minkowski vacuum seen by alice @xmath25 .",
    "the celebrated result of davies and unruh @xcite is that the minkowski vacuum can be written in terms of the region @xmath12 and @xmath23 states ( for a scalar field ) as = _ , , where @xmath26 with @xmath27 the frequency of a rindler particle .",
    "the minkowski vacuum as given by is a two - mode squeezed state @xcite which for each mode @xmath28 has the general form ~ ^nr , with r = , r = .",
    "note that @xmath25 can be written as @xmath29 where the two - mode squeezing operator is given by @xmath30 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a minkowski state vector is affected by the unitary operator @xmath31 where for a single mode ( ignoring transverse momentum degrees of freedom ) @xmath32 . for rindler states the evolution proceeds via @xmath33 where h_r & & h_i - h_ii + [ 6b ] h_i & = & _ r , h_ii = _ r .",
    "the minus sign in stems from the sense of time essentially flowing `` backwards '' in region @xmath23 ( i.e. for @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a decreasing function of @xmath7 ) .    for rob , who lives in region @xmath12 , all his observables can be written solely in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37 operators .",
    "since he is causally disconnected from region @xmath23 , rob must reduce any density matrix describing both rindler wedges to one appropriate to region @xmath12 only , by tracing out over region @xmath23 .",

    "we will use two - photon states of the electromagnetic field @xcite for the bell state and so must consider fock states , other than the vacuum state , for the rindler observer .",
    "this is easily done by a consideration of how the creation and anihilation operators transform .",
    "the relationship between the minkowski and rindler modes is given by the bogoliubov transformation = d^3 k ( _ kk^ ( ) a_k + _",

    "modes in rindler space are specified by a positive energy rindler frequency @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the bogoliubov transformation can be put into a more transparent form by introducing the _",
    "unruh modes _ @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the unruh modes arise by considering the fourier transform of the usual minkowski plane waves @xmath52^{-1/2}\\exp(\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{x } - \\omegak t)$ ] in terms of the rindler proper time @xmath7 @xcite . these complete , orthonormal set of modes exits over all of minkowski space and can be `` patched together '' to form the two complete orthonormal set of rindler modes which have finite support in either region @xmath12 or region @xmath23 .",
    "the physical significance of the unruh modes is that they diagonalize the generator of lorentz boosts @xcite , which in minkowski coordinates is given by @xmath53 the restriction of the generator of boosts in the @xmath2 direction to region @xmath12 gives the rindler hamiltonian @xmath54 .",

    "finally , the unruh modes are related in a natural way to the rindler modes through the following bogoliubov transformation = with the hyperbolic functions of @xmath56 related to the rindler frequency @xmath48 by .",
    "the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 annihilate the rrw vacuum @xmath59 and lrw vacuum @xmath60 respectively , and commute with each other .    by",
    "we see that a given minkowski mode of frequency @xmath61 is spread over all positive rindler frequencies @xmath48 , as a result of the fourier transform relationship between @xmath62 and @xmath50 .",
    "we now simplify our analysis by considering the effect of teleportation of the state @xmath63 by the minkowski observer alice to a single rindler mode of the rrw observer rob .",
    "that is , we consider only the mode @xmath28 in region @xmath12 which is distinct from the mode @xmath64 in the same region . as such",
    ", we can consider only the @xmath65 contribution and drop the unessential phase factors in .",
    "the single rindler mode component of the minkowski vacuum state we are interested is then ^nr . the relevant bogoliubov transformation can now be written as = r - r . from here on we drop all the frequency and momentum subscripts and replace the labels @xmath66 by @xmath12 and @xmath23 , keeping in mind the full definitions in and .",
    "let us first begin by briefly recalling the usual teleportation protocol , between minkowski observers alice and bob [ ] , as given in @xcite .",
    "our two qubit entangled state will be encoded as entangled fock states of the electromagnetic field .",
    "alice wishes to teleport the state @xmath63 to bob .",
    "let alice and bob share the entangled bell state @xmath67 .",
    "the input state to the system is then @xmath68 .",
    "alice performs a cnot gate on @xmath69 and her portion of @xmath70 , and then passes the first qubit of the output state through a hadammard gate . upon making a joint projective measurement on her two qubits with the result @xmath71 with @xmath72 ,",
    "the full state is projected into @xmath73 where bob s state is given by @xmath74 .",
    "here we have defined the four possible outcomes as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . after receiving the classical information @xmath79 of the result of alice s measurement , bob can rotate his qubit of the entangled state into @xmath69 by applying the operations @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "the fidelity of the teleported state is unity in this idealized situation .",
    "alice now wishes to perform this same teleportation protocol with the uniformly accelerated rob .",
    "the calculation proceeds straightforwardly once we remember two things .",
    "first , the states @xmath82 and @xmath83 of the initial state @xmath84 associated with rob must be expanded in terms of the rindler states @xmath85 .",
    "this can be accomplished by using the single mode minkowski vacuum as given in and the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "here we are imagining the situation where rob has instantaneously accelerated to the value @xmath6 at @xmath86 at the point @xmath0 in where alice and rob initially share the entangle state @xmath70 .",
    "second , since the result of rob s acceleration inextricably creates a particle horizon which keeps him causally disconnected from region @xmath23 , his final state is produced by tracing out over region @xmath23 .",
    "thus , since any minkowski fock state is a correlated state of region @xmath12 and @xmath23 fock states , there is no hope of completely teleporting the state @xmath63 in the presence of this partial trace operation by rob .",
    "however , the best state we might expect rob to obtain as an end product of the teleportation protocol would be the region @xmath12 analogous version of the minkowski transported state @xmath69 , namely = + .",
    "we might call this a _ thermally teleported state _ since rob perceives all minkowski states through the haze of the thermal vacuum that he moves through .",
    "if @xmath87 is rob s density matrix after alice performs the operations on her qubits , then we can measure the fidelity of the thermally teleported state as f^(i ) tr_i(|^(i ) ) = _ i|^(i ) .    using for @xmath25 and for @xmath88",
    "we find = ^nr .",
    "when alice sends the result of her measurement @xmath79 , which can be received by rob , if alice has not yet crossed rob s future horizon @xmath9 , rob s state will be projected into ^(i)_lm & & _ iin _ lm & = & . note that as the acceleration becomes large i.e. @xmath89 , rob s state",
    "is driven into the thermal vacuum state @xmath90 of and all information has been lost due to thermalization .",
    "let us now compute the fidelity in with the state @xmath91 with @xmath92 , which is the penultimate state before rob would perform the appropriate rotation to attempt to transform his half of the ( accelerated ) entangled bell state to its final form @xmath93 .",
    "we obtain f^(i)_lm & = & _ i_lm|^(i)_lm & = & , which is essentially a projection onto the @xmath94 subspace of @xmath87 .     over all possible input states for @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "note that @xmath56 scales directly with the acceleration @xmath6 , so that @xmath97 corresponds to @xmath98.,width=288,height=288 ]    in we plot @xmath99 averaged over all possible input states using the parameterization @xmath95 and @xmath96 . at @xmath97 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath98 , we are back to the case of teleportation between alice and bob in minkowski space , and the fidelity is unity . using the definition of @xmath48 and @xmath56 in we find r & = & r & & r0 . for terrestrial experiments @xmath100 and @xmath101 is such a small frequency , that for all frequencies @xmath27 of physical interest the fidelity is near unity with incredible precision , ( for @xmath102 the fidelity is is unity to within one part in @xmath103 , and this still corresponds to unphysically large accelerations ) .",
    "near the event horizon of a black hole appreciable accelerations can be obtained such that the reduction of the fidelity from unity could be observed . in that case",
    "an analogous teleportation scheme could be defined with rob , stationary , outside the event horizon and alice freely falling into the hole .    in the above",
    "we have ignored the time evolution of the states , namely that alice s qubits evolve according to @xmath31 while rob s qubits evolve via @xmath33 , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "a simple calculation reveals that only change from the above analysis is that @xmath104 in .",
    "however , since the fidelity in depends only upon @xmath105 , this phase factor does not contribute to the final result . from rob s point of view , he is able to receive the result of alice s measurement for all of his eternity , i.e @xmath106 . from alice s point of view ,",
    "she cross rob s future horizon @xmath9 in a finite time @xmath107 , after which even light signals will not reach rob ( see point @xmath3 in ) . for her ,",
    "the teleportation protocol stops since she can no longer communicate the results of her measurements to rob . however , for all of her eternity , i.e. @xmath108 she can still receive persistent requests from rob to send the information .",
    "@xmath9 is analogous to the `` one - way membrane '' of an black hole event horizon , which rob has `` fallen '' through .",
    "it is of some interest to consider the reduction of fidelity in terms of entropy .",
    "in we plot the von neumann entropy @xmath109 of rob s pre - measurement state , post - measurement state upon learning the result of alice s measurement , and the vacuum state , as a function of @xmath56 ( measured in bits ) .",
    "the pre - measurement state is obtained from by summing @xmath110 over all four possible input states , which reduces it to a diagonal density matrix .",
    "the post - measurement state is given by with the input state to the teleportation protocol chosen to be @xmath111 .",
    "for @xmath97 , corresponding to @xmath98 , rob s pre - measurement state is just @xmath112 , half the 2-by-2 unit matrix in the @xmath113 sector ( since @xmath114 in this limit ) and zero elsewhere , while the vacuum is just the normal minkowski vacuum . note that @xmath115 expressing rob s ( or here",
    "bob s at @xmath97 ) complete ignorance of the outcome of alices s measurement . as @xmath56 increases all entropies increase since the thermalization eventually drives all states to the vacuum ( in the limit @xmath89 ) with equally weighted states , where all information is lost .",
    "the energy for this thermalization , of course , comes from the work supplied by the agent causing rob s acceleration .",

    "rob ( or bob ) would absolutely know the state that was teleported to him and thus gain 1 bit of information ( the distance between the solid and dashed curve ) .",
    "however , as the acceleration increases , this information gain decreases from unity to zero as the unruh temperature increases .",
    "this is seen as the solid curve in which plots @xmath118 .    though @xmath119 appears to be levelling out for large @xmath56 in ,",
    "it is doing so only very slowly .",
    "since , as mentioned above , all states are driven to the infinite temperature vacuum as @xmath89 , these curves must eventually merge .",
    "it is curious that they do so slowly .",
    "the dashed curve in is a 2-state model which uses only the ( normalized ) @xmath120 sector of rob s post - measurement state .",
    "the entropies for this two - state model and the vacuum can then be computed analytically and the resulting entropy difference @xmath121 agrees well with the numerical calculation @xmath122 for small values of @xmath123 .",
    "this two state model thermalizes much faster than the full post - measurement state and so approaches zero more rapidly due the finite number of states ( 2 ) used .",
    "the interesting point to note is that even after rob receives alice s classical information about the result of her measurement _ rob is prevented from regaining the full 1 bit of information if his acceleration is non zero_. this is another way to see that from rob s perspective information appears to be lost .     upon receiving the alice s measurement results : numerical ( solid ) and @xmath121 ( dashed ) for a 2-state model using the @xmath120 sector from rob s post measurement state , with @xmath124 .",
    ", width=288,height=288 ]",
    "the main issues of teleportation between an inertial minkowksi observer alice and a non - inertial , uniformly accelerated rindler observer rob are two fold .",
    "first , as a result of the acceleration , the minkowski vacuum that rob moves through ( for a single rindler mode @xmath28 ) can be written as a two - mode squeezed state with the component fock states existing in causally separated regions @xmath12 and @xmath23 .",
    "second , as a result of this fact , rob s perceives the minkowski vacuum as a pure thermal state of temperature @xmath39 as the inevitable result of his complete ignorance of region @xmath23 .    in an attempt to teleport a state @xmath63 to rob ,",
    "the best we can expect rob to recover at the end of the protocol is @xmath125 . in this work",
    "we have calculated the fidelity of the state rob receives with this best possible result @xmath93 .",
    "we have demonstrated how the fidelity decreases with increasing acceleration until at high temperatures all information is lost and rob perceives only the thermalized vacuum state .    the model investigated here is equivalent to teleportation through two channels , one of which is free space for alice and the second which involves parametric down conversion with the following caveat described below . in the second channel , a signal mode @xmath12 and an idler mode @xmath23 experience a squeezing bogoliubov transformation analogous to @xcite . here",
    "@xmath56 is proportional to the coupling strength between the signal and idler mode times the length of the crystal through which the parametric down conversion takes place ; higher interaction strengths and/or longer interaction lengths corresponds to a higher unruh temperature .",
    "the caveat is that rob , acting as say the signal mode , has no access to information about the idler and therefore must trace out this information . performing the teleportation protocol in such a system",
    "is exactly analogous to teleportation between a minkowski and rindler observer as considered in this work . in the parametric down conversion model , rob can choose to ignore the idler information thus mimicking a rindler observer .",
    "however , for an accelerated observer , the existence of the horizons @xmath126 is of fundamental importance . since region @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath23 are causally disconnected , there is no way , even in principle , for rob to have any information about region @xmath23 , and thus his state is always a reduced density matrix appropriate for region @xmath12 .",
    "we have given an explanation of the reduction of teleportation fidelity in terms of the unruh radiation seen by rob in his frame .",
    "note that this is an operationally meaningful statement as rob can attempt to verify that he has not received the desired state @xmath127 by local verification measurements ( e.g. a single photon interference experiment ) , and then send the results to alice",
    ". it would be quite easy to arrange a situation whereby alice could tell unambiguously that rob had received the wrong state . from an operational point of view alice would conclude that the shared entangled resource has become decohered .",
    "it is well know that entanglement is a fragile resource in the presence of environmental decoherence .",
    "it appears also to be a fragile resource when one of the entangled parties undergoes acceleration .",
    "while the degree of decoherence is exceedingly small for practical accelerations , the apparent connection between space time geometry and quantum entanglement is intriguing .    _",
    "added note _ during the preparation of this work , the authors became aware of the recent paper by anderson _",
    "et al _ @xcite which also discusses teleportation and the unruh vacuum",
    ". however , that work considers a physically different situation than the one presented here .",
    "the authors use the _ mirror modes _ of audretsch and mller @xcite and consequently have the accelerated observers travelling on oppositely directed hyperbolas , with alice in region @xmath12 and bob in the causally disconnected region @xmath23 .",
    "the teleportation protocol is then interpreted from the point of view of a minkowski observer mork . in this work ,",
    "we consider a setup between observers , one stationary , the other accelerated , who remain causally connected to each other during the teleportation protocol .",
    "the quantization of field modes discussed this work has actually been carried out for scalar particles .",
