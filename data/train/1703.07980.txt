    "clustering methods are very important techniques for exploratory data analysis with wide applications ranging from data mining @xcite , dimension reduction @xcite , segmentation @xcite and so on .",
    "their aim is to partition data points into clusters so that data in the same cluster are similar to each other while data in different clusters are dissimilar .",
    "approaches to achieve this aim include partitional methods such as @xmath0-means and @xmath0-medoids , hierarchical methods like agglomerative clustering and divisive clustering , methods based on density estimation such as dbscan @xcite , and recent methods based on finding density peaks such as cfsfdp @xcite and ldps @xcite .",
    "image clustering @xcite is a special case of clustering analysis that seeks to find compact , object - level models from many unlabeled images .",
    "its applications include automatic visual concept discovery @xcite , content - based image retrieval and image annotation . however , image clustering is a hard task mainly owning to the following two reasons : 1 ) images often are of high dimensionality , which will significantly affect the performance of clustering methods such as @xmath0-means @xcite , and 2 ) objects in images usually have two - dimensional or three - dimensional local structures which should not be ignored when exploring the local structure information of the images .",
    "to address these issues , many representation learning methods have been proposed for image feature extractions as a preprocessing step .",
    "traditionally , various hand - crafted features such as sift @xcite , hog @xcite , nmf @xcite , and ( geometric ) cw - ssim similarity @xcite have been used to encode the visual information . recently",
    ", many approaches have been proposed to combine clustering methods with deep neural networks ( dnn ) , which have shown a remarkable performance improvement over hand - crafted features @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , these methods can be categorized into two groups : 1 ) sequential methods that apply clustering on the learned dnn representations , and 2 ) unified approaches that jointly optimize the deep representation learning and clustering objectives .    in the first group , a kind of deep ( convolutional ) neural networks , such as deep belief network ( dbn ) @xcite and stacked auto - encoders @xcite , is first trained in an unsupervised manner to approximate the non - linear feature embedding from the raw image space to the embedded feature space ( usually being low - dimensional ) .",
    "and then , either @xmath0-means or spectral clustering or agglomerative clustering can be applied to partition the feature space . however , since the feature learning and clustering are separated from each other , the learned dnn features may not be reliable for clustering .",
    "there are a few recent methods in the second group which take the separation issues into consideration . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed deep embedded clustering that simultaneously learns feature representations with stacked auto - encoders and cluster assignments with soft @xmath0-means by minimizing a joint loss function . in @xcite ,",
    "joint unsupervised learning was proposed to learn deep convolutional representations and agglomerative clustering jointly using a recurrent framework . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed an infinite ensemble clustering framework that integrates deep representation learning and ensemble clustering . the key insight behind these approaches is that good representations are beneficial for clustering and conversely clustering results can provide supervisory signals for representation learning .",
    "thus , two factors , designing a proper representation learning model and designing a suitable unified learning objective will greatly affect the performance of these methods .    in this paper",
    ", we follow recent advances to propose a unified clustering method named discriminatively boosted clustering ( dbc ) for image analysis based on fully convolutional auto - encoders ( fcae ) .",
    "[ fig : dbc ] for a glance of the overall framework .",
    "we first introduce a fully convolutional encoder - decoder network for fast and coarse image feature extraction .",
    "we then discard the decoder part and add a soft @xmath0-means model on top of the encoder to make a unified clustering model .",
    "the model is jointly trained with gradually boosted discrimination where high score assignments are highlighted and low score ones are de - emphasized .",
    "the our main contributions are summarized as follows :    * we propose a fully convolutional auto - encoder ( fcae ) for image feature learning .",
    "the fcae is composed of convolution - type layers ( convolution and de - convolution layers ) and pool - type layers ( pooling and un - pooling layers ) . by adding batch normalization ( bn ) layers to each of the convolution - type layers",
    ", we can train the fcae in an end - to - end way .",
    "this avoids the tedious and time - consuming layer - wise pre - training stage adopted in the traditional stacked ( convolutional ) auto - encoders . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first attempt to learn a deep auto - encoder in an end - to - end manner .",
    "* we propose a discriminatively boosted clustering ( dbc ) framework based on the learned fcae and an additional soft @xmath0-means model .",
    "we train the dbc model in a self - paced learning procedure , where deep representations of raw images and cluster assignments are jointly learned .",
    "this overcomes the separation issue of the traditional clustering methods that use features directly learned from auto - encoders .",
    "* we show that the fcae can learn better features for clustering than raw images on several image datasets include mnist , usps , coil-20 and coil-100 . besides",
    ", with discriminatively boosted learning , the fcae based dbc can outperform several state - of - the - art analogous methods in terms of @xmath0-means and deep auto - encoder based clustering .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . some related work including stacked ( convolutional ) auto - encoders , deconvolutional neural networks , and joint feature learning and clustering are briefly reviewed in section [ sec : related - work ] .",
    "detailed descriptions of the proposed fcae and dbc are presented in section [ sec : fcae - dbc ] .",
    "experimental results on several real datasets are given in section [ sec : experiments ] to validate the proposed methods . conclusions and future works",
    "are discussed in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "stacked auto - encoders @xcite have been studied in the past years for unsupervised deep feature extraction and nonlinear dimension reduction .",
    "their extensions for dealing with images are convolutional stacked auto - encoders @xcite .",
    "most of these methods contain a two - stage training procedure @xcite : one is layer - wise pre - training and the other is overall fine - tuning .",
    "one of the significant drawbacks of this learning procedure is that the layer - wise pre - training is time - consuming and tedious , especially when the base layer is a restricted boltzmann machine ( rbm ) rather than a traditional auto - encoder or when the overall network is very deep .",
    "recently , there is an attempt to discard the layer - wise pre - training procedure and train a deep auto - encoder type network in an end - to - end way . in @xcite , a deep deconvolution network",
    "is learned for image segmentation .",
    "the input of the architecture is an image and the output is a segmentation mask .",
    "the network achieves the state - of - the - art performance compared with analogous methods thanks to three factors : 1 ) introducing a deconvolution layer and a unpooling layer @xcite to recover the original image size of the segmentation mask , 2 ) applying the batch normalization @xcite to each convolution layer and each deconvolution layer to reduce the internal covariate shifts , which not only makes an end - to - end training procedure possible but also speeds up the process , and 3 ) adopting a pre - trained encoder on large - scale datasets such as vgg-16 model @xcite .",
    "the success of the architecture motivates us that it is possible to design an end - to - end training procedure for fully convolutional auto - encoders .",
    "clustering has also been studied in the past years based on independent features extracted from auto - encoders ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , there are attempts to combine the auto - encoders and clustering in a unified framework @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed deep embedded clustering ( dec ) that learns deep representations and cluster assignments jointly .",
    "dec uses a deep stacked auto - encoder to initialize the feature extraction model and a kullback - leibler divergence loss to fine - tune the unified model . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed deep clustering network ( dcn ) , a joint dimensional reduction and @xmath0-means clustering framework .",
    "the dimensional reduction model is based on deep neural networks .",
    "although these methods have achieved some success , they are not suitable for dealing with high - dimensional images due to the use of stacked auto - encoders rather than convolutional ones .",
    "this motivates us to design a unified clustering framework based on convolutional auto - encoders .",
    "in this section , we propose a unified image clustering framework with fully convolutional auto - encoders and a soft @xmath0-means clustering model ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dbc ] ) .",
    "the framework contains two parts : part i is a fully convolutional auto - encoder ( fcae ) for fast and coarse image feature extraction , and part ii is a discriminatively boosted clustering ( dbc ) method which is composed of a fully convolutional encoder and a soft @xmath0-means categorizer . the dbc takes an image as input and exports soft assignments as output .",
    "it can be jointly trained with a discriminatively boosted distribution assumption , which makes the learned deep representations more suitable for the top categorizer .",
    "our idea is very similar to self - paces learning @xcite , where easiest instances are first focused and more complex objects are expanded progressively . in the following subsections , we will explain the detailed implementation of the idea .",
    "traditional deep convolutional auto - encoders adopt a greedy layer - wise training procedure for feature transformations .",
    "this could be tedious and time - consuming when dealing with very deep neural networks . to address this issue",
    ", we propose a fully convolutional auto - encoder architecture which can be trained in an end - to - end manner .",
    "part i of fig .",
    "[ fig : dbc ] shows an example of fcae on the mnist dataset .",
    "it has the following features :    fully convolutional : :    as pointed out in @xcite , the max - pooling layers are very crucial    for learning biologically plausible features in the convolutional    architectures .",
    "thus , we adopt convolution layers along with    max - pooling layers to make a fully convolutional encoder ( fce ) .",
    "since    the down - sampling operations in the fce reduce the size of the output    feature maps , we use an unpooling layer introduced in @xcite to    recover the feature maps . as a result , the unpooling layers along with    deconvolution layers ( see @xcite ) are adopted to make a fully    convolutional decoder ( fcd ) .",
    "symmetric : :    the overall architecture is symmetric around the feature layer . in    practice , it is suggested to design layers of an odd number .",
    "otherwise , it will be ambiguous to define the feature layer . besides ,    fully connected layers ( dense layers ) should be avoided in the    architecture since they destroy the local structure of the feature    layer .",
    "normalized : :    the depth of the whole network grows in @xmath1-magnitude    as the input image size increases .",
    "this could make the network very    deep if the original image has a very large width or height .",
    "to    overcome this problem , we adopt the batch normalization ( bn ) @xcite    strategy for reducing the internal covariate shift and speeding up the    training .",
    "the bn operation is performed after each convolutional layer    and each deconvolutional layer except for the last output layer . as    pointed out in @xcite , bn is critical to optimize the fully    convolutional neural networks .",
    "fcae utilizes the two - dimensional local structure of the input images and reduces the redundancy in parameters compared with stacked auto - encoders ( saes ) . besides , fcae differs from conventional saes as its weights are shared among all locations within each feature map and thus preserves the spatial locality .",
    "once fcae has been trained , we can extract features with the encoder part to serve as the input of a categorizer .",
    "this strategy is used in many clustering methods based on auto - encoders , such as graphencoder @xcite , deep embedding networks @xcite , and auto - encoder based clustering @xcite .",
    "these approaches treat the auto - encoder as a preprocessing step which is separately designed from the latter clustering step . however , the representations learned in this way could be amphibolous for clustering , and the clusters may be unclear ( see the initial stage in fig .",
    "[ fig : procedure ] ) ) .    to address this issue",
    ", we propose a self - paced approach to make feature learning and clustering in a unified framework ( see part ii in fig .",
    "[ fig : dbc ] ) .",
    "we throw away the decoder of the face and add a soft @xmath0-means model on top of the feature layer . to train the unified model ,",
    "we trust easier samples first and then gradually utilize new samples with the increasing complexity . here , an _ easier _ sample ( see the regions labelled 2 , 3 and 4 in fig . [",
    "fig : procedure ] ) is much certain to belong to a specific cluster , and a _ harder _ sample ( see the region 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : procedure ] ) is very likely to be categorized to multiple clusters .",
    "[ fig : procedure ] describes the difference between these samples at a different learning stage of dbc .",
    "there are three challenging questions in the learning problem of dbc which will be answered in the following subsections :    1 .   how to choose a proper criterion to determine the easiness or hardness of a sample ?",
    "2 .   how to transform harder samples into easier ones ? 3 .   how to learn from easier samples ?",
    "we follow dec @xcite to adopt the @xmath2-distribution - based soft assignment to measure the easiness of a sample .",
    "the @xmath2-distribution is investigated in @xcite to deal with the crowding problem of low - dimensional data distributions . under the @xmath2-distribution kernel , the soft score ( or similarity ) between the feature @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and the cluster center @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is @xmath7 here ,",
    "@xmath8 is the degree of freedom of the @xmath2-distribution and set to be @xmath9 in practice .",
    "the most important reason for choosing the @xmath2-distribution kernel is that it has a longer tail than the famous heat kernel ( or the gaussian - distribution kernel ) .",
    "thus , we do not need to pay much attention to the parameter estimation ( see @xcite ) , which is a hard task in unsupervised learning .",
    "we transform the harder examples to the easier ones by boosting the higher score assignments and , meanwhile , bring down those with lower scores .",
    "this can be achieved by constructing an underlying target distribution @xmath10 from @xmath11 as follows : @xmath12    suppose we can ideally learn from the soft scores ( denoted as @xmath13 ) to the assumptive distribution ( denoted as @xmath14 ) each time . then we can generate a learning chain as follows : @xmath15 the following two properties can be observed from the chain :    * property 1 * if @xmath16 for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 , then @xmath19 for all @xmath17 and all time step @xmath2 .    * proof * under the condition , and by ( [ eq : r ] ) we can deduce that @xmath20 . by the chain",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the conclusion @xmath22 follows recursively for all @xmath2 .",

    "thus , @xmath31^{\\alpha^t } = 0,\\;\\;\\forall j\\neq l.\\ ] ] since @xmath32 is finite , we have @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "finally , with the constrains @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath36    * property 1 * tells us that the _ hardest _ sample ( which has the equal probability to be assigned to different clusters ) would always be the hardest one .",
    "however , in practical applications , there can hardly exist such examples . *",
    "property 2 * shows that the initial non - discriminative samples could be boosted gradually to be definitely discriminative . as a result",
    ", we get the desired features for @xmath0-means clustering .",
    "note that the boosting factor @xmath37 controls the speed of the learning process .",
    "a larger @xmath37 can make the learning process more quickly than smaller ones .",
    "however , it may boost some falsely categorized samples too quickly at initial stages and thus makes their features irrecoverable at later stages .",
    "besides , it can be helpful to balance the data distribution at different learning stages . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed to normalize the boosted assignments to prevent large clusters from distorting the hidden feature space .",
    "this problem can be overcome by dividing a normalization factor @xmath38 for each of the @xmath10 .      in the last subsection",
    ", it was assumed that we could learn from @xmath11 to the boosted target distribution @xmath10 .",
    "this aim can be achieved with a joint kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence loss , that is , @xmath39 fig .",
    "[ fig : kl ] gives an example of the joint loss when @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the loss generated by the sample @xmath42 with respect to the @xmath17th cluster ( @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) .",

    "( region 1 ) * for a good categorized sample ( i.e. , there exists an @xmath23 such that @xmath48 ) , its loss will be much greater than zero , and thus it will be treated more seriously .",

    "<S> traditional image clustering methods take a two - step approach , feature learning and clustering , sequentially . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent research results demonstrated that combining the separated phases in a unified framework and training them jointly can achieve a better performance . in this paper , we first introduce fully convolutional auto - encoders for image feature learning and then propose a unified clustering framework to learn image representations and cluster centers jointly based on a fully convolutional auto - encoder and soft @xmath0-means scores . at initial stages of the learning procedure </S>",
    "<S> , the representations extracted from the auto - encoder may not be very discriminative for latter clustering . </S>",
    "<S> we address this issue by adopting a boosted discriminative distribution , where high score assignments are highlighted and low score ones are de - emphasized . with the gradually boosted discrimination , clustering assignment scores are discriminated and cluster purities are enlarged . </S>",
    "<S> experiments on several vision benchmark datasets show that our methods can achieve a state - of - the - art performance .    </S>",
