    "in a recent paper @xcite , we have studied a homogeneous non - equilibrium system @xmath0 surrounded by an extremely large medium @xmath1 .",

    "we apply the _ second law _ to the isolated system to describe the behavior of the non - equilibrium system @xmath0 .",

    "are _ constant _ in time .",
    "these observables also identify the macrostate of @xmath11 .",
    "it is clear that for some homogeneous @xmath11 , the variation of its instantaneous entropy @xmath21  can not be explained by the dependence of the latter on its constant observables .",
    "the variation can only be explained by assuming the dependence of @xmath21 on ( additive ) internal variables , variables that can not be controlled by the observer , that vary in time as @xmath21 approaches its maximum value . for an inhomogeneous @xmath11 , the variation of its entropy @xmath21  can be explained by the way the inhomogeneity disappears @xcite as it approaches equilibrium .",
    "the inhomogeneity gives rise to induced internal variables ; see below .",
    "one may not require any additional internal variable .",
    "thus , if we consider @xmath11 to consist of @xmath0 and @xmath22 , as we do in this work , it is no longer a homogeneous system as long as @xmath0 is not in equilibrium with the medium @xmath1 .",
    "thus , it is possible to consider  @xmath11 without any internal variable , as was the case studied in @xcite .",

    "the behavior appears to be the right behavior for the entropy in an isobaric process as the entropy must be an increasing function of the enthalpy with the slope given by@xmath37 see eq .",
    "( [ ds / dh_relation ] ) ; it is well known that the enthalpy falls ( rises ) during isobaric cooling ( heating ) @xcite .",
    "the analysis in our previous work @xcite is carried out for any non - equilibrium system .",

    "one can understand the drop @xmath43 in the entropy of glass2 during a glass transition , provided the entropy of the medium goes up by @xmath44 to compensate the loss and some more so that the entropy of @xmath11 does not decrease@xmath45 during the glass transition .",
    "however , the authors have not discussed this issue at all .",
    "this is not surprising as they neither include any medium in their discussion nor do they consider an isolated system for which eq .",
    "( [ second_law ] ) holds .",
    "we will always consider @xmath0 as a part of the isolated system @xmath11 and apply eq .",

    "_ as the entropy change of the medium is completely reversible , its evaluation will not suffer from any irreversibility going on in _",
    "@xmath11__. _ _ this is the major benefit of investigating a glass as part of @xmath11 .",
    "both glasses begin to deviate from the equilibrium supercooled liquid at @xmath46 , but their structures are not yet `` frozen ; '' they freeze over a long period of time ( @xmath47 ) at a lower temperature @xmath48 to form an amorphous solid , to be identified as a glass ( glass1 and glass2 ) .",
    "the location of @xmath46  is determined by the choice of @xmath49 ; indeed , @xmath46 decreases with increasing @xmath49 . over the transition region between these two temperatures ,",
    "the internal variables gradually change form their equilibrium values at @xmath46 to their frozen values at @xmath48 .    in the absence of any internal variable ,",
    "fixing the temperature and pressure fixes the instantaneous state .",
    "as the uca glass ( glass2 ) is homogeneous and has the same constant temperature and pressure as the medium .",
    "it appears then that there can not be any heat transfer between @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "if true , then during an isothermal relaxation ( constant @xmath33 of the medium under isobaric condition ) , the first law with @xmath50 and no internal variables yields@xmath51 this implies that @xmath52 during relaxation , which is most certainly not a rule in glasses .    another important aspect of glass transition , as has become apparent from recent work , is the violation of the principle of detailed balance and of the fluctuation disspation theorem @xcite , such as the equivalence of the heat capacity with enthalpy fluctuations .",
    "but the theorem is shown to be valid in uca @xcite , which is quite surprising .",
    "faced with these hard to understand consequences and the conflict with our own results , we decided to examine the basic assumptions in the unconventional approach .",
    "these assumptions , to the best of our reading of their work , are not properly and adequately justified so far by gmc . in many cases ,",
    "they are simply stated as facts alongside several statements that are either exaggerations or are outright false .",
    "therefore , we will treat them as conjectures and investigate whether we can justify them either rigorously or on physical grounds .",
    "we defer to the next section these conjectures and the role they play in the logical development of uca .",
    "we should mention at this point that some aspects of uca have already been criticized by other authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , goldstein @xcite , see also @xcite , demonstrated that the entropy loss during the glass transition violates the second law . to this gmc responded by suggesting that the process of glass formation is not governed by the second law @xcite .",
    "this is a surprising response ( as the second law is supposed to govern all processes ) , but quite understandable as gmc have a very unconventional view of the second law .",
    "we do not get into this debate by avoiding the issue altogether .",
    "we focus on an isolated system @xmath11 , where there can not be any dispute about the second law ; see eq .",
    "( [ second_law ] ) . in that sense ,",
    "our work differs from other attempts @xcite . in our investigation , which is at a fundamental level , we look at all the underlying assumptions of uca to see if they can be justified so that uca could become an acceptable theory .",
    "we only consider the thermodynamic entropy during this part of our investigation , so we do not get confused by which statistical entropy formulation is appropriate to study vitrification .",
    "once , we settle the issues by using the thermodynamic entropy , we turn to the statistical formulation of entropy to assess the notion of statistical entropy gmc have advocated .",
    "it is our belief that the unconventional view of the second law and of the statistical entropy form the basis of uca , which has been justified in various publications by following the logical steps listed below :    1 .",
    "the use of equilibrium thermodynamics using calorimetric data can not determine the entropy of the glass .",
    "thus , there is no reason for the residual entropy to exist at absolute zero .",
    "the entropy of a single microstate is zero .",
    "as a glass is in one microstate at absolute zero , its entropy must be zero in accordance with the third law .",
    "the glass undergoes spontaneous relaxation during which the entropy increases and reaches that of the equilibrated supercooled liquid given by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] from below .",
    "the entropy drop due to the loss of ergodicity and the spontaneous relaxation with entropy increase are , therefore , inverse processes .",
    "a calculation method for the entropy is developed to show drop in the entropy during the glass transition region , see glass2 in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] so that the calculated entropy shows no residual entropy at absolute zero .",
    "it is important to understand their final conclusion , the so - called inverse relationship ( uca5 ) and to see if it , and all of its underlying assumptions ( uca1-uca4 ) , are consistent with the second law , the only fundamental law of nature that is accepted by all including gmc .",
    "various conjectures leading to uca5 seem not to be adequately answered so far by gmc .",
    "this deficiency by itself does not mean that uca is unfounded , but it does mean that it requires closer scrutiny , which forms the basis of this investigation .",
    "these authors invariably consider their system @xmath0  ( the glass ) at fixed @xmath33 and @xmath32 , which means that it is _ not _ an isolated system ; rather , it is surrounded by @xmath1 ; see fig . [ fig_systems ] .",
    "( in the following , we will call their system @xmath0 an open system , knowing very well that this is not the customary usage .",
    "we believe that this will not cause any confusion . ) as gmc constantly appeal to the second law in terms of the entropy of the system , the most convenient way to examine their approach is to focus on the isolated system @xmath11 in which the glass will be a possible state of the system @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to examine their approach at the most fundamental level .",
    "we summarize our conclusions that follow from the application of the second law in terms of entropy to an isolated system .",
    "we only consider vitrification in the rest of the work .",
    "we agree with uca1 , but we find uca2 unsubstantiated . indeed , we find the calorimetrically obtained @xmath53 forms a _ lower bound _ to the entropy @xmath54 so that the residual entropy has a lower bound @xmath53 at absolute zero .",
    "the latter entropy is usually non - negative , so that the residual entropy must be even larger than this .",
    "such a glass can not satisfy the third law , which leads to uca3 being invalid .",
    "indeed , if there is ever any conflict between the second and the third law , it is the former that supersedes . in an isothermal relaxation",
    ", the entropy actually decreases towards the equilibrated supercooled liquid entropy , thus invalidating uca4 .",
    "however , the irreversible entropy generation remains non - negative in accordance with the second law .",
    "gmc do not recognize the importance of the irreversible entropy generation for the second law and mistakenly ascribe its _ universal _ non - negative _ _ aspect to the entropy of the system .",
    "following uca , we find that @xmath55 all times including @xmath56 , when the external condition ( such as the temperature ) of the system is changed .",
    "this is inconsistent with uca5 .",
    "even if we follow uca conjecture [ marker_microstate ] , see sect .",
    "[ sect_uca_conjectures ] , although it is inconsistent with the first part , we find that the entropy now increases at @xmath56 and reaches that of glass2 at @xmath57 ; the glass transition occurs at this instant if the external condition of the system is disturbed somehow .",
    "if it is not disturbed , the entropy would continue to increase .",
    "thus the entropy is always increasing for @xmath58 in uca . in both cases",
    ", we do not find that there is any justification in calling the glass transition and relaxation to be inverse processes in uca .",
    "thus , uca5 is not a consequence of the previous steps uca1-uca4 .",
    "just because gmc have provided a computational scheme to support their invalid conclusion can not be considered a proof of the validity of uca .",
    "we find that uca misses out many important aspects of non - equilibrium systems such as their temperature , pressure , etc .",
    "being different from those of the medium , absence of any internal variables to capture additional irreversible entropy generation , the failure of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem etc .",
    "as the recent work from gmc is expected to represent their most up - to - date and current state of understanding of various issues , we will mostly focus on their recent work @xcite for an understanding of the technical aspect of their approach , the cornerstone of which is that it treats structural relaxations as the _ inverse _ of the glass transition @xcite :    [ marker_inverse]the inverse of the glass transition is structural relaxation , which involves a restoration of ergodicity as a glass spontaneously approaches the liquid state .",
    "this spontaneous relaxation process is called a unifying process and must entail an increase in entropy as the observation time constraint is lifted .    the decrease in entropy during glass transition to that of glass2",
    "is justified on the basis of a seemingly innocuous conjecture about the effect of confinement to an ergodic component stated as a _",
    "@xcite :    [ marker_entropy_loss]the loss of ergodicity at the glass transition necessarily involves a loss of configurational entropy , since this causes the system to be confined to a subset of the overall phase space . at absolute zero ,",
    "any glass is confined to one and only one microstate , so the configurational entropy of a glass is necessarily zero , in accordance with the third law and the principle of causality .    in vitrification , the entropy does decrease .",
    "this is most clearly seen by quenching the supercooled liquid from a temperature just above @xmath46 to a below @xmath46 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] .",
    "the decrease is shown by the dashed downward arrow to b , which represents the entropy of glass1 that stays above @xmath35 . a similar drop of much higher value occurs for glass2 .",
    "both glasses seem to conform to the first part of the conjecture .",
    "therefore , this part can not be the defining characteristics of ergodicity loss or uca .",
    "it is merely a consequence of a positive heat capacity and nothing more and has nothing to do with ergodicity loss .  whether the loss is big enough to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ entropy_behavior_uca ] ) is never demonstrated as they have not calculated the entropy gain @xmath59 of the medium .",
    "the second half of the conjecture requires the entropy to vanish at absolute zero , so the entropy of the uca glass is given by the dashed curve glass2 in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] and not by the dotted curve glass1 .",
    "thus , uca requires the entropy to drop below @xmath35 of the equilibrated supercooled liquid and requires evaluating @xmath59 to substantiate it .",
    "this part of the conjecture is based on the following conjecture @xcite :    [ marker_microstate ]  an instantaneous measurement  causes the system to collapse  into a single microstate @xmath60 with probability @xmath61 . in the limit of zero observation time , the system is confined to one and only one microstate and the observed entropy is necessarily zero .",
    "however , the entropy becomes positive for any finite observation time @xmath49  since transitions between microstates are not strictly forbidden except at absolute zero , barring quantum tunneling .",
    "the conjecture refers to a system `` collapsing '' into one out of _ many _ microstates and asserts as a fact that _ the entropy of a microstate is identically zero _ without any supporting justification .",
    "this creates some conceptual problems . at each instant of time @xmath16 , any system , not necessarily a glass only , is going to be in some microstate @xmath62 ; of course , we do not know which microstate it would be in at that instance .",
    "if we make `` an instantaneous measurement , '' the system will remain in that microstate ; there is no `` collapse '' of the microstate .",
    "even the macrostate , which is by definition the collection of all relevant microstates along with their probabilities , does not have time to change , because the probability distribution @xmath61 does not change .",
    "indeed , one does not need to make any measurement on the system to conclude ``  _ the system to collapse into a single microstate  _. '' at each instance , the system is going to be in some microstate .",
    "if we interpret a measurement as something that instantaneously alters the external condition such as the fields of the medium , then such an instantaneous move ( measurement ) will probe the instantaneous microstate of the system .",
    "the statistical entropy of the system @xmath55 at each instant , and therefore at all times , in accordance with conjecture [ marker_microstate ] .",
    "this is true even if the system is an isolated system not in equilibrium .",
    "this concept of statistical entropy in uca is in direct contradiction with the second law in eq .",
    "( [ second_law ] ) according to which the thermodynamic entropy @xmath21 is not constant in time .",
    "thus , the conjecture needs some justification , which gmc have not provided so far . in particular ,",
    "it allows us to make the following    [ marker_remark_gmc_entropy]_the statistical concept of entropy used by gmc in the above conjecture has nothing to do with the thermodynamic entropy used in eq .",
    "( [ second_law ] ) . _",
    "another conceptual problem is that the statistical entropy is defined for a macrostate as an _ average _ quantity over all microstates ; see eq .",
    "( [ gibbs_entropy ] ) .",
    "if it happens that a certain macrostate consists of a single microstate whose probability must be @xmath63 , then the statistical entropy of that macrostate such as a completely ordered crystal is certainly zero .",
    "but what does one mean by the statistical entropy , an average quantity , of a microstate ? what averaging does one perform for a microstate ?",
    "this issue is never addressed by gmc except by the above conjecture and by an appeal to the boltzmann entropy formulation @xmath64 ( we set @xmath65 ) , which requires the number of microstates @xmath66 forming the macrostate .",
    "this is evident from @xcite    [ marker_boltzmann]  boltzmann s definition of entropy is the only one valid and consistent with the second law for non - equilibrium system .",
    "they take @xmath67 for a single microstate at all temperatures , even if there may be other possible microstates , and argue for zero entropy .",
    "thus , the instantaneous statistical entropy will always be zero at all times and at all temperatures since the system is in a single microstate at each instant .",
    "the idea of introducing an instantaneous measurement is highly appropriate as we need to measure instantaneous values of the observables .",
    "no measuring apparatus will ever measure the instantaneous entropy ; its value can only be inferred indirectly .",
    "thus , entropy is not an observable in the same sense as the mechanical variables such as energy , volume , etc .",
    "are ; it is a thermodynamic quantity , which has been given a statistical interpretation in statistical mechanics . despite this , gmc argue that , when the measurement takes some non - zero time , the statistical entropy increases with the duration of measurement .",
    "however , gmc never clarify if the measurement gives an accumulated value or the average value of any quantity .",
    "the first option is counter - intuitive as this suggests that the value of the energy by such a measurement will increase with the duration of the measurement .",
    "the second option seems reasonable as the value of the measurement will give an average energy .",
    "this then suggests that , since at each instant during the measurement , the system is in a single microstate so that its entropy is zero , the measurement will still result in a zero entropy .",
    "why does it increase ?",
    "even if we adopt the first option , then the `` measured '' entropy would still be zero as accumulating zero always gives zero .",
    "no explanation is offered by gmc for this part of the conjecture . recall that one can not appeal to the second law , which uses the thermodynamic entropy , while gmc use their statistical entropy",
    "whose equivalence with the thermodynamic entropy is never shown by them .",
    "we have addressed this issue elsewhere @xcite with a very different conclusion .",
    "we find , see sect .",
    "[ sect_statistical_entropy ] , that the statistical entropy contribution of a microstate @xmath60  is @xmath68 , which is inconsistent with the above conjecture .  thus , we need to understand the basis of their conjecture .",
    "this conjecture is amplified by the following two inter - connected conjectures @xcite :    [ marker_boltzmann_spontaneous]with boltzmann s definition , the entropy increases during a spontaneous process .",
    "[ marker_glass_nonspontaneous]if entropy increases during the relaxation process and the glass transition is the inverse of relaxation , then entropy must decrease during the glass transition .",
    "this is consistent with our previous conclusion that the glass transition is nonspontaneous .",
    "while this conclusion may appear as inconsistent with the second law , there is no violation since the second law is a statement about spontaneous processes , i.e. , processes in which a system relaxes toward an equilibrium or less constrained state .",
    "the glass transition is not such a process since here an equilibrium system becomes a constrained equilibrium state .",
    "conjecture [ marker_boltzmann_spontaneous ] is not only inconsistent with conjecture [ marker_microstate ] , it is inconsistent with classical thermodynamics when we consider a system which is not isolated .",
    "for such a system , its relevant free energy decreases in any spontaneous process .",
    "it appears that gmc confuse isothermal relaxation occurring in a glass with spontaneous processes occurring at fixed observables such as energy , volume , etc .",
    "the latter processes occur for isolated systems , not for a glass at fixed temperature and pressure .",
    "if gmc insist on focusing on the entropy , then the statement should be in terms of the irreversible entropy generation @xmath69 , not in terms of the entropy change @xmath70 .",
    "thus , for the conjecture to make sense , the reversible entropy drop @xmath71 during vitrification must not be too negative to ensure @xmath72 .",
    "this requires a justification that@xmath73 for the conjecture to be valid .",
    "however , no such justification is offered by gmc in their work . as given",
    ", it gives the impression that uca treats entropy to increase during relaxation in all kinds of systems , isolated or not .",
    "this is unsettling .",
    "the same problem occurs with the last conjecture .    therefore , to determine whether the above conjectures are justifiable , we turn to the second law for @xmath11 .",
    "the second law does tell us that the irreversible entropy generation in any spontaneous process is non - negative , but leaves the behavior of the entropy undetermined ; the latter depends on the process .",

    "we find nothing wrong with the gibbs formulation , contrary to the implications in uca .",
    "the suggestion by gmc that the glass confined to a component is like a canonical system at fixed temperature and volume ( while it is really a non - canonical system with time - varying temperature and constant pressure ) misses out the most important aspect of the glass transition .",
    "the temperature controlling the vibrations within the component and the temperature describing component hopping over a longer period of time are two distinct temperatures .",
    "as they do not include any internal variable in their approach , they miss out in capturing all non - equilibrium contributions to the problem .",
    "all they seem to be concerned with is to justify the loss of entropy using a computational approach . proposing a computational approach that shows entropy of the glass below that of the supercooled",
    "liquid is not a proof of the conjecture of the entropy loss .",
    "we need to ensure that the resulting physics is consistent with the established laws of physics , such as the second law .",
    "we now turn to this aspect of their approach .      when the entropy is given by eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann_entropy ] ) , the system is said to be _",
    "ergodic_. a system is either ergodic or it is not . when the entropy is given by eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann_entropy(t ) ] ) , one can say that the system is `` ergodic with respect to the available microstates belonging to @xmath66 . ''",
    "but this is not equivalent to the original concept of ergodicity , which is mathematically defined @xcite by requiring the equality of infinite time and ensemble or phase - space averages ; see also tolman @xcite:@xmath208 where @xmath209 the infinite - time average is required to ensure that the average does not depend on the initial state of the system .",
    "thus , the deborah number@xmath210 if we wish to test whether a given system is ergodic or not .",
    "if we observe a system over a period much shorter than @xmath182 , so that @xmath211 , all we observe is a non - equilibrium system , but it tells us nothing about the system being ergodic or not .",
    "that can only be answered by observing a system much much longer than @xmath182 ; indeed this time must be comparable to the poincar cycle .",
    "even if we observe the system for a period @xmath16 comparable to @xmath182 , the system has not have enough time to visit all relevant microstate . in this case,@xmath212",
    "will be dominated by microstates that the system has visited during @xmath213 ; but these microstates have a strong correlation with the initial state , which may be far from equilibrium .",
    "thus , such a finite time - average will not be equal to the ensemble average @xmath214 for the system , and one would incorrectly conclude that the system is non - ergodic , even if it is ergodic .",
    "it should be clear that because of the limit @xmath215 , ergodicity is a property of an equilibrium state .",
    "it has no meaning for a non - equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , any suggestion that a glass is non - ergodic requires the _ phenomenological assumption _ that it is a permanently frozen structure .",
    "this is most certainly not a valid assumption in the glass transition region .",
    "thus , to speak of ergodicity breaking at or near @xmath46 is a misnomer in our opinion , even though it is loosely used in the literature .    in practical terms , a system is ergodic  if , after _ sufficiently long _",
    "time @xmath216 , it visits all possible microstates consistent with a macrostate with _",
    "equal probability_. this is no different than the above mathematical definition , as the time required to visit all microstates is comparable to the poincar cycle @xcite .",
    "however , the practical definition , which uses the macrostate , causes the following problem .",
    "it depends on how the macrostate is defined . as we have seen in sect .",
    "[ sect_second_law ] , the concept of a macrostate in non - equilibrium systems depends on time and will eventually become the equilibrium macrostate when @xmath217 .",
    "this will make every system ergodic , whether the equilibrium state is unique or not , such as an ising ferromagnet which has two distinct equilibrium states , and for which the macrostate can be described by the magnetization along with other observables .",
    "if , however , the magnetization is not used in specifying the macrostate , then the practical definition will show that the ergodicity is broken in ferromagnets .",
    "usually , we require the equilibrium state to be not unique for the loss of ergodicity .",
    "therefore , we believe that the mathematical definition of ergodicity as a limiting property is the proper way to investigate ergodicity . such a definition will surely make the liquid above the melting temperature ergodic .",
    "now , just because we observe an ergodic system such as this liquid at some time @xmath218 , so that we observe a non - equilibrium state of the system , does _ not _ make the ergodic system non - ergodic .",
    "the system remains ergodic as it will eventually equilibrate to its unique equilibrium state for @xmath217 in accordance with its ergodic nature .",
    "therefore , to speak of ergodicity restoration for a glass is not proper as the glass fully relaxes . from the proper mathematical definition of ergodicity , a glass is also `` ergodic '' as it will eventually equilibrate to the unique equilibrated supercooled liquid .",
    "the quotation marks on ergodic here is to reflect the fact that we are taking the corresponding crystal out of the consideration .",
    "these issues have been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "palmer @xcite does talk about the loss of ergodicity , but it is understood that the relevant part of the phase space is a union of _ disjoint _ components with no possible transitions between them ; the union of these components determine the macrostate .",
    "however , the system will be confined _ forever _ to one of these components , so that we can set @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "the situation is similar to that in a ferromagnet , except that there are many more macrostates considered by palmer .",
    "the ergodicity is clearly lost in this case . however , the situation with glasses is quite different since @xmath221 so that @xmath222 in the limit .",
    "we believe that gmc unnecessarily complicate the issue of glass transition by invoking the loss of ergodicity just because we happen to observe the system in its non - equilibrium state at time intervals @xmath218 .",
    "if we accept this rendition of ergodicity loss , even a liquid above its melting temperature will become non - ergodic at @xmath218 , and no useful purpose is served by introducing such a concept of ergodicity .",
    "we refer the reader to a very good discussion of ergodicity by tolman @xcite and by gallavotti ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see , in particular , p. 257 ) .",
    "in our view , the glass transition at @xmath46 is a transition from equilibrated supercooled liquid to a non - equilibrium supercooled liquid and the transition at @xmath48 a transition from this non - equilibrium supercooled liquid to a glass , which is almost solid and its structure appears frozen over a long period of time ( @xmath47 ) .",

    "the entropy is _ always increasing _ , with the glass transition playing no special role in the growth of the entropy .",
    "we see no evidence of this process being inverse of the glass transition at @xmath253 ; entropy @xmath8 is an increasing function of @xmath16 at all times :    we see no real difference in the way entropy behaves during the evolution of the system , which suggests that the glass transition and relaxation are not inverse processes .",
    "regardless of the amount of drop ( it does not even have to be comparable to @xmath260 ) , the statistical entropy @xmath41 of such a non - equilibrium state in uca must approach that of the supercooled liquid from below .",

    "thus , the statistical entropy @xmath8 and the thermodynamic entropy @xmath3 are two distinct quantities , with the statistical entropy @xmath8 having no relevance to the glassy state .",
    "we believe that the core of the problem with uca is the conjecture about the entropy of a microstate ; see conjecture [ marker_microstate ] .",
    "the entropy is a property of a macrostate .",
    "however , if the system is in internal equilibrium or in equilibrium , then one can obtain the entropy of the system by simply using a microstate @xcite , as seen in eq .",

    "[ sect_measurement ] . the dynamics within a glass for it to jump from one microstate to another in time is not necessary for determining these instantaneous averages , an issue discussed elsewhere @xcite to which we refer the reader for details .",

    "does not mean that the glass entropy is zero .",
    "the latter would be the case if we knew which particular microstate the glass sample happens to be .",

    "all we know is that the probability that the system is in microstate @xmath60 is @xmath261 , and the entropy is given by the gibbs entropy in eq .",
    "( [ gibbs_entropy ] ) .",
    "there is another way to understand this probability @xcite .",
    "we consider dividing the system into a large number of macroscopically large but quasi - independent parts of equal size , each of which can be in any microstate @xmath269 associated with a part with a probability @xmath270 .",

    "once we recognize that the entropy of a microstate is in general not zero identically , we have no problem understanding that when we bring the system in contact with a medium at another temperature , the entropy immediately after the contact is also unchanged .",
    "it then changes towards the new equilibrium value during its relaxation , which is shown by downward arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig_entropyglass ] .",
    "if we interrupt this relaxation at @xmath276 ( @xmath125 ) by bringing the system in contact with a different medium at a lower temperature , the system will not completely relax .",
    "the current value of the entropy @xmath277 becomes the initial value of the entropy at the new temperature .",
    "a sequence of such interruptions will eventually result in a `` frozen '' glass below @xmath48 .",
    "this understanding of the microstate entropy also shows that one does not have to observe the system over a period necessary to sample _ many _ of or _ all _ of the microstates associated with the macrostate or one does not require that the entropy is maximum only when all the microstates have been visited .",
    "the latter understanding of entropy has been criticized in the past by several authors ; see for example huang @xcite , tolman @xcite , gallovatti @xcite , gujrati @xcite , and the argument has been revisited recently by goldstein @xcite : the time needed for _ all _ the microstates of a macroscopic system to be visited so that the entropy becomes maximum is beyond the current age of the universe . we have already argued against the time - average to be relevant for any measurement @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have shown clearly that a single instantaneous measurement is sufficient to provide us with a thermodynamic description of the system at that instant .",
    "any measurement that takes some finite non - zero duration will never yield any instantaneous information about the system .",
    "we have briefly described and extended the conventional approach we have developed earlier for any non - equilibrium system .",
    "we consider the system @xmath0 to be surrounded by a very large medium @xmath1 to form the combined system @xmath11 so that the fields of the medium are not affected by the presence of processes going on inside the system , whatever they may .",
    "thus , the approach can be applied to glasses ; some authors sometimes identify them by some stretch of imagination as non - ergodic . however , whether ergodicity is lost or not plays no role in the behavior of the collection @xmath278 which we treat as an isolated body so that its thermodynamic entropy can not decrease with time .",
    "this is the statement of the second law for the isolated body .",
    "we assume that both the body and the medium are separately in internal equilibrium , but not in equilibrium with each other .",
    "the internal equilibrium allows us to introduce instantaneous fields @xmath30 , etc . for the system and the constant fields @xmath29 , etc . for the medium .",
    "we also use a single internal variable @xmath85 , in addition to @xmath279 as induced internal variables , to describe possible relaxation in the system as it approaches equilibrium .",

    "the irreversible entropy generation requires @xmath168 ; the equality occurs when there is equilibrium between the system and the medium .",
    "the instantaneous observables , internal variables and entropy at time @xmath16 are described by the microstate @xmath62 the system happens to be in at that instance along with its probability .",
    "this microstate also represents the instantaneous macrostate of the system .",
    "the effect of an instantaneous measurement is to give the values of the instantaneous observables and the entropy .",
    "the measurement does not alter the instantaneous value of the observables , internal variables , and the entropy .",
    "the entropy above refers to the _ thermodynamic entropy _ and its statistical interpretation is obtained by the gibbs entropy formualtion : the _ statistical entropy _ is a statistical average of the negative index of microstate probabilities , just like the observables are of mechanical quantities . in our approach ( ca ) , the two entropies behave in identical fashion .",
    "any attempt to provide the classical entropy with a statistical interpretation must satisfy two important requirements :      in our approach , any non - equilibrium state , such as the one produced by changes in the medium by changing its temperature , relaxes towards its new equilibrium . during such a relaxation under isobaric cooling , the entropy , ehthalpy and the instantaneous temperature decrease towards their respective equilibrium values .",
    "the relaxation is complete when we wait for @xmath280 . during the relaxation process",
    ", the system will undergo a glass transition below @xmath46 , if the system is abruptly changed at @xmath281 by bringing it in contact with a medium at a lower temperature .",
    "the _ instantaneous macrostate _ of the system , described in terms of its observables and internal variable , does not change when the contact is made .",
    "this also means that the entropy also does not change .",
    "if the contact is not made , the relaxation will continue to go on .",
    "thus , the glass transition and relaxation are part of the same relaxation process in ca .",
    "there is nothing inverse about them . the gain in the thermodynamic entropy of the medium is shown to be bounded from above by the maximum change @xmath282 ;",
    "the latter is the maximum possible decrease in the thermodynamic entropy of the system . from a careful analysis ,",
    "we have concluded that the thermodynamic entropy @xmath3 of the system , such as glass1 , must always be above @xmath9 ; thus , the thermodynamic entropy must decrease during relaxation ; the decrease is a consequence of the second law .",
    "the conclusion of the thermodynamic approach is summarized in theorem [ theorem_relaxation ] : the thermodynamic entropy must decrease with time during any isothermal relaxation in isobaric vitrification .",
    "uca developed by gmc as an attempt to describe glass transition in any material does not fulfill both requirements ca1 and ca2 . not only that , the glass transition and relaxation are described as inverse processes .",
    "faced with these discrepancies and several other unconventional and not adequetly explained aspects of uca , we have carefully examined it in this work . to test the validity of their inverse conjecture uca5 , we decided to treat @xmath0 as part of @xmath11 .",

    "they argue that the residual entropy must vanish in accordance with the third law ( uca2 ) .",
    "however , a careful reconsideration shows that there is nothing wrong in using the classical non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "indeed , its use clearly establishes that the calorimetric entropy @xmath160 at absolute zero is a _ lower bound to the residual entropy _ ; the former entropy is normally found to be non - negative , which makes @xmath283 thus , the primary motivation of gmc to develop their unconventional approach uca is based on an incorrect understanding of classical thermodynamics .     as discussed in sect .",

    "_ this is most certainly unphysical . _ in our opinion , it is this conjecture that results in the entropy loss during a glass transition under cooling .    even if we allow for the entropy to increase from zero due to some unknown reasons , not offered by gmc , we find that @xmath8 will always increase towards @xmath9 of the equilibrated supercooled liquid .",
