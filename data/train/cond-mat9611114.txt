    "quantum spin chains have been a field of intense theoretical activity for the past decade @xcite .",
    "this seems pertinent in the face of the tremendous advance made in the fabrication of quasi - one dimensional systems .",
    "there are a lot of compounds like @xmath5 which are essentially spin-@xmath0 chains , nenp - a spin-@xmath6 chain @xcite and a host of other organic compounds whose behaviours can be adequately described within the framework of interacting spin systems @xcite .",
    "the heisenberg model with purely nearest neighbour interactions has been instrumental in understanding various properties of these spin systems @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , there are compounds with alternation in the nearest neighbour bonds ( arises as a result of interactions with phonons ) eg tmttf , strong single ion anisotropies etc .",
    "the effects of spin - peierls dimerization , interchain interactions and competing nearest neighbour interactions have been reasonably well understood in the spin-@xmath7 case @xcite .",
    "these are known to drive phase transitions in the pure spin-@xmath0 model .",
    "the basic issue addressed is whether there exists a gap above the singlet ground state to the first excited state which is a triplet .",
    "apart from these , the ground state could also exhibit crossovers from short range neel order to spiral order or spontaneously dimerise @xcite but these are not signals of any kind of quantum phase transitions .",
    "more interesting phases can be obtained by placing these gapped systems in a magnetic field .",
    "for some critical value of the field @xmath2 , the system undergoes a continuous phase transition from a commensurate neel ( c ) zero uniform magnetisation phase to an incommensurate phase ( ic ) with non - zero magnetisation . as the magnetic field",
    "is increased , the magnetisation increases and saturates at some critical @xmath3 where the ground state is fully ferromagnetic but differs from the xxx ferromagnet in that it has a finite gap to the first excited state .",
    "the intermediate region ( between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) is completely gapless and the pitch vector @xmath8 ( the value of the momenta at which the static structure factor shows a peak ) decreases continuously from @xmath9 at @xmath2 to @xmath10 at @xmath3 .",
    "evidence for such transitions were seen in the spin-@xmath7 ladder compound @xmath11 @xcite and the quasi one - dimensional spin-@xmath7 systems @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the c - ic transition seen in @xmath13 @xcite can be understood in a similar manner if it is treated as a spin chain with spin - peierls interactions alone . however , because of the presence of strong phonon interactions in @xmath13 , various complications can arise , in particular , the transition becomes first - order .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the properties of a generic gapped spin-@xmath0 system in the presence of an external magnetic field . though the naive expectation is that all gapped systems might exhibit similar behaviours in the presence of the field , we find that they have very different properties depending on the nature of the interaction which creates the gap .",
    "in particular we focus on experimentally measurable quantities like the total magnetisation , nmr relaxation rates and neutron scattering intensities .",
    "to do this we calculate various spin - spin dynamic correlation functions in the gapless region between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we calculate various exponents in the ic regime close to @xmath2 and use these to calculate the temperature dependence of the nmr rates @xmath14 .",
    "we also discuss in detail the consequences of our results for the dimerised , frustrated and ladder systems .",
    "we find that though magnetisation measurements will not help differentiate between these systems , neutron scattering and nmr can .",
    "since the models studied in this paper directly describe the compounds mentioned above , the results obtained here are of immediate relevance to experiments .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : sec .",
    "ii contains a very brief review of spin-@xmath0 chains and the technique of bosonization used in this paper . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce our hamiltonian for a generic gapped spin-@xmath15 chain and discuss the effects of the applied magnetic field and the consequences of incommensurability induced by the magnetic field .",
    "we present in sec .",
    "iv our results for the dynamic correlations and the values of the exponents near the transition at @xmath2 for a generic gapped spin-@xmath16 chain .",
    "we also discuss the generic phase diagram as a function of magnetic field and temperature .",
    "the spin ladder is treated separately in sec .",
    "v. in sec .",
    "vi , we calculate the temperature dependence of the nmr rate @xmath17 and discuss the behaviour of the same for the cases of the dimerised , frustrated and ladder models .",
    "vii contains the concluding remarks .",
    "here we present a brief introduction to the physics of spin-@xmath7 chains and summarise certain results relevant to the work presented here .",
    "the main hamiltonian of interest is the heisenberg model : @xmath18 where the @xmath19 is a localised spin @xmath0 operator .",
    "we set @xmath20 in the rest of the calculation .",
    "this model is bethe ansatz soluble and is known to be gapless .",
    "a lot is known about the static and dynamic properties of this system .",
    "eventhough there are various methods used to study spin-@xmath0 chains , in this paper we use the machinery of bosonization since this enables us to deduce various properties in a relatively easy manner . since this is an oft used method we sketch the details briefly .",
    "we first use the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite which essentially maps the spin problem onto a problem of interacting fermions on a lattice . for the spin-@xmath0 system considered here ,",
    "the corresponding fermionic problem has fermi momentum @xmath21 .",
    "we then perform a linearisation around the free fermi points given by @xmath22 , to obtain an effective low energy continuum fermionic theory and then bosonize using the standard dictionary of abelian bosonization @xcite .",
    "we just present the final expressions obtained for the spin @xmath0 operators in terms of the bose field @xmath23 and its dual @xmath24 @xmath25   \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , eqs.(2 ) can be used to obtain the bosonized version of the hamiltonian given in eq.(1 ) i.e. , @xmath26   \\label { 3}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the spin wave velocity , @xmath28 is the momentum conjugate to the field @xmath23 and @xmath29 for the isotropic hamiltonian of eq.(1 ) .",
    "@xmath30 is just the hamiltonian for free bosons .",
    "note that @xmath31 for the case of the xx- antiferromagnet which in turn is equivalent to a theory of free fermions via the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "other values of @xmath32 correspond to having a @xmath33 coupling and hence to interacting fermions .",
    "since there is no mass term for the @xmath23 field , it is clear that there is no gap to the first excited state from the singlet ground state .",
    "since a free boson theory given by eq.(3 ) is trivially solvable , it is fairly straightforward to calculate the dynamic correlation functions using eqs.(2 ) .",
    "in many compounds which mimic the behaviour of spin-@xmath0 chains , it has often been found that there are many other interactions between spins , apart from the the isotropic interaction summarised in the hamiltonian of eq.(1 ) .",
    "these could be anisotropies , frustration , impurities and interchain couplings .",
    "more often than not , it is found that these interactions are small and can be treated as perturbations of the above gapless system . within the framework presented here , the effects of these perturbations can be gauged from whether they are relevant , marginal or irrelevant in the renormalisation group sense .",
    "depending on whether the perturbations are relevant or irrelevant , a gap opens in the spectrum . in this paper",
    "we are interested in a weak spin - peierls dimerisation and frustration arising from next nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "we first consider a small dimerization @xmath34 , which arises from spin - lattice interactions .",
    "the corresponding perturbation to the hamiltonian given in eq.(1 ) is @xmath35 using eqs.(2 ) the bosonized continuum version of ( 4 ) is@xcite @xmath36 it is equally interesting to study the effect of a competing next nearest neighbour interaction @xmath37 .",
    "such an interaction tends to frustrate the system .",
    "the addition to eq.(1 ) is @xmath38 for classical spins , the ground state retains its neel like order for all @xmath39 and exhibits spiral order for @xmath40 .",
    "this is just a crossover as it is not possible for @xmath37 to drive a zero temperature phase transition in the classical system .",
    "what is the behaviour of the quantum spin-@xmath0 system ? to study this we again take recourse to eqs . ( 2 ) and write down the bosonized version of eq.(6)@xcite @xmath41    apart from the cosine terms mentioned above , these spin interactions also renormalise the velocity @xmath27 in ( 3 ) .",
    "we now analyse the effects of the interactions given by eqs.(6,7 ) . in the free boson theory of eq.(3 ) , the anomalous dimensions of the operators @xmath42 are given by @xmath43 . using this at the isotropic point @xmath44",
    ", we see that @xmath45 given by eq.(5 ) has dimension @xmath7 and hence is relevant for all values of @xmath46 .",
    "similarly @xmath47 described in eq.(7 ) is found to have dimension @xmath48 and is marginal .",
    "numerically it has been shown that @xmath47 is marginally relevant for @xmath49 and irrelevant for @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can see that both @xmath46 and @xmath37 drive a quantum phase transition from a gapless phase to a phase where a gap opens in the dispersion for all values of @xmath46 and @xmath51 .    instead of restricting ourselves to the dimerised and frustrated models in this paper , we study the following hamiltonian generic to gapped spin-@xmath7 chains in a magnetic field : @xmath52 \\label { 8}\\ ] ] the 2-parameter space spanned by @xmath53 correspond to various spin-@xmath0 systems with gaps in their spectra . for example",
    ", @xmath54 corresponds to the dimerised model and @xmath55 is the frustrated antiferromagnet .",
    "we see that though all these models have a gap , we can differentiate between them by studying their excitation spectra the nature of which depends on the values of @xmath32 and @xmath56 .",
    "for instance , it is known from the study of excitations in the sine - gordon theories @xcite , that apart from the magnons and solitons there exist certain excitations called breathers .",
    "these are non - linear like the solitons and manifest themselves as discrete levels in excitation spectrum .",
    "these breathers have energies higher than the singlet - triplet gap but lie below the continuum part of the spectrum generated by the solitons .",
    "the number @xmath57 of such breather modes is given by @xmath58 .",
    "for example , we see that the frustrated model has no breather modes in its excitation spectrum . on the other hand",
    "the spin - peierls system has two breather modes in its spectrum : the @xmath59 breather is just a renormalized magnon and the @xmath60 breather is a bound state of two magnons .",
    "this extra bound state is found to affect the spin correlation function at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "optical experiments on the lines of ref . where breathers in quasi-1d ferromagnets were detected , can be used to directly detect these breathers .",
    ".5 true cm      we now study the effect of a magnetic field on these gapped systems .",
    "to do so , we turn on a magnetic field @xmath1 in the @xmath61-direction . note that the magnetic field breaks the @xmath62 symmetry .",
    "the interaction with the spins on the lattice is @xmath63    a simple understanding of the effect of the field can be obtained in the fermionic picture .",
    "first of all , the application of the magnetic field is equivalent to a chemical potential for the fermions . when @xmath64 we have zero uniform magnetisation i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "this corresponds to a completely filled lower band for fermions with a gap @xmath66  separating the lower and the upper bands and the fermi energy lying in the middle .",
    "as we increase @xmath1 , we are in effect shifting the fermi energy .",
    "a point is reached where the fermi energy crosses the gap and lies at the bottom of the upper band .",
    "this value of @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath2 i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath1 is increased beyond @xmath2 , the upper band is partially filled resulting in a non zero magnetisation @xmath68 .",
    "the zero magnetisation region with a gap below @xmath2 is the commensurate ( c ) regime in that , short range antiferromagnetic order still persists . above @xmath2 , the ground state is magnetised , has no gap and canted .",
    "this is what we call the incommensurate ( ic ) phase .",
    "this is a quantum phase transition and @xmath69 is the relevant order parameter .",
    "this is what makes it different from the incommensurate(spiral ) phases seen in frustrated systems ( sec .",
    "iiia ) @xcite .",
    "now that we have a heuristic understanding of the effect of the magnetic field we now proceed to calculate various quantities of interest like the magnetisation and exponents in the vicinity of @xmath2 , within the continuum approximation . using eqs.(2 )",
    "we can see that eq.(9 ) corresponds to adding a gradient term  @xmath70   to the hamiltonian of eq.(8 ) .",
    "@xmath71 this hamiltonian has the same form as the one used in the context of the c - ic transition in two - dimensional systems where it is a transition from a phase with a a discrete symmetry ( c ) to a phase with a continuous symmetry(ic ) @xcite .",
    "note that the gradient term in eq.(10 ) can be eliminated by a simple shift of the @xmath23 field i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "since the only effect of @xmath1 below @xmath2 is to renormalise the gap , we can replace this shift by @xmath73 where @xmath68 is the magnetisation .",
    "the cosine term , however , is not invariant under this shift . from the analogy with the chemical potential in fermionic systems , we infer that the magnetic field changes the fermi momentum .",
    "we can redefine new fermi points @xmath74 , linearise around these points and obtain a new effective massless free boson theory , albeit with a different value of @xmath32 .",
    "it has gapless modes at @xmath75 and @xmath76 . a schematic plot of the field dependent dispersion for the spins in the ic phase is given in fig.1 .",
    "the behaviour in the gapless ic region is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath77 \\label{11 } \\ ] ] the quantities @xmath78 and @xmath79 are dependent on @xmath1 .",
    "although it is difficult to obtain the dependences for the entire range of @xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one can compute the exact values for the exponents ( equivalently the @xmath79 ) at the critical point @xmath2 and see how they change as we move away from these points .",
    "before we proceed with the calculation of @xmath79 , we first study how the magnetisation rises above @xmath2 . using the results on the c - ic transition @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath56 is",
    "the coefficient of @xmath23 in the argument of the cosine interaction and @xmath81 is a constant of proportionality which depends on the renormalised velocities .",
    "the magnetisation increases from its zero value as a square root near @xmath2 .",
    "a similar square root behaviour is seen near @xmath3 if one approaches this critical point from the ferromagnetic side .",
    "here it is the decrease in magnetisation from the full ferromagnetic value that shows the square root behaviour . in fig.2 , we have shown the behaviour of the magnetisation with temperature and the field in units of @xmath82 .",
    "this was done using the analogy with the case of fermions with a gap and a chemical potential .",
    "we assumed a dispersion for the fermions of the form @xmath83 . here",
    "the two square root regimes near @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the figure ) are joined by a region in which the magnetisation increases in a nearly linear fashion with @xmath1 .",
    "the interval of @xmath1 in which the square root behaviour of the magnetisation is seen and also the range where the nearly linear regime is seen , depend on the parameters like the couplings and the gap . for certain ranges of these parameters where the gap @xmath66 is of the order of the exchange couplings one obtains a scenario where the width of the square root regime is quite small so that even experiments done at reasonably low temperatures could entirely miss the detection of this region .",
    "this might be the reason as to why the square root behaviour is not observed in ref . .",
    "since the behaviour of the magnetisation given by eq.(12 ) is generic to all the gapped systems studied here , it follows that a measurement of the magnetisation will not be able to qualitatively differentiate between the various models .",
    "the magnetisation derived in eq .",
    "( 12 ) applies to the ladder also .",
    "this is because , as we will later show in sec .",
    "v , the effective hamiltonian for the ladder has the same form as given in eq.(10 ) .",
    "another system which exhibits a similar transition in the magnetic field is the spin-@xmath6 chain .",
    "since the spin-@xmath0 ladder and the spin-@xmath6 chain belong to the same universality class@xcite , eq.(12 ) describes the magnetisation in the spin-@xmath6 chain also .",
    "this agrees well with the result for @xmath68 in spin-@xmath6 chains obtained in ref .. in ref .",
    "a mapping of a phenomenological hamiltonian of interacting magnons onto a system of bosons with repulsive @xmath46-fn interactions was used to obtain the magnetisation and the correlations in the ic regime .",
    "naively one might expect that these gapped systems in a magnetic field have the same qualitative behaviour for correlation functions and that quantitative features like @xmath86 and thermodynamic quantities like @xmath68 are model dependent .",
    "we shall see below that this is not true and that these models have dynamically different physical behaviours in the ic regime depending on the value of @xmath56 . for a generic interaction of the form @xmath42 ( where @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 on the ic side , @xcite @xmath89 here",
    "@xmath66 is the gap and @xmath90 is a positive constant which depends on the parameters of the theory but is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath24 is defined by @xmath91 . at the transition @xmath2",
    ", @xmath79 goes to a universal value @xmath92 independent of the value of @xmath32 . as @xmath1 increases",
    ", there is a non - zero magnetisation @xmath68 and the change in @xmath79 is completely governed by @xmath56 and @xmath32 in that @xmath79 could increase or decrease depending on the value of @xmath32 .",
    "for example , for the frustrated ( @xmath37 ) model @xmath93 at @xmath94 and increases as @xmath1 increases and for the case of the dimerised @xmath95 model , @xmath96 at @xmath94 and decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "here we have seen that though the magnetisation has the same qualitative behaviour for all the models , the value of @xmath79 is model dependent because it is determined by the anomalous dimensions of the perturbing operators . as a consequence",
    "the exponents in these models will be radically different as will be shown in the following section .",
    "in this section , we first study how the structures of the correlation functions are altered by the magnetisation in the ic phase .",
    "later we will calculate the various commensurate and incommensurate contributions to the finite temperature dynamic susceptibility . from the magnetic interaction given by eq.(9 ) and the field shift @xmath97 , it is clear that since for @xmath98 there is no net magnetisation , the form of the correlators is unaffected and only the gap is renormalised .",
    "however , in the ic phase , the presence of a non - zero magnetisation @xmath68 results in @xmath99 .",
    "the dual field @xmath24 is insensitive to this shift . incorporating this field shift in the expressions for the spin operators given in eq.(2 ) ,",
    "we find that the generic form of the spin - spin correlation function in the ic region is @xmath100 where @xmath101 are monotonic , decreasing , power - law functions of space and time and they go to zero asymptotically . from the above expressions we deduce the following : the correlation function parallel to the field i.e. , @xmath102 , has a uniform magnetisation or equivalently a @xmath103 mode while the staggered part is shifted from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "this is in contrast to the correlation in the plane perpendicular to the field , @xmath106 , where the staggered mode is unshifted and remains at @xmath104 and the uniform magnetisation ( @xmath103 ) mode is shifted to @xmath107 .",
    "we call @xmath108 and @xmath109 the incommensurate modes .    with the results obtained above",
    ", we now proceed with our calculation of experimentally relevant quantities like the dynamic susceptibilities at finite temperatures . as a first step we compute the associated unequal time correlation functions using eqs.(2),(14 ) and the result of eq.(13 ) .",
    "the correlation functions are found to be as follows : @xmath110       \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath79 being specified by eq.(13 ) .",
    "it is not surprising that the exponents are different in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the external field .",
    "this is because the magnetic field breaks the @xmath62 spin rotational invariance . for the case of the dimerised model at the critical magnetic field @xmath111 , we found in sec .",
    "iii that @xmath112 .",
    "an interesting coincidence is that the exponents and hence the correlation functions calculated here for the dimerised model at @xmath94 are the same as that for the xx- antiferromagnet in a zero magnetic field .",
    "the correlation functions of the xx - model ( which is in turn equivalent to a theory of free fermions ) can be obtained by substituting @xmath113 and @xmath112 in eqs.(15 ) .",
    "note that this correspondence holds only at the critical point .    using the above results we can also evaluate the @xmath114 dependent susceptibility at finite temperatures , both in the direction of the applied magnetic field and in the direction perpendicular to it .",
    "a knowledge of this quantity helps us extract various measurable quantities like neutron scattering intensities , absorption and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) rates .",
    "the susceptibilities are given by the following expression @xmath115\\rangle_t   \\label { 16}\\ ] ] here @xmath116 refer to the components of the spin and the subscript @xmath117 implies that the correlator is evaluated at finite temperature . since rotations in the @xmath118 plane still leave the hamiltonian invariant , there are no cross correlations i.e. , @xmath119 . for the susceptibility @xmath120 in the @xmath121direction parallel to the direction of the applied field @xcite @xmath122 for the perpendicular susceptibility @xmath123 i.e. , in the @xmath118 plane @xmath124    \\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 , @xmath128 is the beta function and @xmath129 is the effective magnetisation dependent spin velocity . @xmath57 and @xmath130 are velocity and hence field dependent pre - factors .",
    "these expressions for the susceptibilites are valid as long @xmath131 .",
    "this is because above this temperature the hamiltonian in eq.(11 ) obtained by linearising the fermi surface around @xmath132 is no longer valid .    though we have explicitly calculated the susceptibilites only in the ic regime for low temperatures , it is nonetheless interesting to study the behaviour outside this ic phase .",
    "for example , one can study how the system crosses over to the high temperature classical limit as a function of the parameters of the theory .",
    "we present a phase diagram as a function of @xmath117 and @xmath1 in fig.3 .",
    "this phase diagram is true only for @xmath133 because at @xmath3 the system makes a transition to another gapped phase . for temperatures smaller than the exchange",
    "@xmath134 one obtains four regimes as indicated in fig .",
    "3 . all the lines indicate crossovers and are not phase transitions .",
    "this phase diagram can be easily understood within the fermionic picture .",
    "note that for the fermionised version of spin chains with a gap the complete dispersion for the excitations has the form @xmath135 .",
    "these two branches constitute the lower and upper bands with a gap @xmath136 separating the two bands . with the full dispersion ,",
    "the magnetisation is given by a function which depends on two parameters @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the different regimes to be discussed below will be characterised by the varied behaviour of this function .",
    "for all @xmath139 one gets the gapped phase where the chemical potential i.e , @xmath1 lies in the gap and the temperature is still small enough and does not excite particles to the upper band .",
    "this phase is characterised by an exponential decay of all correlation functions . when @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the chemical potential lies in the upper band and we get the the incommensurate or luttinger liquid i regime as was already discussed in sec .",
    "iiib ( cf .",
    "the dynamical exponent is z=1 here .",
    "the susceptibilites in eqs.(17 - 19 ) are valid in this luttinger liquid regime .",
    "if the chemical potential lies at the bottom of the upper band and @xmath142 or equivalently when temperature is such that it can excite particles at the fermi level to the bottom of the upper band , one obtains the quantum critical regime@xcite defined by @xmath143 . in the quantum critical region the physics is governed by the fixed point@xcite at @xmath94 where @xmath79 has a universal value @xmath92 .",
    "a simple way of understanding the behaviour in this region is presented below .",
    "firstly , the curvature of the bottom of the band becomes very important in that the effective dispersion seen by the excitations is quadratic .",
    "here one can expand @xmath144 in @xmath66 to obtain @xmath145 in the quantum critical region .",
    "the dynamical exponent @xmath146 in this region .",
    "a direct consequence of the quadratic dispersion is that @xmath137 and @xmath138 are no longer independent scaling variables and only occur in the combination @xmath147 and the magnetisation @xmath68 which is just the number of fermions in the upper band has the scaling form @xmath148 .",
    "analogous scaling functions exist for the spin - spin correlations also .",
    "the scaling functions for the correlators are functions of @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "note that @xmath137 and @xmath138 are no longer independent scaling variables and only occur in the combination @xmath147 .",
    "the spins are complicated functions of the fermions and this results in the scaling functions being difficult to obtain for reasons described in ref .. the quantum critical behaviour holds only as long as the quadratic form of the dispersion assumed is valid or in other words , only as long as temperature is such that the bulk of the excitations is confined to the bottom of the upper band .",
    "similar phases were obtained in ref . in the context of spin-@xmath6 chains in a magnetic field , using a phenomenological theory of magnons with repulsive interactions . here starting from a microscopic description , we find that these phases are generic to all gapped chains in a field and we have also obtained the exponents in the luttinger liquid regime i.    now if temperature is increased further , there is a crossover to a fourth region . this regime was not obtained in ref . because the form @xmath152 was assumed for all values of @xmath153 . above a certain temperature excitations to higher @xmath153 states occur and one starts probing the deviation from a quadratic dispersion and the @xmath154 approximation is no longer valid . as a result the quantum critical scaling for the magnetisation etc .",
    ", will no longer be valid above these temperatures .",
    "the system then crosses over to a new region where temperature is large enough such that in addition to the excitations which now involve states way above the bottom of the upper band , there are transitions between the lower and the upper bands .",
    "this implies that the gap becomes irrelevant and the effective dispersion becomes linear in @xmath153 .",
    "this crossover should occur for temperatures @xmath117 of the order of twice the gap @xmath66 but much lesser than the exchange couplings such that the interaction becomes irrelevant and the resulting behaviour is that of a luttinger liquid .",
    "we denote this regime as the luttinger liquid ii .",
    "classical behaviour sets in for temperatures greater than the exchange couplings .",
    "the widths of all these regions are dictated by the values of the gaps and the exchange coupling .",
    "for instance , the width of the quantum critical regime is fixed by the gap alone , and for magnetic fields away from @xmath2 this width is quite small and not as large as purported to be in ref . .",
    "as a consequence , the scaling arguments apply only in the vicinity of the fixed point at @xmath2 where the width of the quantum critical regime is appreciable and not for fields far away from it .",
    "in contrast , the width of the luttinger liquid ii regime is given by the relative sizes of @xmath134 and @xmath66 .",
    "this width can be increased or decreased by tuning the ratio @xmath155 . applying these arguments to the case of spin-@xmath6 chains where the gap of of the order of the exchange coupling @xmath134",
    ", one finds that for small fields the classical limit sets in soon and there are no sharp crossovers between the quantum critical , luttinger liquid ii and classical regimes .    in the following paragraphs",
    "we discuss the physical significance of the susceptibilites calculated above .",
    "the susceptibilities are directly relevant to inelastic neutron scattering measurements where apart from certain magnetic form factors , the intensity is proportional to the @xmath156 fourier transform of the full spin - spin correlator @xmath157 . from eqs.(17 ) , we can see that the scattering intensity in the ic phase due to the @xmath69 correlator , obtained as a function of @xmath158 for some fixed @xmath159 , should in addition to the peak generated by the massless excitations near @xmath103 contains an extra peak corresponding to the massless modes at the incommensurate @xmath160 .",
    "similarly , for the correlations perpendicular to the field , peaks are seen at the staggered mode @xmath104 and at @xmath108 .",
    "these peaks are divergent at @xmath161 because of the power law correlations present at these values of @xmath8 . at finite temperatures the peak heights are finite and",
    "are determined by the @xmath117 dependence of eqs.(17 - 19 ) .",
    "such incommensurate features have been observed in inelastic neutron scattering data from copper benzoate which is a @xmath162 system in a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "another probe is electron spin resonance ( esr ) which can be used to directly probe the nature of the continuum of excitations at @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "one interesting question is whether the propagating modes corresponding to the uniform and staggered magnetisation are damped at finite temperature or in other words , is there any thermal broadening ?",
    "this can be answered by studying the temperature dependence of the imaginary parts of the corresponding susceptibilites .",
    "first consider the case of the isotropic spin-@xmath7 chain in zero magnetic field .",
    "here it is known that the uniform magnetisation component of the @xmath69 correlator diverges as @xmath163 .",
    "the corresponding uniform and staggered susceptibilities at finite temperatures are given by @xcite , eqs.(17 ) with @xmath113 and @xmath164 .",
    "isotropy results in the same expressions for the perpendicular susceptibility . in this context",
    "@xmath129 is the spinon velocity .",
    "the dependence of @xmath165 on temperature tells us that the @xmath104 mode is damped at finite @xmath117 .",
    "the temperature independence of the @xmath166 implies that there is no damping of the @xmath103 mode at finite @xmath117@xcite .",
    "this can also be understood from the fact that the exponent @xmath167 in eq.(18 ) is zero at @xmath168 .",
    "there is no damping of this mode within the continuum approximation where the fermionic dispersion was assumed to be linear .",
    "taking into account a small curvature of the fermion dispersion spectrum does not alter this result because the height of the peak which is given by the lifetime of the quasiparticles in the fermionic picture becomes infinite as @xmath169 even at finite temperatures .",
    "another way of understanding this absence of damping of the uniform mode is by noting the fact that the total magnetisation in all the directions commutes with the hamiltonian which in turn implies that there is no damping of this mode in the lattice spin system .",
    "we now discuss the damping of the various modes in the ic phase .",
    "the modes are the uniform magnetisation mode @xmath103 , the staggered mode @xmath104 and the incommensurate modes at @xmath108 and @xmath160 . from eqs.(17 - 19 )",
    "we see that the dominant contribution to the @xmath104 and @xmath107 modes is from the perpendicular susceptibility . as in the heisenberg case",
    "discussed above , the staggered mode at @xmath104 has a damping factor proportional to @xmath170 .",
    "similarly the presence of a non - integral exponent @xmath167 in @xmath171 results in the @xmath108 mode being damped at finite temperatures by a factor proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "similarly the behaviour of the @xmath109 mode is dictated by @xmath173 in eq.(17 ) and has a damping factor @xmath174 .",
    "we now consider the @xmath103 mode .",
    "the dominant contribution to the damping of this mode arises from @xmath166 . from eqs.(17 ) , we find that the parallel susceptibility does not damp the @xmath103 modes because @xmath166 is still independent of temperature . because the system is not isotropic we need to check whether there is a sub - dominant contribution from the perpendicular susceptibility which damps this mode . to do this we first study the damping for other values of @xmath8 between @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "note that this damping can be studied at the resonance frequencies  @xmath177   or away from resonance . to obtain the leading temperature dependence of the damping of these modes at resonance",
    ", we substitute  @xmath178   in eq.(18 ) .",
    "the resonance frequency @xmath158 is fixed at @xmath179 .",
    "the low temperature behaviour of the imaginary part of the susceptibility is given by @xmath180 this expression implies that there is a thermal broadening of the @xmath103 or uniform magnetisation mode i.e. ,  @xmath181 . nevertheless , using the fact that the total magnetisation in the @xmath121 direction still commutes with the hamiltonian even in the presence of the magnetic field and that the time evolution of @xmath182 involves only @xmath183 we conclude that there is no thermal broadening of the uniform mode @xmath184 mode .",
    "if @xmath158 is not at the resonance frequency then for low @xmath117 , there is no obvious thermal broadening and @xmath185 is proportional to  @xmath186^{\\beta -1}~$ ] .",
    "this expression is not valid for @xmath187 and fails in the vicinity of @xmath188 . from these calculations",
    "we see that though bosonisation describes the physics correctly near @xmath104 and @xmath107 for the perpendicular correlations it does not describe modes far away from these two points well .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the fact that by linearising at @xmath132 we take into account a lot of spurious states at the bottom of the band . to summarise , we find that the @xmath103 mode is undamped whereas the gapless modes at @xmath189 and @xmath190 are all damped .",
    "another system which exhibits a behaviour akin to the systems studied above is the spin ladder . here",
    "we consider a ladder with two identical and isotropic chains .",
    "let the spins in chain @xmath6 be labelled @xmath191 and that in chain @xmath48 , @xmath192 .",
    "we bosonize this system in the same manner as above .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "we adopt the notations of these references and introduce the symmetric(triplet ) and antisymmetric ( singlet ) combinations of the fields : @xmath193 and their respective duals @xmath194 and @xmath195 . the hamiltonian for the ladder is @xmath196 where @xmath197   \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal h}_s & = & { 1 \\over   { 2\\pi } } \\int dx [ ku ( \\pi \\pi_s)^2 + ( { u\\over k } ) ( \\partial_{x } \\phi_s)^2 + g_3 \\cos ( { \\sqrt 8 } \\phi_s ) ] \\label{22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 is the interchain coupling and @xmath201 some constant .",
    "all the cosine operators are relevant operators of dimension one .",
    "eqs.(22 ) have the same form as the hamiltonian for an isotropic spin-@xmath6 system written in terms of two spin-@xmath0 operators@xcite .",
    "we note that the spin-@xmath6 system has fixed values for @xmath202 and @xmath203 and has no analog of a tunable parameter like @xmath204 .",
    "nevertheless the results to be derived below apply to the spin-@xmath6 system in a magnetic field . from eqs.(21 ) and ( 22 ) we can infer the existence of gaps for all non - zero values of @xmath205 in the spectra of both the fields @xmath206 and @xmath207 . the ground state of the ladder is a spin singlet and there exists a gap to the triplet excited state characterised by @xmath208 .",
    "therefore , analogous to the dimerised chains , we expect the vanishing of the gap and the onset of a gapless incommensurate phase for some critical value of the magnetic field .",
    "since the magnetic field acts on both chains equally , we can easily see from the bosonization formulas that @xmath1 affects only the @xmath208 field @xmath209 note that this hamiltonian has the same form as eq.(10 ) .",
    "therefore , using the results obtained in sec.iii , we can immediately see that the @xmath208 field becomes massless while in the antisymmetric sector the @xmath195 field acquires a non - zero expectation value and the @xmath210 still has a gap . as a result the correlations of the @xmath210 field decay exponentially .",
    "the value of @xmath79 for the @xmath208 field at @xmath94 is @xmath164 . from eq.(13),we",
    "find that @xmath211 above @xmath2 also .",
    "this is because @xmath212 for the ladder .",
    "however , one should note that this is valid only in the region close to @xmath2 and provided that the gaps and the magnetic field are small compared to the intrachain exchange coupling . using the above results we can compute the spin correlation functions .",
    "there are two kinds of correlations : correlations within a chain and between chains . here",
    "again the magnetic field changes the structure of the correlation functions in a manner analogous to that described in eqs.(14 ) .",
    "we summarise the results for the various correlators below . since we are concerned only with the asymptotic behaviours we present only the power law contributions to these correlators .",
    "@xmath213 \\label{24}\\ ] ] here @xmath214 denote the chain labels . unlike in the single chain case , in the ladder _ the alternating part at @xmath104 which is now shifted to @xmath215 by the magnetic field decays exponentially_. similarly @xmath216 here again _ the uniform component is shifted to @xmath217 and decays exponentially_. the fact that @xmath210 is massive results in an exponential decay of all the incommensurate contributions to the correlations .",
    "this exponential decay of all the incommensurate correlations in the ladder is in contrast to the single chain systems studied in the previous sections .",
    "also note that except for certain exponentially decaying corrections , the interchain and intrachain correlators have essentially the same asymptotic behaviours . as already mentioned , the spin ladder in the magnetic field has the same exponents as that of the spin-@xmath6 chain in a magnetic field @xcite . the dominant contribution to the perpendicular susceptibility for the ladder",
    "has the same form as that given in eq.(19 ) with @xmath218 and that to the parallel susceptibility by @xmath166 of eq.(17 ) . at the critical point @xmath94 , the exponent @xmath219 for the ladder as well as the dimerised model .",
    "however , there is one big difference between the two models . in the dimerised model",
    ", the incommensurate parts of the @xmath102 and @xmath220 also show power law behaviours whereas , in the ladder they decay exponentially .",
    "this has a serious consequence for neutron scattering intensities .",
    "this is because for the dimerised system , at @xmath161 the power law divergences of the incommensurate parts of the dynamic correlations will result in a divergent peak at the incommensurate wave vector @xmath8 . on the other hand the exponential decay of the incommensurate correlations results in much smaller peaks at incommensurate @xmath8",
    "whose finite height and width are determined by the gaps in the @xmath210 field .",
    "though away from the critical point the exponents for the two models are no longer identical , the discussion presented above for the neutron scattering still holds .",
    "with the help of the susceptibilites derived above , we can easily compute various quantities that can be studied by neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) . here , we focus on nmr and in particular the the spin lattice relaxation time @xmath221 .",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath221 comes from the coupling of the nuclei to the lattice spins .",
    "therefore , it is a good probe to study the nature of the lattice spin system . to obtain the temperature dependence of @xmath221 we use the following formula in terms of the local susceptibility to calculate the same @xcite .",
    "@xmath222 here the @xmath223 are hyperfine form factors and @xmath224 has been defined in eq.(16 ) . in general",
    "these form factors are diagonal in @xmath116 and do not vary much with @xmath159 . for a system of non - interacting spins , @xmath225 is a constant . for interacting spin systems , the dependence on temperature could be more complicated because the underlying magnetic order plays a very important role in that it changes the effective magnetic field seen by the nuclei .",
    "examples are the isotropic heisenberg model where , @xmath226 goes to a non - zero value as @xmath227 and the spin - peierls system where @xmath4 goes to zero at @xmath161 because of the gap to spin excitations .",
    "we now use the results obtained in the previous section to calculate the nmr rates .",
    "we first note that the magnetisation @xmath68 only shifts the resonance frequency and does not change the form of the expressions for @xmath4 . depending on the kind of nmr done , one can probe specific correlations .",
    "this is especially useful for anisotropic spin systems and also isotropic systems in a magnetic field where the perpendicular and parallel susceptibilites are different .",
    "for instance , if the nmr was done on the nucleus of the lattice spin , then the relaxation occurs through a contact interaction and @xmath4 depends on @xmath228 alone . on the other hand",
    "if it is done on other neighbouring nuclei in the compound , the relaxation is through dipolar interactions and @xmath4 depends on @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "an amalgam of the two methods will be useful in isolating the two susceptibilites experimentally .    substituting the expressions for @xmath230 derived in eqs .",
    "( 17),(18 ) and ( 19 ) in eq.(26 ) , we find that a straightforward power counting yields the following leading low temperature behaviour for the single chain models : @xmath231^{single chain }   =   a_{\\perp } t^ { { 1 \\over { 2\\tilde k } } -1 } + a_{\\parallel } t^ { 2 \\tilde k -1 }   + b_{\\parallel } t\\\\                 \\label{27}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is given by eq.(13 ) . @xmath232,@xmath233 and @xmath234 are constants independent of temperature . the suffixes @xmath235 and",
    "@xmath236 refer to the contributions from the perpendicular and parallel susceptibilites .",
    "it is easy to see that the staggered susceptibilities dominate in @xmath4 .",
    "for the ladder model , @xmath4 is given by @xmath231^{ladder }   =   a_{\\perp } t^ { { 1 \\over { 4\\tilde k } } -1 }    + b_{\\parallel } t\\\\                 \\label{28}\\ ] ] the contribution coming from the @xmath233 term has not been explicitly written because it goes to zero exponentially as @xmath227 .",
    "the temperature dependences of these rates for the dimerised and frustrated models at the critical point @xmath2 are given below :    dimerised @xmath95 : @xmath237 frustrated models @xmath238 : @xmath239    in table i , we present the leading low @xmath117 contributions to @xmath4 at the transition , for the three models considered in this paper .",
    "there are other temperature dependent contributions to the nmr rate , but these go to zero at @xmath161 . as mentioned earlier there are two possible scenarios .",
    "one is that the nucleus probed does not correspond to the spins and the interactions are dipolar .",
    "here at @xmath94 , the @xmath4 diverges as @xmath240 for the three models .",
    "however , the divergent behaviour at low temperature in the frustrated model arises from the parallel susceptibility whereas in the ladder and dimerised systems it is the perpendicular susceptibility which leads to the divergent behaviour .",
    "this feature can be used to differentiate between the models as will be discussed in the following paragraph .",
    "as @xmath1 is increased , we can see from eq.(13 ) that @xmath79 increases for the frustrated model and the divergence becomes weaker .",
    "coincidentally @xmath79 decreases for the dimerised system and the divergence of @xmath4 becomes weaker too . for the ladder , @xmath79 does not change with @xmath1 and the divergence persists and one has to go to higher fields to see a deviation from the @xmath241 behaviour . if for some value of @xmath1 , @xmath242 decreases to @xmath243 in the dimerised model and increases to @xmath0 in the frustrated system , we see that @xmath4 does not diverge and @xmath17 goes to a constant @xmath244 as @xmath227 .",
    "this behaviour occurs because at some point the magnetic field becomes large enough such that the interaction which generates the gap becomes unimportant and should recover the exponents for the chain without the interaction i.e. , the heisenberg chain where @xmath4 is a constant . for fields greater than this value of @xmath1 ,",
    "the exponents vary like those of a heisenberg chain in a magnetic field .",
    "the exponent approaches that of the @xmath245 chain or free fermions for sufficiently large fields .",
    "another way of differentiating between the three models is if the nmr involves the nuclei of the relevant spins . here , only the perpendicular local susceptibilites matter and a very interesting picture unfolds . at @xmath94 ,",
    "@xmath4 diverges as @xmath240 for the dimerised and ladder models whereas it approaches zero linearly in @xmath117 for the frustrated model .",
    "naively , for gapless systems , we would have expected @xmath4 to diverge or go to a non - zero constant as @xmath246 as it does in the case of the heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "this @xmath117 dependence in the frustrated model is indeed strange because it is reminiscent of the @xmath4 rates for spin chains with gaps where @xmath4 also goes to zero as @xmath246 but exponentially !",
    "a divergence will be seen in the frustrated system if @xmath1 is such that @xmath247 . for increasing @xmath1",
    "the @xmath240 divergence survives in the ladder but for dimerised systems @xmath4 becomes less and less divergent as @xmath227 and later saturates to a constant @xmath232 at @xmath161 for some value of @xmath1 .",
    "this is very similar to what was seen in the case of dipolar interactions discussed above .",
    "however , note that the saturation values are different in both cases .",
    "we also note that the above discussion rests on the fact that these fields are smaller than @xmath3 which need not necessarily be the case . as mentioned above , for magnetic fields close to @xmath3 where the ground state is nearly ferromagnetic , we expect the system to approach the free fermion limit i.e. , @xmath248 . as a result @xmath4",
    "is expected to diverge as @xmath240 at @xmath249 for all the models irrespective of their values of @xmath56 .",
    "eventhough both the ladder and the dimerised systems have the same divergence at the critical point , one can differentiate between these two systems by studying the non - divergent contributions to @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for the frustrated model , there exists a correction to @xmath4 proportional to @xmath250 .",
    "this exponent changes with increasing magnetic field and corrections of a similar nature do not exist in the ladder .",
    "these corrections should manifest themselves at not too low temperatures .",
    "however , inelastic neutron scattering should be able to differentiate between them as previously discussed in sec .",
    "v. at temperatures large compared to the exchange couplings and the gap , from the analogy with fermions we expect that @xmath251 for all the models studied in this paper .",
    "a similar behaviour should be seen in the gapped phase i.e. , @xmath98 also .",
    "to summarise , we find that the kind of nmr experiments done can result in drastically different @xmath4 for the three models",
    ".    the results derived here can be checked in @xmath13 and various other quasi @xmath6d systems . however , with most compounds being @xmath252d the results obtained in this paper are applicable only in the temperature interval where the compound is effectively @xmath6d and that there is no @xmath252d magnetic ordering .",
    "such a magnetic ordering in @xmath252d could also result in divergent nmr rates .",
    "for instance , the onset of @xmath252d neel order at a certain temperature @xmath253 , results in @xmath4 diverging as @xmath254 for @xmath255@xcite .",
    "this behaviour is valid for a temperature range of size @xmath253 .",
    "since this divergence is the same as seen in the ladder , dimerised and frustrated systems at @xmath94 it is important to establish whether such a divergence arises from the quasi - one dimensional or the @xmath252d nature of the compound .",
    "this can be checked by working in the appropriate temperature interval where there is no @xmath252d ordering or by increasing the magnetic field .",
    "if the compound is in the @xmath6d regime , its exponents vary with the field as predicted above and it if has @xmath252d order the exponents do not vary with the field .",
    "we have studied the behaviours of various spin-@xmath7 models in the gapless ic phase induced by an external magnetic field . for a generic gapped",
    "spin-@xmath0 in a magnetic field , it was shown that the magnetisation is zero below @xmath2 and rises as a square root above it .",
    "we found that the gapless behaviour in the ic regime is determined by the dimension of the cosine operator and hence different systems have drastically different properties .",
    "the results presented here were obtained from a microscopic theory and not from a phenomenological theory as was done in the case of the spin-@xmath6 chain @xcite .",
    "we then discussed the implications of the finite magnetisation for the correlation functions .",
    "we found that the effect of the finite magnetisation was to shift the @xmath104 mode in the @xmath256 correlators to @xmath108 and the @xmath103 mode in the @xmath257 correlators to @xmath258 .",
    "we also calculated the unequal time correlation functions and have provided explicit formulas for the various susceptibilites as a function of @xmath259 .",
    "these were used to study the thermal broadening of the various modes in a single chain .",
    "we find that the modes at @xmath104 , @xmath217 and @xmath160 are broadened at finite temperatures whereas the @xmath103 mode is not .",
    "using the susceptibilites we also showed that neutron scattering intensities had extra peaks arising from the incommensurability in single chains but not in the ladder systems .",
    "we have also calculated the nmr relaxation rates as functions of temperature and have discussed the results for the dimerised , frustrated and ladder systems in detail . using the fermion analogy , we find that the phase diagram for a generic gapped chain as a function of field and and temperature has five regions as shown in fig.3 .",
    "in contrast to ref . where the system stays in the quantum critical regime for a wide range temperatures before it crosses over to the classical high temperature limit , we find that the system crosses over from the quantum critical regime to a second luttinger liquid regime before it becomes classical .",
    "this intermediate temperature behaviours follow from the form of the dispersion spectrum of fermions with a gap due to interactions .",
    "lastly , eventhough we have given the exact values of the exponents at the critical point @xmath2 alone , a knowledge of the magnetisation @xmath68 from experiments can be used in conjunction with eq.(13 ) to obtain the exponents and hence @xmath4 close to the transition at @xmath2 .",
