    "in living cells , there are many chemical reactions , and they forms complex networks such as metabolic networks and signal transduction networks .",
    "the dynamics of concentration of chemicals resulting from these networks is considered to be the origin of physiological functions .",
    "today , a huge information about reaction networks is available in databases such as kegg @xcite , reactome @xcite and biocyc @xcite .",
    "dynamics and steady state of reaction networks are determined by various factors in systems ; reaction - specific enzymes , input signals from outside of systems , and initial conditions in some cases .",
    "one of the standard approaches to elucidate the dynamics is a sensitivity experiment ; for example , in the research of metabolism , changes in concentrations of metabolites induced by perturbation in amounts / activities of enzymes are examined @xcite ( see fig [ fig : ko ] ) .        in previous theoretical studies @xcite , under an implicit assumption that the system has no conserved concentrations , one of the authors and his collaborator showed that the sensitivity of steady state to reaction rate parameters , which correspond to enzyme activities / amounts , is determined only from the structure of the chemical reaction network ( _ structural sensitivity analysis _ ) .",
    "such a structural approach has a great advantage because it is almost impossible to measure the precise kinetics and parameters of chemical reactions in living cells .",
    "we then proved a novel theorem , called the _ law of localization _",
    "the law of localization characterizes subnetworks by non - positive indices ( see @xmath0 in ) and identifies those which confine the effect of perturbations inside them .",
    "we call such subnetworks _ buffering structures_.    one of the main purposes of this paper is to extend our previous method to reaction systems where some of concentrations are conserved during the dynamics .",
    "for example , in the mapk pathway , while the ratio between activated and inactivated kinase concentrations changes after stimuli , the total number of them is conserved in time . in the presence of such conserved quantities , steady state concentrations and fluxes",
    "are influenced not only by reaction rate parameters but also by the initial values of conserved quantities .",
    "we take into account constraints coming from conserved quantities in the sensitivity analysis .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to explore biological meanings of buffering structures .",
    "buffering structures provide the system with robustness to enzymatic fluctuations since they confine the effects inside them .",
    "thus , we expect that possessing buffering structures are advantageous for living systems and networks with more buffering structures are selected during evolutionary process . in order to refine these expectations ,",
    "we quantify robustness of reaction networks and compare robustness of escherichia coli metabolism with artificial random networks .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "iii , we illustrate the method in a simple reaction network . in sec .",
    "iv , we extend the law of localization to any reaction networks . in sec .",
    "v , as applications , we study two signal transduction networks .",
    "the first network has conserved quantities and also include regulations from non - substrate chemicals .",
    "the second network also has conserved quantities . in sec .",
    "vi , we propose network characteristics for robustness , and compare the e. coli network and random networks .",

    "the structural sensitivity analysis is a systematic method of determining sensitivity of steady states to rate parameter perturbations from reaction network information alone @xcite .",

    "<S> in living cells , biochemical reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes and connect to one another by sharing substrates and products , forming complex networks . in our previous studies , we established a framework determining the responses to enzyme perturbations only from network topology , and then proved a theorem , called the law of localization , explaining response patterns in terms of network topology . in this paper , we generalize these results to reaction networks with conserved concentrations , which allows us to study any reaction systems . </S>",
