    "hd  14437 is a poorly studied peculiar a  star with a magnitude of @xmath1 , effective temperature @xmath2 ( glagolevskij , 1995 ) .",
    "observations of the 1980s with the 6-m telescope showed a variability of the longitudinal magnetic field with an amplitude of about 2 kg and a constant negative sign .",
    "the description of the observations and data reductions are presented by glagolevskij et al .",
    "( 1985 ) in more details .",
    "in this paper we present new observations of hd  14437 which were carried out in 199697 using the ccd detector ( chuntonov & glagolevskij , 1997 ) . we have observed the spectra of the star on the 6-m telescope with a spectral resolution @xmath3 .",
    "the context nice ( knyazev & shergin , 1995 ) in the midas system was used .",
    "the new and old observational data are presented in table  [ observations ] ( jd  24446552445900 : with photographic plates , jd  2449555 and jd  2449556 : with the hydrogen lines magnetometer , from jd  2450000 on : with the ccd detector ) .",
    "we have carried out the line identification using the vienna astrophysical line data  base ( vald ) ( piskunov et al . , 1995 ) and moore s tables ( moore , 1945 ) . in view of determining the individual land factor of each spectral line used in our measurements",
    ", we have identified the lines in the following spectral ranges : @xmath459556385 and @xmath444604680 .",
    "si and cr are observed to be overabundant .",
    "we have found an underabundance of o by the lack of the lines oi  @xmath46155.97 , 6556.78 and 6158.18 which are usually strong at spectral class a2 .",
    "we have determined the effective magnetic field using babcock s standard formula with the individual land factor  @xmath5 for each line .",

    "the suggestion about the long period of the star contradicts our data , because we have observed the longitudinal component of the magnetic field to undergo significant changes within a few days only .",
    "so , we can draw the conclusion that the axis of rotation , the magnetic axis and the line of sight are inclined at small angles .",
    "having the observational data of the effective magnetic field @xmath34 , we tried to find the rotational period of hd 14437 .",
    "it has been determined by yurkevich s method in the interval of 0100 days .",
    "we have found three groups of probable periods : 13 , 16 and 30 days .",
    "the best fitted variability curve of @xmath34 was derived for the period of @xmath35 .",
    "independently , a search for the period has been performed by mathys et al .",
    "( 1997 ) on the basis of the surface field @xmath36 .",
    "they have found three groups of probable periods : 15 , 30 and 350 days .",
    "later , wade ( 1997 ) proposed another period , close to @xmath37 , which he has calculated using 100 points of hipparcos photometry .",
    "the variability curve of the effective magnetic field for @xmath37 looks somewhat worse than for @xmath35 because of greater dispersion , nethertheless it remains quite acceptable . besides",
    ", determination of the period by photometry , with a much larger number of homogeneous points , undoubtedly gives a more reliable result .",
    "the @xmath34 phase diagram for @xmath38 is presented in figure  [ curv26 ] .",
    "we would like to thank v.  g.  elkin for his help in observations and discussions of the results , and g.  wade for the information about the 26 days period of hipparcos photometry .",
    "this work was partly supported by a rfbr grant 970216247 ."
