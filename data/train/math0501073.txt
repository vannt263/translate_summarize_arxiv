    "a graph @xmath5 is a minor of a graph @xmath6 if @xmath5 can be obtained from a subgraph of @xmath6 by contracting edges .",
    "if @xmath7 is the set of contracted edges , we call a connected component of the graph @xmath8 a _ prevertex_. upon contraction of @xmath7 , each prevertex becomes a vertex of @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear from the many excluded minor theorems , the connections between minors and surface embeddings , and robertson and seymour s graph minor theorem ( see e.g.@xcite,@xcite ) that studying minors is an excellent way to study graph structure .",
    "perhaps the first important result to make use of minors was kuratowski s theorem .",
    "we state wagner s reformulation ( see e.g. @xcite )    a graph is planar if and only if it has no @xmath9 or @xmath10 minor .    long before this , in 1852 , francis guthrie formulated the four - color theorem , which states that every loopless planar graph is 4-colorable @xcite .",
    "kuratowski s theorem gave a new way to study the four - color conjecture . in 1937 wagner proved that the statement `` every loopless graph with no @xmath9 minor is 4-colorable '' is equivalent to the four - color conjecture ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in 1943 hadwiger and dirac proved that every loopless graph with no @xmath11 minor is 3-colorable , and hadwiger conjectured that ( see e.g. @xcite )    for @xmath12 , every loopless graph with no @xmath13 minor is @xmath14-colorable .",
    "if true , this is a marvellously simple connection between complete minors and chromatic number , and is therefore considered one of the most important problems in graph theory .",
    "it has proved to be as difficult as it is beautiful . in 1977 ,",
    "appel and haken proved the four - color conjecture , but it was extremely complicated and computer assisted ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "robertson , sanders , seymour , and thomas cleaned up the proof , but it is still computer assisted @xcite . in 1993 , robertson , seymour , and thomas proved that the four - color theorem is equivalent to hadwiger s conjecture for @xmath15 @xcite . at present , hadwiger s conjecture has been proved for @xmath16 and is open for all @xmath17 .",
    "we investigate hadwiger s conjecture in another regime  when @xmath18 is comparable to the number of vertices in the graph .",
    "it is thought that if hadwiger s conjecture is false , this is the most likely place for a counterexample .",
    "we restrict our attention to the case where @xmath19 has no stable set of size 3 .",
    "this implies that there are at least @xmath20 color classes in a proper coloring of @xmath6 ; hadwiger s conjecture implies that @xmath6 has a complete minor of size at least @xmath20 .",
    "a strengthening conjectured by seymour is    [ mainconjecture ] if @xmath19 has no stable set of size 3 , then @xmath6 has a complete minor of size at least @xmath20 using only edges or single vertices as prevertices .",
    "we call this the ssh conjecture ; ss stands for seymour s strengthening and stable set and h stands for hadwiger .",
    "our main result states that ssh is true if the edges of @xmath6 can be partitioned into two sets with certain properties .",
    "we also show that this condition is satisfied by some reasonably interesting classes of graphs ( graphs whose complement is 3-colorable , for example ) .",
    "we strongly believe ssh is true because many attempts at constructing counterexamples have failed . however , our intuition for graphs with no stable set of size three is severely limited .",
    "we have much difficulty constructing graphs that our results do not apply to  graphs with no stable set of size 3 , large connectivity , no dominating edges , and large chromatic number in the complement .",
    "the only random graphs we can construct with these properties are extremely dense and have large complete minors .    before stating our results , we need some notation . if @xmath21 and @xmath22 are sets , @xmath21 _ intersects _ @xmath22 means @xmath23 .",

    "we will say that the vertex sets @xmath42 and @xmath27 _ touch _ if they intersect or there is some edge with an end in each set .",
    "we will also speak of two edges touching or an edge and a vertex touching ; we just identify the edge @xmath38 with the set @xmath44 and use the notion of touching just mentioned .",
    "we say @xmath42 is _ complete _ ( _ anticomplete _ ) to @xmath27 if every ( no ) edge @xmath38 @xmath45 is present .",
    "if @xmath37 is a vertex , @xmath46 will denote its set of neighbors ( and will not include @xmath47 ) ; if @xmath27 is a vertex set , @xmath48 .",

    "vertex _ duplication _ is the action of replacing a vertex by two non - adjacent vertices with the same neighbors as the original .",
    "unfortunately , these are the standard definitions of twins and duplication , but we want a `` complementary '' definition .",
    "we say vertices @xmath39 , @xmath37 are _ c - twins _ if they are adjacent and @xmath49 ; c stands for complement and clique .",

    "let @xmath51 be the set of graphs with no antitriangle .",
    "a simple but important observation is that a minimal counterexample to ssh has no dominating edges .",
    "in fact , we can win in two ways .",
    "if @xmath6 has a dominating edge , @xmath52 , then we can use @xmath53 as a prevertex together with a minor on @xmath54 found inductively . or we observe that @xmath55 , and by induction find a complete minor on it .",
    "another preliminary result gives a lower bound on the connectivity of a counterexample to ssh .",
    "[ cutset ] if @xmath56 and has a cut set , @xmath57 , of size at most @xmath58 , then ssh holds .",

    "@xmath6 has no antitriangle implies that @xmath63 and @xmath62 are cliques and that every vertex in @xmath57 is either complete to @xmath63 or complete to @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath65 partition @xmath57 so that every vertex in @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is complete to @xmath63 ( @xmath62 ) .",

    "now let @xmath73 be a matching from @xmath74 to @xmath62 of size @xmath75 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath63 , together with the edges of @xmath73 are the prevertices of a complete minor ( any pair of edges in @xmath76 is adjacent because they both have an end in the clique @xmath62 ) .",
    "we can , of course , do the same thing with vertices from @xmath62 and a matching from @xmath67 to @xmath63 .",
    "so without loss of generality @xmath77 by the assumption that @xmath78 and connectivity @xmath79 .",
    "nevertheless , it appears this lemma does away with some pathological cases that would otherwise present problems for a nice proof of the general result .",
    "in fact , we conjecture that if @xmath6 has no cutset of size @xmath58 or smaller and no dominating edge , then @xmath6 has a minor with any vertex @xmath80 as a prevertex and all the other prevertices as edges .",
    "we can easily find graphs with no such minor , but all of them we found have dominating edges or a small cut set .",
    "for example , in the graph in figure [ cutsetcountere ] , there is no @xmath9 minor that uses @xmath81 as a prevertex .",
    "let @xmath82 be the erds - renyi random graph in which there are @xmath30 vertices and edges are independently present with probability @xmath83 .",
    "for every constant @xmath83 , @xmath84 , hadwiger s conjecture is true for almost all graphs in @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely ( though possibly still worth thinking about ) that a reasonable random graph model will yield a counterexample to hadwiger s conjecture or ssh .",
    "nonetheless , random graphs provide an aid to our intuition by helping us think about graphs we can not construct .",
    "we show some computations that suggest ssh holds for almost all graphs in @xmath82 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "for a graph in @xmath82 , the expected number of @xmath89 minors using only sets of size one or two as prevertices tends to infinity as @xmath30 tends to infinity .",
    "if @xmath30 is odd , let @xmath90 .",
    "the probability that @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 are the prevertices of a complete minor is @xmath96 the terms in this product are the probability that @xmath97 is an edge , that the prevertices of size 2 touch each other , and that @xmath95 touches the prevertices of size 2 . substituting @xmath98 for @xmath81 we obtain @xmath99 using the expansion @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 @xmath102 since @xmath103 .",
    "there are @xmath104 distinct sets of prevertices of the above type . using stirling s approximation",
    ", there is a constant @xmath105 so that this is @xmath106 @xmath107 combining ( [ probeq ] ) and ( [ probeq2 ] ) , the expected number of complete minors of this type is at least @xmath108 which tends to infinity as @xmath30 goes to infinity .",
    "a similar ( and slightly simpler ) argument works for @xmath30 even .    showing that ssh holds for almost all graphs ( with @xmath83 as above ) requires a second moment calculation .",
    "this seems doable but tedious , and we do not do it .",
    "we have yet to say anything about graphs with no antitriangle .",
    "the expected number of antitriangles in @xmath109 is @xmath110 .",
    "for there to be asymptotically no antitriangles , we must have @xmath111 . a trick from ramsey theory",
    "is to add edges to destroy antitriangles ; this does not mess up the graph s properties too much if @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath113 is decreased , such a strategy becomes less effective , and this graph model can say little about graphs with no antitriangle .",
    "it therefore need not worry us that when @xmath114 , the expected number of minors of the type above tends to 0 .",
    "one approach to hadwiger s conjecture for graphs with no antitriangle is to try to show there is a complete minor of size @xmath115 for some constant @xmath116 , rather than demanding @xmath117 .",
    "even this weakening is unsolved for ssh .",
    "we present the progress made in this direction , and begin with an instructive result observed independently by mader , kelmans , and seymour .    if @xmath118 , then @xmath6 has a @xmath119 minor",
    ".    we can obtain such a minor using induced paths of length 2 and single vertices as prevertices .",
    "if @xmath120 are the vertices of an induced path of length 2 , because there is no antitriangle , @xmath121 = @xmath122 . choose a maximum number of vertex disjoint induced paths of length 2 .",
    "let their vertex sets be @xmath123 and let @xmath124 . in @xmath125 ,",
    "there are no induced paths of length 2 , so being connected by an edge is an equivalence relation .",
    "thus @xmath125 is the disjoint union of at most two cliques ; let @xmath126 be the largest clique of @xmath125 . @xmath127 and the vertices of @xmath126 are the prevertices of a @xmath128 minor .",
    "@xmath129 implies @xmath130",
    ".    induced paths of length 2 are a bit of a cheat because they let us ignore the complex structure of these graphs .",
    "for this reason the following problems are of interest .    show that there is a constant    _ ( ) _    @xmath131 such that for every @xmath132 , @xmath6 has a @xmath133 minor .",
