    "the idea of encoding quantum information in spin states of electrons confined in quantum dots ( qds ) is considered to be one of the most promising approaches to solid - state quantum computing .",
    "the original proposal of using single spins as quantum bits @xcite was followed by more sophisticated concepts in which a logical qubit was to be coded in a system of a few spins @xcite .",
    "a class of proposed implementations uses two - spin states in double quantum dots ( dqds ) , assigning the quantum logical values to singlet and triplet spin configurations @xcite .",
    "state - of - the - art experimental techniques allow one to manipulate spin states of two electrons in a lateral , gate - defined dqd on time scales of hundreds of nanoseconds @xcite , which has led to a renewed interest in factors that limit spin coherence .",
    "from the point of view of coherent quantum applications , two kinds of decoherence are of interest .",
    "one is spin relaxation ( thermalization of occupations ) between the selected basis states ( qubit states ) .",
    "the other one is dephasing of superpositions made of these states .",
    "such a process , often referred to as _ pure dephasing _ , does not affect the occupations of the qubit basis states , thus conserving the classical information encoded in the system .",
    "however , by destroying quantum coherence , it degrades the quantum bit to a classical one and hence is detrimental for quantum information storage or processing .",
    "moreover , if the system is initially prepared in a superposition of the basis states , the pure dephasing process will lead to a decay of this state . for a single electron ( where the qubit states are usually associated with the zeeman levels ) , this is equivalent to a decay of transverse components of the spin @xcite .",
    "experimental results show that spin relaxation time between the zeeman levels can be as long as milliseconds @xcite .",
    "similar values are obtained for relaxation of singlet - triplet superpositions in two - electron systems in double dots @xcite .",
    "the triplet - singlet relaxation rate rapidly decreases already when the magnetic field reaches @xmath0  t @xcite .",
    "experimentally observed spin decoherence can be accounted for by theoretical models based on hyperfine coupling to the magnetic moments of lattice ions @xcite . at higher fields , when the electron zeeman splitting becomes much larger than the nuclear one , also phonon - assisted processes become important for spin relaxation .",
    "the latter may either result from an interplay of hyperfine and carrier - phonon interactions @xcite or are mediated by the spin - orbit coupling @xcite . in a nearly degenerate singlet - triplet system , the hyperfine decoherence channel is predicted to persist even at strong magnetic fields @xcite .    in strong contrast to these long relaxation times , the phase coherence observed in experiments decays many orders of magnitude faster .",
    "time - averaged coherence times ( @xmath1 ) down to tens of nanoseconds have been observed @xcite , while applying coherent control techniques yields an estimate of the intrinsic value on the order of a microsecond @xcite .    in this paper , we show theoretically that an efficient pure dephasing channel is always present in systems of two electron spins localized in coupled semiconductor qds .",
    "this channel results solely from the charge - phonon interaction in the presence of inter - dot tunnel coupling , and is essentially due to the distinguishability of singlet and triplet states via pauli - blocking of certain transitions in the triplet case .",
    "the key feature of this decoherence process is that it does not require any spin - environment interaction and relies only on the mechanisms ( tunnel coupling and the pauli principle ) that are essential for the implementation of quantum gates . in particular",
    ", it appears also in materials with negligible spin - orbit and hyperfine couplings and is essentially independent of the magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mechanism ] , we qualitatively explain the mechanism of dephasing . next , in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] we define the model to be studied and in sec .  [ sec : dynamics ] we discuss its dynamics and derive the dephasing rates .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "qualitatively , in the lowest energy state of the two - electron system , each dot is occupied by a single electron .",
    "the spin configuration of the system may then be either singlet or triplet . in the former case , the orbital ( spatial ) wave function is symmetric and a transition to a doubly occupied state is possible @xcite .",
    "this is forbidden by pauli exclusion in the triplet configuration with an anti - symmetric orbital part .",
    "such transitions are inefficient at sub - kelvin temperatures because the doubly occupied state has a higher energy and the occupation of the required phonon states is negligible .",
    "however , a two - phonon process is still possible , in which the absorption of a phonon is followed by the re - emission of another one @xcite .",
    "in such a process , the doubly occupied state is involved only `` virtually '' and energy conservation requires only that the two phonons have the same energy ( that is , the scattering is elastic ) but this energy can be arbitrary . therefore , even at low temperatures , phonons scatter on a dqd in the singlet state , while a dqd in the triplet state is transparent to phonons . in this way",
    ", the singlet and triplet states can be distinguished by the macroscopic environment and each scattering event builds up correlation between the spin system and the crystal lattice .",
    "this distinguishability leads to pure dephasing of any singlet ",
    "triplet superposition , in some sense analogous to the `` collisional decoherence '' of the orbital degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "although the intensity of this process drops down at low temperatures because of decreasing two - phonon spectral density at low frequencies , the temperature dependence is only polynomial ( as opposed to exponential suppression of real transitions ) .",
    "as we will show , at sub - kelvin temperatures , at which spin coherent control experiments on dqds are performed , the two - phonon process can still lead to pure dephasing times as low as tens or hundreds of microseconds .",
    "as the discussed process is phonon - assisted it is characterized by a large degree of irreversibility .",
    "this follows from the dispersive nature of the phonon reservoir which results in correlations with a macroscopic number of uncontrollable lattice degrees of freedom built up over the typical memory time of a phonon bath , which is on the order of a few picoseconds .",
    "in order to quantitatively estimate the effect of the dephasing process discussed above we consider two electrons in laterally coupled quantum dots interacting with a phonon reservoir . the dots are considered identical and the model is restricted to the ground state in each dot .",
    "this simplifying assumption strictly holds only when the coulomb interaction between two electrons in a single dot is smaller than the single - particle excitation energy . otherwise",
    ", virtual transitions to excited states would provide another scattering channel .",
    "however , such scattering takes place both in the singlet and triplet states and can only yield distinguishability information due to the small exchange - related energy shifts between the relevant states and to the slight difference between the carrier densities in the lowest singlet and triplet states .",
    "thus , in general , the scattering via excited single - particle states might lead to quantitative corrections to our results but it should not be expected to dominate the contribution from the channel described in sec .  [",
