    "we now apply the weighted selection lemma ( lemma  [ lemma_weighted ] ) to @xmath60 , obtaining a multiset @xmath63 of segments delimited by @xmath64 distinct endpoints , all segments containing some point @xmath65 in their interior , with @xmath66     pairing two triangles with a common base . ]",

    "note that the vertical segments in @xmath77 are all distinct , since each such segment @xmath76 uniquely determines the originating points @xmath69 , @xmath71 , @xmath70 , @xmath15 ( assuming @xmath65 was chosen in general position ) .",
    "let @xmath78 be the number of endpoints of the segments in @xmath77 .",
    "we have @xmath79 , since each endpoint ( such as @xmath72 ) is uniquely determined by one of @xmath64 `` inner '' vertices ( such as @xmath15 ) and one of at most @xmath1 `` outer '' vertices ( such as @xmath69 ) .",
    "next , apply the unweighted selection lemma ( lemma  [ lemma_unw ] ) to @xmath77 , obtaining a point @xmath80 that is contained in @xmath81 segments in @xmath77 .",
    "thus , @xmath82 is contained in at least these many _ unions of pairs of triangles _ of @xmath54 .",
    "but by ( [ eq_bound_m_ab ] ) , each triangle in @xmath54 participates in at most @xmath83 pairs .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 is contained in @xmath84 triangles of @xmath54 .",
    "eppstein @xcite also showed that there always exists a point in @xmath85 contained in @xmath86 triangles of @xmath2 .",
    "this latter bound is stronger than ( [ eq_bound_log2 ] ) for small @xmath3 , namely for @xmath87 .    on the other hand , as eppstein also showed @xcite , for every @xmath1-point set @xmath0 in general position and every @xmath88 , @xmath89 , there exists a set @xmath2 of @xmath3 triangles with vertices in @xmath0 , such that no point in the plane is contained in more than @xmath90 triangles of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , with the current lack of any better lower bound , the bound ( [ eq_bound_log2 ] ) appears to be far from tight . even achieving a lower bound of @xmath91 , without any logarithmic factors ,",
    "is a major challenge still unresolved .",
    "it is known , however , that if @xmath0 is a set of @xmath1 points in @xmath92 in general position ( no four points on a plane ) , and @xmath2 is a set of @xmath3 triangles spanned by @xmath0 , then there exists a _ line _",
