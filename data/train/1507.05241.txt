    "it is known that @xmath7 is ambient isotopic to @xmath3 if and only if @xmath8 and @xmath9 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the knot group of the two - bridge knot @xmath3 has a presentation of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 are meridians , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we will call this presentation the schubert presentation of the knot group of @xmath3 .",
    "we now study representations of knot groups into @xmath14 . a representation is called nonabelian if its image is a nonabelian subgroup of @xmath14 .",
    "suppose @xmath15 is a nonabelian representation .",
    "up to conjugation , one can assume that @xmath16 \\quad \\text{and } \\quad \\rho(b ) = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } s & 0 \\\\ 2-y & s^{-1 } \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 satisfy the matrix equation @xmath19 .",
    "riley @xcite showed that this matrix equation is actually equivalent to a single polynomial equation @xmath20 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath21 is called the riley polynomial of @xmath3 .",
    "it can be chosen so that @xmath22 , and hence it can be considered as a polynomial in the variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 . note that @xmath25 and @xmath26 . with these new variables , we write @xmath27 for the riley polynomial of @xmath3 .",
    "see @xcite for an alternative description of @xmath27 in terms of traces .",
    "a nonabelian representation of a knot group into @xmath14 is called parabolic if the trace of a meridian is equal to @xmath28 .",
    "the zero set in @xmath29 of the polynomial @xmath30 of a two - bridge knot @xmath31 describes the set of all parabolic representations of the knot group of @xmath31 into @xmath14 , see @xcite .",
    "riley made the following conjecture about the relationship between the number of real roots of @xmath30 and the signature @xmath32 of @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite suppose @xmath31 is a two - bridge knot .",
    "then the equation @xmath33 has at least @xmath34 real solutions .    in this note",
    "we will verify conjecture 1 for a large class of two - bridge knots , called double twist knots .",
    "let @xmath35 be the two - bridge knot / link in figure 1 , where @xmath36 denote the numbers of half twists in the boxes .",

    "the main results of this note are as follows .",
    "[ main1 ] suppose @xmath40 and @xmath41 are positive integers .",
    "if @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 , then    \\(i ) the equation @xmath47 has exactly one real solution @xmath24 , and    \\(ii ) the equation @xmath48 has no real solutions @xmath24 ,    [ main2 ] suppose @xmath40 and @xmath41 are positive integers .",
    "if @xmath45 satisfies @xmath49 , then    \\(i ) the equation @xmath50 has at least @xmath51 real solutions @xmath24 , and    \\(ii ) the equation @xmath52 has at least @xmath41 real solutions @xmath24 .    as a consequence of theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] we have the following .",
    "conjecture 1 holds true for double twist knots .",
    "results in theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] are related to the problem of determining the existence of real parabolic representations in the study of left - orderability of the fundamental groups of cyclic branched covers of two - bridge knots , see @xcite .",
    "a group @xmath53 is called left - orderable if there exists a strict total ordering @xmath54 on its elements such that @xmath55 implies @xmath56 for all elements @xmath57 .",
    "left - orderable groups have attracted much attention because of its connection to l - spaces , a class of rational homology 3-spheres defined by ozsvath and szabo @xcite using heegaard floer homology , via a conjecture of boyer , gordon and watson @xcite .",
    "this conjecture states that an irreducible rational homology 3-sphere is an l - space if and only if its fundamental group is not left - orderable .    in @xcite",
    "a sufficient condition for the fundamental group of the @xmath58 cyclic branched cover of @xmath0 along a prime knot to be left - orderable is given , in terms of representations of the knot group .",
    "in particular , from the proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.3 ) it follows that if the knot group of a two - bridge knot @xmath31 has a real parabolic representation then the @xmath58 cyclic branched cover of @xmath0 along @xmath31 has left - orderable fundamental group for sufficiently large @xmath41 .",
