    "it can be seen that the crossed field limit gives the overstated result which is in orders of magnitude greater than the sum of the contributions of lower excited landau levels .",
    "on the other hand , the results with @xmath81 created at the ground landau level give the main contribution to the energy deposition rate , and almost exhaust it at @xmath166 .",

    "the exact solutions were used of the dirac equation for an electron in a magnetic field , which are simultaneously the eigenfunctions of the covariant operator of a magnetic polarization .",
    "this allowed to calculate the partial amplitudes corresponding to different polarization states of the electrons and positrons in a manifestly relativistic invariant form .",
    "the results obtained should be used for calculations of the efficiency of the electron - positron plasma production by neutrinos in the conditions of the kerr black hole accretion disk , regarded by experts as the most likely source of a short cosmological gamma - ray burst . in those conditions ,",
