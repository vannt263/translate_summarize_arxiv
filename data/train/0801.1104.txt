    "arbitrary quantum states can not be copied perfectly according to the quantum mechanical no - cloning theorem @xcite . however , there are optimal quantum cloning protocols that lead to imperfect , approximate copies resembling the input state just as much as allowed by quantum theory .",
    "this quantum cloning plays an important role in quantum information and quantum communication .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that quantum cloning might improve the performance of some computational tasks @xcite .",
    "quantum cloning also represents a potential eavesdropping attack in quantum cryptographic protocols @xcite .",
    "an approximate , optimal quantum cloning machine was first considered by buzek and hillery @xcite .",
    "their cloner operates in the domain of discrete variables and acts upon qubit states .",
    "later , quantum cloning was extended to the continuous - variable ( cv ) regime by cerf et al .",
    "continuous - variable quantum cloning has been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "this interest has been partly motivated by the fact that preparing and manipulating optical , gaussian , cv quantum states is relatively easy compared to other implementations .",
    "there are various theoretical proposals for an experimental realization of cv quantum cloning @xcite .",
    "these first proposals rely upon linear optics , and , in addition , on the optical amplification of the input states .",
    "the cloned states in these schemes are produced locally , from a number of identical copies of the signal state .",
    "we refer to this kind of quantum cloning as _ local , conventional _ cloning .",
    "a more recent experimental realization of local , conventional cloning of optical coherent states was achieved without amplification , using only linear optics , homodyne detection , and feedforward @xcite . according to another interesting proposal of this kind of cloning @xcite ,",
    "approximate copies of an optical quantum state appear in two atomic ensembles .",
    "there has also been a lot of interest in quantum _ nonlocal _ cloning ( telecloning ) , which is a combination of quantum cloning and teleportation to more than just one receiver .",
    "the aim of telecloning is to broadcast information of an unknown quantum state from a sender to several spatially separated receivers exploiting multipartite entanglement as a multi - user quantum channel . for continuous variables , the first proposal for optimal @xmath1 telecloning of coherent states",
    "is based upon an @xmath2-partite entangled multi - mode gaussian state @xcite .",
    "the protocol itself , similar to one - to - one quantum teleportation @xcite , uses beam splitters , homodyne detection , and feedforward . in this case , the anticlones ( phase - conjugate clones , or time - reversed state ) are lost ; thus , optimal telecloning can be achieved by exploiting nonmaximum , effectively bipartite entanglement produced from _",
    "finitely _ squeezed light via linear optics .",
    "this scheme ( see also @xcite ) is regarded as the cv _",
    "irreversible _ telecloner , analogous to the irreversible telecloner in the domain of discrete variables @xcite .",
    "recently , irreversible telecloning of optical coherent states was demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "in addition , cv _",
    "reversible _ telecloning was proposed @xcite , in which the information of an unknown quantum state is , in principle , transferred without loss from a sender to several spatially separated receivers , again exploiting multipartite entanglement as a multi - user quantum channel . however , in this case , optimal reversible telecloning requires maximum bipartite entanglement ; hence infinite squeezing would be needed to build the corresponding multi - mode entangled state @xcite .        an important work on quantum state estimation has revealed that more quantum information can be encoded in antiparallel pairs of spins than in parallel pairs @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a similar result was obtained in the cv regime , where a pair of conjugate gaussian states carries more information than a pair of identical coherent states @xcite .",
    "these results enable one to achieve better fidelities with a cloning machine admitting antiparallel input qubits or phase - conjugate input coherent states , compared to the conventional case with identical input copies .",
    "based upon the above properties , fiursek proposed a cloning machine for antiparallel spin states @xcite .",
    "similarly , cerf and iblisdir derived a cv cloning transformation @xcite that uses @xmath3 copies of a coherent state and @xmath4 copies of its complex conjugate as input states , and produces @xmath0 optimal clones of the coherent state and @xmath5 phase - conjugate clones ( anticlones , or time reversed states ) .",
    "this is the first scheme for a local , phase - conjugate input ( pci ) cloner of continuous variables .",
    "nonetheless , an experimental realization of the proposed pci cloner is difficult , as it requires `` online '' optical parametric amplification .",
    "recently , a much simpler and efficient cv pci cloning machine based on linear optics , homodyne detection , and feedforward was proposed @xcite and implemented experimentally @xcite .",
    "note that the production of an infinite number of clones ( @xmath6 ) coincides with optimal or perfect state estimation @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath0 clones and @xmath7 anticlones from two identical replicas gives the optimal telecloning fidelity of @xmath8 for @xmath9 and maximally epr entangled state .",
    "this is consistent with the standard optimal value of @xmath8 for @xmath10 cloning of coherent states that was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the pci telecloner yields the better fidelity of @xmath11 owing to the added information in the phase - conjugate input state .",
    "the result of the increased fidelity of @xmath11 for coherent states with phase - conjugate input modes indicates that the added information in the input state must be equivalent to the @xmath10 cloning of a single mode coherent state with known phase , where the fidelity is also @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "a summary of the various quantum cloning schemes and their realizations is shown in table 1 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a protocol of cv reversible _ telecloning _ of coherent states with _ phase - conjugate _ input modes . the @xmath12 quantum telecloning machine yields @xmath0 identical clones and @xmath0 identical anticlones from @xmath3 copies of a coherent state and @xmath3 phase - conjugate copies . here",
    ", we consider two cases of pci telecloning . in the first case ,",
    "pci telecloning produces @xmath0 clones nonlocally and @xmath0 anticlones locally , or vice versa .",
    "alternatively , both clones and anticlones may be created nonlocally through pci telecloning .",
    "optimal cloning fidelities of this pci telecloning require perfect epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) entanglement , i.e. , infinite two - mode squeezing as a resource .",
    "however , similar to the conventional ( irreversible ) cv telecloning scheme @xcite , no `` online '' optical parametric amplification is needed .",
    "as shown in table 1 , pci telecloning of qubit states has not been investigated yet .",
    "hence our protocol represents a nice example , where a cv quantum information protocol is proposed before its qubit counterpart .",

    "[ fig1 ] , width=316 ]    the essence of quantum telecloning is the multipartite entanglement shared among the sender and the receivers . without multipartite entanglement , it is only possible to perform the corresponding two - step protocol : the sender produces clones and anticlones locally , and then ( bipartitely ) teleports them to each receiver",
    ". the two - step protocol would require @xmath34 bipartite entanglement for teleportation .",
    "continuous - variable pci telecloning with nonlocal clones and local anticlones only requires one resource of bipartite entanglement .",
    "the bipartite entangled state of cv is a two - mode gaussian entangled state ( epr entangled state ) , which can be obtained directly by type - ii parametric interaction @xcite or indirectly by mixing two independent squeezed beams on a beam - splitter @xcite .",
