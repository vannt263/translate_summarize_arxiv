    "the minimum density a periodic identifying code in @xmath0 is exactly the minimum cycle mean of @xmath81 divided by @xmath1 .",
    "we next show that the infimum density of an identifying code in @xmath0 can always be achieved by a periodic identifying code with pattern length bounded by a function of @xmath1 :    [ thm : periodic ] for any @xmath11 , there is a periodic identifying code @xmath91 with pattern length @xmath92 in @xmath0 satisfying @xmath93 .",

    "then simply repeating the pattern @xmath78 of @xmath117 $ ] results in an identifying code too .",
    "let @xmath100 denote this periodic identifying code in @xmath0 , with pattern length @xmath106 .",
    "note that @xmath121| + 4k$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath122| + 4k}{nk } = d(a[j ] , r[j ] ) + 4n^{-1 } \\le \\overline{d}(a_n , s_k ) + 4n^{-1 } \\le d^*(s_k ) + 5 n^{-1},\\ ] ] as desired in  .",
    "recall proposition  [ prp ] on the equivalence between patterns of periodic identifying codes in @xmath0 and cycles in @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath81 has at most @xmath2 vertices , any cycle in @xmath81 with more than @xmath2 edges must repeat some vertex .",
    "then the edges of the cycle can be partitioned to form two shorter cycles , and the mean weights of the two parts can not be both greater than that of the whole .",
    "correspondingly , if the length @xmath106 of the pattern @xmath78 exceeds @xmath2 , then we can replace @xmath78 by a shorter pattern with equal or smaller density .",
    "thus we can assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath100 is a periodic identifying code with pattern length at most @xmath2 .",
    "we have obtained an infinite sequence of periodic identifying codes @xmath100 , for @xmath99 , with pattern length at most @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath1 is finite , the number of distinct periodic identifying codes with pattern length at most @xmath2 is finite .",
    "so there must exist a periodic identifying code @xmath91 with pattern length at most @xmath2 , such that @xmath123 is identical to @xmath91 for an infinite sequence of increasing positive integers @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "then by   we have @xmath126 for @xmath127 , and consequently @xmath128 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm : periodic ] .",
    "we briefly review karp s algorithm  @xcite for computing the minimum cycle mean @xmath129 of a strongly connected directed graph @xmath23 with @xmath106 vertices and @xmath130 edges , where each edge @xmath131 has a weight @xmath132 .",
    "let @xmath89 be an arbitrary vertex in @xmath23 . for each vertex @xmath24",
    ", and each integer @xmath133 , define @xmath134 as the minimum weight of any edge progression of length @xmath1 from @xmath89 to @xmath26 ; if no such edge progression exists , then @xmath135 .",

    "the overall running time is @xmath137 .",
    "if the actual cycle yielding the minimum cycle mean is desired , it may be extracted from a minimum - weight edge progression of length @xmath106 between @xmath89 and the minimizing vertex @xmath26 in  .",
    "such edge progressions for all vertices @xmath26 can be recorded , in parallel to the computation of @xmath134 by  , by recording back references to the vertices @xmath141 of the minimizing edges @xmath142 .",
    "it is easy to verify that karp s algorithm remains valid for directed graphs with self - loops .",
    "now recall proposition  [ prp ] . by applying karp s algorithm to the directed graph @xmath81",
    "corresponding to the strip @xmath0 , we immediately have the following theorem :    for any @xmath11 , a minimum - density periodic identifying code in @xmath0 , with pattern length at most @xmath2 , can be found by karp s algorithm in @xmath143 time .    a straightforward implementation of karp s algorithm uses @xmath144 space for all values of @xmath134 and the corresponding back references to @xmath141 .",
    "the space for @xmath134 can be easily reduced to @xmath145 by running the dynamic programming algorithm in two passes . in each pass , by  , the values of @xmath146 for each @xmath11 depend only on @xmath147 .",
    "thus the space for @xmath134 in each round @xmath1 can be kept for the next round , while the space for @xmath148 can be recycled for @xmath149 . at the end of the first pass ,",
    "the values of @xmath150 are recorded . then in the second pass , with ready access to @xmath150 , we can compute @xmath151 for each @xmath26 on the fly , without keeping the values of @xmath134 for all @xmath1 . finally , after the second pass , we can compute @xmath152 in @xmath145 time .",
    "the overall running time remains @xmath137 .",
    "the @xmath144 space for the back references is harder to reduce .",
    "however , it turns out that in our application , a rather short cycle yielding the minimum cycle mean can be found near the end of the minimum - weight edge progression of length @xmath106 from @xmath89 to @xmath26 .",
    "thus we only need to record back references when @xmath1 gets close to @xmath106 in  , and hence can reduce the total space usage to @xmath153 .",
