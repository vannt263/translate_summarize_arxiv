    "typicaly , in thermodynamic limit the fs would diverge at the point @xmath21 corresponding to a quantum phase transition @xmath22 and for systems of a finite size @xmath1 the analysis of the scaling behavior of @xmath23 allows one to extract the critical exponent @xmath24 of the correlation length , @xmath25 and thus to determine the universality class of the transition .",
    "one of the most advanced unbiased numerical method for analyzing lattice models in reduced spatial dimensions is the density matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg ) , which is best suited for systems with open boundary conditions at least along one of the directions . in one dimension ( 1d ) ,",
    "systems with open boundaries consisting of @xmath26-@xmath27 sites can be efficiently analyzed by dmrg .",
    "hence , it is crucial to understand the dependence of the fs on the boundary conditions . for many types of the `` perturbation '' @xmath16",
    ", the fs depends only weakly on the boundary conditions for large systems .    in the present paper",

    "we study the current fs in several model systems , including spin chains , the hubbard model for spinful fermions , and the bose - hubbard model .",

    "the leading terms in the @xmath1 dependence are given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , where @xmath3 is the luttinger liquid parameter , @xmath9 is the characteristic `` sound '' velocity , and the numerical prefactors are universal .",
    "we show , by means of relating @xmath0 and @xmath32 to the behavior of the positive frequency conductivity @xmath33 , that those superextensive terms in the fs originate from the low - frequency behavior of the singular part of the conductivity .",
    "since those terms are universal , they can mask the diverging part of the fs at a phase transition point between two gapless regions .",
    "in contrast to that , for gapless systems with periodic boundary conditions ( p.b.c . ) the leading system size dependence of the current fs is linear , @xmath34 , in a wide range of the luttinger liquid parameter @xmath3 , and may change to a subquadratic one , @xmath35 with @xmath5 depending on @xmath3 , @xmath36 . at kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) metal - insulator transition point @xmath37 .    as a byproduct of this study , we establish the general properties of the low - frequency behavior of the conductivity in systems with open and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we emphasize a crucial difference in the behavior of conductivity in systems with p.b.c . and o.b.c . , which is responsible for the peculiar difference in the current fs properties .    in gapped phases",
    "the current fs is generically extensive , independent of boundary conditions , @xmath34 , but it may again acquire the quadratic system size dependence for topologically ordered states in systems with open boundary conditions , for example in the singlet ground state of the open haldane chain , due to non - locally entangled edge spins .",

    "we present two ways of calculating the current fs for open systems : one is based on the free - fermion picture and involves bosonization arguments for a generalization to the interacting case , and the other way is based on applying a unitary twist transformation and reducing the problem to calculating certain integrals of the ( spin ) density correlation function .",
