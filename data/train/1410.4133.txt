    "two lepton mixing angles are known to be large , yet there is no established theory which explains their values .",
    "one hypothesis is that the lepton flavour structure is explained by the existence of some finite symmetry which acts on flavour space . given that symmetry is known to play a critical role in fundamental physics , this is a particularly appealing possibility , which was explored extensively in the literature .",
    "however , most research has focused on building models which incorporate particular flavour symmetries , with little attention being given to the problem of systematically cataloging the various possibilities .",
    "references @xcite are notable exceptions , where the gap program @xcite was used to make scans over various groups and representations , yielding lists of lepton mixing matrices which can be obtained from finite flavour symmetries .",
    "however , even though these are interesting pioneering works in this area , by the very nature of such computational scans , they are necessarily partial since there are infinitely many groups to be searched . furthermore , it is useful to have not just a computational understanding of the problem , but an analytical one as well .    in @xcite",
    "we have done such a systematic study for the cases where the lepton mixing matrix is predicted completely by a finite discrete symmetry , leaving no relation between mixing angles and mass ratios .",
    "it is then appropriate to first briefly review the relation between this class of models and the residual symmetries of the lepton mass matrices . assuming that neutrinos are majorana particles , the mass terms of leptons are the following :",
    "@xmath0 a transformation @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 given by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 will impose @xmath7 as the lepton mixing matrix , provided that the eigenvalues of @xmath8 are distinct .",
    "matrices are needed . ] to be precise , given that this symmetry leaves the lepton masses completely unconstrained , one is able to impose that the absolute values of the entries of the mixing matrix are given by @xmath9 , up to row and column permutations of @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath10 matrices generate a group @xmath11 , which is infinite in general .",
    "however , it should be noted that the cases where @xmath11 is finite are particularly interesting and deserve special attention , as they provide a way to avoid having massless scalar particles .",
    "one can ask : when does @xmath8 and the @xmath12 generate a finite group ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on both @xmath7 and the eigenvalues of the @xmath8 matrix ( the @xmath13 ) .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was proven that for tribimaximal mixing ( tbm )  which was an acceptable ansatz until the reactor angle was measured to be appreciable  the resulting group is finite if and only if the eigenvalues of @xmath8 are @xmath14 up to permutations of these values and multiplication by a common root of unity ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "depending on this multiplicative root of unity , @xmath11 might be @xmath16 or some other group which contains it as a subgroup .",
    "it is therefore natural to associate tribimaximal mixing with the effective symmetry group @xmath16 .",
    "the technique used in @xcite to derive this connection relied on scanning all finite subgroups of @xmath17 ( as listed in @xcite ; see also @xcite ) and on analyzing their 3-dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "however , there is a simpler way to derive the same result .",
    "the finiteness of a group @xmath11 requires that the eigenvalues of its elements @xmath18 , in any representation , must be roots of unity .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that there is always some positive integer @xmath19 such that @xmath20 ( the identity element ) . as such",
    ", the eigenvalues of @xmath8 ( the @xmath13 ) as well as those of @xmath21 ( which we may call @xmath22 ) must all be roots of unity . computing the eigenvalues of the @xmath21 matrices as a function of those of @xmath8 can be done , but the expressions are in general complicated so , instead of looking at the @xmath22 individually , we may consider the combinations @xmath23 which are just the traces of the matrices @xmath21 ( no additional useful information is obtainable from @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "for @xmath26 , it is easy to check that @xmath27 this is a vanishing sum of roots of unity with integer coefficients , whose solutions can be found using theorem 6 of @xcite .",
    "there are two : either ( a ) @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , or ( b ) @xmath31 and @xmath32 for some roots of unity @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( up to permutations amongst the @xmath13/@xmath35 ) . solution ( a ) implies that the eigenvalues of @xmath8 are completely degenerate ( @xmath36 ) which is unacceptable from the physical point of view ( see section [ section1 ] ) . solution ( b ) is the one reported in @xcite .",
    "instead of just scanning the allowed @xmath13 for a particular value of @xmath7 , in @xcite we considered the problem in full generality , which resulted in the list of all the values of @xmath37 which lead to a finite group . to do so , we applied known results concerning roots of unity ( see also @xcite ) , without having to rely on the classification of the finite subgroups of @xmath17 , nor did we have to use group or representation theory .",
    "this is particularly relevant given that finding the finite subgroups of @xmath17 and their representations over the last century was not a straightforward task ( see @xcite ) .    in a first step",
    ", it can be shown that , up to row and column permutations , the representation matrix @xmath38 of any element of a finite group which contains the @xmath12 is of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is some rational angle ( @xmath41 , with @xmath42 ) .",
    "this applies to @xmath43 but also to @xmath44 , for example .",
    "it is then possible , in a second step , to enumerate all the possible @xmath8 s by knowing the allowed values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    given that the rows of @xmath47 are the eigenvectors of @xmath8 , we end up with a list of the lepton mixing matrices which are compatible with a finite flavor group @xmath11 .",
    "this list contains 17 sporadic @xmath7 s involving three - flavour mixing , as well as the infinite series of mixing matrices @xmath48 where @xmath49 can be any root of unity .",
    "the sporadic cases are associated with the minimal groups @xmath50 , @xmath16 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 and they are excluded by neutrino oscillation data at more than 3@xmath54 since they all predict either @xmath55 or @xmath56 equal or larger than @xmath57 .    that leaves the infinite series of equation  for @xmath58  as the only phenomenologically viable case ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "note that this type of mixing implies a @xmath59 reasonably far from maximal ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) , and a trivial dirac - type phase @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath19 is not divisible by 9 , it can be shown that the minimal group @xmath11 is @xmath63 , with @xmath64 ; otherwise @xmath11 is a semi - direct product of the form @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "plots showing the angles predicted by some of the mixing matrices which can be obtained with finite flavour symmetries ( figure taken from @xcite ) .",
    "the sporadic mixing matrices appear as dots , while the infinite series of @xmath7 s displayed in equation is represented as a red ( @xmath67 ) and a green ( @xmath68 ) line , depending on the column permutation which is considered .",
    "the numbers along the red curves indicate the values of @xmath69 .",
    "the gray areas indicate the 1 , 2 and @xmath70 regions allowed by neutrino oscillation experiments , as computed by forero et al .",
