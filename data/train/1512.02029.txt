    "@xcite for a detailed explanation about this phase ) . at this point ,",
    "a new phase transition takes place , causing a ssb down to the sm gauge group .",
    "we assume the set of vevs at this last step to be a global minimum for the potential , i.e. implying @xmath65 .",

    "we will also assume there is no symmetry restoration , i.e. all fields acquiring a non - zero vev at a given step keep it non vanishing at later stages .",
