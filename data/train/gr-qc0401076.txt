    "since many of the most interesting phenomena in astrophysics involve black holes , the modeling of black hole spacetimes is one the most important problems in numerical general relativity .",
    "it is also one of the most challenging problems .",
    "black hole evolutions present all the usual difficulties of numerical relativity , such as the need to find a stable form of the field evolution equations and the need to find a practical coordinate system .",
    "in addition , handling the singular region is very subtle for a numerical code ; the black hole singularity must be avoided to allow the exterior evolution to continue far into the future .",
    "one of the most promising methods to date of dealing with black hole singularities is black hole excision .",
    "this method , first suggested by unruh  @xcite , exploits the fact that the singularity resides inside an event horizon , a region that is casually disconnected from the rest of the universe . since no physical information propagates from inside the event horizon to outside , one should be able to evolve the exterior independent of the interior spacetime . inside the event horizon",
    ", causality entitles us to do anything which will produce a stable exterior evolution .",
    "in particular , one can excise a region inside the horizon containing the singularity and replace it with suitable boundary conditions at its outer surface .    although it is guaranteed that no physical signal can propagate from inside the horizon to outside , unphysical signals often can propagate in evolution codes .",
    "gauge modes can move acausally for many gauge conditions .",
    "although they carry no physical content , such modes may destabilize the code .",
    "thus , the choice of gauge is crucial to obtaining good excision evolutions .",
    "in addition , constraint - violating modes can , for some formulations of the field equations , propagate acausally , creating inaccuracies and instabilities .",
    "thus , the choice of formulation is also crucial to obtaining good excision evolutions .",
    "the feasibility of black hole excision was demonstrated in spherically symmetric 1 + 1 dimensional evolutions of a single black hole in the presence of a self - gravitating scalar field @xcite .",
    "excision was also implemented successfully to study the spherically symmetric collapse of collisionless matter to a black hole in brans - dicke theory  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional evolutions of black holes with excision were attempted by using the standard 3 + 1 adm formulation , for a stationary  @xcite and for a boosted black hole  @xcite .",
    "although the introduction of excision improved the behavior of these black hole simulations , long - term stability could not be achieved due to instabilities endemic to the unmodified adm formulation .    since then",
    ", new and more stable formulations of the 3 + 1 einstein field equations have been devised . using excision in a modified version of the adm equations commonly referred to as bssn  @xcite , several groups have evolved stationary black hole spacetimes ( non - spinning and spinning ) for arbitrarily long times  @xcite .",
    "long - term stability has also been achieved using hyperbolic formulations of the field equations  @xcite and using characteristic evolutions  @xcite .",
    "success has also been achieved in evolving distorted and moving black holes with excision , both with characteristic formalisms  @xcite and with bssn  @xcite .",
    "excision has also been used to simulate the grazing collision of two black holes  @xcite and to simulate binary black holes for approximately one orbital period  @xcite .",
    "the last several years also have seen significant advances in numerical , 3 + 1 relativistic hydrodynamics in dynamical spacetimes ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the simulation of rapidly rotating , relativistic stars is now possible , and fully relativistic evolution codes are being used to study the stability  @xcite and gravitational collapse  @xcite of such objects .",
    "binary neutron stars can now be evolved accurately for multiple orbits  @xcite , and numerical simulations have been used to study the final merger of these binaries  @xcite .",
    "the necessary tools are clearly being forged to enable numerical relativity to model a wide variety of strong - field gravitational phenomena .",
    "many interesting systems in astrophysics involve the simultaneous presence of both black holes and hydrodynamic matter fields , and these systems will require a code which can handle both in order to model them reliably .",
    "one important scenario involving both hydrodynamic matter and black holes is core collapse in massive stars , an event of immense importance due to its association with supernovae , the formulation of neutron stars and black holes , and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "some recent numerical simulations suggest  @xcite that a star must have mass less than about 20 @xmath5 for core collapse to result in a conventional neutron star and supernova explosion . for progenitor masses between around @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "the core collapses to a neutron star initially , but it eventually implodes to a black hole , as ejected material slowly falls back onto the remnant ( see also  @xcite ) . for more massive stars ,",
    "the core collapses promptly to a black hole .",
    "such a massive system is a promising candidate for a grb @xcite .",
    "there is growing evidence that long duration grbs are associated with hypernovae that accompany the collapse of massive stellar cores .",
    "this evidence includes the association of the low - energy grb980425 with a supernova  @xcite , the presence of supernova - like features in the optical afterglow of several grbs  @xcite , and the existence of freshly synthesized elements in the ejecta of grb 011211  @xcite .",
    "most recently , a hypernova was found to be temporally and spatially coincident with a normal cosmological burst source , grb 030329  @xcite .",
    "most models of the central engine of grbs involve a black hole surrounded by a rapidly accreting disk and a jet  @xcite .",
    "three dimensional fully relativistic simulations of both the black hole and the exterior matter will be needed to test the feasibility of various models for the production of grbs from such `` collapsars '' , and it is likely that excision will be required to track the full evolution .",
    "the merger of binary neutron stars is a promising source of gravitational waves , as well as a prime candidate for short duration grbs  @xcite .",
    "binary mergers of stars of high compaction collapse promptly to a black hole  @xcite .",
    "the coalescence of low - compaction neutron stars probably leads to the formation of a hypermassive neutron star remnant  @xcite followed by a delayed collapse  @xcite .",
    "either way , excision of the black hole singularities is necessary to follow binary mergers which form black holes with accretion disks , emit gravitational waves , and drive short - duration grbs .",
    "the dynamics of accretion flows onto a black hole is another problem of great importance , since black holes are usually visible electromagnetically only through accretion .",
    "when the mass of the accreting fluid is much less than that of the black hole , then the matter can be evolved on a fixed black hole spacetime .",
    "when the masses of the hole and the matter are comparable , then a fixed black hole spacetime becomes a bad approximation to the true metric , and the full system must be evolved self - consistently .",
    "this is particularly important for determining if and when the disk may produce an instability , as in the runaway instability  @xcite , or in the one - armed spiral instability  @xcite which can generate quasi - periodic gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "other coupled black hole - hydrodynamic matter systems include a neutron - star black hole binary , which might be an important source of gravitational radiation for ligo , and also the disruption or capture of a star by a massive black hole , which is expected to be a major source of waves for lisa  @xcite .",
    "supermassive black hole seed formation by the collapse of a massive or supermassive star is another important example  @xcite .",
    "successful attempts at evolving matter and a black hole together in a dynamical spacetime using excision have been rare .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite simulated the collapse of a spherically symmetric configuration of collisionless matter in brans - dicke theory with excision .",
    "the spacetime within the numerical domain was evolved until the appearance of an apparent horizon . at that time ,",
    "an excision boundary was introduced and the evolution of the exterior spacetime was continued . an attempt to evolve a dynamical black hole spacetime with hydrodynamic matter",
    "was undertaken by brandt _",
    "@xcite in axisymmetry . in that paper , a black hole",
    "is evolved with an accretion flow , using the adm formalism and an isometry inner boundary condition at the apparent horizon .",
    "they were able to evolve several systems for up to about 100@xmath0 .",
    "little progress has been made since then , presumably because the computational tools for performing excision and relativistic hydrodynamics in 3 + 1 had to be perfected independently .",
    "we have only now reached the stage where these tools can be put together successfully .    in this paper , we perform the first simulations which utilize excision to evolve relativistic hydrodynamic matter in 3 + 1 dynamical spacetimes containing black holes .",
    "in particular , we present evolutions of the gravitational collapse of stars from the beginning of collapse , through black hole formation , to quiescent final states .",
    "we perform these evolutions in two stages . from the beginning of collapse until the appearance of an apparent horizon , we evolve using our new , relativistic hydrodynamics ( bssn ) code without excision ( i.e. our `` pre - excision '' code ) . after an apparent horizon appears , we continue the evolution with a region inside the horizon excised . at the moment we introduce excision , a significant amount of matter is still outside the excision zone and the black hole is significantly distorted and in a nonstationary state .",
    "we follow its evolution to a final stationary state . in section  [ method ]",
    "we describe our evolution scheme , including our gauge and boundary conditions . in section [ diagnostics ]",
    "we describe our code diagnostics . in section  [ code_tests ]",
    "we test our code on systems with known behavior , including vacuum black holes , relativistic bondi accretion , oppenheimer - snyder collapse , and the collapse of unstable polytropes , both non - rotating and rotating .",
    "we find that we are able to evolve many systems stably for hundreds of @xmath0 .",

    "we find that stars with @xmath3 collapse to kerr black holes with no surrounding disks .",
    "stars with @xmath4 collapse to tori , which then fragment .",
    "this fragmentation process can produce copious amounts of gravitational radiation , originally referred to as `` splash radiation ''  @xcite . finally , we summarize our results and discuss future improvements to our code in section  [ discussion ] .    throughout this paper ,",

    "we have recently generalized this code using the cartoon methods of  @xcite so that it can perform 2 + 1 simulations in axisymmetry in the same coordinate system . in order to improve its behavior near the intersection of the excision zone and the symmetry axis , we add a small amount of kreiss - oliger dissipation  @xcite to the evolution equation for the extrinsic curvature @xmath10",
    ". a further description of our axisymmetry algorithms , together with axisymmetry code tests , will be presented in a forthcoming paper  @xcite , in which the effects of viscosity on differentially rotating binary neutron star remnants are studied .",
    "we evolve the field evolution equations using the bssn formulation @xcite . in the bssn system ,",
    "one decomposes the 3-metric as @xmath11 and the extrinsic curvature as @xmath12 , and one promotes the conformal connection coefficients @xmath13 to independent variables .",
    "one then uses the adm equations to write evolution equations for the new set of fundamental variables : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath10 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . on each time slice",
    ", these variables must satisfy the following constraint equations : @xmath18 these constraints are solved only at the initial time , and are used henceforward as diagnostics . in an attempt to improve the stability and accuracy of the bssn formulation , one can add multiples of the above constraints to the field equations .",
    "many possible modifications of this kind have recently been suggested @xcite .",

    "we have tried several boundary conditions for the matter variables , and have found that our results are insensitive to the choice , as they should be . in the runs described below , we simply set the matter variables equal to zero when they hit the excision zone , thus making the excision boundary a perfect one - way membrane .",
    "the lapse and shift must be chosen in such a way that the total system of evolution equations is stable .",
