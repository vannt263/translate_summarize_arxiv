    "polar - ring galaxies ( prgs ) are rare relics of galaxy interactions .",
    "the polar - ring galaxy catalogue ( prc , whitmore et al . 1990 ) contains only about 100 prgs and prg candidates in the northern and southern hemispheres . at present , at least half of all northern prgs and candidates have been investigated , southern objects have been studied less extensively ( except for a few well - known examples , e.g. ngc  4650a ) .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to collect new observational data on southern hemisphere prgs in order to enlarge the available information about this specific type of extragalactic objects .",
    "we discuss nuclear spectra of 8 prgs and candidates of the prc .    throughout this work",
    "the value h@xmath1=75 km @xmath2 is adopted .",
    "the observations were performed with the 1.6m - telescope at the observatrio do pico dos dias ( opd , brazil ) in may 1997 , equipped with a cassegrain spectrograph and ccd-05 - 20 - 0 - 202 detector @xmath3 ( thick , front - illuminated and coated for the uv ) with 770@xmath41152 square pixels , 22.5@xmath5 m each , 6.6@xmath6 readout noise , and 3.3 @xmath7 gain .",
    "the grating of 900 lines @xmath8 was centered at 665 nm , with a dispersion of 1.15 @xmath9 and resolution of 1.1 pixels ( fwhm ) .",
    "the slit size was 3 arcsec@xmath452 arcsec .",
    "the configuration yielded a scale factor of 0.235 arcsec @xmath10 and a spectral coverage of 5900   ",
    "the seeing during the observations was @xmath112 arcsec .",
    "the spectra were taken with the slit along the major axes of the central galaxies ( except for am  1837 - 631 ) .",
    "in general three 20 minute exposures were taken and coadded of each object , except for am  1934563 of which only one 20 min spectrum was obtained .",
    "a log of the observations is given in table  [ logobs ] .",
    "the reductions were carried out with standard techniques usingiraf and eso - midas packages .",
    "this includes bias subtraction , flat - field correction , cosmic rays removal , sky subtraction and wavelength calibration .",
    ".log of observations [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     @xmath12arctangent fit + @xmath13corrected for inclination    the general kinematical properties of the four polar - ring candidates for which the velocity profiles were measured are summarized in table  [ rc ] .",
    "the second and third columns of table  [ rc ] list the arctangent fit parameters v@xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the fourth column gives the maximum rotation velocity corrected for the inclination of the galaxy : v@xmath16=v@xmath14/sin@xmath17 , where the inclination @xmath17 is estimated from the apparent axial ratio . in the fifth column we present optical radii of the galaxies ( measured from the dss images ) , and",
    "the sixth column lists our estimate of the total galaxy mass within the optical radius under the assumption of a spherical mass distribution .",
    "the last two columns contain the ratio of mass to observed luminosity and the relative hi content , respectively . as can be seen from table  [ rc ]",
    ", polar - ring candidates show characteristics which are quite common for typical spiral galaxies ( the comparatively large value of m@xmath18/@xmath19 for am  1934 - 563 may be partially explained by its almost edge - on orientation ; the magnitude corrected to a face - on orientation may be as much as @xmath20 brighter ) .    in fig .",
    "[ tf ] we compare the tully - fisher relation for normal spiral galaxies ( broeils 1992 ) to that of our spiral polar - ring candidates . for the latter we used maximum rotation velocities corrected for inclination and absolute luminosities ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "as can be seen , two galaxies ( am  1934 - 563 and eso  500-g41 ) follow the relation for normal spirals , while two others ( eso  576-g69 and am  1837 - 631 ) have too large luminosities ( for fixed v@xmath21 ) or too small rotation velocities for their luminosity .",
    "probably both of these possible reasons can contribute to the observed deviations , as galaxy interactions and mergers can enhance optical luminosities as well as disturb emission - line velocity fields in the involved galaxies .    in fig .",
    "[ 2 mb ] we plot the nuclear stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath22 ) and the nuclear linewidth ( fwhm ) of [ nii]@xmath06583 , indicating the velocity dispersion of the interstellar gas , as a function of the total blue absolute magnitude for the sample of elliptical and s0 galaxies observed by phillips et al .",
    "( 1986 ) ( redshifts , apparent magnitudes and velocity dispersions are taken from ned and leda databases ) .",
    "as one can see , the increase of the central velocity dispersion of the gas with m(b ) is similar to that observed for the stars , though with a larger dispersion and a notable systematic shift .",
    "the mean ratio of fwhm([nii ] ) to @xmath22 is 2.08@xmath230.14 ( s.e.m . ) . in fig .",
    "[ 2 mb ] the polar - ring galaxies eso  503-g17 , ngc  5122 , eso  232-g4 ( present paper ) , ic  1689 @xcite , ugc  4323 , and ngc  4753 @xcite are located in the same region as normal early - type galaxies .",
    "the peculiar spiral galaxy eso  576-g69 ( c-46 ) is the most interesting object in our sample . as shown by carilli & van gorkom ( 1992 ) , an asymmetric ring - like structure surrounding the galaxy along the minor axis ( probably a polar ring )",
    "rotates around the major axis of eso  576-g69 with v@xmath24100 km @xmath25 .",
    "our kinematical observations show that the main body of the galaxy , on the other hand , rotates around the minor axis",
    ". therefore , eso  576-g69 can be classified as a _ kinematically - confirmed spiral polar - ring galaxy_. this kind of extragalactic objects is extremely rare ( e.g. ugc  4385  reshetnikov & combes 1994 , ngc  660  van driel et al .",
    "our results provide new data on nuclear properties of prgs .",
    "a first look at table  [ charsum ] shows that active nuclei are overpresented in the sample , where they represent @xmath2660 per cent ( 5/8 ) .",
    "because of the small sample size , this conclusion is not statistically significant .",
    "however , considering all 16 objects from reshetnikov & combes as well as the data on ngc  2685 @xcite , ngc  660 @xcite , and ic  1689 @xcite , the sample of prgs and candidates with nuclear spectra increases to 27 galaxies .",
    "of these at least 14 ( 52 per cent ) have liner or seyfert nuclei .",
    "considered separately , and according to the original papers , seyfert nuclei are found in 36 objects ( the first number refers to confident classifications and the second one includes uncertain classifications ) or 12.525 per cent , respectively , and liners in a total of 811 objects ( counted as above ) or 3341 per cent .",
    "therefore , the fraction of active nuclei is high among prgs and candidates .",
    "prgs hosting agns are predominantly s0 galaxies .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the number of s0@xmath27 and s0@xmath28 to the number of ordinary s0 .",
    "this requires good morphological classifications of our prgs and candidates , but such comparison is presently impossible since the available data is neither good nor abundant enough for the classification .",
    "moreover , most prg candidates are very peculiar and faint .",
    "more detailed and precise statistics can only be done when we have a sample of prgs at least twice as large as presently available together with good optical images .",
    "prgs are very heterogeneous objects regarding both morphology and environment .",
    "however , they have one particular feature in common : the existence of two large - scale strongly inclined kinematic subsystems . such complicated internal kinematics are considered usually as a consequence of relatively long - lasting galaxy interactions , accompanied by mass transfer from one galaxy to another ( ranging from gas accretion to complete merging ) .",
    "one can speculate that such interactions are favourable for the formation of non - thermal nuclear activity . due to the limited size of our sample this conclusion",
    "must , however , remain tentative for the time being .",
    "we have used the lyon - meudon extragalactic database ( leda ) supplied by the leda team at the cral - observatoire de lyon ( france ) and the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysical data system abstract service ( ads ) , and of the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , which was produced at the space telescope institute under u.s .",
