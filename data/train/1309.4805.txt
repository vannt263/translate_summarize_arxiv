    "the lattice - dynamical behavior ( `` the jiggling and wiggling of atoms '' , as feynman poetically said @xcite ) determines many of the physical properties of solids : infrared , raman , and neutron - diffraction spectra ; specific heats , thermal expansion , and heat conduction ; phenomena related to the electron - phonon interaction such as the resistivity of metals , superconductivity , and the temperature dependence of optical spectra ... it is thus essential to be able to model accurately the lattice dynamics of materials to understand and predict many of their properties .    in the last three decades , theoretical condensed - matter physics and computational materials science",
    "have made considerable progress .",
    "nowadays , many materials properties can be computed using _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical techniques .",
    "their only input information is the chemical composition and crystal structure of the material .",
    "the predictive power of _ ab initio _ computations has even started to be used to make materials design and predictions .",
    "@xcite in the specific case of lattice - dynamical properties , a large number of _ ab initio _ calculations based on the linear - response theory of lattice vibrations have been made possible over the past twenty years by the achievements of density - functional theory  @xcite ( dft ) and by the development of density - functional perturbation theory  @xcite ( dfpt ) .",
    "thanks to these theoretical and algorithmic advances , it is nowadays possible to obtain phonon dispersions on a fine grid of wave vectors covering the entire brillouin zone , which can directly be compared with neutron - diffraction data . from the phonon frequencies , many of the above physical properties can be computed .    within the framework of dft",
    ", the many - body problem of interacting electrons in a static external potential is cast into a tractable problem of non - interacting electrons moving in an effective potential .",
    "the latter includes the external potential and the effects of the coulomb interactions between the electrons , i.e. the so - called hartree term , describing the electron - electron repulsion , and the exchange and correlation ( xc ) interactions , which includes all the many - body interactions . modeling the xc interactions",
    "is the main difficulty of dft .",
    "the simplest approximation is the local - density approximation  @xcite ( lda ) , which is based upon exact exchange energy for a uniform electron gas and only requires the density at each point in space .",
    "a slightly more elaborate approach consists in using both the density and its gradient at each point in space in the so - called generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the most commonly used gga functional is the one proposed by perdew , burke , and ernzherhof ( pbe ) .",
    "@xcite it almost always overestimates the lattice constants of solids , while lda consistently underestimates the volume . in both cases , the typical errors amount to 1 - 2% of the lattice parameters .",
    "a series of alternative gga functionals have recently been proposed to overcome this problem , as well as to obtain accurate surface energies for solids .",
    "one such functional is the am05 functional ,  @xcite which combines the lda functional for bulk - like regions with a local airy approximation  @xcite for surface - like regions .",
    "in contrast , the pbesol  @xcite and wu and cohen ( wc )  @xcite functionals can be seen as revised versions of pbe specifically adapted for solids .",
    "these three functional ( am05 , pbesol , and wc ) yield indeed lattice constants that are in excellent agreement with experiments .",
    "@xcite more recently , the htbs functional  @xcite has been proposed as an efficient compromise leading to good results on challenging problems requiring accuracy for both solids and molecules ( e.g. , the co adsorption on noble metals surfaces ) .",
    "it is obtained by mixing two functionals : one performing well for atomization energies of molecules ( the rpbe  @xcite functional ) and one achieving very good accuracy for lattice constants in solids ( wc ) .",
    "these alternative functionals , which mainly focus on improving the modeling of the lattice constants , bond lengths and surface energies of solids , often compromise the accuracy for bulk total energies .",
    "it is therefore of interest to study how they perform when it comes to predicting properties governed by lattice dynamics ( such as phonon frequencies , dielectric constants , and thermal properties ) and that should be affected by both the accuracy in structural parameters and energy .",
    "it should be mentioned that the performance of pbe has already been tested for the phonon frequencies of a few selected solids .",
    "@xcite a comparison of lda , pbe , and an ad - hoc functional ( mixing 50% of the previous ones ) has been proposed for copper focusing on the theoretical debye - waller factors .",
    "@xcite more recently , the phonon dispersions of face - centered cubic metals ( cu , ag , au , ni , pd , pt , rh , and ir ) have also been investigated using the wc and pbesol functionals .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we consider five gga functionals ( pbe , pbesol , wc , am05 , and htbs ) as well as the lda to compute such properties using dfpt . we investigate a wide variety of materials including a semiconductor ( silicon ) , a metal ( copper ) , and various insulators ( sio@xmath0 @xmath1-quartz and stishovite , zrsio@xmath2 zircon , and mgo periclase ) .",
    "this allows us to assess the validity of the different xc functionals not only for structural properties ( as commonly reported in the literature ) but also for vibrational , thermodynamical , and dielectric properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : techn ] is devoted to the technical details of our calculations .",
    "our main results are then presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : reslt ] : we present successively ( [ sec : struc ] ) the structural properties , ( [ sec : phfrq ] ) the phonon frequencies at @xmath3 , ( [ sec : phbst ] ) the phonon dispersion curves , ( [ sec : phfrqvol ] ) the volume dependence of the phonon frequencies , ( [ sec : therm ] ) the thermodynamical properties , and ( [ sec : dielc ] ) the dielectric properties . based on these results , a few general statements and considerations",

    "the only exception is @xmath1-quartz for which the values obtained with the different ggas are much closer to the experimental values and tend to slightly underestimate it ( note that htbs results actually refer to @xmath42-quartz ) .",
    "in fact , the overestimation of the electronic dielectric constant can be related to the band - gap problem of dft . and ,",
    "since the different xc functionals used here have not been designed to produce a correct band gap , there is not a significant difference among the different results .",
    "the contributions of each individual mode @xmath122 depend on the volume ( @xmath123 ) , the oscillator strength ( @xmath124 ) and the frequency of the ir - active mode ( @xmath125 ) . as a result",
    ", the effects of the different xc functionals are closely connected to previous discussions of the structural properties and the frequencies at the @xmath3 point .",
    "the largest differences ( in absolute values  @xcite ) from one functional to another obviously appear in the low frequency modes for which the contributions can be quite significant ( since @xmath125 ) . for such modes , the errors with respect to experiments",
    "can also be quite large .",
    "for instance , the error on @xmath110 for zircon is about 40% when using pbe .",
    "it is also the contribution for which there is the largest difference between xc functionals ( 42% from lda which is very close the experimental value to pbe ) .",
    "the difference in @xmath122 is the combination of the differences in each of its components ( @xmath98 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 ) . in this case ,",
    "the most important differences originate from oscillator strength @xmath126 ( 22% ) and @xmath127 ( 12% , which also leads to 22% discrepancy when taken to the square ) .",
    "these are slightly compensated by the difference in @xmath98 ( 2% ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the differences in the oscillator strength are due essentially to differences in the atomic displacements ( related to the second derivatives of the total energy with respect to atomic displacements , just like the frequencies ) .",
    "indeed , we found that the xc functional has a very little impact ( at most 1 - 2% ) on the born effective charges ( connected to the mixed second - order derivative of the energy with respect to atomic displacements and macroscopic electric field ) . and ,",
    "since our results are in excellent agreement with previous calculations , the born effective charges are not reported here for sake of brevity .",
    "however , we would like to point out that it is known that dft tends to overestimate the born effective charges .",
    "@xcite and , as a result , part of the discrepancy of @xmath122 with respect to experiments can be explained by the too large oscillator strengths .    finally , we turn to the static dielectric constant @xmath101 .",
    "the theoretical values are larger than the experimental ones by about 8 - 14% .",
    "this is directly related to previous discussion about @xmath100 and @xmath122 .",
    "the best results are obtained within lda , while pbe and htbs lead to the worst results .",
    "the other three functionals ( pbesol , am05 , and wc ) have a similar accuracy which is slightly worse than for lda .",
    "in view of our results on different functionals , materials and dfpt properties , a few general statements and considerations can be made . for all oxides and semiconductors",
    ", lda performs surprisingly well in most of the cases . as the lda lattice parameter",
    "is strongly underestimated and the lattice parameter has a large role in determining the frequencies ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : phfrqvol ] ) , the success of lda must be due to some cancellation of errors .",
    "accurate vibrational properties are obtained with a significantly underestimated lattice parameter .",
    "this implies that using the experimental lattice parameter with lda will degrade the quality of the dfpt results .",
    "interestingly , pbe does not benefit from a similar effect and , as a result , it is inaccurate in both the lattice parameters and the frequencies .",
    "similar conclusions were found when investigating the theoretical debye - waller factors  @xcite , leading the proposal of an ad - hoc functional obtained by mixing 50% of lda and 50% of pbe .",
    "the optimal functionals providing both accurate structural factors and reasonably accurate ( i.e. , at least better than pbe ) frequencies are the wc , pbesol and am05 . finally , htbs is not to be recommended for dfpt as both structural parameters and frequencies are not accurate .    if one uses a functional such as pbesol or wc ( that give very good structural parameters ) , phonon frequencies are usually accurate within maximum 5% , vibrational entropies within maximum 6% , and static dielectric constants overestimate experiments systematically by at most 10% .",
    "these results show that while there are differences between functionals , dfpt computations are accurate enough to lead to a reasonable predictive power .",
    "on the other hand , the only metal in our data set ( copper ) shows a very different behavior with the best functional being pbe and the worst being lda , pbesol , wc and am05 . in view of previous work on metal phonon frequencies  @xcite and debye - waller factors  @xcite with dfpt",
    "this discrepancy might originate from the pseudopotential .",
    "in this paper , the validity of various exchange - correlation functionals ( lda , pbe , pbesol , wc , am05 , and htbs ) has been investigated for computing the structural , vibrational , dielectric , and thermodynamical properties of various materials ( silicon , sio@xmath0 @xmath1-quartz and stishovite , zrsio@xmath2 zircon , mgo periclase , and copper ) in the framework of dfpt . for the structural properties , pbesol and wc are found to provide the results closest to the experiments and am05 performs only slightly worse .",
    "these three functionals constitute an improvement over lda and pbe in contrast with htbs which has been shown to be really problematic for @xmath1-quartz .    for the vibrational and thermodynamical properties , lda performs surprisingly very well .",
    "in the majority of cases , it outperforms pbe significantly and yields slightly better results than the wc , pbesol , and am05 functionals . for the latter functionals ,",
    "this slight improvement is however detrimental for the structural parameters . on the other hand , htbs performs also poorly for vibrational quantities .    for the dielectric properties , all the functionals fail to reproduce the electronic dielectric constant due to the well - known band gap problem .",
    "they all tend to overestimate the oscillator strengths and hence the static dielectric constant .",
    "overall , lda provides very good performances in dfpt computations provided the lda lattice parameter is used .",
    "if accurate lattice parameters are also sought for , the pbesol , wc and am05 provide the most accurate structural results while still improving in terms of vibrational quantities compared to pbe .",
