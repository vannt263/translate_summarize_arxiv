    "the discovery of superconductivity in pnictide compounds containing iron came as an enormous surprise to the condensed matter physics and materials chemistry community .",
    "this started with derivatives of lafepo ( @xmath13  k )  @xcite , and then , attracting far greater attention , lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 ( @xmath14  k )  @xcite .",
    "the _ ln_feaso@xmath0f@xmath1 ( 1111 ) materials have provided a remarkable range of superconducting materials with @xmath12 rising quickly to @xmath15  k in smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1  @xcite , and subsequently @xmath16  k in that compound and oxygen deficient smfeaso@xmath17  @xcite .",
    "double layered feas - based ( 122 ) materials with the general formula @xmath18fe@xmath19as@xmath20 ( @xmath21  k )  @xcite and the single layered ( 111 ) and stoichiometric lifeas ( @xmath22k )  @xcite and nafeas ( @xmath23  k )  @xcite also superconduct . these new materials can be considered analogous to the cuprate high-@xmath12 superconductors but based on anti - pbo - type feas layers rather than planar cuo@xmath20 layers and with more than one band relevant to the superconductivity .",
    "the superconducting properties and novel magnetism in these compounds have been a great spur to recent research .",
    "the tantalising prospect is that the analogy will offer insights that will identify common aspects of the superconducting mechanism in both types of material .",
    "specific heat measurements are a powerful probe of magnetism and superconductivity since they probe the entropy involved with the electronic phase transitions , and provide a straightforward comparison with theoretical work . in the pnictide superconductors",
    "both fe magnetism and superconductivity , and the magnetic behaviour of the rare - earth moments are amenable to investigation using this technique .",
    "in this paper we present heat capacity results on three smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 samples in the doping range where the coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity has been suggested , undoped smfeaso and ndfeaso where magnetism is present without superconductivity , and superconducting samples of lafeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 and lifeas where there is no magnetic order . following a review of previous work ( section  2 ) and a description of the technique ( section  3 ) , we present our results .",
    "these are divided into the @xmath24he heat capacity results on the oxypnictide compounds in section  [ sec : he4 ] and the @xmath4he heat capacity results on the same materials in section  [ sec : he3 ] .",
    "the results on lifeas are presented in section  [ sec : lfa ] .",
    "we describe the experimental methodology in section  [ sec : exp ] and discuss the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "a significant number of specific heat measurements have already been carried out on pnictide compounds although they have covered only a small selection of the compounds synthesized so far .",
    "smfeaso@xmath0o@xmath2 has already been studied at the dopings @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29  @xcite , away from the intermediate doping range we consider here , revealing a peak in the specific heat in the undoped sample at @xmath30  k and @xmath31 anomalies near @xmath32  k. in lafeas(o , f )  @xcite the structural ( @xmath33  k ) and magnetic transitions ( @xmath34  k ) are clearly resolved and have a small combined entropy of @xmath35  r  @xcite . the sommerfeld coefficient was found to be relatively small , @xmath36  mjmol@xmath37k@xmath38  @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature values of @xmath11 were found to vary in applied magnetic field as @xmath39 , suggestive of line nodes in the superconducting gap function  @xcite . in this issue",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite examine the structural and magnetic transitions around @xmath40  k in cefeaso , prfeaso , and ndfeaso , finding clear separation between them and distinct heat capacity anomalies at each transition .",
    "lafepo has also been studied in detail  @xcite , @xmath41  mjmol@xmath37k@xmath38 and relatively small specific heat jumps have been measured at @xmath12 , @xmath42",
    ".    a smaller number of 122 materials have also been measured : bani@xmath19as@xmath19 has a first - order phase transition at @xmath43  k and a sommerfeld coefficient @xmath44  mjmol@xmath37k@xmath38 .",
    "a superconducting sample with @xmath45  k shows a very well defined specific heat jump at @xmath12 , with @xmath46 .",
    "this is good evidence for bulk superconductivity , but further analysis was not pursued  @xcite .",
    "a more recent study of a ba@xmath47k@xmath48fe@xmath19as@xmath19 single crystal  @xcite found a @xmath49  k wide specific heat peak at @xmath50  k and probed the field dependence of the feature .",
    "evidence for strong coupling was found and the @xmath51 values were over @xmath52 .",
    "there have been relatively few predictions made concerning the heat capacity of the pnictide superconductors , but one is particularly relevant to our work here  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 has a nematic electronic phase overlapping the superconducting phase , probably in the doping range considered here .",
    "the low - temperature specific heat would change from @xmath53 in the superconducting phase to @xmath54 in the nematic phase , with a crossover to the conventional @xmath55 scalings @xmath56 close enough to the nematic critical point .",
    "the smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath2 samples were synthesized by conventional solid state reaction methods , as described in refs  @xcite .",
    "standard powder x - ray diffraction patterns were measured where all peaks could be indexed to the tetragonal zrcusias - type structure .",
    "dc resistivity and magnetisation measurements were made to determine the midpoint ( 10  % to 90  % width ) of the resistive and diamagnetic transitions with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59  k for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "these samples have previously been investigated using @xmath63sr  @xcite , which suggested the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "lafeaso@xmath64f@xmath65 ( @xmath66  k ) was synthesised by a method adapted from ref .",
    "@xcite ; a mixture of la , la@xmath19o@xmath67 , laf@xmath68 , f and as was heated at @xmath69  c for 12  hrs in an evacuated silica ampoule then thoroughly re - ground , pelletised and heated to @xmath70  c for a further 48hrs in evacuated silica .",
    "the resulting material was examined by laboratory powder x - ray diffraction and found to contain lafeaso@xmath64f@xmath65 ( @xmath66  k ) as the majority phase with small amounts of feas ( @xmath71mol  % ) and laof ( @xmath72mol  % ) . the lifeas sample used in our experiments",
    "was synthesized by the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite and corresponds to sample 2 described in that study , with @xmath73  k. while the diamagnetic shift in this sample is far smaller than ideal , or that of the @xmath74  k sample  @xcite , @xmath63sr measurements on this sample demonstrated that the superconducting sample volume was @xmath75  %  @xcite , suggesting that particle size effects may be affecting the bulk dc susceptibility measurement .",
    "the heat capacity measurements were carried out using a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) over the temperature range @xmath76 to @xmath77  k , with measurements below @xmath78  k carried out using the standard @xmath4he insert .",
    "samples were in the form of pressed powder pellets and were affixed to the measurement stage using apiezon n - grease .",
    "the measurement technique employed by the ppms is the two - tau relaxation method  @xcite where the temperature of the sample is measured while a heat pulse is applied and for an equal time afterwards while the sample cools .",
    "the time dependence of the temperature variation in each part of the measurement is described by the sum of two exponentials describing the heat capacity of the sample and the measurement stage , and the coupling between them .",
    "the effectiveness of this technique is discussed critically by lashley  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and we can expect the absolute heat capacity values to be correct to within @xmath79  % for @xmath80  k and @xmath81  % for @xmath82  k. these errors are comparable with the error in the sample mass .",
    "the data for the oxypnictide materials smfeaso@xmath64f@xmath65 , smfeaso@xmath83f@xmath84 , smfeaso@xmath85f@xmath86 , and lafeaso@xmath64f@xmath65 from @xmath78 to @xmath87  k are shown in figure  [ he4hc ] .",
    "the lattice and electronic parts of the heat capacity data are fitted to the equation : @xmath88 where @xmath11 is the sommerfeld coefficient , and @xmath89 and @xmath90 are debye and einstein functions respectively .",
    "we found that the data were well described by including only one einstein mode , giving a more simple fitting function than was used by tropeano _",
    "et al . _",
    "the total amplitude of the lattice modes is almost exactly value expected from the dulong - petit law .",
    "fits were carried out over the temperature range @xmath91  k as apiezon n grease produces small heat capacity anomalies above @xmath87  k. the parameters derived from fitting equation  [ eq : hcfit ] to the data shown in figure  [ he4hc ] are shown in table  [ latticetable ] . as is apparent from figure  [ he4hc ] ,",
    "the lattice contributions are almost identical for the four samples , and the main differences are the change in the electronic term @xmath11 going from the la compound to the sm compounds , and the @xmath31 anomalies at @xmath92 ( hereafter @xmath5 ) in each of the sm samples .",
    "the difference between the @xmath11 values of the sm and la compounds , @xmath93 vs.  @xmath94  mjmol@xmath37k@xmath38 , is quite remarkable .",
    "our values of @xmath11 are comparable with those reported by ding _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for samples with slightly different dopings .",
    "similarly high values of @xmath11 have been observed in nd ( as we show in section  [ sec : he3 ] below ) and ce oxypnictides .",
    "raw heat capacity data on @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "the fits are described in the text and use the parameters shown in table  [ latticetable ] . ]",
    ".[latticetable ] lattice heat capacity fitting parameters derived from fitting equation  [ eq : hcfit ] to the raw heat capacity data for the smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath2 and @xmath98 samples described in section  [ sec : he4 ] .",
    "the quoted errors are @xmath99 from the fitting . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have studied a series of sm , nd , and la - containing oxypnictides and investigated the effect that the rare - earth magnetic moments have on the magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "the @xmath31 anomalies at each nel temperature give clear evidence for ordering of the rare - earth moments , confirming previous studies .",
    "we have extended those studies by investigating the form of the heat capacity in the sm samples below 2  k , which provides evidence for a new feature occurring slightly below 2  k that grows with increasing doping .",
    "this provides a natural explanation for the previously observed drop in the size of the peak at @xmath32  k with increasing doping .",
    "we also probed the crystal field levels of the sm@xmath7 ions in smfeaso@xmath64f@xmath65 and found they were consistent with both the @xmath100 entropy associated with magnetic ordering at low - temperature and also the free spin @xmath101 value observed at high temperature .",
    "the energies of the levels appear to be similar to those found in superconducting @xmath102 using inelastic neutron scattering . in lafeaso@xmath64f@xmath65 and @xmath103",
    "we see distinct anomalies due to the superconducting transitions , whereas in the smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 samples magnetic contributions complicate the form of the data and the superconducting contribution is less distinct .",
    "there remain many avenues to be explored using heat capacity in this fast moving field , including the possibility of nematic electronic order when superconductivity has been suppressed in smfeaso@xmath0f@xmath1 and the trends of crystal field levels as the rare - earth ions are substituted and the oxygen doping is changed ; but it is already clear that this fundemental thermodynamic technique , coupled with careful analysis , can provide much useful information on the properties of feas - based compounds .      * * kamihara y _",
