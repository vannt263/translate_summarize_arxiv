    "how do non - abelian plasmas that start far from equilibrium , such as quark - gluon plasmas produced in heavy ion collisions , equilibrate ?",

    "a pathbreaking first attempt was made by baier , mueller , schiff , and son @xcite , who analyzed equilibration in the weak coupling limit via scattering processes of individual particles .",
    "the resulting picture of quark - gluon plasma equilibration is known as the bottom - up scenario .",
    "it was later realized , however , that collective effects in the form of magnetic plasma instabilities , known as weibel or filamentary instabilities , necessarily play a role in bottom - up equilibration @xcite .",
    "these instabilities have long been known in traditional plasma physics @xcite , but their non - abelian counterparts develop somewhat differently .",
    "the effect of non - abelian interactions on the late - time development of plasma instabilities has been studied over the past few years with numerical simulations @xcite",
    ". a great deal has been learned , but these simulations have not significantly explored the extremely non - equilibrium conditions relevant to the initial phase of bottom - up thermalization .    in particular , weibel instabilities are generated by anisotropic distributions of plasma particle momenta , as measured in local plasma rest frames .",
    "so far , simulations have mostly focused on the case of moderate anisotropy .",
    "the bottom - up scenario , however , generates parametrically extreme anisotropies early on , before thermalization is achieved .",
    "thermalization , of course , eventually produces isotropic ( thermal ) momentum distributions in local plasma rest frames . as an example , in the original bottom - up scenario ( ignoring plasma instabilities ) , at one particular pre - thermalization moment of the expansion , the local distribution of particle velocities looks like a pancake in momentum space , with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the qcd coupling constant and @xmath3 is the beam direction .",

    "these initial gluons are the `` hard '' particles in discussions of thermalization .",
    "we formally consider the case where @xmath7 is so large that the running coupling @xmath8 can be treated as arbitrarily small .",

    "the one - dimensional expansion effectively red - shifts the component @xmath11 of hard particle momenta along the beam axis , as measured in local plasma rest frames . for free particles ,",
    "the expansion would drive the system away from local anisotropy as @xmath12 however , small - angle @xmath13 collisions between the hard particles tend to broaden @xmath14 , softening the anisotropy to @xmath15 in the original bottom - up analysis of baier _ et al .",
