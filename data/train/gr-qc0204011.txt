    "@xcite has suggested a new method to tackle the dynamics and gw emission from the last orbits of binary black holes .",

    "the main philosophy of @xcite was to push analytical methods to their limits so as to use numerical methods only to describe the plunge , which was estimated ( when the masses are comparable ) to last about 60% of one orbit . to implement this philosophy",
    ", one needs to be able to construct _ numerical _ initial data that match the _ dynamical _ initial data given by the method of @xcite at the start of the plunge .",
    "this is a non trivial task because , up to very recently , there was a significant discrepancy between analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite estimates of the dynamical characteristics of the orbits near the lso .",
    "for instance , the binding energy at the lso , @xmath3 , is analytically estimated to be around @xmath4% @xcite ( third post - newtonian effective - one - body estimate with @xmath5 @xcite ) , while two different numerical estimates @xcite gave @xmath6% , i.e. a significantly more bound ( by 38% ) lso .",
    "the discrepancy is even more striking if one considers the lso orbital period : the analytical estimate is @xmath7 @xcite , which is twice longer than the numerical one @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "[ by contrast , the dispersion among analytical estimates @xcite , as well as the dispersion among numerical ones @xcite is significantly smaller than the difference between analytical and numerical results .",
    "see @xcite for a review of analytical methods , and see below for a brief discussion of our choice of analytical estimates .",
    "] this discrepancy diminishes the physical relevance of a recent attempt @xcite at fulfilling the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. to start a full numerical calculation of the plunge just after the crossing of the lso .",
    "very recently , a new numerical approach to the circular orbits of binary black holes has been set up @xcite and implemented @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion and an extension to any black hole rotation state ) .",
    "contrary to the previous numerical approaches @xcite , which were formulated in terms of the initial value problem of general relativity and dealt therefore only with the four constraint equations on a 3-dimensional spacelike hypersurface , the new approach @xcite deals with a full 4-dimensional spacetime ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the link with york s conformal thin - sandwich formalism @xcite ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that this spacetime is endowed with a helical killing vector @xcite , which amounts to neglecting the gravitational radiation reaction , i.e. to considering that the orbits are exactly circular .",
    "in addition , refs .",

    "the spacetime manifold is chosen to have the topology of the real line times the two - sheeted misner - lindquist manifold .",
    "the two sheets are assumed to be isometric ( with respect to the full 4-metric ) . under the above assumptions ,",
    "the problem amounts to solving five of the ten einstein equations .",
    "this is one more that the previous numerical approaches @xcite .",
    "hereafter we call the new method @xcite the _ helical killing vector ( hkv ) _ approach , and previous methods @xcite _ ivp _ ones ( for _ initial value problem _ ) . note that the hkv approach has also been employed for binary neutron stars ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the first numerical results obtained by the hkv method @xcite for the characteristics of the lso indicate a much better agreement with analytical estimates than those obtained with the ivp method @xcite . however , the comparison , done in @xcite , used analytical results valid only for _ non spinning _ black holes , while the numerical approach of @xcite concerns _ corotating _ binary black holes .",
    "moreover , the comparison made in @xcite was limited to the sole lso , without looking at the behavior of the other circular orbits .",
    "it is known that the presence of even small additional interactions ( especially repulsive ones ) can have an important effect on the dynamical characteristics of the orbits around the lso .",
    "it is therefore a priori necessary to include spin - orbit effects ( which are repulsive in the corotating case ) when doing the analytical / numerical comparison .",
    "fortunately , a recent analytical work @xcite has shown how to generalize the effective one body ( eob ) approach of @xcite by including , to lowest order , spin - orbit and spin - spin effects .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to take into account in detail the effect of the spin interactions in corotating binary black holes .",
    "another important feature of this work is that we shall compare the predictions of the eob method @xcite and the results of the new numerical approach of @xcite , not only for the characteristics of the lso ( to which most authors limit their considerations ) , but also for all other circular orbits .",
    "we shall do that by comparing several physically important ( and coordinate - invariant ) functions , such as the binding energy as a function of angular velocity . note",
    "that , in this work , we loosely call `` lso '' , for a corotating system , the _ maximal binding _ configuration along a corotating sequence . for hkv sequences , it has been shown that this minimal energy configuration marks the onset of an orbital instability @xcite .",
    "the fact that such corotating sequences are ( probably ) not realized in actual coalescing systems , and that the corotating `` lso '' signals only a secular instability , is not important for the present work whose main aim is to show how one can relate the numerical and analytical descriptions of the same configuration involving spinning black holes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii discusses the arguments selecting the eob method as the current best analytical method for tackling the last orbits of binary black holes and summarizes the eob approach to spinning black holes .",
    "section iii applies the eob formalism to corotating black holes on circular orbits and shows how to compare the analytical results to the recent numerical computation of a sequence of corotating binary black holes .",
    "section iv discusses the meaning of our results .",
    "before summarizing the effective one - body ( eob ) formalism , let us recall why we consider it as the best current analytical formalism for tackling the dynamics of the last orbits of binary black holes .",
    "the first point is that the second work in ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that it is crucial , if one wishes to keep a good overlap with the expected real signals , to generate gw templates which go beyond the `` adiabatic approximation '' and which use accurate equations of motion , including radiation reaction , to describe the smooth transition ( taking place around the lso ) between inspiral motion and plunge . however , the most accurate equations of motion @xcite are a priori given as very complicated expressions , containing hundreds of terms . these equations of motion are essentially power series in a formal `` small parameter '' @xmath10 [ `` post - newtonian '' ( pn ) expansion ] .",
    "the problem is that the `` small '' pn expansion parameter @xmath11 is not numerically very small near the lso .",
    "it was found quite early that the use of straightforward pn - expanded equations of motion ( as in @xcite ) is unsatisfactory because the pn - expanded equations of motion converge so slowly that , at low orders , they can lead to a behavior which is qualitatively different from what one expects . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that the pn - expanded ( harmonic - coordinates ) equations of motion admit an lso at the second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) level , but admit no lso at both the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) and the _ third post - newtonian _ ( 3pn ) levels .",
    "[ `` lso '' is taken here in the sense of a critical point in the dynamical analysis of circular orbits .",
    "] by contrast , a study of the lso in terms of the pn - expanded hamiltonian @xcite has found that the pn - expanded hamiltonian ( in various coordinates ) admits no lso at the 2pn level , but admit lso s at the 1pn and 3pn levels .",
    "this unstable behavior is a sign of the unreliability of non - resummed pn approaches .",
    "as the recent work @xcite has succeeded in deriving complete 3pn equations of motion , it would be unacceptable to `` spoil '' the precious information they contain by using them in such an inappropriate way .",
    "this led ref .",
    "@xcite to propose to improve the situation by using a _ partial resummation _ approach .",
    "specifically , they introduced an `` hybrid '' approach in which one resums exactly the `` schwarzschild '' terms in the ( relative ) equations of motion , while continuing to treat the @xmath12-dependent terms ( where @xmath13 ) as straightforward pn expansions .",
    "this `` hybrid '' approach did improve the situation to some extent ( at least at the 2pn accuracy ) .",
    "however , later work showed that the hybrid approach was neither robust , nor consistent .",
    "@xcite showed that the predictions of the hybrid approach were robust neither under using hamiltonian equations of motion instead of newtonian - like ones , nor under a change of coordinate system .",
    "@xcite pointed out the inconsistency of the hybrid method by showing that the formal ( un - resummed ) `` @xmath12-corrections '' represent , in several cases , a very large ( larger than 100% ) modification of the corresponding resummed @xmath12-independent terms .",
    "this led to a quest for new resummation approaches providing full dynamical equations of motion for binary systems , and being robust and consistent .",
    "the only such method we are aware of is the eob approach @xcite .",
    "we do not consider here methods such as the @xmath14- or @xmath15-methods of @xcite and the @xmath16-method of @xcite which were devised to investigate the location of the lso .",
    "these methods can not be used beyond the `` adiabatic approximation '' because they do not provide full dynamical equations of motion able to model the transition between inspiral and plunge .",
    "let us note in this respect that the work of @xcite has shown that , in the case of comparable masses , the transition between inspiral and plunge is a gradual process in which the precise location of the `` adiabatic '' lso is less important than a precise evaluation of radiation damping effects .",
    "therefore it is finally not very important to focus on the `` exact '' location of the lso .",
    "what is really important is to have a good description of the dynamics of the last ten orbits before the plunge .",
    "moreover , even if we were to consider only the determination of the lso , the comparisons made in @xcite have shown that the eob method is the most robust in that it is the least sensitive to changes in the 3pn coefficients ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "we also note in passing that @xcite had shown that the @xmath15-method was more robust ( both in its dependence on @xmath12 and under changes in higher pn coefficients ) , and more convergent , than the straightforward non resummed @xmath14-method ( recently used at 3pn in @xcite ) ; see table i , table vii and fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "the robustness of the eob method is discussed in refs .",
    "we shall give below further examples of the robustness of the eob approach .",
    "the basic idea of the eob method is to map the ( complicated ) relative dynamics ( in the center of mass ) of a two - body system onto the ( drastically simpler ) dynamics of an `` effective '' one - body system .",
    "most of the ( physically irrelevant ) gauge - related complications of the two - body equations of motion get absorbed into the mapping between the two problems .",
    "the mapping is defined so as to preserve the adiabatic invariants ( which , at the quantum level , are quantized in units of @xmath17 ) .",
    "the energy mapping @xmath18 between the real two - body ( center of mass ) energy @xmath19 and the effective one - body energy @xmath20 is determined by the matching between the two problems .",
    "it is remarkably found that the energy map @xmath21 is extremely simple , and independent of the pn accuracy considered ( we set @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the masses of the two bodies , while @xmath26 denotes the reduced mass @xmath27 , with @xmath28 denoting the total mass .",
    "let us note also the definition of the symmetric mass ratio @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the inverse of the energy map ( [ eq2.1 ] ) is @xmath31 the effective energy @xmath20 is given by the effective hamiltonian @xmath32 . here ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 are the positions and momenta of the effective one - body ( describing the relative motion ) and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the two independent spin vectors of the two bodies .",
    "@xcite considered only the 2pn approximation and the spin - independent case .",
    "the 3pn , spin - independent effective hamiltonian was determined in @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently showed how to add the spin interactions in the eob framework .",
    "the most complete version of the 3pn spin - dependent effective hamiltonian is given by eq .",
    "( 2.56 ) of @xcite . for simplicity , and because spin - spin effects will turn out to be quite small , we shall consider the less complete , but simpler , effective hamiltonian defined by eq .",
    "( 2.26 ) of @xcite with the effective metric defined by the `` deformed kerr metric '' of section iic there .",
    "this hamiltonian takes into account ( at the lowest pn approximation ) the full spin - orbit interaction , and incorporates most of the spin - spin interaction .",
    "[ in the case of parallel spins the ratio between the spin - spin interaction included in the simplified @xmath37 and the more complete one @xmath38 is @xmath39 . ]",
    "the kerr parameter of the effective kerr metric describing spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the eob approach can deal with the most general case where the spin vectors @xmath35 , @xmath36 are arbitrarily oriented .",
    "in fact , one of the great advantages of the eob approach is that , being hamiltonian - based , it provides a full set of evolution equations for all the dynamical variables : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "see eqs .",
    "( 3.1)(3.4 ) of @xcite .",

    "[ we use the fact that the carter - like constant @xmath48 vanishes for the `` equatorial '' orbits that we are considering .",

    "let us also introduce the following dimensionless variables ( note that @xmath53 for the orbits we consider and that , by definition , @xmath54 ) @xmath55 and @xmath56 the quantity @xmath57 entering these equations is the modulus of the effective kerr parameter defined by eq .",

    "a nice feature of the eob approach is that , in the spin - independent case , the dynamics of circular orbits is fully encoded in only one function : the function @xmath74 , with @xmath75 .",
    "[ as discussed in @xcite , the dynamics of non circular orbits involves two more functions : @xmath76 and @xmath77 . ] it is truly remarkable that the hundreds of complicated contributions entering the pn - expanded two - body equations of motion get drastically compactified in so few functions . in particular , for circular orbits , the essential physical information of the pn - expanded dynamics is contained in the effective metric coefficient @xmath78 note that there are no 1pn ( @xmath79 ) contribution in @xmath72 , and that the 2pn effects amount to the very simple term @xmath80 @xcite .",

    "let us emphasize the various senses in which the eob approach is a `` resummation '' of the original , fully pn - expanded equations of motion .",
    "a first , crucial `` resummation '' feature of the eob approach is the mapping of the original dynamical variables @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 onto the effective variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "this mapping @xcite is given as a complicated pn expansion , and provides a first level of simplification and compactification of the dynamics .",
    "a second feature consists in the fact that the real hamiltonian is given by an iterated square - root .",
    "for instance , in the spin - independent case ( @xmath94 ) @xmath95 this iterated square - root structure is , by itself , a partial resummation because the fully pn - expanded hamiltonian , which has the form @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 $ ] , would be obtained by re - expanding all this square - root structure in powers of @xmath99 and @xmath100 . finally , on top of these two partial resummations , it is very natural , within the eob approach , to further resum @xmath101 by replacing the pn - expanded results for @xmath72 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.9 ] ) , and/or @xmath102 , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.12 ] ) , by some better behaved expressions .",
    "indeed , as we recalled above , in the spin - independent case @xmath72 plays the basic role of replacing @xmath103 in the radial potential determining the circular orbits .",

    "we note that the prediction of the non - resummed @xmath14-method for the _ irrotational _ lso angular velocity is @xmath239% _ larger _ than the corresponding eob prediction .",
    "the fact that the @xmath14-method yields , at 3pn , significantly larger values of @xmath240 than the eob one , in the equal - mass case , is not surprising in view of the fact that it already did so in the `` test mass limit '' ( @xmath241 ) , i.e. when one mass is much smaller than the other one .",

    "for instance , we think that a plausible range for the correct maximal binding energy is @xmath254 , in the corotating case , and @xmath255 in the irrotational one .",

    "the numerical coefficient @xmath313 is about twice larger than the corresponding result obtained in @xcite .",
    "note that this coefficient is consistent with the small @xmath12 limit of the result written in eq.(4.1 ) of @xcite .",
    "the latter equation then shows that , in the equal - mass case ( of interest here ) , @xmath222 , i.e. @xmath314 , the numerical coefficient giving the so - induced change of @xmath315 is further enhanced ( by a factor 1.888 ) to the value @xmath316 . actually , the data in table  ii of @xcite show that the latter result is valid only for values of @xmath112 smaller than @xmath317 . for the value @xmath318 relevant to us ( see table  [ t : lso ] above ) , nonlinear effects in @xmath112 further enhance the change in binding energy .",
    "interpolating between the numerical data given in table  ii of @xcite one can see that a better estimate of @xmath15 for @xmath318 is @xmath319 .",
    "compared to the value without spin - orbit contribution , @xmath320 , this yields a so - related modification equal to @xmath321 .",
    "finally , we conclude that the eob approach gives ( at 3pn ) :",
    "( i ) an increase of @xmath322 due to the kinetic energy of the spinning black holes of order @xmath323 , and a decrease linked to spin - orbit effects ( as estimated within the eob framework ) of order @xmath324 .",
    "the net result is that @xmath322 increases only by @xmath325 .",
    "this analysis has clarified why and how the eob approach yields a rather small final effect for the difference between the irrotational case and the corotating one .",
    "we view this result as a confirmation of the generic robustness of the eob approach .",
    "by contrast , we view the significantly larger change predicted by non - resummed pn approaches as further confirmations of the generic lack of robustness of non - resummed pn methods .",
    "an interesting lesson of this comparison is that the larger so - related changes predicted by the eob approach are crucially linked to its _ non perturbative _ nature .",

    "the eob method provides such a complete description ( which allows it to describe not only the adiabatic inspiral but also the crucial transition to the plunge )",
    ". however , numerical methods do not give access to such a multi - variable function .",
    "as a makeshift we can at least compare various functions of one variable linked to the two - body dynamics . in fig .",
    "[ f : seq_e ] we plot various analytical and numerical estimates of the binding energy of circular orbits versus the orbital frequency , while fig .",
    "[ f : seq_j ] plots the total angular momentum @xmath327 .",
    "these figures show that the methods that led to good agreement for lso characteristics in fig .",
    "[ f : comp_lso ] , also lead to good agreement for all circular orbits , and all available dynamical quantities .",
    "we have also included in these figures the results coming out of the straightforward truncation of the @xmath328-function , eq .",
    "( [ eq2.12 ] ) .",
    "we see that it agrees rather well ( compared , say , with the conformal - imaging or puncture data ) with the helical killing vector ( hkv ) data nearly up to the lso .",
    "if we remember that ref .  @xcite has shown that , a little bit above the normal ( adiabatic ) lso , radiation damping effects dominate over the `` restoring '' radial potential , it is very plausible that even the pure taylor eob function @xmath134 would lead to a gw signal essentially indistinguishable from the one obtained from a pad - resummed function @xmath134 . note that figs .",
    "[ f : seq_e ] and [ f : seq_j ] confirm the messages of fig .",
    "[ f : comp_lso ] : the main feature is a nice agreement of all versions of eob and hkv results versus a significant difference with the conformal - imaging or puncture results .",
    "when looking at the finer structure of the eob predictions one sees that the 3pn predictions are much closer to the hkv data than the 2pn ones .    as we said above , the multi - parameter `` flexibility '' of the eob approach @xmath329",
    "can be exploited , to further improve , if deemed necessary , the agreement with numerical data .",
    "for instance , we have played with the addition of @xmath330 and found that , with the pad resummation ( [ eq2.17 ] ) , a value @xmath331 further improves the agreement with hkv data .",
    "however , we do not consider such a best fit value of @xmath330 as significant at this stage .",
    "another interesting `` robustness '' exercise consists in modifying the general relativistic ( gr ) prediction ( [ eq2.10 ] ) for the 3pn coefficient ( [ eq2.10 ] ) .",
    "we recall that , from the recent dimensional continuation calculation of @xcite , the gr value should be , when @xmath332 , @xmath333 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq2.11 ] ) ) . by varying @xmath249 ( without adding any further terms",
    "@xmath334 ) we found that a value which provides a slightly better fit is @xmath335 .",
    "the corresponding curves are plotted in figs .",
    "[ f : seq_e ] and [ f : seq_j ] .",
    "on the other hand , note that the value @xmath336 , corresponding to the 2pn approximation only , noticeably worsens the agreement with the hkv data . in all cases , the reader should notice that the binding energy differences linked to these different choices for the 3pn contribution @xmath249 remain small compared with the dispersion among all numerical results .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are the following . we have confirmed the robustness of the effective one - body ( eob ) approach to binary black hole dynamics .",
    "the various ways of resumming the crucial eob radial function @xmath134 exhibited in figs .",
    "[ f : a(u)-var ] and [ f : a(u)-pade ] lead to predictions for the binding energy and the angular momentum as functions of orbital frequency , which are very close to each other , see figs .",
    "[ f : comp_lso ] , [ f : seq_e ] and [ f : seq_j ] , and table  [ t : lso ] .",
    "even the `` non resummed '' function @xmath134 ( upper curve in fig .",
    "[ f : a(u)-var ] ) leads to dynamical predictions which are quantitatively close to the `` resummed '' predictions up to the last orbits before the last stable ( circular ) orbit ( lso ) ( see figs .  [",
    "f : seq_e ] and [ f : seq_j ] ) . we have argued that it would probably yield indistinguishable waveforms if used , as in @xcite , to study the transition between inspiral and plunge .",
    "[ however , if one wishes , as in @xcite , to continue the description of the plunge nearly down to coalescence we expect that a non resummed @xmath134 will quickly lead to problems and to strong deviations from the results obtained from various resummed @xmath134 . ]",
    "another robustness feature of the eob approach is its good post - newtonian ( pn ) convergence properties .",
    "this was illustrated in figs .",
    "[ f : comp_lso ] , [ f : seq_e ] and [ f : seq_j ] where the 1pn , 2pn and 3pn predictions are seen to be all much closer to the helical killing vector ( hkv ) data than to the other numerical data .",
    "note , however , that the best agreement with hkv data is obtained for the 3pn prediction .",
    "we emphasized also the consistency ( and robustness ) of the eob approach in the treatment of the changes induced by spin effects .",
    "this contrasts with non - resummed pn approaches which predict different changes when one uses different parameters to run along a corotating sequence .",
    "the most novel aspect of the present work is that we have shown how to apply to corotating sequences the recently defined @xcite extension of the eob approach to spinning black holes .",
    "the effects linked to the spins turn out , finally , to be rather small .",
    "for instance , they are significantly smaller than the effect of using the 3pn - accurate eob hamiltonian instead of a 2pn - accurate one , see fig .",
    "[ f : comp_lso ] .",
    "we discussed the reasons behind this behavior ( essentially a near cancellation between an energy increase linked to the spin kinetic energy and an energy decrease linked to the rather strong spin - orbit interaction predicted by the eob method ) .",
    "our findings fully confirm what was announced in @xcite : the new hkv numerical data are much closer to analytical results than previous numerical data . at face value",
    ", this is a very encouraging fact which suggests that one can now implement the philosophy which was at the basis of the eob approach @xcite : to use a ( resummed ) analytical approach to describe binary black holes not only during early inspiral ( which was previously thought to be the only possible domain of validity for an analytical approach ) , but also during late inspiral and , most importantly , during the transition between inspiral and plunge .",
    "numerical relativity techniques can then be used only for describing the rest of the plunge and the coalescence .",
    "[ as noted in @xcite one might also simplify matters by describing the end of the coalescence by the `` close limit approximation '' . ] a crucial requirement for successfully merging together analytical and numerical results is to be able to match the analytical description just after the last stable orbit ( lso ) with suitable numerical initial data .",
    "this paper is an encouraging step in this direction , in view of the robust and close agreement between eob results and hkv ones .",
    "however , this agreement raises many questions . a first question is linked to the `` approximations '' used in the present implementation of the hkv philosophy . indeed , though this method is not , in principle , limited to conformally flat data , its present implementation has , for simplicity , imposed conformal flatness of the spatial metric , and has reduced the ten equations ( for ten unknowns ) to solve to a subset of five equations ( for five unknowns ) .",
    "the reason why this restriction is problematic is that , from the analytical side , the values of the successive coefficients in the various functions entering the eob formalism depend quite sensitively on the exact form of the metric , and , in particular , on the fact that it is not conformally flat .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that both the `` effective potential '' @xmath72 , and the energy map ( [ eq2.1 ] ) , are modified , at the 2pn approximation , if one truncates einstein equations to impose conformal flatness .",
    "the corresponding modification at the 3pn approximation is currently not known .",
    "however , these modifications might turn out not to be critical in view of the robustness of the eob predictions .",
    "[ f : comp_lso ] shows that even if we use the eob hamiltonian at the 1pn approximation ( which , in fact , essentially coincides with the `` newtonian '' approximation , i.e. the eob reformulation of the `` test - mass approximation '' ) , one is much closer to hkv data than to the other numerical data .      the most important question posed by the agreement analytical / hkv is to understand why the ivp approaches give ( consistently among themselves ) drastically different results .",
    "after all , both types of numerical approaches use ( at present ) the same simplification of spatial conformal flatness @xmath337 , and they both numerically construct solutions to the hamiltonian and momentum constraints ( approximate solution to the momentum constraint for hkv ) . seen from this technical point of view , the difference between the two schemes lies in the way of solving the momentum constraint . in the ivp method",
    "@xcite , it is solved by means of a simple ansatz ( bowen - york extrinsic curvature @xcite or its isometric version @xcite ) for the second fundamental form @xmath338 whose weak - field limit is reasonable , while in the hkv method  @xcite one determines an essentially unique solution for @xmath338 by the requirement that it be induced by restricting a helically - symmetric spacetime to a cauchy hypersurface ( see also @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "we think that the basic physical difference between the two approaches , which underlies their drastically different predictions , is the following . though it must be admitted that the imposition of a helical symmetry can only be an approximation , it is a physically well motivated approximation which has the great virtue of selecting a specific solution of the constraints .",
    "this is very similar to what happens in the post - newtonian schemes , especially in their adm version . indeed , in the hamiltonian adm approach one uses ( when dealing with the near - zone field ) the post - newtonian ansatz @xmath339 to derive and solve an iterative set of coupled _ elliptic _ equations for @xmath340 and @xmath338 .",
    "this selects a specific solution of the constraints .",
    "intuitively , one can think of this ( essentially ) unique solution selected by the pn method as the only solution of the constraints which contains the `` right '' amount of free gravitational wave ( gw ) data @xmath341 which has been generated by the many previous orbits of the system , and which has therefore reached a quasi - stationary state .",
    "any other amount of gw data would be a priori allowed at a specific moment of time but would not correspond to a quasi - stationary state , and would therefore be expected to `` fly away '' with the velocity of light , i.e. to evolve in a violently non quasi - stationary way , with @xmath342 instead of @xmath343 .",
    "we think that this pn understanding of the selection , by reduction to elliptic equations , of a specific `` quasi - stationary '' solution applies , _ mutatis mutandis _ , to the hkv approach .",
    "the imposition of a helical killing vector selects the only `` quasi - stationary '' solution corresponding to a steady situation generated by a slow inspiral , while the arbitrary choice , in the other methods , of a technically simple solution of the momentum constraint corresponds to a drastically non - steady state , containing a wrong amount of free gw data , which is expected to `` fly away '' as soon as one tries to evolve the system in time .",
    "if this view is correct , it diminishes the signification of the `` effective potential '' approach applied to the initial data of @xcite .",
    "indeed , these data correspond to a non - steady state to which it is incorrect to apply any energy minimization principle .",
    "we have started to exploit the `` flexibility '' of the eob approach ( already emphasized in @xcite ) , i.e. the use of the expansion coefficients appearing in the eob approach as parameters to be fitted .",
    "for instance , figs .",
    "[ f : seq_e ] and [ f : seq_j ] exhibit the dynamical predictions obtained from a modified 3pn coefficient , @xmath344 instead of @xmath345 .",
    "the modified value of @xmath249 leads to a better agreement with the hkv data .",
    "as we are not adding any higher pn contributions , @xmath346 , such a best fit value for @xmath249 can be viewed as a way of mimicking the effect of such ( missing ) higher pn terms .",
    "we resisted the temptation to ( introduce and ) vary more @xmath347 parameters up to getting a really close agreement with hkv data , because , at this stage , such a formal exercise would not be justified .",
    "it is , however , important to keep in mind the suggestion made in @xcite that a suitable `` numerically fitted '' eob hamiltonian may be a very useful tool for combining the advantages of analytical and numerical methods .",
    "if we look ahead to the problem of exploring the dynamics of two arbitrarily spinning black holes , one will have to face an extremely large parameter space .",
    "it seems clear that numerical relativity will not be able ( before many years ) to cover densely this parameter space . on the other hand",
    ", one can use some sparse numerical data to determine free parameters introduced in a generalized eob hamiltonian .",
    "then this `` numerically fitted ''",
    "eob hamiltonian can be used to interpolate between the sparse numerical data .",
