    "there is a current interest in the energetics and efficiency of molecular motors and nano engines .",
    "molecular motors are energy - consuming , non - equilibrium nanoscale engines encountered in various dynamical processes on the intra- and intercellular level @xcite ; for a recent review of the more physical aspects see , for instance ref .  @xcite .",
    "linear motor proteins like myosin or kinesin are driven by the hydrolysis of atp into adp and move along linear polar tracks like actin filaments or microtubules .",
    "the motors typically work in an isothermal environment at ambient temperatures subject to viscous forces .",
    "modern experimental techniques in biology and biophysics , in particular single biomolecule manipulation by for example optical tweezers or micro - needles , and single particle tracking methods , have yielded considerable insight into the mechanism and the relevant physical scales in molecular motor behavior , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the typical size of a molecular motor is of order 10 - 20 nm , moving with a step size of order 8 nm , e.g. , kinesin on microtubules , with one atp molecule hydrolyzed on the average per step .",
    "the velocities of molecular motors range from nm / sec to @xmath0 m/s and the maximum load is of the order of several pn .",
    "the time scale of the chemical cycle is a few ms and the average energy input from the atp - adp cycle of order 15 - 20 kt . here",
    "kt is the energy scale of thermal motion at temperature t.    a molecular motor constitutes an interesting non - equilibrium system operating in the classical regime and is thus directly amenable to analysis using methods in statistical physics .",
    "physical modeling of molecular motors has thus been studied intensively in recent years , both from the point of view of the fundamental underlying physical principles and with regard to the specific modelling of concrete motors @xcite .",
    "the most common statistical approach to molecular motors is the ratchet model @xcite modelling the periodically alternating energy landscape felt by the motor during its cycle .",
    "an alternative motor model can be based on protein friction where the motor during its cycle is in contact with a track . @xcite .    in recent work mogilner",
    "@xcite have studied a specific protein friction model .",
    "the motor is represented by two coupled over damped oscillators driven by a two - step markov process alternating between a relaxed and a strained state of the oscillators .",
    "the motor is embedded in a thermal environment represented by additive white noise .",
    "the subprocesses are associated with internal conformational changes of the motor protein .",
    "one subprocess is slow , allowing protein friction to act , while the other is fast and only subject to solvent friction . by means of a numerical analysis mogilner et al .",
    "show that the system acts like a motor and can carry a load .",
    "however , unlike the ratchet models , which operate with an attachment to a periodic polar protein filament , the model of mogilner et al . only needs a ` passive ' groove in order to perform directed motion .",
    "the motion comes about due to the asymmetric internal velocity fluctuations which are then rectified by protein friction . in that sense",
    ", it is a robotic model of molecular motors .",
    "recently , there has been an interest in the efficiency of molecular motors and nano engines @xcite . unlike heat engines where",
    "the efficiency is bounded by carnot s law , see e.g. @xcite , the molecular motors work in an isothermal environment at ambient temperatures and the efficiency can in principle reach unity . the efficiency of a motor is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the output power , i.e. , the work done per unit time on the surroundings .",
    "likewise , @xmath3 is the input energy rate .",
    "the conservation of energy implies @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dissipation rate . here",
    "@xmath3 refers to the energy input to the motor arising from the atp hydrolysis , whereas @xmath5 , the dissipation rate , refers to the frictional effects during the motor operation . @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath5 refer to two different energy reservoirs and there is thus no conflict with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the theoretical upper limit @xmath6 requires the absence of irreversible processes , i.e. , @xmath7 , and can thus only be attained by infinitely slow driving , corresponding to vanishing power .",
    "a more relevant measure of efficiency is therefore for example the efficiency at maximum power ( emp ) , i.e. , @xmath8 in a recent paper @xcite we analyzed the motor model by mogilner et al . from a purely analytical point of view and derived explicit expressions for the motion of the motor and the velocity - load relationship . in the present paper",
    "we return to the analytical solution of the mogilner model and focus on the energetics and efficiency of the model ; these aspects were not considered in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we review the mogilner model and the analytical solution . in sec .",

    "we consider a minimal power stroke model of a motor molecule or nano engine operating in an isothermal environment .",
    "we assume that the motor is driven by the atp hydrolysis . during a cycle",
    "an atp molecule is attached to the motor releasing the free energy @xmath9 .",
    "the motor is composed of two sections or heads , an active head and a passive head . during a conformational change the positions of the heads",
    "change . denoting the equilibrium distance between the heads by @xmath10",
    "we assume that the motor can exist in only two geometrical conformations , corresponding to the values @xmath11 and @xmath12 . during a power stroke induced by the attachment of an atp molecule to the motor and the subsequent hydrolysis of atp the motor undergoes a conformational change from a relaxed state r with geometrical parameter @xmath11 to a strained state s with parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we , moreover , characterize the elastic states of the motor by two spring constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 , referring to the relaxed and strained states , respectively .",
    "the state of the motor is driven by the atp hydrolysis .",
    "this two step stochastic process is modeled by two coupled master equations for the respective probabilities @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the transition rate from the strained state s to the relaxed state r and @xmath19 the rate from r to s. in the stationary state we have @xmath20 simple arguments show that in order to obtain the motor property , i.e. , the motion of the motor in the absence of a load , at least two internal coordinates @xmath21 and @xmath22 are required , accounting for the conformal changes .",
    "the motor , moreover , has to interact with a track . in the mogilner model",
    "the interaction with the track is modeled by a time dependent friction @xmath23 which is synchronized with the atp hydrolysis and the associated conformal transitions assume two values .",
    "when the active head at coordinate @xmath21 is in contact with the track during a cycle we assume that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the so - called protein friction . during the phase where the motor is detached from the track",
    "we assume that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the friction due to the solvent .",
    "this friction is of the order of the stokes value @xmath28 ; here @xmath29 is the size of the motor and @xmath30 the viscosity of the medium .",
    "this scenario , discussed in detail in @xcite is described by the coupled equations of motion @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the time dependent harmonic potential @xmath33 ^ 2 .",

    "the over damped case relevant in biology and , moreover , ignore the thermal noise which takes place on a much faster time scale than the conformational changes in the motor . in ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "we have included a load force @xmath36 acting on the active head at coordinate @xmath21 .    the procedure for solving the motor problem is straightforward .",

    "here we turn to the main issues of the present paper , namely the energetics and efficiency of the atp driven motor model discussed in the previous section .",
    "subject to the atp hydrolysis energy is imparted to the motor , temporarily stored in the spring , dissipated owing to the friction , and performing work on the environment .",
    "energy conservation is expressed in ( [ econ ] ) , i.e. , @xmath60 , where @xmath3 is the energy input rate , @xmath5 the dissipation rate , and @xmath2 the rate of work performed on the surroundings .",

    "a transition with rate @xmath18 excites the motor from the s state to the r state increasing the potential energy .",
    "subsequently , the energy is dissipated by friction until a new transition from state r to state s with rate @xmath19 again increases the potential energy . in fig .",

    "the energy conservation is also easily extracted from the equations of motion ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the dissipation force on the active head , i.e. , the head in contact with the track , is @xmath63 , whereas the dissipation force on the passive or free head is @xmath64 .",

    "the last term is the rate of work performed on the head and tails of the motor .",
    "since the motor does not accumulate energy we can identify the input heat flux @xmath69 , in accordance with the energy balance ( [ econ ] ) .    the mean power given by @xmath70 , where @xmath37 is the mean velocity of the motor , is readily accessible .",

    "here we proceed to discuss the energetics and efficiency of the motor .",

    "the motor is driven by the attachment of atp and the subsequent hydrolysis to adp and p. this chemical reaction triggers the motor as expressed by the rate @xmath19 . during a cycle the system absorbs the energy @xmath9 arising from the atp hydrolysis . consequently , the rate of energy input is @xmath91 , where @xmath19 is the transition rate from the relaxed motor state @xmath29 to the strained motor state @xmath92 .",
    "the amount of energy which the motor can absorb per cycle depends on the actual state of the motor at the moment the hydrolysis takes place , see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "consequently , we can define the intermediate atp related efficiency @xmath93 where @xmath3 is the rate of input energy recovered by the motor .",
    "the size of @xmath94 , while not exceeding @xmath95 , depends on the frictional energy rate , @xmath96 , absorbed by degrees of freedom not included in the present motor model . in that sense @xmath94",
    "is a `` fudge '' parameter which can only be estimated qualitatively .",
    "the efficiency specifically associated with the motor model is given by @xmath97 , where @xmath2 as given by eq .",
    "( [ pow ] ) , expresses the work exerted on the environment .",
    "this efficiency is given by @xmath98 the total efficiency , @xmath99 , relating the power @xmath2 to the atp energy input rate is thus given by the product of the two efficiencies : @xmath100 in discussing the motor efficiency @xmath101 it is useful to first as a reference use the heuristic expressions by mogilner et al . @xcite .",
    "neglecting the internal dynamics of the motor the velocity for @xmath55 is given by @xmath102 in ( [ vel2 ] ) . in the presence of a load @xmath36",
    "the velocity is to a first approximation reduced by @xmath103 , where @xmath25 is the protein friction , i.e. , @xmath104 , with mobility @xmath105 .",
    "a more detailed analysis based on ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , see also @xcite , yields @xmath106 in the relaxed state @xmath29 and @xmath107 in the strained state @xmath92 .",
    "interpolating between the two states we can thus define the effective mobility @xmath108 which agrees with ( [ mob ] ) for @xmath109 .",

    "since the power @xmath146 attains the maximum value @xmath147 for @xmath148 the central quantity determining @xmath149 is the dissipation rate @xmath5 which has a dependence on the load force @xmath36 . referring to the heuristic ansatz we set @xmath150 the correction factor @xmath151",

    "( [ qoutav1 ] ) we obtain for @xmath161 the dissipation rate @xmath162 , i.e. , @xmath163 , and the maximum efficiency drops to @xmath164 , i.e about a per mille .",
    "thus , we find that including the internal dynamics of the motor @xmath149 is reduced from about 10% in the heuristic mogilner case to about 1 per mille in the full motor case .",
    "the dissipation associated with the motor activity acts as a bottle neck reducing @xmath149 .",
    "based on the expressions in appendix [ app ] we have in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] presented a 3d plot of @xmath149 as a function of the dimensionless parameters @xmath165 and @xmath166 characterizing the motor dynamics .",
    "we note that for @xmath165 of order 100 and @xmath166 of order 1000 @xmath149 reaches a plateau at around an @xmath149 of about 10% . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have depicted the corresponding contour plot of @xmath149 as function of @xmath166 and @xmath165 . here the plateau in @xmath149 attained for large @xmath166 and @xmath165 is clearly discernible .    in the limit of large @xmath167",
    "we have @xmath168 , where @xmath169 are the residence times and @xmath170 the spring relaxation times .",
    "consequently , the motor switches rapidly between its internal states and the fluctuations about the internal length @xmath35 are small . based on this approximation",
    "one can derive approximate expressions for @xmath5 and @xmath149 .",
    "the expressions are lengthy and the analysis is therefore deferred to the appendix . among other results",
    "we find that scaling the residence times by a common factor yields invariant expression for @xmath171 and @xmath5 .",

    "[ fig5 ] we depict in a 3d plot the emp , denoted @xmath172 , showing a strong agreement with the exact result in fig .",
    "the fact that the emp is as low as a few per mille at physical motor parameters reflects the opposite limit where the residence times are larger than the spring relaxation times . in this case",
    "the motor spends a long time in the passive mode , where the internal spring is fully relaxed , waiting for the next conformational change to occur .",
    "in this situation all that happens is that the load force pulls the motor backwards contributing negatively to @xmath149 .",
    "since the efficiency evaluated here applies to the motor _ per se _ it is instructive to consider the efficiency relative to the burning of atp , @xmath99 , defined by ( [ effprod ] ) . in fig .",

    "the dissipation associated with the medium and the protein friction acts as an effective bottle neck in the transfer of energy from the atp hydrolysis to the power exerted on the environment .",
    "we stress that our analysis applies to the efficiency of the motor model _",
    "per se _ and not the assembly including the attachment and hydrolysis of atp . including this feature would require an extension of the model",

    "approaching 100% has been reported , in marked contrast to the present results where @xmath149 is of order 10% by a heuristic estimate and furthermore reduced to about 1 per mille when the motor mechanics is included properly .",
