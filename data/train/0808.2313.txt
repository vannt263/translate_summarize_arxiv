    "from the first stages of star and galaxy formation , non - gravitational processes drive together with gravitation the formation and the evolution of structures . the complex physics they involve rule the baryonic component within clusters of galaxies , and in a more general context within the intergalactic medium ( igm hereafter  see the review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the study of these processes is the key to our understanding of the formation and the evolution of large - scale structure of the universe . indeed , understanding how their heating and cooling abilities affect the thermodynamics of the igm at large scales and high redshifts , and thus that of the intra - cluster medium ( hereafter icm ) once the gas get accreted onto massive halos is a major question still to be answered . the continuous accretion and the merger events through which a halo assembled lead to a constant interaction of the igm gas with the evolving galactic component . within denser environments , like clusters ,",
    "feedback provided by agn balances the gas cooling ( see for instance @xcite , and @xcite for a review ) . also , from high redshift , the rate of supernovae drives the strength of the galactic winds and thus the amount of material that ends ejected within the igm and the icm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these ejecta are then mixed in the environment by the action of the surrounding gravitational potential and the dynamics of cluster galaxies within .    since long",
    ", x - ray observations have shown the abundant presence of heavy elements within the icm ( see for instance review works by @xcite ) .",
    "physical processes like ram - pressure stripping , agn interaction with the icm , galaxy - galaxy interaction or mergers are scrutinized within analytical models and numerical simulations in order to explain the presence of metals ( see for instance works by @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it is obvious that the process of tearing of material from galaxies leads not only to the enrichment of the icm / igm in metal , but in gas , stars and dust as well .",
    "recent work on numerical simulations @xcite have stressed the role of hierarchical buiding of structures in enriching the icm with stars in a consistent way with the observed amount of icm globular clusters , and icm light .",
    "indeed , the overall light coming from stars in between cluster galaxies represent an important fraction of the total cluster light : for instance @xcite measured 6 to 22% from a sample of 10 clusters .",
    "the effect of a diffuse dust component within the igm / icm , and its effect is less known . a few observational studies with the iso and the spitzer satellites have tried without frank success to detect the signature of such a component @xcite .",
    "more successfully , @xcite have obtained a statistical detection , via a stacking analysis , of the overall infrared emission coming from clusters of galaxies .",
    "however , they were not able to disentangle the ir signal from dusty cluster galaxies from a possible icm dust component .",
    "on the other hand , from a theoretical point of view a few works have looked at the effect of dust on the icm @xcite or in conjunction with the enrichment of the icm in metals @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of dust on a icm / igm - type thermalized plasma has been formalized by @xcite .",
    "these authors have computed the cooling function of dust taking into account the energetic budget for dust .",
    "they have shown the ability of dust to be a non negligible cooling / heating vector depending on the physical properties of the environment .",
    "dust thus comes , within the icm / igm , as an added source of non - gravitational physics that can potentially influence the formation and the evolution of large scale structure in a significant way . indeed , since redshift of @xmath5 during which the star formation activity reached its maximum in the cosmic history , large amounts of dust has been produced and thus ejected out of the galaxies due to violent galactic winds into the igm @xcite . as this material",
    "is then accreted by the forming halos , one can wonder about the impact produced by dust on the overall properties of clusters of galaxies once assembled and thermalized . in a hierarchical universe , the population of clusters is self - similar , thus is expected to present well defined structural and scaling properties .",
    "however , to date , it is common knowledge that the observed properties deviate form the prediction by a purely gravitational model ( see @xcite for review works ) .",
    "it is thus important to address the issue of the impact of dust on the statistical properties of structures such as clusters of galaxies , the same way it is done for agns , supernovae , stripping or mergers .    in order to tackle this question ,",
    "we have put into place the first n - body numerical simulations of hierarchical structure formation implementing the cooling effect of dust according to the dust nature and abundance . in this paper , we present the first results of this work focusing at the scale of galaxy clusters , and more specifically on their scaling properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start by presenting the physical dust model and how it is implemented in the numerical simulation code . in sec .  [",
    "sec : sinum ] , we describe the numerical simulations and the various runs ( i.e. model ) that have been tested . from these simulations",
    "our analysis concerns the galaxy cluster scale , and focus on the impact of the presence of dust on the scaling relation of clusters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scal ] , we present our results on the @xmath6 , the @xmath7 , the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 relations . the derived results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] and discussed in sec.[sec : dis ] .",
    "in our numerical simulations the implementation of the physical effect of dust grains is based on the computation by @xcite of the dust heating / cooling function . in this work",
    ", we decided to limit our implementation to the dust cooling effect only . indeed",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the effect of dust at the galaxy cluster scales .",
    "the heating by dust grains is mainly effective at low temperatures ( i.e @xmath10  k ) and is a localised effect strongly dependent of the uv radiation field . our numerical simulations ( see sec .  [ sec : sinum ] and [ sec : limit ] )",
    "do not directly implement this level of physics .",
    "dust grains in a thermal plasma with @xmath11  k are destroyed by thermal sputtering , which efficiency was quantified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their eq .",
    "the sputtering time depends on the column density and on the grain size . for grain sizes ranging form @xmath12 m to @xmath13 m , and an optically thin plasma ( @xmath14  atom/@xmath15 )",
    ", the dust lifetime spawns from @xmath16  yr for small grains up to @xmath17  yr for big grains .",
    "this lifetimes are therefore large enough for the cooling by dust in the igm / icm to be considered .",
    "evidently , it is also strongly linked to the injection rate of dust , thus to the physical mechanism that can bring and spread dust in the igm / icm .",
    "our implementation of the dust cooling power is based on the model by @xcite .",
    "we recall bellow the main aspects of this model and describe the practical implementation within the @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "dust grains within a thermal gas such as the icm or the igm can either be a heating or a cooling vector depending on the physical state of the surrounding gas and on the radiative environment .",
    "heating can occur via the photo - electric effect if the stellar radiation field ( stars and/or qsos ) is strong enough ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , the binding energies of electrons in dust grains are small , thus allowing electrons to be more easily photo - detached than in the case of a free atom or a molecule . on the other hand , the cooling by dust occurs through re - radiation in the ir of the collisional energy deposited on grains by impinging free electrons of the icm / igm .",
    "@xcite have computed the balance of the heating and cooling by dust with respect to the dust abundance : cooling by dust dominates at high temperatures in the hot igm of virialized structures ( i.e clusters of galaxies ) , and heating by dust dominates in low temperature plasma under high radiation fluxes such as in the proximity of quasars .",
    "the details , of course , depend on the local physical parameters such as the grain size and the gas density .",
    "assuming local thermal equilibrium for the dust , the overall balance between heating and cooling in dust grains can be written as follows : @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the collisional heating function of the grain and @xmath20 the cooling function due to thermal radiation of dust .",
    "@xmath21 is the grain size , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the electronic temperature and density of the medium and @xmath24 is the dust grain temperature .",
    "the heating of the dust grain was taken from @xcite and can be expressed in a general way as : @xmath25 where the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dependent of the value of the ratio @xmath28 .",
    "the relevant dust parameters affecting the cooling function are the grain size and the metallicity . indeed , the smaller the grains and the higher the metallicity , the higher is the cooling power of the dust .",
    "thus the total cooling function due to a population of dust grains can be expressed as a function of these two parameters as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the differential number of dust grains per size , metallicity and volume element .",
    "cooling by dust happens to increase with the square root of the gas density , whereas the heating by dust is proportional to the density .",
    "as stressed by @xcite the cooling by dust is more efficient within the temperature range of @xmath31  k ( i.e @xmath32  kev ) , which is typically the igm and icm thermal conditions .",
    "we redirect the reader to @xcite for a full description of the dust model , and a comprehensive physical analysis of the effect of dust in a optically thin plasma .",
    "the abundance of dust is a key ingredient to properly weight in our implementation .",
    "observations indicate that dust represents only a tiny fraction of the baryonic matter : @xmath33 in our milky way @xcite , and this is possibly lower by a factor 100 to 1000 in the icm : @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we defined the abundance of dust as the ratio of the dust mass with respect to the gas mass : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the metallicity in units of solar metallicity , @xmath37 is the solar dust abundance , i.e the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the solar vincinity @xcite , and @xmath38 is the abundance of dust in the icm in units of solar dust abundance .",
    "dust enrichment occurs via the feedback of galaxy formation and evolution in the icm through interaction , stripping , mergers , galactic winds and agns outburst .",
    "at all redshifts , it is linked to the sfr which drives the production of dust in cluster galaxies . however , in our hydrodynamic simulations ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : sinum ] ) the sfr is not physically modeled , but it is inferred by the cooling state of the gas particles within the simulations : gas particles below a given threshold of temperature and above a given threshold of density are considered as colisionless matter , forming stars and galaxies ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sinum ] ) . in order to tackle this problem ,",
    "we choose to directly link the dust abundance to the metal abundance using eq .",
    "( [ eq : zd ] ) .",
    "therefore , the dust distribution in our simulations mimics the metal distribution .      from the equations presented in the previous sections ,",
    "we computed the dust cooling function according to the embedding medium temperature and ( global ) metallicity . in simulations , once the metallicity and temperature are known , @xmath21 and @xmath38 are the only two parameters driving the dust cooling rate ( i.e @xmath39 ) . in the top panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : tmw - m_zevol ] we see a sytematic variation with the dust model ( ordered in the following way : c , d4 ,",
    "d3 , d2 , d1 ) , but differences between models are within the errors and fit dispersions of each others . for the evolution of the normalisations of the @xmath3 , @xmath131 , and @xmath1 scalings ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : s - m_zevol ] , [ fig : y - m_zevol ] , and [ fig : lxb - m_zevol ] ) we conclude that the inclusion of dust cooling causes significant departures from the standard radiative cooling model depending on the dust model parameters .",
    "for example , this is clear from the non - overlapping errors and fit dispersions of the normalisations for the d2 and d1 models . for all scalings ,",
    "the relative strength of the effect of dust follows the relative intensity of the cooling functions presented in section  [ sec : impmod ] .",
    "this orders the models in the following way : c , d4 , d3 , d2 , d1 with increasing normalisations for the @xmath142 and @xmath3 scalings and decreasing normalisations for the @xmath131 and @xmath133 relations .",
    "we end this section by noting that we find positive evolution ( relative to the expected self - similar evolution , i.e. for a given @xmath121 in eq  ( [ eqyx ] ) the property @xmath143 is higher at higher redshifts ) for the @xmath131 and @xmath133 ( models d1 and d2 only ) relations whereas the @xmath4 , and @xmath3 relations show negative evolutions relative to the self - similar model .",
    "this is in line with the findings from simulations with radiative cooling of similar size and cosmology , see eg @xcite .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm",
    "in agreement with the cooling functions of @xcite , the dust cooling is most effective in the cluster temperature regime .",
    "the relative importance of the dust cooling with respect to the gas radiative cooling is strongly dependent on the dust abundances and the intrinsic physical properties of the dust .",
    "this is clearly shown in our scaling relations results :    * the @xmath4 relation is almost unchanged when adding dust cooling to the radiative gas cooling ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tmw - m_zevol ] ) .",
    "our results show that the ( mass weighted ) temperature  mass relation within @xmath81 , is essentially driven by the gravitational heating of the gas ( due to its infall on the cluster potential well ) , and that the physics of baryons ( at least for the physics implemented in the simulations presented in this paper ) play very little role in the outer parts of halos which dominate the estimation of the mass - weighted temperature and integrated mass .",
    "since gas cooling tends to disturb the dark matter distribution at the centre of clusters in high resolution simulations @xcite , the cooling by dust may amplify this effect , and thus modify scaling relations like the @xmath4 . in the case of observationally derived quantities",
    ", scaling laws will be drawn from overall quantities that will proceed from mixed - projected information over a wide range of radii .",
    "if a gradient exist in the dust effect towards the cluster centre , an `` overall '' temperature might bear the signature of the structural effect of dust . anyway",
    "this quantification is beyond the scope of this paper and will be investigated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "there is also no significant effect between the different dust models and the radiative case on the evolution of the slope and normalisation of the @xmath4 relation .",
    "* on the other hand the other three scaling laws are deeply related to the clusters baryonic component .",
    "the clear effect on the @xmath3 , @xmath131 , and @xmath1 relations illustrates this fact ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : s - m_zevol ] , [ fig : y - m_zevol ] , and [ fig : lxb - m_zevol ] ) .",
    "we found that the slopes of these scalings remain fairly insensitive to dust , whereas normalisations show significant changes depending on the dust parameters .",
    "relative changes in the normalisations at redshift zero and @xmath115 can be as high as 25% for @xmath1 and 10% for the @xmath3 , @xmath131 relations for the d1 model .",
    "models with lower dust abundances and mrn grain size distributions present smaller but systematic variations relative to the c model . as any other cooling process , the cooling due to dust tends to lower the normalisations of the @xmath131 , and @xmath144 scalings due to the decrease of the hot gas fractions and densities which dominate the increase of temperature .",
    "the increase of normalisations for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 relations with added dust cooling is also in line with expectations because cooling converts cold , dense , gas into collisionless star forming material , which raises the mean temperature and entropy of the remaining gas . *",
    "our simulations allow us to quantify the relative impact of the dust parameters on the investigated cluster scalings ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : tmw - m_zevol ] to [ fig : lxb - m_zevol ] and table  [ tab_best_fit ] ) . from one model to another one can identify two clear effects due to dust : ( i ) it shows the expected effect of the dust abundance , which from models d4 to d2 raise by a factor of 10 , producing a change of normalisations relative to the purely radiative case ( model c ) , from almost zero percent contribution to about 14% , 5% and 6% contributions for the @xmath1 , @xmath131 and @xmath3 relations , respectively .",
    "( ii ) even more striking is the effect of the intrinsic dust grain physical properties .",
    "the variation of normalisations relative to the c model , change from a zero percent level for model d4 to about 25% ( @xmath144 ) and 10% ( @xmath131 , and @xmath3 ) for the model d1 ( ie the relative change from models d2 to d1 is about 13% and 5% , respectively ) .",
    "all these percentages were calculated using normalisations at redshift zero and @xmath145 .",
    "therefore the size of the grains comes to be an equally important parameter varying the efficiency of the dust cooling .",
    "the smaller the grain , the stronger the cooling . * from figs .  [",
    "fig : tmw - m_zevol ] , [ fig : s - m_zevol ] , [ fig : y - m_zevol ] , and [ fig : lxb - m_zevol ] one finds that differences between normalisations become progressively important with decreasing redshift .",
    "this confirms expectations because metallicity was modelled in simulations as a linearly increasing function of time .",
    "although our implementation of metallicity should only be regarded as a first order approximation to the modelling of more complex physical processes ( acting on scales below the resolution scale of the present set simulations ) , it would be interesting to investigate whether a similar effect remains ( ie the effects of dust become progressively important at low redshift ) when such processes are taken into account throughout the formation history of galaxy clusters ( see discussion below ) .",
    "+      in order to implement the presence of dust in the numerical simulations , we chose a `` zero order approach '' : we directly correlated the presence of dust with the presence of metals under the assumption that there is no segregation in the nature of the material withdrawn from galaxies and injected in the igm / icm ( metals , gas , stars or dust ) .",
    "however , this assumption suffers from limitations linked to the dust lifetime . indeed",
    ", dust grains strongly suffer of sputtering and within their lifetime they are depleted from metals which , contrary to dust grains , are not destroyed i.e. remain in the icm / igm .",
    "therefore our whole analysis is to be considered within the framework of this assumption , and is to be understood as a basic implementation of the effects of dust with the objective of assessing whether dust has a significant impact on large scale structure formation , and consequently to quantify these effects at first order .",
    "moreover , our implementation is also _",
    "ad hoc_. indeed , beside the cooling function of dust , our implementation is not a physical implementation .",
    "we did not deal _ stricto senso _ with the physics of the dust creation and dust destruction processes .",
    "this would be a step further , and is yet beyond the scope of this paper as mentioned above .",
    "however , making use of the cooling function by @xcite , we have performed a fully self - consistent implementation of the effect of dust as a cooling vector of the icm / igm .",
    "indeed , on the basis of the cooling function , the implementation encapsulates the major physical processes to which dust is subjected and acts as a non - gravitational process at the scale of the icm and the igm .",
    "as already mentioned , we directly correlated the abundance of dust with metallicity , thus to the metallicity evolution , which chosen evolution law is quite drastic : @xmath55 . indeed ,",
    "if the metallicity at @xmath118 is normalized to the value of @xmath146 , it is lowered to @xmath147 at @xmath148 and @xmath149 at @xmath71 . however , other numerical works based on simulations including physical implementation of metal enrichment processes but without dust agree well with observational constraints ( mainly provided by x - ray observations of the fe - k line ) which indicate high metalicity values , @xmath150 , up to redshifts above 1.0 @xcite .",
    "this shows that , as for the stellar component which is already in place in galaxies when clusters form , the metal enrichment of the icm / igm has occured through the feedback of galaxy formation and evolution , and therefore it _ de facto _ strongly enriched the igm / icm bellow @xmath71 .",
    "it also might give hints that the high metallicity of clusters could be correlated to the dust enrichment of the igm / icm .",
    "indeed , the amount of gaseous iron in galaxies such as the milky way is @xmath151z@xmath152 .",
    "an early enrichment of dust in the igm and/or the icm , which once sputtered will provide metals , could explain part of the iron abundances found in the icm at low redshifts .",
    "this hypothesis seems to be consolidated by the few works that have investigated dust as a source for metals in the material stripped from galaxies via dynamical removal within already formed clusters @xcite or via an early igm enrichment at high redshift during the peak of star formation around @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "the latter work stressed that only big grains ( @xmath154 m ) can be transported on a few 100kpc physical scale , however leading to a very inhomogenous spatial enrichment in metals once the dust grains are sputtered .",
    "for all these reasons , by underestimating the metallicity at high redshifts , we might have underestimated the amount of dust injected in the icm at high redshift , and thus the efficiency of dust cooling when integrated from early epoch down to redshift zero",
    "in this work , we have presented the first simulations of structure formation investigating the effect of dust cooling on the properties of the intra - cluster medium .",
    "we have compared simulations with radiative @xmath155 dust cooling with respect to a purely radiative cooling simulation .",
    "we have shown that :    * the cooling due to dust is effective at the cluster regime and has a significant effect on the `` baryon driven '' statistical properties of cluster such as @xmath1 , @xmath2,@xmath3 scaling relations . as an added non - gravitational cooling process dust changes the normalisation of these laws by a factor up to 27% for the @xmath1 relation , and up to 10% for the @xmath131 and @xmath3 relations . on the contrary",
    ", dust has almost no effect on a `` dark matter driven '' scaling relation such as the @xmath4 relation . *",
    "the inclusion of cooling by dust does not change significantly the slopes of the cluster scaling laws investigated in this paper .",
    "they compare with the results obtained in the radiative cooling simulation model .",
    "* through the implementation of our different dust models , we have demonstrated that the dust cooling effect at the scale of clusters depends strongly on the dust abundance in the icm , but also on a similar proportion on the size distribution of dust grains . therefore the dust efficiency is strongly dependent on the nature of the stripped and ejected galactic material , as well as the history of these injection and destruction processes along the cluster history .",
    "indeed the early enrichment of dust might provide an already modified thermodynamical setup for the `` to - be - accreted '' gas at lower redshifts .",
    "the setup of our simulations and the limitation of our dust implementation can be considered at a `` zero order '' test with which we demonstrated the active effect of dust on structure formation and especially at the cluster scale . in order to go one step further",
    ", a perspective of this work will be needed to couple the radiative cooling function of dust with a physical and dynamical implementation of the creation and destruction processes of dust in the igm / icm .",
