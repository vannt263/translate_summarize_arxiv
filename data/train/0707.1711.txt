    "the circumstellar habitable zone ( hz ) is the distance annulus within which a terrestrial planet can maintain liquid water on its surface .",
    "the average distance of the hz from the parent star depends primarily on the star s luminosity , and is closer - in and narrower around lower - mass stars ( kasting 1993 ) . for a planet to remain habitable",
    ", it must control its surface temperature over long timescales , possibly via the co@xmath6-carbonate cycle ( walker 1981 ) , which is enabled by a relatively thick atmosphere , a hydrological cycle , and active plate tectonics .",
    "these planetary characteristics are less likely to be sustained over long periods by less massive terrestrial planets , or those with low water contents . whether potentially habitable planets of sufficient mass will form depends on the surface density of rocky material in their parent protoplanetary disks .",
    "disks with higher surface densities tend to form a smaller number of more massive planets ( wetherill 1996 ; raymond 2004 , kokubo 2006 ) , and can increase terrestrial planet water content by scattering more distant , water - rich material into the hz ( morbidelli 2000 ; raymond 2004 , 2005a ) .    here",
    "we investigate the formation , masses and water contents of terrestrial planets as a function of stellar mass by assuming a parameterized relationship between disk and stellar mass .",
    "we adopt a simple model relating the hz planet mass to the disk mass , based on results in the literature .",
    "we use a set of numerical simulations of terrestrial planet growth around stars between 0.2 and 1 @xmath5 to test the validity of the model .",
    "the simulations agree well with the model , and justify an exploration of the consequences of such a planet - disk - stellar mass relation , and in addition allow us to consider how water delivery is affected as a function of stellar mass .",
    "our main result is to derive probabilistic limits on the stellar mass below which sustainably habitable planets can not form because of insufficient disk mass available for accretion to a critical planet mass of 0.3 @xmath7 . in addition , we show how this stellar mass limit depends on the parameters of the disk - star mass relationship , which is currently poorly constrained . in a statistical framework , we show that the fraction of stars capable of forming habitable planets _ in situ _ decreases quickly with decreasing stellar mass , and that terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of m stars ( @xmath8 ; e.g. , reid & hawley 2000 ) are likely to be small and dry",
    ". an interesting test of our models comes from the recent detection of a @xmath9 planet close to the habitable zone of the m dwarf gliese 581 ( udry 2007 ) . the implications of this system for our formation models are discussed in section 4 .    to simplify our calculations , we assume there are no gas giant ( jovian ) planets present , and we test the effects of this assumption in section 3.3 .",
    "systems without giant planets may represent the majority of planetary systems with habitable planets .",
    "available estimates of the fraction of solar - like stars with massive planets ( tabachnick & tremaine 2002 , lineweaver & grether 2004 , beer 2004 ; fischer & valenti 2005 ) allow for 70 - 90% of stars to have planetary systems without jovians , and an even larger fraction for lower - mass stars ( endl 2006 ; butler 2006 ) .",
    "in addition , scholz ( 2006 ) point out that estimated submm and mm outer disk masses show that only a small fraction of low - mass stars or substellar objects have sufficient disk mass to form a planet with the mass of jupiter ( but see hartmann 2006 ) .",
    "the lack of a correlation between the presence of debris disks and the metallicity of the parent star ( greaves 2006 ; beichman 2006 ; moro - martn 2007 ) , unlike the correlation known for exogiant planets ( gonzalez 1997 , santos , fischer & valenti 2005 ) , also supports the likelihood of gas - giant - free planetary systems .",
    "there are observational ( endl 2006 ; butler 2006 ) and theoretical ( ward & hahn 1995 ; adams 2004 ; laughlin 2004 , ida & lin 2005 ) reasons to think that the fraction of m stars with jovian planets is significantly smaller than for solar - mass stars .",
    "following williams ( 1997 ) , we assume a lower mass limit for planetary habitability that supports active plate tectonics for several gyr . significant mass is a necessary , but not sufficient , requirement for sustainable planetary habitability ( e.g. , lissauer 1999 ) . using the radioactive flux limit from williams ( 1997 ) , the critical planetary mass scales like @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the planet s bulk density , @xmath12 for @xmath13u , and @xmath14 is the duration of tectonic activity . for an active lifetime of 5 gyr , and iterating on the density to be consistent with the resulting critical mass , we get a critical mass of 0.3 @xmath7 for a density of 4.5 @xmath15 .",
    "this result is sensitive to the plate tectonic activity timescale associated with sustained habitability , which is fairly arbitrary .",
    "the average age of stars in the galactic disk is about 5 gyr , so the choice of 5 gyr allows about half of such stars with sustainably habitable planets to be on the main sequence today , for a roughly constant star formation rate . throughout the paper we consider 0.3 @xmath7 as our critical mass limit for planetary habitability , and we discuss the implications of changing this limit in section 4 .",
    "we assume the surface density of protoplanetary disks , @xmath16 , to scale with heliocentric distance @xmath17 as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the surface density of solids at 1 au in the minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 adjusts the density scaling with @xmath22 , @xmath2 is a scaling factor for the disk ( @xmath2=1 for mmsn ) , @xmath23 is the stellar metallicity ( 1.0=solar ) , and @xmath24 moderates the steepness of the density profile ( @xmath25 in the mmsn model ; hayashi 1981 , but more recent reconstructions using an accretion disk model as a constraint gives @xmath26 ; davis 2005 ) .",
    "most disk models that include viscous and irradiation heating give @xmath24 between about 1/2 and 1 for the inner disk ( e.g. dalessio 1998 ; garaud & lin 2007 , dullemond et al .",
    "2007 ) , and high - resolution submillimeter observations suggest @xmath24 between 1/2 and 1 in the outer disk ( mundy 2000 , looney et al .",
    "2003 , andrews and williams 2006 ) .",
    "we take @xmath27 as a fiducial value but consider values in the range 1/2 to 3/2 .",
    "present estimates of disk masses in nearby star - forming regions ( see andre & montmerle 1994 , eisner & carpenter 2003 , andrews & williams 2005 ) give a large spread , with median or average masses usually somewhat below the mmsn value , but a significant fraction more massive , including a very massive disks observed in both orion and taurus ( e.g. williams 2005 , eisner & carpenter 2006 ) . at the other end of the mass spectrum , the estimates by williams ( 2005 ) of mean masses for 18 orion proplyds below the @xmath28 detection limit yielded @xmath29 , or only @xmath30 in solids for a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 . there also exists a factor of 3 - 5 range in metallicity for thin - disk stars ( nordstrom 2004 ) , which adjusts the effective gas - to - dust ratio .    there is considerable uncertainty in the scaling between stellar mass @xmath22 and disk mass @xmath31 .",
    "the most promising lead comes from estimates of outer disk masses using submm and mm techniques ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ) , which remain uncertain because of adopted dust temperatures , opacities , distances , and radiative transfer model .",
    "scholz ( 2006 ) estimated disk masses for brown dwarf disks and combined their results with previous determinations for stellar and substellar objects from 0.02 to 3 @xmath32 .",
    "their fig .",
    "3 shows that the ratio of disk mass to stellar mass is roughly constant with stellar mass , with a large amount of scatter .",
    "this hints that @xmath33 , with a large range in @xmath2 .",
    "many of the data points from scholz ( 2006 ) are only upper limits , but we think extreme cases @xmath34 or @xmath35 would be apparent in this data .",
    "additional clues come from the observed stellar accretion rate @xmath36 , which scales as @xmath37 , with a large dispersion ( muzerolle 2003 , 2005 , natta 2006 ) .",
    "it might therefore seem natural to assume that @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath21=2 , assuming that the viscous timescale is independent of stellar mass ( e.g. , ida & lin 2005 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "nearly all accretion disk models predict @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "this matter is still unresolved ; several solutions have been proposed ( see padoan 2006 ; alexander and armitage 2006 ; dullemond 2006 ; hartmann 2006 ; gregory 2007 ) including selection / detection limitations ( clarke & pringle 2006 ) .",
    "most of these models are consistent with @xmath33 .",
    "although @xmath21 is currently poorly constrained , we emphasize its importance for understanding whether sustainable hz planets can form around low - mass stars .",
    "given the results of scholz ( 2006 ) , we choose @xmath41 as our fiducial case , but explore the effects of @xmath21 from 0.5 to 2 .",
    "we performed dynamical simulations to evaluate the scaling between terrestrial planet mass and disk properties .",
    "for all runs , our starting conditions reflect our fiducial case , with @xmath42 , @xmath41 , and @xmath43 .",
    "we vary the mass of the central star from 0.2 to 1 @xmath5 . given the surface density profile from eq ( 1 ) , we assume that planetary embryos have formed throughout the inner disk of each star .",
    "we assume that the disk evolved following the standard model of terrestrial planet growth ( e.g. chambers 2004 ) : grains coalesced to form km - sized planetesimals ; and embryos formed from planetesimals via runaway and oligarchic growth ( e.g. , kokubo & ida 1998 ) , spaced by 5 - 10 mutual hill radii ( @xmath44 ; @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the orbital radii and @xmath47 and @xmath48 the masses of two adjacent embryos ) .",
    "for the case of 1 @xmath5 , we generated a population of @xmath49 75 embryos from 0.5 to 4 au , totaling 4.95 @xmath7 .",
    "for other stellar masses , we assume the population of embryos has the same temperature , as we are interested in hz planets ( defined to have the same temperature ) , and the feeding zone boundaries should scale in the same way as the hz mean distance .",
    "we therefore scale the inner and outer boundaries by the stellar flux ( i.e. , as the luminosity @xmath50 ) , using a mass - luminosity relation from scalo ( 2007 ) that is a fit to data from hillenbrand & white ( 2004 ) : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "table 1 summarizes our starting conditions for each stellar mass .",
    "note the variations in the number of embryos @xmath54 included in each simulation , from @xmath49 75 for the 1 @xmath5 simulations to almost 200 for the 0.2 @xmath5 simulations .",
    "this variation in @xmath54 is due to the hill radius being very small at the small orbital distances studied for lower - mass stars . in other words , models of embryo growth",
    "predict that there really are more embryos in these inner disks than in the more distant regions studied for higher - mass stars ( e.g. , kokubo & ida 1998 ) .",
    "kokubo ( 2006 ) showed that the bulk properties of accreted planets are not particularly sensitive to such variations in @xmath54 , so we are not concerned that our choice of embryo formation models will affect our results .",
    "note also that the @xmath55 star has less than 0.3 @xmath7 in its entire disk , so it serves primarily to tell us about the efficiency with which the disk mass is used to make planets under these conditions , but can not form a habitable planet according to our criterion . each numerical experiment",
    "was run independently four times starting from different random initial embryo positions for a total of twenty simulations .",
    "we give embryos random starting eccentricities @xmath560.02 and inclinations @xmath560.1 degrees .",
    "embryos are assigned water contents based on values from our solar system , where asteroids beyond @xmath492.5 au contain significant quantities of water ( abe 2000 ; see fig . 2 in raymond 2004 ) .",
    "we assumed that this boundary between `` dry '' and `` wet '' embryos ( called the `` water line '' in table 1 ) scales with the stellar flux . k and",
    "water ice can condense ( 2.7 au in the mmsn ; hayashi 1981 ) .",
    "rather , we are simply assuming this boundary to divide dry and wet material .",
    "the water line may actually be located somewhat interior to the snow line , as water - rich bodies can be shifted inward via either gas drag or by eccentricity pumping during embryo formation ( e.g. , cyr 1998 ; kokubo & ida 1998 ) . ] embryos beyond this boundary contain 5% water by mass , and those inside are dry ( table 1 ) .",
    "we integrated each simulation for 200 myr using the hybrid integrator _ mercury _ ( chambers 1999 ) .",
    "timesteps were chosen to sample the innermost body s orbit at least twenty times ( e.g. , rauch & holman 1999 ; levison & duncan 2000 ; see table 1 ) , and so varied with each set of simulations , from 6 days for 1 @xmath5 to 0.2 days for 0.2 @xmath5 .",
    "collisions were treated as inelastic mergers conserving water .",
    "figure  [ fig : aet ] shows the evolution of a simulation for a @xmath57 star : the disk is excited by gravitational perturbations among the embryos . as eccentricities increase , orbits cross and collisions occur . in time , a few planets grow and the number of bodies dwindles .",
    "embryos may be scattered far from their original locations , sometimes delivering water - rich material to planets in the inner regions .",
    "water delivery occurs relatively late , because multiple scattering events are needed for significant radial movement ( raymond 2007 ) . in this case",
    "some water delivery occurred : a 0.21 @xmath7 planet formed at 0.41 au , just beyond the outer boundary of the hz , accreted two water - rich embryos originating beyond the water line at 0.61 au .",
    "however , no water was delivered to any planets in the hz in this case .",
    "this is a typical outcome for the low - mass disks expected to be common around low - mass stars ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mall ] shows the final outcome of ten simulations , with the solar system included for scale ( the earth s water content is @xmath58 ; lcuyer 1998 ) .",
    "it is clear that , for our assumptions of @xmath59 , @xmath27 and @xmath60 , terrestrial planets are much smaller around low - mass stars .",
    "in addition , planets that form in the hzs of low - mass stars tend to be dry , and more closely spaced .",
    "note that , although we do not follow their orbits for a full 5 gyr , we assume water - rich planets that form in the hz to be potentially habitable .",
    "very late - stage instabilities were not seen in any of these simulations , nor in the @xmath61gyr integrations from raymond ( 2005a , 2006a ) , but the potential disruption of the system at times as late as 5 gyr can not be ruled out .",
    "in addition , a late - stage instability could potentially alter the orbit of a distant planet , causing it to collide with a planet in the hz .",
    "such an event could even deliver water at a very late stage .",
    "although this is certainly possible , we have found this type of event to be rare in previous long - term simulations .",
    "in addition , the source of such a rogue planet would have to be quite far out , because accretion tends to occur faster closer to the star , and crossing orbits are needed to cause a strong scattering event .",
    "figure  [ fig : mpl ] shows the mean mass of simulated planets that formed in the hz as a function of stellar mass , with error bars representing the range of outcomes from the four simulations for a given stellar mass @xmath62 .",
    "the solid curve shows the prediction of a simple scenario in which the mass of a planet in the hz is proportional to the mass contained within the hz annulus , such that @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the inner and outer boundaries of the hz ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this model is a very simple , but not unreasonable , approximation for planet mass , and the quality of the fit is remarkable  note that this model was calibrated such that a disk with @xmath42 will form a 1 @xmath7 planet in the hz around a solar - mass star .",
    "kokubo ( 2006 ) showed that the planet mass scales roughly linearly with the available mass , albeit for a fixed stellar mass , and we independently found the same result for @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , kokubo ( 2006 ) found a slightly stronger than linear correlation , @xmath67 .",
    "fig  [ fig : mall ] shows that the mean interplanetary spacing decreases somewhat for lower - mass stars , and that there are slightly more planets for the lower - mass stars .",
    "we know that the total mass in the habitable zone , @xmath68 , is equal to the number of planets , @xmath54 , times the average planet mass , @xmath69 .",
    "our simulations suggest that @xmath70 or so .",
    "indeed , a model with @xmath71 provides a fit that is comparable to the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : mall ] .",
    "however , for the remainder of the paper we assume that @xmath72 ( eqn 2 ) .",
    "the reason for this assumption has to do with the goals of the paper .",
    "we are attempting to constrain the locations in @xmath73 parameter space that might harbor potentially habitable planets with @xmath74 . to be conservative in our evaluations",
    ", we prefer to slightly overestimate , rather than underestimate , @xmath69 .",
    "the difference between the two estimates is negligible for larger stellar masses , but is as much as @xmath49 40% below 0.1 @xmath5",
    ".    the planet mass decreases monotonically with stellar mass for all reasonable parameter values ( eq . 2 ; fig  [ fig : mpl ] ) , with a scatter in the details of a given system based on the stochastic nature of the accretion process ( e.g. , wetherill 1996 ) .",
    "only for very steep density profiles ( @xmath75 ) or reversed disk mass scalings ( @xmath76 ) can the planet mass increase at lower stellar masses .",
    "these effects are the result of the strong dependence of the hz s location s on stellar luminosity , and therefore on stellar mass . for a given value of @xmath2 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 ,",
    "there exists a stellar mass limit below which the formation of a @xmath77 planet in the hz is unlikely . for @xmath27 and @xmath41 ,",
    "this limit ranges from 1 @xmath5 for @xmath78 to 0.74 @xmath32 for @xmath42 to 0.43 @xmath32 for @xmath79 .",
    "these limits clearly depend on the critical mass for habitability ; for instance , the limit is 0.53 @xmath5 for the @xmath42 case if the critical habitable mass is 0.1 @xmath7 . recall that @xmath80 represents a scaling of the disk mass , i.e. , the disk s relative mass @xmath2 times the relative abundance of solids , assumed to scale with the stellar metallicity @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mstar - h ] shows the location in @xmath81 space where planets @xmath77 can form in the hz , assuming @xmath43 .",
    "each curve corresponds to a given value of @xmath21 ; planets @xmath82 form above and to the right of each curve .",
    "more massive or metal - rich disks can form habitable planets around lower - mass stars .",
    "in addition , it is easier to form @xmath83 planets in the hz for more centrally - condensed disks , i.e. , for larger values of @xmath24 ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar - h ] ) . given the large amount of variation in @xmath80 and other uncertainties , we do not consider these limits to be firm .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties and expected variation in @xmath2 and other parameters , we do not consider these limits to be meaningful except in a statistical sense .",
    "for an ensemble of disks , the fraction of @xmath77 planets that form decreases significantly for low - mass stars .",
    "a probabilistic version of the mass limit estimate is discussed further in  4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : tf ] shows the mean formation timescales for hz planets in our simulations . around 0.2 @xmath5 stars , terrestrial planets in the hz form in a few myr",
    "this increases to 20 - 50 myr for sun - like stars , consistent with estimates from hf / w isotopic measurements ( e.g. , jacobsen 2005 ) .",
    "the reason for the speedup in accretion times in the hzs of low - mass stars is due to a combination of the faster orbital speeds in the hzs of low - mass stars and the higher surface densities ( albeit much lower total hz masses ) .",
    "for instance , if we assume @xmath84 ( a rough fit to hillenbrand & white 2004 ) , then the location of the hz , @xmath85 , scales with the stellar mass as @xmath86 .",
    "the orbital speed in the hz , @xmath87 , scales as @xmath88 .",
    "the surface density in the hz , @xmath89 , scales as @xmath90 for our case of @xmath91 .",
    "so , using a very rough approximation that the growth time @xmath92 scales inversely with the product of the orbital frequency ( @xmath93 ) and the local surface density ( safronov 1969 ) yields @xmath94 for our case .",
    "this scaling is a very poor match to our simulations , yielding accretion timescales that are far too short for stellar masses below @xmath57 ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] ) .",
    "this is because the final stage of planetary growth is dominated by isolated scattering events between embryos rather than accretion from a continuous medium of planetesimals .",
    "in fact , we notice that a slightly different scaling , with @xmath95 , provides a good empirical fit to our simulated formation times ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] ) .",
    "we suspect that this is simply because of the dynamics of this accretion regime , in which the relevant bodies are not on initially crossing orbits , and secular perturbations are required to excite eccentricities and thus to cause orbits to cross .",
    "lissauer ( 2007 ) argued that the formation time of hz planets around low - mass stars is very short , a few hundred thousand years for a 1/3 @xmath5 star .",
    "our simulations confirm the trend that hz planets form faster around low - mass stars",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] shows that these formation times do not scale nearly as strongly with stellar mass as indicated by lissauer ( he calculated @xmath96 ) .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that lissauer required an earth - mass planet to form in the hz , so to accomplish this he increased the disk mass by a large factor .",
    "our models suggest that a factor of 20 - 30 increase is needed to form a 1 @xmath7 planet in the hz of a @xmath97 star ; as expected , that factor corresponds to the approximate difference in accretion times between our simulations and lissauer s .",
    "however , the fraction of 1/3 @xmath5 stars with disks massive enough to form a 1 @xmath7 planet in the hz is less than 5% , although that fraction increases to about 15% if @xmath98 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : frac ] below ) .",
    "in addition , recall that the much shallower empirical scaling ( @xmath99 for our case ) provides a far better fit to our simulations than the simple derivation using the orbital frequency ( @xmath94 for our case ; based on safronov 1969 and calculated in similar fashion to lissauer 2007 ) .",
    "the mean water content of our hz planets decreases drastically around low - mass stars .",
    "in fact , only one out of 19 hz planets formed from a star with @xmath100 contained a significant amount of water , compared with two out of six hz planets for @xmath101 and two out of four for @xmath102 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mall ] ) .",
    "the reason for this trend  drier planets in the hzs of lower - mass stars  is inefficient dynamical stirring in the low - mass disks found around low - mass stars , because more massive embryos are needed to increase eccentricities enough for significant radial mixing and therefore water delivery ( morbidelli 2000 ; raymond 2004 , 2007 ) .",
    "lissauer ( 2007 ) argued that planets in the hzs of m stars would be deficient in volatiles for three reasons : 1 ) collision velocities are higher ; 2 ) formation timescales are faster ; and 3 ) pre - main sequence evolution of the lowest - mass m stars is slow , such that the snow line and hz move inward on a myr to gyr timescale ( see kennedy 2006 ) .",
    "we agree with point 1 : collision velocities are proportional to the orbital speed , so the velocity of impactors at infinity ( neglecting the escape speed ) scales with stellar mass roughly as @xmath103 ( see above ) .",
    "we also agree qualitatively with point 2 : formation timescales are indeed likely to be shorter around low - mass stars by perhaps an order of magnitude compared with solar - mass stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] ) .",
    "point 3 is more uncertain : the inward movement of the snow line could affect the water contents of hz planets if the formation timescale is shorter than the snow line s drift timescale . in such a case , material in a given region may be too hot to contain water at early times , during accretion .",
    "after several myr , that zone may drop below the threshold for water to condense .",
    "if , however , the planets are fully formed by this time , then water delivery is impossible .",
    "note that this pre - main sequence scenario applies only to very low - mass stars .",
    "our results suggest that this is a moot point , as hz planets around such very low - mass stars are unlikely to have wide enough feeding zones to accrete water - bearing material , even at late times .",
    "thus , we argue that terrestrial planets in the hzs of low - mass stars are likely to be dry , but for a different reason than lissauer",
    ". simply put , very little water - rich material is likely to impact such planets at all , because radial mixing is inefficient in low - mass disks preferentially found around low - mass stars .",
    "the influence of additional gas or ice giant planets in the system is not expected to increase the water contents of hz planets , at least not from the asteroidal source of water considered here ( s. raymond 2007 , in preparation ) . however , migrating giant planets ( not modeled here ) can stir up eccentricities and induce the formation of very water - rich planets in their wake ( raymond 2006b ; fogg & nelson 2007 ; mandell 2007 ) .",
    "in addition , subsequent delivery of water from a cometary source is possible .",
    "an obvious criticism of this work is the lack of giant planets .",
    "simulations have shown that giant planets play an important role in terrestrial planet formation ( e.g. , wetherill 1996 ; levison & agnor 2003 ) .",
    "giant planets on orbits exterior to the terrestrial region , such as jupiter and saturn , stir up the eccentricities of embryos from the outside in via secular and resonant perturbations , while mutual scattering of embryos excites eccentricities from the inside out ( e.g. , raymond 2005b ) .",
    "accretion is suppressed in the vicinity of the giant planet , because perturbations between embryos during their growth can scatter them into unstable regions such as strong giant planet resonances ( wetherill 1994 ) .",
    "indeed , the combined effects of embryo scattering and perturbations from jupiter and saturn are thought to be the cause of the depletion of the solar system s asteroid belt ( wetherill 1992 ; chambers & wetherill 2001 ; petit 2001 ) .",
    "the net effect of giant planets is to increase the eccentricities of embryos during accretion .",
    "this can cause the width of the feeding zone of terrestrial planets to be increased , causing planets to be somewhat more massive and less numerous than in the absence of giant planets ( levison & agnor 2003 ) .",
    "this increase in planet mass can be as high as @xmath104 ( or planet masses can be decreased ) , but occurs primarily for relatively weak perturbations , i.e. , for less massive giant planets on relatively circular orbits ( s. raymond 2007 , in preparation ) . even on circular orbits ,",
    "external giant planets rarely enhance water delivery .",
    "rather , their perturbations clear out external , water - rich material leaving behind relatively dry terrestrial planets ( s. raymond 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "indeed , terrestrial planets in systems with giant planets on eccentric orbits are likely to be dry ( chambers & cassen 2002 ; raymond 2004 ; raymond 2006 ) . note that systems with close - in giant planets may also contain earth - like planets , which should be very water - rich ( raymond 2006b ; mandell 2007 ) .    to test the effects of giant planets",
    ", we performed eight additional simulations including one giant planet on an exterior orbit .",
    "we chose the 0.6 @xmath5 case for these simulations , to see if giant planet perturbations could increase the mean terrestrial planet mass above @xmath105 .",
    "we used the same four sets of embryos described in table 1 and included a giant planet on a circular orbit at 1.3 au , corresponding roughly to the orbital distance with the same temperature ( and therefore at a comparable dynamical separation from the hz ) as jupiter for a 0.6 @xmath5 star .",
    "we ran two sets of simulations , one each for a neptune- and a jupiter - mass giant planet .",
    "planets that formed in the hz of our 0.6 @xmath5 simulations without giant planets had masses between 0.06 and 0.18 @xmath7 , with a mean of 0.10 @xmath7 .",
    "systems with a jupiter- [ or neptune- ] mass giant planet formed , respectively , hz planets with masses between 0.05 [ 0.06 ] and 0.22 [ 0.10 ] @xmath7 , with a mean of 0.11 [ 0.09 ] @xmath7 , very close to the no giant planets cases .",
    "none of the seven hz planets in systems with no giant planets contained any water - rich material .",
    "two out of eleven hz planets that formed in the eight giant planet systems contained a substantial amount of water . while this is only a small fraction of outcomes ,",
    "it does show that giant planet stirring can , in some cases , help in water delivery .",
    "however , in the vast majority of situations , giant planets either hinder or have no effect on water delivery ( s. raymond 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "the formation timescales of hz planets in giant planet simulations were comparable to , or even slightly longer than , those with no giant planets . in almost all cases , planets with or without giant planets reached 75% of their final masses within 10 - 20 myr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] ) .",
    "we suspect that the reason giant planets do not accelerate accretion in this case is because more radial mixing is happening , such that accretion is somewhat less confined to a given annular zone .",
    "this effect appears to be small , as less than 20% of planets in the giant planet simulations contain water .",
    "our analysis is based on three key assumptions : 1 ) terrestrial planets below a given mass are unlikely to sustain life on gyr timescales  following williams ( 1998 ) , we derive a limiting planet mass of roughly @xmath106 ; 2 ) a protoplanetary disk can be well described by just a few parameters ( see eq .",
    "1 ) : the radial surface density slope @xmath24 , the relative disk mass in solids @xmath80 , and the exponent characterizing the disk mass - stellar mass relationship , @xmath21 ; and 3 ) the typical planet mass in the habitable zone is proportional to the disk mass in that zone ( see eq . 2 and fig .  [",
    "fig : mpl ] ) .",
    "we performed a suite of twenty dynamical simulations of the late - stage growth of terrestrial planets that confirmed that this scaling does hold for a wide range of stellar masses .",
    "we assumed in our calculations that no giant planets were present .",
    "we tested that assumption for the 0.6 @xmath5 case and found that the effects of exterior giant planets do not increase the masses or decrease the formation times of terrestrial planets , at least for the cases considered here .",
    "starting from these assumptions , we explored the range of parameters that allow planets more massive than @xmath105 to form in the habitable zones ( hzs ) of their host stars .",
    "we found that any realistic combination of parameters led to a stellar mass - planet mass correlation such that hz planet masses decrease with decreasing stellar mass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mpl ] ) . for a given set of parameters ( @xmath24 , @xmath21,@xmath80 )",
    ", one can derive a stellar mass below which the probability of a habitable planet forming in a disk with those parameters decreases to zero ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mstar - h ] ) .",
    "for instance , for our fiducial parameters ( @xmath41 , @xmath43,@xmath107 , chosen so that the simulations produce a mean planet mass of 1 @xmath7 for a 1 @xmath5 star ) , this critical stellar mass is @xmath108 .",
    "this would mean that no m stars and few k stars should have sustainably habitable planets . however , there are some caveats to this approach . first , for main sequence stars , it is impossible to go back in time to learn the properties of their protoplanetary disks , most importantly @xmath2 and @xmath24 .",
    "second , for a given set of parameters , there still exists a range of potential outcomes because of the stochastic nature of the final stages of planetary growth ( e.g. , wetherill 1996 , raymond 2004 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : mall ] ) .",
    "third and most importantly , there is no universal set of parameters that applies for all disks . a given set of parameter values",
    ", corresponding to a specific disk or set of disks , has a corresponding planet mass distribution .",
    "for instance , the above - mentioned 0.7 @xmath5 limit decreases to @xmath109 for a more massive disk with @xmath110 , and would decrease farther still for @xmath111 or @xmath112 .",
    "thus , our approach is only viable in a statistical sense , by combining likely outcomes from a distribution of disks with varying properties .",
    "what are the values of the crucial parameters ?",
    "we expect @xmath21 and @xmath24 to be universal values characterizing the distributions of all disks , but @xmath2 and @xmath23 to vary from disk to disk . as discussed above ,",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in the value of @xmath21 , which controls the disk mass - stellar mass scaling .",
    "if @xmath21 were larger than 2 or smaller than 0.5 , we expect that the trend would be apparent in fig . 3 in scholz ( 2006 ) .",
    "thus , a roughly linear disk mass - stellar mass relationship ( @xmath41 ) seems likely .",
    "a range of roughly 2 orders of magnitude in disk mass is observed around a given stellar mass ( e.g. , eisner & carpenter 2003 ; williams 2005 ; scholz 2006 ) , implying a corresponding range in @xmath2 values .",
    "note , however , that there exists a large uncertainty in tying a given @xmath2 value to an absolute disk mass or surface density , because of both observational and theoretical uncertainties ( e.g. , carpenter 2005 ) .",
    "there exists a range of 3 - 5 in metallicity @xmath23 for thin - disk stars ( nordstrom 2004 ) , although the range for currently - forming stars may be much smaller , only @xmath4920% ( see cartledge et al .",
    "nearly all disk models and observations suggest that the surface density exponent @xmath113 ( e.g. , dullemond 2007 ; andrews & williams 2006 ) . our choice of @xmath114 as a fiducial case was a compromise between these varying estimates .    given the large amount of intrinsic variation in the disk mass and accretion outcome , as well as the uncertainty in @xmath21 and @xmath24 , we do not consider any stellar mass limits from fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar - h ] to be firm .",
    "rather , our primary result is a statistical observation that , in our framework , the fraction of disks capable of forming planets of a given mass in the habitable zone decreases around low - mass stars .",
    "we investigate a model with @xmath80 distributed as a gaussian in log space , with a mean of @xmath42 and a standard deviation of 0.5 dex .",
    "for simplicity , all other parameters are held fixed , with @xmath43 , and @xmath21=1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : frac ] shows that the fraction of systems that can form a @xmath77 hz planet decreases from 80% around solar - type stars to 42% around 0.7 @xmath32 stars to 6% around 0.4 @xmath32 stars to only 0.3% around 0.2 @xmath32 stars .",
    "disks with more centrally concentrated mass distributions ( larger @xmath24 values ) have less difficulty forming massive planets in hzs very close to low - mass stars ( e.g. , raymond 2005b ) . for our chosen fiducial parameters , we estimate that only 25% of systems with @xmath115 can form planets @xmath83 , and only about 5% for @xmath116 . disks with radial surface density profiles as flat as @xmath117 have near zero probability for stars with @xmath118 , while probabilities are 2 - 4 times larger for disks with @xmath119 profiles .",
    "reducing the required planetary mass for habitability to @xmath120 increases the probability by a factor of 2 - 4 ( see below ) .",
    "our estimate of the minimum planet mass that can sustain enough tectonic activity for a period of time that we took as 5 gyr is also very uncertain .",
    "it is simple to show that if the mass luminosity relation is of the form @xmath121 , then the derived critical stellar mass @xmath122 below which there should be few planets with masses above a critical mass @xmath123 is given by @xmath124 , with @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "thus , a reduction in the adopted critical mass for sustained habitability from 0.3 to 0.2 @xmath7 reduces the required value of disk mass normalization by the same factor , in order to obtain the same critical stellar mass .",
    "alternatively , for a given chosen disk mass normalization , the derived @xmath122 varies with the assumed planet mass to a power that is between about 0.3 to 0.7 for most of the range of parameters described above .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : frac ] shows the effect of changing our @xmath105 lower limit , retaining fixed values of @xmath41 and @xmath27 .",
    "a system of three planets with minimum masses between 5 and 15 @xmath7 was recently discovered orbiting the 0.31 @xmath5 star gliese 581 ( bonfils 2005 ; udry 2007 ) . figures  [ fig : mstar - h ] and  [ fig : frac ] suggest that such a low - mass star is unlikely to form massive terrestrial planets .",
    "how can we reconcile this ?",
    "we see two possible explanations : 1 ) the planets of gl 581 formed _ in situ _ from a very massive disk , with @xmath126 ; or 2 ) our assumption of _ in situ _",
    "formation failed in this case : the planets of gl 581 formed farther from the star ( probably in the icy regions of a relatively massive disk , with @xmath127 of at least 5 - 10 ) and migrated inward ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) .",
    "if any of the gl 581 planets were to transit the parent star , then it would be possible to derive a rough composition ( rocky vs. icy : valencia 2007 ; fortney 2007 ; sotin 2007 ) , and to distinguish between these two formation scenarios ( gaidos 2007 ; s. raymond 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "note that , even if the gl 581 planets formed _ in situ _ , we expect that they would contain a substantial amount of water .",
    "following the arguments made above , massive disks promote eccentricity growth and radial mixing such that planets in the hz should accrete a large amount of water - rich material .",
    "even if hz planets of sufficient mass can form around m stars , they face other challenges , including loss of atmosphere by intense stellar activity coupled with their small distance to their parent stars , depending on the strength of the planetary magnetic field ( lammer 2007 ) , a snow line that takes perhaps a gyr to get close enough to the hz to give sufficient water ( kennedy 2006 ) , or loss of volatiles due to larger impact speeds and faster formation times ( lissauer 2007 ; but see  3.2 and fig .",
    "[ fig : tf ] ) .",
    "however these latter two points should not affect decisions concerning m star planet searches , since they only apply to the very lowest - mass stars , @xmath128 , whose apparent brightness and hz angular separation are far too small for any planned search ( scalo 2007 ) .",
    "unless the masses of disks are larger than is currently thought by a significant factor and/or the critical planet mass for habitability is considerably smaller , only a small fraction of accessible m star systems ( with @xmath129 ) should have habitable planets that remain habitable for billions of years .",
