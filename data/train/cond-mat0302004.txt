    "at sufficiently low electron densities , two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems become strongly correlated , because the kinetic energy is overpowered by energy of electron - electron interactions .",
    "the strength of the interactions is usually characterized by the ratio between the coulomb energy and the fermi energy , @xmath3 , which , assuming that the effective electron mass is equal to the band mass , in the systems with single - valley spectrum reduces to the wigner - seitz radius , @xmath4 ( here @xmath5 is the electron density and @xmath6 is the bohr radius in semiconductor ) .",
    "there are several suggested candidates for the ground state of the system , for example , ( i )  wigner crystal characterized by spatial and spin ordering @xcite , ( ii )  ferromagnetic fermi liquid with spontaneous spin ordering @xcite , and ( iii )  paramagnetic fermi liquid @xcite . in the strongly - interacting limit ( @xmath7 ) , no analytical theory has been developed to date . according to numeric simulations @xcite , wigner crystallization",
    "is expected in a very dilute regime , when @xmath8 reaches approximately 35 .",
    "the refined numeric simulations @xcite have predicted that prior to the crystallization , in the range of the interaction parameter @xmath9 , the ground state of the system is a strongly correlated ferromagnetic fermi liquid .",
    "a paramagnetic fermi liquid is realized at yet higher electron densities when the interactions are relatively weak ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the effective mass , @xmath0 , and land @xmath1 factor within the fermi liquid theory are renormalized due to spin exchange effects , with renormalization of the @xmath1 factor being dominant compared to that of the effective mass @xcite . alternatively , near the onset of wigner crystallization , strong increase of the effective mass is expected @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in the electron properties of dilute 2d systems due to the observation of an unexpected metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in zero magnetic field , strong metallic temperature dependence of the resistance in these systems , and a giant positive magnetoresistance in a magnetic field parallel to the 2d plane ( for a review , see ref .",
    "the most pronounced effects have been observed in high - mobility silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) , with the low - temperature drop of the resistance reaching an order of magnitude and magnetoresistance exceeding five orders of magnitude .",
    "significant progress has been recently made in understanding the metallic behaviour of the resistivity and its suppression by a magnetic field @xcite ; the metal - insulator transition , however , still lacks adequate theoretical description .    in this paper , which summarizes results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , we report measurements of the effective mass , @xmath0 , and land @xmath1 factor in a wide range of electron densities including the immediate vicinity of the mit . we have used two independent methods to determine these parameters . in the first method , we have studied low - temperature magnetotransport in a parallel magnetic field .",
    "it turns out that the magnetic field , @xmath11 , required to fully polarize electron spins , is a strictly linear function of the electron density : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is some finite electron density close to the critical electron density @xmath14 for the @xmath15 metal - insulator transition .",
    "vanishing @xmath11 points to a sharply increasing spin susceptibility , @xmath2 , and gives evidence in favour of the spontaneous spin polarization at a finite electron density .",
    "( similar conclusion about possible spontaneous spin polarization in the dilute 2d electron system in silicon has been reached in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) comparing our data for zero - field resistivity with the recent theory @xcite , we extract the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 separately .",
    "it turns out that it is the value of the effective mass that becomes strongly ( by more than a factor of 3 ) enhanced with decreasing electron density , while the @xmath1 factor remains nearly constant and close to its value in bulk silicon . in the second method",
    ", we have determined the effective mass by analyzing temperature dependence of the weak - field shubnikov - de  haas ( sdh ) oscillations and found good agreement with the data obtained by the first method . furthermore , using tilted magnetic fields , we find that the value of the effective mass does not depend on the degree of spin polarization , which points to a _ spin - independent _ origin of the effective mass enhancement .",
    "this is in clear contradiction with existing theories @xcite .",
    "measurements have been made in a rotator - equipped oxford dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of @xmath16  mk on low - disordered ( 100)-silicon samples similar to those previously used in ref .",
    "peak electron mobilities in these samples are close to 3  m@xmath17/vs at 0.1  k. to minimize the contact resistance , which tends to grow very high at mk temperatures and low electron density , thin gaps in the gate metallization have been introduced ; this allows for maintaining high electron density near the contacts ( about @xmath18  @xmath19 ) regardless of its value in the main part of the sample .",
    "these gaps are narrow enough ( @xmath20  nm ) for the given gate - oxide thickness to provide a smoothly descending electrostatic potential from the high - density part to the low - density part .",
    "the resistance , @xmath21 , has been measured by a standard 4-terminal technique at a low frequency ( 0.4  hz ) to minimize the out - of - phase signal .",
    "excitation current has been kept low ( 0.1 - 0.2  na ) to ensure that measurements are taken in the linear regime of response ; the power generated in the samples has been maintained under @xmath22  w. to verify that the electrons are not overheated , we have studied the temperature dependence of the amplitude of the sdh oscillations ; the latter has been found to follow the theoretical curve down to temperatures less than 50  mk ( for more on this , see below ) .",
    "we start by showing a low - temperature longitudinal magnetoresistance @xmath21 in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath23 for a relatively high ( fig .  [ 1](a ) ) and relatively low ( fig .  [ 1](b ) ) electron densities . at the high density ,",
    "positions of sdh oscillations correspond to `` cyclotron '' filling factors @xcite , some of which are marked by arrows .",
    "indeed , the energy splittings @xmath24 at `` spin '' filling factors , @xmath25  2 , 6 , 10 ...",
    "@xmath26 , in high - density si mosfets are known to be much smaller than the splittings @xmath27 at `` cyclotron '' filling factors , @xmath25  4 , 8 , 12 ...",
    "@xmath28 , disregarding the odd @xmath29 valley splitting which is small ( here @xmath30 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath31  1 , 2 , 3 ... ) .",
    "the behaviour of the sample at a relatively high electron density is thus rather ordinary .",
    "in contrast , at low electron density ( just above the metal - insulator transition which in this sample occurs at @xmath32  @xmath19 ) , the magnetoresistance looks quite different @xcite .",
    "the resistance minima are seen only at @xmath25  2 , 6 , and 10 ( see the inset ) ; there is also a minimum at @xmath33 ( not shown in the figure ) corresponding to the valley splitting .",
    "there are neither dips nor other anomalies at magnetic fields corresponding to @xmath25  4 , 8 , or 12 where cyclotron minima are expected .",
    "figure  [ 2 ] shows how the resistance minima corresponding to the cyclotron splittings gradually disappear as the electron density is reduced . at the highest electron densities ( the lower curves ) , deep resistance minima near even filling factors",
    "are seen ( @xmath25  4 , 6 , and 8 in fig .  [ 2](a ) ; @xmath25  10 , 12 , and 16 in fig .",
    "[ 2](b ) ) , and a shallow minimum is visible at @xmath34 in fig .  [",
    "as @xmath5 is reduced , the minima at @xmath25  4 , 8 , 12 , and 16 become less deep , and at the lowest electron densities ( the upper curves ) , neither of them is seen any longer , and only minima at @xmath25  6 , 10 , and 14 remain .",
    "our results thus show that as one approaches the metal - insulator transition , the energy gaps at `` cyclotron '' filling factors become gradually smaller than those at `` spin '' filling factors and eventually vanish .",
    "the condition for vanishing @xmath35 is @xmath36 ( within the uncertainty associated with the broadening of the energy levels ) , or @xmath37 , which is higher by more than a factor of five than the `` normal '' value of this ratio , @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the spin susceptibility @xmath2 is strongly enhanced near the mit .",
    "one could attempt to link the observed behaviour to a many - body enhancement of spin gaps specific for a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the disappearance of the cyclotron splittings in a wide range of magnetic fields would require an enhanced @xmath1-factor which is independent of magnetic field , in contradiction with ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are consistent with the suggestion @xcite that the effective @xmath1 factor is nearly field - independent and approximately equal to its many - body enhanced zero - field value .",
    "to probe this conjecture , we have studied the _ parallel - field _ magnetotransport in a wide range of electron densities .",
    "typical curves of the low - temperature magnetoresistance @xmath39 in a parallel magnetic field are displayed in fig .",
    "note that the thickness of the 2d electron system in si mosfets is small compared to the magnetic length in accessible fields , and , therefore , the parallel field couples largely to the electrons spins while the orbital effects are suppressed @xcite",
    ". the resistivity increases with field until it saturates at a constant value above a certain density - dependent magnetic field . according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the saturation of the magnetoresistance indicates the onset of a complete spin polarization . in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition ,",
    "the magnetoresistance is strongly @xmath40-dependent down to the lowest achievable temperatures .",
    "as one moves away from the transition , however , the temperature dependences saturate at very low temperatures .",
    "the data shown below are obtained in this low - temperature limit where the magnetoresistance becomes temperature - independent .    in fig .  [ 4 ] , we show how the normalized magnetoresistance , measured at different electron densities , collapses onto a single curve when plotted as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "the scaling parameter , @xmath11 , has been normalized to correspond to the magnetic field at which the magnetoresistance saturates ( within the accuracy with which the latter can be determined ) .",
    "the observed scaling is remarkably good for @xmath42 in the electron density range @xmath43  @xmath19 , although with increasing @xmath5 , the scaled experimental data occupy progressively shorter intervals on the resulting curve .",
    "both at @xmath44 and outside the indicated range of electron densities , the scaled data start to noticeably deviate from the universal curve . in particular , the scaling breaks down when one approaches ( @xmath45 ) the metal - insulator transition which in this sample occurs at zero magnetic field at @xmath46  @xmath19 .",
    "this is not surprising as the magnetoresistance near @xmath14 depends strongly on temperature , as discussed above .",
    "we note that the observed scaling dependence is described reasonably well by the theoretical dependence of @xmath47 on the degree of spin polarization @xmath48 predicted by the recent theory @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ 5 ] , @xmath11 is plotted vs.  @xmath5 . with high accuracy , @xmath11 is proportional to the deviation of the electron density from its critical value , _ i.e. _ , to @xmath49 , over a wide range of electron densities .",
    "in other words , the field , at which the magnetoresistance saturates , tends to vanish at @xmath14 ( see also refs .",
    "we emphasize that our procedure provides high accuracy for determining the behaviour of the field of saturation with electron density , _",
    "i.e. _ , the functional form of @xmath50 , even though the absolute value of @xmath11 is determined not so accurately . note that at @xmath5 above @xmath51  @xmath19 , the saturation of the resistance is not reached in our magnetic field range ; still , the high precision of the collapse of the high - density experimental curves onto the same scaling curve as the low - density data allows us to draw conclusions about the validity of the obtained law @xmath50 over a much wider range of electron densities .",
    "the observed tendency of @xmath11 to vanish at a finite electron density is consistent with the strong increase of the spin susceptibility @xmath2 @xcite and gives evidence in favour of a spontaneous spin polarization at @xmath52 . in principle",
    ", either @xmath1 or @xmath0 ( or both ) may be responsible for the strong increase of the spin susceptibility . as has already been mentioned , within the fermi liquid theory , both the effective mass and @xmath1 factor are renormalized due to spin exchange effects , with renormalization of the @xmath1 factor being dominant compared to that of the effective mass .",
    "in contrast , the dominant increase of the effective mass follows from an alternative description of the strongly - interacting electron system beyond the fermi liquid approach @xcite . to separate @xmath1 and @xmath0 ,",
    "we have measured the temperature - dependent conductivity in zero magnetic field and analyzed the data in the spirit of recent theory @xcite . according to this theory , @xmath53 is a linear function of temperature :    @xmath54    where the slope , @xmath55 , is determined by the interaction - related parameters : the fermi liquid constants , @xmath56 and @xmath57 :    @xmath58    the factor @xmath59 is equal to 8 in our case @xcite .",
    "this theoretical relation allows us to determine the many - body enhanced @xmath1 factor and mass @xmath0 separately using the data for the slope @xmath55 and the product @xmath60 .",
    "typical dependences of the normalized conductivity on temperature , @xmath61 , are displayed in fig .  [ 6 ] at different electron densities above @xmath14 ; the value @xmath62 , which has been used to normalize @xmath53 , was obtained by extrapolating the linear interval of the @xmath63 dependence to @xmath64 .",
    "as long as the deviation @xmath65 is sufficiently small , the conductivity @xmath53 increases linearly with decreasing @xmath40 in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) , until it saturates at the lowest temperatures .",
    "as seen from the figure , the linear interval of the dependence is wide enough to make a reliable fit .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of the inverse slope @xmath66 , extracted from the @xmath63 data , is shown in the inset to fig .  [ 5 ] by open circles . over a wide range of electron densities ,",
    "the values @xmath66 and @xmath67 turn out to be close to each other .",
    "the low - density data for @xmath66 are approximated well by a linear dependence which extrapolates to the critical electron density @xmath14 in a similar way to the behaviour of the polarization field @xmath11 .    in fig .  [ 7 ] , we show the so - determined values @xmath68 and @xmath69 as a function of the electron density ( here @xmath70 is the @xmath1 factor in bulk silicon , @xmath71 is the band mass equal to @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the free electron mass ) . in the high @xmath5 region ( relatively weak interactions ) , the enhancement of both @xmath1 and @xmath0 is relatively small , both values slightly increasing with decreasing electron density in agreement with earlier data @xcite . also , the renormalization of the @xmath1 factor is dominant compared to that of the effective mass , which is consistent with theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the renormalization at low @xmath5 ( near the critical region ) , where @xmath7 , is much more striking . as the electron density is decreased , the renormalization of the effective mass overshoots abruptly while that of the @xmath1 factor remains relatively small , @xmath74 , without tending to increase .",
    "hence , the current analysis indicates that it is the effective mass , rather than the @xmath1 factor , that is responsible for the drastically enhanced @xmath60 value near the metal - insulator transition .",
    "since the procedure for extracting @xmath1 and @xmath0 described above relies on theoretically calculated functional form for the slope @xmath55 @xcite , we have performed independent measurements of the effective mass based on the temperature analysis of the amplitude , @xmath75 , of the weak - field ( sinusoidal ) sdh oscillations . a typical temperature dependence of @xmath75 for the normalized resistance , @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the average resistance ) , is displayed in fig .  [ 8 ] .",
    "to determine the effective mass , we use the method of ref .",
    "@xcite extending it to much lower electron densities and temperatures .",
    "we fit the data for @xmath78 using the formula    @xmath79    [ a ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the dingle temperature .",
    "as the latter is related to the level width through the expression @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 is the elastic scattering time ) @xcite , damping of the sdh oscillations with temperature may be influenced by temperature - dependent @xmath83 .",
    "we have verified that in the studied low - temperature limit for electron densities down to @xmath84  @xmath19 , possible corrections to the mass value caused by the temperature dependence of @xmath83 ( and hence @xmath81 ) are within our experimental uncertainty which is estimated at about 10% .",
    "note that the amplitude of the sdh oscillations follows the calculated curve down to the lowest achieved temperatures , which confirms that the electrons were in a good thermal contact with the bath and were not overheated .",
    "the fact that the experimental dependence @xmath78 follows the theoretical curve justify applicability of eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) to this strongly - interacting electron system .",
    "the so - determined effective mass is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ 7 ] . in quantitative agreement with the results obtained by the alternative method described above ( the dotted line ) ,",
    "the effective mass sharply increases with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "the agreement between the results obtained by two independent methods adds confidence in our results and conclusions .",
    "our data are also consistent with the data for spin and cyclotron gaps obtained by magnetocapacitance spectroscopy @xcite",
    ".    a strong enhancement of @xmath0 at low electron densities may originate from spin effects @xcite . with the aim of probing a possible contribution from the spin effects ,",
    "we have introduced a parallel magnetic field component to align the electrons spins . in fig .  [",
    "9 ] , we show the behaviour of the effective mass with the degree of spin polarization , @xmath85 .",
    "as seen from the figure , within our accuracy , the _ effective mass @xmath0 does not depend on @xmath86_. therefore , the @xmath87 dependence is robust , the origin of the mass enhancement has no relation to the electrons spins and exchange effects @xcite .",
    "under the conditions of our experiments , the interaction parameter , @xmath8 , is larger by a factor of @xmath88 than the wigner - seitz radius and reaches approximately 50 , which is above the theoretical estimate for the onset of wigner crystallization . as has already been mentioned , two approaches to calculate the renormalization of @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "have been formulated .",
    "the first one exploits the fermi liquid model extending it to relatively large @xmath8 .",
    "its main outcome is that the renormalization of @xmath1 is large compared to that of @xmath0 @xcite . in the limiting case of high @xmath8",
    ", one may expect a divergence of the @xmath1 factor that corresponds to the stoner instability .",
    "these predictions are in obvious contradiction to our data : ( i ) the behaviour of the 2d dilute system in the regime of the strongly enhanced susceptibility  close to the onset of spontaneous spin polarization and wigner crystallization  is governed by the effective mass , rather than the @xmath1 factor , through the interaction parameter @xmath8 ; and ( ii ) the insensitivity of the effective mass to spin effects also can not be accounted for .",
    "the other theoretical approach either employs analogy between a strongly interacting 2d electron system and he@xmath89 @xcite or applies gutzwiller s variational method @xcite to si mosfets @xcite .",
    "it predicts that near the crystallization point , the renormalization of @xmath0 is dominant compared to that of @xmath1 and that the effective mass tends to diverge at the transition .",
    "although the sharp increase of the mass is in agreement with our findings , it is the expected dependence of @xmath0 on the degree of spin polarization that is not confirmed by our data : the model of ref .",
    "@xcite predicts that the effective mass should increase with increasing spin polarization , whereas the prediction of the other model @xcite is the opposite .",
    "thus , the existing theories fail to explain our finding that in a dilute 2d electron system the effective mass is strongly enhanced and does not depend on the degree of spin polarization .",
    "the fact that the spin exchange is not responsible for the observed mass enhancement reduces the chances for the occurrence of the ferromagnetic fermi liquid prior to the wigner crystallization .",
    "however , should the spin exchange be small , the spin effects may still come into play closer to the onset of wigner crystallization where the fermi energy may continue dropping as caused by mass enhancement .    in summary",
    ", we have found that in very dilute two - dimensional electron systems in silicon , the effective mass sharply increases with decreasing electron density , while the @xmath1 factor remains nearly constant and close to its value in bulk silicon .",
    "the enhanced effective mass does not depend on the degree of the spin polarization and , therefore , its increase is not related to spin exchange effects , in contradiction with existing theories .",
    "the corresponding strong rise of the spin susceptibility may be a precursor of a spontaneous spin polarization ; unlike in the stoner scenario , the latter originates from the enhancement of the effective mass rather than the increase of the @xmath1 factor .",
    "our results show that the dilute 2d electron system in silicon behaves well beyond the weakly interacting fermi liquid .",

    "<S> we have measured the effective mass , @xmath0 , and land @xmath1 factor in very dilute two - dimensional electron systems in silicon . </S>",
    "<S> two independent methods have been used : ( i )  measurements of the magnetic field required to fully polarize the electrons spins and ( ii )  analysis of the shubnikov - de  haas oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed a _ sharp increase of the effective mass _ with decreasing electron density while the @xmath1 factor remains nearly constant and close to its value in bulk silicon . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding strong rise of the spin susceptibility @xmath2 may be a precursor of a spontaneous spin polarization ; unlike in the stoner scenario , it originates from the enhancement of the effective mass rather than from the increase of @xmath1 factor . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , using tilted magnetic fields , we have found that the enhanced effective mass is independent of the degree of spin polarization and , therefore , its increase is not related to spin exchange effects , in contradiction with existing theories . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the dilute 2d electron system in silicon behaves well beyond a weakly interacting fermi liquid . </S>"
