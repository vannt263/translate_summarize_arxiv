    "iterated games have long been exemplary models for the emergence of cooperations in socioeconomic and biological systems @xcite . learned from these studies , the most significant lesson is that in the long term , selfish behavior will hurt you as much as your opponents .",
    "therefore , from both scientific and moral perspectives , ants and us all live in a reassuring world : altruists will eventually dominate a reasonable population .",
    "very recently , however , press and dyson @xcite have shattered this well - accepted scenario by introducing a new class of probabilistic memory - one strategies for the two - player iterated prisoner s dilemma ( ipd ) , so - called zero - determinant ( zd ) strategies . via zd strategies ,",
    "a player can unilaterally pin his opponents expected payoff or extort his opponents by enforcing a linear relationship between his own payoff and the opponents payoff . in a word",
    ", egotists could become more powerful and harmful if they know mathematics . though being challenged by the evolutionary stability @xcite , studies on zd strategies as a whole @xcite will dramatically change our understanding on iterated games @xcite .",
    "indeed , knowing the existence of zd strategies has already changed the game .",
    "zd strategies in ipd can be naturally extended to other iterated two - player games @xcite , which are still uncultivated lands for scientists .",
    "instead , we turn our attention to the iterated multi - player games and try to answer a blazing question : could a single zd player in a group of considerable number of players unilaterally pin the expected total payoff of all other players and extort them ? this paper focuses on a notable representative of multi - player games , the public goods game ( pgg ) @xcite . in the simplest @xmath0-player pgg , each player chooses whether or not contribute a unit of cost into a public pot .",
    "the total contribution in the public pot will be multiplied by a factor @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and then be evenly divided among all @xmath0 players , regardless whether they have contributed or not . as a simple but rich model ,",
    "the pgg arises a question why and when a player is willing to contribute against the obvious nash equilibrium at zero @xcite , which is critical for the understanding , predicting and intervening of many important issues ranging from micro - organism behaviors @xcite to global warming @xcite . among a couple of candidates",
    "@xcite , the repeated interactions may be a relevant mechanism to the above question , since reputation , trustiness , reward and punishment can then play a role @xcite .",
    "we thus study the iterated public goods game ( ipgg , also named as repeated public goods game in the literatures ) where the same players in a group play a series of stage games .",
    "it is found by surprise that the zd strategies still exist for a group with many players in ipgg , namely a single player can pin the total payoff of all others or extort them in a unilateral way .",
    "however , different from the observations in ipd , there exists some unreported restrictive conditions related to the group size and multiplication factor , which determine the feasibility to pin the total payoff of all other players and the upper bound of extortionate ratio .",
    "consider an @xmath0-player iterated game , which consists of a series of repetitions of a same stage game of @xmath0 players .",
    "press and dyson @xcite proved the theorem that , in such an iterated game , if the stage games are identically repeated infinite times , a long - memory player will have no advantage over a short - memory player . without loss of generality ,",
    "it is suffice to derive players strategy assuming they have only memory - one .",
    "thus , which action a player will take in the current round depends on the outcome of the previous round . for an arbitrary player @xmath3 , a ( mixed ) strategy",
    "@xmath4 is a vector that consists of conditional probabilities for cooperating with respect to every possible outcome .",
    "since we consider a general @xmath0-player game and every player may choose cooperation ( @xmath5 ) or defection ( @xmath6 ) , there are @xmath7 possible outcomes for each round . for player @xmath8 , his memory - one strategy",
    "can be represented by a @xmath7-dimensional vector : @xmath9^{t } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 stands for the conditional probability that @xmath8 will cooperate in the current round , given the outcome of the previous round . here",

    "figure 1 shows an example for an @xmath12 game , in which the players are @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the possible outcomes are @xmath15 .    in many multi - player games such as public goods game @xcite , n - player snowdrift game @xcite , n - player stag - hunt game @xcite and collective - risk social dilemma @xcite , whether a specific opponent chooses to cooperate is less meaningful , instead , it is crucial for a player to know how many his opponents cooperate . in such a scenario ,",
    "if a player @xmath8 s previous move is @xmath5 and the number of cooperators among the opponents in the previous round is , the probabilities for him to cooperate in the current round are denoted as @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , if his previous move is @xmath6 and the number of cooperating opponents is @xmath17 , the probability to cooperate is @xmath18 .",

    "starting at an initial outcome , the @xmath0 players strategy profile determines a stochastic process .",
    "since these are memory - one strategies , the corresponding stochastic process can be characterized by a markov chain .",
    "each possible outcome of the repeated games can be maintained by a state in this markov chain model . under this model ,",

    "indeed , compared with those well - known game strategies @xcite , the zd strategies are too complicated to be mastered by normal persons , who will eventually become exploitees in the present of zd players .    to explore the general applicability and limitations of zd strategies , we have taken a step from two - player games to multi - player games , with the iterated public goods game being the selected template .",
    "the bad news learned from our study is that a single zd player can unilaterally pin the total expected payoff of all other opponents and extort them by enforcing a linear relationship between his own payoff and the opponents total payoff .",
    "a good news from the results is that the capacity of a zd player to either pin or extort other opponents is more strictly limited compared with the two - player games . roughly speaking",
    ", we can suppress the influences of the zd player by increasing the number of participants and/or encouraging cooperation via enlarging the multiplication factor .",
    "taking the global warming problem as an example , if we have made more people being aware of the seriousness of such issue and understanding that the abandonment of some environmentally costly lifestyles is of great significance for the sustainable development , we can to some extent enlarge @xmath0 and @xmath1 and thus suppress zd players .",
    "another good point is that when there are more than one zd players in the ipgg , they can not collusively control others but each fights his own battle .    iterated games with private monitoring",
    "represent long - term relationships among players where each player privately receives a noisy ( imperfect ) observation of the opponents actions @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of handling such games comes from the fact that players do not share common information under private monitoring , and the decision making in such games involves with complicated statistic inference .",
    "consequently , the analysis , optimization , cooperation enforcement and control in such games have been known as long - standing challenges .",
    "this subclass of game theory has found a wide range of applications @xcite , such as evolution in a realistic noisy environment @xcite and agent planning under uncertainty @xcite .",
    "whether zd strategies still works in the noisy environments ?",
    "is it still possible for a crafty egoist to control the payoffs of his opponents ?",
    "these questions ask for future in - depth understanding of zd strategies .    both the origin of life and the formation of human societies require cooperation @xcite . during the history of biological evolution , animals and microorganisms such as vampire bats , three - spined sticklebacks , cleaner fishes and bacteria can recognize the importance of reciprocity and even cooperate according to tit - for - tat strategy @xcite .",
    "male side - blotched lizard and _ escherichia coli _ can play the rock - paper - scissors game in order to maintain biodiversity @xcite .",
    "human is the champion of cooperation . with the growth",
    ", children may change from selfishness to egalitarian @xcite .",
    "it is worth exploring whether we can find some field evidences that human beings and animals may be already aware of the existence of zd strategies during the biological evolution .",
    "researchers can also design laboratory experiments and study responses of human beings when facing zd strategies @xcite .",
    "a player may vary his strategy frequently that can not generate a markovian stationary state .",
    "therefore , there are some interesting problems such as whether some proper zd strategies can control opponents payoff in a short timescale and how a smart player alters his zd strategies in terms of his opponents responds . and of course",
    ", we firstly want to know whether a normal person will become crazy when facing a crafty zd player",
    ".    furthermore , for a large population , an individual can not interact with everybody else .",
    "some individuals usually interact more often than others .",
    "the spatial structures of population may affect the maintenance of cooperation .",
    "then some questions natural arise , for example , what is the relationship between the different population structures and related zd strategies and whether the cooperation can sustain in dynamic social network with the evolution of zd strategies @xcite .",
    "network analysis is then expected to plays a significant role @xcite .",
    "different from the prisoner s dilemma game which characterizes the pairwise interaction , the public goods game depicts the group interaction . in the pairwise prisoner s dilemma game , only two players take part in one game . if both of them are extortioners , their surpluses become zero that leads to the evolutionary instability of extortion strategies in an infinite population .",
    "however , for the public goods game , @xmath0 players participate in one game .",
    "it is difficult to ensure all players are aware of the existence of zd strategies and use the extortion strategies .",
    "hence , comparing with the pairwise prisoner s dilemma game , the situation for public goods game is more complicated when considering the evolutionary stability .",
    "it is relatively easy to analyze the evolutionary stability of zd versus special strategies , such as always cooperation , always defection , win - stay - lose - shift , and so on . since the strategy space of public goods game is very huge comparing with prisoner s dilemma game , we should carefully consider how to perform monte carlo simulations of population in the framework of weak mutation similar to ref .",
    "moreover , in this paper we only consider the extortion strategies .",
    "recently good strategies in ipd have been studied @xcite , which can to be extended to multi - player ipgg by replacing @xmath53 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : extortionate ] ) with @xmath182 .",
    "then the robustness of good and generosity strategies can be deeply analyzed in the next step .",
    "in addition , the evolutionary stability analysis of ipgg can also be combined with the studies on the effects of reward and punishment @xcite .",
    "the authors acknowledge the valuable suggestions and comments from guan - rong chen , petter holme , gang yan and qian zhao .",

    "a zd player @xmath8 can not unilaterally set his own payoff in the pd , here we obtain the same conclusion for iterated pgg .",
    "if he tries to set his own payoff , he must choose @xmath183 .",
    "the linear equations now become @xmath184 @xmath185 setting @xmath84 and @xmath85 as free variables , we have    [ eq : alphaes ] @xmath186    since @xmath187 are decreasing functions of @xmath17 , we have    [ eq : probconstrainself ] @xmath188    after some algebra , ( [ eq : probconstrainself2 ] ) can be reduced to @xmath189 since @xmath190 for pgg , this leads to @xmath191 .",
    "so a zd player @xmath8 can not set his own payoff .",
    "in the determinant form of player s payoff , there are columns which are controlled by more than one players .",
    "this suggests that there might be collusive strategies , which means more than one players trying to control other players payoff collusively .",
    "however this type of zd strategies generally does not exit .",
    "take the @xmath192player collusive strategies as an example .",
    "denote the column controlled tangly by the player @xmath8 and @xmath13 by @xmath193 .",
    "for general zd strategies @xmath194 , the following @xmath19 linear equations must be satisfied : @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 . here",
    "@xmath199,@xmath200,@xmath201 and @xmath202 depend on the specific values of @xmath203 and @xmath204 . from the above",
    "constrains , we obtain @xmath205 this is a very strong constraint , and generally can not be satisfied .",
