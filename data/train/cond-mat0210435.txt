    "there are many reasons for studying nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "let us start be mentioning a few which carry some generality .",
    "first and foremost , equilibrium in nature is more of an exception than the rule , and structural changes ( which constitute a significant portion of interesting phenomena ) usually take place in nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "thus there is much to be learned about the complex ordering phenomena occurring far from equilibrium .",
    "second , while very little is understood about the general aspects of nonequilibrium systems , the equilibrium critical phenomena have been much studied and have been shown to display universal features .",
    "this universality emerges from large - scale fluctuations in such a robust way that one can expect that similar mechanisms will work in nonequilibrium situations as well .",
    "thus , investigating the similarities and differences of equilibrium and nonequilibrium orderings may help to discover the distinguishing but still robust properties of nonequilibrium systems .",
    "third , power law correlations are present in many nonequilibrium phenomena and there have been many attempts to explain these correlations through general mechanisms .",
    "closer examination , however , usually reveals a close connection to equilibrium or nonequilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "my lectures were designed to revolve around problems related to the above points .",
    "the lectures are built on the theory of equilibrium phase transitions , thus i assume knowledge about both static and dynamic critical phenomena at least on the level of familiarity with the basic concepts ( symmetry breaking , order parameter , diverging correlation length , order parameter , scaling , universality classes , critical slowing down , dynamical symmetries ) .",
    "i discuss simple examples throughout so that enterprising students could try out their luck implementing their ideas in simple calculations .",
    "due to space restrictions , however , not all of the details discussed in the lectures and afterwards are covered in the written notes .",
    "in particular , the picturesque parts of the explanations are often left out since they take up disproportionally large part of the allowed space .",
    "nevertheless , these pictures may be important in both understanding and memorizing , and i strongly encourage the reader to go through the slides of the lectures , as well . they can be found through the homepage of the school , http://dpm.univ-lyon1.fr/houches_ete/lectures/ or at http://poe.elte.hu/@xmath0racz/.",
    "a general feature that distinguishes a nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) from an equilibrium one is the presence of fluxes of physical quantities such as energy , mass , charge , etc .",
    "thus the study of ness is , in a sense , a study of the effects of fluxes imposed on the system either by boundary conditions , or by bulk driving fields , or by some combination of them .",
    "a nonequilibrium steady stateswell known example is shown on fig.[fig : benard ] .",
    "this is the rayleigh - bnard experiment @xcite in which a horizontal layer of viscous fluid ( the system ) is heated from below i.e. it has two heat baths of temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 attached ( boundary conditions generating an energy flux ) .",
    "the presence of gravity ( the bulk drive ) is also important ( it generates mass and momentum fluxes at large @xmath3 ) .    for @xmath4",
    "this system relaxes into a quiescent equilibrium state while a small @xmath5 will also result in a quiescent state but it is already a ness since energy flux is flowing through the system . increasing @xmath5 ,",
    "this steady state displays a nonequilibrium phase transition ( rayleigh - bnard instability ) , first to a stationary convective pattern , and then to a series of more complicated structures which have fascinated researchers for the past century @xcite .    starting from the navier - stokes equations",
    ", one can arrive at a mean - field level of understanding of the above phenomena .",
    "it is , however , not the level of sophistication one got used to in connection with equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "there , we have simple exactly solvable models such as e.g. the ising model which give much insight into the mechanism of ordering and , furthermore , this insight can be used to develop theories which reveal the universal features of equilibrium orderings .",
    "the trouble with the rayleigh - bnard system is that we do not have a theory even for the ness .",
    "the reason for this is that the fluxes result in steady state distributions , @xmath6 , which break the detailed balance condition @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two `` microstates '' and @xmath10 is the rate of the @xmath11 transition . as a consequence of the breaking of detailed balance , a ness is characterized not only by the probability distribution , @xmath6 , but also by the probability currents in the phase space .",
    "unfortunately , we have not learned yet how to handle the presence of such loops of probability currents .",
    "the main lesson we should learn from the rayleigh - bnard example is that , in order to have ising type models for describing phase transitions in ness , one should use models which relax to steady states with fluxes present .",
    "such models have been developed during the last 20 years , and most of my lectures are about these stochastic models defined through `` microscopic '' elementary processes .",
    "the first level of description is in terms of master equations which are conceptually simple and allow one to make use of general results ( uniqueness of stationary state , etc . ) which in turn are helpful in defining dynamics that leads to ness ( sec.[ptffe ] ) .",
    "the next level is to describe the same problem in terms of langevin equations and develop field - theoretic techniques for the solution .",
    "our discussions will include both levels of description and i hope that at the end an understanding will emerge about a few results which grew in importance in the last decade ( generation of long - range interactions and effects of dynamical anisotropies ( sec.[ptffe ] ) , connection between mechanisms generating power - law correlations ( sec.[powlaw ] ) , and universality of distribution functions for macroscopic quantities ( sec.[noneqdist ] ) ) .    before starting , however",
    ", i would like to insert here a little essay about effective temperatures .",
    "this concept is being widely discussed in connection with slowly relaxing systems , the topic of this school .",
    "so it may be of interest to present here a view from the perspective of ness .",
    "systems close to equilibrium may retain many properties of an equilibrium state with the slight complication that the intensive thermodynamic variables ( temperature , chemical potential , etc . ) become inhomogeneous on long lengthscales and they may slowly vary in time .",
    "this type of situations are successfully dealt with using the so called local equilibrium approximation @xcite , with the name giving away the essence of the approximation .",
    "the applicability of the concept of local equilibrium should diminish , however , as a system is driven far from equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , questions of `` how large drive produces a far - enough state '' and `` could nt one try to find a new equilibrium state near - by '' are regularly asked and have legitimacy .",
    "so i will try to illuminate the problems on the example of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem much discussed nowadays due to attempts of associating effective temperatures with the various stages of relaxation in glasses @xcite or with steady states in granular materials @xcite .",
    "let us consider a simple system of ising variables @xmath12 with hamiltonian @xmath13 and in equilibrium at temperature @xmath14 .",
    "assuming that there is an external field @xmath15 coupling linearly to the macroscopic magnetization @xmath16 , one can write the equilibrium distribution function as @xmath17 the average value of the magnetization is given by @xmath18 and the static limit of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is obtained as @xmath19 where we assumed the system to be in the high - temperature phase ( @xmath20 ) . note the simplicity and the accompanying generality of this derivation .",
    "it uses only the fact that the external field is linearly coupled to the quantity ( @xmath21 ) we are considering .    the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is used in many ways .",
    "it helps simplify field - theoretic studies of fluctuations through diagrammatic expansions and it also gives a powerful checking procedure in both experiments and monte carlo simulations .",
    "note that eq.([eqsusc ] ) can also be used to define the temperature of the system through @xmath22 , and the temperature defined in this way would be the same when using different `` @xmath21''-s and conjugate fields `` @xmath15 '' .",
    "it is clear that a fluctuation - dissipation theorem generalized to ness would be extremely useful .",
    "let us now try to imagine how a similar relationship may arise when we drive the above system away from equilibrium ( e.g. by attaching two heat baths of different temperatures ) .",
    "if the system relaxes to a ness then there will be steady - state distribution function , ( @xmath23 ) but the effective hamiltonian ( @xmath24 ) will contain all the interactions allowed by the symmetries of the system .",
    "thus , assuming that the effective hamiltonian can be expanded in @xmath15 , one finds in the @xmath25 limit @xmath26 } \\ , \\label{nessdist}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a notation for sums over all three - spin clusters with different couplings for different types of spatial arrangements of the three spins .",
    "furthermore , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and all other newly generated couplings depend on the original couplings in @xmath13 and on the temperatures of the heat baths .",
    "now a derivation of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem similar to the equilibrium case yields a more complicated equation @xmath30\\ , .",
    "\\label{noneqsusc}\\ ] ] there are two ways a simple form for the fluctuation - dissipation theorem may emerge from eq.([noneqsusc ] ) .",
    "one is that a nonlinear field @xmath31 that is conjugate to @xmath15 can be introduced ( and effectively worked with ) .",
    "then one obtains @xmath32 and thus @xmath28 becomes the nonequilibrium @xmath33 .",
    "the other possibility is that a mean - field type decoupling scheme works well and then @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a functional of the two - point correlations ( and similar expressions are obtained for @xmath36 )",
    ". then equation ( [ noneqsusc ] ) becomes @xmath37 if the theory provides @xmath38 then the effective temperature can again be read of from the above generalized fluctuation - dissipation relationship .",
    "there are problems with both lines of reasoning .",
    "apart from the practical difficulties of nonlinear fields and the validity of mean - field type approaches , the main conceptual difficulty is the fact that changing from the magnetization to other fields ( e.g. energy ) the nonequilibrium version of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem leads to different values for the same `` temperature '' @xcite .",
    "there are cases where the above schemes generalized to time - dependent processes work both at the theoretical and the experimental levels @xcite but there are clear examples when the concept of effective temperature does not apply @xcite .",
    "thus the meaning and use of nonequilibrium temperature has not been clarified enough to make a verdict on it .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , nonequilibrium phase changes constitute a large part of interesting natural phenomena and they are studied without worries about wider contexts . from a general perspective , on the other hand , the investigations of nonequilibrium phase transitions can be viewed as an attempt to understand the robust features of ness .",
    "this view is based on the expectation that the universality displayed in critical phase transitions carries over to criticality in ness as well .",
    "if this is true then studies of the similarities to and differences from equilibrium will lead to a better understanding of the role and general consequences of the dynamics generating ness .    in the following subsections",
    ", we shall construct , describe , and discuss models which display nonequilibrium phase transitions . apart from getting familiar with a few interesting phenomena ,",
    "the main general conclusion of these discussions should be that dynamical anisotropies often yield dipole - like effective interactions and , furthermore , competing non - local dynamics ( anomalous diffusion ) generates long - range , power - law effective interactions @xcite . along the way , we shall also understand that the detailed - balance violating aspects of local relaxational dynamics do not affect the universality class of the nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "the violation of detailed balance has the consequence that not only the interactions determine the properties of the ness but the dynamics also plays an important role . in order to understand and characterize the role of dynamics , a series of simple examples",
    "will be discussed in the following subsections .",
    "first , let us discuss how to construct a model which yields a ness in the long - time limit . a simple way is to attach two heat baths to a system , each generating a detailed - balance dynamics but at different temperatures . to see an actual implementation ,",
    "let us consider how this is done for the one dimensional kinetic ising model .",
    "this type of models have been much studied and a collection of mini - reviews about them can be found in @xcite .    the state of the system @xmath39 is specified by stochastic ising variables @xmath40 assigned to lattice sites @xmath41 .",
    "the interaction is short ranged ( nearest neighbor ) @xmath42 and periodic boundary conditions @xmath43 are usually assumed .",
    "the dynamics of the system is generated by two heat baths ( labeled by @xmath44 ) at temperatures @xmath45 , meaning that the heat baths try to bring the system to equilibrium at temperature @xmath45 by e.g. spin flips and spin exchanges , respectively .",
    "let us denote the rate of the flip of @xmath46-th spin ( @xmath47 ) by @xmath48 , and let the rate of the exchanges of spins at sites @xmath46 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) be @xmath51 .",
    "then the dynamics is defined by the following master equation for the probability distribution @xmath52 : @xmath53 + & \\nonumber \\\\ & \\sum_{ij}\\left[\\ ; w_{ij}^{(2)}(\\{\\s\\}_{ij})\\ ; p(\\{\\s\\}_{ij},t ) -w_{ij}^{(2)}(\\{\\s\\})\\ ; p(\\{\\s\\},t)\\ ; \\right]&\\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the states @xmath54 and @xmath55 differ from @xmath56 by the flip of the @xmath46-th spin and by the exchange of the @xmath46-th and @xmath49-th spins , respectively .",
    "the assumption that the dynamics is generated by heath baths means that the rates satisfy detailed balance at the appropriate temperatures : @xmath57 where @xmath58}$ ] is the equilibrium distribution of the ising model at temperature @xmath45 .",
    "eq.([detbal ] ) leaves some freedom in the choice of @xmath59-s , and one is usually guided by simplicity .",
    "the most general spin flip rate that depends only on neighboring spins has the following form @xcite @xmath60\\bigl ( 1+\\delta \\s_{i+1 } \\s_{i-1}\\bigr ) \\quad . \\label{rate1}\\ ] ] without any other heath baths , equations ( [ master ] ) and ( [ rate1 ] ) define the glauber model @xcite which relaxes to the equilibrium state of the ising model at temperature @xmath1 defined through @xmath61 .",
    "the time - scale for flips is set by @xmath62 and @xmath63 is restricted to the interval @xmath64 .",
    "the competing dynamical process is the generation of spin exchanges ( kawasaki dynamics @xcite ) by a second heath bath at a temperature @xmath65 . in the simplest case ,",
    "the exchanges are between nearest neighbor sites and the rate of exchange satisfying detailed balance ( [ detbal ] ) is given by @xmath66 \\quad .",
    "\\label{rate2}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 sets the timescale of the exchanges .",
    "it is often assumed that the exchanges are random ( @xmath69 ) and thus @xmath70",
    ".    equations ( [ master ] ) , ( [ rate1 ] ) and ( [ rate2 ] ) define a model which can be shown to have a ness and one can start to ask questions about the phase transitions in this steady state .",
    "the generalizations to higher dimensions , to various combinations competing dynamics ( flip - flip , flip - exchange , exchange - exchange ) , and other types of dynamical steps ( resulting e.g. from a bulk driving field ) should be obvious .",
    "just as it should be obvious that there are not too many exactly solvable models in this field and most of the results are coming from simulations .    before turning to results , let us also introduce a langevin equation description of competing dynamics .",
    "the langevin approach has been successful in dynamic critical phenomena @xcite where the counterparts of the glauber and kawasaki models are called model a and b , correspondingly .",
    "this correspondence makes the `` two - heath - baths '' generalization straightforward .",
    "the coarse grained magnetization of the ising model is replaced by @xmath8-component order - parameter field , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( @xmath73 is the ising model , and @xmath74 is the spherical limit that allows simple analytic calculations as shown below ) .",
    "the system evolves under the combined action of local relaxation ( model a ) satisfying detailed balance at temperature @xmath1 and diffusive dynamics ( model b ) at temperature @xmath2 which yields the following langevin equation for the fourier transform @xmath75 @xmath76 here @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the free energy at temperature @xmath45 , and the kinetic coefficient @xmath79 is enforcing the conservation laws . in particular , @xmath80 in model a without conservation laws , and @xmath81 for model b with diffusive dynamics conserving the total magnetization . in case @xmath78 is the landau - ginsburg functional , we have @xmath82 \\label{glderiv}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is linear in @xmath45 and @xmath84 in the @xmath85 spherical limit .",
    "in order to ensure that in case of a single heat bath , the system relaxes to equilibrium satisfying detailed balance , the noise terms in eq.([geneqmotion ] are gaussian - markovian random forces with correlations of the form : @xmath86    eqs .",
    "( [ geneqmotion]),([glderiv ] ) and ( [ lnoise ] ) define the model for the particular competing dynamics chosen and we are now ready to deduce some features of the ness generated . of course",
    ", just as in case of kinetic ising models , the number of possible competing dynamics is infinite and the question is whether conclusions of some generality could be reached .",
    "the remarkable consequences of competing dynamics can be seen already on the example of @xmath87 flip - and - exchange model which may produce ordering even though the interactions are of short range . indeed , if @xmath1 temperature spin flips are competing with @xmath69 spin exchanges of randomly chosen pairs then the system orders below a certain @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the transition is of mean - field type and this gives a clue to understanding .",
    "indeed , let us imagine that the rate of spin exchanges is large compared to the rate of flips .",
    "then the random exchanges mix the spins in between two flips and the flipping spin sees the `` average spins '' in its neighborhood - a condition for mean - field to apply .",
    "the mean field result can also be interpreted as the generation of infinite - range effective interactions .",
    "this interpretation can be put on more solid base by studying the above model with @xmath69 spin exchanges where the probability of exchange at a distance @xmath89 is decaying with @xmath89 as @xmath90 ( the spins exchanges are @xmath91 dimensional levy flights in dimension @xmath92 ) .",
    "the system orders again below a @xmath88 and the examination of the critical exponents reveals @xcite that the transition is in the universality class of long - range interactions decaying with @xmath89 as @xmath93 .",
    "it is important to note that the above results are nonequilibrium effects which would disappear if the spin exchanges would also be at @xmath1 .",
    "let us now see if the same results can be derived from the langevin equation approach .",
    "the spin flips are translated into the model a part of the dynamics while the levy flights can be represented @xcite by anomalous diffusion with @xmath94 replaced by @xmath95 with @xmath96 being the dimension of the levy flight .",
    "thus the langevin equation becomes @xmath97 note that due to the randomness of the levy flights ( @xmath69 ) , the interaction and the nonlinear terms are missing in the levy flight part ( second line ) of the equation . as discussed in sec.[modelconst ] , the @xmath98-s are gaussian - markoffian random forces with correlations @xmath99 and @xmath100 .    in order to see the generation of long range interaction in the above model ,",
    "let us first make an exact calculation @xcite in the spherical limit @xmath101 where fluctuations in @xmath102 may be neglected and this quantity may be replaced by @xmath103 where the brackets @xmath104 denote averaging over both the initial conditions and the noises @xmath98 and @xmath105 ( we restrict ourselves to the study of the high - temperature phase where the dynamic structure factor @xmath106 is independent of @xmath49 ) .",
    "the decoupling ( [ sphericalconstr ] ) leads to a linear equation of motion and so the self - consistency equation for @xmath107 can be easily derived @xmath108 + dq^{\\sigma}\\right\\ } ds } \\ , .\\ ] ] here , the initial condition @xmath109 was used for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath110 limit does not depend on the initial condition and the equation for the steady state structure factor @xmath111 becomes @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "the long - wavelength instabilities are determined by the @xmath114 form of @xmath115 which for @xmath96 can be written as @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "this form coincides with the long - wavelength limit of the equilibrium structure factor of a spherical model in which the interactions decay with distance as @xmath118 .",
    "consequently , both the self - consistency equation for @xmath119 and the critical behavior that follows from it are identical to that of the equilibrium long - range model .",
    "thus we can conclude that the critical properties of the ness are dominated by an effective long - range potential proportional to @xmath118 .",
    "the above conclusion should be valid quite generally for finite @xmath8 as well .",
    "looking at eq.([levyeq ] ) , one can see that the correlations in the effective noise @xmath120 have an amplitude @xmath121 .",
    "one expects that the @xmath122 term can be neglected in the long - wavelength limit and thus that the noise @xmath105 in the levy - flight exchanges can be omitted . without @xmath105 , however , the system described by equation ( 2 ) satisfies detailed balance and has an effective hamiltonian which , apart from the usual short - range interaction pieces , contains the expected long - range part @xmath123 .",
    "we should note here that @xmath124 corresponds to usual diffusion and that the above arguments changes for @xmath125 since no long - range interactions are generated any more , and no change in critical behavior occurs .",
    "this result is another way of saying that model a type dynamics is robust against diffusive perturbations which break detailed balance @xcite .",
    "note also that if both the competing dynamics are relaxational then , adding up the corresponding deterministic and noise parts in the langevin equation ( [ geneqmotion ] ) , one can easily deduce that the breaking of the detailed balance does not change the universality class of the equilibrium phase transition .      in order to understand the meaning of dynamical anisotropy ,",
    "let us consider the two - temperature , diffusive kinetic ising model @xcite on a square lattice .",
    "two heat baths are attached and both of them generates nearest neighbor spin exchanges .",
    "exchanges along one of the axis ( called ` parallel ' direction ) satisfy detailed balance at temperature @xmath126 while exchanges in the ` perpendicular ' direction are produced by a heat bath of temperature @xmath127 .",
    "it is important to note that the interactions @xmath128 are the same along both axes .",
    "it is the dynamics that is anisotropic .    for @xmath129 ,",
    "this is the kawasaki model @xcite which relaxes to the equilibrium ising model at @xmath130 and , consequently , it displays a continuous transition .",
    "since the dynamics conserves the total magnetization , the ordering for @xmath131 appears as a phase separation .    for @xmath132 ,",
    "on the other hand , there is a flow of energy between the @xmath133 and @xmath134 heath baths and the system relaxes to a ness .",
    "mc simulations show that a critical phase transition is present for @xmath132 as well but the phase separation is distinct from that occurring in equilibrium .",
    "the interfaces between the domains of up and down spins align with normals along the directions of lower temperatures .",
    "thus the symmetries of the ordered states are different from the symmetry of the equilibrium order where interfaces with normals along any of axes coexist ( isotropic ordering ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the universality classes of the @xmath133 and @xmath134 orderings are found to be distinct from the ising class .",
    "renormalization group calculations actually show that the universality class of the nonequilibrium ordering is that of a uniaxial ferromagnet with dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "a dramatic demonstration of the long - range nature of the interactions generated by anisotropic dynamics comes from the generalization of the above model to @xmath135 component spins ( @xmath136 model ) .",
    "one finds that the ness in this system displays an ordering transition @xcite , a fact that would be in contradiction with the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite should the effective interaction be short - ranged .",
    "let us try now understand the generation of the dipole - like interactions using the langevin equation approach and considering the spherical limit again .",
    "the two - temperature , diffusive ising model corresponds to competition of two model b type dynamics along @xmath133 and @xmath134 axes .",
    "thus the equation of motion is @xmath137 with the diffusion in the @xmath138 directions described by the corresponding @xmath139 terms : @xmath140 \\ , .\\ ] ] where @xmath141 .",
    "note the isotropy of the interaction ( @xmath142 term ) and the different temperatures ( @xmath83 ) for diffusion in different directions .",
    "the noise correlations follow from detailed balance requirements , @xmath143    just as in the kinetic ising model for @xmath144 , we have model b with anisotropic diffusion ( not a dynamical anisotropy ! ) and with an equilibrium steady state , while a ness is produced for @xmath145 .",
    "the nature of the phase transitions in the ness becomes transparent in the spherical limit ( @xmath146 and @xmath84 ) where the fluctuations in @xmath102 may be neglected .",
    "this linearizes the equation of motion and allows to write down a selfconsistency equation for @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath110 limit then yields the steady state structure factor in the following form @xcite @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "one can see now the origin of dipole - like effective interactions .",
    "because of the dynamical anisotropy , the @xmath151 limit of @xmath152 is different whether first @xmath153 and then @xmath154 or vice versa .",
    "this singularity of the long - wavelength limit translates into such power law correlations in real space which are characteristic of dipole interactions in equilibrium systems .",
    "hence the conclusion that the dynamical anisotropy has generated dipole - like interactions .",
    "note that this is a nonequilibrium effect .",
    "the long - wavelength singularity disappears as soon as the heat baths have equal temperatures ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "the dynamical anisotropy is a strong effect and its mechanism of action is rather simple as we have seen above .",
    "accordingly , it is the most viable candidate to change the universality class of equilibrium phase transitions by breaking detailed balance @xcite .",
    "models of ness have a long history but the first one that became the center of attention and was recognized as the `` ising model '' of ness was the driven lattice gas ( see and references therein ) .",
    "the model can be understood as a kinetic ising model with the up - spins being the particles in the lattice gas .",
    "spin exchange dynamics at temperature @xmath130 represents the particle diffusion and an external bulk field @xmath155 drives the up - spins ( particles ) along one of the lattice axes @xmath156 . in order to have a ness with particle current one must also use periodic boundary conditions in the field direction",
    "this model displays a critical phase transition in its ness and the phase separation that follows at low @xmath130 is characterized by strong anisotropy : the interfaces align parallel with @xmath155 . thus one can see some similarities with the two - temperature diffusive model of sec.[long - range - int ] .",
    "one can easily recognize that dynamical anisotropy is at work here .",
    "the driving field can be considered as a second heath bath which generates the essential part of the dynamics along the @xmath157 direction .",
    "there is a difference , however , from the two - temperature model of sec.[long - range - int ] in that the drive now has a directionality ( the forward - backward symmetry of diffusion is broken ) . as a result the phase transition is expected to belong to a new ( nonequilibrium ) universality class distinct from that of the dipole class .",
    "this is indeed what has been obtained in renormalization group calculations .",
    "unfortunately , the structure of the long - wavelength singularities in the two systems are similar and thus there are difficulties in observing the differences in numerical work . this problem has generated some debate that is still going on @xcite .",
    "we believe the debate will not modify the general picture summarized in , and it will not change the conclusion about the importance of dynamical anisotropy .",
    "an interesting and important field where even the simplest systems show `` effective '' critical behavior due to the unbounded long - wavelenth fluctuations is the field of surface growth processes .",
    "most of the roughening transitions and transitions between various rough phases are genuine nonequilibrium phase transitions and have been much studied .",
    "remarkably , however , these transitions have not provided new insight into the general features of nonequilibrium criticality , they merely confirmed that the dynamics and dynamical anisotropy play an important role in determining the universality classes of growth processes .",
    "one of the unsolved problems that continues to fascinate researchers is the phase transition in the kardar - parisi - zhang equation @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the problem of growing surfaces including kpz equation in connection with the nonequilibrium distribution functions in sec.[noneqdist ] .",
    "up to this point , we have considered usual physical systems driven out of equilibrium .",
    "here i would like to give a taste of what awaits one if the studies are extended to the living realm .",
    "living creatures can also be viewed as units attached to two heat baths .",
    "one of them is the internal energy source which on a short time - scale is an infinite bath from which energy can be drawn at a given rate .",
    "the other one is the surroundings to which energy is lost by dissipation ( friction , heat loss , ... ) due to the activity of the unit .",
    "this view suggests that a collection of such self - propelled units will show orderings ( nonequilibrium phase transitions ) depending on the interactions between the units , on their density , on their possible motions and on the dissipation mechanisms .",
    "indeed , collective behavior is often observed in flocks of birds , in schools of fish , in swimming cells , etc . and ,",
    "as shown below , some of these phenomena can be described in terms of a surprisingly simple model .",
    "model @xcite was introduced to describe the collective motion of self - propelled particles with birds and bacteria being candidates for these particles .",
    "we shall use the language of `` birds '' below .    .",

    "one can see that local orientational order develops in the initial stages of relaxation ( the state here shows resemblance to the states in classical xy ferromagnet ) while the stationary state with almost full orientational order shows large density fluctuations .",
    "the structure and the large density fluctuations observed in the ordered state and , furthermore , the measurements of the critical exponents of the transition @xcite suggest that the ordering in this system is in a universality so far not encountered .",
    "a remarkable field theory has also been constructed for flocking @xcite .",
    "it is a generalized navier - stokes equation with additional model a type terms which drive the velocity to @xmath169 .",
    "this theory explains the large density fluctuations present in the ordered state .",
    "the investigation of ordering transition is at a higher level of difficulty , however , and has not been completed yet .",
    "clearly , much remains to be done before we understand flocking and before the model can be compared with experiments quantitatively .",
    "nevertheless , activity is expected in this direction since the model of flocking is not much more complicated than the more standard ness models discussed above , and , at the same time , it has close connection with experimentally observable , truly `` far - from - equilibrium '' phenomena .",
    "hopefully , by designing and understanding similar models , a kind of `` universality map '' of the collective dynamics of self - driven units can be found .",
    "systems displaying power law behavior in their various characteristics ( correlation in space or time , fluctuation power spectra , size - distributions , etc . ) are abundant in nature .",
    "the most impressive examples are found in biology ( e.g. the metabolic rate vs. mass relationship for living creatures displays scaling over 28 decades @xcite ) but there are remarkable examples in solid state physics ( power spectra of voltage fluctuations when a current is flowing through a resistor @xcite - 6 decades of scaling ) , in geology ( the number of earthquakes vs. their magnitude @xcite - 5 decades ) and scaling over 2 - 3 decades is seen everywhere [ see e.g. the white - dwarf light emission @xcite , the flow of sand through an hourglass @xcite , the number of daily trades in the stock market @xcite , water flow fluctuations of rivers @xcite , the spike trains of nerve cells @xcite , the traffic flow on a highway @xcite , interface fluctuations @xcite , dissipation in the turbulent systems @xcite ] .    understanding the ( possibly ) common origins of scaling in the above phenomena appears to be a highly nontrivial task .",
    "power laws , of course , arise naturally in critical phenomena and we understand them : their origins are in the diverging fluctuations at the critical point .",
    "thus the first question one may ask is the following .    * can the power laws just be the result of nonequilibrium phase transitions and the associated critical behavior ?    in equilibrium systems",
    ", however , one must tune a parameter to its critical value in order to observe scale - invariant behavior while nonequilibrium systems appear to be in scale - invariant states without any tuning .",
    "thus the answer to the first question appears to be negative .",
    "the wide variety of the phenomena in the above list suggests that the next question could be as follows .",
    "* can the scaling merely be a natural outcome of complex dynamics ?",
    "after all , we have seen in sec.[long - range - int ] that competing dynamics may generate long - range ( power - law ) interactions which may be at the origin of scaling even away from a critical point .",
    "the answer to this question may be a yes but , unfortunately , many of the problems mentioned are not amenable to an analysis in terms of simple competing dynamics and then the following question remains unanswered :    * what are the ingredients of complex dynamics which determine the existence and the characteristics ( e.g. exponents ) of the power laws ?",
    "there is an attempt to answer all the above question in affirmative along a logic that begins with the notion of self - organized criticality ( soc ) introduced by bak , tang and wiesenfeld @xcite .",
    "according to this notion , systems with complex dynamics tune themselves to a state with a kind of avalanche type dynamics that is underlying a large number of scale - invariant phenomena .",
    "the notion of soc has now been understood in terms of an interplay between local and non - local dynamics @xcite which indeed tunes the system @xcite to a nonequilibrium ( absorbing - state ) critical point .",
    "then the problem of soc is reduced to investigating the absorbing state transitions @xcite and the characteristics of power laws can be determined by studying the universality of absorbing state transition .",
    "this is an interesting and active field of research and it is worth understanding the main points .",
    "accordingly , i will discuss soc in the next subsection , and will explain the connection to absorbing state transitions in the following one .      the first model of soc",
    "was introduced to describe sandpiles .",
    "later developments , however , made energy packets from the grains of sand , so the balls in fig.[fig : soc ] will be grains at the beginning but will be called energy packets later . the dynamics defining the model consists of local and non - local elements .",
    "the sites of a ( usually ) two - dimensional lattice are occupied by grains and the local aspect of their dynamics is in the redistribution of the grains . if a site contains more than @xmath170 grains ( e.g. @xmath171 on a square lattice ) then the site is active and @xmath170 grains are redistributed to the neighboring lattice sites .",
    "the redistribution of particles ( avalanche ) continues until active sites are found .     particles",
    ". then redistribution to neighboring sites take place and particles disappear ( dissipation of energy ) at the edges .",
    "the process continues until all active sites are eliminated .",
    "then the particles source is switched on again . ]    clearly , an avalanche stops after a while since the redistribution leads to loss of particles at the boundaries ( or , in terms of the energy model , dissipation occurs at the boundaries ) .",
    "once the avalanche stopped , an external supervisor notices it ( this is the nonlocal part of the dynamics ) and starts to add new particles ( energy is injected into the system ) until a new avalanche starts .",
    "the above dynamics yields a stationary state in the long - time limit , and the steady state characteristics of avalanches can be measured .",
    "such a characteristics is e.g. the number of sites @xmath172 which become active during the process , and the remarkable feature of this model is that the distribution of @xmath172 ( and of other quantities such as the spatial size and the lifetime of the avalanches ) is found to display a power law form @xmath173    thus one discovers that although the model does not contain parameters to tune , nevertheless it shows critical behavior ( @xmath170 can be changed without changing the criticality of the outcome ) .",
    "this observation generated a large amount of activity and _ criticality - without - tuning _ was seen in a number of similar models @xcite .",
    "the resulting notion of _ self - organized criticality _ grew in importance @xcite and , accordingly , new effort was put into understanding how soc works .",
    "an important feature that was recognized quite early @xcite is the existence of a _ non - local supervisor _ who watches the activity of the avalanches and , upon ceasing of the activity , switches on the source of particles ( or of energy ) . in principle ,",
    "non - local dynamics can generate long - range correlations in both time and space so the emergence of criticality is not necessary a surprise .",
    "viewing the problem from another angle , the non - local dynamics separates the timescales of the avalanches and of the particle injection .",
    "thus , in practice , there is tuning .",
    "namely , the system is considered in the limit of particle injection rate going to zero ( actually , the dissipation is also tuned to zero since the particles disappear only at the boundaries of the system ) .    the zero injection rate , however",
    ", does not have to be a critical point , and the next important development was @xcite the demonstration that it is indeed a nonequilibrium ( absorbing state ) critical point .",
    "absorbing state transitions appear in many contexts in nonequilibrium statistical physics , and they are studied intensively since they are thought to be one of the truly nonequilibrium phenomena without counterpart in equilibrium systems . in order to understand the basics of it , let us consider a fixed energy sandpile model @xcite shown on fig.[fig : fixe ] .",
    "units of energy ( the units which are redistributed in the next time - step are marked by large dots in their center ) .",
    "the total energy of the system is conserved since the boundaries prevent the loss of energy . ]",
    "this model differs from the sandpile model by calling the particles energy units , and by the absence of both the injection and the dissipation of energy ( particles ) . thus the total energy @xmath174 is conserved and as one can easily see from fig.[fig : fixe ]",
    "the behavior of the system is essentially different at small and large values of @xmath174 . at small @xmath175",
    ", the activity ( redistribution ) ceases in the long - time limit and the system falls into a so called _ absorbing state_. for large @xmath176 , on the other hand , there are always active sites and the redistribution continues forever . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the system settles into a steady state which is called _ active state _ and the _ activity _ can be quantified by measuring e.g. the number of active sites .",
    "one finds then that the absorbing state transition ( i.e. the absorbing - active state transition ) is a critical phase transition with the _ activity _ changing continously through the transition point @xmath177 ( see fig.[fig : soc - abs ] ) .    .",
    "the evolution of the system as dissipation at the boundaries or the energy injection is switched given by the left and right arrows , respectively . ]",
    "once the absorbing state transition is understood , it is easy to make the connection to soc .",
    "indeed , let us assume that we have the fixed energy sandpile in the active state ( @xmath176 ) and let us switch on the dissipation at the boundaries .",
    "then the energy decreases slowly ( note that the dissipation is proportional to the surface of the sample while @xmath174 is proportional to the volume ) .",
    "this lowering of energy will continue until @xmath174 reaches just below @xmath177 when the system falls into the absorbing state and thus the dissipation stops .",
    "let us now return to the fixed energy sandpile but this time let us start from an absorbing state ( @xmath175 ) and switch on the `` external supervisor '' who is injecting energy into the system .",
    "the supervisor is required to stop the injection if adding of the last energy packet started activity in the system .",
    "this process increases the energy @xmath174 infinitesimally slowly and brings the system near and perhaps slightly past the threshold of activity @xmath178 .",
    "now , if both the dissipation at the boundaries and the `` external supervisor '' are present then the fixed energy sandpile model is nothing else but the sandpile model generating soc .",
    "and we see that soc emerges because the combined action of the dissipation and the `` supervisor '' brings the system to the critical point of the absorbing state transition of the fixed energy sandpile model .",
    "the mechanism unmasked above is rather general and present in many models of self organized criticality .",
    "the value of recognizing this mechanism lies in making it possible to describe and calculate scaling properties of soc by studying `` usual '' nonequilibrium phase transitions . in particular , one may hope that field - theoretic description of soc may be obtained through studies of the appropriate absorbing state transitions .    of course",
    ", absorbing state transitions are numerous and it is not obvious which one is in the same universality class as a given system displaying soc . in general , continuous phase transitions to an absorbing state are in the universality class of _ directed percolation _ that can be described by the following reaction diffusion process @xmath179 directed percolation is rather robust to various changes in its rules but the presence of extra symmetries ( conservation laws ) may change the universality class of an absorbing state transition .",
    "a well known example is the _ parity conserving process _ which has the following reaction - diffusion representation @xmath180 both of the above processes have been much investigated and the scaling properties have been accurately determined .",
    "furthermore , understanding ( if not complete solution ) has emerged even on field theoretic level .",
    "unfortunately , neither of the above processes have been directly related to models of soc .",
    "accordingly , the present day research is concentrated on absorbing state transitions which have more contact with soc .",
    "an example is the critical point observed in the so called _ pair contact process _",
    "@xcite where particles diffuse only through the birth - death processes given by the reaction scheme @xmath181 where the first and the second reactions take place with probabilities @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "a related problem is the epidemic model @xcite where the reaction scheme @xmath184 describes static healthy subjects ( @xmath185 ) getting infected by diffusing infectious agents ( @xmath186 ) who , in turn , recover with time .",
    "the last two models are close to the fixed energy sandpile models ( and thus to soc ) in that both of them have an infinite number of absorbing states and their coarse - grained description involves an order parameter ( the active particles ) coupled to a static field ( the temporarily immobile particles ) . it has recently been suggested that the similarity may go deeper , i.e. they all belong to the same universality class @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is based on a field - theoretic calculation near dimension @xmath187 @xcite using langevin equations which were suggested on phenomenological grounds for the processes ( [ pcp1 ] ) and ( [ epidemic1 ] ) . at this point",
    "there is still a debate about both the applicability of the langevin equations and the validity of the results in lower dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that the approach of soc through absorbing state transitions may be coming to an interesting and satisfactory conclusion .    of course",
    ", one should not forget that apart from the connection to soc , absorbing state transitions in general constitute an important problem in the theory of ness .",
    "the field is developing fast and there are many interesting details scattered across the papers . a guide to the models and to the extensive literature about them",
    "can be found in recent reviews .",
    "the simplicity of the description of equilibrium system lies in the existence of the gibbs distribution i.e. in the elimination of the dynamics from the calculation of averages .",
    "although dynamics is clearly important in nonequilibrium steady states , it is not inconceivable that a prescription exist for a nonequilibrium equivalent of the gibbs distribution which would include the essential features of the dynamics .",
    "such a distribution function may have singularities as shown in simple examples or it may have problems with the additivity of the associated entropies ( which is not unexpected in systems with long - range correlations ) @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a prescription with well defined restrictions on its applicability would be valuable and the search for nonequilibrium distribution function(s ) has been going on for some time .",
    "a phenomenological approach to the above problem is the non - extensive statistical mechanics @xcite , an approach that takes its name from the nonextensive character of the postulated entropy .",
    "this approach has been much developed during the last decade , and not surprisingly , is has its success in connection with systems which have long - range interactions or display ( multi)fractal behavior @xcite .    below we shall present a alternative approach that is somewhat less general but it is based on the extention of our knowledge of universality of distribution functions in strongly fluctuating systems .",
    "distribution functions of additive quantities such as e.g. the total magnetization in the ising model are gaussian in usual equilibrium systems .",
    "this gaussianity follows from the central limit theorem that is applicable due to the correlations being short ranged away from critical points . at critical points , however , the power law correlations result in non - gaussian distributions .",
    "the emerging distributions are quite restricted in their possible shapes , however , the reason being that the distribution functions at critical points are scaling functions and their shape is determined by the universality class associated with the given critical point .",
    "the above observation can be used to develop a classification of nonequilibrium distribution functions .",
    "namely , one knows that `` effective '' criticality ( i.e. strong fluctuations and power - law correlations ) is the norm for nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "of course , the `` effective '' critical behavior is determined not only by the interactions but by the dynamics as well .",
    "accordingly , one may expect that the scaling functions ( and thus the distribution of macroscopic quantities ) are determined by the nonequilibrium universality classes .",
    "once we build a gallery of such scaling functions , we can use them in the same way as in the equilibrium case : we can identify symmetries and underlying mechanisms in experimental systems ; we may find seemingly different systems belonging to the same universality class , and thus we can discover common underlying processes present in those systems .",
    "we can also use these distribution functions to find the critical dimension of a model and the applications are restricted only by imagination .",
    "below we shall show how to calculate these distribution functions in simple systems and present a few applications .      the simplest nonequilibrium systems displaying `` effective '' criticality are the growing surfaces .",
    "they are rough quite generally which means that the mean - square fluctuations of the surface diverge with system size .",
    "the roughness is defined by @xmath188 ^ 2 \\sim l^\\chi \\quad , \\label{widthsq}\\ ] ] where @xmath189 is the area of the substrate of characteristic linear dimension @xmath190 , @xmath191 is the average height of the surface , and @xmath192 is a critical exponent characterizing the given universality class .",
    "we shall be interested in the steady - state distribution of @xmath193 and expect that due to criticality , the diverging scale @xmath194 will be the only relevant scale in @xmath195 and , consequently , it can be written in a scaling from @xmath196 where @xmath197 is a scaling function characteristic of the universality class the growth process belong to .",
    "below , we show how to calculate @xmath198 for a simple growth process ( edwards - wilkinson equation @xcite ) and will demonstrate that the @xmath198-s are different for growth processes distinct in the sense of distinct universality classes .     and the width of the surface @xmath199 is characterized by the mean - square fluctuation . the vertical velocity of the surface in general a function of the local properties of the surface , @xmath200 . ]",
    "let us begin by discussing the equations for growing surfaces .",
    "in general , deposition of particles on a substrate , under the assumption that the surface formed is a single valued function @xmath201 , can be described by the equation @xmath202 where @xmath203 gives the velocity of advance of the interface perpendicular to the substrate ( fig.[fig : surface ] ) .",
    "the velocity is usually written as @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the average velocity due to the average rate of deposition , @xmath206 is related both to the motion of the particles on the surface and to the dependence of the growth on the inclination of the surface .",
    "finally the fluctuations in the above processes are collected in @xmath98 which is assumed to be a gaussian white noise in both space and time .    a simple form for @xmath206 follows from the assumption that particles like to stick at points with large number of neighbors i.e. at large @xmath207 .",
    "then , @xmath206 is approximated as @xmath208 and , in the frame moving with @xmath205 , one has the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) model @xcite of surface growth @xmath209 this equation can be solved and one finds that the steady - state probability distribution is given by @xmath210=ae^{-\\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\int_0^l(\\nabla h)^2dx } \\label{ewhdist}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is related to @xmath211 and to the amplitude of the white noise .",
    "once @xmath212 $ ] is known , @xmath195 is formally obtained from @xmath213)\\rangle \\label{pw2definition}\\ ] ] where the average @xmath104 is over all @xmath214 with the distribution function @xmath212 $ ] ( note that @xmath215 is a spatial average and it is still a fluctuating quantity ) . in practice , it is more convenient to calculate the generating function @xmath216 with the above expression demonstrating why @xmath195 can be calculated analytically in simple models .",
    "namely , if the partition function with @xmath217 can be found then the generating function ( [ glambda ] ) is just the partition function of the model with a quadratic term added and such term usually does not spoil the solvability of the problem .",
    "indeed , e.g. in case of the d=1 ew model with periodic boundary conditions , the problem is reduced to the evaluation of the partition function of a d=1 quantum oscillator thus obtaining @xcite @xmath218 now one can find the average width diverging @xmath219 in the @xmath220 limit .",
    "using @xmath194 to eliminate @xmath190 from ( [ glambda2 ] ) , one observes that @xmath221 is a function of the product @xmath222 only and , consequently the inverse laplace transform yields @xmath195 the scaling form ( [ phi ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the scaling function @xmath197 consist of collecting contributions from the poles in @xmath221 and one obtains @xmath223 fig.[fig : ew - mh ] shows the above function displaying a characteristic shape of exponential decay @xmath224 at large @xmath157 and essential singularity @xmath225 for @xmath226 .        on fig.[fig",
    ": ew - mh ] we have also included the results for the so called curvature driven growth process which is also called the mullins - herring model of surface growth @xcite .",
    "this is a model where the rearrangement of deposited particles goes on by surface diffusion and the particle current @xmath227 is towards places where there are many neighboring particles i.e. @xmath228 is large .",
    "this means that @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the resulting equation is called the mullins - herring ( mh ) equation @xmath231 the surfaces described by the mh equation belong to a universality class distinct from that of the ew growth .",
    "indeed , the mh equation can be solved easily and one finds that @xmath232 in contrast to the ew result @xmath233 .",
    "accordingly , the scaling function should also be different .",
    "a calculation similar to that described above for the ew case verifies this expectation @xcite as can be observed on fig.[fig : ew - mh ] .    an important point to remark about the comparisons of the ew and mh curves is that they are well distinguishable .",
    "their maximum , their small @xmath157 cutoff , and their decay at large @xmath157 are all sufficiently different so that no ambiguity would arise when analyzing experimental data . indeed , the @xmath234 versions of the above @xmath198-s as well as a number of others characterizing various growth processes have been obtained in @xcite and it did not appear to be difficult to pick the scaling function which was corresponding to a given set of experiments @xcite .    finding out the universality class of a growth process is one possible application if one has a sufficiently developed gallery of scaling functions .",
    "below we discuss other possibilities for application .",
    "the kpz equation @xcite is the simplest nonlinear model describing growth in terms of a moving interface .",
    "it differs from the ew model by taking into account that the surface grows in the direction of its normal provided the incoming particles have no anisotropy in their arrival direction .",
    "then the @xmath235 component of the velocity of the surface has a correction term proportional to @xmath236 as shown on fig.[fig : surface ] and the equation in lowest order in the nonlinearities becomes the so called kpz equation @xmath237 here @xmath211 and @xmath238 are parameters , while @xmath239 is again a gaussian white noise .",
    "the steady state surfaces generated by ( [ kpzeq ] ) appear to be rough ( critical ) in any dimension if the nonequilibrium drive ( @xmath238 ) is large enough .",
    "since eq.([kpzeq ] ) gives account of a number of interesting phenomena ( burgers turbulence , directed polymers in random media , etc . )",
    "lots of efforts have been spent on finding and understanding the scaling properties of its solutions .",
    "nevertheless , a number of unsolved issues remain , the question of upper critical dimension ( @xmath240 ) being the most controversial one . on one hand mode - coupling and",
    "other phenomenological theories suggest that @xmath241 @xcite while all the numerical work fail to find a finite @xmath240 and the indication is that @xmath242 @xcite . below",
    "i would like to show how the scaling functions of the roughness can shed some light on this controversy @xcite .",
    "let us begin with the observation that scaling functions do not change above @xmath240 .",
    "thus if we build @xmath197 in dimensions @xmath243 and observe that they differ significantly in @xmath244 and @xmath245 then we can conclude that @xmath246 .",
    "since @xmath197 can not be exactly calculated for @xmath247 we must evaluate it through simulations with the results displayed on fig.[fig : kpzdistr ] .    .",
    "]    as one can see on fig.[fig : kpzdistr ] , the scaling functions change smoothly with @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath197-s get narrower and more centered on @xmath248 with increasing @xmath92 , and there is no break in this behavior at @xmath244 .",
    "the equality of the d=4 and 5 scaling functions appears to be excluded .    of course ,",
    "our result is coming from numerical work with the same general conclusion as in previous studies .",
    "so , why is it more believable ? because one of the main criticism of numerical studies does not apply to it .",
    "namely , no fitting parameters and fitting procedures are used in contrast to the usual determination of critical exponents .",
    "one just builds the histograms , calculates the averages to determine the scaling variable and plots the scaled histogram .",
    "this is clear and well understood but there is another remarkable feature in these scaling functions the origin of which is less obvious .",
    "namely , the scaling functions in principle should depend on the size of the system , @xmath249 what is observed , however , is that the @xmath190 dependence is practically all in @xmath250 and @xmath190 dependence of the shape of @xmath198 ( explicit dependence on @xmath190 ) disappears already at small @xmath190 .",
    "these are important points and the kpz application of the scaling functions was mainly chosen to emphasize them .",
    "it seems that these scaling functions are versatile tools which can be used in computer science @xcite as well as in understanding the propagation of chemical fronts @xcite .",
    "an interesting application was e.g. the establishment of a connection between the energy fluctuations in a turbulence experiment and the interface fluctuations in the @xmath234 edwards - wilkinson model @xcite , and thus prompting a search for an interface interpretation of the dissipative structure in the turbulent system @xcite . in another case",
    ", it helped to make a link between the much studied @xmath251 noise and the extreme value statistics @xcite .",
    "since the effective criticality is a real feature of many nonequilibrium system , we expect that many more use will be found for the scaling functions discussed in this section .",
    "quantum critical points are associated with the change of the symmetry of the ground state of a quantum system as the interactions or an external field ( control parameter ) are varied .",
    "they have been much investigated in recent years with the motivation coming from solid state physics @xcite .",
    "namely , the strongly - correlated electron systems often produce power law correlations , and the origin of the observed scale - invariance is suggested to be the presence of a quantum critical point at @xmath252 provided the effect of the quantum phase transition is felt at finite @xmath130 as well .    from our point of view , the quantum phase transitions are interesting because they are good candidates for studying the effects of a nonequilibrium drive on well established symmetry - breaking transitions .",
    "the advantage of these systems is that there is no arbitrariness in their dynamics ( it is given by quantum mechanics ) , the one - dimensional systems are simple with examples of exactly solvable models displaying genuine critical phase transitions ( see e.g. the transverse ising chains discussed below ) and , furthermore , there is much previous work to build on .",
    "the only problem is how to force a quantum system into a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "an obvious way is to attach two heat baths of different temperatures at the two ends of a spin chain .",
    "unfortunately , this makes the problem unsolvable ( even numerically ) for any reasonable size system @xcite and thus it is practically impossible e.g. to draw conclusions about the long - range correlations generated in the system .",
    "below we show a way to avoid the problem of heat baths .",
    "the idea is that the nonequilibrium steady states always carry some flux ( of energy , particle , momentum , etc . ) .",
    "thus a steady state that is presumably not very far from the one generated by boundary conditions may be constructed by constraining the quantum system to have a flux equal to the one generated by the boundary conditions .",

    "the scaling behavior at and near @xmath268 belongs to the @xmath234 ising universality class .    in order to constrain the above system to carry a given energy flux @xmath269 we shall use the lagrange multiplier method .",
    "namely , we add a term @xmath270 to the hamiltonian where @xmath271 is the local energy flux operator summed over all sites , and find that value of @xmath238 which produces a ground state with the expectation value @xmath272 .",
    "the above scheme requires the knowledge of the local energy current , @xmath273 .",
    "it can be obtained using the quantum mechanical equation of motion for the energy density @xmath274 $ ] , and representing the result as a divergence of the energy current @xmath275 . the calculation yields ( @xmath276 is used in the following ) @xmath277 and this allows to construct the ` macroscopic ' current @xmath278 .",
    "adding it to @xmath279 with a lagrange multiplier , @xmath280 , @xmath281 we obtain the hamiltonian whose ground states with @xmath282 will give us information about the current carrying states of @xmath279 .    in order to avoid confusion , we emphasize that the energy current , @xmath271 , is associated with @xmath279 and not with the new hamiltonian , @xmath283 .",
    "we also note that @xmath283 is just another equilibrium hamiltonian , it differs from @xmath279 by an extra term which breaks the left - right symmetry of @xmath279 . finding the ground state of @xmath283",
    ", however , gives us the minimum energy state of @xmath279 which carries an energy current , @xmath284 .",
    "thus the ground - state properties of @xmath283 provide us with the properties of the nonequilibrium steady states of the transverse ising model .",
    "it turns out that @xmath285=0 $ ] and @xmath283 can be diagonalized by the same transformations which diagonalize @xmath279 @xcite , and one arrives to a system of free fermions with a spectrum of excitation energies given by @xmath286 where @xmath287 with the wave numbers restricted to @xmath288 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath289 ) .    ) which drives the current of energy .",
    "the excitation energies are given as @xmath290 .",
    "increasing the drive makes the ground - state change at a critical @xmath291 ( @xmath292 for @xmath293 ) when negative energy states start to appear and get occupied .",
    "the qualitative picture is the same at all transverse fields @xmath253 . ]",
    "fig.[spectrum ] displays the spectrum for @xmath293 and various @xmath238 and one can see that the @xmath294 symmetry of the spectrum is broken for @xmath295 .",
    "nevertheless , for small @xmath238 the ground - state remains that of the transverse ising model ( @xmath296 ) since @xmath297 and the occupation number representation of the ground state does not change .",
    "accordingly , no energy current flows @xmath298 for @xmath299 .",
    "this rigidity of the ground state against the symmetry - breaking field which drives the energy current is a consequence of the facts that the fermionic spectrum of the transverse ising model has a gap and that the operator @xmath271 commutes with @xmath279 ( similar rigidity is observed in the studies of energy flux through transverse @xmath300 chain @xcite ) .",
    "plane where @xmath253 is the transverse field while @xmath238 is the effective field which drives the flux of energy .",
    "power - law correlations are present in the nonequilibrium phase ( @xmath301 ) and on the ising critical line in the equilibrium phase ( @xmath302 , dashed line ) . ]",
    "the ground - state properties do change when @xmath303 in an interval @xmath304 $ ] and these @xmath305 states become occupied . due to the resulting asymmetry in the occupation of the @xmath305 and @xmath306 states ,",
    "the energy current becomes nonzero .",
    "the line @xmath307 which separates the region of unchanged transverse ising behavior from the @xmath308 region is obtained from the conditions @xmath309 and @xmath310 , and is displayed on the phase diagram ( fig.[fig : phasedia ] ) as a solid line . another phase boundary on fig.[fig : phasedia ]",
    "is shown by dashed line .",
    "it separates the magnetically ordered ( @xmath311 , @xmath312 ) and disordered ( @xmath313 , @xmath314 ) transverse ising regions .",
    "since the ground state is independent of @xmath238 for @xmath315 , one has the same second order transition across the dashed line as at @xmath316 and @xmath296 i.e. it belongs to the @xmath234 ising universality class @xcite .",
    "clearly , one can view the region @xmath315 as an equilibrium phase while the @xmath317 region as a nonequilibrium one since there is a nonzero energy flux through the latter .",
    "this flux can actually be calculated easily with the simple result @xmath318    apart from the fact that @xmath308 , the @xmath317 region should also be considered as a distinct phase since the long - range magnetic order existing for @xmath311 breaks down when @xmath308 and the magnetic correlations become oscillatory with amplitudes decaying as a power of distance .",
    "indeed , this can be seen by investigating the @xmath319 correlations which can be expressed through pfaffians @xcite and thus making possible numerical calculations for @xmath320 . in the presence of",
    "long - range order one should have @xmath321 for @xmath146 while we find that the correlations decay to zero at large distances as @xmath322 where the wavenumber , @xmath323 .",
    "the above result ( [ xxcorr ] ) is coming from numerics and it is exact in the @xmath324 limit where the correlations are those of the @xmath87 @xmath300 model @xcite",
    ".    one can observe power - law correlations for @xmath325 in other physical quantities as well .",
    "for example , the envelopes of both @xmath326 and @xmath327 correlations behave as @xmath328 in the large @xmath8 limit @xcite .",
    "thus we arrive to the main conclusion of this section , namely that a simple , exactly soluble quantum system shows power - law correlations in the current carrying state in agreement with the notion that power - law correlations are a ubiquitous feature of nonequilibrium steady states .",
    "actually , remembering that power - law correlations in quantum models are associated with a gapless excitation spectrum , we can reformulate the transverse ising model result to see a general connection between the emergence of power - law correlations and the presence of a current .",
    "indeed , let us assume that a system with hamiltonian @xmath329 has a spectrum with a gap between the ground - state and the lowest excited state .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath330 be a ` macroscopic ' current of a conserved quantity such that @xmath331=0 $ ] .",
    "generally , there is no current in the ground state and adding @xmath332 to @xmath329 does not change the @xmath333 result for small @xmath238 .",
    "current can flow only if some excited states mix with the ground state and , consequently , a branch of the excitation spectrum must come down and intersect the ground - state energy in order to have @xmath334 .",
    "once this happens , however , the gap disappears and one can expect power - law correlations in the current - carrying state . admittedly , the above argument is not strict and is just a reformulation ( in general terms ) of what we learned from the transverse ising model .",
    "we believe , however , that the above picture is robust and suggestive enough to try to find other soluble examples displaying the flux @xmath335 power - law - correlations relationship .",
    "when using the lagrange multiplier method , one assumes that the flux generated by boundary conditions can be replaced by the effective interactions contained in an appropriately chosen global flux @xmath330 .",
    "these interactions are generally short ranged since the flux is usually a sum of local terms .",
    "the short - range nature of the effective interactions is actually not in contradiction with the power - law correlation being generated since the lagrange multiplier gets tuned in order to achieve a given flux and , furthermore , the tuning is not quite trivial since @xmath238 must be increased past a critical value in order to have e.g. a nonzero flux energy .",
    "the question nevertheless arises whether adding a flux term in @xmath283 was an adequate description for the nonequilibrium steady state which is expected to display power - law correlations .    in order to investigate the above question one would have to solve the problem with the boundary drive but , as discussed above",
    ", an exact solution does not seem to be feasible .",
    "instead , however , one can prepare initial conditions which will lead in the long - time limit to a steady flux .",
    "then the steady state obtained in this natural way can be compared to the one found by the lagrange multiplier method .",
    "this program has been carried out @xcite for the @xmath300 chain defined by the following hamiltonian @xmath336 in this model , the transverse magnetization @xmath337 is conserved and one can investigate the nonequilibrium states which carry a given magnetization flux by using the lagrange multiplier method @xcite . at the same time , the model is simple enough so that one can solve the time dependent problem where a steady magnetization flux is achieved by starting with an inhomogeneous initial state that is the ground state at fixed magnetization but with @xmath338 reversed from @xmath339 for @xmath340 to @xmath341 for @xmath342 .    .",
    "they diminish the magnetization and leave behind a homogeneous @xmath343 state . in the scaling limit @xmath344 , @xmath345 , the magnetization @xmath346 is given by @xmath347 for @xmath348 , @xmath349 for @xmath350 , @xmath351 for @xmath352 , and @xmath353 for @xmath354 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "the time - evolution of this step - like initial state can be followed exactly and the magnetization profile emerging in the long - time limit is shown on fig.[fig : magprof ] .",
    "the remarkable feature of this magnetization profile is the middle part which is an @xmath355 homogeneous state carrying a magnetization flux @xmath356 . comparing this state to the one generated by adding the flux term to the hamiltonian and fixing the lagrange multiplier to have the same @xmath356",
    ", we find that various expectation values such as the energy , the occupation number in fermionic representation are all equal in the two states .",
    "thus the lagrange multiplier yields a correct description of the states carrying a magnetization flux .",
    "it should be noted , however , that recent calculation with an inhomogeneous initial state of different temperatures ( @xmath1 for @xmath357 and @xmath2 for @xmath354 ) has yielded a different result for the asymptotic state carrying an _ energy _",
    "flux @xcite .",
    "namely , it was shown that , at least in the neighborhood of @xmath358 and in the @xmath359 limit , the properties of the flux - carrying state can be interpreted in terms of the ground state of an effective hamiltonian @xmath360 where @xmath361 is a product of local operators at sites @xmath49 and @xmath362 , and the interaction is of long - range type since @xmath363 @xcite ( remarkably , the first two operators @xmath364 and @xmath365 are those appearing in the lagrange multiplier treatment of the energy flux in the @xmath300 chain ) . although the homogeneity of the asymptotic state was not shown and thus the comparison may be questioned , the above result indicates that the lagrange multiplier approach may be only a first approximation in describing the flux - carrying states .    in summary , the studies of quantum systems described above",
    "strengthen the view that fluxes generate long - range correlations .",
    "furthermore , the quantum systems also give a simple picture of how the emergence of these correlations is related to the closing a gap in the excitation spectrum above the ground state .",
    "there are topics which are important but were not discussed in these lectures . to mention a few",
    ", there is a large body of work on one - dimensional systems displaying nonequilibrium phase transitions , on orderings of granular gases under shear , on pattern formation with phase transitions described by the complex - coefficient landau - ginzburg equation , and the list could be continued .",
    "my choice of topics mainly reflects my past work and my attempts to develop simple starting points for making inroads into the beautiful but rather difficult field of far from equilibrium phenomena .",
    "finally , i was asked to provide entertainment for readers by trying to guess the future developments in connection with nonequilibrium orderings .",
    "well , one of the present problem of the field is the lack of simple experimental systems which can be be taken far enough from equilibrium and compared to elementary models of ness .",
    "search for such systems will intensify and i expect that there will be a shift towards biological problems . there the condition of being far from equilibrium is satisfied and there may be surprisingly simple phenomena under the guise of complicated pictures .",
    "this line of research may in the future meet up with game theories generalized to take into account spatial structures .",
    "search for better understanding of the emerging effective interactions will also continue , just as the sorting out of the absorbing - state transitions ( surprising connections may be still found there , in addition the existing one to soc ) .",
    "i also believe that theory of nonequilibrium distributions will be much developed , and limiting distributions such as the ones emerging in extreme statistics will have a much wider use in physics .",
    "these are more or less safe bets .",
    "and then there is the unpredictable part of future .",
