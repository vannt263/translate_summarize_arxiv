    "this fact suggests a close relationship between the geometry of @xmath12 and that of the underlying space @xmath7 .",

    "we assume that @xmath12 has a cone structure and is isometric to the direct product of some metric space @xmath267 and @xmath223 .",
    "we denote by @xmath268 the element in @xmath269 corresponding to the vertex of @xmath12 . for any @xmath229 in @xmath223 ,",
    "the map given by @xmath270 is an isometry ; therefore @xmath271 must correspond to the vertex , i.e. , a dirac measure ( corollary  [ vertex ] ) .",
    "next , we fix an arbitrary @xmath14 in @xmath7 and find @xmath272 in @xmath269 corresponding to @xmath65 in @xmath12",
    ". then there exists a unique geodesic ray @xmath273 from the vertex @xmath268 passing through @xmath274 at @xmath275 . by the argument used in the proof of the `` only if '' part of theorem  [ ippan ]",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath276 must be corresponding to a dirac measure for any positive number @xmath73 . then consider the geodesic ray @xmath277 in @xmath269 given by @xmath278 for some fixed @xmath235 in @xmath223 .",

    ", his result ensures that the rank of the @xmath0-wasserstein space over any alexandrov space of non - negative curvature is the same as that of the underlying space , since being non - branching everywhere is one of the fundamental properties of alexandrov spaces with lower curvature bound ."
