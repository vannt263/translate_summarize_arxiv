    "frustrated magnetism has been actively studied for decades,@xcite and interest continues to grow . in models like the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) @xmath7-@xmath8 model on a bipartite lattice , frustration results from a competition between two different ground state spin structures , one favored by @xmath7 and the other by @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite the @xmath7-@xmath8 model has motivated many interesting theoretical studies , but the tuning of energy scales to induce frustration is not easily achieved experimentally .",
    "another class of materials and models exhibit frustration at the level of nearest neighbor interactions via a competition imposed by the lattice geometry , creating geometric frustration .",
    "@xcite crystal geometries formed from unit triangles and afm interactions are frustrated because the spins about a triangle can not arrange themselves so that all pairwise interactions are satisfied ( i.e. , @xmath9 for @xmath10 can not be minimized for each pair @xmath11 ) .",
    "hence , the triangular and kagom lattices are common frustrated geometries in @xmath12 . in three dimensions , lattices of corner sharing triangles ( garnet structures ) or tetrahedra ( pyrochlore and spinel structures )",
    "are frustrated with nearest neighbor afm interactions .",
    "the pyrochlore lattice has received increased attention recently because the @xmath13 afm model is predicted to be a collective paramagnet , or spin liquid , in the ground state .",
    "@xcite a @xmath14 spin liquid is unusual ,  @xcite but the role of lattice dimensionality appears to be reduced in the face of large quantum fluctuations driven by frustration .",
    "@xcite the stabilization of a non - collinear long - range ordered state is expected when long - range interactions are included ,  @xcite or when constraints arising from single - ion anisotropy are imposed .",
    "@xcite magnetic insulating pyrochlores , general formula a@xmath15b@xmath15o@xmath16 , where a is a rare earth ion ( ho@xmath17 , dy@xmath17 , tb@xmath17 , gd@xmath17 ) , are a subset of frustrated magnets that are at the focus of much experimental and theoretical work.@xcite this family of materials displays long - range order ,  @xcite a novel `` ice like '' phase with residual entropy ,  @xcite and collective paramagnetic behavior at milli - kelvin temperatures .  @xcite the focus of our brief review is the candidate @xmath14 spin liquid tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the many conflicting experimental results and theoretical predictions of this material are discussed , and the recent progress toward a general picture for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  is presented .",
    "the pyrochlore tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  has dominant afm interactions as determined from dc magnetization measurements on a polycrystalline sample , @xmath18k .",
    "@xcite results from muon spin resonance ( @xmath6sr ) clearly indicate dynamic moments down to @xmath19mk despite the development of short - range correlations at approximately @xmath20k , as seen in neutron scattering measurements .",
    "@xcite suppression of an ordering temperature in this material by two orders of magnitude ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) can be understood in the context of a nearest neighbor afm .",
    "however , tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  has a measured spin anisotropy gap of @xmath22k ,  @xcite attributable to crystal field effects , as well as reasonably strong dipolar interactions ,  @xcite that such a large reduction in @xmath23 is quite puzzling .    as a first step to unraveling the mystery of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", one has to determine the single ion properties of tb@xmath17 in the dense material . from experiments and calculations , gingras _",
    "_ find that the tb@xmath17 moment is approximately @xmath24 , a substantial reduction from the free ion result @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite in addition , the crystal field effects on tb@xmath17 ( @xmath26 so @xmath27 ) yield an effective ising ground state level structure with a quantization axis oriented along the local @xmath2  direction ,  @xcite with a gap to the next energy levels , an excited doublet , on the order of @xmath22k . this @xmath2  anisotropy is significant since for afm effective nearest neighbor interactions it greatly reduces the frustration from that of a heisenberg like model .",
    "@xcite with a better grip on the dipolar strength and the crystal field levels , a revised curie - weiss temperature of @xmath28k for the dipoles and exchange is calculated and an ordering temperature of  @xmath29k deduced .",
    "@xcite also , from theoretical work on a dipolar spin ice model ( @xmath2  ising ) one is able to show that for the parameters of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , a long - range ordered state with zero net moment about each tetrahedron ( an all - in all - out state ) is expected at @xmath30k .  @xcite that experiments prove these predictions wrong is possibly due to the effects of long - range exchange beyond nearest - neighbor or quantum fluctuations .    with the single ion properties suggesting a @xmath2  ising dipolar model for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  at @xmath31k , but the absence of any agreement between this model and experiments on an ordering temperature ,",
    "a re - evaluation of the model is necessary .",
    "hence , the focus of the discussion shifts to the paramagnetic ( pm ) regime and the short - range correlations . early inelastic neutron data on a single crystal found evidence for the partial softening of the lowest energy modes about @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "@xcite elastic scattering measurements on a single crystal of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  clearly display diffusive scattering about these same regions in the @xmath34 plane with the strongest correlations centered about @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "@xcite the qualitative features of the structure factor ( @xmath35 ) in the pm phase can be roughly fitted with a near neighbor afm heisenberg model ,  @xcite suggesting that the strict ising anisotropy might not hold for temperatures defining the pm regime of this material , i.e. , @xmath36k .",
    "note , the pm @xmath35 is measured at @xmath37k in gardner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite but at @xmath38k in yasui _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite a relaxation of the @xmath2  spin anisotropy in a long - range dipolar afm pyrochlore model does yield good agreement with the pm @xmath35 in this material for temperatures @xmath39k .",
    "@xcite    recent data for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  in the low temperature regime suggests the existence of a spin glass like state .",
    "hysteresis is observed in the field cooled and zero field cooled neutron scattering data below @xmath40k .",
    "@xcite thermodynamic measurements of the static susceptibility also indicate spin glass physics , albeit at a much lower temperature , @xmath19mk .",
    "@xcite .",
    "hence , at present the general consensus is that tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  remains a collective paramagnet down to @xmath41-@xmath19 mk at ambient pressures . under high pressure , @xmath42 gpa , the material orders at @xmath43k ,  @xcite but",
    "the spin structure is not the @xmath44 all - in all - out structure predicted from a @xmath2  ising model ,  @xcite or the `` nearby '' long - range ordered spin ice state .",
    "@xcite an applied field can also induce an ordered state in this material .",
    "@xcite field driven ordered states is a current topic in the spin ice material dy@xmath15ti@xmath15o@xmath16,@xcite but unlike the spin ice materials moderate field strengths along high symmetry directions indicate weaker spin anisotropy for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite we note that the gap between the ground state doublet and the first excited states in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  is an order of magnitude smaller than the gap measured in the spin ice materials .",
    "the heisenberg afm on the pyrochlore lattice is defined by the simple hamiltonian @xmath45 , where @xmath10 , @xmath46 describes the location of a spin by its fcc lattice position @xmath47 and tetrahedral basis point @xmath48 , and interactions are among nearest neighbors only .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath49 represents a highly frustrated model that produces a spin liquid ground state for quantum spins ( @xmath50 ) @xcite or classical spins ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "@xcite in the classical model , an ordered state can be induced by perturbations arising from exchange interactions beyond nearest neighbor@xcite or by constraints imposed by spin isotropy .",
    "@xcite if the single - ion anisotropy is along the local @xmath2  direction ( i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the local @xmath2  direction and @xmath54 ) , then it is the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic pyrochlore ( nearest neighbor spin ice ) that is frustrated .",
    "@xcite for rare earth magnets like the spin ice materials and tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , long - range dipolar interactions are a significant contribution to the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the basic model for rare earth pyrochlore insulators can be written , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the nearest neighbor dipole strength , @xmath57 , @xmath6 is the moment on the rare earth ion , @xmath58 is the nearest neighbor distance , and @xmath59 is the vector separation between spins @xmath60 and @xmath61 . if the spins in eq .",
    "[ eq - hdip ] are constrained to their local @xmath2  ising axes , then eq .  [ eq - hdip ] represents the dipolar @xmath2  ising model ( dim ) that successfully describes the specific heat @xcite and paramagnetic correlations @xcite of spin ice .",
    "when the dim is simulated by a monte carlo algorithm employing nonlocal loop moves , a first order transition to a spin ice ground state is found ,  @xcite with an ordering wave vector and spin structure in agreement with mean - field calculations .",
    "@xcite    the phase diagram of the dim on the pyrochlore lattice is generated by defining the sign and magnitude of @xmath7 and the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction d.  @xcite the dim exhibits two phases depending on the ratio @xmath62 : for @xmath63 a spin ice manifold results ( macroscopic degeneracy ) , where two spins point in and two spins point out along their local @xmath2  axes for each unit tetrahedron .",
    "for @xmath64 , a non - collinear long - range ordered state results , where all spins about a unit tetrahedron point either in or out along their local @xmath2  axes , this @xmath44 structure is replicated over the lattice .",
    "we note that going from the pm to the @xmath44 state occurs via a second order phase transition , but the path from the pm to spin ice manifold represents a cross over to a dynamically frozen state without long - range order . in the dim",
    ", the temperature of the phase transition or cross over is signalled by the peak in the calculated specific heat , whose position depends on the value of @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite hence , the important energy scale in this model is the effective nearest neighbor exchange , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are geometric factors arising from the inner product of the local @xmath2  spin quantization axes . with @xmath68 for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "the prediction is a @xmath44 state at approximately @xmath29k .",
    "@xcite the subtle point about tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  in the dim is that it sits near the boundary between the two phases , making it susceptible to fine tuning of the model parameters ( exchange or dipolar energy scales and single ion crystal field state wave functions ) .",
    "it is conceivable that tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  might sit close to a line of disorder in the phase diagram where fluctuations dominate and a tendency to order is suppressed .",
    "the simulation of the dim near the phase boundary presents some numerical challenges and is not well understood .",
    "@xcite    as mentioned in section [ sec - expt ] , tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1   does not order at @xmath69k , and suggestions from the pm @xmath70 results @xcite that the @xmath2  ising constraint should be relaxed in this case provides a hint of where to venture next . in considering the symmetry of the dim , one can show that no strict @xmath2  ising model on the pyrochlore lattice can reproduce the short - range correlations observed in experiments , but a model in which the rotational symmetry is partially restored is found to admit a solution compatible with experiments .",
    "@xcite mean - field and monte carlo calculations make these claims more quantitative .",
    "@xcite hence , in the pm regime the physics of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1   can not be ascribed to the same @xmath2  ising interpretation of the moments that works so well for the spin ice materials .",
    "a pitfall with a classical heisenberg description for tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  is that complete restoration of spin isotropy does not agree with experiments and calculations of the single ion properties of the tb@xmath17 .  @xcite the g - tensor of tb@xmath17 in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  exhibits @xmath2  like anisotropy below @xmath71k and a ground state doublet structure that is separated from a first excited doublet by about @xmath72k , which is on the order of the curie - weiss temperature for exchange and dipolar interactions ( @xmath73k ) .",
    "@xcite for the spin orbit coupled tb@xmath17 moments ( @xmath27 ) , the angular momentum for the two lowest lying doublets is predominately @xmath74 for ground state and @xmath75 for the first excited state .",
    "@xcite hence , transverse fluctuations between these two lowest lying doublets are allowed and non - negligible at the temperatures of the @xmath35 experiments , @xmath76-@xmath71k .",
    "@xcite    applying a random phase approximation ( rpa ) to a model with exchange and long - range dipoles , the fluctuations between the lowest lying crystal field states can be studied , i.e. , the @xmath2  ising limit is recovered when transitions between states @xmath77 ( ground state ) and @xmath78 ( first excited state ) have a vanishing matrix element , @xmath79 .",
    "using @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the rpa  @xcite gives excellent semi - quantitative agreement with the pm @xmath35 and the energy dispersion between the low lying magnetic states of the neutron experiments .",
    "@xcite however , the rpa still predicts an ordered state at @xmath43k .",
    "hence , the rpa demonstrates the sensitivity of the pm correlations observed in neutron scattering to quantum fluctuations in this unusual magnetic system ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , but it still gives a @xmath23 of approximately @xmath5k to the above all - in",
    "all - out @xmath44 state .",
    "in order to understand the physics of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  below @xmath5k , we need to go beyond the first order approximation of the rpa and consider quantum effects more rigorously",
    ". a reasonable first step would be to employ a more detailed description of the crystal field states of the tb@xmath17 ion , and then form an effective low energy hamiltonian from the more complicated model following a procedure similar to that used in the derivation of the t - j or heisenberg models from the hubbard model .",
    "experimentally , low temperature neutron scattering ( elastic and inelastic ) measurements on single crystals are needed to probe the fluctuations between crystal field states .",
    "@xcite exploring these same properties but at hydrostatic pressures below @xmath5gpa could provide a valuable link to the high pressure ordered state of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    in conclusion , there is strong evidence that tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  can not be described by a classical @xmath2  ising hamiltonian similar to the successful model of the spin ice materials .",
    "@xcite spin fluctuations must be incorporated into any model of tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1   in order to capture the pm correlations , and a simple description of quantum fluctuations via the rpa is sufficient to achieve good agreement with experiments .",
    "however , to study the lack of an ordering transition in tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 , a more careful treatment of the quantum fluctuations is essential . finally , we come back to the @xmath2  ising dipolar model phase diagram and note that tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  is very close to the afm / spin ice phase boundary .",
    "@xcite there may be issues with the quantum fluctuations , long - range exchange , microscopic disorder at very low temperatures , or tuning of material or model parameters that places tb@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1  on a line or region of disordered semi - classial ground states .",
