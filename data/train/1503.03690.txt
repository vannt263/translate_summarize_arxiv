    "@xcite , have been greatest obstacle since slater - type orbitals have no simple addition theorem ; relations for products of two slater - type orbitals centered on different positions not available in compact form @xcite .",
    "the slater - type orbitals are obtained by simplification of laguerre functions in hydrogen@xmath3like orbitals @xcite by keeping only the term of the highest power of @xmath12 , for integer values of principal quantum number @xmath11 ( istos ) , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and it has been proved that they provide extra flexibility for closer variational description of atoms and molecules by considering the values of @xmath11 in more general set of number , namely positive real numbers ( nstos ) , where @xmath7 .",
