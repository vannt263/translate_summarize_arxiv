    "the finite size expressions , which can be regarded as a generalization of the rummukainen - gottlieb s formulae to the generic two - particle system in the moving frame , are developed .",

    "( [ det-1dim ] ) and our strict discussion of this formula from theoretical aspects , now it will be possible to compute the resonance masses and perhaps its decay widths of some resonances including possible exotic hadrons as well as traditional hadrons like @xmath2 and vector kaon @xmath4 , etc .",
