    "the bulk of galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) is largely thought to be accelerated at the shock waves associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) through the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) .",
    "a key feature of this mechanism is that the acceleration rate is proportional to the particle charge .",
    "this property is especially appealing if one tries to explain the structure of the knee in the cr spectrum : if we assume that the maximum energy of accelerated particles scales with the charge of the particles involved , a knee arises naturally as a superposition of spectra of chemicals with different nuclear charges @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this result is based on the assumption that nuclei are completely ionized during the acceleration . on the other hand when ions are injected into the acceleration process",
    "they are unlikely to be fully stripped , especially if of high nuclear charge",
    ".    the atoms relevant for the injection are those present in the circumstellar medium where the forward shock propagates .",
    "the temperature of this plasma varies from @xmath2 k if the snr expands into the regular ism , up to @xmath3 k if the expansion occurs into the bubble created by the progenitor s wind .",
    "if @xmath4 k even hydrogen is not fully ionized , as demonstrated by the presence of balmer lines associated with shocks in some young snrs @xcite .",
    "for @xmath5 only atoms up to @xmath6 can be completely ionized @xcite .",
    "the typical assumption made in the literature is that atoms lose all electrons in the atomic orbitals soon after the beginning of the acceleration process , namely that the ionization time needed to strip all the electrons is much smaller than the acceleration time . in spite of this assumption in @xcite",
    "we showed that , for a typical snr shock , the ionization time is comparable with the acceleration time , hence electrons are stripped when ions already move relativistically .",
    "this fact has two important consequences : 1 ) the maximum energy of ions can be reduced with respect to the standard prediction of dsa and 2 ) the ejected electrons can easily start the acceleration process because they already move relativistically .    the possibility that ionization can provide a source of relativistic electrons is especially relevant because the question of how electrons are injected into the dsa is still an unsolved issue .",
    "dsa applies only for particles with a larmor radius larger than the typical shock thickness , which is of the order of larmor radius of the shocked downstream thermal ions .",
    "the injection condition can be easily fulfilled for supra - thermal protons which reside in the highest energy tail of the maxwellian distribution .",
    "the injection of heavier ions is , in principle , even easier than that of protons in that their larmor radius is larger assuming they have the same proton temperature ( which could be not the case ) . on the other hand",
    "the same argument tells that electrons can not be injected from the thermal bath because , even if we assume equilibration between electrons and protons , the larmor radius of electrons is a factor @xmath7 smaller than that of protons .",
    "only electrons which are already relativistic can cross the shock and start the dsa .",
    "most proposed solutions to the electron injection problem involve some kind of pre acceleration mechanism driven by plasma instabilities able to accelerate thermal electrons up to mildly relativistic energy . for instance",
    "@xcite showed that magnetosonic turbulence excited by a beam of reflected ions ahead of the shock can accelerate electrons along the magnetic field lines thanks to their cerenkov interaction with excited waves .",
    "other studies predict that electrons can be effectively preaccelerated by self - generated whistler waves @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite showed that efficient electron acceleration can happen in perpendicular shocks due to `` shock surfing '' of electrons on electrostatic waves excited by buneman instability at the leading edge of the shock foot . a different mechanism proposed by @xcite , can take place in quasi - perpendicular shocks and is driven by the presence of oblique whistler waves excited by the returning ions in the shock foot .",
    "the study of these electromagnetic pre - acceleration mechanisms can be only performed using numerical techniques which showed that the fraction of injected electrons strongly depend on the values of initial conditions ( like magnetic field strength and orientation ) and are difficult to apply to realistic cases .    in this paper",
    "we investigate in detail the process of ionization applied to the acceleration of heavy ions , presenting the full steady - state solution for shock acceleration in the test particle approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : time ] we compare the acceleration time of ions with the ionization time due both to photo - ionization and to coulomb scattering showing that the former dominates on the latter . in ",
    "[ sec : e_max ] we use the linear acceleration theory to compute the maximum energy achieved by different chemical specie when the ionization process is taken into account . in  [ sec : spectra ] we compute the distribution function of both ions and electrons in the framework of linear acceleration theory including the term due to ionization . we conclude in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we show that the ionization of different chemical species occurs during the acceleration process on a timescale which is comparable with the acceleration time needed to achieve relativistic energies .",
    "we also show that the ionization due to coulomb collision is generally negligible compared with the photo - ionization due to the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "let us consider atoms of a single chemical specie @xmath8 with nuclear charge @xmath9 and mass @xmath10 , which start the dsa with initial charge @xmath11 and momentum @xmath12 .",
    "we want to compute which is the ionization time needed to lose one electron , changing the net charge from @xmath13 to @xmath14 and which is the momentum @xmath15 that ions reach when ionization occurs .    for simplicity",
    "we compute the acceleration time in the framework of linear shock acceleration theory for plane shock geometry : i.e. we assume that during the ionization time needed to strip one single electron , the shock structure does not change . if a particle with momentum @xmath15 diffuses with a diffusion coefficient @xmath16 , the well know expression for the acceleration time is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the plasma speed in the shock rest frame , and the subscript 1 ( 2 ) refers to the upstream ( downstream ) quantities ( note that @xmath19 ) .",
    "the downstream plasma speed is related to the upstream one through the compression factor @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "we limit our considerations to strong shocks , which have compression factor @xmath22 , and we assume bohm diffusion coefficient , i.e. @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the particle speed and @xmath25 is the larmor radius . the turbulent magnetic field responsible for the particle diffusion",
    "is assumed to be compressed downstream according to @xmath26 .",
    "even if this relation applies only for the magnetic component parallel to the shock plane , such assumption does not affect strongly our results .",
    "it is useful to define the instantaneous acceleration time as @xmath27 . using all previous assumptions @xmath28",
    "can be expressed as follows : @xmath29 here the upstream magnetic field is expressed in @xmath30 g and the shock speed is @xmath31 .",
    "notice that , when @xmath32 and @xmath18 are assumed constant , @xmath33 reduces to @xmath28 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 . to compute the energy reached by particles when the ionization event occurs , eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_acc2 ] ) has to be compared with the ionization time scale .",
    "ionization can occur either via coulomb collisions with thermal particles or via photo - ionization with background photons .",
    "whether the former process dominates on the latter depends on the ism number density compared to the ionizing photon density . in the following",
    "we show that photo - ionization dominates when snrs are young and expand in a typical ism .    as soon as the ions start the dsa , the photo - ionization can occur only when the energy of background photons , @xmath36 , as seen in the ion rest frame , is larger than the ionization energy @xmath37 .",
    "atoms moving relativistically with a lorentz factor @xmath38 see a distribution of photons peaked in the forward direction of motion , with a mean photon energy @xmath39 .",
    "the photo - ionization cross section can be estimated using the simplest approximation for the @xmath40-shell cross section of hydrogen - like atoms with effective nuclear charge @xmath13 , i.e. @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the thompson cross section and @xmath43 is the fine structure constant and @xmath44 is the ionization energy threshold for the ground state of the chemical specie @xmath8 with @xmath45 electrons .",
    "the numerical values of @xmath44 can be found in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite for elements up to @xmath46 ) . to get the full photo - ionization time we need to integrate over the total photon energy spectrum , i.e. : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the photon spectrum as seen in the plasma rest frame . because the photo - ionization cross section decreases rapidly with increasing photon energy , for a fixed ion speed the relevant ionizing photons are only those with energy close to the threshold , i.e. @xmath49 , measured in the plasma frame .",
    "the corresponding numerical value is : @xmath50 we assume that the maximum possible acceleration time is equal to the sedov - taylor time , @xmath51 , corresponding to the end of the free expansion phase . comparing @xmath51 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ph_time2 ] ) , we see that the photons which can be relevant for ionization are only those with a number density @xmath52 . for this reason we can neglect the high energy radiation coming from the remnant itself because the typical number density of the x - ray photons is less than @xmath53 ph/@xmath54 .",
    "an important consequence of the photo - ionization is that electrons are stripped from the atoms with a kinetic energy @xmath55 as measured in the atom rest frame .",
    "hence , if the parent atoms move relativistically in the plasma rest frame , electrons move with the same lorentz factor and the same direction of the parent atoms .",
    "this property will be used in  [ sec : spectra ] to simplify the calculation of electrons spectrum .",
    "now we consider the ionization of accelerated ions due to coulomb collisions with protons and electrons of the thermal plasma .",
    "we neglect the thermal energy of those particles and we consider the process in the ion s rest frame .",
    "the role of collisions is mainly relevant during the very initial stage of acceleration , namely when the kinetic energy of incident particle , @xmath56 , is close to the ionization energy , @xmath37 , as seen in the ion s rest frame .",
    "this is a consequence of the shape of ionization cross section which has a peak value for @xmath57 and rapidly decreases for larger energies .",
    "a good upper limit for the peak value of the cross section is provided by the classical ( non relativistic ) thomson approach @xcite , which gives a maximum for @xmath58 equal to : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the bohr radius , @xmath61 is the ionization energy expressed in rydberg unity and @xmath62 is the number of electrons in the atomic orbital considered . for larger energies the thomson cross section decreases like @xmath63 while the asymptotic behavior predicted by the quantum mechanics",
    "is @xmath64 .",
    "this implies that the collisional ionization time has a minimum for @xmath65 and than increases .",
    "in order to get this minimum value one must average the contribution of collisions in the upstream and downstream region . assuming equal density for thermal protons and electrons @xmath66 ,",
    "the result is @xcite : @xmath67^{-1 }     = 0.0024 \\ , i_{\\rm ryd}^2 \\left ( \\frac{n_1}{\\rm cm^{-3}}\\right)^{-1 }      \\ , { \\rm yr } \\ , .",

    "the acceleration time increases only like @xmath68 . as a consequence",
    "the collisional ionization can occur only if the acceleration time needed to have @xmath69 is larger than @xmath70 .",

    "notice that we neglected collisions with atoms heavier than hydrogen : such contribution could reduce the ionization time by less than a factor 2 , hence are main conclusions remain valid .",
    "now , in order to understand the relevance of collisions in the relativistic regime we can use the asymptotic bethe cross section valid in the limit @xmath76 , @xcite . the relativistic formulation of this cross section for the total ionization is often written as @xcite : @xmath77 \\ , .",

    "we show @xmath91 using the isrf in the galactic center ( lower dashed line ) and the one at 12 kpc far away from the galactic center in the galactic plane ( upper dashed lines ) . finally with dot - dashed lines we plot the collisional ionization time for the upstream density @xmath92 :",

    "the process of ionization can affect the maximum energy that nuclei achieve during the acceleration , especially those with large nuclear charge .",
    "it is worth stressing that the knowledge of the maximum energy is intimately connected with two important aspects of the cr spectrum : the interpretation of the _ knee _ structure and the transition region from galactic to extragalactic component .",
    "the _ knee _ is commonly interpreted as due to the superposition of the spectra of all chemicals with different cutoff energies . using the flux of different components measured at low energies",
    "it has been shown that the knee structure is well reproduced if one assumes that the maximum energy of each specie @xmath101 is proportional to the nuclear charge @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the superposition of subsequent cutoff seems to be confirmed by the measurements of the spectrum of single components in the knee region : data presented by the kascade experiments show that the maximum energy of he is @xmath102 times larger than that of the protons @xcite . from the theoretical point of view the relation @xmath103",
    "is clearly predicted by dsa if one assume that the diffusion coefficient is rigidity - dependent . on the other hand",
    "this is correct only provided that during the acceleration process nuclei are completely ionized otherwise the maximum energy is proportional to the effective charge of the ions rather that to their nuclear charge .",
    "now , the maximum energy is thought to be achieved at the beginning of the sedov - taylor phase ( @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "for later times , @xmath104 , the shock speed decreases faster than the diffusion velocity , hence particles at the maximum energy can escape from the accelerator and the maximum energy can not increase further .",
    "it is worth noting that the process of escaping is not completely understood in that it strongly depends on the turbulence produced by the same escaping particles and on the damping mechanisms of the turbulence itself @xcite .",
    "anyway here we assume that the maximum energy , @xmath105 , is achieved at @xmath106 .",
    "if the total ionization time is comparable , or even larger than @xmath51 , we do expect that @xmath107 , where we call @xmath108 the maximum energy achieved by ions which are completely ionized since the beginning of acceleration .",
    "a consistent treatment of the ionization effects would require the use of time - dependent calculation .",
    "however our aim is to get a first order approximation of the effect of ionization .",
    "this can be achieved using the quasi - stationary version of the linear acceleration theory .    in order to compute @xmath105",
    "the first piece of information we need is the initial ionization level of ions . in the case of volatile elements , which exist mainly in the gas - phase ,",
    "the level of ionization is easy to estimate being only a function of the plasma temperature : ions are ionized up to a level such that the ionization energy is of the same order of the kinetic energy of thermal electrons as seen in the ion s rest frame . on the other hand refractory elements",
    "are largely locked into solid dust grains .",
    "this occurs both in the regular ism as well as in stellar winds . as claimed by @xcite",
    "there are evidences that elements condensed in dust grains are efficiently injected into the dsa thanks to the fact that dust grains can be easily accelerated up to energies where the grains start to be sputtered .",
    "a non negligible fraction of the atoms expelled by sputtering are energetic enough to start the dsa . in this scenario",
    "the ionization level of ejected atoms is very difficult to predict in that depends on the structure of the grains .",
    "however a reasonable assumption could be that ions preserve all the electrons in the inner shells which are not shared in the orbitals of the crystal structure of the grains .",
    "moreover , as noted by @xcite , if the ejected ion is highly ionized its electron affinity is strong and electron - exchange with the atoms of thermal plasma could reduce the level of ionization up to the equilibrium one .",
    "for these reasons , in the following calculation , we neglect the complication arising from the dust sputtering process and we assume that the level of ionization is only determined by the plasma temperature .",
    "let us consider a single ion injected with momentum @xmath109 and total charge @xmath110 .",
    "the ion undergoes acceleration at a constant rate @xmath111 during a time equal to the ionization time needed to lose one electron , @xmath112 , when it achieves the momentum @xmath113 .",
    "notice that we include only the photo - ionization because , as we saw in the previous paragraph , for typical density of the external medium around the snr ( @xmath114 ) , the coulomb collisions can be neglected .",
    "in order to compute simultaneously @xmath115 and @xmath113 we have to equate the acceleration time with the ionization time : @xmath116 the last equality holds because we use bohm diffusion and because we assume that the shock velocity and the magnetic field both remain constant during @xmath112 .",
    "moreover we saw that the photo - ionization occurs when ions already move relativistically , hence using eq .",

    "( [ eq : p2_sol ] ) repeatedly for all subsequent ionization steps , we get the momentum when the ionization is complete . if the total ionization time , @xmath124 , is smaller than the sedov time , in order to get the maximum momentum we need to add the further acceleration during the time @xmath125 .",
    "the final expression for the maximum momentum can be written as follows : @xmath126 where we neglected the contribution of @xmath109 .",
    "the last term has been written as a sum over @xmath127 time - steps in order to handle the case where magnetic field and shock speed change with time .",
    "now we can quantify the effect of ionization in the determination of @xmath128 .",
    "the simplest approximation we can do is to assume @xmath129 and @xmath32 constant during the free expansion phase , i.e. up to @xmath106 . in order to estimate @xmath51 we consider two different situations which can represent a typical type i / a and a core - collapse supernovae . in the first case the supernova explodes in the regular ism with typical density and temperature @xmath130 @xmath54 and @xmath131 k. on the other hand snrs generated by very massive stars",

    "the average shock speed during the free expansion phase is @xmath138 km / s in both cases .",
    "it is worth stressing that if one would consider a more realistic scenario for core - collapse sne it is important to take into account the type of the progenitor and its wind , in order to provide a better estimate of the ejected mass and of the bubble s dimension and density .",
    "these parameters strongly affect the value of @xmath51 , which determines how effective is the ionization in reducing the maximum energy : indeed for @xmath139 yr the role of ionization becomes negligible , as we see below .",
    "the last parameter we need is the magnetic field strength .",
    "we stress that our aim is only to estimate the effect of ionization in the scenario where the snrs indeed produce the observed crs spectrum and the _ knee _ is interpreted as the superposition of a rigidity - dependent cutoff of different species . for this reason",

    "it is worth noting that nonlinear effects can also result in the opposite situation with @xmath166 , as we will show below .",
    "a key ingredient of the dsa is the speed of the magnetic turbulence which is responsible for particles scattering .",
    "the speed of the scattering centers contributes to the determination of the effective compression ratio felt by particles which , in turns , determines the spectral slope .",
    "the typical speed of the turbulence is of the order of alfvn speed which , when is computed in the background magnetic field , is of the order of few tens km / s and it is negligible with respect to the shock speed . on the other hand if one assume that turbulence moves with the alfvn speed computed in the amplified magnetic field , as shown by @xcite , it can not be neglected and the resulting slope can be @xmath167 .",
    "if this happens the value of @xmath157 drops and the number of electrons produced via ionization is maybe insufficient in order to explain the synchrotron emission .",
    "a final comment concerns the mechanism of electrons injection in core - collapse snrs . the value of @xmath157 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kep ] has been computed using the ionization level of chemical elements in a plasma with @xmath168 .",
    "we recall that the type i / a snrs expand in the warm ism , where the typical temperature is around @xmath2 k hence we expect the injection of electrons to be relevant . on the other hand core - collapse snrs",
    "expands into a diluted bubble whose temperature reach @xmath3 k @xcite , hence the degree of ionization of atoms is higher and the number of electrons available for the injection is smaller ( see e.g. @xcite ) . using @xmath169",
    "we estimate that @xmath157 is a factor @xmath170 smaller than the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kep ] . on the other hand in those bubbles",
    "the metallicity is estimated to be greater than the ism mean value @xcite .",
    "hence , even for core - collapse snrs the electron injection through ionization could play a relevant role .",
    "in this work we include for the first time the ionization process of heavy ions in the theory of dsa at snr shocks .",
    "we showed that , for the typical environments where snrs propagate , the photo - ionization due to the isrf dominates on the collisional ionization and produces two important effects : 1 ) the reduction of the maximum energy achieved by ions and 2 ) the production of a relativistic population of electrons .",
    "\\(1 ) the first effect is especially important for the interpretation of the knee structure in the all particle spectrum of crs .",
    "the change of slope on the two sides of the knee is generally interpreted as due to the superposition of spectra of chemicals with different nuclear charges combined with their abundances and convolved with the rigidity dependent diffusion in the galaxy .",
    "an important requirement for a good fit to the knee is that the cutoff energy of each specie , from hydrogen up to iron , should be proportional to the nuclear charge , @xmath9 .",
    "it is generally assumed that dsa can accelerate ions up to a maximum energy proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "this assumption is valid only if the ionization time needed to strip all electrons from atomic orbitals , @xmath124 , is much shorter than the acceleration time .",
    "we assume that the maximum possible acceleration time is equal to the sedov - taylor time , @xmath51 , corresponding to the end of the free expansion phase . using a simple steady - state approach we showed that , especially for very massive ions , @xmath124 can be comparable to or even larger than @xmath51 , depending on the type of the remnant and on its location in the galaxy .",
    "in fact the isrf responsible for the photo - ionization decreases for increasing distance from the galactic center .",
    "we analyze two different cases which are representative of a type i / a and a core - collapse snrs .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "snrs of type i / a are generally unable to accelerate ions according to @xmath103 because @xmath51 does not exceed the typical value of 500 yr . the only exception are the remnants located in the galactic bulge where the photon field is strong enough to reduce the photo - ionization time to a value much shorter than @xmath51 .",
    "the situation for core - collapse snrs is different because their typical sedov time is @xmath171 yr hence the ionization time for chemicals up to iron can be neglected and the maximum energy is indeed proportional to the nuclear charge , with the exception of those remnant located very far away from the galactic center where the isrf is very low .",
    "previous conclusions are based on the assumption that during the free expansion phase both the magnetic field and the shock velocity remain constant .",
    "this is indeed a poor approximation .",
    "in fact during the free expansion phase the shock speed can vary by a factor of few ( depending on the velocity profile of the ejecta and on the density profile of the external medium ) .",
    "now for dsa the acceleration rate is proportional to @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the turbulent magnetic field generated by the cr induced instabilities ( resonant or non - resonant ) , which is an increasing function of the shock velocity .",
    "hence the acceleration rate can significantly change during the free expansion phase even if @xmath129 varies only by a factor of few .",
    "always in the framework of steady - state approximation , we develop a simple toy model able to include the magnetic field amplification and the time evolution of the remnant . using this toy model we showed that the magnetic amplification and time evolution can significantly reduce the acceleration time with respect to @xmath51 and , as a consequence , the maximum energy achieved by heavy ions becomes smaller than the previous estimate : the relation @xmath174 can be achieved up to iron nuclei only by snrs with a sedov time @xmath175 yr which means that the mass ejecta should be @xmath176 .",
    "clearly the same mechanism also applies to ions heavier then fe . their maximum energy can not be much larger than that achieved by fe itself unless the acceleration occurs in very massive snrs .",
    "hence the ionization mechanism put severe limitation to the possibility that ultra heavier ions can contribute to the cr spectrum in the transition region between galactic and extragalactic component .",
    "\\(2 ) the second effect concerning the production of relativistic electrons was already put forward in @xcite .",
    "the ionization mechanism provides a source for the injection of relativistic electrons into the dsa mechanism .",
    "we investigate the possibility that those electrons can be responsible for the synchrotron radiation observed from young snrs . in order to estimate the total number of injected electrons we use a semi - analytical technique to solve the steady - state transport equation which describe the electron distribution function in the shock region . summing the contributions coming from the ionization of all chemicals we showed that the ratio between accelerated electrons and protons is @xmath177 .",
    "this value is especially appealing because corresponds to the right order of magnitude required in order to explain the synchrotron emission if the magnetic field is amplified up to few hundreds @xmath30 g .",
    "interestingly such magnetic field amplification is consistently predicted by non linear acceleration theory as a consequence of the back reaction of accelerated particles onto the shock dynamics .",
    "several effects can modify our prediction for the number of electrons .",
    "the estimate @xmath177 is obtained using test particle approximation and adopting the abundances of cr spectrum observed at the earth corrected for the effect of propagation in the galaxy .",
    "even if we did not develop a fully nonlinear approach , we showed how nonlinear effects can substantially modify the electron / proton ratio .",
    "indeed the value of @xmath157 strongly depends on the spectral slope as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : k_ep ] ) .",
    "nonlinear dsa usually predicts steeper spectra than the test particle result , @xmath158 , and this translates into an enhancement of @xmath157 . on the other hand also the opposite situation can be realized .",
    "indeed some authors pointed out that , if the magnetic field amplification occurs , the velocity of the magnetic turbulence with respect to the plasma can be much larger than the alfvn speed corresponding to the background magnetic field .",
    "if this occurs the spectral slope of the accelerated particles be appreciably softer than 4 and the electron / proton ratio would drop to a value which is insufficient to explain the observed synchrotron radiation .    in order to get a correct determination of @xmath157 for a single snr , other effects should be taken into account : @xmath178 ) the chemical composition of the environment where the snr expands , @xmath179 ) the initial ionization state of each chemicals and @xmath180 ) a realistic model for the ions injection .",
    "a further complication directly related to the previous points is the fact that many heavy elements are condensed in solid dust grains both in the ism as well as in the stellar wind .",
    "it has been pointed out that the injection of refractory elements into the dsa can be dominated by the sputtering of these dust grains rather than by the injection of single atoms from the thermal bath @xcite . in this picture a correct computation of the number of injected ions and their initial ionization state is very challenging .    as a finally remark we want to stress that the electron / proton ratio in a single source , what we call @xmath157 , is different from the same ratio measured from the cr spectrum at earth , which is @xmath181 at 1 tev @xcite .",
    "sometimes these quantities are assumed to be the same . conversely they could be different because the latter is the sum of the contribution coming from all sources integrated during the source age , and also reflect transport to earth and losses in transport . especially relevant is the fact that other sources like pulsar wind nebulae can significantly contribute to the electron flux measured at earth , but not to the proton flux .",
    "moreover the value of @xmath157 in a single source can vary during the source age .",
    "different mechanisms of electron injection , other than the ionization , can be relevant in different phases of the remnant .",
