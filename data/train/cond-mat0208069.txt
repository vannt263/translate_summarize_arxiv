    "the current flowing through this system will be obtained by first finding the time - dependent scattering states , and then using them to obtain the current .",

    "the first - order of this expansion yields the ` adiabatic approximation'.@xcite this expansion procedure necessitates that the characteristic inverse time - constant , @xmath9 , which describes the time dependence of the modulating potential , will be smaller than any characteristic energy scale of the electrons .",

    "here we investigate the turnstile pump , and in particular focus on the correlation between resonant transmission and the magnitude of adiabatically pumped charge .",
    "this correlation has been pointed out by levinson _",
    "et al._@xcite and by wei _",
    "et al._@xcite the idea may be summarized generically as follows.@xcite consider a quantum dot , connected to its external leads by two point contacts , whose conductances are controlled by split - gate voltages which are modulated periodically in time . during each cycle",
    "the system follows a closed curve , the ` pumping contour ' , in the parameter plane spanned by the point contact conductances .",
    "as the system parameters are varied ( for example , the gate voltage on the dot ) the pumping contour distorts and shifts , forming a lissajous curve in the parameter plane .",
    "the pumped charge will be ( almost ) quantized when the pumping contour encircles transmission peak(s ) ( that is , resonances ) of the quantum dot in that parameter plane .",
    "its magnitude ( in units of the electronic charge , @xmath4 ) and sign are determined by the winding number of the pumping contour .",
    "this connection between resonant transmission and pumping may be explored by studying a simple model . employing the tight - binding description , we imagine the quantum dot to be coupled to semi - infinite 1d ( single - channel ) leads by matrix elements @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "those are oscillating in time with frequency @xmath25 , such that the modulation amplitude is p and the phase shift between the @xmath54 modulation and that of @xmath55 is @xmath56 , @xmath57 the point contact conductances are then given ( in dimensionless units ) by x@xmath58 and x@xmath59 .",
    "as the couplings of the quantum dot to the leads are modulated in time , @xmath54 and @xmath55 can attain both negative and positive values .",
    "this reflects a modulation of the potential shaping the dot : the tight - binding parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 , which are derived as integrals over the site ` atomic ' wave functions and the oscillating potential , can have both signs .",
    "the extreme modulation arises for @xmath62 , when the hopping matrix elements which couple the dot to the leads oscillate in the range @xmath63-p , p@xmath64 .",
    "the conductances of the point contacts are then modulated in the range @xmath630,p@xmath65 .",
    "the corresponding lissajous curve of the pumping is then a simple closed curve .",
    "another possibility is to keep the couplings finite at any time , i.e. , @xmath66 , and to modulate the couplings around this value . in that case",
    "the lissajous curve may fold on itself [ compare figs . 2 and 3 below ] .",
    "this yields a rather rich behavior of the pumped charge .",
    "the quantum dot is modeled by a ` bunch ' of tight - binding sites connected among themselves . for simplicity , we take the latter in the form of a finite chain of @xmath67 sites , each having the on - site energy @xmath68 , and attached to its nearest - neighbor with a transfer amplitude @xmath69 .",
    "this structure is connected to electronic reservoirs by two 1d chains of sites , whose on - site energies vanish , and whose nearest - neighbor transfer amplitudes are denoted by @xmath70 .",
    "the fermi energy of an electron of wave vector @xmath71 moving on the leads is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the lattice constant .    in the adiabatic approximation ,",

    "these are easily derived .",
    "one writes those states in terms of the instantaneous reflection ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) and transmission ( @xmath78 ) amplitudes : for the scattering state incited by a free wave incoming from the left one has @xmath79 $ ] on the left lead , and @xmath80 on the right lead , with @xmath81 .",

    "one finds that , as function of the modulating amplitude , ( or alternatively the gate voltage on the dot ) , the pumped charge can vary as depicted , for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "= 7truecm    we next make the correspondence between the ` quantized ' values of @xmath0 , as portrayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and the location of the pumping contour relative to the resonant transmission of the quantum dot .",
    "the transmission coefficient of our system , t=@xmath91 , is [ see eq .",

    "clearly , one has t=1 when x@xmath94 and z=0 . for @xmath95 , these equations give two points on the diagonal in the \\{x@xmath96x@xmath97 plane .",
    "the maxima of t , when either x@xmath98 or x@xmath99 is varied while the other parameter is kept fixed , occur on two ` resonance lines ' , shown in thick lines in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "the figures also show the topology of the curve traversed by the system during the pumping cycle for representative values of p. in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have p=1 . the pumping contour encloses a small part of the upper resonance line , and also touches the peak on the lower resonance line .",
    "indeed , q has an intermediate value near @xmath100 , decreasing to zero as p moves away from 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "= 5truecm    increasing the amplitude to the value p=5 reveals that the pumping contour encloses both peaks on the resonance lines , and therefore their separate contributions almost cancel one another , leading to a tiny value of q. also , the pumping curve begins to fold on itself , giving rise to the ` bubble ' close to the origin ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . following the increase of that bubble as p",
    "is enhanced leads to the situation in which the bubble encloses the lower resonance , and then the charge attains a unit value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as the bubble increases further , capturing the two resonance lines , q again becomes very small .",
    "but upon further increasing p , we reach the interesting situation , depicted in fig . 3 for p=8 , in which the bubble encircles _ twice _ the upper resonance line , leading to a pumped charge very close to @xmath101 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "= 3truecm    , , = 3truecm    thus , the condition for obtaining integral values of the pumped charge is that the contour traversed by the system in the parameter plane spanned by the pumping parameters should encircle a significant portion of a resonance line in that plane .",
    "the magnitude and the sign of the pumped charge are determined by that portion , and by the direction along which the resonance line is encompassed .",
    "we emphasize that the pumping contour , as well as the resonance lines , can be determined experimentally.@xcite    the reason for this topological description of adiabatic charge pumping can be traced back to the expression for the pumped charge , eq .",
    "( [ charge ] ) .",
    "the main contribution to the temporal integration there comes from the poles of the integrand .",
    "the same poles are also responsible for the resonant states of the nanostructure , that is , for the maxima in the transmission coefficient.@xcite one can imagine more complex scenarios : including higher harmonics of @xmath25 in the time dependence of the point contact conductances can create more complex lissajous contours , which might encircle portions of the resonance lines more times , yielding higher quantized values of the pumped charge .",
    "modulation of the potential acting on a nanostructure may be also achieved through the piezoelectric effect of surface acoustic waves ( saw s ) , which is relatively large in gaas . in the two - dimensional electron gas formed in gaas - algaas samples",
    "the potential created by the saw is screened out . however , the saw s are effective within a quasi - one - dimensional channel ( where screening is diminished ) defined in gaas - algaas samples . in the experiments,@xcite the time - average current exhibits steps between plateaus , at quantized values of integer@xmath102 , ( @xmath103 is the saw frequency ) , as function of either the gate voltage on the quantum channel , or the saw amplitude .",
    "here we propose an explanation for this observation , in terms of interference of non - interacting electrons.@xcite    unlike the turnstile - like case , the piezoelectric potential , @xmath104p@xmath105 , generated by the saw oscillates with time everywhere inside the nanostructure .",
    "the induced average current ( in the absence of bias ) , flows in the direction of the saw wave vector , @xmath106 .",
    "a realistic treatment of the experimental geometry@xcite only allowed a calculation at low saw amplitude , p , yielding @xmath107p@xmath108 .",
    "the screening of the piezoelectric potential in the wide banks of the channel is also difficult to treat exactly . in view of this",
    "it is useful to gain insight into the phenomenon by applying a simple model:@xcite a 1d channel , connected to 1d leads .",
    "the fermi energy of an electron moving on the leads is then again given by ( [ fermi ] ) , while the ` channel ' hamiltonian is @xmath109 with @xmath110 inside the channel , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , @xmath113 for the ` contacts ' with the leads . the electric field generated by the saw s",
    "@xmath114 \\label{eps}\\ ] ] acts only inside the channel .",
    "( effects due to gradual screening , or reflections from the channel ends , can be incorporated as well.@xcite ) here @xmath24 represents the gate voltage and p@xmath115 , so that @xmath116 has a maximum ( minimum ) in the center of the channel @xmath117 at @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the adiabatic approximation seems to be particularly adequate for saw frequencies , as @xmath120 is small compared to the relevant electronic energy scales .",
    "we hence use ( [ charge ] ) , with @xmath121 there replaced by @xmath122 .",
    "the required instantaneous scattering states are straightforwardly found ; the resulting expression can be put in the form@xcite @xmath123 where the ( time - dependent ) matrix @xmath124 is given by @xmath125 using the same notations , the instantaneous transmission coefficient of the quantum channel reads t@xmath126 .",
    "this has maxima , as function of @xmath127 , at the @xmath67 poles of @xmath128 , i.e. at the zeroes of @xmath129 .",
    "the time - averaged transmission , @xmath130 thus exhibits peaks wherever such poles occur within the period @xmath131 .",
    "similarly , @xmath0 will have singularities whenever @xmath132 comes close to a zero of @xmath133 within the integration . for small @xmath134 , these poles have small imaginary parts , and @xmath0 exhibits large changes as @xmath135 passes near such a pole .",
    "these steps occur exactly where @xmath136 has spikes , originating from the same poles .",
    "thus , again , we find an intimate relation between ` quantized ' values of the pumped charge , and resonant transmission .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows @xmath137 _ vs. _ @xmath24 , for @xmath138 at zero temperature .",
    "the other parameters used are : @xmath139 , p@xmath140 , @xmath141 , and the saw wave length is taken to be 4 times the channel length . several plateaus",
    "are clearly observed , with @xmath137 very close to an integer , @xmath142 .",
    "( we have found that , quite generally , the number @xmath5 of sharp plateaus is up to @xmath143 , with possibly several additional rounded peaks or spikes . ) the steps , at @xmath144 , between these plateaus appear to be equidistant.@xcite for large @xmath67 @xmath145 with @xmath146 , that is , as the saw amplitude p increases , the steps move outwards and broaden , in apparently accordance with experiments.@xcite    = 6truecm    obviously , a finite pumped charge requires finite saw amplitude p. indeed , the steps become rounded as p , @xmath147 or @xmath148 decreases with the rounding beginning at the larger @xmath5 s ; the plateaus at @xmath149 disappear last .",
    "these results remain robust@xcite over a wide range of @xmath150 and @xmath151 , provided @xmath152 ; as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the effects of increasing @xmath151 and @xmath153 . as eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) implies , the staircase structure of @xmath0 is also obtained as function of p , at fixed @xmath24 : @xmath0 remains very small up to p@xmath154 , exhibits @xmath155 steps , at intervals @xmath156 ( which now increases with @xmath157 ) , and then decreases gradually towards zero .",
    "thus , both @xmath24 and p can be used for on - off switching of the pumped current .",
    "= 7truecm    as mentioned above , the steps in @xmath0 are correlated with the spikes of the averaged transmission .",
    "it is interesting to follow these poles as function of the various parameters .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] depicts the partial charge @xmath158 , resulting from integration of ( [ int ] ) only up to @xmath159 , at different values of the gate voltage .",
    "as @xmath24 increases through the first step at @xmath160 , @xmath158 suddenly exhibits a step from zero to one , which appears at @xmath118 . upon further increasing @xmath24 , this step moves to the left , and at @xmath161 , a new step ( from @xmath162 to @xmath5 ) enters at @xmath118 ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "afterwards , there begin to enter steps of @xmath163 , until at @xmath164 there are exactly @xmath155 steps of @xmath165 followed by @xmath155 steps of @xmath163 , yielding @xmath166(the center panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . a similar build - up of ( negative ) steps occurs starting from positive @xmath24-values which are then decreased , ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "thus , unlike the coulomb blockade picture , in which @xmath5 electrons move together , carried by a single minimum of the moving potential , in the interference description , @xmath158 changes by discrete steps of 1 , implying separate motion of the electrons , building up to @xmath5 after a full period .",
    "the step - like time dependence of @xmath158 implies the appearance of higher harmonics in @xmath25 , with amplitudes exhibiting staircase structure as well.@xcite apparently , this will not be true in coulomb - blockade - type description .",
    "measurements of the induced current noise for the @xmath167 plateaus may be useful to distinguish between the simultaneous motion of @xmath5 electrons , and the single electron steps.@xcite    to conclude this section , we note that even within this simple 1d model , it is possible to study effects arising from variations of the saw amplitude @xmath157 in space ( due to screening effects , or to multiple reflections from the channel s ends ) , or from random energies @xmath168 , which may represent impurities within the channel .",
    "using simplified models , we have demonstrated that interference effects suffice to produce transfer of integral number of electrons through a mesoscopic ( unbiased ) system , subject to a periodically - varying potential .",
    "the calculations presented above utilize the expression for the pumped charge , @xmath0 , in the adiabatic approximation , that is , keeping only the first - order of the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "however , the next - order corrections need not be small ; it is therefore an open question whether the quantization , and its relation to resonant transmission , will still be present when higher terms in the temporal expansion are retained .",
