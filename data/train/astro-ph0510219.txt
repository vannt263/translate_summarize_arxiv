    "elliptical galaxies and bulges divide into two groups with fundamental differences in their morphological , dynamic and core profile properties @xcite .",
    "luminous systems rotate slowly , have boxy isophotes and cores , whereas faint early - type galaxies show rapid rotation , discy isophotes and a cuspy central luminosity profile .",
    "these differences can be interpreted as differences in the formation of both classes which may be reflected in their stellar populations .",
    "studies of stellar populations have revealed signs of secondary star formation in some lenticular galaxies @xcite .",
    "many early - type galaxies show kinematic peculiarities such as nuclear stellar and gaseous discs , kinematically decoupled components ( kdc ) or minor axis rotation @xcite .",
    "a combination of 2-dimensional kinematics and stellar population analysis provides information about the formation history of early - type galaxies .",
    "the fornax cluster galaxies ngc1427 , ngc1380 , ngc1381 were observed with the gmos ifu , and a second sample of ngc1339 , ngc1375 , ngc1419 and eso358-g25 and additionally ngc3379 were observed with the vimos ifu . the vimos ifu has a large field of view of @xmath2 at a spatial resolution of @xmath3 , whereas gmos has a smaller field of view of @xmath4 but offers a spatial resolution of @xmath5 .",
    "this approach allows a study of the larger kinematic scales and to detect possible line strength gradients in the vimos sample , while on the other hand the very centres of the galaxies observed with gmos can be studied in great detail .",
    "relations between the internal kinematics and stellar populations are indicative of the star formation history of the host galaxy .",
    "the wavelength range of the combined sample , approximately 4200  to 5500 , includes h@xmath6 and higher order balmer lines , allowing an age measurement largely insensitive to metallicity effects .",
    "several fe indices and mg line strengths are measured to determine the metallicity and [ mg / fe ] ratio of the stellar populations .",
    "[ fig : vmaps ] shows the stellar velocity maps of ngc1427 ( left panel ) and ngc1419 ( right panel ) .",
    "the known decoupled core of ngc1427 is clearly visible .",
    "for the first time , a kinematically decoupled core is also detected in ngc1419 .",
    "line strength maps for the same galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : linemaps ] .",
    "the top panels show the h@xmath6 ( left ) and mg@xmath7 ( right ) distribution in ngc1427 , while the bottom panels show the same for ngc1419 . in the h@xmath6 distribution",
    ", there is an increase towards the centre visible in ngc1419 , whereas the distribution is almost flat in ngc1427 .",
    "both galaxies show an mg@xmath7 gradient with increasing line strengths towards the centre , which is more pronounced in ngc1419 .",
    "a comparison between the velocity and line strength maps implies that the stellar populations in the decoupled components do not differ significantly from the main body of the galaxies ."
