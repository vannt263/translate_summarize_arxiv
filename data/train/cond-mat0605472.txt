    "one - dimensional systems of interacting particles are particularly fascinating both from a theoretical and experimental point of view .",
    "such systems have been extensively investigated theoretically for more than 40 years now .",
    "they are wonderful systems in which interactions play a very special role and whose physics is drastically different from the ` normal ' physics of interacting particles , that is , the one known in higher dimensions . from the theoretical point of view",
    "they present quite unique features .",
    "the one - dimensional character makes the problem simple enough so that some rather complete solutions could be obtained using specific methods , and yet complex enough to lead to incredibly rich physics @xcite .",
    "crucial theoretical progress were made and many theoretical tools got developed , mostly in the 1970 s allowing a detailed understanding of the properties of such systems .",
    "this culminated in the 1980 s with a new concept of interacting one - dimensional particles , analogous to the fermi liquid for interacting electrons in three dimensions : the luttinger liquid . since then many developments have enriched further our understanding of such systems , ranging from conformal field theory to important progress in the exact solutions such as bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "in addition to these important theoretical progress , experimental realizations have knows comparably spectacular developments .",
    "one - dimensional systems were mostly at the beginning a theorist s toy .",
    "experimental realizations started to appear in the 1970 s with polymers and organic compounds .",
    "but in the last 20 years or so we have seen a real explosion of realization of one - dimensional systems .",
    "the progress in material research made it possible to realize bulk materials with one - dimensional structures inside .",
    "the most famous ones are the organic superconductors @xcite and the spin and ladder compounds @xcite . at the same time , the tremendous progress in nanotechnology allowed to obtain realizations of isolated one - dimensional systems such as quantum wires @xcite , josephson junction arrays @xcite , edge states in quantum hall systems @xcite , and nanotubes @xcite .",
    "last but not least , the recent progress in bose condensation in optical traps have allowed an unprecedented way to probe for strong interaction effects in such systems @xcite .",
    "the goal of these lectures was therefore to present the major theoretical tools of the domain .",
    "however , while writing these notes , i was faced with a dilemma . having written a recent book on this very subject @xcite it felt that writing these notes would be a simple repetition or worse a butchering of the explanations that could be found in the book .",
    "i have thus chosen to give to these notes a slightly different focuss than the material that was actually presented during the course .",
    "for an introduction to the one dimensional systems and in particular for the fermionic problems , as well as most of the technical details , i refer the reader to @xcite where all this material is described in detail and hopefully in a pedagogical fashion suitable for graduate students .",
    "i have chosen to restrict these notes to the description of one and quasi - one dimensional systems of bosons .",
    "indeed the spectacular recent progress made thanks to cold atomic gases , make it useful to have a short summary on the subject , in complement of the material that can already be found in @xcite .",
    "note that although these notes do cover some of the basic material for cold atoms they can not pretend to be an exhaustive and complete review on this rapidly developing subject .",
    "the whole volume of this book would not be sufficient for that .",
    "rather they reflect a partial selection , based on my own excitement in the field and its connections with the low dimensional world .",
    "i thus apologize in advance for those whose pet theory , experiment or paper i would fail to mention in these notes .",
    "bosons are particularly interesting systems to investigate . from the theoretical point of view bosons",
    "present quite interesting peculiarities and are in fact a priori much more difficult to treat than their fermionic counterpart . indeed , for fermions , the free fermion approximation is usually a good starting point , at least in high enough dimension where fermi liquid theory holds . some perturbations such as disorder can be studied for the much simpler free fermion case , the pauli principle ensuring that even in the absence of interactions the perturbation remains small compared to the characteristic scales of the free problem ( here the fermi energy ) .",
    "one can thus gain valuable physical intuition on the problem before adding the interactions . for bosons , on the contrary ,",
    "interactions are needed from the start since there are radical differences between a non - interacting boson gas and an interacting one .",
    "bosons have another remarkable property , namely in the absence of interactions all the particles can condense in a macroscopic state .",
    "interacting bosons thus constitute a remarkable theoretical challenge .",
    "one dimension presents additional peculiarities as we will see below .    before embarking on the subject of interacting bosons ,",
    "let us first discuss how one can obtain `` one dimensional '' objects .",
    "of course the real world is three dimensional , but all the one dimensional system are characterized by a confining potential forcing the particles to be in a localized states    .",
    "@xmath0 is the direction of the tube .",
    "only one transverse direction of confinement has been shown for clarity . due to the transverse confining potential",
    "the transverse degrees of freedom are strongly quantized .",
    "( right ) dispersion relation @xmath1 . only half of the dispersion relation",
    "is shown for clarity .",
    "@xmath2 is the momentum parallel to the tube direction .",
    "the degrees of freedom transverse to the tube direction lead to the formation of minibands , labelled by a quantum number @xmath3 .",
    "one can be in a situation where only one miniband can be excited , due to temperature or interactions , the energy scale of which is represented by the gray box . in that case",
    "the system is equivalent to a one dimensional system where only longitudinal degrees of freedom can vary . ]",
    "the wavefunction of the system is thus of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 depends on the precise form of the confining potential for an infinite well , a show in fig .",
    "[ fig : confwire ] , @xmath5 is @xmath6 , whereas it would be a gaussian function ( [ eq : harmfond ] ) for an harmonic confinement .",
    "the energy is of the form @xmath7 where for simplicity i have taken hard walls confinement .",
    "the important point is the fact that due to the narrowness of the transverse channel @xmath8 , the quantization of @xmath9 is sizeable .",
    "indeed , the change in energy by changing the transverse quantum number @xmath10 is at least ( e.g. @xmath11 to @xmath12 ) @xmath13 this leads to minibands as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : confwire ] .",
    "if the distance between the minibands is larger than the temperature or interactions energy one is in a situation where only one miniband can be excited .",
    "the transverse degrees of freedom are thus frozen and only @xmath2 matters .",
    "the system is a one - dimensional quantum system .",
    "we can thus forget about the transverse directions and model the bosons keeping only the longitudinal degrees of freedom .",
    "two slightly different starting points are possible",
    ". one can start directly in the continuum , where bosons are described by @xmath14 the first term is the kinetic energy , the second term is the repulsion @xmath15 between the bosons and the last term is the chemical potential .",
    "a famous model , exactly solvable by bethe - ansatz @xcite uses a local repulsion @xmath16 note that @xmath15 is not the real atom - atom interaction in three dimensional space but an effective interaction where the transverse degrees of freedom have already been incorporated .",
    "the extension of the transverse wavefunction is of course much larger than the dimensions of the atoms themselves , so the hard core repulsion between two atoms can be safely forgotten .",
    "the three dimensional interaction is characterized by a scattering length @xcite @xmath17 by @xmath18 note that for bosons the s - wave scattering is the important one since two bosons can get close together due to the symmetry of their wave function , while for fermions this scattering would be highly inefficient .",
    "@xmath19 in ( [ eq : localint ] ) is obtained by integrating over the transverse degrees of freedom of the wavefunction . because the effective interaction depends on the extension of the transverse wavefunction it will be possible to vary ( increase ) it by increasing the confinement @xcite . to be closer to the situation for cold atomic gases one has to remember that there is also a confining potential in the longitudinal direction even if this one is much more shallow and therefore the chemical potential is spatially dependent , leading to a term of the form @xmath20 \\rho(x)\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the confining potential . in the absence of interactions the ground state of the system",
    "is given by an harmonic oscillator wavefunction @xmath22 in the absence of the confining potential the bosons are in a plane wave state of momentum @xmath23 , whereas here they are confined on a typical length of order @xmath24 in presence of the harmonic potential .",
    "a similar but much tighter confinement is imposed in the transverse directions as well , leading to the formation of the tubes as discussed above .",
    "typical longitudinal lengths due to the harmonic confinement are @xmath25 while the transverse dimensions can be @xmath26 @xcite .    due to the trap",
    "the density profile is thus non homogeneous . in the absence of interactions",
    "it would just be the gaussian profile of ( [ eq : harmfond ] ) . in presence of interactions a similar effect",
    "occurs but the profile changes . a very simple way to see this effect is when one can neglect the kinetic energy ( so called thomas - fermi approximation ; for other situations see @xcite ) . in that case",
    "the density profile is obtained by minimizing ( [ eq : boscont ] ) and ( [ eq : varchem ] ) , leading to @xmath27 = 0\\ ] ] the density profile is thus an inverted parabola , reflecting the change of the chemical potential .",
    "one can express the confining length as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the density at the center of the trap .",
    "of course dealing with such inhomogeneous system is a complication and has consequences that i will discuss below . to treat this problem ,",
    "there are various approximations that one can make .",
    "the crudest way of dealing with such a confinement is simply to ignore the spatial variation and remember the trap as giving a finite size to the system .    in the model ( [ eq : boscont ] ) , the bosons move in a continuum .",
    "it is interesting to add to the system ( [ eq : boscont ] ) a periodic potential @xmath30 coupled to the density @xcite",
    "@xmath31 this term , which favors certain points in space for the position of the bosons , mimics the presence of a lattice of period @xmath32 , the periodicity of the potential @xmath30 .",
    "we take the potential as @xmath33\\ ] ] one has thus @xmath34 .",
    "the presence of the lattice can drastically change the properties of an interacting one dimensional system as i will discuss below .    if the lattice is much higher than the kinetic energy it is better to start from a tight binding representation @xcite . in that case in each minima of the lattice one can approximate the periodic potential by an harmonic one @xmath35 .",
    "one has thus on each site harmonic oscillator wavefunctions that hybridize to form a band .",
    "if @xmath36 is large the energy levels in each well are well separated and one can retain only the ground state wavefunction in each well .",
    "the system can then be represented directly by a model defined on a lattice @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( resp @xmath39 ) destroys ( resp .",
    "creates ) a boson on site @xmath40 .",
    "the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are respectively the effective hopping , interaction and local chemical potential .",
    "because the overlap between different sites is very small the interaction is really local .",
    "since atoms are neutral this model is a very good approximation of the experimental situation .",
    "such a model known as a bose - hubbard model has been used extensively in a variety of other contexts ( see e.g. @xcite for more details and references ) . the effective parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be easily computed by a standard tight binding calculation using the shape of the on site wave function ( [ eq : harmfond ] ) with @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is identical to ( [ eq : harmfond ] ) but with @xmath36 replaced by the transverse confinement @xmath48 . for large lattice sizes an approximate formula is given by @xcite @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the so called recoil energy , i.e. the kinetic energy for a momentum of order @xmath51 . @xmath48",
    "the denotes the harmonic confining potential in the two transverse directions of the tube .",
    "typical values for the above parameters are @xmath52 while @xmath53",
    "the repulsion term acts if there are two or more bosons per site .",
    "it is easy to see from ( [ eq : opticalparam ] ) that , in addition to the special effects created by the lattice itself , imposing an optical lattice is a simple way to kill the kinetic energy of the system while leaving interactions practically unaffected .",
    "it is thus a convenient way to make the quantum system `` more interacting '' and has been used as such .",
    "of course , it is possible to also add to ( [ eq : bosehub ] ) longer range interactions if they are present in the microscopic system .",
    "one naively expects the two models ( [ eq : boscont ] ) plus the lattice terms ( [ eq : boslat ] ) and ( [ eq : bosehub ] ) to have the same asymptotic physics , the latter one being of course much more well suited in the case of large periodic potential .",
    "of course the above models are very difficult to solve , since the tools that one usually uses fail because of the one dimensional nature of the problem .",
    "it is customary when dealing with a superfluid to use a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) mean field theory where the order parameter @xmath54 represents the condensed fraction .",
    "the time dependent gl is the celebrated gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite . however in one dimension it is impossible to break a continuum symmetry even at zero temperature so a true condensate can not exist for an infinite size system .",
    "this means that quantum fluctuation will play an important role and that the gp equation is not a very good starting point .",
    "one has thus to find other ways to deal with the interactions .",
    "the model ( [ eq : boscont ] ) in the continuum is exactly solvable by bethe ansatz ( ba ) @xcite , which provides very useful physical insight .",
    "unfortunately the ba solution does not allow the calculation of quantities such as asymptotic correlation functions , and thus must be supplemented by other techniques .",
    "for the particular model of bosons with a local repulsion , one point of special interest is the point where the repulsion between the bosons is infinite .",
    "the system is then known as hard core bosons . in that case",
    "it becomes impossible to put two bosons on the same site .",
    "this is the tonks - girardeau ( tg ) limit @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that in that case this system of hard core bosons can be mapped either to a spin chain system ( the presence or absence of bosons being respectively an up or down spin ) , or by a jordan - wigner transformation to a system of spinless fermions .",
    "we will use repeatedly this analogy between hard core bosons and fermions and the following sections .",
    "more details on the various mappings and equivalences between spins , fermions and bosons can be found in @xcite .",
    "treating interacting bosons in one dimension is a quite difficult task .",
    "one very interesting technique is provided by the so - called bosonization .",
    "it has the advantage of giving a very simple description of the low energy properties of the system , and of being completely general and very useful for many one dimensional systems .",
    "this chapter will thus describe it in some details . for more details and physical insights on this technique both for fermions and bosons",
    "i refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the idea behind the bosonization technique is to reexpress the excitations of the system in a basis of collective excitations @xcite . indeed in one dimension it is easy to realize that single particle excitations can not really exit .",
    "one particle when moving will push its neighbors and so on , which means that any individual motion is converted into a collective one .",
    "one can thus hope that a base of collective excitations is a good basis to represent the excitations of a one dimensional system .    to exploit this idea ,",
    "let us start with the density operator @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the position operator of the @xmath40th particle .",
    "we label the position of the @xmath40th particle by an ` equilibrium ' position @xmath57 that the particle would occupy if the particles were forming a perfect crystalline lattice , and the displacement @xmath58 relative to this equilibrium position .",
    "thus , @xmath59 if @xmath29 is the average density of particles , @xmath60 is the distance between the particles .",
    "then , the equilibrium position of the @xmath40th particle is @xmath61 note that at that stage it is not important whether we are dealing with fermions or bosons .",
    "the density operator written as ( [ eq : densmoche ] ) is not very convenient . to rewrite it in a more pleasant form we introduce a labelling field @xmath62 @xcite",
    "this field , which is a continuous function of the position , takes the value @xmath63 at the position of the @xmath40th particle .",
    "it can thus be viewed as a way to number the particles . since in one dimension ,",
    "contrary to higher dimensions , one can always number the particles in an unique way ( e.g. starting at @xmath64 and processing from left to right ) , this field is always well - defined .",
    "some examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : labelfield ] .    .",
    "if the particles form a perfect lattice of lattice spacing @xmath65 , then @xmath66 , and is just a straight line .",
    "different functions @xmath62 allow to put the particles at any position in space .",
    "note that @xmath67 is always an increasing function regardless of the position of the particles . ]    using this labelling field and the rules for transforming @xmath68 functions @xmath69 one can rewrite the density as @xmath70 it is easy to see from fig .",
    "[ fig : labelfield ] that @xmath62 can always be taken as an increasing function of @xmath0 , which allows to drop the absolute value in ( [ eq : denslab ] ) . using the poisson summation formula",
    "this can be rewritten @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an integer .",
    "it is convenient to define a field @xmath5 relative to the perfect crystalline solution and to introduce @xmath73 the density becomes @xmath74 \\sum_p e^{i 2 p ( \\pi \\rho_0 x - \\phi(x))}\\ ] ] since the density operators at two different sites commute it is normal to expect that the field @xmath67 commutes with itself . note that if one averages the density over distances large compared to the interparticle distance @xmath65 all oscillating terms in ( [ eq : locintbos ] ) vanish .",
    "thus , only @xmath75 remains and this smeared density is @xmath76 we can now write the single - particle creation operator @xmath77 . such an operator can always be written as @xmath78^{1/2}e^{-i \\theta(x)}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is some operator . in the case where one would have bose condensation , @xmath80 would just be the superfluid phase of the system .",
    "the commutation relations between the @xmath81 impose some commutation relations between the density operators and the @xmath79 . for bosons ,",
    "the condition is @xmath82 = \\delta(x - x')\\ ] ] using ( [ eq : singlephen ] ) the commutator gives @xmath83^{1/2}[\\rho(x')]^{1/2}e^{-i \\theta(x ' ) }   -[\\rho(x')]^{1/2}e^{-i \\theta(x')}e^{+i \\theta(x)}[\\rho(x)]^{1/2}\\ ] ] if we assume quite reasonably that the field @xmath80 commutes with itself ( @xmath84 = 0 $ ] ) , the commutator ( [ eq : comexpl ] ) is obviously zero for @xmath85 if ( for @xmath86 ) @xmath87^{1/2},e^{-i \\theta(x ' ) } ] = 0\\ ] ] a sufficient condition to satisfy ( [ eq : comphen ] ) would thus be @xmath88 = \\delta(x - x')e^{-i\\theta(x')}\\ ] ]",
    "it is easy to check that if the density were only the smeared density ( [ eq : smeardens ] ) then ( [ eq : commutbas ] ) is obviously satisfied if @xmath89 = -i \\delta(x - x')\\ ] ] one can show that this is indeed the correct condition to use @xcite . equation ( [ eq : conjphi ] )",
    "proves that @xmath80 and @xmath90 are canonically conjugate .",
    "note that for the moment this results from totally general considerations and does not rest on a given microscopic model .",
    "such commutation relations are also physically very reasonable since they encode the well known duality relation between the superfluid phase and the total number of particles . integrating by part ( [ eq : conjphi ] ) shows that @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the canonically conjugate momentum to @xmath67 .    to obtain the single - particle operator one can substitute ( [ eq : locintbos ] ) into ( [ eq : singlephen ] ) .",
    "since the square root of a delta function is also a delta function up to a normalization factor the square root of @xmath93 is identical to @xmath93 up to a normalization factor that depends on the ultraviolet structure of the theory .",
    "thus , @xmath94^{1/2 }   \\sum_{p } e^{i 2 p ( \\pi \\rho_0 x - \\phi(x))}e^{-i \\theta(x)}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath95 emphasizes that this is the representation of a _ bosonic _ creation operator .",
    "a similar formula can be derived for fermionic operators @xcite .",
    "the above formulas are a way to represent the excitations of the system directly in terms of variables defined in the continuum limit , and ( [ eq : singlebos ] ) and ( [ eq : locintbos ] ) are the basis of the bosonization dictionary .    the fact that all operators are now expressed in terms of variables describing _ collective _ excitations is at the heart of the use of such representation , since as already pointed out , in one dimension excitations are necessarily collective as soon as interactions are present . in addition the fields @xmath5 and @xmath80 have a very simple physical interpretation .",
    "if one forgets their canonical commutation relations , order in @xmath80 indicates that the system has a coherent phase as indicated by ( [ eq : singlebos ] ) , which is the signature of superfluidity . on the other hand order in @xmath5",
    "means that the density is a perfectly periodic pattern as can be seen from ( [ eq : locintbos ] ) .",
    "this means that the system of bosons has `` crystallized '' . as we now see",
    ", the simplicity of this representation in fact allows to solve an interacting system of bosons in one dimension .      what is the hamiltonian of the system ? using ( [ eq : singlebos ] )",
    ", the kinetic energy becomes @xmath96 which is the part coming from the single - particle operator containing less powers of @xmath97 and thus the most relevant . using ( [ eq : boscont ] ) and ( [ eq : locintbos ] ) , the interaction term becomes @xmath98 plus higher order operators .",
    "keeping only the above lowest order shows that the hamiltonian of the interacting bosonic system can be rewritten as @xmath99\\ ] ] where i have put back the @xmath100 for completeness .",
    "this leads to the action @xmath101\\ ] ] this hamiltonian is a standard sound wave one .",
    "the fluctuation of the phase @xmath5 represent the `` phonon '' modes of the density wave as given by ( [ eq : locintbos ] ) .",
    "one immediately sees that this action leads to a dispersion relation , @xmath102 , i.e. to a linear spectrum .",
    "@xmath103 is the velocity of the excitations .",
    "@xmath104 is a dimensionless parameter whose role will be apparent below .",
    "the parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 are used to parameterize the two coefficients in front of the two operators . in the above expressions they are given by @xmath105",
    "this shows that for weak interactions @xmath106 while @xmath107 . in establishing the above expressions we have thrown away the higher order operators , that are less relevant",
    "the important point is that these higher order terms will not change the form of the hamiltonian ( like making cross terms between @xmath5 and @xmath80 appears etc . ) but _ only _ renormalize the coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( for more details see @xcite ) . for galilean invariant system",
    "the first relation is exactly satisfied regardless of the strength of the interaction @xcite .",
    "the low - energy properties of interacting bosons are thus described by an hamiltonian of the form ( [ eq : luthamphen ] ) _ provided _ the proper @xmath103 and @xmath104 are used .",
    "these two coefficients _ totally _ characterize the low - energy properties of massless one - dimensional systems .",
    "the bosonic representation and hamiltonian ( [ eq : luthamphen ] ) play the same role for one - dimensional systems than the fermi liquid theory plays for higher - dimensional systems .",
    "it is an effective low - energy theory that is the fixed point of any massless phase , regardless of the precise form of the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "this theory , which is known as luttinger liquid theory @xcite , depends only on the two parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "provided that the correct value of these parameters are used , _ all _ asymptotic properties of the correlation functions of the system then can be obtained _ exactly _ using ( [ eq : locintbos ] ) and ( [ eq : singlephen ] ) .    in the absence of a good perturbation theory ( e.g. in the interaction ) such as ( [ eq : ukpert ] ) , it is difficult to compute these coefficients .",
    "one has two ways of proceeding .",
    "either one is attached to a particular microscopic model ( such as the bose - hubbard model for example ) .",
    "in which case the luttinger liquid coefficients @xmath103 and @xmath104 are functions of the microscopic parameters .",
    "one thus just needs two relations involving these coefficients that can be computed with the microscopic model and determine these coefficients , thus allowing to compute _ _",
    "a__ll correlation functions . how to do that depends on taste and integrability or not of the model .",
    "if the model is integrable by bethe - ansatz such as the lieb - liniger model one computes thermodynamics from ba and obtains @xmath103 and @xmath104 that way @xcite .",
    "if the model is not exactly solvable one can still use numerics such as exact diagonalization , monte - carlo or dmrg technique to compute these coefficients . because they can be extracted from thermodynamic quantities ,",
    "their determination suffers usually from very little finite size effects compared to a direct calculation of the correlation functions .",
    "the luttinger liquid theory thus provides , coupled with the numerics , an incredibly accurate way to compute correlations and physical properties of a system . for more details on the various procedures and models",
    "see @xcite .",
    "but , of course , a much more important use of luttinger liquid theory is to justify the use of the boson hamiltonian and fermion  boson relations as starting points for any microscopic model .",
    "the luttinger parameters then become some effective parameters .",
    "they can be taken as input , based on general rules ( e.g. for bosons @xmath108 for non interacting bosons and @xmath104 decreases as the repulsion increases , for other general rules see @xcite ) , without any reference to a particular microscopic model .",
    "this removes part of the caricatural aspects of any modelization of a true experimental system .",
    "this use of the luttinger liquid is reminiscent of the one made of fermi liquid theory .",
    "very often calculations are performed in solids starting from ` free ' electrons and adding important perturbations ( such as the bcs attractive interaction to obtain superconductivity ) .",
    "the justification of such a procedure is rooted in the fermi liquid theory , where one does not deal with ` real ' electrons but with the quasiparticles , which are intrinsically fermionic in nature .",
    "the mass @xmath109 and the fermi velocity @xmath110 are then some parameters .",
    "the calculations in @xmath111 proceed in the same spirit with the luttinger liquid replacing the fermi liquid .",
    "the luttinger liquid theory is thus an invaluable tool to tackle the effect of perturbations on an interacting one - dimensional electron gas ( such as the effect of lattice , impurities , coupling between chains , etc . ) .",
    "i will illustrate such use in the following sections , taking as examples the effects of a periodic potential and a disordered one .",
    "let us now examine in details the physical properties of such a luttinger liquid .",
    "for this we need the correlation functions .",
    "i briefly show here how to compute them using the standard operator technique .",
    "more detailed calculations and functional integral methods are given in @xcite .",
    "a building block to compute the various observables is @xmath112 ^ 2 \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the standard time ordering operator , and @xmath114 the imaginary time @xcite .",
    "we absorb the factor @xmath104 in the hamiltonian by rescaling the fields ( this preserves the commutation relation ) @xmath115 the fields @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be expressed in terms of bosons operator @xmath118=\\delta_{q , q'}$ ] .",
    "this ensures that their canonical commutation relations are satisfied .",
    "one has @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the size of the system and @xmath121 a short distance cutoff ( of the order of the interparticle distance ) needed to regularize the theory at short scales .",
    "the above expressions are in fact slightly simplified and zero modes should also be incorporated @xcite .",
    "this will not affect the remaining of this section and the calculation of the correlation functions .",
    "it is easy to check by a direct substitution of ( [ eq : phitetbos ] ) in ( [ eq : luthamphen ] ) that hamiltonian ( [ eq : luthamphen ] ) with @xmath122 is simply @xmath123 the time dependence of the field can now be easily computed from ( [ eq : hamsimlut ] ) and ( [ eq : phitetbos ] ) .",

    "[ fig : quartmot ] , in order to stabilize a structure with a certain spacing between the particles one needs interactions that can reach at least to such a distance . in particular for cold atoms , since the interactions are mostly local , one can expect a mott insulator to be possible for one ( or any integer ) number of fermions per site .",
    "other insulating phases ( 1 boson each two sites etc . ) would need longer range interactions .",

    "another way to recover this result is to start from the commensurate case and apply a chemical potential . using the boson representation ( [ eq : locintbos ] )",
    "the chemical potential term becomes @xmath198 the chemical potential can be absorbed by a redefinition of the field @xmath5 .",
    "introducing @xmath199 the hamiltonian is now quadratic again in @xmath116 while the commensurate umklapp ( [ eq : umkcond ] ) is now changed into ( [ eq : complet ] ) .",
    "we see again that an incommensurate filling is washing out the cosine , therefore leading back to a luttinger liquid state .",
    "however if the deviations from commensurability are small the doping is only acting for lengthscales larger than @xmath200 that can be quite large compared to the lattice spacing .",
    "this leads to an interesting physics that i examine below . for more details on the mott transition and the difference between working with a fixed density and a fixed chemical potential",

    "there are too numerous to be all mentioned here , so i will simply briefly mention two of them .    first , in cold atomic gases , in addition to the optical lattice there is usually the harmonic confining potential ( [ eq : varchem ] )",
    ". as was already discussed , it acts as a chemical potential .",
    "the density is thus non - uniform , and there is thus no meaning as looking at the system as wholly in a commensurate mott state or not .",
    "however as we saw , upon small doping , a mott insulator prefers to keep the commensurability as much as possible and makes discomensurations between two commensurate regions . in presence of the trap",
    "one can thus expect a similar behavior , and to have sequences of incommensurate regions separated by commensurate ones .",
    "how these regions are organized is an interesting question , that has been intensely studied @xcite .",
    "another important question connected to this problem is how to probe for the existence of such an insulating state . as discussed before measuring the momentum distribution @xmath158",
    "gives direct information , since it has a divergence at @xmath161 for a superfluid phase and none in the insulating one @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath158 is only providing limited information , and would also be much less informative in the case of fermion where one has essentially a broadened step at the fermi energy regardless of whether the system is superconducting or insulating .",
    "it is thus important to study other probes of the mott phase such as noise @xcite or shaking of the lattice @xcite .",
    "understanding the physics of such shaken lattices is an interesting problem for which i refer the reader to the literature @xcite .",
    "another interesting class of problems is to determine how the 1d mott insulating properties can affect the physics of the system when there is not a single chain but many chains coupled together .",
    "more generally it is important to determine how the one - dimensional physics is changed when one goes from a purely one - dimensional system to a two- or three - dimensional situation .",
    "such a crossover between the one dimensional properties and the three dimensional ones is particularly important since many systems are made of coupled one dimensional chains @xcite .",
    "cold atomic systems provide a very controlled way to probe for such a physics , since it is possible to control the strength of the optical lattice in each direction .",
    "if the transverse optical lattice is large it can be treated by the same tight binding approximation than the one leading to ( [ eq : bosehub ] ) .",
    "the most important term describing the coupling between the chains is the interchain tunnelling traducing the fact that single particles are able to hop from one chain to the next @xmath232\\ ] ] where @xmath233 denotes a pair of chains , and @xmath234 is the hopping integral between these two chains .",
    "these hopping integrals are of course directly determined by the overlap of the orbitals of the various chains .",
    "in addition to the single particle hopping , there are of course also in principle direct interactions terms between the chains .",
    "such terms can be density - density or spin - spin exchange",
    ". however they are easy to treat using mean field approximation .",
    "for example a spin - spin term @xmath235 can be viewed , in a mean field approximation , as an effective ` classical ' field acting on chain @xmath236 : @xmath237 .",
    "thus , at least for an infinite number of chains for which one could expect a mean field approach to be qualitatively correct , the physics of such a term is transparent : it pushes the system to an ordered state .",
    "note that for cold atoms since the interactions are short range such terms do not normally exist and ( [ eq : singlehop ] ) is the only term coupling the chains . for other cases",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the single particle hopping is more subtle to treat . for fermions",
    "no mean field description is possible since a single fermion operator has no classical limit .",
    "it is thus impossible to approximate @xmath238 as @xmath239 , which makes the solution of the problem of coupled chains quite complicated @xcite . for bosons",
    "one is in a slightly better situation since the single boson operator has a mean field value .",
    "however even in that case there is a direct competition between this interchain hopping that would like to stabilize a three dimensional superfluid phase and the 1d mott insulating term that would favor an insulating state . as a function of the strength of the interchain hopping there is thus a deconfinement transition where the system goes from a 1d insulator made of essentially uncoupled chains , to a an anisotropic 3d superfluid .",
    "such a transition has been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite and",
    "i refer the reader to these references for more details .",
    "quite generally such a transition is relevant in various other type of systems as well @xcite .",
    "we have examined in the previous section the effects of a periodic potential on an interacting bosonic system .",
    "another important class of potential , leading to radically new physics , is the case of a disordered potential . here",
    "again the bosonization solution is a powerful tool to tackle this problem .",
    "disorder for quantum problems is a longstanding problem . in condensed matter",
    ", some level of disorder is unavoidable , and it is thus necessary to deal with it . the naive expectation is to think that the disorder will have weaker effects for a quantum system than for a classical one . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disnaif ]     ( a ) a classical particle of energy @xmath240 smaller than the disorder @xmath241 at a given point is totally blocked .",
    "( b ) a quantum mechanical system of the same energy can pass through the barrier by tunnel effect .",
    "one could therefore naively think that quantum systems are much less localized by disorder than their classical equivalents .",
    "in fact it is exactly the contrary that happens . ]",
    "one can imagine that waves in a quantum system have more ease to pass the barriers induced by the disorder since they can use tunnel effect .",
    "it was thus a major surprise when anderson showed @xcite that it was in fact exactly the opposite effect that occurred for non - interacting quantum particles . indeed because of the constructive interferences of two paths that are deduced by time inversion there is an additional probability for a particle to be backscattered by the disorder @xcite . loosely speaking one should add the wave functions , and thus squaring them getting a factor of four , instead of the naive factor of two of two paths that would not interfere .",
    "the main effect is that the wavefunctions of the system , instead of being plane waves , now decay exponentially in space .",
    "this phenomenon , known as anderson localization is strongly dependent on dimension .",
    "simple scaling arguments show that all states should be localized in one and two dimensions @xcite . in three dimensions , a mobility edge in energy exists below which states are localized and above which they are extended .",
    "an important characteristic of such states is thus the localization length @xmath242 characterizing the spatial decay of the localized states .",
    "this phenomenon is now well understood for noninteracting particles . for fermions , i.e. electrons",
    "is condensed matter , interactions do exist . however because of the pauli principle , the important electrons , at the fermi level have a large kinetic energy @xmath243 .",
    "if this energy is large compared to their interaction it is very reasonable to assume that the noninteracting limit is a good starting point .",
    "indeed , the corresponding predictions for the localization localization have been spectacularly confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "treating the combined effects of interactions and disorder is a particularly challenging problem , even for fermions . indeed because of the disorder the motion of the particles becomes much slower than the one of free particles . from ballistic it becomes diffusive at best , which means that two particles can spend more time close to each other .",
    "there is thus an extremely strong reinforcement of the interactions by the disorder @xcite .",
    "this leads to singularities and to a physics that is still under debate . here",
    "again the effect of the dimension is crucial , since the singularities increase with lowering dimension .",
    "one can expect one dimension , where disorder lead to all state being localized and the interaction leads to the luttinger liquid state , to be particularly special .",
    "i will not dwell further on this problem here and refer the reader to the above literature for further references .",
    "the case of bosons is even more interesting . indeed in that case the noninteracting case can not even be used as a reasonable starting point . to understand this",
    "let us simply look at a disorder that would take two values @xmath244 on each site .",
    "let us assume that one can find a region of space of length @xmath245 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raredis ] .",
    "such a region always exists with a probability @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the characteristic correlation length of the disorder .",
    "the lowest energy of one boson confined to this region can be readily computed . because the boson is confined to a region of size @xmath245",
    "its momentum is @xmath248 instead of zero , since the wavefunction has to essentially vanish at the edges of the region .",
    "thus the total energy is @xmath249 it is thus easy to see that provided that @xmath245 is large enough this energy is lower than putting the boson in the lowest plane wave state with @xmath75 where the kinetic energy and average disorder energy would both be zero .",
    "thus one boson will simply go into this finite size region .",
    "but then for noninteracting bosons they all condense in the same state . for noninteracting bosons ,",
    "the superfluid is thus destroyed for arbitrarily weak disorder , and all the particles go to a region of finite size , forming a puddle .",
    "the effect of the interactions on such a state is of course crucial , since a macroscopic number of particles @xmath250 ( proportional to the total size of the system @xmath120 ) condense into a finite size region @xmath245 the density is infinite .",
    "any infinitesimal repulsion makes thus this state unstable . for bosons",
    "one has thus to include interactions from the start to get a meaningful answer .",
    "let us now turn to the problem of such an interacting disordered bosonic gas . in one dimension",
    "this problem was solved in @xcite .",
    "building on this microscopic solution scaling analysis were developped to investigate this question in higher dimensions @xcite . here",
    "also the bosonization representation is particularly useful to deal with the effects of disorder on the one - dimensional boson gas .",
    "the disorder can be introduced as a random potential coupled to the density .",
    "for simplicity i stick here to the incommensurate case .",
    "the disorder is @xmath251 where @xmath241 is a random variable .",
    "one should fix the distribution for @xmath241 which of course depends on the problem at hand .",
    "however if the disorder is weak so that the characteristics of the boson system vary slowly at the lengthscale of variation of the disorder , central limit theorem shows that one can approximate the distribution by a gaussian one .",
    "using the representation ( [ eq : locintbos ] ) of the density one has ( keeping only the lowest , that is , most relevant harmonics ) @xmath252\\ ] ] this expression shows one remarkable fact .",
    "different fourier components of the disorder act quite differently on the density , and it is important to distinguish these fourier components . the natural separation between these different terms is again @xmath253 , i.e. the average distance between the bosons .",
    "the first term is @xmath254 since the field @xmath5 is smooth at the length scale of the distance between particles , this term couples essentially to the smooth variations of the disorder @xmath241 varying at a lengthscale much larger than the distance between particles . note the analogy with the chemical potential term ( [ eq : chemcont ] ) .",
    "this term is analogous so a slowly varying chemical potential .",
    "it is easy to see that this term can be again trivially absorbed @xcite in a redefinition of the field @xmath5 by @xmath255 this means that the smeared density @xmath256 follows the variation of the potential as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forward ]     the fourier component of the random potential @xmath241 with wavevector small compared to the inverse particle distance act as a random chemical potential .",
    "this term increases or decreases smoothly the density . for weak disorder this term does not lead to any localization of the bosons and",
    "does not affect the currents or the superfluid correlations .",
    "for the tg limit , it would be the equivalent of the forward scattering for the fermions ( see text ) .",
    "the density is indicated by the gray area , while a schematic position of the bosons is given . ]",
    "note that the coefficient that relates the change of density to the change of potential is of course the compressibility of the bosons , which is now finite due to the interactions .",
    "this term is thus a very classical effect where the bosons go in puddles in the holes of the random potential .",
    "the oscillations at @xmath257 of the density are deeply affected . in the pure system",
    "these correlations were decaying as a powerlaw .",
    "now they behave as @xmath258 if one takes a gaussian disorder with a distribution @xmath259 which leads to averages such as @xmath260 , then the average of the expression [ eq : forone ] ) gives @xmath261 leading to an exponential decay of the correlations of the density waves .",
    "this is due to the fact that this disorder introduces a random phase in the position of the oscillations of the density .",
    "paradoxically such a term does _ not _ lead to any localization of the bosons . indeed if one computes the current of bosons , it is given by @xmath262 .",
    "the transformation ( [ eq : transf ] ) thus leaves the current invariant and identical to the ones of pure bosons . from the point of view of the transport",
    "the system remains a superfluid .",
    "note also that the field @xmath80 is unchanged by the transformation ( [ eq : transf ] ) , which means that the superfluid correlations are identical to the ones of the pure system .",
    "a particularly transparent interpretation of this term can be inferred by looking at the tg limit , or simply at the comparison between the bosonized expressions for the bosons and the spinless fermions systems . as already noted in the tonks regime @xmath263 , where @xmath264 is the fermi wavevector .",
    "such a disorder thus corresponds to _ forward scattering _ where a fermion around @xmath265 remains around the same point of the fermi surface .",
    "it is now obvious that such a forward scattering can not essentially change the current and can not lead to localization .",
    "much more interesting effects arise from the other term , namely @xmath266\\ ] ] because @xmath5 is a smooth field it is easy to see that this term corresponds now to coupling of fourier components of the disorder with components around @xmath267 .",
    "one can thus rewrite @xmath268 where @xmath269 and",
    "the above equation defines @xmath270 .",
    "contrarily to @xmath241 @xmath270 is a smooth field with averages over disorder of the form @xmath271 if @xmath270 was simply constant , ( [ eq : disback ] ) would correspond to a commensurate periodic potential , and one would be back to the case of the mott transition explained in the previous section . the fact that @xmath241 is random makes the phase of the periodic modulation vary from different positions .",
    "we thus see that for the quantum system of bosons , this component of the disorder acts a little bit in a similar way than a periodic potential , trying to pin the charge density wave of bosons . however , because of these phases fluctuations the pinning is not perfect and varies from place to place , leading to a distorted charge modulation .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : backsimp ] .",
    "the fourier components of the disorder @xmath241 with wavevector close to @xmath152 is the one responsible for the localization and the formation of the bose glass .",
    "the full line shows the disorder , while the dashed line would be a periodic potential of wavevector @xmath272 .",
    "the disorder matches the periodicity of the bosons , thus acting in a similar way than a mott potential , but different portions of the system are shifted compared to the perfect periodic position .",
    "thus although there is pinning of the bosons , the density arrangement is not perfect .",
    "note that for this disorder the smeared density at wavelengthes much smaller than @xmath272 is essentially constant as indicated by the gray box .",
    "this mechanism of localization is thus quite different than the simple formation of puddles of bosons . ]",
    "one can also get a simple interpretation for this term by going to the tonks limit . indeed in that case this term represents a scattering by the disorder with a momentum close to @xmath273 .",
    "it is thus a backscattering term , where a right moving fermion is transformed into a left moving one and vice versa .",
    "it is thus clear that such a term affects the current .",
    "exact solutions for noninteracting fermions indeed shows that this term is the one responsible for anderson localization .    in order to solve for the generic boson system",
    ", we can , as for the mott transition , write the renormalization equations for the disorder and the interactions .",
    "the procedure to obtain them is detailed in @xcite .",
    "one finds .",
    "@xmath274 where @xmath275 and @xmath276 is the backward scattering .",
    "the phase diagram can be extracted from these equations , exactly in the same spirit than what was done for the mott transition in the previous section .",
    "the disorder is irrelevant for @xmath277 , that is , weakly repulsive bosons .",
    "one finds a localized phase for @xmath278 , that is , if the repulsion between the bosons is strong enough . on the separatrix between the two phases the parameter @xmath104 takes the universal value @xmath279 .",
    "thus , the correlation functions decay with _ universal _ exponents . for example",
    ", the single - particle correlation function decays with an exponent @xmath280 .",
    "this calculation thus point out the existence for the bosons of a localized phase .",
    "this phase , nicknamed bose glass , whose existence can be established microscopically in one dimension @xcite has been generalizable to higher dimensions as well @xcite . in one dimension , one can compute the critical properties of the transition between the superfluid and the bose glass .",
    "i refer the reader to @xcite for more details on that point .",
    "in particular the superfluid stiffness @xmath281 jumps discontinuously to zero in the bose glass phase and @xmath282 takes the universal value @xmath283 at the transition . at the transition",
    "the disorder is marginal .",
    "because of the dual nature of the phases @xmath5 and @xmath80 the fact that the phase @xmath5 is now pinned means that the superfluid correlations decay exponentially , with a characteristic length that is the localization length . one thus expects a lorentzian shape for the @xmath158 instead of the divergent powerlaw behavior of a luttinger liquid .",
    "the correlation length diverges at the transition to the superfluid phase .",
    "other methods can be used to extract information on the localized phase @xcite .",
    "this transition from the superfluid to the bose glass is a direct consequence of the interaction effects between the bosons .",
    "in particular the fact that one has a strongly correlated system is hidden in the conjugation relation between the phase @xmath5 and @xmath80 which forces the density fluctuations to be directly related to the superfluid ones . in higher dimensions , although the excitations of the superfluid phase @xmath80 can be described by sound waves , this would not imply much for the fluctuations of the density . in the bose glass phase ,",
    "the localization is very similar to the one for spinless fermions .",
    "the bosonic nature of the particles is not so important any more . to summarize , in order to be able to observe the localization for quantum interacting bosons , it is important to fulfill the following conditions    1 .",
    "have a disorder with sizeable fourier component close to the interboson periodicity . having a too smooth potential is of little help , since it can lead to some puddle separation if the disorder is strong but this is a very `` classical localization '' .",
    "the bose glass phase can also occur for weak disorder .",
    "2 .   have repulsive enough interactions between bosons . if @xmath284 even an infinitesimal disorder is able to localize",
    "of course one wants the localization length to be smaller than the size of the system , to observe the localization .",
    "the larger the disorder , the larger of course the value of @xmath104 at which the system localizes .",
    "one does not want to make the disorder too strong though ( not stronger than the chemical potential ) otherwise one is back to the puddle localization mentioned above .",
    "how to reach such limits in a realistic cold atomic system is of course a very challenging question .",
    "current system seem not one dimensional enough and/or with too smooth disorder to be in this quantum limit @xcite .",
    "one is close however and there is thus little doubts that such a state will be reached in a near future .",
    "there are many directions in which these questions of disorder acting on bosonic systems can be further studied .",
    "first for the disordered problem numerical studies have confirmed the analytical predictions and allowed to further study the phase diagram directly in terms of the microscopic parameters @xcite .",
    "it is clear that similar studies taking into account the peculiarities of the system ( trap etc . )",
    "would be very interesting in the context of cold atomic gases .",
    "second , in the previous section we saw the effect of a periodic potential .",
    "we saw that it is very efficient into opening a gap and leading to a mott insulating phase , but only if the filling is commensurate with the periodicity . on the other hand ,",
    "a random potential is slightly efficient in giving an insulating phase , but can act regardless of the density of bosons .",
    "a particularly interesting intermediate case is the case of quasi - periodic potentials .",
    "these potentials lead to a new universality class for the superfluid - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "similarly one expects very interesting effects when combining disorder and commensurability @xcite or going for more than one bosonic mode inside the tube .",
    "i refer for example the reader to the literature for other examples of interesting problems such as going to systems of coupled chains @xcite",
    ". it will be very interesting to see if some of these effects can be directly tested in a cold atomic gas context .",
    "i have shown in these brief notes some of the properties of interacting particles in one dimension .",
    "i have focussed principally on interacting one dimensional bosons .",
    "many more examples both on bosons and on other systems can be found in @xcite . among the many efficient methods both analytical and numerical to tackle one dimensional systems , i have chosen to present here a short account the bosonization method .",
    "it is one of the most versatile and physically transparent method .",
    "in addition to providing direct insight on the low energy properties of the system , it can also complement very well other angles of approach such as numerical ones . here again the avid reader will find other methods explained in @xcite .",
    "i have shown application of this method to two problems of importance in the rapidly growing field of cold atoms in optical lattices : the mott transition induced by the presence of a periodic potential on interacting bosons , and the localization of interacting bosons in the presence of a random potential .    despite an history of more than 40 years",
    "the one dimensional world thus continues to offer fascinating challenges . in",
    "that respect cold atomic gases have opened a cornucopia of possibilities to test for this fascinating physics .",
    "this is due both to the level of control offered by such system but also by their ability to deal with bosons , fermions or mixtures of them at will .",
    "it is clear that they have raised many more questions than the theorist had answers ready for , hence offering new playgrounds and challenges .",
    "under such an experimental pressure , there is thus little doubts that one can expect spectacular progress in the years to come .",
    "although these notes discuss about one dimensional systems , most of the material is centered around cold atomic physics .",
    "i thus would like to specially thank m. a. cazalilla , a. f. ho , a. iucci , c. kollath , with whom my own research in the field of cold atomic gases has been conducted , for the many enjoyable discussions and ongoing collaborations on this subject .",
