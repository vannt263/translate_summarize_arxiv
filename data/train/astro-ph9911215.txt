    "pulsating white dwarfs show brightness variations at a range of frequencies , with amplitudes of up to a few per cent .",
    "they appear to be normal white dwarfs , except for the fact that they lie in a special temperature range , or instability strip , in which they are unstable to pulsations .",
    "there are instability strips for all three of the main white dwarf types , da , db and do ( atmosphere dominated by , and , respectively ) , around 12000 , 23000 and 100000k , respectively .",
    "pulsating white dwarfs offer the prospect of physical insight via a number of different methods .",
    "one is asteroseismology , the determination of a white dwarf s internal structure through the comparison of observed periodicities with model predictions of stellar eigen - modes .",
    "another method analyses which modes are present , what their amplitudes are and how the amplitudes vary . the aim is to learn about the physics of the upper layers of the star , by determining the way in which modes interact with different parts of the star and with each other .",
    "robinson , kepler & nather ( @xcite ) showed that white dwarfs pulsate in non - radial gravity modes , and that the observed brightness variations result from perturbations of their temperature , not of their geometry or gravity .",
    "they also estimated the expected variations in the line - of - sight velocity and the line profile , and concluded that these would be too small to measure with then available instrumentation .",
    "as we will show below , this statement no longer holds .",
    "the pulsations were originally thought to be excited in an ionisation zone , as in classical pulsators such as the cepheids .",
    "the dynamics in da and db pulsating white dwarfs are rather unlike those in classical pulsators , however , in that for the white dwarfs the surface convection zone can respond almost instantaneously to gravity - mode pulsations , because the turnover times are much shorter than the mode periods . in a series of papers , brickhill",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) has described the response in detail , and concludes it leads to significant `` convective driving '' , which will be sufficient to overcome the damping in the radiative interior for modes with periods of order of or shorter than the thermal response time of the convection zone .",
    "brickhill s partly numerical results have recently been confirmed analytically ( wu @xcite ; goldreich & wu @xcite ) .",
    "the da and db pulsating white dwarfs often show power at frequencies that are the sums or differences of frequencies with stronger power . based on the density of the theoretical gravity - mode spectra in the relevant frequency range",
    ", it has been argued that these `` combination frequencies '' do not represent real eigen - modes , but are instead produced by nonlinear mixing of pulsation signals of real eigen - modes ( `` parent modes '' ) in the outer layer of the star .",
    "some support for this idea comes from observed correlations in power .",
    "brickhill ( @xcite , b ) has suggested that the mixing is a by - product of the interaction between the pulsations and the convection zone .",
    "because of the relatively slow thermal response of the convection zone , flux variations take some time to appear at the surface , and they are reduced in amplitude . but the thickness of the convection zone is modulated by the pulsation , so that the signal is not only diminished and delayed , but also distorted .",
    "it is the latter distortion which translates into the power seen at combination frequencies .    both to be able to make an asteroseismological analysis and to verify the pulsation models",
    ", it is essential to identify periodicities with eigen - modes , i.e. , obtain their radial order  , spherical degree  and azimuthal order  . for some db and do variables , it has been possible to obtain reasonably sound identifications from a direct comparison of observed frequencies with model predictions .",
    "however , for many other stars , including all da variables , there are either too few modes , or the mode structure is too variable .",
    "robinson et al .",
    "( ) implemented a method to identify spherical degree   , which combined broad - band measurements of mode amplitudes at optical and uv wavelengths .",
    "it makes use of the wavelength dependence of limb darkening , which causes the pulsation amplitudes to vary with wavelength in a manner that depends on   .",
    "based on its success , we were motivated to implement a variation of this method which uses high signal - to - noise time - resolved spectrophotometry at optical wavelengths only .",
    "as will become clear , our initial data on the star  showed variations not only in flux but also in line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the broadened scope , as well as the increased complexity in modeling the flux variation as a function of wavelength , made us decide to present the amplitudes and phases of the modes as a function of wavelength in a separate paper ( clemens et al.@xcite , hereafter paper  ii ) .    in this paper , we focus on the implications of the line - of - sight velocity variations .",
    "we first briefly review the basic properties of  ( ) , and then describe the observation and data reduction in detail ( ) . in , we analyse the periodicities in the light curve , and in we search for corresponding variations in the line - of - sight velocity curve .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in , both in a model - independent way and in the context of the convective driving models described above .",
    "[ [ sec : zzpsc ] ]    ( zz  psc ; wd  2326 + 029 ) was discovered as a variable by shulov & kopatskaya ( @xcite ) and studied in some detail by mcgraw and robinson ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is bright ( @xmath7 ) , at the cool end of the instability strip ( @xmath8k , bergeron et al .",
    "paper  ii ) and shows large - amplitude modulations ( up to a few per cent ) .",
    "the source remained relatively obscure until zuckerman & becklin ( @xcite ) reported an infrared excess , which is still unexplained ( for recent developments , see kleinman et al .  ; koester , provencal & shipman @xcite ) . in 1987",
    ", it was first subjected to scrutiny with the whole earth telescope ( wet ; winget et al .  ) . unlike for the variable dbs and dos , however , the observations  while of excellent quality  yielded more questions than answers .",
    "partly , this is because of the complex and variable frequency spectrum of : typically , dozens of periodicities are seen , with many occurring at frequencies that are differences or sums of the frequencies of other periodicities .",
    "kleinman et al .",
    "( ) discussed an extensive collection of data sets , obtained over many seasons .",
    "they find that many periodicities are variable and unstable from year to year , but some do recur . by considering the whole ensemble",
    ", they could identify with some certainty which periodicities were associated with real modes and which with combination frequencies .",
    "they found nineteen real modes , the majority of which very likely have @xmath9 .",
    "however , due to the vagaries of the mode characteristics  especially the enigmatic , confusing behavior of multiplets , showing different and changing splitting  their results are suggestive , but not definitive .",
    "spectra of  were taken on 1996 november 19 using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al .  ) on the 10-m keck  ii telescope . from 4:42 till 9:25",
    "ut , a continuous series of 700 12s exposures was made .",
    "only 100 pixels in the spatial direction ( corresponding to @xmath10arcsec ) , binned by a factor 2 , were read out through two amplifiers , leading to a read - out and re - set time in between exposures of about 12s .",
    "the @xmath11 grating was used , covering the range 34505950  at @xmath12 .",
    "the weather started photometric , and we used a @xmath13arcsec slit to make use of that .",
    "hence , the seeing of @xmath14arcsec determined the wavelength resolution of @xmath15 . in principle",
    ", it would have been best to keep the slit at the parallactic angle in order for refraction not to influence the wavelength scale , but this would have required non - standard guiding and we decided to keep the slit at position angle 0  instead .    at the end of the series ,",
    "a bank of cloudlets came in , causing the last 55 spectra , as well as one spectrum some ten minutes earlier , to have a reduced source and increased sky rate ( the moon was up , so these are easy to identify ) .",
    "we have not used any of these spectra in our analysis .",
    "the series of exposures was followed by fifteen 4s integrations on the spectrophotometric flux standard 191-b2b , using the same setup .",
    "each of the series was followed by hg / kr wavelength calibration and halogen flat - field frames .",
    "the reduction of all spectra was done as follows .",
    "the frames were bias - corrected separately for the two amplifiers using the overscan regions , and then corrected for the gain difference between the two amplifiers as determined from halogen spectra .",
    "the sky background was estimated by fitting parabolae for each position in the dispersion direction , excluding 21 binned pixels ( @xmath16 ) centred on the stellar spectrum .",
    "the latter pixels were used to estimate the stellar flux using an optimal weighting scheme similar to that of horne ( @xcite ) . note that we did not flat - field the data .",
    "the reason is that we had been unable , due to an instrument failure shortly after taking the exposures on g191-b2b , to obtain a large enough number of halogen spectra to construct a flat - field that matched the signal - to - noise ratio of our observations , especially in the blue . since the flat fields that we did have appeared very smooth , we decided to forego flat - fielding altogether",
    "the resulting spectra look smooth ( ) , except for a few pixels that are easy to identify .",
    "note the presence of metals ",
    "@xmath17 and  @xmath18  uncovered only recently by koester et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "accurate flux calibration was not possible , since the 191-b2b spectra were taken while the bank of cloudlets was still passing .",
    "we selected the three most exposed spectra of the series of fifteen acquired , as these have comparable count rates and hence may not be influenced too much , making the relative flux calibration more reliable magnitude of @xmath19 ( @xmath20mjy ; mccook & sion @xcite ) . ] . from these three , we derived the instrumental response using the model fluxes provided by bohlin , colina & finley ( @xcite ) , and the atmospheric extinction curve of beland , boulade & davidge ( @xcite ) .",
    "typical examples of relatively high and low - flux spectra , as well as the average spectrum , are shown in .",
    "special care was taken to correct the wavelength scale for instrumental effects due to flexure and atmospheric refraction .",
    "both effects can be seen in the pixel positions on the detector as a function of time of the  @xmath21 sky line and the balmer lines ( a ) . here , the positions were derived by cross - correlation of the spectra with the average of those spectra taken with the slit position angle less than 20  away from the parallactic angle .",
    "the break at @xmath22s in the balmer - line positions is due to guiding being stopped and re - started ( to take a guider image ) .",
    "the flexure is described well by a cubic fit to the sky - line positions .",
    "after correction for the flexure , as well as for the jump due to switching the guider off and on , the positions of the balmer lines vary linearly with what is expected from refraction ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the difference between parallactic and position angle , and @xmath25 the zenith distance ) .",
    "the different slopes indicate that our guiding wavelength was approximately 7000 , as expected for the ccd camera used .",
    "we used this value to calculate the wavelength corrections for the whole spectrum .",
    "since our spectra were taken through a wide slit , small movements of the star will result in random apparent wavelength shifts for individual spectra .",
    "the effect can be estimated by measuring the shifts along the slit from the spatial profiles ( averaged over some number of pixels along the dispersion direction ) .",
    "we find a root - mean - square variation in these of 0.084 binned pixels , corresponding to 0036 .",
    "assuming the variations in the dispersion direction are similar , one thus expects variations of about 0.2 , or 14  at h@xmath26 .",
    "apparent brightness variations can result from varying slit losses due to seeing - related changes in the width of the stellar images . from the spatial profiles , we find 10% root - mean - square variations around the average full width at half maximum of 3 binned pixels ( 12 ) .",
    "using images taken with lris for other projects , we estimate that the slit losses with an @xmath27 aperture are about 1% on average . assuming that the slit losses scale approximately quadratically with the seeing , one thus expects apparent brightness variations of the order of 0.2% . this is smaller than the poisson noise in individual wavelength elements , but dominates in the average light curve discussed below .",
    "it is also much larger than variations due to scintillation ( @xmath28 ; young @xcite ) .",
    "in b , we show the continuum light curve , constructed by averaging the 52005500  region .",
    "the light curve shows the presence of a number of periodicities , and is similar to light curves observed before ( see ) .",
    "the fourier transform is shown in a. most of the power is at frequencies below 6mhz .",
    "an idea of the background level can be obtained from the 1020mhz region ( see inset in figure ) , where little evidence for any periodicity is seen . in this region",
    ", we find a root - mean - square amplitude of about 0.025% .",
    "the corresponding root - mean - square variation is half that , and one infers root - mean - square variations in the fluxes of about @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the number of data points ) , more or less consistent with the estimate made above based on varying slit losses .",
    "we believe essentially all the signal seen in the main panel of a , which is well above 0.025% , reflects stellar variability .",
    "we identified the periodicities sequentially .",
    "we started by measuring the approximate frequency of the highest peak and fitting the data to a function of the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32:52:08ut is the time relative to the mid - observing time , solving for pulsation frequency @xmath33 , phase @xmath34 and amplitude @xmath35 , plus a constant offset @xmath36 .",
    "next , we identify the highest remaining peak in the fourier transform of the residuals and include another cosine wave in the fit , etc . for combination frequencies , we held the frequencies fixed at the corresponding combinations of parent - mode frequencies .",
    "the decision whether a peak corresponded to a combination frequency or to a real mode , was generally made consulting the work of kleinman ( @xcite ) ; in all cases , the amplitude of the combination frequency was the smallest of the peaks involved .",
    "continuing as long as the next largest peak had not been influenced greatly by removing the previous peaks , we found eleven periodicities with amplitudes larger than 0.55% .",

    "these are listed in and the corresponding peaks are identified in a. comparing our periodicities with those found by kleinman ( @xcite ) , we find that most periodicities have been seen before .",
    "the exceptions are : ( i ) f6 : power at 430s has only been seen as an apparent harmonic of a strong 860s mode ; ( ii ) f3+f1 : power at f1 ( 614s ) and f3 ( 653s ) has not been seen simultaneously before , and hence neither has this combination ( although power at 317s due to a different combination has been observed ) ; and ( iii ) f2@xmath48f1 and f3@xmath48f1 : at 2469 and 10322s , these periods are longer than any generally considered ( the identification of f3@xmath48f1 should be considered tentative here too ) .",
    "absent is power at 400s , which has been present in almost all observations so far .    from the residuals",
    ", it is clear that the eleven modes do not account well for the observed light curve ( with our estimate of 0.2% root - mean - square uncertainties , we find a formal @xmath49 ) .",
    "we have tried continuing the identification process ( see appendix ) , but fail to account for all the variability .",
    "therefore , we decided to focus on the eleven modes for which we have full confidence .",
    "we note , however , that because of the additional power and the resulting non - normal deviations , the formal errors on the parameters are not very meaningful .",
    "to get an idea of relative uncertainties , we have scaled up the errors on the data points such that the reduced @xmath50 equals unity .",
    "a puzzling aspect of our results is that the three largest periodicities appear to have frequencies related to each other by simple integer ratios : @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "both are correct to within 0.2% . after identifying more modes and including these in the fit ( see appendix ) ,",
    "the ratios become more accurate ( to within 0.1% ) . furthermore",
    ", another mode , f8 , is identified for which @xmath53 , again to within 0.1% .",
    "similar close coincidences have not been found in the observations of kleinman ( @xcite ) and it may be that they are in some way due to our relatively short time span , perhaps in combination with the badness of the fit , especially near the light maxima ( see b ) . on the other hand , these ratios may represent unexplored physics underlying the pulsation spectrum . for the present time , we will ignore possible complications arising from this .",
    "the positions of the balmer lines on the detector , as derived by the cross - correlations described in , appear to show modulation on time - scales similar to those shown by the light curve ( see a ) .",
    "this modulation might reflect apparent variations in the line - of - sight velocity of . in order to study this in more detail",
    ", we determined doppler shifts for all the spectra by fitting the h@xmath54 , h@xmath26 and h@xmath55 lines ( details in below ) .",
    "the resulting line - of - sight velocity curve is shown in c ( upper curve ) .",
    "the fourier spectrum , shown in b , shows one strong peak , at a frequency of @xmath56hz , i.e. , consistent with that of the strongest periodicity in the light curve .",
    "inspired by the close correspondence between the frequencies of these signals , we looked for power at frequencies corresponding to the other ten periodicities in the light curve and found small peaks at some but not all of them ( ) .",
    "we determined their amplitudes and phases by fitting the velocity curve with a combination of eleven cosine waves with frequencies fixed at those determined from the light curve ( plus a third - order polynomial to account for slow variations ) .",
    "the results are listed in and indicated in b ; the residuals are shown in c ( bottom curve ) .",
    "note that unlike for the light curve , the fit to the line - of - sight velocities is formally acceptable ( @xmath57 ) and we expect our error estimates to be reliable .",
    "could these line - of - sight velocity variations reflect pulsational motion ?",
    "the pulsations are g - modes and the associated motion is largely horizontal ( e.g. , dziembowski @xcite ) . the observed line - of - sight velocity , i.e.",
    ", the physical velocities projected on the light of sight and integrated over the stellar disk , will thus be dominated by motion near the limb .",
    "the observed amplitude will be smaller than the physical velocity amplitude by an amount depending on the spherical degree    and the direction of the pulsation axis relative to the observer .",
    "robinson et al .",
    "( @xcite ) estimated the expected line - of - sight velocity amplitudes for typical pulsation amplitudes and found that they should be a few .",
    "this is comparable to the amplitudes we find .",
    "if we suppose that the line - of - sight velocity variations reflect horizontal motion associated with the white dwarf pulsation , it is very interesting that all five apparently significant detections ( @xmath58 ) are for periodicities we identified as real modes above ; no significant detections are found for the combination frequencies .",
    "before we turn to the implications , however , we need to verify that our error estimates are reasonable and the velocity detections significant ; and if so , whether the inferred line - of - sight velocities reflect intrinsic velocity variations rather than some systematic effect in our measurement procedure . we will address these two points in turn .",
    "looking at b , all peaks but that associated with f1 look insignificant .",
    "indeed , they would be formally insignificant if one did not know the frequency at which to look in advance .",
    "however , the pulsation frequencies are determined accurately from the light curve . in the absence of systematic effects ( considered separately in )",
    ", a rough estimate for the significance of a peak with a certain amplitude at a frequency specified in advance can be made by counting the number of other peaks in the velocity spectrum at or above that amplitude .",
    "for instance , there are 13 peaks with amplitudes above 2  at frequencies below 7mhz ( b ) . with a frequency resolution of @xmath59hz ,",
    "the total number of independent frequency elements in this frequency range is 109 , and thus the probability of finding a @xmath60 peak by chance at a given frequency is roughly 1:8 .",
    "one would estimate 1:14 if one counts peaks up to the nyquist frequency ( 21mhz ; 23 peaks over 2  in 322 [ @xmath61 frequency elements ) .",
    "thus , f2 , f3 and f4 , all of which have amplitudes in excess of @xmath62 , are likely real .",
    "there is no other peak as large as f1 , hence the probability that it is a chance coincidence is @xmath63 .    in order to obtain more quantitative estimates , we ran monte - carlo simulations , in which we fitted scrambled velocity curves in the same way as we fitted the observations .",
    "the scrambled curves were created by first taking out the slow third - order variation in the measured doppler shifts , and then re - distributing the resulting velocities randomly over the measurement times . by counting the number of artificial data sets for which the fit produces an amplitude larger than that observed",
    ", one can infer the likelihood of a false detection .",
    "the likelihood distributions for all periodicities but f3@xmath48f1 are consistent with each other ( because of its long period , f3@xmath48f1 is covariant with the third - order polynomial , and its likelihood distribution is wider ) . in , we show the cumulative distribution of the amplitudes for all modes but f3@xmath48f1 derived from one thousand simulations .",
    "we also indicate the observed amplitudes .",
    "we infer that f1 , f2 , f3 and f4 are detected at the @xmath64 , 98 , 98 and 95% confidence levels , respectively ; f5 is marginally detected ( @xmath65 confidence ) ; and the signals at all other periodicities are not significant .    as mentioned above , the fit to the line - of - sight velocities is formally acceptable ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the errors , dominated by the star wandering around in the slit ( ) , should be more or less normally distributed , and thus our error estimates likely reasonable .",
    "indeed , from the simulations one infers similar numbers : @xmath66^{1/2}\\simeq0.8\\,\\kms$ ] ( where the factor @xmath67 accounts for the random phase ) , and @xmath68deg .",
    "the exception is f3@xmath48f1 , for which @xmath69 , indicating that the uncertainty for this periodicity is underestimated in the least - squares fit ( ) . this reflects the large covariance with the third - order polynomial .",
    "while the error estimates should be reliable , we caution that the uncertainty distributions are not expected to be normal .",
    "this is a consequence of our choice of parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "for instance , from , the uncertainty on @xmath71 is 28  for f5 . the @xmath72 uncertainty , however",
    ", is far larger than 56 : indeed , at 95% confidence @xmath71 can have any value , as the detection of velocity variations at f5 is significant at @xmath73 confidence .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath74 and @xmath75 are normally distributed , and one can use these to determine reliable uncertainty estimates for @xmath70 and @xmath71 at different confidence levels . note that the same holds for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , but the more significant detections make this less of an issue .",
    "above , we have shown that at frequencies at which the flux of the star varies strongly , significant variations are also present in the line - of - sight velocity curve .",
    "the question that remains is whether these variations reflect the intrinsic motion in the white dwarf s outer layers expected from the estimates of robinson et al.(@xcite ) , or whether they might be biased or perhaps even result from inadequacies in the way we determined the velocities . for instance , through changes in continuum slope , the measured doppler shift might be influenced by the variations in temperature with pulsation phase .    for any systematic effect related to the flux variations ,",
    "the line - of - sight velocity variations have to be either in phase or in anti - phase with the light variations , i.e. , the phase difference between velocity and light @xmath78 or @xmath79deg .",
    "this is not what we observe : for f1 , @xmath80deg .",
    "thus , no more than @xmath81 could be related to systematic effects of this kind .",
    "the component out of phase with the light variations has an amplitude of @xmath82 , which we can be confident is real given the results of the monte - carlo simulations ( ) .",
    "while the above shows that at least part of the line - of - sight velocity signals are intrinsic to the star , the component of the variation that is in phase or anti - phase with the light variations may still be influenced .",
    "in order to get a handle on the importance of possible systematics , we tried different methods to determine the line - of - sight velocities , looked at differences between the velocities inferred for different lines , and tried fitting artificial data generated with the models described in paper  ii .",
    "we found that cross - correlation was very susceptible to systematics .",
    "for instance , the line - of - sight velocity amplitudes derived from the cross - correlation discussed in ( a ) are systematically different for different balmer lines , both in phase and in amplitude .",
    "most likely , this reflects the influence of the varying temperature and hence continuum slope , which is not accounted for in the cross - correlation procedure . to get unbiased velocities",
    ", one needs to normalize all spectra , but it is not clear how to do this properly .",
    "we therefore focused on line - profile fitting , of h@xmath54 , h@xmath26 and h@xmath55 ( in the wavelength intervals 46225102 , 42204540 and 40404200 , respectively ) .",
    "to each line , we fitted a sum of a lorentzian and a gaussian profile , with their central wavelengths forced to be the same , and a continuum represented by either a linear or a parabolic function .",
    "we tried fitting to @xmath83 in addition to fitting to @xmath84 directly , the rationale being that since absorption is a multiplicative rather than an additive process , a sum of components can represent @xmath83 better than @xmath84 .    for all types of fits ,",
    "the resulting line - of - sight velocity curves were fitted with the combination of eleven cosine waves .",
    "the results were systematically different from those inferred from the cross - correlation velocities , with amplitudes generally being somewhat smaller , and phase differences between light and velocity being further away from zero .",
    "the systematic differences between lines were smaller , but not absent .",
    "no apparent effects are present in the derived phases for the different periodicities , but the amplitudes increase systematically from h@xmath54 to h@xmath26 to h@xmath55 . also , the zero points ( i.e. , systemic velocities ) derived for the different lines are very different .",
    "this is probably unrelated , however , as we find similar differences in systemic velocity for our flux standard 191b2b , which has much narrower lines .",
    "instead , it likely reflects problems with the wavelength calibration , possibly related to the way the light of the arc lamp is projected on the slit ( t.  bida , 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "such an effect should not affect the results for the periodic variations in velocity .",
    "this leaves the systematic differences in the amplitudes found for the individual balmer lines .",
    "we can discard the possibility that these are intrinsic to the star based on a simple analytic derivation : while the intrinsic velocity and light variations are not independent , their dependency is only a second - order effect and hence very small ( paper  ii ) .",
    "most likely , therefore , the observed systematic effects in amplitude are still related to our way of fitting , perhaps simply because our choice of lorentzian plus gaussian is an inadequate model for the observed line profiles .    to get a better handle on the problem , we fitted a number of artificial data sets , produced using the procedures described in paper  ii , for different settings of temperature amplitude , horizontal surface velocity amplitude , phase difference between light and velocity , and spherical degree .    for all artificial data sets and fitting methods ,",
    "the results for the different lines showed systematic differences of comparable magnitude to those seen in the real data .",
    "a set with zero input temperature variation gave the same velocity amplitude and phase for all three lines , as should be the case , but different systemic velocity , with h@xmath26 being close to zero , and h@xmath54 and h@xmath55 being negative and positive , respectively , by an amount that depended on the fitting method .",
    "the amount was smaller for fitting @xmath83 than for fitting @xmath84 directly , as expected ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 for h@xmath54 , h@xmath26 , h@xmath55 , respectively ) .    for data sets with non - zero temperature variations ,",
    "h@xmath26 again reproduced the input values best , in the sense that the systemic value was still closest to zero , and the velocity phase delay closest to the input value .",
    "h@xmath54 and h@xmath55 tended to lower and higher amplitude and to larger and smaller phase delay , respectively , with the values for both amplitude and phase being more or less symmetric around those for h@xmath26 . from a set with no velocity variations put in ,",
    "we find that for a temperature variation corresponding to 2.8% modulation at 5500 , the apparent velocity shifts in h@xmath54 and h@xmath55 are about @xmath88 in amplitude .",
    "the systematic differences with h@xmath26 for sets including velocity variations are consistent with this . the amplitude should be compared with the observed radial velocity amplitude of @xmath89 and the uncertainty of @xmath90 .",
    "given the results on the artificial data and taking into account that the observed velocity signals have low signal - to - noise , we decided to use the average of the h@xmath54 , h@xmath26 and h@xmath55 velocities , determined by fitting to @xmath83 ( with a linear slope for the continuum ) .",
    "the resulting line - of - sight velocity curve is the one discussed above and shown in c. it has uncertainties dominated by the effects of the star wandering around in the slit . given the simulations with the artificial data , we feel reasonably confident that systematic effects in the fitted amplitudes and phases will be smaller than the quoted uncertainties derived from the least - squares fit ( as listed in ) . for completeness , we note that the result would be similar if one were to use the velocities derived from h@xmath26 only .",
    "we conclude that we have detected line - of - sight velocity variations which are due to intrinsic processes in the white dwarf , and which have amplitudes comparable with those expected from the integration over the visible disk of the surface motion due to the pulsations ( robinson et al .",
    "we have shown that our estimates of the uncertainties are robust and that systematic effects , while problematic , most likely will be within these uncertainties . out of the eleven strongest modes present in the light curve ,",
    "five out of six of the real modes show significant modulation , while none of the combination frequencies does , even though f2+f1 and 2f2 have light amplitudes similar to those of the weaker real modes f4 and f5 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the observational results for the real modes and the combination frequencies in some detail . for each group , we describe the general properties we regard as important , mention what can be understood from geometrical arguments alone , and discuss the results in the context of convective - driving models .",
    "we mentioned already that only the real modes show significant modulation in the line - of - sight velocities .",
    "as measures of the relative amplitudes and phases of velocity and light , we use @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( see ) . here , @xmath70 and @xmath76 are the observed line - of - sight velocity and fractional light amplitudes , @xmath71 and @xmath77 the corresponding phases , and @xmath33 the frequency of the mode . the ratio  does not depend on azimuthal order  and aspect ( see dziembowski @xcite ; paper  ii ) .",
    "the rationale for including @xmath33 is that with this definition  depends only on spherical degree    for adiabatic pulsations . for adiabatic pulsations ,",
    "one also has @xmath93 , i.e. , velocity maximum arrives a quarter cycle after light maximum .    from , we see that the values of both  and  show no significant variation among the different real modes .",
    "all values of  are between 0 and 90 , i.e. , velocity lags light , but by less than a quarter cycle .",
    "the largest value of  is found for mode  f4 . while the difference with the values for the other modes is not formally significant , we note that a larger value is consistent with this mode having @xmath94 and the others @xmath9 , as inferred in paper  ii from the wavelength dependences of the pulsation amplitudes .",
    "compared to an @xmath9 mode , the light variations for an @xmath94 mode are subject to stronger cancellation , while the surface velocities are actually easier to observe ( see dziembowski @xcite ) .    in the interior of a white dwarf , pulsation associated with a real mode should be largely adiabatic ; maximum flux coincides with maximum compression and is followed a quarter cycle later by matter moving away at maximum velocity .",
    "this will change as the mode propagates upward and enters the outer regions , where non - adiabatic effects become important . using the observed relations between light and line - of - sight velocity variations",
    ", we can therefore hope to infer properties of the surface layers .    in the convective - driving picture ( brickhill @xcite ; goldreich & wu @xcite ) , the main source of change is the surface convection zone .",
    "as this region bottles up heat when it is heated , the flux perturbations at the photosphere of the star are diminished in magnitude and delayed in phase compared to those entering the bottom of the convection zone .",
    "in contrast , the horizontal velocities associated with the pulsation are nearly independent of depth inside the convection zone , because of the strong turbulent viscosity ( brickhill @xcite ; goldreich & wu @xcite ) .",
    "thus , values of  should be larger than those expected for adiabatic pulsations , and values of  smaller than 90 .",
    "the effects are expected to become more prominent with increasing values of @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the angular frequency of the mode and @xmath97 is the so - called thermal adjustment time ( goldreich & wu @xcite ; quantity @xmath98 in brickhill @xcite ) , which is a few times the thermal time at the bottom of the convection zone . with increasing mode frequency , therefore ,  should increase and  should deviate more and more from 90 , tending towards  0 .    indeed , the observed values of  are smaller than 90  and those for  larger by a factor 23 than expected if one were to neglect non - adiabatic effects ( e.g. , @xmath99 for mode  f1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the observations do not allow one to verify the predicted trends , but it may be worth noting that , if anything ,  shows a trend opposite to that predicted , i.e. , less of a deviation from 90  for shorter periods .",
    "we remind the reader that the errors in  are not distributed normally ( ) .",
    "it is difficult to make a more quantitative comparison , as this requires evaluating the thermal adjustment time @xmath97 , which depends on details of the convection .",
    "ideally , one would like to use  and  to estimate @xmath97 and thus constrain the convection properties .",
    "our data only allow a rough determination : a 800-s mode in a star with @xmath100s has @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( wu & goldreich @xcite ) , similar to what is observed for mode  f2 .",
    "an independent constraint to @xmath97 can be inferred from the longest - period mode that is present .",
    "this is because to excite a gravity - mode , the convection zone needs to extend deep enough for its thermal response time to be of order of or longer than the mode period , i.e. , @xmath103 ( brickhill @xcite ; goldreich & wu @xcite ) .",
    "the longest - period mode is f2 at 818s ( or f7 at 1106s ; see appendix ) , and thus @xmath104s ( @xmath105s ) , consistent with the above value .",
    "consistent estimates of @xmath97 are also obtained using combination frequencies ( see below ) .",
    "the lack of line - of - sight velocity signals at the frequencies which we associate with combinations of real modes , confirms the notion that combination frequencies do not reflect physical pulsation , but rather mixing of the parent - mode signals by a non - linear transformation occurring in the outer layers of the white dwarf .",
    "we quantify the combination frequencies using an amplitude ratio @xmath106 and a phase difference @xmath107 . here ,",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 are the observed amplitude and phase of a combination at frequency @xmath110 of real modes @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( with frequencies @xmath113 and @xmath114 , amplitudes @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and phases @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) ; @xmath119 is the number of possible permutations : @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 ;",
    "@xmath111 and @xmath112 are chosen such that difference frequencies are positive .",
    "we include @xmath119 to ensure that the harmonic of a single mode and a combination of two modes with almost identical properties would lead to the same  ( cf .",
    "brickhill @xcite ) .",
    "similar definitions are used for the 3-mode combinations ( see ) ; below , we focus on combinations of two modes .",
    "the observed values of  and  ( tables  [ tab : freqs ] and  [ tab : freqs - app ] ) vary significantly from mode to mode , although part of the variation is due to only a few outliers ( especially 2f4 , which we will discuss in more detail below ) .",
    "there appears to be some correlation between the value of  and the amplitudes of the parent modes , with  increasing for decreasing  @xmath124 .",
    "the phase differences  cluster around zero ( within @xmath125 ) ; this reflects the sharp maxima and shallow minima in the light curve .",
    "if the combination frequencies indeed result from nonlinear mixing in the upper layers of the star , then independent of a specific theory one expects a combination frequency to have at any point on the surface a flux amplitude proportional to the product of its parent - mode amplitudes at that point .",
    "the surface distributions of the parent modes are described by spherical harmonics .",
    "therefore , the surface distribution of the combination frequency will be proportional to the product of spherical harmonics , which can in turn be described by a linear superposition of spherical harmonics with different  (see , e.g. , abramowitz & stegun @xcite ; we adopt their notation ) .    in the following discussion",
    ", we will assume all parent modes have only @xmath126 components .",
    "we consider the more general case later .",
    "first , we study the first harmonic of a single parent mode .",
    "the first harmonic of a parent mode with @xmath127 has a surface distribution described by @xmath128 , which can be decomposed into a sum of @xmath129 and @xmath130 distributions .",
    "the first harmonic of a parent mode with @xmath131 has a surface distribution that is the sum of three components , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath132 .",
    "the numerical factors in front of the @xmath129 terms are the same for both decompositions .",
    "when integrated over the visible hemisphere , the ( 2,0 ) parent mode will suffer stronger cancellation than the ( 1,0 ) parent mode . on the other hand , their harmonics will typically be dominated by @xmath129 components that do not suffer from cancellation .",
    "therefore ,  will be higher for the harmonic of the ( 2,0 ) mode .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the the angle between the line - of - sight and the pulsation axis .    in , the value of  for 2f4 is much larger than , e.g. , that for 2f1 and 2f2 .",
    "while we should caution that 2f4 could be blended with other combinations , this is exactly what one would expect from the example given above , given our identifications of f1 and f2 with @xmath9 and f4 with @xmath94 ( paper  ii ) .",
    "note that one would not expect , e.g. , f4+f1 to have a value of  larger than those for combinations of two @xmath9 modes , such as f2+f1 , f3+f1 and f5+f1 ( as observed ; ) .",
    "this is because the product @xmath133 has no @xmath129 component and therefore suffers cancellation .",
    "looking in detail at  for all combinations involving f1 and another @xmath9 mode , e.g. , 2f1 , f2+f1 , we find that the values are not consistent with being the same .",
    "there appears to be a trend of increasing  with decreasing parent - mode amplitude .",
    "a similar trend appears to be present for the 3-mode combination frequencies .",
    "this is not expected , as generally the efficiency of mixing should be relatively independent of the amplitudes of the input signals when these signals are weak .",
    "we should caution that above we have been neglecting the possible effect of different values of  . for instance , the harmonic of a @xmath9 , @xmath134 parent mode is described by a @xmath135 distribution only ; it would have a low value of . in our short observations",
    ", we can not resolve the rotation - induced frequency splitting among different  components that has been seen previously for some of the modes ( kleinman et al .  ) .",
    "thus , the power at both the harmonic and its parent mode may result from a number of combinations , which makes our conclusions uncertain .",
    "they can likely be verified , however , using existing , much longer time series from wet .",
    "we now turn from these general considerations , valid for any local nonlinear mixing scheme , to a comparison of our data with numerical results and analytic calculations based on the convective - driving mechanism . as mentioned , in this picture flux perturbations appearing at the photosphere",
    "are diminished and delayed relative to those that enter the convection zone , by an amount that depends on the depth of the convection zone ( and thus @xmath97 ) .",
    "the depth of the convection zone , however , depends sensitively on the photospheric temperature .",
    "the latter varies due to the pulsations , and , therefore , the depth of the convection will vary as well .",
    "the associated variation in reduction and delay leads to a distortion of the pulsation signal at the photosphere , which translates into the power seen at the combination frequencies ( brickhill @xcite ; wu @xcite ) .",
    "brickhill ( @xcite ) found that  will be @xmath136 for the first harmonic of an @xmath127 mode and @xmath137 for that of a ( 2,0 ) mode , the exact values depending on the frequencies , @xmath97 and the angle between the line of sight and the pulsation axis .",
    "he found sum frequencies share similar values of  with the harmonics .",
    "] , while difference frequencies from the same pair of parent modes have lower values .",
    "these results were confirmed analytically by wu ( @xcite ) , who found that for combinations with relatively high frequency ( @xmath138 ) ,  should be approximately constant and  approximately zero , while towards lower frequencies ( @xmath139 ) ,  should be lower and should shift towards  @xmath140 .",
    "the observed values of  and  compare , on average , favourably to the expectations .",
    "the typical values of  are reproduced with @xmath141s  ( wu @xcite ) , which is consistent with the values of @xmath97 inferred above from the longest - period overstable mode and the velocity - light comparison ( ) .",
    "little evidence is found for the expected trends of either  or  with frequency of the combinations . in part",
    ", this might be due to our inability to resolve components of different  .",
    "again , it would be good to verify these conclusions with longer time series , such as those already available from wet .",
    "as mentioned , a trend of  with parent - mode amplitude is not expected in any simple non - linear mixing theory ( e.g. , wu  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the numerical calculations presented by brickhill ( @xcite ) show an amplitude dependence of for 3-mode combinations that is similar to that observed ( and with similar numerical values ) . at present",
    ", we do not understand why this dependence arises in the simulations ; unfortunately , brickhill does not expand on it .",
    "we have applied the tool of time - resolved spectrophotometry to the study of pulsating white dwarfs . in this paper",
    ", we showed that at our very high signal - to - noise ratios we can detect the small line - of - sight velocity variations associated with the g - mode pulsations , at amplitudes similar to those expected ( robinson et al.@xcite ) .",
    "significant velocity variation is seen for five out of the six modes we believed were real .",
    "for all five modes , the phase difference  between velocity and light is between 0 and 90 , i.e. , velocity maximum occurs later than flux maximum , but by less than the quarter cycle expected for adiabatic pulsations .",
    "the amplitude ratios  are similar for the five modes .",
    "the largest value occurs for mode  f4 ( at 776s ) , which is consistent with mode f4 having @xmath94 and the others @xmath9 , as was inferred from the wavelength dependence of the pulsation amplitudes in paper  ii .",
    "no significant line - of - sight velocity variation is seen for any of the five combination frequencies , even though two of these have light amplitudes comparable to that of the fourth strongest real mode .",
    "this provides independent confirmation that the combination frequencies do not reflect physical pulsation .",
    "rather , they likely result from mixing of mode power by a non - linear transformation in the outer layers of the star .",
    "the phase differences  between combination frequencies and parent modes are all close to zero , reflecting the sharp maxima and shallow minima in the light curve .",
    "the amplitude ratios  show significant differences , but are generally within a factor two of each other .",
    "the exception is the four times larger value for the harmonic of mode  f4 .",
    "this difference is again consistent with the differences in    between mode f4 and the others .",
    "models for the interaction between pulsation and convection can broadly reproduce the observed values of  and  for the real modes , as well as those of  and  for the combination frequencies ( brickhill @xcite ; wu @xcite ) .",
    "the models are internally consistent , in that the inferred thermal properties of the convection zone are such that modes at the observed periods are expected to be overstable . in detail , there are some problems , with  showing a trend with frequency opposite of that expected , and the mixing strength , reflected in , not showing the expected correlation with frequency , but rather a possible dependency on parent - mode amplitude . both these need confirmation ; for the former , further time - resolved spectroscopy is needed , but for the latter , excellent data already exist .",
    "we also hope that our results will lead to further theoretical efforts .    in summary ,",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy offers insight in the white dwarf interiors at three levels . by measuring the effects of temperature variation at different wavelengths , the temperature structure of the atmosphere can be calibrated . using the velocity changes and the combination frequencies",
    ", one can constrain the convection zone below the photosphere . and",
    "finally , with the determination of the spherical degree and hence the more secure identifications of periodicities with eigen - modes , one can use asteroseismology to probe the interior with greater confidence .",

    "we conclude with a few remarks .",
    "first , we note that possible significant periodicity is also present for 2f3 ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) and f5+f2 ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) , while no significant signal is seen at 2f5 ( @xmath150 , @xmath151 ) .",

    "these may indeed be present , but their frequencies are so close to other combinations that it is impossible to include them in the fit . which of the possible combinations one uses is a matter of choice .",
    "we have been biased by theory in preferring those for which the parent modes have larger amplitudes , or , if similar , those for which the fitted value of  was closest to  0 .",
    "second , the periodicity f9 , which is very close to f1 in period , is rather uncertain .",
    "the modulation could be fitted equally well with a variable amplitude for  f1 .",
    "if f9 is real , it should have @xmath153 given its proximity to f1 , which has @xmath9 .",
    "if it has @xmath94 and a substantial @xmath126 component , one might expect a large harmonic , like for  f4 .",
    "this harmonic might in part account for the peak now described by f9+f1 ; if we fit 2f9 instead ( we can not fit both jointly ) , we find @xmath154 , @xmath155 , which corresponds to @xmath156 , similar to that of 2f4 , but @xmath157 , much further removed from zero than for any other combination frequency .    finally , while for most combination frequencies we do not find significant velocity variation , there are two exceptions : f4@xmath48f1 at 2900s and f6@xmath48f1 at 1447s .",
    "these two periodicities appear harmonically related to each other , and we believe the associated velocity signals reflect either instrumental or atmospheric effects rather than physical variations .",
