    "structure functions , which can be extracted from deep - inelastic experiments , are useful tools to understand the structure of hadrons .",
    "even if their @xmath5 evolution is consistent with perturbative qcd , they result mainly from non - perturbative effects that are still not calculable in the framework of qcd . this has led to phenomenological quark models embodying various non - perturbative aspects of qcd .",
    "these models can be used to depict the behaviour of the structure functions and to understand the connection between data and non - perturbative aspects of hadrons .",
    "there has been extensive work on diagonal distributions along these lines ( see refs  @xcite-@xcite for the pion case ) .",
    "these distributions can be used as the initial condition for a dglap evolution , which is necessary before a comparison with data  @xcite .",
    "such models can be applied to the off - diagonal case , for which generalised structure functions  @xcite can be linked  @xcite to generalised parton distributions ( gpd s ) .",
    "one of the setbacks of phenomenological quark models suited to the description of the low - energy features of hadrons is that the underlying quark structure is obscured by the necessary introduction of regularisation procedures which result in non - negligible differences in the structure functions .    to avoid these complications , we investigated the diagonal structure functions in the case of a simple model for the pion  @xcite , where the pion - quark - antiquark pseudoscalar coupling ( @xmath6 ) yields the correct symmetry , while the non - perturbative aspects come from a momentum cut - off mimicking the size of the pion , but still preserving gauge invariance .",
    "this freed us from the question of what would be the detailed inner structure of the meson . in that calculation , owing to the introduction of such a cut - off , crossed diagrams for the pion - photon scattering appear as higher twists , leading twist structure functions can be identified , and a reduction of the momentum fraction carried by the quarks is observed .",
    "of course , as the cut - off is relaxed to let the quarks behave freely , the momentum sum rule @xmath7 is recovered at infinite @xmath5 . having that tool at hand , we now turn to the investigation of the properties of off - diagonal parton distributions , which are likely to shed some light on parton correlations and which have therefore attracted much interest in recent years  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we calculate the imaginary part of the off - forward photon - pion scattering amplitude , and of the structure functions @xmath8 , related to the five independent tensor structures in the scattering amplitude , and we discuss their behaviour .",
    "we relate them to vector and axial vector form factors and to the twist - two and twist - three generalised parton distributions ( gpd s ) @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we shall show that , within our model and in the high-@xmath5 limit , the non - diagonal structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related to @xmath11 , while @xmath12 happens to be a higher twist .",
    "these results lead to new relations for the gpd s in the neutral pion case .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the momenta of the ingoing and outgoing pions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 those of the corresponding photons ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : diagrams ] ) .",
    "defining @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , one can then write the scattering amplitude as a function of the lorentz invariants @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    in the elastic limit , characterised by @xmath25 ,",
    "one has @xmath26 and thus @xmath27 , while the diagonal limit ( @xmath28 ) is obtained for @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",

    ", @xmath32 is related to @xmath33 through @xmath34 .",
    "hence in the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) limit , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .      the hadronic tensor is defined through @xmath38    there exist five independent kinematical structures in eq .",
    "( [ deftmunu ] ) that parametrise the photon - pion amplitude . defining the projector @xmath39 and making use of these five structures ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath40 as follows : @xmath41    current conservation is ensured by means of the projector @xmath42 .",
    "our notation slightly differs from ref .",
    "@xcite : we have included a factor @xmath43 in the definition of @xmath12 in order to avoid divergences when the chiral limit is taken . note that bose symmetry requires @xmath11 , @xmath44 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 to be even and @xmath9 to be odd in @xmath32 .",
    "we use the pion model introduced in our previous work  @xcite , in which the @xmath45 vertex is represented by the simplest pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "the lagrangian includes massive pion and massive quark fields interacting through the pseudoscalar vertex , with an effective pion - quark coupling constant .",
    "considering an isospin triplet pion field @xmath46 interacting with quark fields @xmath47 the lagrangian density reads @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the isospin vector operator .",
    "of course , if our pseudoscalar field is to represent real pions , we have to impose that the corresponding hadrons have a finite size . that we shall do through the use of a cut - off , as detailed below , the choice of which sets a constraint on the value of the quark - pion coupling constant  @xcite .    we shall limit ourselves in this paper to the calculation of the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude , which allows a direct comparison with our previous work and which is sufficient to determine the gpd s of neutral pions @xcite .    at the leading order in the loop expansion , four diagrams contribute .",
    "they are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] . following the kinematics defined in section  [ subsec : kinematics ] and applying feynman rules , it is straightforward to write down the analytical expression for the scattering amplitude . for a given",
    "set @xmath50 of the photon indices and with well - known conventions corresponds to the following choice of the isospin matrix : @xmath51 ; @xmath52 ; @xmath53 ; @xmath54 , the contribution of the first diagram ( a ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] to the scattering amplitude reads    @xmath55    expressions from the other three diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ]  the one with reverse loop - momentum and the two crossed diagrams  are similar and are not written down .",
    "results below all pertain to the chiral limit @xmath56 .      a simple way to impose that the pion has a finite size is to require that the square of the relative four - momentum of the quarks inside the pion is limited to a maximum value @xmath57 . before writing this explicitly ,",
    "let us give the details of the internal kinematics , _",
    "i.e. _ the one involving the loop - momentum @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 and @xmath60 be the spherical angles of @xmath61 with respect to the @xmath62-axis taken as the direction of the incoming photon . defining @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and using spherical coordinates , we write the element of integration as : @xmath65 or with the help of the variable @xmath66 : @xmath67    according to cutkosky rules , the imaginary part of the amplitude is obtained by putting the intermediate quark lines on shell .",
    "this is realised by the introduction of the two delta functions , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "working out the delta functions , we obtain that : @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "finally , the element of integration over the internal momentum , considering only the imaginary part of the amplitude , reads : @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "the boundary values of the integration domain on @xmath66 are obtained by solving @xmath75 .",
    "now we may look at the effect of the finite size of the pion on the integration procedure upon @xmath58 . the relative four - momentum squared of the quarks inside the pion",
    "is given by    @xmath76    for pion - quark vertices like the ones in diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams].(a ) , and by    @xmath77    for vertices as in diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams].(b ) .",
    "note that @xmath78 is a known function of the external variables as well as of @xmath60 and @xmath66 . generalising the procedure of @xcite , we require either @xmath79 or @xmath80 for all diagrams .",
    "gauge invariance is preserved by the cut - off , since @xmath81 depend only upon the external variables of the @xmath82 process .",
    "as the @xmath83 s and @xmath66 are always negative , we require one of the two following conditions :    @xmath84    for @xmath85 small , @xmath86 and @xmath87 can not be small simultaneously .",
    "the crossed diagrams have their main contribution for @xmath88 , and are thus suppressed by a power @xmath89 when the cut - off is imposed .",
    "the box diagrams have a leading contribution for @xmath86 or @xmath87 small , and are not power suppressed by the cut - off .",
    "it may be worth pointing out that the vertical propagators are more off - shell in dvcs than in dis , hence one would expect dvcs to be better described by perturbation theory than dis .      in the diagonal case , we have determined the coupling constant @xmath90 by imposing that there are only two constituents in the pion .",
    "this sum rule constraints @xmath11 as follows  @xcite :    @xmath91    as @xmath92 is a priori a function of @xmath5 , the sum rule imposes that @xmath93 should be a function of @xmath5 .",
    "but at high enough @xmath5 , where the details of the non - perturbative interaction are less and less relevant , @xmath92 reaches its asymptotic shape when the cut - off procedure is applied , and we obtain a constant value for @xmath93 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this asymptotic regime was reached for @xmath5 as small as 2  gev@xmath94 . in the following ,",
    "we shall make use of these previously obtained values , which are functions of the cut - off @xmath95 .",
    "however in the dvcs case , an ambiguity may arise as one of the vertices has an external kinematics similar to a vanishing @xmath5 dis .",
    "this ambiguity is lifted if one notices that the pertinent quantities are not @xmath96 and @xmath97 separately but the factorisation scale , which may be taken as the square of their mean , @xmath5 . thus in dvcs , although @xmath97 vanishes , @xmath5 does not and we shall consider that @xmath93 is constant .",
    "from the imaginary part of the total amplitude , the five structure functions @xmath37 can be obtained by a projection on the corresponding tensors . from now on",
    ", @xmath37 will stand for the imaginary part of these structure functions . in order to display their general features , we plot them in fig .  [",

    "let us notice that for any fixed value of @xmath32 not close to @xmath102 , we recover for @xmath11 and @xmath44 the same behaviour as in the diagonal case .",

    "@xmath10 , @xmath12 depend little on @xmath32 except when this variable is close to @xmath102 .",

    "[ fig : f1_dvcs - tvar ] displays the behaviour of @xmath11 for various values of @xmath85 with and without cut - off . in the presence of size effects ,",
    "the value of @xmath11 gets significantly reduced , especially for small @xmath33 , as @xmath103 increases , whereas that effect is much less noticeable without cut - off .    in the elastic case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lim_diago ] ) , the same suppression at small @xmath33 is observed , especially when the cut - off is applied . in fig .  [",

    "on the other hand , when the cut - off is not applied , we see ( fig .  [",

    "furthermore , we checked that the term @xmath114 in eq .",

    "one may wonder whether these results are typical of our model or more general .",
    "-1 cm    having at hand the five functions @xmath37 s that parametrise the amplitude for @xmath115 , we would like to link them to the off - forward parton distribution functions or to the generalised parton distributions .",
    "for this purpose , we make use of a tensorial expression coming from the twist - three analysis of the process , which singles out the twist - two @xmath116 and the twist - three @xmath117 form factors . following ref .",
