    "the role of calorimeter in modern high energy physics experiments has been identifying particles as well as measuring their energy and momentum .",
    "such experiments , the calorimeters have provided the key information on the measured energy and momentum of particles identified as the electromagnetic particles and hadrons by itself , and have become the heart of particle physics experiments . from this fact",
    ", we can infer that the measurement of particle energy with excellent calorimeter energy resolution ends up with high quality particle physics experiments and good physics results .",
    "after the higgs discovery , it is believed that a future lepton collider will focus on understanding the higgs mechanism , and study of the higgs boson properties . to accomplish this , we will need a dedicated higgs factory with excellent detectors which can measure the energy of jets from hadronic decays of w s and z s in the same precision as the energy measurement of electrons and gammas .",
    "+ however , while the detection of electrons , photons and other particles that develop electromagnetic showers can be performed with high precision , the same is not true for hadrons .",
    "+ this is primarily due to the fact that    1 .",
    "most calorimeters generate a larger signal per unit deposited energy for the electromagnetic shower component ( @xmath1 ) than for the hadronic one ( @xmath2 ) ; that is @xmath3 2 .",
    "the fluctuations in the energy sharing between these two components are large and non - poissonian .    as a result ,",
    "in typical instruments the hadronic response function is non - gaussian , the hadronic signals are non - linear .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem :    compensating  calorimeters : :    are designed to deliver equal response to the @xmath4 and    non-@xmath4 shower components : @xmath5 .",
    "this can    be achieved by boosting the response to the hadronic component , for    instance in calorimeters with a hydrogenous active medium that is very    sensitive to the soft neutrons abundantly produced in hadronic shower    development .",
    "such calorimeters require a precisely tuned sampling    fraction .",
    "since this sampling fraction is typically small ( 2.3% in    lead / plastic - scintillator calorimeters ) , the em energy resolution of    such devices is in practice limited to    @xmath6@xcite .",
    "off - line  compensation : :    is a technique applied in devices with @xmath7 , in which    signals from different sections of the calorimeter are re - weighted    according to some scheme to reconstruct the shower true energy .",
    "this    is one of the most common approach , however , it requires attention to    avoid introducing non linearities in the response .",
    "energy  flow : :    combines the calorimeter information with measurements from a tracking    system , to improve the performance for jets .",
    "this method , usually    deployed in combination with the previous one , has been successfully    applied in several modern collider experiments .",
    "particle  flow : :    extends the previous technique by trying to reconstruct each    individual particle in a jet using highly segmented calorimeters and    sophisticated reconstruction algorithms .",
    "dual  readout  method : :    that is the topic of this paper and will be fully described in the    next section .",
    "since the resolution is determined by fluctuations in the electromagnetic fraction of the shower ( @xmath8 ) , measurement of the @xmath8 value , event by event , is the key to improving the hadronic energy resolution of an intrinsically non - compensating calorimeter . in our method , @xmath8 is measured by comparing the shower signals produced in the form of scintillation light ( @xmath9 ) and cherenkov light ( @xmath10 ) in the same detector .    in dual - readout calorimetry",
    "each hadronic shower is measured in two nearly independent ways .",
    "while the scintillation channel is sensitive to both components of the shower , the signals from the hadronic fraction are strongly dominated by spallation hadrons produced in nuclear reactions , these are usually not sufficiently relativistic to produce cherenkov light .",
    "the cherenkov channel is , for all practical purposes , only sensitive to the em shower component ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this can be realized in different ways :    * in a fiber calorimeters , scintillating fibers and clear fibers can used to measure the s and c channel separately . * in a crystal calorimeter , both scintillation and cherenkov light are generated in the same optical volume , and the necessary separation of the two kinds of light is accomplished using time structure , direction , wavelength spectrum , and polarization .",
    "the @xmath1 part is calibrated to unit response , and the resulting average response of the @xmath2 part is denoted by @xmath12 , which is less then unity for most calorimeters",
    ". if @xmath13 is the hadronic energy ( either single hadron or jet ) , and the responses expected in the two channels are @xmath14\\ ] ] @xmath15\\ ] ]    these equations can be inverted to measure both @xmath13 and @xmath8 event - by - event .    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the corrected energy which is a function of the scintillation and cherenkov signals , and the factor @xmath18 , which , in turn , is determined by the physical characteristic of the calorimeter .",

    "the time structure information of the signals was used to determine their scintillation and cherenkov components , integrating , event by event , the pulse shape in two different gates , as it can be seen in fig [ time_gates ] .",
    "the cherenkov signal is defined to be the result of the integral of the pulse in the first gate , while the scintillation signal is defined by the integral on the second and more delayed gate .",
    "these integrated charges were then converted into deposited energy using appropriate calibration constants ( see later for more details ) .     equipped with two optical filters ( a ) and of a bgo crystal equipped with an ug11 filter ( b ) .in order to measure the relative contributions of scintillation and cherenkov light , the time spectrum is integrated in two different gates .",
    "[ time_gates],scaledwidth=75.0% ]    using the time structure of the signal has the advantage that the c and s components are extracted by the same readout channel , while for the optical filter case two different channels , equipped with different filters are needed .",
    "however , as it can be seen from fig [ time_gates ] , not always the use of time structure from only one readout channel is easy .",
    "the result will depend from how much scintillation light is passing from the optical filter bandwidth and from how far in time is the scintillation component from the prompt cherenkov one . in the case of bgo crystal ( fig [ time_gates ]",
    "b ) , because of a longer scintillation decay time , one can see that the definition of two well separated time gates is more easy than in the other case .",
    "a much higher scintillation light yield is also helpful in the bgo case because the signal filtered by the uv filter is much more `` contaminated '' by scintillation photoelectrons , that give the characteristic long tail to the time distribution .",
    "another type of crystal that has also been studied for dual readout applications @xcite was the bismuth silicate ( bso ) , which has the same crystal structure as bgo ( bi@xmath0si@xmath46o@xmath47 ) , with silicon atoms replacing the germanium ones .    we have performed a systematic comparison of the bgo and bso crystals relevant properties and we found that the bso crystal could be very promising if one would like to invest more studies in the optimization of crystals for dual readout calorimetry .",
    "first the purity of the cherenkov signals that can be obtained with uv filters was studied .",
    "we found the contamination of scintillation light in the cherenkov signals to be smaller by about a factor of two in the bso crystal .",
    "then we studied the number of cherenkov photoelectrons detected per unit of deposited energy ; we measured this yield to be about a factor two to three larger for the bso crystal .",
    "the light attenuation length of cherenkov light has been found to be approximately the same as the bgo .",
    "the cheaper price of bso with respect of bgo could also be an advantage . in fig [ xtals ] da comparison between the emission spectrum of bgo ( @xmath44 300 ns ) and the bso ( @xmath44 100 ns ) it shown . the slightly faster signal of bso could be an advantage for high energy applicatons , the time scale of hundred of nanoseconds is still ideal for using informations coming only from one readout channel and , as in the case of bgo , using the integral of pulse shape in two well defined time windows .",
    "the application of the dual readout technique to an hybrid system made by a crystal matrix ( bgo or mo - doped pbwo@xmath0 ) as electromagnetic section and the original dream fiber calorimeter as the hadronic one was evaluated @xcite .",
    "thanks to the experience gained with previous single crystal studies on the way to separate the cherenkov from the scintillation light components , we have also applied to the crystal matrices the same methods : the optical filters and time structure to select the desired type of light .",
    "the bgo matrix was made by 100 bgo crystals , 24 cm long , from a projective segment of the l3 experiment .",
    "the segment was placed perpendicular to the beamline ( 25 x@xmath56 deep ) , as shown in fig [ bgo_dream ] b , in front of the dream calorimeter the readout was made in different ways , the most promising results were obtained with 16 square pmts ( photonis xp3392b ) arranged in a way such that each pmt collected light produced by clusters of at least 9 adjacent crystals .",
    "each pmt was equipped with an ug11 optical filter .    the pbwo@xmath0 matrix ( fig [ bgo_dream ] a ) consisted of seven custom made 0.3 % mo - doped crystals , 20 cm long , arranged in a matrix and placed in the beam line with the beam entering in the central crystal ( 22.5 x@xmath56 longitudinal dimensions ) .",
    "each crystal was equipped with one pmt on each side ( hamamatsu r8900 - 100 ) ; both faces of the matrix were covered with a large optical transmission filter .",
    "several filter combinations were used during our tests .",
    "a calibration procedure was done for both matrices using electron beams .      for the pbwo@xmath0 one",
    "a narrow beam was steered into the center of each of the seven crystals constituting the matrix . according to geant4-based monte",
    "carlo simulations 93% of the energy was deposited in the entire matrix .",
    "after the signals from the crystal were disentangled into cherenkov and scintillation components , the integrated charge in each of these components was determined , equalization constants were found and applied before summing he contribution of each crystal to get the total inter - gate charge .",
    "the average value of that total charge for beam particles traversing the center of the matrix was equated to 93% of the beam energy , and this yielded the conversion factor between the normalized integrated charge and the deposited energy .    in the case of the bgo matrix ,",
    "calibration constants had to be assigned to each of the four pmts that read out the four longitudinal segments of the matrix into which the showers developed .",
    "this calibration procedure was carried out in two steps : first , the gains of all 16 pmts were equalized , by means of an led signal with an amplitude comparable to that of a typical electron shower signal . in the second step , 100 gev electrons were sent into each of the four columns and the hv values of the four pmts in the hit column were varied , in an iterative procedure , until the energy resolution for the summed signals reached a minimum value . because of the size of the bgo matrix , size leakage was considered negligible , and we assumed that the integrated charge collected by the 16 pmts was a good measure of the deposited energy . on that basis , the integrated charge measured in each individual pmt contributing to the signal could be converted into gev as well .",
    "matrix equipped with u330 filters on both sides ( a and b ) ; s , c and @xmath57 signals in case of bgo matrix equipped with ug11 filters ( c ) .",
    "the signals measured at both ends are both shown separately ( a ) and added together ( b ) . [ lin ] @xcite , scaledwidth=75.0% ]      we have investigated the linearity of the observed signals in both crystal matrices and results are shown in fig [ lin ] . in the case of bgo the calorimeter is linear within a 3% for both the c and s components ( fig [ lin ] c ) . in the case of cherenkov signal in pbwo@xmath0 , the linearity is restored only if the signal extracted from the pmts placed on both sides of the crystals are summed ( fig [ lin ] b ) .",
    "this effect is the result of the strong attenuation of the uv light in these kind of crystals , hence as the energy increases , the shower maximum is closer to the downstream pmt and its response is higher , vice versa for the downstream one , as can be seen in fig [ lin ] a. in order to obtain a linear cherenkov response we have equipped both sides of the matrix with a low pass wavelength filter ( u330 ) .",
    "the main disadvantage of this readout geometry is that the u330 filters transmit almost no scintillation light , as can be seen from fig [ time_gates ] a. in an alternative setup , we therefore replaced the downstream u330 filter by a ug5 one , which also transmits light with wavelengths in the region around 500 nm , where scintillation dominates .",
    "this led to a usable scintillation signal .     in a and b figures and bgo in c.a ) :",

    "c : results for the total charge collected by the pmts ( @xmath57 ) and for cherenkov ( c ) and scintillation ( s ) components of the signal .",
    "results from the fit of experimental points are also shown .",
    "[ eresoxtals ] @xcite , scaledwidth=95.0% ]      the energy resolution obtained for the cherenkov channel is shown as a function of the electron energy in fig .",
    "[ eresoxtals ] a for these two sets of experimental data .",
    "the stochastic fluctuations that dominate the measured energy resolutions were found to contribute 20%/@xmath58 and 28%/@xmath58 for these two filter configurations .",
    "no evidence was found for an energy independent contribution to the energy resolution .",
    "the resolutions measured at the low - energy end of each data set deviate from the straight lines .",
    "these deviations are consistent with the contribution of the signal baseline fluctuations to the measured energy resolution .",
    "the energy resolution is strongly dominated by fluctuations in the cherenkov light yeald , this can be seen by the fact that the cherenkov energy resolution improves if ug5 filter , that transmit a larger fraction of cherenkov light , is used .",
    "even though the ug5 filter led to usable scintillation signals , the energy resolution for electron showers measured in the scintillation channel ( as an integral of the tail of the signal ) was somewhat worse than in the cherenkov channel , and about a factor of two worse compared to resolutions measured with the yellow ( gg495 ) filter ( fig [ eresoxtals ] b ) .",
    "this is of course due to the very small fraction of the scintillation light that was detected in this setup . from the sloped of the lines",
    "drown in fig [ eresoxtals ] a the cherenkov light yield was estimated to be 25 photoelectrons per gev in case of ug5 filter and 13 for the u330 .    in case of bgo matrix",
    "the energy resolution measured with electrons in the range 10 - 150 gev is shown in fig [ eresoxtals ] c : @xmath59    the resolution obtained for the scintillation component , as well as that for the total collected charge ( @xmath57 ) i.e. the integral over the entire waveform , are well described by @xmath60 scaling , while the energy resolution measured for the cherenkov component exhibits a deviation , with a constant term b @xmath44 1.5% .",
    "the resolution for this component is affected by significant non - poissonian fluctuations .",
    "this could be due to the fact that in order to use crystals for dual readout calorimetry , we had to apply cuts in the wavelength and in the amount of emitted light ; in particular for the c component we selected a very small fraction of of the total light produced in the crystals , in a wavelength range in which that light is strongly attenuated .    in the case of the bgo matrix",
    "we have also studied the performance of the whole calorimeter with pion beams @xcite .",
    "the information collected with the two sections are combined to obtain an overall evaluation of the electromagnetic fraction of the shower . in order to perform such a measurement we selected only those events",
    "in which pions start showering in the crystal section .",
    "matrix ( a ) and of the hybrid bgo matrix and fiber dream calorimeter ( b ) .",
    "cherenkov signal distribution for 200gev jet events detected in the bgo plus fiber calorimeter system ( c ) , distributions for subsets of events selected on the basis of the ratio of the total cherenkov and scintillation signals ( d ) .",
    "[ bgo_dream ] , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in fig [ bgo_dream ] c the distribution of the total cherenkov signal of the hybrid system bgo + dream fiber calorimeter is shown .",
    "this signal is broad , asymmetric and centered around a value of only 110 gev , whereas the total jet energy was 200 gev . in fig [ bgo_dream ]",
    "d three different subsets of events , selected on the basis of the measured c / s signal ratio are shown .",
    "these three distributions are narrower , well described by gaussian fits and centered at a value that increases roughly proportionally with the c / s value of the selected event sample .",
    "this is precisely what was observed for the fiber calorimeter in stand - alone mode , and what allowed to eliminate the effects of fluctuations in the electromagnetic shower component in that calorimeter .      in conclusion to our r&d on crystals for dual readout calorimetry",
    ", we can say that our interest in studying high - z scintillating crystals for the purpose of dual - readout calorimetry derived from the potential reduction of the contribution of stochastic fluctuations to the energy resolution of such calorimeters .",
    "our goal in further developing this experimental technique is to reduce the contribution of stochastic fluctuations to the point where these are comparable to the irreducible effects of fluctuations in visible energy .",
    "crystals were believed to offer good opportunities in this respect . however , as the results of this study show , things are not so easy .    for the application of crystals to the dual readout method",
    ", the detection of cherenkov light is the crucial issue and particular care was taken in the precision with which the calorimeter performance can be measured using this signal component .",
    "extracting sufficiently pure cherenkov signals from these scintillating crystals with the use of optical filters implies a rather severe restriction to short wavelengths . as a consequence",
    ", a large fraction of the potentially available cherenkov photons needs to be sacrificed , but also , the light that does contribute to the cherenkov signals is strongly attenuated , because of the absorption characteristics of the crystals . as a result ,",
    "the remaining light yield is such that fluctuations in the detected numbers of photoelectrons become a significant contribution to the em energy resolution .",
    "this is an important difference with experiments in which the unfiltered light of such crystals is used for the electromagnetic calorimeter signals .",
    "the conclusion reached after after a long and in - depth study of crystal performances for dual readout calorimetry is that no such significant improvements in term of cherenkov light yield seem to be offered by crystals in combination with filters in dual - readout calorimeters .",
    "the rd52 collaboration decided therefore to focus on the fiber option .",
    "we have proved that the dual - readout method calorimeter could achieve the high - quality energy measurement for both electromagnetic particles and hadrons .",
    "even , geant4 simulation anticipates that the dual - readout calorimeter can have @xmath34 for the stochastic term and very small constant term .",
    "this performance will satisfy the important requirement of the future lepton collider , which is the separation of hadronically decaying w / z bosons .",
    "the rd52 collaboration is make effort to build a large size of calorimeter with cu and will try to prove that it would achieve the excellent energy measurement of hadrons and jets in the future .",
    "the more excellent detector performance , the better physics results we have .",
    "we expect that the dual - readout method calorimeter will be able to achieve the high - precision energy measurement for all fundamental particles and open a new era of experimental particle physics , just as the high purity germanium crystal detector achieved the excellent energy resolution in the nuclear spectroscopy and showed very detail energy levels of nuclei .",
