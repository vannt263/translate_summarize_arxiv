    "vesicles are closed membranes , which are suspended in an aqueous solution .",
    "they represent an attractive biomimetic system , which has revealed several interesting static and dynamical features that bear a strong resemblance with some behavior of real cells . among these features",
    "we can cite equilibrium shapes @xcite revealing forms similar to red blood cells , and tumbling known for these cells @xcite .",
    "it is known that red cells , like vesicles @xcite , orient themselves at a given angle with respect to the shear flow at high hematocrit ( high enough concentration of red cells ) , while at low hematocrit ( where cells behave as being individual ) both in vitro and in vivo observations reveal a tumbling motion , where the long axis of the red cell rotates in a periodic fashion .",
    "it has been recognized for a long time that the viscosity ratio between the internal fluid and the ambient one is a decisive factor ( the more viscous is the internal fluid in comparison to the external one , the easiest is the tumbling ) .",
    "another relevant ingredient is the swelling ratio : a flatten out cell would tumble more easily than a swollen one . several attempts in understanding the tumbling transition have been made in the litterature , the most prominent one is the work of keller and skalak @xcite .",
    "this work uses the solution of the hydrodynamical equations in the stokes regime ( inertial effects are negligibly small for biological blood transport ) around an ellipsoid which involve quite complex expressions .",
    "but still several assumptions had to be made in order to solve the problem .",
    "recently , a full numerical analysis has been presented @xcite and provided the boundaries in the parameter space ( basically the viscosity contrast , and the swelling ratio ) separating the regions of tumbling and those of tank - treading . that work focused on vesicles that correspond to a simplified model of red blood cells , and especially ignored the elastic properties of the membrane , a fact which though turns out to lead to some interesting qualitative changes , will not be accounted for here either .",
    "due to the interplay of several effects in the tumbling transition , it is highly desirable to have at our disposal an analytical theory , which , on the one hand , should reproduce the basic essential features of the tumbling transition , and on the other , should be simple enough in order to shed light on the various competing phenomena leading to tumbling .",
    "it is the main aim of the present paper to deal with this question .",
    "the present theory bypasses the tedious computation of the velocity field around the ellipsoid ( note that in the general case , no analytical solution of the stokes flow is known ) , and is based on the assumption that the forces acting on each piece of the vesicle membrane are proportional to the actual relative velocity at the membrane with respect to the applied flow .",
    "it follows from our study that simple enough notions account remarkably well for many features and render each effect transparent .",
    "in addition , this work offers a promising basis for more elaborate models , including , for example , the effect of membrane stretching or shear elasticity .",
    "the scheme of this paper is as follows . in section [ ingredient ]",
    ", we present the basic ingredients of the model .",
    "section [ moment ] is devoted to the derivation of the dynamical equation that governs the motion of the vesicle .",
    "this part is based on a torque balance .",
    "section [ vtank ] presents a complementary ingredient that serves to put the evolution equation in a closed form .",
    "this is based on an energy balance between the inner fluid of the vesicle and the work provided by the ambient one .",
    "the main outcomes of the analytical theory together with their confrontation with the full numerical analysis are presented in section [ outcome ] .",
    "* as in @xcite , we will assume the shape of the vesicle to be an undeformable ellipse , with the long and the short axes denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "it will be recognized that the theory can be used for arbitrary prescribed shapes . for definitness11",
    "we shall , however , specialize our discussion to an elliptical shape .",
    "the enclosed area is denoted by @xmath3 , and the perimeter by @xmath4 .",
    "the fluid embedded into the vesicle has a viscosity @xmath5 and the ambient one @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the swelling ratio of the vesicle defined in @xmath8 as @xmath9 . for a circle @xmath10 and it is smaller than one otherwise . *",
    "the vesicle is subjected to a linear shear flow @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the shear rate .",
    "since the vesicles of interest have a fluid membrane , each material point on the membrane will be transported by the flow , so that the membrane moves in a tank - tread fashion .",
    "+ let us make a remark , which will prove to be useful later in this paper .",
    "a simple shear flow characterized by the ( 2@xmath132 ) shear rate matrix + @xmath14 + can be decomposed into two parts : a symmetric one given by @xmath15 + and an antisymmetric one given by + @xmath16 + as shown on fig .",
    "[ dshear ] , the antisymmetric part provides a rigid - like clockwise rotation of the vesicle ( r ) , while the symmetric part corresponds to an elongational ( or strain ) flow , which tends to orient the vesicle along @xmath17 ( e ) .",
    "+ our calculation is based on the following two properties of the stokes equations : * due to the linearity of the stokes equations , the superposition principle for given boundary conditions applies : the velocity field around a vesicle subjected to a tank - treading and a tumbling motion in a simple shear flow is the sum of the velocity fields obtained for the three following configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ figflow ] ) : * * a simple shear flow acting on a rigid body fixed in the flow at a constant orientation angle @xmath18 with a fluid velocity equal to zero on the contour of the vesicle . * * the flow created by a rigid elliptic body rotating at a rotation velocity @xmath19 in a quiescent fluid . * * the flow created by an elliptic body subjected to a tank - treading motion of its contour and fixed at a constant orientation @xmath18 in a quiescent fluid . *",
    "the second ingredient , which follows from the previous one , is an extension of a general result valid in stokes flows for a solid which is in relative motion at a velocity @xmath20 with respect to the surrounding fluid .",
    "the drag force on the solid scales as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is ( a drag coefficient ) function of the geometry of the body . in a translational motion at speed @xmath23 , in a quiescent newtonian fluid of viscosity @xmath24 , scales indeed as @xmath25 more formally , we can write a linear relation between the force and the velocity : @xmath26 @xmath27 is a tensor which is symmetrical for a newtonian fluid , and in a specific frame linked to the solid , one can write : @xmath28 ] there is a linear relation between the force and the relative velocity of the body with respect to the applied flow .",
    "we view the elliptic contour as being represented by adjacent segments .",
    "the key hypothesis of the following analysis is to apply this property , ie .",
    "the linearity between forces and relative velocities , on each segment of the membrane .",
    "let us make some important comments about the meaning of this assumption .",
    "the external force applied on an elementary segment of the membrane is provided , on the one hand , by the flow imposed externally , and , on the other hand , by the back - flow due to the presence of the vesicle .",
    "this retroaction of the vesicle on the applied flow is a complex piece of the study and an exact determination of its effect requires sophisticated numerical treatments such as the boundary integral method ( @xcite ) . in our model ,",
    "the basic assumption stated above takes into account this complex interaction in an effective manner : the effect of the back - flow is included in the coefficient @xmath22 , which links the effective force to the relative velocity of the segment with respect to the applied flow . in the framework of our model",
    ", this coefficient is chosen to be independant on the particular elementary segment considered .",
    "this is reminiscent of a ",
    "mean - field  like approximation .",
    "this coefficient is also a priori non isotropic , _",
    "i.e. _ takes different values depending on wether we consider the normal direction or the transverse direction of the elementary segment considered .",
    "these two values will be denoted as @xmath29 and @xmath30 and their determination will be discussed in section [ outcome ] .",
    "to some extent this model is akin to the rouse model for polymer rods @xcite , where hydrodynamical interactions between adjacent pieces are ignored .",
    "as stated above , the main idea is to use the linear generalized stokes law at the local level of each segment of the contour , and to compute the torque associated with the force .",
    "since we shall decompose the velocity field into an applied shear , a tank - treading motion , and a tumbling one , we shall have to deal with three types of forces separately .",
    "once each torque is evaluated , we sum up the three contributions , and set the resultant to be zero , owing to absence of inertia . once the expressions of the forces are specified , the remaining pieces of the work are purely algebraic with some specific integrals involving the geometry of the vesicle .    since the stokes law relating the force to the relative velocity is local , we find it convenient to first , write it in the frame linked to the vesicle , and then , to express the torque elements in the laboratory frame for ease of computations .",
    "we refer to fig .",
    "[ axis ] for the different frames used here .",
    "the laboratory frame has the basis denoted as @xmath31 .",
    "the rotating frame , which is linked to the principal axes of the ellipse , is specified by its basis denoted @xmath32 . the local frame associated to an elementary segment on the elliptic contour",
    "is specified by @xmath33 .    in the local frame @xmath33",
    ", the components of the local force ( or drag ) applied on the segment per unit length in the transverse direction can be expressed as functions of the relative velocities @xmath34 exerted upon a membrane element :    @xmath35    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are phenomenological parameters of the model associated respectively to the transverse and the normal motions to the segment @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 have positive values with the choice of eqs .",
    "[ lforces ] .",
    "they have a dimension of the inverse of a length .",
    "the crux of the analysis is to decompose the local velocity in three pieces as stated above , and evaluate various torques .    * _ ( 1 ) : torque of the force acting on the body in a simple shear flow _ + in the laboratory frame @xmath31 , the velocity field of a simple shear flow takes the form : + @xmath37 @xmath12 is the shear rate , which fixes the time - scale of the flow . written in the local coordinate system @xmath33 , the relative velocity reads : + @xmath38 + using ( [ lforces ] ) , we determine the associated forces denoted as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , from which the torque is computed as : + @xmath41 + using the coordinates linked with the natural axes of the ellipse ( for a convenient calculation ) , we easily find : + @xmath42 \\label{shear}\\ ] ] + with the convention that a positive torque corresponds to a clockwise rotation ( see fig .",

    "@xmath63    @xmath64 is the contribution of the tank - treading motion of the membrane to the effective angular velocity @xmath19 of the vesicle .",
    "@xmath65    @xmath66 is the effective elongational velocity which represents the main contribution of the elongational flow and tends to orient the vesicle along a direction making an angle @xmath67 with respect to the applied flow .",

    "inspection of eqs ( [ dpsi2])-([elong ] ) reveals , in particular , that for a rigid membrane where @xmath71 , no stationnary solution is possible : a rigid elliptic body should always tumble , as one expects .",
    "this can be interpreted by the fact that the rotational velocity @xmath73 is always bigger than the elongational velocity @xmath74 . if allowance is made for a tank - treading motion ( due to the membrane fluidity and the finite viscosity of the internal liquid ) then @xmath75 .",
    "equations ( [ dpsi2 ] ) , ( [ vrot ] ) and ( [ vc ] ) show indeed that the tank - treading motion described by the velocity @xmath64 results in an effective reduction of the global rotation @xmath62 , provided that the tank - treading velocity @xmath76 has a positive value .",
    "a stationary ( non tumbling ) tank - treading motion of the shape is thus possible if the velocity @xmath74 , representing the elongational part of the flow , can balance the effective tumbling velocity @xmath77 .",
    "this can occur for sufficiently high values of the tank - treading velocity .",
    "hitherto , the tank - treading velocity has been introduced as a phenomenological quantity , and it must be computed independently . this step is necessary in order to have an evolution equation in a closed form .",
    "the tank - treading velocity is clearly limited by the viscous friction of the internal fluid , and this piece of information must be evoked in order to complete the analysis .",
    "following @xcite , the tank - treading velocity @xmath76 can be determined by considering the energy dissipated in the system .",
    "the energy injected by the flow is dissipated by viscous friction in the fluid inside the vesicle .",

    "this implies that both coefficients @xmath107 and @xmath108 vanish , and so does the total power .",
    "this result is conforting since inside a sphere the fluid executes a rigid - like rotation ( there is no dissipation ) and thus no energy can be transferred .",
    "it is only when the shape deviates from a circle ( or a sphere in 3d ) that dissipation is permissible .",
    "note that we arrived at this result before using any information about dissipation in the enclosed fluid , and this points to a consistency of the model .",
    "the energy dissipated by viscous friction in the volume of the vesicle is of the form :    @xmath109    in general , we have to determine the velocity field , which satifies the stokes equations inside the vesicle and subjected to boundary conditions at the surface of the ellipse .",
    "our aim is not to determine the velocity field exactly , which is not an easy task in general ( and an exact result is the exception rather than the rule ) .",
    "rather we wish to capture the main ingredients and remain within a heuristic analysis . for that purpose",
    ", it will be sufficient to make use of an approximate solution inferred from simple considerations based on the result relative to a spherical shape . in order to anticipate the main ingredient",
    ", we shall take the case of a slightly deformed circle as a reference in order to serve as a guide for our reasoning .",
    "consider @xmath110 to be small .",
    "the following velocity field fulfills the prescribed conditions ( _ i.e. _ to be a solution of the stokes equations in the inner domain of the vesicle ) : @xmath111 it must be noted that despite the fact that the velocity is not exactly constant along the contour , the velocity remains colinear to the tangent at the membrane ] this flow ensures a constant value for the tank - treading velocity along the contour but the velocity is not colinear to the tangential direction of the contour . ] and this continues to represent a reasonable approximation .",
    "let us estimate the energy dissipated in the vesicle .",
    "this is given by :    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is a constant depending on @xmath1 and @xmath2 : @xmath114 in the present case .",
    "using ( [ etot ] ) and ( [ eps ] ) , we arrive at :    @xmath115    where    @xmath116    @xmath117    @xmath118    as could be anticipated , the tank - treading velocity is directly proportional to @xmath12 which fixes the time - scale of the imposed flow .",
    "we also note that the tank - treading velocity enjoys the same symmetry as the elongational flow does : it vanishes for @xmath119 and is maximal for @xmath120 .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "as explained in section [ moment ] , a shear flow can always be split into a rotational part and an elongational one ( see fig .",
    "[ dshear ] ) . in order to understand the origin of the tank - treading motion ,",
    "it is appropriate to specify the role of both the elongational and the rotational components of the flow .    on the one hand , for a purely rotational flow , eq .",
    "( [ etot ] ) shows that @xmath121 since @xmath122 .",
    "equating ( [ etot ] ) and ( [ eps ] ) leads to the condition @xmath71 , provided that the shape is not circular .",
    "this corresponds to a global solid - like rotation . on the other hand , for a purely elongational flow , eqs .",
    "( [ etot ] ) and ( [ eps ] ) lead to @xmath123 .",
    "a non - zero tank - treading velocity is possible with the proviso that the orientation angle is different from @xmath67 ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "the torque applied on the vesicle arising from the elongational flow is ( see eq.[melong ] ) @xmath125 .",
    "an inspection of the balance of the torques for the elongational flow , as done in section [ moment ] , leads to the dynamical equation @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath67 is thus , the only steady equilibrium position , with a tank - treading velocity equal to zero .",
    "hence , the existence of a tank - treading motion of the membrane is only a consequence of the coupling between the rotational and the elongational part of the flow .",
    "the total effect of the shear can be interpreted as follows : the rotational part tends to push the orientation angle of the vesicle axis towards lower values than @xmath67 .",
    "as soon as this is achieved the vesicle acquires a non - zero tank - treading velocity since there , the elongational part enters into action ( see eq.([elong ] ) )",
    "plugging eq .",
    "( [ evtank ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dpsi2 ] ) , we can express explicitly @xmath127 ( which involves the tank - treading motion of the vesicle ) and this leads to the general dynamical equation for the orientation angle @xmath18 of the vesicle :    @xmath128    where    @xmath129    @xmath130\\ ] ]    a purely tank - treading motion corresponds to the situation where the inclination angle is constant .",
    "this is expressed by @xmath131 which implies the condition:@xmath132 .",
    "this constraint leads , in particular , to a condition on the viscosity ratio between the inner and the outer fluid :    @xmath133 \\label{tumbling_cond}\\ ] ]    this is the general condition which can be tabulated numerically , provided that the two drag coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are known , which is exactly the case for several shapes ( disks , ellipses , spheres ) .",
    "thus , the condition relates uniquely the viscosity contrast to geometrical quantities which are functions of the swelling ratio . in order to gain more insight towards an analytical progress we can explore the situation of a small deformation around the spherical shape",
    "this proves to be sufficient to capture the essential features . for that purpose ,",
    "we set @xmath134 and treat @xmath135 as a small parameter .",
    "the integrals @xmath136 that enter in ( [ tumbling_cond ] ) can be evaluated explicitly , so that the critical condition for tumbling is expressed in a simple form in terms of the viscosity ratio and the swelling ratio @xmath7 :    @xmath137    and the dissipation rate ( [ eps ] ) scales as : @xmath138    this law for the dissipation rate is in a good agreement with previous numerical results ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we find here that the closer is the shape to a sphere , the more difficult does tumbling occur ; the viscosity contrast for tumbling diverges as @xmath139 .",
    "we have seen that the model presented here captures the essential features and sheds light on the various competing effects that fix the tank - treading and tumbling motions .",
    "we may ask the question whether the model can be made more quantitative . as stated before",
    ", the model requires the introduction of two drag parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 which are the proportionality constants relating the force and velocity in the normal and the tangential directions .",
    "let us recall that these two drag coefficients describe the effect of the hydrodynamic interaction felt by a membrane element .",
    "this involves the geometry of the shape around a given element of membrane and these drag parameters are a priori function of the position of the element considered on the contour .",
    "if one wishes to go beyond a qualitative discussion we must determine these two drag parameters , which can be made in general only numerically . for a sphere with a radius @xmath1 moving in a stokes flow , it is known that on a local segment of the spherical contour we have : @xmath140 ( see @xcite ) . instead of evaluating the exact values of these parameters for each elementary elements of the membrane , we shall rather estimate them from the best fit with the full numerical simulations obtained previously(@xcite ) .",
    "note that each membrane portion can be approximated locally as an arc of a circle .",
    "thus , as in the case of a sphere we chose equal values for the drag coefficients in the normal and in the transverse directions with respect to the contour : @xmath141 .",
    "we consider now a vesicle with an aspect ratio @xmath142 and determine several quantities .",
    "the results have been confronted to the full numerical computation and the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been guessed . for various tests made so far , we found that @xmath143 per unit length in the transverse direction provide the most reasonable fit .",
    "we present on fig .",
    "[ tetar ] the evolution of the equilibrium angle as a function of the viscosity ratio @xmath49 , which corresponds to the stable branch of the saddle - node bifurcation @xcite .",
    "the prediction of the model qualitatively reproduces the bifurcation branch ( this is always the case regardless of the chosen parameter ) , and is fairly in reasonable agreement on the quantitative level .",
    "the point at which the angle is zero corresponds to the threshold of the tumbling bifurcation .",
    "this threshold depends on the swelling ratio . consequently , the two parameters controlling the bifurcation are the viscosity contrast and the swelling ratio . fig . [ rctau ] represents the boundary between the region of the phase diagram where pure tank - treading motion takes place ( low @xmath49 and high @xmath7 ) and that , where the motion is of tumbling type ( which is favored at large @xmath49 and small @xmath7 ) . the results are compared with the full numerical calculation .",
    "it is also worthwhile to represent some other physical quantities .",
    "of particular interest are the global rotation velocity and the tank - treading velocity ( figs .",
    "[ vrottau],[vtanktau ] and [ vrotvisc],[vtankvisc ] ) .    before concluding some additional comments are worth to mention . following the considerations in section [ vtank ] ,",
    "the tank - treading motion is a result of the competition between the rotational part of the flow and the elongational component .",
    "more precisely , the rotational component pushes the vesicle axis away from the elongational main axis ( @xmath144 ) , allowing the membrane to acquire a non - zero tank - treading motion .",
    "one may say that part of the rotation torque is transferred to the tank - treading one . increasing the viscosity of the inner fluid results in a global reduction of the tank - treading velocity since the internal dissipation penalizes velocity gradients inside the vesicle ( see fig .",
    "[ vtankvisc ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ vrotvisc ] the effective tumbling velocity should thus increase , reducing further the value of @xmath18 .",
    "however , thanks to the @xmath145 variation of the tank - treading velocity , a new equilibrium position can be found at a value of @xmath18 which is a decreasing function of the viscosity ratio . in the extreme limit where @xmath146 , the elongational velocity @xmath66 reaches its maximum and can not overcome the rotational velocity on further increase of the internal viscosity : the steady - state solution does nt exist anymore whereby a new dynamical solution takes place in the form of tumbling .",
    "[ tetar ] illustrates the evolution of the equilibrium angle as a function of the viscosity ratio .",
    "the above discussion was made on the assumption that the swelling ratio is constant .",
    "the swelling ratio is a measure of the deviation from a spherical shape .",
    "for the particular case of a circular shape ( corresponding to a swelling ratio @xmath10 ) , the total velocity arising from the rotational part of the flow is completely transferred in the tank - treading motion of the membrane so that the effective tumbling velocity @xmath147 ( in reality , as commented above , this situation is degenerate and there is no distinction between rigid rotation and tank - treading ) . for a circular shape ,",
    "the tank - treading velocity is maximal and equal to @xmath148 where @xmath1 is the radius of the circle .",
    "this result has already been obtained directly in section [ moment ] .",
    "figures [ vrottau ] and [ vtanktau ] represent the evolution of the tank - treading velocity and the effective tumbling velocity @xmath149 as a function of the swelling ratio @xmath7 . as the shape deviates from a circular one , the effective velocity responsible for tumbling @xmath150 increases ( fig .",
    "[ vrottau ] ) since the tank - treading velocity decreases ( fig .",
    "[ vtanktau ] ) .",
    "this explains that the transition to a tumbling regime can be achieved for lower values of the viscosity ratio as the swelling ratio decreases .",
    "this is indeed what is observed on fig .",
    "[ rctau ] .",
    "we have presented a simple model bypassing the calculation of the stokes flow .",
    "we have captured the essential features of the transition tank - treading / tumbling , and have a transparent view of the various competing phenomena .",
    "this work has added a piece to our understanding of tumbling .",
    "there are several important effects that have been disregarded , however .",
    "we have restricted most of our discussion to 2d shapes . in view of the result of keller and skalak@xcite",
    "we do not expect a qualitative change when 3d shapes are considered , provided that the shape is prescribed .",
    "if the shape is free to evolve , the shear may induce a shape transformation , like a prolate / oblate transition , and this constitutes an important task for future investigations .",
    "in addition , we did not include the fact that the two monolayers forming the vesicle membrane may slide with respect to each other @xcite . in that case one has to include two tank - treading velocities , one for each layer , and evaluate the membrane internal dissipation .",
    "it will be an interesting point to clarify the influence of this fact on tumbling . for biological cells , like red cells ,",
    "further refinement of the model is clearly necessary .",
    "for example , red blood cells tumble in vivo in the same manner as vesicles do .",
    "there is however a notable difference between vesicles and red cells .",
    "the transition to tumbling depends on the shear rate @xcite .",
    "this dependence is completely absent for vesicles since there is only one time scale @xmath151 which is imposed by the flow .",
    "this points to the fact that there should exist a relevant intrinsic time scale for red cells .",
    "a natural candidate is the elastic ( or even viscoelastic ) response of the cytoskeleton .",
    "a natural time scale is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the ( 2d ) shear modulus of the spectrin network forming the red cell cytoskeleton , and @xmath24 is the membrane viscosity .",
    "available data on @xmath153 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite provide us with @xmath152 of the order of @xmath154 seconds , which is not far from @xmath151 in ordinary experiments @xcite .",
    "we are presently using a simple model for elasticity in order to analyse the qualitative features of this effect @xcite .",
