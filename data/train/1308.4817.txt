    "the question of the mass generation of particles is crucial in modern high energy physics .",
    "the standard model predicts the existence of a scalar boson , the _",
    "particle , which is capable of giving mass to the fundamental particles by the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "now , what about the mass of composite objects like the baryons , most notably the nucleon ?",
    "the sum of the mass of the three quarks that form a nucleon is not equal to the mass of the baryon , but is much smaller ( @xmath4 ) . where does the dominant contribution to the nucleon mass come from?in this work we want to shed some light on this question .",
    "we focus on two mechanisms in which we can introduce the nucleon and its chiral partner , denoted as @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , by testing the consequences in each case .",
    "the field @xmath6 is usually identified with the resonance @xmath7 but @xmath1 is also a viable candidate @xcite .",
    "we study both scenarios in this work.one way to introduce the chiral partner of the nucleon is via the @xmath8 @xmath9 @xcite . in this assignment",
    "the mass of the nucleon ( and that of its chiral partner ) is generated only through spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , since a mass term would not be chirally invariant .",
    "( we neglect here the small contribution of the nonzero bare quark masses . )",
    "the introduction of an explicit mass term , which should occur in a chirally invariant way , is only possible within the @xmath10 @xmath9 .",
    "the mirror assignment was analyzed for the first time in ref .",
    "@xcite and there dismissed as unusable , as it led to the unphysical conclusion that the coupling between nucleons and pions vanishes .",
    "this problem was solved later by introducing all terms allowed by chiral symmetry .",
    "the interest in the mirror assignment has been revitalized by the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , after which it has been investigated in a variety of works studying the phenomenology of baryons in the vacuum and at nonzero density @xcite .",
    "it is still an open question which is the correct assignment in nature . to this end",
    ", both assignments should be investigated and validated by experimental data such as the axial coupling constants , the decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the @xmath13 scattering lengths : this is the aim of the present work .",

    "@xcite we concentrated , in the framework of the so - called extended linear sigma model ( elsm ) , on the mirror assignment only , here we construct for the first time the elsm version also for the naive assignment .",
    "the elsm contains , besides the usual ( pseudo)scalar mesons , also ( axial-)vector degrees of freedom ; their presence changes substantially the properties of baryon phenomenology both in the naive and mirror assignments allowing for a correct description of the axial coupling constants of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , in the naive assignment , the absence of ( axial-)vector states implies a complete decoupling of the fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , thus also implying the ( unphysical ) vanishing of the decay @xmath14 the introduction of ( axial-)vector d.o.f .",
    "implies a residual @xmath15 coupling , thus making also the naive assignment realistic .",
    "however , we shall find that , even in this more complete treatment , the naive assignment is not capable to reproduce the isospin - odd pion - nucleon scattering length .",
    "we thus arrive at the conclusion that the mirror assignment is favoured to be the correct way to incorporate baryons in ( linear ) chiral models .",
    "it should be stressed that our approach is not designed to reach the accuracy that chiral perturbation theory delivers in the description of pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "namely , the latter approach is tailor - made to study the interaction of nucleons with the quasi - goldstone bosons of low - energy qcd , the pions , in a systematic framework , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein . however , our linear chiral approach has the advantage to incorporate from the very beginning massive resonances ( i.e. , the chiral partners ) , and is thus suited to study their decays , as shown in  ref .",

    "2 . note , in  fig .",
    "2 only one curve for @xmath228 is shown in the naive assignment : this is due to the fact that the results for @xmath229 are almost identical for the two partners @xmath0 and @xmath230 the small numerical difference can not be resolved graphically .",
    "a last comment concerns the pion - nucleon sigma term in the naive assignment : it amounts to @xmath231 mev , thus only slightly larger than in the mirror case . a similar discussion to the one in sec .",
    "3.1 holds here .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the nucleon and its chiral partner , identified with either @xmath0 or @xmath1 , within the extended linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "the novel ingredient is that the chiral partner was incorporated in the naive assignment in presence of ( axial-)vector degrees of freedom .",
    "the results were compared to the ones obtained in @xcite , where the chiral partner was coupled in the mirror assignment .",
    "two fundamental differences between the two assignments have played an important role in this work :    * in the naive assignment , the mass generation takes place only through the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry . on the contrary , in the mirror assignment",
    "the mass term @xmath232 is allowed , and the mass of the nucleon is generated by this term _ and _ by the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the quantity @xmath233 is the only term in the baryonic sector of the elsm lagrangian which does not fulfill dilatation invariance . in order to achieve this in a chirally invariant way , which is one of the basic principle toward the construction of the elsm @xcite",
    ", one can modify @xmath234 by including an interaction of the nucleon with a dilaton / glueball field @xmath235 and a tetraquark field @xmath236 ( see refs . @xcite and refs .",
    "therein for a phenomenological discussion ) : @xmath237 the mass term @xmath67 is then generated when shifting these fields by their vacuum expectation values , @xmath238 and @xmath239:@xmath240 + this fact shows an important point : even if the scalar - isoscalar field @xmath47",
    "( i.e. , the chiral partner of the pion ) is identified with the heavy resonance @xmath241 , as current results show @xcite , in the mirror assignment it is possible to write down a _ chirally invariant _ interaction which couples the nucleon to the lightest scalar - isoscalar light meson @xmath149 , which can be identified with a tetraquark field @xmath236 ( or , similarly , to a pion - pion molecular state @xcite : the difference between these two configurations is not important here ) .",
    "moreover , one can couple the nucleon also to the glueball field ( to be identified predominantly with @xmath242 or with @xmath243 ) .",
    "these additional interactions are not possible in the naive assignment without breaking chiral symmetry .",
    "this is a clear theoretical advantage of the mirror assignment w.r.t . the naive assignment .",
    "these properties are also important for the study of the model at non - zero density : in ref . @xcite it has been shown that a light tetraquark field @xmath244 allows for a correct description of nuclear matter saturation and compressibility .",
    "* in the naive assignment the interaction between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is solely given by the derivative coupling to the pion , which in turn is possible only due to the inclusion of the ( axial-)vector mesons in the model . without (",
    "axial-)vector mesons the decay @xmath116 or the formation of a resonance @xmath6 in @xmath245 scattering does not take place . in the mirror assignment",
    "we do not have such restrictions . even without ( axial-)vector mesons",
    "the decay @xmath116 does not vanish since terms of the form @xmath246 are present .    in the mirror assignment ,",
    "the theoretical value of the isospin - odd scattering length @xmath247 is in very well agreement with experimentally measured and the chpt results ( see tables 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this is not the case in the naive assignment ( table 3 ) , in which the theoretical result @xmath247 is clearly too small .",
    "the isospin - even scattering is not yet conclusive ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : one has to go beyond the present treatment by including both resonances @xmath149 and @xmath241 in the study of the scattering lengths , see also refs .",
    "@xcite . the decay into @xmath206 turns out to bee too small for @xmath0 in any assignment , whereas for @xmath1 it agrees with the experimental data , thus favouring the latter as the chiral partner of the nucleon . summarizing , our outcome is the following : the mirror assignment with the resonance @xmath1 as the chiral partner of the nucleon seems to be the favoured situation .",
    "future studies on baryons are necessary to confirm that the mirror assignment is the correct way to incorporate the nucleon and its chiral partner . in the vacuum , an important future work is the description in a unique framework of the four baryonic resonances @xmath248 @xmath249 @xmath7 and @xmath1 @xcite . in this enlarged scenario",
    "it will be possible to test further the mirror and the naive assignments ( and eventually a combination of them ) .",
    "important hints come also from studies at nonzero density @xcite , where it is shown that the mirror assignment is able to describe nuclear matter at nonzero density ; the results do not depend on the mass of the chiral partner ( and thus on the choice of @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , but depend strongly on the value of @xmath67 .",
    "namely , only for @xmath250 mev the nuclear matter compressibility can be correctly described @xcite .",
    "the range @xmath250 mev is compatible with @xmath0 , for which we have @xmath251 mev , but also ( and even better ) with @xmath252 for which @xmath253 mev .",
    "the need of a sizable @xmath67 was also corroborated in the recent study of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the emergence of an inhomogenous chiral condensate was studied : it was shown that a value of @xmath250 mev is necessary to have an homogeneous liquid nuclear matter ground state .    in this paper",
    "we have also evaluated the pion - nucleon sigma term , which turns out to be about @xmath254 mev in the mirror case and about @xmath255 mev in the naive one .",
    "both values are smaller than the results present in the literature .",
    "this is due to the fact that in our approach no explicit symmetry breaking is considered in the baryonic part of the lagrangian(s ) and the pion - nucleon sigma terms arise solely from the explicit breaking present in the chiral condensate .",
    "the result represents anyhow a sizable contribution to the pion - nucleon sigma term .",
    "the missing piece can be included by adding an explicit breaking mass term for the baryons .",
    "this is an important outlook , which is also necessary for a better description of the isospin - even scattering length .    considering that the calculation of scattering lengths and decays was carried at tree - level , an interesting outlook is the inclusion of mesonic loops .",
    "however , many resonances are present in the model , which are exchanged in scattering processes ( as , for instance , the ( axial-)vector mesons ) ; their contribution is automatically taken into account at tree - level without the need of resummations . moreover , the ratio of the decay width to the mass of the @xmath6 resonance ( in both scenarios ) is small , implying that the evaluation of loops , while surely valuable , is not expected to change the qualitative picture that we have presented @xcite .    in future studies",
    "one should also incorporate the @xmath256 resonance @xcite and extend the present model to @xmath257 also in the baryonic sector .",
