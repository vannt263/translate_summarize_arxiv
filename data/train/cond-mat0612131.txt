    "in 1958 , e. wigner predicted that an electron gas in a positive jellium background would , at low density , solidify into an ordered lattice@xcite .",
    "moreover , in classical systems that have been studied in certain soft condensed matter models , the strong coulomb repulsion is sufficient to cause a system of particles to crystallize @xcite .",
    "in such a phase , the most natural physical quantities to consider are the elementary excitations . the charged collective modes or plasmons at @xmath0 are entities of this sort , the essential features of which are captured by a classical description@xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the inclusion of strong disorder either chemically or , in the case of a low dimensional system , via a rough external substrate will result in the destruction of a well - defined base lattice .",
    "that is , the term `` wigner crystal '' is no longer entirely descriptive in the presence of sufficiently strong disorder .",
    "rather , that system is closer to a `` glass '' than a crystalline solid .",
    "formally , the existence of bragg peaks indicates that the system is a solid .",
    "however , others have discussed the possibility that the system retains quasi - long range order as a consequence of disorder@xcite .",
    "subtle implications are entailed by the term `` glass '' in describing a system in terms of its magnetic and topological properties . here , we restrict our definition of `` glass - like '' to a system with a random positional configuration at zero magnetic field , even though a 1d system can not truly be topologically disordered as in higher dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "in this article we focus on two aspects of one dimensional disordered wigner crystal(1dwc ) systems  in particular the plasma oscillations and the statistical behavior of the equilibrium electron locations .",
    "we numerically study the plasma modes of the disordered system and calculate the compressibility and the ac conductivity . regarding the structural properties",
    ", we consider whether the distribution of the spacings between adjacent electrons can be analytically understood in terms of the randomness in other parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "a mathematical formalism is developed that provides some insight into the connection between power spectrum of the randomness and the positional statistics .",
    "we also attempt to address the long - standing issue of whether a classical wigner crystal in the presence of either random field or random charge disorder preserves some degree of crystalline integrity .",
    "let us now consider how disorder can affect the positional ordering of the particles in the 1dwc system . evidently , the nature of disorder in such a system is not unique .",
    "it can exist in the spacings between the particle sites , the masses , the effective interaction between particles , or one can have a set of charges pinned by a random potential .",
    "it is also the case that the introduction of randomness in one parameter can induce randomness in another .",
    "for example , randomness in particle - particle interactions or an external field may well result in the destruction of a periodic base lattice at mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the ordered system of size @xmath1 is defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath2 where the quantities @xmath3 and @xmath4 refer to the momentum and effective mass of the @xmath5 particle , respectively .",
    "our system lives in the low density regime in which the coloumb interactions are much more influential than the kinetic energy , resulting in the crystalline ordering of the particles with the spatial coordinates @xmath6 separated with lattice constant @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the system is stabilized by a positive jellium neutralizing background .",
    "we wish to examine the vibrational modes of the system taking into account the full electrostatic force acting on each charge .",
    "one can add to this hamiltonian a term representing the interaction of the charges with a random electrostatic potential @xmath8 , defined as , @xmath9 where the parameter @xmath10 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "the random variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 have a mean equal to zero . moreover , their distributions are controlled by independent gaussian distributions",
    "the widths of which are independendent of @xmath13 , yielding a `` white noise '' power spectrum",
    ". we will call this system model a.    additionally , we can explicitly inject randomness into the single charge values @xmath14 .",
    "we term this random charge system model b , where the hamiltonian is obtained from ( [ eq : plashamilt ] ) by replacing the @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "some possible realizations of this model may be found in soft condensed matter systems such as in biopolymer arrays that have contain randomly assigned chemical constituents and unscreened coulomb interactions@xcite .    in both model",
    "a and model b , the charges in our lattice will relax to mechanical equilibrium , at locations that differ from the evenly - spaced positions they occupy in the ordered case . here",
    ", we characterize key properties of the equilibrium configuration , focusing on the statistical characteristics of the spacings between neighboring points . finally , we discuss the extent to which the resulting lattice exhibits crystalline order .    as a first step in answering these questions for model b ,",
    "we examine the product density functions for different distributions of charges .",
    "this is shown in appendix [ sec : appa ] .",
    "there is a direct relationship between this distribution and the distribution of forces in the case of strongly - screened interactions .",
    "the general distribution of the forces on a particular charge when interactions are unscreened requires a more involved analysis .",
    "given this probability distribution , we turn to the distribution function of the spacings between the charges at equilibrium .",
    "it turns out that an analytical result that is valid in the weak disorder regime  based on the assumption that the width of the single charge distributions is very small  agrees remarkably well with the results of numerical calculations .",
    "we will call this result the `` viscosity approximation '' in that it is based on the notion that the charges will deviate from the ordered lattice by distances that are proportional to the total force acting on each charge @xmath17 when they are equally spaced .",
    "that is , @xmath18 , as if the system were placed in a highly viscous medium and initial displacements of the charges from their initial positions were predictive of their eventual positions .",
    "given this assumption , one can work out the solution to model b for all three of the distributions noted above starting with the gaussian system .",

    "this derivation in terms of probability convolutions can similarly be extended to the random potential system of model a. we previously defined the random potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpfourier ] ) . to simplify the analysis we will only consider the cosine contributions and will perform the analysis for a gaussian distribution of the random amplitudes .",
    "the resulting fourier decomposition yields the expression , @xmath41 the force on the @xmath5 charge is then given by , @xmath42    it is evident that the source of the randomness is not a coupling constant between particles as was the case in model b. rather , we relate probability density of random fourier amplitudes , @xmath11 ( `` white noise '' ) , to the particle probability density of successive spacings .",
    "the probability convolution for the force is given as :    @xmath43    as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conva ] ) having the same mathematical structure as ( [ eq : econv ] ) , one can carry out the same steps that lead to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdistb ] ) , yielding the expression : @xmath44    our final result for the distribution of nearest neighbor spacings of model a is simply a gaussian distribution with a width that depends on the relative spatial location , @xmath45 of any given particle .",
    "this corresponds to the same gaussian distribution type as the random amplitudes @xmath11 used to construct the random potential .",
    "the width differs , as the spacings distribution contains a width that is a function of the precise characteristics of the random potential .    in model b",
    ", one can naively compare all of the derived probability densities of nearest neighbor spacings to the probability densities of force couplings given earlier by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gfinalb ] ) , ( [ eq : unifinal ] ) , ( [ eq : binfinal ] ) .",
    "the binary system contains three characteristic peaks in both quantities , showing similar behavior .",
    "furthermore , in the gaussian case both the force couplings and the nearest neighbor spacings follow a convolution of two gaussian distributions .",
    "on the other hand , for the uniform distribution the probability density of nearest neighbor spacings does not follow the logarithmic behavior of the force couplings .",
    "ultimately , this indicates the importance of the distribution type in detailing the equilibrium structural properties of 1dwc systems .",
    "as remarked earlier , the viscosity approximation assumes that the particles will deviate from the ordered lattice by a displacement that is proportional to the total force on each particle when the particles are equally spaced .",
    "this approximation seems reasonable when the disorder is relatively weak compared to the interaction strength of the coloumb force .",
    "however , it is necessary test this hypothesis by performing a numerical relaxation of the particles for both models a and b in finite sized systems .",
    "we detail the procedure and compare the numerical results to our previously derived expressions in the next section .",
    "the numerical relaxation of a disordered 1dwc to its minimum energy configuration requires the development of two major components .",
    "first one must address the complications that arise from performing computations on finite size systems with long ranged interactions .",
    "evidently , the surface effects , as a result of long range interactions in finite sized systems are not negligible . one possible route to dealing with this complication is to enforce periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the standard approach involves the ewald summation technique@xcite .",
    "we have derived our version of the ewald potential displayed as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ewaldf ] ) in appendix [ sec : appb ] , that represents the interaction energy between charges on a periodic image , of which is infinitely repeated to assert the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , the resulting rapidly converging sums still demand computationally intensive efforts .",
    "we have discovered that the summation can be reproduced in closed form in terms of a simple function that reproduces the correct short distance behavior and has the correct periodicity .",
    "consider the lattice summation of the @xmath46 couloumb potential representing the infinite sum of n images of length d. the interaction potential between two particles separated by a distance @xmath47 within a image is given by the expression @xmath48 the result is a simple trigonometric function , of which is easy to implement numerically .",
    "fig.[fig : ewald ] shows a graphical comparison of the expressions ( [ eq : ewaldf ] ) and ( [ eq : exactint ] ) .",
    "next we consider the other required numerical tool .",
    "an energy minimization algorithm is neccessary to find the spatial coordinates at which the particles arrange themselves given a particular realization of disorder in the hamiltonian .",
    "these coordinates satisfy a system of linear equations , namely the simultaneous zeros of the total force on each charge .",
    "a very powerful technique is the newton - raphson(nr ) method@xcite . in the nr method one",
    "recursively computes the hessian or second derivative matrix and multiplies its inverse by the initial positions .",
    "the resulting product is used to increment the coordinates towards the equilibrium configuration .",
    "one interesting property of the hessian matrix is that it is precisely the dynamical matrix one uses to compute the phonon spectrum of a vibrating lattice . in our 1dwc system",
    ", we can examine the plasma oscillations by simply diagonalizing the hessian of a relaxed array of particles . using the interaction potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : exactint ] ) , the hessian of a finite size lattice has the form@xcite        @xmath49        this yields an @xmath50 matrix that can one use to carry out the standard phonon analysis .",
    "we have implemented numerical relaxations on chains of length @xmath51 , for each of the random charge and random field distributions discussed in the previous section .",
    "numerical uncertainty exists in the amount of residual total force acting on a particular charge .",
    "therefore , the charges were relaxed so that the residual forces were only about @xmath52 in relative magnitude(scaled to unity ) , at which point our system is quite close to equilibrium . we have compared the theoretical predictions of the viscosity approximation given by equations ( [ eq : unifinal ] ) , ( [ eq : binfinal ] ) , ( [ eq : gfinalb ] ) , and ( [ eq : rpdistfinal ] ) to the numerical data in figs .",
    "[ fig : unibin ] , [ fig : spacnorm ] .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the viscosity approximation and numerical calculations in terms in the general behavior of the resulting distributions .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that the statistical arrangement of the disorder has an explicit dependence on the distribution type and width .",
    "the correlation is quite striking in the case of the binary random charge system , where the three characteristic peaks are mirrored in both the numerical and analytical plots .",
    "this suggests that an experimental probe of the structural arrangement of disordered systems with long - ranged interactions would reveal a pronounced difference between the chemically disordered binary system and the random potential system , of which represents a form of substrate disorder .",
    "it is also worth noting that the effect could also exist in several soft condensed matter models in which wigner crystal ordering has been discussed in the context of biological systems@xcite .",
    "it is well known that there is a strict absence of long range crystalline order for systems with short - ranged interactions that exist in dimensions @xmath53 , resulting from the prevailing influence of thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "this notion has been explored by various authors@xcite . for wigner crystals in particular ,",
    "the unscreened coulomb interactions factor into these melting criteria through the precise wavevector dependence of the longitudinal and transverse vibrational modes that lead to diverging values of the lindemann parameter @xmath54 in a low enough dimensionality .",
    "as we have demonstrated in the preceding section , the inclusion of quenched disorder induces randomness in particle spacings .",
    "furthermore , another main consequence of the disorder is that eigenmodes are not plane waves .",
    "however , as we will show in our investigation of the bragg peaks , the fourier space is not necessarily destroyed .    in our 1dwc system ,",
    "let us isolate the role of quenched disorder in making the particle array more amorphous while neglecting the known effects of stochastic zero point disturbances studied by other authors@xcite .",
    "again , this is valid in systems in which wigner - like ordering is present but those entropic contributions are suppressed . a more useful route to the exploration of the possibility of long range order involves the structure factor @xmath55 , which can be defined in terms of the equilibrium positions of the ith particle , @xmath56 : @xmath57 the crystalline character of the system will manifest itself through the existence of at least one delta function , or bragg peak , in the spectrum of @xmath55 within some particular scale in fourier space .    from the exact dispersion relation@xcite of the clean 1d wigner crystal , @xmath58 , it has been shown that the correlation functions decay much slower than any power law , @xmath59 ^ 2 } \\right\\rangle   \\propto \\sqrt { \\ln ( x)}$ ] .",

    "systems possessing this sort of decay are usually labeled as having  quasi - long range order\"@xcite .",

    "fig : sfacrf ] and [ fig : sfacrc ] .",
    "the plots suggest a difference between both models in terms of their structural properties .",
    "it appears that both models retain their crystalline composition for a regime of disorder strengths .",
    "moreover , in the high disorder regime , the bragg peaks are lost .",
    "the details of the transition will be examined more carefully in a future work .",
    "a notable difference between the systems is that in model a the bragg peaks strongly resemble delta functions while in model b , the scattering intensity contains an exponentially broadened shoulder tending on both sides of the peak at higher disorder strengths , although the presence of peak shoulders in model b is not evident at low disorder .",
    "hence for weak disorder both models are crystals based on the strictest definition requiring the existence of just one bragg peak .    in order to appropriately make sense of figs .",
    "[ fig : sfacrf ] and [ fig : sfacrc ] one should focus on the first bragg peak and how it behaves as the disorder strength is increased . evidently , the peak height decreases for both models as function of disorder strength .",

    "the localization properties of the plasma eigenstates of models a and b have been explored in detail by the authors of this paper @xcite , where they reported a vibrational delocalization transition at lower eigenfrequencies in model a , while no transition observed in model b. additionally , they performed a finite size scaling analysis that yielded a scaling behavior of the relative interaction strength @xmath61 and an approximate value of the correlation length exponent . in this section",
    "we will focus on other aspects of the plasma eigenstates .",
    "in particular , we will explore multifractal properties of the participation moments , the electronic compressibility of the pure and disordered systems , and the frequency dependent behavior of the ac conductivity .",

    "one can smooth out the fluctuations of @xmath71 by summing over all the eigenstates and ensemble - averaging over several realizations of disorder(represented by the overline bar ) .",
    "this yields the following length dependent quantity for finite - sized systems : @xmath78    for the 3d anderson model the critical scaling properties of @xmath79 were derived by wegner@xcite using renormalization group arguments in a @xmath80 expansion of the 2 particle spectral function of a system of interacting @xmath81 matrices .",

    "in this paper we have considered a wide range of phenomena in 1d disordered wigner solids that follow from the behavior of the plasma oscillations .",
    "we have developed a new mathematical formalism for studying the spatial arrangement of the particles at equilibrium as a consequence of a certain type of randomness in the hamiltonian .",
    "we have applied probability convolutions to quantify the distribution of nearest neighbor particle spacings by assuming the particle coordinates will deviate from crystalline configuration by distances that are proportional to the total force on each particle when the system is ordered .",
    "if one adiabatically `` turns on '' the randomness , one can imagine the charges propagating in a viscous medium , and if the random contribution to the forces on the charges is small a linear relaxation of the particles might be expected to hold as a good approximation .",

    "a stronger statistical analysis will be performed in future papers that will further develop this probability convolution formalism on more rigorous grounds .",
    "we have also explored the basic question of whether a 1dwc in the presence of quenched disorder retains its crystalline composition . we have argued that both a random potential system and a random charge system generate an internal stiffness that resists the system from completely melting in the thermodynamic limit , at least when the effect of randomness is not too great .",

    "we start by examining the case of a uniform distribution of random single charges in model b , in which @xmath123 evidently , nucleons and electrons can only have integer values of the charge @xmath124 , so this particular distribution is unphysical and unrealistic .",

    "we consider the binding of chemical constituents to the wigner crystal such that there are effectively two values of charges random distributed throughout the system : @xmath126 the product distribution simply consists of three peaks at the values @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
