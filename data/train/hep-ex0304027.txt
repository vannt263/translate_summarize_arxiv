    "the decay @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is one of the kaon decays which could probe new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , the decay is relatively poorly measured and there have been only a few experiments that determined the @xmath4 branching ratio  @xcite and the structure - dependent component  @xcite .",
    "other interesting observables for this decay are the components of the muon polarization : @xmath0 which is the t - odd polarization component normal to the decay plane defined as @xmath5 , and @xmath6normal muon polarization ( t  even ) in the decay plane which is sensitive to the values and signs of the kaon vector @xmath7 and axial - vector @xmath8 form factors , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "the contribution to @xmath0 from the standard model is known to be very small @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the t - even transverse polarization due to final state interactions ( fsi ) can mimic the t - odd effect at the @xmath10 level  @xcite .",
    "however , it can be reliably calculated .",
    "therefore , any non - zero value of @xmath0 above the level of fsi or different from the fsi values , if the experimental sensitivity to the polarization is better than @xmath11 , would indicate new physics .",
    "several non - sm models predict non - zero values for @xmath0 in @xmath4 decay  @xcite and from two of them ( susy with r - parity and multi - higgs models without natural flavor conservation ) large values of @xmath12 are expected .    in this letter",
    "we present the first results on @xmath0 obtained in the analysis of the @xmath4 data accumulated in the kek e246 experiment for the 199698 data taking period .",
    "the measurement was performed using the detector constructed to search for t - violating muon polarization in the @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) decay .",
    "the apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e246setup ] ,        and described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a separated @xmath15 beam ( @xmath16 ) of 660 mev/@xmath17 was used with a typical intensity of @xmath18 kaons per 0.6-s spill duration with a repetition of 3 s. a @xmath19erenkov counter with a multiplicity trigger distinguished @xmath15s from @xmath20s with an efficiency of more than 99% .",
    "kaons then were slowed in a al+beo degrader , and stopped in an active target made of 256 scintillating fibers located at the center of a 12-sector superconducting toroidal spectrometer .",
    "a charged particle ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath20 ) from the kaon decay hit one of the twelve fiducial counters surrounding the target and was bent through one of the spectrometer sector gaps and detected by the tof and @xmath21 counters at the entrance of the polarimeter .",
    "tracking of charged particles was provided by the target fibers , a scintillation ring hodoscope surrounding the target and multiwire proportional chambers at the entrance ( c2 ) and exit ( c3 and c4 ) of each magnet sector gap .",
    "the momentum resolution of the whole tracking system was @xmath23=2.6 mev/@xmath17 at 205  mev/@xmath17 .",
    "the energies and angles of the photons were measured by the csi photon calorimeter consisting of 768 csi(tl ) modules @xcite .",
    "the csi(tl ) barrel has twelve holes for the charged particle entry to the toroidal spectrometer and covers a solid angle of about @xmath24  sr .",
    "energy resolution of @xmath25% at 200 mev and angular resolutions of @xmath26 were obtained .",
    "good time resolution of 3.5  ns  ( rms ) at 100 mev allowed us to use the fast csi signal at the trigger level and thereby effectively suppress accidentals in the calorimeter .",
    "muons entering the polarimeter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : e246setup]c ) were degraded by an al+cu block and stopped in a stack of pure al plates . the stopper material ( al )",
    "was chosen because there is no depolarization of muons stopped in aluminum .",
    "positrons from @xmath27 decays of stopped muons were detected by 12 positron counters consisting of three layers of plastic scintillators which were located azimuthally between the muon stoppers .",
    "the time spectra of the positrons were recorded by multi - stop tdcs .",
    "a three - level trigger for selection of events was used . at the first level ,",
    "a signal from the kaon ring in the @xmath19erenkov detector followed by a hit in at least one fiducial counter in coincidence with signals from the tof and @xmath21 counters of a corresponding magnet sector were required .",
    "the second level trigger required at least one hit in the csi(tl ) calorimeter , and the third level trigger required the triple coincidence signal from the positron counter arrays adjacent to the corresponding magnet sector within 20  @xmath28s after the first level trigger .",
    "the t - violating asymmetry was extracted using a double ratio as : @xmath29 \\label{atdr}\\ ] ] here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the sums over all 12 sectors of counts of clockwise ( @xmath32 ) and counter - clockwise ( @xmath33 ) emitted positrons .",
    "indices @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote two classes of events : forward events ( @xmath34 ) when the angle between the photon and the beam direction ( z - axis ) was less than @xmath36 and backward events ( @xmath35 ) when the angle between the photon and the beam direction was more than @xmath37 .",
    "the signal values @xmath30 and @xmath31 were extracted by integrating the positron time spectrum in the polarimeter after subtraction of the background .",
    "the signal integration region was chosen to be from 20 ns to 6 @xmath28s and the background fitting region for the background extraction was from 6.0 to 19.5 @xmath28s .",
    "the sign of @xmath38 for events with forward - going photons is opposite to that for events with backward - going photons .",
    "this allows us to employ a double ratio method which is a powerful technique for reduction of most systematic errors .",
    "moreover , considerable reduction of systematic effects was achieved from the azimuthal symmetry of the 12-gap detector and the use of the same positron detector as a @xmath32 for one gap and a @xmath33 detector for the adjacent gap .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is related to @xmath40 by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the analyzing power of the polarimeter , @xmath43 is an angular attenuation factor and @xmath44 is the overall fraction of all backgrounds .",
    "the main problem of the @xmath4 analysis is the rejection of the predominant @xmath14 background with only one photon ( @xmath45 ) from the @xmath46 decay detected by the csi calorimeter .",
    "the extraction of @xmath4 events was performed in two stages .",
    "the first stage was mostly identical to that of the main ( @xmath14 ) e246 analysis and was used to suppress @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) background decays .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath47 decays were rejected using a cut on the muon momentum @xmath53 mev/@xmath17 selecting the @xmath54 muons in the region of 100 - 190 mev/@xmath17 , as illustrated in fig .",

    ".,width=453 ]    most of the muons from @xmath48 events , in which @xmath20 decays in - flight , were rejected by applying the tracking cut @xmath55 .",
    "these events had kinks , i.e. the tracks did not point back to the kaon vertex .",
    "the @xmath52 backgrounds were negligible due to the combination of several suppressing factors : acceptance of the magnet spectrometer ( the endpoints of charged particle momentum spectra for both decays are quite low : 125 and 133 mev / c , respectively ) , the low probability of detecting these decays as one - photon events and , finally , most of @xmath20s were stopped in the cu degrader and did not reach the polarimeter .",
    "the @xmath49 events were removed using a time - of - flight method by imposing a geometric cut on the two - dimensional spectrum of a charged particle mass calculated from time - of - flight vs. the energy deposited in the tof counter ( fig .",

    "the `` cloud '' in the bottom - left corner corresponds to positrons , the events inside the rectangle are muons.,width=453 ]    the background from accidental photons in the csi(tl ) detector was suppressed using a photon energy threshold of 50 mev and by requiring a coincidence between a photon signal in the csi and a signal in the fiducial and tof counters from a charged particle within a window of @xmath56  ns .",
    "background associated with the beam was suppressed by a veto counter system surrounding the beam region .",
    "the second stage of the analysis was aimed at the extraction of @xmath4 events and the rejection of @xmath14 decays . due to the precise measurement of the muon momentum and the photon energy and direction ,",
    "the kinematics of @xmath57 and @xmath58 decays can be reconstructed completely  @xcite .",
    "the kinematic parameters such as missing mass squared @xmath59 , the angle between the muon and the photon , @xmath60 , and the neutrino momentum , @xmath61 , can be efficiently used to suppress the @xmath57 background .",

    "these values are both non - zero and have opposite signs consistent with the expectation .",
    "that indicates a strong signature of the correct @xmath4 selection and the suppression of one - photon @xmath14 events .    in monte carlo simulations",

    "both these backgrounds only dilute the sensitivity to @xmath0 , but they do not produce any spurious t - violating asymmetry . using mc data the background decay fractions were estimated to be @xmath104% and @xmath105% .",

    "the theoretical uncertainty of the @xmath109 value is about @xmath110% and is connected with the uncertainties of @xmath7 and @xmath8 values . for the final result we subtract @xmath109 from the measured @xmath0 value which gives @xmath111 and as the @xmath109 uncertainty is more than two orders of magnitude less than the statistical error",
    "we do not include that uncertainty in the @xmath0 error .",
    "the main systematic error contributions to @xmath0 come from the presence of the two large components of the muon in - plane polarization , @xmath112 which is parallel to the muon momentum and @xmath6 ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "however , most of their contribution is canceled by the azimuthal symmetry of the detector as well as by the @xmath114 ratio .",
    "the largest instrumental systematic errors are due to the misalignment of the polarimeter , the asymmetry of the magnetic field distribution , and the asymmetric kaon stopping distribution .",
    "the @xmath114 ratio efficiently reduces these contributions .",
    "additionally , a non - zero value of @xmath0 for the @xmath14 background would contribute to the systematic error of @xmath0 for @xmath4 , but that was measured in the main e246 analysis with much higher accuracy and is consistent with zero  @xcite @xmath115 .",
