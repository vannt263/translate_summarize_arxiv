    "charge transfer ( ct ) reactions are of fundamental and broad importance in chemistry , biochemistry , and materials science @xcite .",
    "the ct rate and mechanism are determined by diagonal site energies and off - diagonal transfer integrals of the hamiltonian matrix , which are thus key to elucidating and potentially controlling the reaction @xcite .    for quantitative evaluation of the hamiltonian matrix elements",
    ", the effects of orbital relaxation and electron correlation can be significant .",
    "the state - of - the - art wave function approaches such as the multi - reference configuration - interaction and the coupled - cluster methods are still computationally expensive @xcite , especially for combining with molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the recently emerging long - range corrected ( lc ) density functional theory ( dft ) is attractive , as it takes an improved account of the ct interaction by reducing the self - interaction error in dft while maintaining the short - range dynamic correlation effects @xcite .",
    "this aspect on the redox site energies has been examined recently by a nonempirically tuned range - separated ( net rs )  dft @xcite , in which the range - separation parameter for decomposing the two - electron coulomb interaction is optimized in accord with janak s theorem to reproduce the ionization potential ( ip ) and electron affinity by the orbital energies of highest - occupied ( ho ) and lowest - unoccupied kohn - sham ( ks ) molecular orbitals ( mos ) @xcite . the optimal parameters for the nucleobases of dna and rna have been thus reported @xcite",
    ".    however , the parameters optimal for the intramolecular site energies are not necessarily equally appropriate for the off - diagonal intermolecular transfer integrals . nonetheless , we know empirically that the off - diagonal energies are approximated by the average of diagonal energies multiplied by the overlap integral and an empirical factor , as known prototypically for the extended hckel method .",
    "in addition , the one - electron mean - field picture has been considered appropriate for the transfer integrals @xcite due to cancelation of the dynamic electron - correlation effect , as the transfer integrals correspond to the difference between the energies of two adiabatic electronic states at the diabatic surface crossing .",
    "these aspects are thus intriguing for quantitative evaluation .",
    "the method for computing the off - diagonal transfer integrals is not unique : it depends on the definition of basis states .",
    "this is analogous to the arbitrariness in defining the diabatic states for non - adiabatic transitions @xcite .",
    "when the redox sites or moieties are spatially well - defined , as is the case for the @xmath0-stack dna nucleobases , the mos of isolated fragments provide a reasonable choice , as employed in the conventional fragment - orbital approaches @xcite .",
    "however , the mos optimized for isolated fragments lack the orbital relaxation induced by the long - range coulomb and short - range exchange interactions . if we are to include these interactions , we need to handle large systems and have to determine the procedure for transforming the resulting delocalized canonical mos to localized diabatic bases .",
    "thus , there exists a practical trade - off between the inclusion of orbital relaxation and the diabatization .",
    "the methods of constrained dft @xcite and frozen density embedding @xcite are recently proposed prescriptions to this problem .    in this work we put forward another solution by employing the method of fragment molecular orbitals ( fmo ) @xcite and their linear combinations ( fmo - lcmo ) @xcite .",
    "the fmo - lcmo method was originally proposed to obtain canonical mos of large systems @xcite .",
    "the fmo method first decomposes the total system into fragments and optimizes the mos of each fragment self - consistently under the coulomb field of other fragments .",
    "then , dimer , trimer , or tetramer calculations are carried out to take account of the exchange interactions . in the fmo - lcmo method , the diagonal elements of hamiltonian matrix of the total system are computed from the results of these fragment calculations in a form to remove the excess counting of energy , whereas the off - diagonal elements are constructed from the dimer or trimer matrices projected to the monomer fmo space .",
    "the total hamiltonian matrix is then diagonalized to find the canonical mos of the entire system .",
    "now , it is seen that the hamiltonian matrix before the diagonalization provides appropriate diagonal site energies and off - diagonal transfer integrals for the study of ct reactions .    after formulating this idea in section [ sec : method ] ,",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents an assessment of the scheme on benchmark systems and numerical applications to @xmath0-stack dna nucleobases .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes and concludes .",
    "here we outline the fmo - lcmo method @xcite . for simplicity , we restrict to the fmo2 version with dimer exchange , although extension to the trimer fmo3 is straightforward @xcite . in the fmo2 method",
    ", the orbitals of each fragment are optimized self - consistently under the coulomb field of other fragments .",
    "the resultant @xmath1th orbital of fragment @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the fragment dimer calculations are then carried out under the coulomb field of other monomer fragments determined above . in the fmo - lcmo method ,",
    "the intra- and inter - fragment hamiltonian matrix elements are defined by @xmath4 in which @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the ks ( or fock ) matrices of fragment @xmath2 and fragment dimer @xmath7 , respectively . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : htotipiq ] ) and ( [ eq : htotipjq ] ) , the notation @xmath8 represents the dimer ks matrix projected to the monomer orbital space .",
    "the diagonalization of this @xmath9 has been demonstrated to give accurate approximations to the canonical mos and mo energies of large systems @xcite .",
    "the proposal in this work is to employ the matrix elements of @xmath9 for the orbital site energies @xmath10 and the transfer integrals @xmath11 of ct systems .",
    "as seen from the procedure described above , they include the orbital relaxation from the self - consistent coulomb field and the pairwise exchange interactions .",
    "this can be an advantage over methods that employ orbitals optimized for isolated fragments .    because the orbitals of different fragments are optimized separately in the fmo method , they are in general non - orthogonal with finite overlaps @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the transfer integrals appropriate for description of ct processes are @xmath14 from symmetric - orthogonalized orbitals @xcite .    in",
    "what follows , we will compare the fmo - lcmo with the fragment - orbital approach ( foa ) @xcite and the generalized mulliken - hush ( gmh ) method @xcite .",
    "both foa and gmh have been often employed and well documented in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , we outline them below for convenience .    in the foa , the orbitals @xmath15 are first optimized for isolated monomers .",
    "next , the ks matrix of aimed complex ( a dimer or larger assembly of fragment monomers ) , @xmath16 , is constructed with or without orbital optimization .",
    "the site energies @xmath17 and transfer integrals @xmath18 are then computed with @xmath19 because the orbitals of different fragments are not orthogonal , similarly to the case of fmo - lcmo noted above , the transfer integrals @xmath20 are computed with the formula equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tprime ] ) .    in the gmh method for hole transfers with a one - electron ks - mo",
    "approach @xcite , the transfer integral @xmath20 is approximated by the homo ( h ) and homo-1 ( m ) energy difference for the neutral dimer fragment of sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 , scaled by the dipole moment matrix elements with respect to the two mos as @xmath23 @xmath24 here , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the mo coefficients for the dimer fragment in the atomic orbital ( ao ) representation and @xmath27 are the dipole matrix element between the aos @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "all electronic calculations in this letter were performed on neutral monomers , dimers , and octomers using the gamess program @xcite .",
    "we first assess the nonempirically tuned range - separated ( net rs ) functional for transfer integrals .",
    "the reference data are taken from a benchmark database @xcite with high - level _ ab initio _ calculations of multireference configuration interaction ( mrci+q ) and @xmath30-electron valence state perturbation theory ( nevpt2 ) . from the database we have chosen imidazole and furane homo - dimer cations because their molecular structures are most related to the nucleobases .",
    "the optimal values of range - separation parameter @xmath31 in the formula @xmath32 with the lc - becke@xcite - lee - yang - parr@xcite ( lc - blyp ) functional @xcite for imidazole and furane monomers were searched with the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and were found to be @xmath33 bohr@xmath34 for both molecules .",
    "here we used the cc - pvtz basis set for heavy atoms and cc - pvdz for hydrogens , although ref . @xcite employed aug - cc - pvtz for the former .",
    "however , the results displayed in figure 1 present high accuracy . by contrast , the standard b3lyp functional @xcite systematically underestimates the transfer integrals for both systems .",
    "the figure also indicate that the results from fmo - lcmo and foa with the same functional are almost identical .",
    "the numerical values are listed in table s1 of the supplementary materials .",
    "we now proceed to the nucleobase molecules .",
    "the optimal values of the parameter @xmath31 with the lc - blyp functional and cc - pvtz basis set have been reported ( in bohr@xmath34 ) as 0.2738 for guanine ( g ) , 0.2853 for adenine ( a ) , 0.2948 for cytosine ( c ) , and 0.2850 for thymine ( t ) @xcite .",
    "these were optimized separately for each nucleobase . however , we need to determine a single value for the computation of intermolecular transfer integrals , for which we have chosen @xmath35 because the latter three nucleobases have approximately this value . with this",
    "we then reexamined the site energies .",
    "the nuclear coordinates are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the resultant homo-1 and homo energies are displayed in figure 2 .",
    "they are compared with those from the original optimal @xmath31 for each nucleobase and with the corresponding experimental ips @xcite .",
    "the numerical values are listed in table s2 of the supplementary materials .",
    "we see that the parameter @xmath35 yields the orbital energies sufficiently close to those with the optimal @xmath31 for each nucleobase .",
    "we have also carried out calculations with 6 - 31g(d ) basis set in an aim to compare with the previous works @xcite , which will be discussed in section [ subsec : basepair ] .",
    "although the 6 - 31g(d ) basis set systematically underestimate the absolute values , the relative homo energies among the nucleobases , the most relevant quantities for the hole transfers , indicated by the slope of the plots are similar among the methods and the experiment .",
    "having in scope the calculations of larger systems , it is desired to keep the size of basis - set as small as possible .",
    "we thus employ the 6 - 31g(d ) basis - set hereafter , until we examine the basis - set dependence in section [ subsec : basiseffect ] .      here",
    "we examine the ct energies for nucleobase pairs in a @xmath0-stack configuration .",
    "as guanine is the key donor with the lowest ip , we study gg , ga , ag , gt , and tg pairs . the nuclear coordinates are taken from ref . @xcite . because the reference data from caspt2 calculation @xcite corresponds to the adiabatic energy gap rather than the diabatic site energy difference , we have also calculated the adiabatic energy gaps from the diabatic site energies and the transfer integrals .",
    "the numerical values are listed in table s3 of the supplementary materials .",
    "the resultant adiabatic energy gaps and transfer integrals are plotted in figure 3 for the lc - blyp functional with @xmath35 compared to b3lyp and caspt2 .",
    "figure 3a indicates that the adiabatic energy gaps from lc - blyp are closer to caspt2 .",
    "we also see that the values from fmo - lcmo and foa with the same functional coincide well to be indistinguishable in the figure ; the difference is approximately 1 mev as seen in table s3 .",
    "the difference between fmo - lcmo and foa is in the treatment of orbital relaxation of the basis mos .",
    "it is included in the former while not in the latter .",
    "this effect is more apparent in the transfer integrals discussed next .",
    "figure 3b compares the transfer integrals @xmath36 . for both lc - blyp and b3lyp functionals ,",
    "fmo - lcmo and gmh coincide well for ag , gt , and tg .",
    "notably , their deviation from foa is now apparent .",
    "this is due to the effect of orbital relaxation that is included in gmh and fmo - lcmo but not in foa .",
    "the numerical values of the transfer integrals are listed in table s4 of the supplementary materials .",
    "figure 3b also indicates that the transfer integrals from caspt2 notably deviate from both lc - blyp and b3lyp .",
    "considering the accuracy of lc - blyp confirmed in figure 1 and the limited active orbital space employed in the caspt2 @xcite , we have tested a gmh calculation with the energy gap from caspt2 and the dipole moment matrix elements from lc - blyp .",
    "the results denoted by @xmath31-alt  in figure 3b are now close to lc - blyp",
    ". it would be plausible that the limited caspt2 calculations yield more reliable energy gaps than dipole matrix elements .",
    "we also note in figure 3b that b3lyp underestimates the transfer integrals for all the nucleobase pairs , the same tendency as was observed in figure 1 .",
    "next , we study a larger system , an adenine octomer in the idealized b - dna @xmath0-stack configuration ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the structure of atoms other than hydrogen are constructed by using the web-3dna software @xcite .",
    "the positions of hydrogen atoms are optimized for each isolated adenine by b3lyp/6 - 31g(d ) calculation .    as discussed above ,",
    "one major difference between foa and fmo - lcmo is in the treatment of orbital relaxation .",
    "another difference is in the scaling of computational cost along the system size . in the standard use of foa ,",
    "the basis mos are computed for each isolated monomer of donor and acceptor molecules .",
    "then , the ks matrix of the entire donor - acceptor system is constructed , over which the matrix elements on the basis mos from the monomer calculation are computed ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : foasitee ] ) and ( [ eq : foatij ] ) ) . therefore , to study the system of figure 4 , for instance , the full ks matrix @xmath37 of the entire eight molecules should be calculated .",
    "this will quickly become computationally prohibitive as the system size increases .",
    "an evasion of this size - scaling problem in foa would be to reduce the size of ks matrix to the dimer @xmath38 for each donor - acceptor pair .",
    "in such cases , in order to take account of the orbital relaxation , the calculations may be performed under the classical electrostatic , or the molecular - mechanical ( mm ) , field from the other molecules .",
    "@xcite we thus first determine the effective atomic charges derived from the electrostatic potential ( esp ) of an isolated alanine monomer , in which both the structure and mos are computed at the b3lyp/6 - 31g(d ) level .",
    "the results displayed in figure s1 of the supplementary materials indicate that they are consistent with the amber 94 force - field @xcite .",
    "we now compute the basis mos of each monomer in figure 4 under the classical field from the esp charges of others .",
    "the ks matrix of donor - acceptor pairs are similarly computed under the classical field of remaining molecules .",
    "this procedure is denoted by dimer in mm .",
    "the ordinary foa without the mm field is denoted by dimer in vac(uum ) .",
    "these methods are summarized in table 1 with respect to the orbital relaxation effect in the basis mos and the ks matrix ."
