    "@xmath0-physics has been attracting an increasing attention recently , due to the experimental discovery of the @xmath0 meson@xcite , and theoretical progress@xcite .",
    "since one can collect a high - statistics sample of @xmath0 mesons only at high energy hadronic colliders@xcite , we have re - written a generator for the hadronic production of @xmath0 .",
    "the generator is a fortran program package called bcvegpy .",
    "the hadronic production of the @xmath0 and @xmath3 mesons bound system is in @xmath4 , and according to pdg it is denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "the first excited state @xmath5 is due to the spin - splitting ( spin - spin interaction ) and it is denoted by @xmath3 throughout the paper .",
    "since the spin - splitting is small , the available energy of the decays from @xmath3 to @xmath0 is so small that only dipole magnetic moment transition ( m1 ) is allowed between them .",
    "] has been estimated by the authors of refs.@xcite with the fragmentation approach and by the authors of refs.@xcite with the so - called ` complete calculation ' approach i.e. to compute the production completely at the lowest order ( @xmath6 ) in terms of the dominant subprocess of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xmath7 .",
    "further note that since @xmath8 , apart from the fact that @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks combine into @xmath11 non - perturbatively , the rest of the subprocess is always ` hard ' and can be well calculated with pqcd@xcite .",
    "these two approaches have different advantages but both of them are in the framework of pqcd , and attribute the non - perturbative factor in the production to the decay constant , @xmath12 the non - relativistic wave function of the @xmath11 at the origin ( the former through the fragmentation function and the latter directly ) . within theoretical uncertainties",
    ", the two approaches can agree numerically , especially when the component of gluon fragmentation is involved@xcite .",
    "the fragmentation approach is comparatively simple and can reach to leading logarithm order ( llo ) of pqcd , but is satisfied only in the case if one is only interested in the produced @xmath11 itself .",
    "the complete calculation approach has the great advantage that it retains the information about the @xmath13 and @xmath14 quark ( jets ) associated with the @xmath0 meson in the production . from the experimental point of view",
    "this is a more relevant case .",
    "therefore , we have written the hadronic production programme for @xmath0 mesons based on the complete calculation approach ( full pqcd complete calculation at the lowest order @xmath6 ) .    since the non - perturbative factor in the subprocess @xmath15 , i.e. the decay constant of the @xmath11 meson ,",
    "can be calculated by means of the potential model for heavy quark - antiquark systems@xcite , the estimates of the production are full theoretical predictions of pqcd without additional experimental input . in view of future experimental studies of the @xmath11 after the cdf discovery ( run - i , at tevatron ) , i.e. , concerning the needs of experimental feasibility studies for various topics of @xmath11 meson in hadronic collisions at tevatron and lhc meson with the same approach , but the computer programs have not been published ( or not easy to find ) , so we would like to present ours by re - writing the program and comparing it with others . ] , we would like to write a paper on the fortran package bcvegpy with detailed explanation .",
    "in addition , we emphasize here that , as explained later , the present generator has been formulated in a very different way from those in refs.@xcite , and through carefully comparing the results obtained by bcvegpy with those obtained in refs.@xcite , a solid and independent check of bcvegpy is well made .    at lhc",
    "the beam luminosity and the production cross section ( at such a high energy @xmath16tev ) are so high that the rate of producing @xmath11 events can be @xmath17 per year . at tevatron , although the luminosity and production cross section are lower than at lhc , the rate of producing @xmath11 events still is about @xmath18 per year , only @xmath19 orders of magnitude lower than at lhc .",
    "the @xmath0 meson has sizable and abundant weak decay modes relating directly to @xmath9 or / and @xmath20 flavor respectively , so that with so high production such as at lhc , even the detecting efficiencies being taken into account , one can reach a statistical accuracy of @xmath21 for most of the decay modes@xcite .",
    "thus there is an acute need for a @xmath11 event generator in order to be able to perform feasibility studies , and this is why we have written the present paper on bcvegpy .",
    "a particularly interesting topic , which is worth noting here , is the study of @xmath22 mixing and @xmath23 violation in @xmath24 meson decays through @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 meson has a very large branching ratio to decay to a @xmath24 meson ( @xmath26 several tens percents@xcite ) , and the @xmath24 mesons obtained by such @xmath0 decays are tagged precisely at the @xmath0 decay vertex , if the charge of the @xmath0 meson and/or its decay products are measured .",
    "a large - statistics sample of tagged @xmath24 mesons at lhc , and even at tevatron , offers a great potential for the interesting @xmath24 physics@xcite .    as pointed out in ref.@xcite ,",
    "according to pqcd there is another production mechanism by a quark pair annihilation subprocess @xmath27 .",
    "nevertheless , the ` luminosity ' of gluons is much higher than that of quarks in @xmath28 collisions ( lhc ) and in @xmath29 collisions ( tevatron ) , and there is a suppression factor due to the virtual gluon propagator in the annihilation .",
    "therefore the contribution from this mechanism is negligible compared to the dominant one .",
    "the calculations in refs.@xcite neglected the contribution from the quark pair mechanism , and the bcvegpy package follows the same approximation .    in order to make the programme very compact , we write bcvegpy by applying the ` helicity technique ' to the amplitude of the subprocess .",
    "the technique may be traced back to the work in ref.@xcite .",
    "the helicity technique has been developed by the calkul collaboration@xcite for massless gauge theories .",
    "further development for the massive fermion case with abelian gauge field(s ) as well as for the massless fermion case with non - abelian gauge field(s ) was done by several groups@xcite . when the helicities of all the external massless particles are fixed , calkul calculates the ` probability rate ' in the following way .",
    "first , feynman diagrams with precise helicities for the external particles are computed one by one for the concerned process with helicity techniques , and a complex number for each feynman diagram is obtained .",
    "then all the obtained complex numbers are summed up .",
    "finally the squared modulus of the summed result is taken , averaging over the helicities of the particles in initial state and summing over the helicities of the particles in final state if an unpolarized case is considered .",
    "if a polarized process is considered , one needs only to stop the calculation before averaging over the helicities of the particles in initiate state and summing over the helicities of the particles in final state .",
    "the massless spinor technique may , in fact , be applied to the case where massive fermion(s ) and non - abelian gauge field(s ) are involved in the concerned process , if a suitable ` generalization ' could be done together with some further rearrangements .",
    "our present subprocess contains non - abelian gluons and massive fermions .",
    "thus , in order to make use of the massless spinor technique for obtaining a compact result , we need a suitable generalization with appropriate rearrangements .",
    "we will describe the procedure here below .",
    "our strategy for the generalization is to convert the problem into an equivalent ` massless ' one and to extend the ` symmetries ' as much as possible .",
    "then we try to apply the symmetries of the converted amplitude and the helicity technique to the present problem so as to make the programme compact . according to pqcd , at order @xmath6",
    "there are 36 feynman diagrams for the ` hard ' subprocess @xmath30 . to extend the symmetries for the amplitude corresponding to the 36 diagrams , we neither consider the color factors nor distinguish the flavors of the fermion lines at the moment .",
    "then , these diagrams may be grouped into only a few typical ones according to the fermion lines and the structures of the contained @xmath31-matrices on the lines in the feynman diagrams , because of the feynman diagram symmetries .",
    "to apply the symmetries in writing up the program , we first focus on the numerator of the amplitude related to each typical fermion line , and deal with the @xmath31-matrices precisely .",
    "we then , having suitable four - momentum set for the numerator and denominator , respectively implement proper numerator factors for the fermion lines : color factors , suitable denominator and spinors ( corresponding to the external lines ) @xmath32 .",
    "finally we obtain an exact and full typical fermion line , which appears in feynman diagrams .",
    "when all kinds of typical fermion line factors , factors for external lines of gluons and gluon propagators are ` assembled ' , then the full term , corresponding to the feynman diagram of the amplitude , is achieved .",
    "the resulting program is indeed very compact and potentially reduces the execution time significantly . in general , to write an amplitude according to helicities , each massive fermion line should be decomposed into two light - like spinor lines , but this is not unique@xcite .",
    "here we use the identity @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is a light - like four - momentum ) to simplify the fermion ( quark ) lines by spinor products .    to verify that the program bcvegpy is correct , we check it by taking the same parameters as in ref.@xcite , compute the cross - section of the subprocess @xmath35 by integrating out the unobserved variables numerically , and compare the obtained results with those in ref.@xcite carefully . since bcvegpy is based on helicity techniques which is totally different from those in ref.@xcite , the comparison is a very good check both for bcvegpy and for that in ref.@xcite .",
    "since the mass difference between @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] is small , the @xmath38 decays through an electromagnetic transition ( m1 ) @xmath39 with an almost 100% branching ratio and the photon in the decay is quite soft , so the production of @xmath3 can be considered as an additional source of @xmath0 production ( with an additional soft photon ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath40 for @xmath0 , the polarizations of @xmath14 and/or @xmath13-jets will be lost during their hadronization , so the polarization effects including those of @xmath14 and/or @xmath13-jets in the production of @xmath0 are therefore not interesting , so bcvegpy program calculates the process for the un - polarized case only , although theoretically it can work out certain polarization effects due to @xmath41 and/or @xmath14 and/or @xmath13-jets .",
    "we write the bcvegpy package following the format of pythia@xcite so that the generator could be easily adapted into the pythia environment . in this way",
    "our generator can be used for generating complete events . to increase the monte carlo simulation efficiency for high dimensional phase space integration",
    ", we set up a switch in bcvegpy to choose if the vegas program for obtaining the sampling importance function is used or not .",
    "we also use several parameters , such as for the maximum differential cross sections etc , to meet the needs for the initializations of pythia .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we show how to extend the symmetries by : focussing the @xmath31-matrix strings of fermion lines in feynman diagrams , disregarding color- and numeral factors @xmath32 ; decomposing the three- and four - gluon coupling vertices ; grouping the decomposed diagrams ; establishing the typical one in each group ; applying the symmetries and helicity techniques to the problem . in section iii",
    "we outline the structure of bcvegpy , explain how to use the programme and test ( check ) the programme as stated in the introduction .",
    "section iv summarizes the conclusions and future prospects .",
    "the details about the helicity functions for the amplitude , polarization vector for @xmath42 $ ] , routines and functions for the helicity amplitude are described in the appendices .",
    "based on the factorization of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , the hard subprocess play the key role of the @xmath0 generator . in hadron collisions at high energies ,",
    "the subprocess gluon - gluon fusion @xmath43 is the dominant one in hadronic production of @xmath11 mesons meson , with such small components one can not find a subprocess in an order lower in pqcd for the @xmath0 hadronic production .",
    "this is contrary to the case of @xmath44 production ( @xmath44 has a hidden flavor , while the @xmath0 has explicit flavors ) .",
    "therefore it is certain that the subprocess is dominant . ] . in the following sub - sections",
    ", we will show how to deal with this subprocess .",
    "at the lowest order @xmath6 , there are totally 36 feynman diagrams as shown in figs .  1 - 5 for the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath45 , so accordingly there are 36 terms in the production amplitude . as stated in the introduction , we group the feynman diagrams into five sets according to the structure of the fermion lines . here",
    "there are five subsets as indicated in figs .  1 - 5 . to write the amplitude corresponding to the feynman diagrams explicitly , let us first focus on writing the color structures of the diagrams separately .",
    "in fact there are five independent color factors , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 are the color indices of the quarks @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "they are @xmath52\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to make the final amplitude compact , we introduce two extra color factors , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which satisfy @xmath55-                     \\frac{1}{2n}(t^{a}t^{b})_{ij}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ c^{\\prime}_{6ij}&=&c_{4ij}-c_{6ij}=(t^{c}t^{b}t^{a}t^{c})_{ij}=                     \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}tr[t^{b}t^{a}]-                     \\frac{1}{2n}(t^{b}t^{a})_{ij}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all the color factors in the subprocess can be expressed by the above five independent color factors , @xmath12 in the amplitude all the color factors may be written in terms of these five explicitly . to obtain the desired result ,",

    "note that in all the above equations we have omitted the factor @xmath72 ( the fourth power of the qcd coupling constant ) , so we should consider it when evaluating the final result .",
    "for convenience , we group the terms ( feynman diagrams ) according to the character of the gluon attachment to the fermion lines .",
    "the details will be explained in the next sections .    under the non - relativistic approximation , for the weak binding system of ( @xmath73 ) we have @xmath74 and the wave function @xmath75 can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 for the pseudoscalar @xmath79)$ ] and @xmath80 , @xmath81 for the vector @xmath82)$ ] .",
    "the radial part of the momentum space wave function @xmath83 is related to the space - time wave function at origin by the integration : @xmath84      in ref.@xcite , a method is proposed for treating the amplitude of the processes , which contain massless fermions and non - abelian gauge boson(s ) , in order to make the result compact and to avoid numerical cancellations between very large numbers .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite group the feynman diagrams of the concerned process into gauge - invariant subsets according to how the lines of the gauge bosons attach to the fermion lines .",
    "they then choose convenient gauges for the subsets independently of each other ( not a unique gauge for the whole process ) , and finally they obtain a compact result , when all terms of the amplitude are written according to the helicities of the fermions .",
    "the key point of the approach ( helicity technique ) is that when all the massless fermions are written on helicity state basis , then it is straightforward to choose convenient gauges for all subsets .",
    "if massive fermions are involved in the concerned process and one wishes to use the same technique , then one needs to generalize it",
    ". some rearrangements , such as replacing one massive fermion by two massless fermions @xmath32 , should be made , and the gauge choice for each subset is more complicated than in the massless cases . in the present case for the subprocess @xmath85 , a unique gauge for the whole amplitude is more practical .",
    "apart from the gauge choice , we apply the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite as much as possible to make the program compact .",
    "the polarization vectors of the gluons are replaced by @xmath31-matrix elements of massless fermion helicity states and the color factors are dealt with independently from the dirac @xmath31-matrix strings .",
    "furthermore , we try to make the amplitude more symmetric by applying a decomposition of the terms when writing the program .",
    "this is achieved by decomposing first the terms , which contain three- or / and four - gluon vertices , into terms without self - interactions of gluons .",
    "then , according to the structure of the contained fermion lines , some of the decomposed terms are chosen as ` coordinators ' , which would be called as the typical ones , so that all the other terms , referring to the feynman diagrams , may be ` expressed ' by the ` typical ones ' . therefore when writing the program , only different typical feynman diagrams need to be written precisely , while the non - typical ones may be generated by means of the typical ones according to the relationship ( expression ) . in this section ,",
    "we show how to decompose the terms in the feynman diagrams containing three- or four - gluon vertex(ices ) into terms similar to the typical ones , disregarding the difference in color factors , and list the results for the typical feynman diagrams .",
    "first of all , let us introduce a massless fermion with an arbitrary light - like reference momentum @xmath86 and its relevant helicity spinors ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) , and then construct the requested massive fermion four - spinors @xmath89 and @xmath90 with momentum @xmath91 in terms of @xmath92 as follows : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the spin of the massive spinors , while @xmath95 is the helicity of the massless spinor . for convenience",
    "we adopt the explicit form for the polarization vectors @xmath96 of the gluon with momentum @xmath34 as in calkul .",
    "when the helicity states @xmath97 and @xmath98 of two massless fermions are defined as @xmath92 , but the fermions have a light - like momentum @xmath99 and a referred one @xmath100 respectively , the polarization vectors @xmath96 of the gluon with momentum @xmath34 may be represented as follows : @xmath101 throughout the paper @xmath102 and @xmath103 denotes @xmath104 and its complex conjugation respectively .    because the light - like momenta @xmath105 and @xmath106 can be chosen arbitrarily , we choose them to be the same as a light - like momentum @xmath107 , which is the reference momentum for all massive spinors and gluon polarization vectors .",
    "we take one gauge for the whole set of 36 feynman diagrams , that is convenient here and different from calkul where different gauges are taken for different gauge - invariant subsets .",
    "the gluon self - coupling vertices do not adapt well for being simplified by using the polarization vector in calculating the amplitude .",
    "hence an effort to replace the part with the gluon self - coupling of the diagrams by the so - called qed - like ones ( without gluon self - coupling ) is described here .",
    "this approach is not straightforward , due to the fact that the gluon self - coupling diagrams with massive quarks can not be mapped completely into the qed - like diagrams as in the case of the massless quark condition@xcite . in the massive quark case ,",
    "some additional functions need to be introduced .",
    "fortunately , for the ` simple ' subprocess , these ` extra ' functions for the three - gluon vertices are just parts of the diagrams with four - gluon vertices .",
    "thus the diagrams involving four - gluon coupling vertices just need to be decomposed according to their color factors and there is no need to reduce their @xmath31 matrix and spinor factors any further .    to decompose feynman diagrams with self - interactions into those without any , we need to deal with some of the so - called ` basic structures ' . the number of the ` basic structures ' required for a specific process increases with the number of the gluons involved in the concerned process . for the subprocess , @xmath108 , to convert the necessary parts to the ` basic structures '",
    ", only the parts containing a three - gluon coupling vertex have to be decomposed .",
    "thus let us outline the decomposition for the concerned subprocess .",
    "the decomposition of a three - gluon coupling vertex is shown in fig.[vertex ] ( the first structure ) : a three - gluon vertex @xmath109 through a gluon propagator @xmath110 couples to a quark line with a quark - gluon - quark vertex @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , @xmath114 are color factors at the two vertices .",
    "it is @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the momenta of the fermion legs at the vertex .",
    "since @xmath118 so the precise expression is @xmath119    if the factor @xmath120 , the propagator scalar factor and the color factor are disregarded , and the symbol @xmath121 is used for an equality modulo these factors , we have @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the mass of the fermion . here",
    "the gluons and fermions may not be on - shell .",
    "if the first and the second terms on the right - hand side are embedded in the diagrams , the basic qed - like diagrams may be obtained , while the rest terms @xmath124 on the right - hand side can be absorbed into several extra functions .    ):",
    "the first two terms are the ` basic qed - like ' terms and the ` remaining ' terms are expressed by several extra basic functions.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to relate to the ` basic structures ' , two further decompositions are shown in fig.[basic1 ] ( the second structure ) and fig.[basic2 ] ( the third structure ) respectively : a three - gluon vertex @xmath125 is coupled to a quark line , which has two vertices of quark - gluon - quark @xmath126 and @xmath127 . to be precise , we label the latter vertex with the symbol ` @xmath128 ' on the quark line . in the present case",
    "the two external quark lines are both on - shell and then these two structures can be simplified by using the on - shell conditions @xmath129    ' means a quark gluon vertex @xmath127.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the contribution from the corresponding part in fig.[basic1 ] is : @xmath130    with eq.([vertf ] ) and the on - shell condition eq.([onshell ] ) for the two external fermion legs , we obtain @xmath131 where ` @xmath121 ' means that the factor @xmath120 , the propagator scalar factor and the color factor have been omitted .",
    "the first term is for the basic qed - like diagrams .",
    "the second term @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 will be treated below . the third term ` @xmath124 ' , in fact , does not contribute to the amplitude , no matter whether the gluons are virtual or real .",
    "the proof is that when both the concerned gluons are real , it is easy to show that the remaining terms give zero contribution by using the relation @xmath135 .",
    "when one of the concerned gluons is virtual , the gluon with momentum @xmath65 for example , @xmath136 will always couple to a ` simple ' quark line as @xmath137 at the lowest order for the amplitude of the considered process @xmath7 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the quark and anti - quark spinors , and @xmath140 ( the momenta @xmath141 , @xmath142 satisfy the on - shell condition : @xmath143 , where @xmath123 is the mass of the quark ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the contribution of the remaining terms is zero by using a similar on - shell condition as eq.([onshell ] ) .",
    "therefore , in fig.[basic1 ] and in the following fig.[basic2 ] , the remaining terms have not been shown explicitly .    ' means a quark gluon vertex @xmath127.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in the same way as above , the contribution from the corresponding part in fig.[basic2 ] is : @xmath144 where again the factor @xmath120 , the scalar factor of the propagators and the color factor have been omitted .",
    "the first two terms correspond to the basic qed - like diagrams , and the term which is expressed by @xmath145 is defined as @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a new extra function @xmath148 similarly as for the second structure in eq.(19 ) , the remaining terms in the present structure contribute nothing , thus in fig.[basic2 ] , they have not been shown explicitly .",
    "having made all the preparations above , and performing all the possible interchanges , such as gluon exchange , quark and anti - quark exchange , we relate each of the terms in the diagrams to a combination of those with the basic qed - like diagrams ( ` coordinators ' ) , including the introduced two ` extra ' functions as well .",
    "the @xmath0 meson is a double - heavy weak - binding state . according to pqcd each term of the amplitude for the subprocess",
