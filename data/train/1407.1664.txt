    "complex networks are characterized by a number of general properties , that link together systems of very diverse origin , from nature , society and technology  @xcite .",
    "the feature that has received most attention in the literature is the distribution of the number of neighbors of a node ( degree ) , which is highly skewed , with a tail that can be often well approximated by a power law  @xcite .",
    "such property explains a number of striking characteristics of complex networks , like their high resilience to random failures  @xcite and the very rapid dynamics of diffusion phenomena , like epidemic spreading  @xcite .",
    "the generally accepted mechanism yielding broad degree distributions is preferential attachment  @xcite : in a growing network , new nodes set links with existing nodes with a probability proportional to the degree of the latter . this way the rate of accretion of neighbors will be higher for nodes with more connections , and the final degrees",
    "will be distributed according to a power law .",
    "such basic mechanism , however , taken alone without considering additional growing rules , generates networks with very low values of the clustering coefficient , a relevant feature of real networks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these networks have no community structure  @xcite either .",
    "high clustering coefficients imply a high proportion of triads ( triangles ) in the network .",
    "it has been pointed out that there is a close relationship between a high density of triads and the existence of community structure , especially in social networks , where the density of triads is remarkably high  @xcite . indeed , if we stick to the usual concept of communities as subgraphs with an appreciably higher density of ( internal ) links than in the whole graph",
    ", one would expect that triads are formed more frequently between nodes of the same group , than between nodes of different groups  @xcite .",
    "this concept has been actually used to implement well known community finding methods  @xcite .",
    "foster et al .",
    "@xcite have studied equilibrium graph ensembles obtained by rewiring links of several real networks such to preserve their degree sequences and introduce tunable values of the average clustering coefficient and degree assortativity .",
    "they found that the modularity of the resulting networks is the more pronounced , the larger the value of the clustering coefficient .",
    "correlation , however , does not imply causation , and the work does not provide a dynamic mechanism explaining the emergence of high clustering and community structure .",
    "triadic closure  @xcite is a strong candidate mechanism for the creation of links in networks , especially social networks .",
    "acquaintances are frequently made via intermediate individuals who know both us and the new friends .",
    "besides , such process has the additional advantage of not depending on the features of the nodes that get attached . with preferential attachment ,",
    "it is the node s degree that determine the probability of linking , implying that each new node knows this information about all other nodes , which is not realistic .",
    "instead , triadic closure induces an effective preferential attachment : getting linked to a neighbor @xmath0 of a node corresponds to choosing @xmath0 with a probability increasing with the degree @xmath1 of that node , according to a linear or sublinear preferential attachment .",
    "this principle is at the basis of several generative network models  @xcite , all yielding graphs with fat - tailed degree distributions and high clustering coefficients , as desired .",
    "toivonen et al .",
    "have found that community structure emerges as well  @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a first systematic analysis of models based on triadic closure , and demonstrate that this basic mechanism can indeed endow the resulting graphs with all basic properties of real networks , including a significant community structure .",
    "these models can include or not an explicit preferential attachment , they can be even temporal networks , but as long as triadic closure is included , the networks are sufficiently sparse , and the growth is random , a significant community structure spontaneously emerges in the networks . in fact the nodes of these networks are not assigned any _  a priori \" _ hidden variable that correlates with the community structure of the networks .",
    "we will first discuss a basic model including triadic closure but not an explicit preferential attachment mechanism and we will characterize the community formation and evolution as a function of the main variables of the linking mechanism , i.e.  the relative importance of closing a triad versus random attachment and the average degree of the graph .",
    "we find that communities emerge when there is a high propensity for triadic closure and when the network is sufficiently sparse ( low average degree ) .",
    "we will also consider further models existing in the literature and including triadic closure , and we show that results concerning the emergence of the community structure are qualitatively the same , independently on the presence or not of the explicit preferential attachment mechanism or on the temporal dynamics of the links . finally , we will introduce a variant of the basic model , in which nodes have a fitness and a propensity to attract new links depending on their fitness . here",
    "clusters are less pronounced and , when the fitness distribution is sufficiently skewed , they disappear altogether , while new peculiar aggregations of the nodes emerge , where all nodes of each group are attached to a few superhubs .",
    "we begin with what is possibly the simplest model of network growth based on triadic closure .",

    "when the network is correlated we always find @xmath40 , i.e. the effective link probability is _ sublinear _ in the degree of the target node .",
    "we note however , that the duplication model @xcite , in which every new node is attached to a random node and to each of its neighbor with probability @xmath9 , displays at the same time degree correlations and power - law degree distribution .",
    "we also find that the model spontaneously generates communities during the evolution of the system . to quantify how pronounced communities are",
    ", we use a measure called _ embeddedness _ , which estimates how strongly nodes are attached to their own cluster .",
    "embeddedness , which we shall indicate with @xmath53 , is defined as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the internal and the total degree of community @xmath57 and the sum runs over all @xmath58 communities of the network .",
    "if the community structure is strong , most of the neighbors of each node in a cluster will be nodes of that cluster , so @xmath55 will be close to @xmath56 and @xmath53 turns out to be close to @xmath18 ; if there is no community structure @xmath53 is close to zero .",
    "however , one could still get values of embeddedness which are not too small , even in random graphs , which have no modular structure , as @xmath55 might still be sizeable there . to eliminate such borderline cases ,",
    "we introduce a new variable , the _ node - based embeddedness _ , that we shall indicate with @xmath59 .",
    "it is based on the idea that for a node to be properly assigned to a cluster , it must have more neighbors in that cluster than in any of the others .",
    "this leads to the following definition @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of neighbors of node @xmath5 in its cluster , @xmath62 is the maximum number of neighbors of @xmath5 in any one other cluster and @xmath63 the total degree of @xmath5 .",
    "the sum runs over all @xmath26 nodes of the graph . for a proper community assignment , the difference @xmath64 is expected to be positive , negative if the node is misclassified . in a random graph , and for subgraphs of approximately the same size",

    "results obtained by applying the louvain algorithm  @xcite ( taking the most granular level to avoid artifacts caused by the resolution limit  @xcite ) yield a consistent picture .",
    "all networks are grown until @xmath65 nodes .     and",
    "@xmath4 for the basic model .",
    "community structure ( higher embeddedness and clustering coefficient ) is pronounced in the lower left region when @xmath4 is not too large ( sparse graphs ) and when the probability of triadic closure @xmath9 is very high . for each pair of parameter values",
    "we report the average over @xmath66 network realizations .",
    "the white area in the upper right corresponds to systems where a single community , consisting of the whole network , is found . here",
    "one would get a maximum value @xmath18 for @xmath59 , but it is not meaningful , hence we discard this portion of the phase diagram , as well as in figs . 7 and 8 . ]",
    "we see that large values of @xmath59 are associated to the bottom left portion of the diagram , corresponding to high values of the probability of triadic closure and to low values of degree .",
    "so , a high density of triangles ensures the formation of clusters , provided the network is sufficiently sparse . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we present an analogous heat map for the average clustering coefficient @xmath39 , which is defined  @xcite as @xmath67 where @xmath15 is the element of the adjacency matrix of the graph and @xmath63 is again the degree of node @xmath5 . fig .",
    "[ fig3]b confirms that @xmath39 is the largest when @xmath9 is high and @xmath4 is low , as expected .",
    "the mechanism of formation and evolution of communities is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "when the first denser clumps of the network are formed ( a ) , out of random fluctuations in the density of triangles newly added nodes are more likely to close triads within the protoclusters than between them ( b ) .",
    "as more nodes and links are added , the protoclusters become larger and larger and their internal density of links becomes inhomogenous , so there will be a selective triadic closure within the denser parts , which yields a separation into smaller clusters ( c ) .",
    "this cycle of growing and splitting plays repeatedly along the evolution of the system .     along the growth of the network .",
    "the curves refer to the extreme cases of absence of triadic closure ( lower curve ) , yielding a random graph without communities , and of systematic triadic closure ( upper curve ) , yielding a graph with pronounced community structure . for the latter case ,",
    "we magnify in the inset the initial portion of the curve , to highlight the sudden drops of @xmath59 , indicated by the arrows , which correspond to the breakout of clusters into smaller ones . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the time evolution of the node - based embeddedness @xmath59 during the growth of the system , until @xmath68 nodes are added to the network , @xmath21 .",
    "we consider the two extreme situations @xmath69 , corresponding to the absence of triadic closure and @xmath70 , where both links close a triangle every time and there is no additional noise . in the first case ( green line ) , after a transient , @xmath59 sets to a low value , with small fluctuations ; in the case with pure triadic closure , instead , the equilibrium value is much higher , indicating strong community structure , and fluctuations are modest .",
    "in contrast with the random case , we recognize a characteristic pattern , with @xmath59 increasing steadily and then suddenly dropping .",
    "the smooth increase of @xmath59 signal that the communities are growing , the rapid drop that a cluster splits into smaller pieces : in the inset such breakouts are indicated by arrows .",
    "embeddedness drops when clusters break up because the internal degrees @xmath61 of the nodes of the fragments in eq .",
    "[ xin ] suddenly decrease , since some of the old internal neighbors belong to a different community , while the values of @xmath62 are typically unaffected .",
    "the scenario depicted in section  [ sec1 ] is not limited to the basic model we have investigated , but it is quite general . to show this , we consider here two other models based on triadic closure .",
    "the model by holme and kim  @xcite is a variant of the barabsi - albert model of preferential attachment ( ba model ) which generate scale - free networks with clustering .",
    "the new node joining the network sets a link with an existing node , chosen with a probability proportional to the degree of the latter , just like in the ba model .",
    "the other @xmath19 links coming with the new node , however , are attached with a probability @xmath71 to a random neighbor of the node which received the most recent preferentially - attached link , closing a triangle , and with a probability @xmath72 to another node chosen with preferential attachment . by varying @xmath71 it is possible to tune the level of clustering into the network , while the degree distribution is the same as in the ba model , i.e.  a power law with exponent @xmath73 , for any value of @xmath71 .     and @xmath4 for the model by holme and kim  @xcite .",
    "for each pair of parameter values we report the average over @xmath66 network realizations .",
    "the white area in the upper right corresponds to systems where a single community , consisting of the whole network , is found , which is not interesting .",
    "the diagrams look qualitatively similar to that of the basic model ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , with highest embeddedness and clustering coefficient in the lower left region . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the same heat map as in fig .  [ fig3 ] for this model , where we now report the probability @xmath71 on the y - axis .",
    "networks are again grown until @xmath65 nodes .",
    "the picture is very similar to what we observe for the basic model .    the model by marsili et al .",
    "@xcite , at variance with most models of network formation , is not based on a growth process .",
    "the model is a model for temporal networks @xcite , in which the links are created and destroyed on the fast time scale while the number of nodes remains constant .",
    "the starting point is a random graph with @xmath26 nodes .",
    "then , three processes take place , at different rates :    1 .",
    "any existing link vanishes ( rate @xmath74 ) ; 2 .",
    "a new link is created between a pair of nodes , chosen at random ( rate @xmath75 ) ; 3 .",
    "a triangle is formed by joining a node with a random neighbor of one of his neighbors , chosen at random ( rate @xmath76 ) .    in our simulations",
    "we start from a random network of @xmath65 nodes with average degree @xmath77 .",
    "the three rates @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be reduced to two independent parameters , since what counts is their relative size .",
    "the number of links deleted at each iteration is proportional to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the number of links of the network , while the number of links created via the two other processes is proportional to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the number of links @xmath79 varies in time but in order to get a non - trivial stationary state , one should reach an equilibrium situation where the numbers of deleted and created links match .",
    "a variety of scenarios are possible , depending on the choices of the parameters . for instance , if @xmath76 is set equal to zero , there are no triads , and what one gets at stationarity is a random graph with average degree @xmath82 .",
    "so , if @xmath83 , the graph is fragmented into many small connected components . in one",
    "introduces triadic closure , the clustering coefficient grows with @xmath76 if the network is fragmented , as triangles concentrate in the connected components .",
    "moreover the model can display a veritable first order phase transition and in a region of the phase diagram displays two stable phases : one corresponding to a connected network with large average clustering coefficient and the other one corresponding to a disconnected network .",
    "interestingly , if there is a dense single component , the clustering coefficient decreases with @xmath76 .",
    "the degree distribution can follow different patterns too : it is poissonian in the diluted phase , where the system is fragmented , and broad in the dense phase , where the system consists of a single component with an appreciable density of links . in fig .  [ fig7 ]",
    "we show the analogous heat map as in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig6 ] , for the two parameters @xmath74 and @xmath76 .",
    "the third parameter @xmath84 .",
    "we consider only configurations where the giant component covers more than a half of the nodes of the network .",
    "the diagrams are now different because of the different role of the parameters , but the picture is consistent nevertheless .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath39 is highest when the ratio of @xmath74 and @xmath76 lies within a narrow range , yielding a sparse network with a giant component having a high density of triangles and a corresponding presence of strong communities .     and @xmath76 for the model by marsili et al .",

    "these diagrams have better communities ( higher embeddedness and clustering coefficient ) towards the upper right , different from those in figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig6 ] , because of the different meaning and effect of the parameters .",
    "however , there is a strong correspondence between high clustering coefficient and strong community structure , as in the other models . ]",
    "in this section we introduce a variant of the basic model , where the link attractivity depends on some intrinsic fitness of the nodes .",

    "the situation changes dramatically when @xmath90 starts to increase , as we witness a progressive weakening of community structure , while the clustering coefficient keeps growing , which appears counterintuitive . in the analogous diagrams for @xmath124",
    ", we see that this pattern holds , though with a weaker overall community structure and lower values of the clustering coefficient .     and the heterogeneity parameter @xmath90 of the fitness distribution of the nodes , for the model with fitness .",

    "for each pair of parameter values we report the average over @xmath66 network realizations .",
    "when @xmath93 we recover the basic model , without fitness .",
    "we see the highest values of embeddedness in the lower left , while highest values of the clustering coefficient are in the lower right .",
    "when @xmath90 increases , we see a drastic change of structure in contrast to the previous pattern : communities disappear , whereas the clustering coefficient gets higher . ]    , but for @xmath124 .",
    "the picture is consistent with the case @xmath21 , but communities are less pronounced . ]    when @xmath90 is sufficiently large , communities disappear , despite the high density of triangles . to check what happens",
    ", we compute the probability distribution of the scaled link density @xmath125 and the node - based embeddedness @xmath59 of the communities of the networks obtained from @xmath51 runs of the model , for three different values of @xmath90 : @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "all networks are grown until @xmath129 nodes .",
    "the scaled link density @xmath125 of a cluster is defined  @xcite as @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath58 are the number of internal links and of nodes of cluster @xmath57 .",
    "if the cluster is tree - like , @xmath132 , if it is clique - like it @xmath133 , so it grows linearly with the size of the cluster .",
    "the distributions of @xmath59 and @xmath125 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "they are peaked , but the peaks undergo a rapid shift when @xmath90 goes from @xmath126 to @xmath128 .",
    "the situation resembles what one usually observes in first - order phase transitions .",
    "the embeddedness ends up peaking at low values , quite distant from the maximum @xmath18 , while the scaled link density eventually peaks sharply at @xmath134 , indicating that the subgraphs are effectively tree - like .",
    "what kind of objects are we looking at ? to answer this question , in figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] we display two pictures of networks obtained by the fitness model , for @xmath93 and @xmath135 , respectively .",
    "the number of nodes is @xmath136 , and the number of edges per node @xmath21 .",
    "the probability of triadic closure is @xmath137 , as we want a very favorable scenario for the emergence of structure .",
    "the subgraphs found by our community detection method ( non - hierarchical infomap , but the louvain method yields a similar picture ) are identified by the different colors .",
    "the insets show an enlarged picture of the subgraphs , which clarify the apparent puzzle delivered by the previous diagrams .",
    "for the basic model @xmath93 ( fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) , the subgraphs are indeed communities , as they are cohesive objects which are only loosely connected to the rest of the graph .",
    "the situation remains similar for low values of @xmath90 .",
    "however , for sufficiently high @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) , a phenomenon of link condensation takes place , with a few superhubs attracting most of the links of the network  @xcite .",
    "most of the other nodes are organized in groups which are `` shared '' between pairs ( for @xmath21 , more generally @xmath4-ples ) of superhubs ( see figure ) .",
    "the community embeddedness is low because there are always many links flowing out of the subgraphs , towards superhubs .",
    "besides , since the superhubs are all linked to each other , this generates high clustering coefficient for the subgraphs , as observed in figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] .",
    "in fact , the clustering coefficient for the non - hubs attains the maximum possible value of @xmath18 , as their neighbors are nodes which are all linked to each other .",
    "triadic closure is a fundamental mechanism of link formation , especially in social networks .",
    "we have shown that such mechanism alone is capable to generate systems with all the characteristic properties of complex networks , from fat - tailed degree distributions to high clustering coefficients and strong community structure . in particular",
    ", we have seen that communities emerge naturally via triadic closure , which tend to generate cohesive subgraphs around portions of the system that happen to have higher density of links , due to stochastic fluctuations .",
    "when clusters become sufficiently large , their internal structure exhibits in turn link density inhomogeneities , leading to a progressive differentiation and eventual separation into smaller clusters ( separation in the sense that the density of links between the parts is appreciably lower than within them ) .",
    "this occurs both in the basic version of network growth model based on triadic closure , and in more complex variants .",
    "the strength of community structure is the higher , the sparser the network and the higher the probability of triadic closure .",
    "we have also introduced a new variant , in that link attractivity depends on some intrinsic appeal of the nodes , or fitness . here we have seen that , when the distribution of fitness is not too heterogeneous , community structure still emerges , though it is weaker than in the absence of fitness . by increasing the heterogeneity of the fitness distribution , instead , we observe a major change in the structural organization of the network : communities disappear and are replaced by special subgraphs , whose nodes are connected only to superhubs of the network , i.e.  nodes attracting most of the links .",
    "such structural phase transition is associated to very high values of the clustering coefficient ."
