    "the form of the quark equation of state chosen between the radial pressure and the energy density is linear .",
    "this new class of solutions to the einstein - maxwell system of equations obtained in this work is physically reasonable in an astrophysical context and serves to model relativistic stars .",
    "we have demonstrated this by graphically analysing the matter variables , and also generating various tables for the mass function for different values of the parameters in the electric field .",
    "our general class of solutions contain the earlier models of mafa takisa and maharaj @xcite and thirukkanesh and maharaj @xcite in the presence of charge .",
    "the models of dey et al .",
    "@xcite and sharma and maharaj @xcite are regained in the appropriate limit for vanishing charge .",
    "the stellar masses generated are consistent with earlier investigations and we regain the stellar mass of the object sax j@xmath138 as @xmath139 .",
    "our new family of solutions solutions is a further indication of the richness of the einstein - maxwell system of equations and their link to astrophysical applications ; we studied the physical features and plotted the matter and electrical variables . a comparative table of masses for uncharged and charged matter was established which corresponds to observed astronomical objects .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 does not appear to appreciably change the mass for the parameter values chosen but a different set of parameters can give a different profile for the mass .",
