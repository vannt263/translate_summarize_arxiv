    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the velocity components .",
    "@xmath19 is the gas pressure .    with a baric equation of state @xmath20 ,",
    "relating density , @xmath0 , pressure , @xmath19 , and internal energy @xmath15 ( using the polytropic index @xmath21 ) , the system can be closed . when the temperature is required , such as when cooling is used , a caloric equation of state , @xmath22 is invoked , using , @xmath23 , the mean molecular weight .",
    "this system has been solved on a grid of cells by considering the cell average values and the flow , or fluxes , between cells .",
    "the methods used have often been founded on the solution of the riemann problem , a simple non - linear interaction between two adjacent regions of ideal gasses , as first outlined by godunov in the 1950s , @xcite , and @xcite in the 1960s .    with the formation of shockwaves in a computed flow , a fundamental problem arises where high order methods inevitably lead to non - physical oscillations of the flow properties in cells near a discontinuity , and the pioneering work of godunov showed , in the godunov theorem , that no monotonic shock capturing method could be higher than first order accuracy .",
    "since then , the development of hybrid high order methods that give rapid convergence in smooth flows , while also computing locally first order treatments of shock discontinuities , have been the goal of many .",
    "the first practical methods to localise and manage godunov s theorem were developed in a series of papers by van leer in the 1970s ( @xcite ) .",
    "godunov s method of solving the riemann gas problem was combined with the development of adaptive piecewise grid reconstructions , were the order of interpolation was reduced in the vicinity of shock discontinuities , but allowed to be higher than first order in areas of smooth flow .",
    "conservative fluxes were computed from the solution of inter ",
    "cell riemann problems and used to update the cell quantities .",
    "a key development in 1984 as the use of a conservative 4th order integral polynomial intercell boundary reconstruction , which resulted in the widely used ppm , piecewise parabolic method of collella & woodward ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ppm method is extremely efficient for the order of accuracy achieved , up to 3rd order in spatial reconstruction in smooth flows on a regular grid .",
    "apart from higher order inter  cell reconstruction , work progressed on solving the non - linear riemann problem more quickly , which was especially slow before hardware support for transcendental functions became widespread .",
    "one approach was to linearise the riemann problem , where an approximate riemann problem is solved exactly  resulting in the roe ",
    "pike approximate solvers in the mid 1980s ( see for example @xcite ) , which became very widely used .",
    "other less common approaches included simplifying the iterations when solving the full non - linear problem , giving approximate solutions to the exact riemann problem @xcite .",
    "full , exact solvers of the full non - linear riemann problem were generally abandoned .    in the 1980s",
    "the issues surrounding the control of ` post - shock ' ringing , or generally non - monotonic behaviour of any method higher than first order were explored and refined with the development of tvd ( total variation diminishing ) @xcite and later eno / weno ( essentially non - oscillating and weighted essentially non - oscillating ) methods @xcite .",
    "the ppm method continues to be effective , despite its somewhat ad - hoc monotonicity constraints compared to the more formal tvd flux limiting methods , due to it s great speed and high order interpolation which  has a particularly simple form on a regular grid due to exploited symmetries in the polynomial construction .    since the 1990s ,",
    "interest in the astrophysical regime has been to extend the microphysics ( cooling , dust , ionisation , magnetic fields etc ) and there are a large number of cfd codes targeting different aspects of astrophysical fluids . with this diversity of applications ,",
    "the key issues have become similarly diverse , and applying a single code to all problems is not practical . here",
    "a new code has been developed , to provide a means of computing astrophysical flow problems with more sophisticated microphysics than previous codes , aimed at providing more reliable observational quantities from the simulations , such as h@xmath24 surface brightness , for example .    in this work",
    ", we present the astrophysical hydrodynamics code , _ fyris alpha _ , with a focus on those aspects which have been developed specifically for the new code , along with a comprehensive suite of existing and new test problems to verify the new code .",
    "verification by such test suites is essential , as has been well described in the lenska & wendroff review @xcite , hereafter lw03 , where they showed that even well established codes can have particular weaknesses that are not apparent from a simple description of their algorithms .",
    "lw03 presented a set of 1d and 2d test problems , many with known analytical solutions , and derived robust l1-norm measures of the deviations from the known solutions , providing an objective measure of the complete code performance . here",
    "we apply the lw03 tests to _ fyris alpha _ , and present additional 2d and 3d tests to cover aspects either not fully covered in lw03 , or not covered at all . in particular there is a need for analytical 3d test problems for testing code , as large scale 3d simulations are becoming widely used .",
    "paper ii will cover the non - fluid dynamics aspects of the code , such the time - dependent ionisation , along with aspects of the magneto - hydrodynamic treatment , in the code _ fyris beta_.",
    "_ fyris alpha _  uses a new iterative riemann solver , that is significantly faster than previously used solvers , and even out performs many non - iterative and linearised solvers .",
    "it allows for a variable equation of state through a generalised polytropic index , @xmath21 .",
    "the grid and cell reconstruction uses the ppm method ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , extensive use of methods to deal with and control floating point representations and ` grid  noise ' enable optimisations that make the code up 4  10 times faster than a similar ppm code without the active floating point noise control ( afpnc ) and older riemann solvers .",
    "this additional performance allows for the incorporation of more detailed microphysics , and the computation of larger simulations .",
    "the current implementation uses single and nested refined meshes , and although the capability for creating and destroying zones and subzones is present , fully adaptive mesh operation ( amr ) is not yet implemented and the criterium functions for determining their creation are not developed .",
    "amr is planned for a future version .",
    "extensions including time - dependent ionisation , variable equation of state and molecular cooling , magnetic fields and relativistic treatments are in development and will be presented in later works .",
    "_ fyris alpha",
    "_  is a successor to previous high resolution shock capturing hydrodynamics codes which arose from the original works by @xcite and @xcite on the ppm algorithm , and more recently on codes such as vh1 , @xcite and _ ppmlr _ , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the _ fyris alpha _",
    "code was written to address some of the shortcomings of the older fortran _ ppmlr _ code , particularly in the areas of : a redesign to allow for more general refined meshes @xcite , plus significant code improvement and performance increases to allow more microphysics to be incorporated , and to a lesser extent allow for more ease in modifying and extending the code in the future .    to address these aims ,",
    "the lower level ` c ' language was chosen .",
    "it offers comparable high performance ( albeit with more work from the writer ) , a great deal more flexibility than fortran , portability across many platforms , and access to a range of existing utility code and open source standards that made the simulation support ( i / o , timing etc . ) easier to build .",
    "the code is conceptually made up of an overarching framework , called _ zls _ ( zone  level system ) , which provides all the standard services needed for any simulation , plus provision for modules of specific algorithm code . _ fyris alpha _  is the first of these modules , and it encapsulates the split sweep semi ",
    "lagrangian remap ppm method used by _",
    "ppmlr _ with a number of improvements that have allowed the addition of new micro  physics needed in multi - phase simulations .",
    "future modules are in development .",
    "a website for the code , including validation suites and user information , will be available soon .",
    "_ fyris alpha _  uses an iterative riemann solver in a high order lagrangian godunov scheme to integrate the ideal eulerian hydrodynamic system .",
    "following earlier shock capturing methods , a riemann solver is used to compute the states at the boundaries between cells on a grid and the solutions are used to update the grid .",
    "the cells are defined in a standard conservative way , using the coordinates of the left and right boundaries cell @xmath25and the average variable value @xmath26 in the cell . with a sequence of cells , the ppm algorithm uses the integral of the cells to interpolate and fit parabolae to each cell that preserve the integrals , and hence the average cell values . with the parabolae ,",
    "the cell boundary left and right states are estimated by averaging the parabola over a domain determined by the strength of the cell ",
    "cell interaction .",
    "_ fyris alpha _  uses the maximum of the flow speed and the sound speeds in the cells to determine these domains .",
    "the riemann solver computes the speed of the contact discontinuity ( @xmath27 ) and the pressure in that region ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the cell boundaries are updated to follow this velocity over the time step , an in addition @xmath28 and @xmath27 are used to compute the energy and momentum fluxes from the boundary due to the riemann waves .",
    "after the modified cells are updated , the boundaries are remapped back to their original positions .",
    "the grid is swept in 2d in a cyclic order order , and over two time steps is , @xmath29 , akin to the second order strang splitting , ( @xcite ) , of xdt y2dt xdt . in 3d",
    "the sweep order is permuted : @xmath30 in order to cycle through orthogonal starting sweeps in each sub  cycle .",
    "finally , the split semi ",
    "lagrangian method , as opposed to an unsplit fixed grid eulerian method , has some benefits and drawbacks .",
    "firstly , it is very memory efficient , not requiring the large number of flux arrays of the unsplit methods .",
    "secondly , owing to additional numerical dissipation in the remapping step , the order of accuracy is diminished a little . in 2d advection tests",
    ", fyris achieves a resolution convergence order of 2.4 , ( like vh1 and _ ppmlr _ ) , rather than the full 3rd order seen in an eulerian ppm method .",
    "the greatly reduced memory requirements however tend to balance out this shortfall in 3d models , where larger grids are feasible with the split semi ",
    "lagrangian method .",
    "the algorithm simplicity of the split semi ",
    "lagrangian method also has performance benefits , and overall the _ fyris _ code performs very well in the liska & wendroff tests @xcite as shown in later sections .",
    "the intrinsic asymmetry of the split sweep method can be overcome with more complex symmetric forms of splitting that are used when absolute symmetry preservation are needed .",
    "note that the _ zls _ framework is not tied to a lagrangian method , and is used in the development of eulerian and unsplit mhd algorithms as well .",
    "ppm , vh1 and _ ppmlr _ all used an approximate iterative riemann solver ( hereafter called _ cw84 _ ) . from inspection of the code",
    "it appears to be based on the exact solver of van leer , @xcite .",
    "however it had been simplified in logic to assume that both branches of the riemann problem were shocks , which is exact in the most critical cases , and conservative in general .",
    "note that despite the approximate solver form , the resulting multi ",
    "cell riemann grid calculations produce results that converge on the exact global result .",
    "the benefit is that by removing the boolean branch logic code from the iteration loop , significant speed improvements were obtained .",
    "_ fyris alpha _  has been designed to accept a range of riemann solvers ( each identified by a short _ codename _ ) , and all the solvers of a given system of equations ( hydrodynamics here ) use a standard interface , making interchange a simple matter .",
    "in addition to _ cw84 _ , we have the solver from @xcite : _ toro99 _",
    ", which is exact , albeit relatively slow .",
    "we also have : the toro hybrid solver , _ airs _ , a two shock only version of the _ toro99 _",
    "iterator , _ tss99 _ , and a non - iterative primitive variable approximate solver , _ pvrs _ , also from @xcite .",
    "apart from the very fast _ pvrs _ solver , the solvers from @xcite are generally slower than others , but are retained for cross - checking and teaching purposes ( they are well documented and clear ) .    the main riemann solver used by _",
    "fyris alpha _",
    "is based on the solver of @xcite .",
    "this solver was published there as part of a review of exact solvers after development of approximate solvers of the roe ",
    "pike variety began to dominate , and as such is probably the last fast exact solver developed .",
    "it differs from the van leer type , in that it iterates on the velocity of the star region , rather than the pressure .",
    "this simplifies some of the transcendental functions required , increasing the speed , with a minor degree of complexity added due to the possibility of zero and differing signs in the velocity compared to the positive definite nature of the pressure .",
    "_ fyris alpha _  can use the exact solver of gottlieb & groth , _",
    "gg88 _ , or more commonly , a two - shock version , where we followed the colella & woodward example in simplifying the van leer solver , and applied that to the _ gg88 _ solver .",
    "the resulting solver , _ rss06 _ , is an iterative two shock solver that iterates on @xmath27 , and is on average about twice as fast as the _ cw84 _ solver , but returns essentially identical results , making it an ideal substitute .",
    "it has been shown , for example in @xcite , that two shock iterative solvers are very stable in the presence of extremely strong shocks , and in astrophysical applications this is an essential property , and as seen in the strong shock tests in subsequent sections , _",
    "rss06 _ has proven to be robust and accurate as well as being very fast .    with all iterative solvers ,",
    "reducing the number of iterations is critical to performance . to this end _",
    "_  allows for a range of initial guess options for the solver . in many cases where most of the grid is moving uniformly supersonically , an initial guess for @xmath27 of a simple average of the left and right values works very well . in cases where initial velocities are mostly zero initially a more complex guess based on a single call to the__pvrs _ _ solver works better .",
    "if there are concerns ( such as when very strong rarefaction waves are present ) a simulation can be run with two different solvers as a test , usually using _",
    "rss06 _ or _",
    "cw84_. when _ gg88 _ or _ toro99",
    "_ are used , dissipation settings generally need some adjustment otherwise stronger post - shock ringing effects increase .",
    "the solution of the riemann problem reduces to determining the conditions in the so - called star region , between a set of outwardly propagating waves .",
    "these waves are usually either shock waves or rarefaction waves .",
    "less commonly a vacuum solution can also arise .    with a full non - linear riemann solver",
    "there are different solution branches , depending on the wave type that is expected to form from the interaction of interest .",
    "the two important wave types are a shock or a rarefaction fan .",
    "an exact solver requires internal logic to select the branch of interest and the iterations to solve the problem differ in these two cases .",
    "an approximate two shock solver presumes that the two waves on either side of the star region are always shockwaves , enabling some complex logic calculations to be omitted .",
    "the solution in the shock case is iterative , while there is an analytical answer to the rarefaction case .",
    "use of the non - iterative rarefaction case has been used @xcite to develop fast non - iterative solvers .",
    "however , the shock case , with iterations , is used here because of the numerical robustness of the two shock solver in the presence of very strong shocks .",
    "the _ gg88 _",
    "solver , of @xcite and the _",
