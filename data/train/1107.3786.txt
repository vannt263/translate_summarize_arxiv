    "quantum systems are powerful yet fragile carriers of information .",
    "the ability to create and manipulate superposition states offers verifiably secure cryptography @xcite , reduces the complexity of certain computational problems @xcite , and enables novel communication protocols @xcite .",
    "however , in practical settings one needs to protect the quantum states carrying information against decoherence , i.e.  uncontrolled interactions with the environment .",
    "this is accomplished by building redundancy into the physical implementation .",
    "compared to the classical case , this task is much more challenging @xcite due to limitations in handling quantum information , exemplified boldly by the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "when an ensemble of elementary quantum systems decoheres through symmetric coupling with the environment , one can identify collective states that remain invariant in the course of evolution .",
    "these states span a so - called _ decoherence - free subspace _ ( dfs ) that is effectively decoupled from the interaction with the environment @xcite . more generally , it is possible to identify subspaces that can be formally decomposed into a tensor product of two subsystems , one of which `` absorbs '' decoherence , while the second one , named a _ noiseless subsystem _ or _ a decoherence - free subsystem _ , remains intact @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the dfs for an ensemble of @xmath1 qudits , i.e.  elementary @xmath0-level systems , composed of states @xmath2 that are invariant with respect to an arbitrary perfectly correlated su@xmath3 transformation : @xmath4 we show that this dfs features an additional degree of robustness , namely that the stored quantum information is immune to the loss of one of the qudits , regardless of the encoding .",
    "this result , specialized to the polarization state of single photons for which @xmath5 , offers _ combined _ protection against two common optical decoherence mechanisms : photon loss @xcite due to reflections , scattering , residual absorption , etc .  as well as collective depolarization that occurs inevitably in optical fibers used for long - haul transmission @xcite .",
    "consequently , we provide here rigorous foundations to a speculation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite that dfs - based quantum cryptography can be made tolerant also to photon loss .",
    "it is worth noting that another physical realization of the qubit case can be also an ensemble of spin-@xmath6 particles @xcite coupled identically to a varying magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : singletqubits ]",
    "we briefly review the geometry of the singlet subspace for an ensemble of qubits and we explicitly show the robustness of the four qubit dfs , which spans the logical qubit space .",
    "this particular case leads us to a proposal for a proof - of - principle experiment based on currently available photonic technologies that demonstrates the robustness of dfs encoding , presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimentalscheme ] .",
    "the general proof for an arbitrary @xmath0 that a quantum superposition encoded in an @xmath7 dfs remains immune against the loss of one particle is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "because of two relevant physical realizations using photons and spin-@xmath8 particles , we will first discuss the qubit case with @xmath5 .",
    "the complete hilbert space of an ensemble of @xmath1 qubits , each described by a two - dimensional spin-@xmath8 space @xmath9 , can be subjected to clebsch - gordan decomposition @xcite @xmath10 where the direct sum is taken with the step of one and @xmath11 are multiplicities of spin-@xmath12 hilbert spaces @xmath13 , given explicitly by @xmath14 the action of @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is any @xmath17 transformation , affects only @xmath13 in eq .",

    "the _ singlet subspace _ corresponding to @xmath19 is free from decoherence .",
    "furthermore , removing one particle from that ensemble maps any initial state from the singlet subspace onto a certain state from the _ doublet subspace _ @xmath20 . because @xmath21 , it is plausible that the quantum superposition will end up entirely in the decoherence - free subsystem @xmath22 where it will remain protected from collective depolarization .",

    "the simplest non - trivial case is @xmath26 physical qubits encoding one logical qubit .",
    "let us consider three states from the four - qubit dfs defined as products @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the singlet state of qubits @xmath29 and @xmath12 .",
    "these states , shown schematically in fig .  [ fig : spps ] , form an overcomplete set in the dfs . for concreteness ,",
    "let us select @xmath23 and @xmath25 as a non - orthogonal basis .",
    "any state of the logical dfs qubit can be written as a superposition @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are complex amplitudes . without loss of generality we can assume that the first physical qubit has been lost .",
    "the remaining three qubits are described by an equally weighted statistical mixture of two states : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the state of all qubits but the first one .",
    "it is easy to see that a collective transformation @xmath35 leaves the statistical mixture @xmath36 intact .    after the loss of the first particle , the initial four - qubit state from eq .",
    "( [ eq : psifourqubit ] ) can be recovered through the following procedure .",
    "first , one needs to measure in a non - destructive way the @xmath37 component of the total pseudospin operator @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , in order to discriminate @xmath40 from @xmath41 .",
    "if the result corresponding to @xmath41 is obtained , we apply a collective rotation @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "this yields the state @xmath44 . in the second step ,",
    "one replaces the lost qubit with a new one prepared in a state @xmath45 and applies a controlled rotation which restores the original state @xmath2 : @xmath46 note that this rotation can be realized as a sequence of three c - not gates .",
    "the robustness of dfs to particle loss can be intuitively understood in the following way .",
    "dfs states owe their invariance with respect to collective unitary transformation to a very rigid structure .",
    "in fact , if we write a dfs state as a superposition in the computational basis for individual qubits , the state of one qubit can be determined unambiguously from the states of the remaining ones .",
    "this suggests that the loss of one particle does not destroy any information .",
    "futher , it is always possible to repair the state as there is only one unique way to fit the lost particle such that the singlet symmetry is recovered .",
    "we will now present a proposal a feasible experiment that demonstrates the robustness of dfs encoding using photon quadruplets that can be generated in the process of parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "the basis states @xmath47 and @xmath48 correspond in this case to horizontal and vertical polarizations of individual photons .",
    "let us consider four - photon states @xmath49 , @xmath50 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfs4 ] ) as well as their orthogonal complements in the two - dimensional dfs , which we will denote as @xmath51 . the index @xmath52 corresponds to three non - equivalent orderings of the photons and it can be changed by suitable rerouting of the photons .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , the states @xmath23 and @xmath53 can be discriminated unambiguously by detecting polarizations in the horizontal - vertical basis @xmath54 for photons @xmath55 and in the diagonal basis @xmath56 for photons @xmath57 . restricted to the dfs subspace , this strategy yields the standard projective measurement .",
    "it is easy to check that the above individual measurement no longer works if one of the photons is missing .",
    "it turns out that this problem can be solved by resorting to collective measurements .",
    "suppose that we interfere photon pairs @xmath55 and @xmath57 on two separate balanced beam splitters , playing the role linear - optics bell state analyzers @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath23 will yield exactly one photon in each output port of each beam splitter .",
    "in contrast , because the orthogonal state @xmath53 can be written as @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , it will always produce two photons at the same output port for each of the two beam splitters .",
    "if one photon is lost , the states @xmath23 and @xmath53 will still give distinguishable outcomes : registering two photons at a single output unambiguously heralds @xmath53 , while registering a photon pair at two different outputs of the same beam splitters detects @xmath23 .",
    "the third photon will emerge separately from the second beam splitter .",
    "this detection scheme is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : measurement ] .",
    "an interesting question is whether the scheme described above could be exploited for quantum key distribution .",
    "the scalar products between any two the states @xmath49 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 are equal to @xmath62 . in the bloch representation of the two - dimensional dfs , they form a regular triangle inscribed into a great circle on the bloch sphere , constituting a so - called _ trine _ that warrants cryptographic security @xcite . to generate a key ,",
    "the sender alice could prepare photon quadruplets in one of randomly selected states @xmath23 , @xmath24 , or @xmath25 .",
    "the ability to perform a projection onto any pair of orthogonal states @xmath63 would enable the receiving party bob to tell , in the case when an outcome @xmath51 is obtained , which state has definitely not been prepared by alice",
    ". such correlations between alice s preparations and bob s outcomes can be distilled into a secure key .",
    "we have shown that the projective measurement onto @xmath63 can be implemented in a way that tolerates the loss of one photon . in a cryptographic setting ,",
    "the crucial issue is to ensure that an eavesdropper eve does does not map the state of intercepted photons outside the dfs , which may enable eavesdropping attacks beyond those already studied @xcite . to verify that this is not the case",
    ", bob could perform in principle a full quantum state reconstruction on some of the transmissions , which however would be resource consuming .",
    "we conjecture that a sufficient strategy to detect such an attack would be : ( i ) to detect polarizations of photons emerging after the beam splitters ; ( ii ) for a subset of transmissions to count directly received photons to ensure that no multiphoton states in individual input paths occur ; ( iii ) for another subset of transmissions to apply before the beam splitters random and uncorrelated transformations @xmath64 and @xmath65 and check that states @xmath49 always yield the correct outcome when bob used the matching basis for his measurement .",

    "the reasoning presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : singletqubits ] can be generalized to any even number of @xmath66 qubits by considering dfs states given by products of two - qubit singlet states .",
    "such states form an overcomplete set in the dfs @xcite , which enables one to follow directly the steps described for four qubits .",
    "the robustness of dfs encoding can be shown more generally for an ensemble of @xmath1 qudits , i.e.  @xmath0-dimensional systems . in this case , a dfs satisfying eq .",

    "consequently , projecting the first qudit on orthogonal states @xmath85 and @xmath86 leaves the remaining qudits in distinguishable states .    in order to verify the case",
    "when @xmath87 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sud : dmuidmuj ] ) it is convenient to use the transformation of states @xmath88 under the action of @xmath89 . in order to derive this transformation ,",
    "let us rewrite the invariance condition from eq .   to the form @xmath90 and",
    "project the first qudit onto @xmath91 .",
    "this yields the identity : @xmath92 let us now specialize this result to a special unitary transformation that cyclically shifts the labelling of the basis states : @xmath93 where the addition @xmath94 is understood to be modulo @xmath0 . using this @xmath95 in eq .",
    "implies that @xmath96 , i.e.  @xmath97 and @xmath98 are related by a unitary that is independent of @xmath2 .",

    "( [ eq : sud : dmuidmuj ] ) implies that analogously to the su(2 ) case the components with different @xmath29 occupy orthogonal subspaces . within each subspace",
    "the state is fully preserved , which follows from applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : sud : dmuidmuj ] ) to pairs of states from an arbitrary basis in the dfs .",
    "the final step is to show that the state @xmath102 is invariant with respect to @xmath89 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that both the initial state @xmath2 and the procedure of tracing out a particle are invariant with respect to su(@xmath0 ) transformations .",
    "explicitly , the invariance of @xmath102 can be verified with a calculation based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : iudagger ] ) : @xmath103 thus the encoded state is fully preserved .",
    "concluding , we have shown that dfs encoding is immune to removing one particle .",
    "unfortunately , this property does not seem to generalize in a straightforward manner to the loss of more particles .",
    "for example , when two qubits are removed from a four - qubit dfs state , the result will be either a singlet state of the remaining two qubits , or a statistical mixture of the singlet and triplet states which does not preserve the original superposition .",
    "this observation holds also for any higher even number of qubits .",
    "nevertheless , our result shows how to protect information in the few - photon regime from both collective depolarization and the first - order effects of linear attenuation .",
    "we have proposed an experimental demonstration of this combined protection which can provide a robust quantum cryptography protocol .    finally , let us note that although the proof of robustness against the qudit loss was based on the assumption that eq .",
    "( [ eq : invariance ] ) is satisfied for every @xmath7 matrix , the dfs fulfilling this condition protects quantum superpositions from any decoherence mechanism that involves a subset of @xmath7 transformations . therefore our considerations apply to a range of physical systems , for example higher - spin particles in a magnetic field or multilevel atoms interacting with optical fields .",
