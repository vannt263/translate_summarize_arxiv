    "a number of recent observations suggest that the ratio of the baryonic ( plus dark ) matter density to the critical density , @xmath5 , is significantly less than unity , being of the order of @xmath60.3 ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , recent measurements of the position of the first acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum of cmbr anisotropies , by boomerang-98 and maxima - i experiments , seem to provide strong evidence that the corresponding ratio for the total density to the critical density , @xmath0 , is close to one  @xcite    @xcite . added to this",
    "is the evidence from the spectral and photometric observations of type ia supernovae  @xcite which seem to suggest that the universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion at the present epoch  @xcite .",
    "this rather diverse set of observations has led to an evolving consensus among cosmologists that the total density of the universe , @xmath0 , is likely to be very close to unity , a significant part of which resides in the form of a dark component which is smooth on cosmological scales and which possesses negative pressure . a candidate that satisfies these criteria",
    "is the vacuum energy corresponding to a cosmological constant .",
    "somewhat parallel to these developments , and to some extent unrelated to them , a great deal of work has also recently gone into studying the possibility that the universe may possess compact spatial sections with a non - trivial topology ( see , for example ,  @xcite  ",
    "@xcite ) , including the construction of different topological indicators ( see e.g.  @xcite    @xcite ) .",
    "a fair number of these studies have concentrated on cases where the densities corresponding to matter and vacuum energy are substantially smaller than the critical density .",
    "this was reasonable because until very recently observations used to point to a low density universe .",
    "in addition an important aim of most of these previous works has often been to produce examples where the topology of the universe has strong observational signals and can therefore be detected and even determined .",
    "the main aims of this paper , which are complementary to these earlier works , are twofold .",
    "firstly , to study the question of detectability of a possible non - trivial compact topology in locally homogeneous and isotropic universes whose total density parameter is taken to be close to one ( @xmath1 ) . secondly , to show how given a non - zero lower bound on @xmath7 , we can exclude certain families of compact manifolds as viable candidates for the shape of the universe .",
    "we shall do this by employing two indicators , namely the ratios of the so called _ injectivity radius _",
    "( @xmath8 ) , and _ maximal inradius _ ( @xmath9 ) to the depth @xmath10 of given catalogues .",
    "we study almost flat models with both @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and our results apply to any method of detection of topology based on observations of multiple images of either cosmic objects or spots of microwave background radiation .",
    "we note that even though the idea that non - trivial topologies become harder to detect as @xmath2 is implicitly present in some other works  @xcite , it has , however , often been passed over as an uninteresting limit concerning non - trivial topologies , given the observations at the time . here , in addition to studying this limit in detail by considering concrete families of manifolds ( topologies ) , rather than individual examples as has often been done before , we treat it as the most relevant limit concerning the geometry of the universe today in view of the recent observations  @xcite    @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ cosset ]",
    "we give an account of the cosmological models employed .",
    "section  [ top ] contains a brief account of our topological setting .",
    "in section  [ dettop ] we discuss the question of detectability of cosmic topology using a number of indicators .",
    "section  [ almostflat ] contains a detailed discussion of the question of detection of cosmic topology in universes with @xmath13 , with the help of concrete examples , and finally section  [ concl ] contains summary of our main results and conclusions .",
    "let us begin by assuming that the universe is modelled by a @xmath14-manifold @xmath15 which allows a @xmath16 splitting , @xmath17 , with a locally isotropic and homogeneous friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric [ flrw1 ] ds^2 = -c^2dt^2 + r^2 ( t ) , where @xmath18 is a cosmic time , the function @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 @xmath21 or @xmath22 depending on the sign of the constant spatial curvature ( @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 is the scale factor .",
    "furthermore , we shall assume throughout this article that the @xmath25-space @xmath26 is a multiply connected compact quotient manifold of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a discrete group of isometries of @xmath29 acting freely on the covering space @xmath29 of @xmath26 , where @xmath29 can take one of the forms @xmath30 or @xmath31 [ corresponding , respectively , to flat ( @xmath32 ) , elliptic ( @xmath33 ) and hyperbolic ( @xmath34 ) spaces ] .",
    "the group @xmath28 is called the covering group of @xmath26 , and is isomorphic to its fundamental group @xmath35 .    for non - flat models ( @xmath36 ) , the scale factor @xmath24 is identified with the curvature radius of the spatial section of the universe at time @xmath18 , and thus @xmath37 can be interpreted as the distance of any point with coordinates @xmath38 to the origin of coordinates ( in @xmath29 ) , in units of curvature radius , which is a natural unit of length and suitable for measuring areas and volumes . throughout this paper",
    "we shall use this natural unit .    in the light of current observations ,",
    "we assume the current matter content of the universe to be well approximated by dust ( of density @xmath39 ) plus a cosmological constant @xmath40 . the friedmann equation is then given by h^2 = - + , where @xmath41 is the hubble parameter and @xmath42 is the newton s constant , which upon introducing @xmath43 and @xmath44 and letting @xmath45 , it can be rewritten as [ r - eq ] r^2 = .    for universe models having compact spatial sections with non - trivial topology , which",
    "we shall be concerned with in this article , it is clear that any attempt at the discovery of such a topology through observations must start with the comparison of the curvature radius and the horizon radius ( distance ) @xmath46 at the present time . to calculate the latter ,",
    "we recall the redshift - distance relation in the above flrw settings can be written in the form @xmath47^{-1/2 } dx \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the index @xmath48 denotes evaluation at present time .",
    "the horizon radius @xmath46 is then defined as @xmath49 which , by using ( [ r - eq ] ) evaluated at the present time , can be expressed in units of the curvature radius in the form @xmath50^{-1/2 } dx \\ ; .\\ ] ]    we note that in practice there are basically three types of catalogues which can be used in order to search for repeated patterns in the universe and hence the nature of the cosmic topology : namely , clusters of galaxies , containing clusters with redshifts of up to @xmath51 ; active galactic nuclei ( mainly qso s and quasars ) , with a redshift cut - off of @xmath52 ; and the cmbr from the decoupling epoch with a redshift of @xmath53 .",
    "it is expected that future catalogues will increase the first two cut - offs to @xmath54  @xcite and @xmath55 ( by 2005  @xcite ) respectively .",
    "thus , instead of @xmath56 ( for which @xmath57 ) it is observationally more appropriate to consider the largest distance @xmath58 explored by a given astronomical survey .",
    "let us start by recalling that , contrary to the hyperbolic and elliptic cases , there is no natural unit of length for the euclidean geometry , since in this case the curvature radius is infinite . also , it is unlikely that astrophysical observations can fix the density parameter @xmath0 to be exactly equal to one .",
    "therefore , in this section we shall confine ourselves to nearly flat hyperbolic and spherical spaces and briefly consider some relevant facts about manifolds with constant non - zero curvature , which will be used in the following sections .",
    "regarding the hyperbolic case , there is at present no complete classification of these manifolds .",
    "a number of important results are , however , known about them , including the two important theorems of mostow  @xcite ( see also prasad  @xcite ) and thurston  @xcite . according to the former ,",
    "geometrical quantities of orientable hyperbolic manifolds , such as their ( finite ) volumes and the lengths of their closed geodesics , are topological invariants .",
    "moreover , it turns out that there are only a finite number of compact hyperbolic manifolds with the same volume . according to the latter",
    ", there is a countable infinity of sequences of compact orientable hyperbolic manifolds , with the manifolds of each sequence being ordered in terms of their volumes  @xcite .",
    "moreover there exists a hyperbolic 3-manifold with a minimum volume  @xcite , whose volume is shown to be greater than 0.28151  @xcite .",
    "hyperbolic manifolds can be easily constructed and studied with the publicly available software package snappea  @xcite ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this way , hodgson and weeks",
    "have compiled a census of 11031 closed hyperbolic manifolds , ordered by increasing volumes ( see  @xcite ) . as examples ,",
    "we show in table  [ tb : hw - census ] the first 10 manifolds from this census with the lowest volumes , together with their volumes , as well as the lengths @xmath59 of their smallest closed geodesics and their inradii @xmath60 , which are discussed below .",
    "the first two entries ( rows ) of table  [ tb : hw - census ] are known as weeks and thurston s manifolds respectively , with the former conjectured to be the smallest ( minimum volume ) closed hyperbolic manifold .    * 4|c| @xmath26 & @xmath61 & @xmath59 & @xmath62 + m003(-3,1 ) & 0.942707 & 0.584604 & 0.519162 + m003(-2,3 ) & 0.981369 & 0.578082 & 0.535437 + m007(3,1 ) & 1.014942 & 0.831443 & 0.527644 + m003(-4,3 ) & 1.263709 & 0.575079 & 0.550153 + m004(6,1 ) & 1.284485 & 0.480312 & 0.533500 + m004(1,2 ) & 1.398509 & 0.366131 & 0.548345 + m009(4,1 ) & 1.414061 & 0.794135 & 0.558355 + m003(-3,4 ) & 1.414061 & 0.364895 & 0.562005 + m003(-4,1 ) & 1.423612 & 0.352372 & 0.535631 + m004(3,2 ) & 1.440699 & 0.361522 & 0.556475 +    regarding the spherical manifolds , we recall that the isometry group of the @xmath25-sphere is @xmath63",
    ". however , since any isometry of @xmath64 that has no fixed points is orientation - preserving , to construct multiply connected spherical manifolds it is sufficient to consider the subgroups of @xmath65 , because for these subgroups the orientation is necessarily preserved .",
    "thus any spherical 3-manifold of positive constant curvature is of the form @xmath66 , where @xmath28 is a finite subgroup of @xmath65 acting freely on the @xmath25-sphere . the classification of spherical @xmath25-dimensional manifolds is well known and can be found , for instance in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a description in the context of cosmic topology ) . in the remainder of this section we shall focus our attention on the important subset of such spaces , referred to as _ lens spaces _ , in order to examine the question of detectability of cosmic topology of nearly flat spherical universes .",
    "briefly , there are an infinite number of 3-dimensional lens spaces that are globally homogeneous and also an infinite number that are _ only _ locally homogeneous . in both cases",
    "the lens spaces are quotient spaces of the form @xmath67 where the covering groups are the cyclic groups @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the cyclic groups @xmath68 can act on @xmath64 in different ways parameterized by an integer parameter , denoted by @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 and @xmath70 are relatively prime integers such that @xmath72 .",
    "these quotients are the lens spaces @xmath73 .",
    "the action of @xmath68 on @xmath64 gives rise to globally homogeneous lens spaces only if @xmath74 ; in all other cases the quotient @xmath67 gives rise to lens spaces that are globally inhomogeneous .",
    "one can give a very simple description of the actions of @xmath68 on @xmath64 that give rise to lens spaces . in fact , the 3-sphere can be described as the points of the bi - dimensional complex space @xmath75 with modulus 1 , thus @xmath76 and any action of @xmath68 on @xmath64 giving rise to a lens space is generated by an isometry of the form @xmath77 where @xmath71 and @xmath70 are given as above .",
    "to close this section it is important to recall that since any covering group of spherical space forms is of finite order , all of its elements are cyclic . as a consequence , any 3-dimensional spherical manifold",
    "is finitely covered by a lens space .",
    "thus lens spaces play a special role in studying the topology of spherical manifolds , which motivates their employment below in our study of the problem of detectability of the cosmic topology in nearly flat spherical universes .",
    "unless there are fundamental laws that restrict the topology of the universe , its detection and determination is ultimately expected to be an observational problem , at least at a classical level . as a first step , according to eq .",
    "( [ horlambda ] ) , one would expect the topology of nearly flat compact universe to be detectable from cosmological observations , provided the bound @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) holds , since the typical lengths of the simplest hyperbolic and spherical manifolds are of the order of their curvature radii ( see , for example , the values of @xmath59 and @xmath62 in table  [ tb : hw - census ] ) .",
    "this is , however , a rough estimate and a more appropriate bound will crucially depend upon the detailed shape of the universe , our position in it , and on the cosmological parameters .",
    "this is particularly true in view of the fact that a crucial feature of generic 3-manifolds is their complicated shapes .",
    "moreover , the fact that most 3-manifolds with non - zero curvature are globally inhomogeneous introduces the possibility of _ observer dependence _ ( or _ location dependence _ ) in the topological indicators , in the sense made precise below , which makes it likely for these bounds to be location dependent .",
    "what is therefore called for are indicators which are more sensitive ( accurate ) than @xmath80 and which at the same time take into account the uncertainty in our location in such compact universes .",
    "a natural way to characterize the shape of compact manifolds is through the size of their closed geodesics .",
    "more precisely , for any @xmath81 , the distance function @xmath82 for a given isometry @xmath83 is defined by [ dist - function ] _",
    "g(x ) = d(x , gx ) , which gives the length of the closed geodesic associated with the isometry @xmath84 that passes through @xmath85 .",
    "so one can define the length of the smallest closed geodesic that passes through @xmath81 as @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the covering group without the identity map , i.e. @xmath88 .    in a globally homogeneous manifold , the distance function for any covering isometry @xmath84 is constant , as is the length of the closed geodesic associated with it . however , this is not the case in a locally , but non - globally , homogeneous manifold , where in general the length of the smallest closed geodesic in @xmath26 is given by of our universe is compact , so for any possible manifold a closed geodesic of non - zero minimum length always exists . ]",
    "[ smallest - cg ] l_m = _ x m \\{(x ) } = _ ( g , x ) m \\{_g(x ) } , where @xmath89 denotes the absolute ( global ) minimum of @xmath90 , and @xmath59 clearly satisfies @xmath91 .",
    "injectivity radius _ , which is the radius of the smallest sphere inscribable in @xmath26 ( terminology used in the snappea package  @xcite and in refs .",
    "@xcite ) is then given by @xmath92 .",
    "one can similarly define the injectivity radius at any point @xmath85 as @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , the _ maximal inradius _",
    "@xmath94 , can be defined as the radius of the largest sphere embeddable in @xmath26 , and is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 indicates the absolute ( global ) maximum of @xmath90 .",
    "the maximal inradius @xmath97 is half of the largest distance any point in @xmath26 can be from its closest image .",
    "clearly in the covering space @xmath29 , the maximal inradius @xmath97 is also the radius of the largest sphere inscribable in any fundamental polyhedron ( fp ) of the set of all possible fundamental polyhedra of @xmath26 .",
    "an indicator that has been utilized in most studies regarding searches for topological multiple images , is the ratio of the injectivity radius @xmath98 to @xmath80 ( see , for example ,  @xcite and reference therein and also  @xcite for a similar measure ) . at first sight",
    "this seems to be a very accurate indicator , since it defines the minimum scale required for multiple images to be in principle observable in a given multiply connected universe .",
    "this can be made more practical from an observational point of view by taking instead a different indicator , defined as the ratio of the injectivity radius to the largest distance explored by some astronomical survey @xmath99  @xcite , namely [ r_inj ] t_inj= .",
    "it turns out , however , that such individual indicators based on topological invariants do not encode all the information required to fix the topology uniquely .",
    "thus , more than one indicator is often necessary in practice .",
    "this is the case for the above indicator @xmath100 , an important limitation of which arises from the fact that generic ( globally inhomogeneous ) manifolds are likely to have complicated shapes , making it unlikely for the smallest closed geodesic to pass precisely through our location in the universe .",
    "there is also the fact that in the set of all compact manifolds there is no lower bound to the length of the smallest closed geodesics ( or equivalently on @xmath98 ) , even though each given manifold does have a lower bound @xmath101 .    to partially remedy the first shortcoming above",
    ", one can consider , for an observer @xmath102 situated at @xmath81 , the analogous location dependent measure t_inj ( x ) = .",
    "however , there is still a major problem associated with this indicator , since our uncertainty regarding our location in the universe makes @xmath103 uncertain .    as another indicator",
    ", we take the ratio of the length of the _ maximal inradius _ to @xmath99 , namely [ r_-max ] t_max= .",
    "a crucial feature of this indicator is that it provides a bound which holds for all observers , regardless of their location and in this sense , therefore , circumvents the problem of our ignorance regarding our location in the universe .",
    "we note also that assuming a fixed astronomical survey for a given compact universe , @xmath104 is bounded by the values of @xmath98 and @xmath105 , thus t_inj t_inj ( x ) t_max .",
    "it should be noted that one can not guarantee that the inradius ( given in the fourth column of table  [ tb : hw - census ] ) is the maximal inradius for the corresponding hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "this is so because the inradius is calculated for a specific dirichlet domain , which depends on the basepoint used for its construction .",
    "thus , the same manifold can have different dirichlet domains and so different inradii .",
    "the maximal inradius @xmath97 of a given manifold @xmath26 , however , is unique  @xcite and corresponds to the largest sphere inscribable in any possible fundamental polyhedra of @xmath106 .",
    "the package snappea chooses the basepoint @xmath85 at a local maximum of the inradius , which may or may not be the global ( absolute ) maximum @xmath94 , but the relation @xmath107 clearly holds for all compact hyperbolic ( and elliptic ) manifolds .",
    "we shall show in the next section that the indicator @xmath108 will enable us to exclude certain families of manifolds ( topologies ) as the shape of our universe .",
    "let us close this section by computing @xmath98 and @xmath94 for the lens spaces which will be used in the following sections .",
    "recall that the distance between two points @xmath109 and @xmath110 on @xmath64 is the angle between these points viewed from the origin of complex bi - dimensional space @xmath75 , @xmath111 where @xmath112 indicates the inner product in @xmath75 , and @xmath113 takes the real part of any complex expression .",
    "taking @xmath114 , with @xmath115 as in  ( [ lensspace ] ) , one has @xmath116 if @xmath74 , then @xmath117 is position independent , showing that @xmath118 is globally homogeneous , as anticipated in the previous section .",
    "in the general case of a lens space @xmath73 one obtains @xmath119 since the coefficient of @xmath120 in ( [ distlens ] ) is always non - positive .",
    "in this section we study how the bounds provided by recent cosmological observations can constrain the set of detectable topologies and how given a non - zero lower bound on @xmath121 , we can exclude certain families of manifolds as viable candidates for the shape of our universe .    to study the constraints on detectability as a function of @xmath0 , we begin by considering the horizon radius  ( [ horlambda ] ) . figures  1a and 1b show the behaviour of @xmath80 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath122 .",
    "since in @xmath123@xmath124 plane ( hereafter referred to as the parameter space ) the flat universes are obviously characterized by the straight line @xmath125 , these figures clearly demonstrate that as @xmath126 then @xmath127 , hence showing that , for a given manifold @xmath26 with non - zero curvature , there are values of @xmath128 below which the topology of the universe is undetectable ( @xmath129 for any mix of @xmath5 and @xmath122 .",
    "a crucial feature of this result is the rapid way @xmath80 drops to zero in a narrow neighbourhood of the @xmath130 line . from the observational point of view",
    ", this is significant since it shows that the detection of the topology of the nearly flat models ( @xmath1 ) becomes more and more difficult as @xmath2 , a limiting value favoured by recent observations .    to show concretely how",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath108 can be used to set constraints on the topology of the universe , we recall two recent sets of bounds on cosmological parameters  @xcite , namely    * @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , obtained by combining the data from cmbr and galaxy clusters ; and * @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , obtained by combining the cmbr , supernovae and large scale structure observations .    the bound ( * i * ) exclusively implies positive curvatures for the spatial 3-surfaces , while ( * ii * ) allows negative curvatures as well .",
    "we note that even though the precise values of these bounds are likely to be modified by future observations , the closeness of @xmath0 to @xmath135 is expected to be confirmed .",
    "we have chosen these bounds here as concrete examples of how recent observations may be employed in order to constrain the topology of the universe , and clearly similar procedures can be used for any modified future bounds on cosmological parameters .",
    "let us return to the question of detectability of the topology in the neighbourhood @xmath1 and assume that a particular catalogue which covers the entire sky up to a redshift cut - off @xmath136 .",
    "for a given universe [ with fixed ( @xmath123,@xmath137 ) ] this assumption fixes the values of @xmath138 used in ( [ r_inj ] )    ( [ r_-max ] ) .",
    "suppose that the universe is compact and let @xmath98 denote its injectivity radius .",
    "now if @xmath139 , then the topology of the universe is undetectable by any survey of depth up to the corresponding @xmath140 .",
    "note that this assertion holds regardless of our particular position in the universe , as @xmath141 for all @xmath85 .",
    "also , since @xmath80 is the farthest distance at which events are causally connected to us , one can obtain limits on undetectability by considering @xmath80 rather than @xmath138 .",
    "for example , for a given universe [ fixed ( @xmath123,@xmath124 ) ] any manifold @xmath26 whose @xmath98 has a value that lies above the bird - like surface in figure  1 ( thus ensuring @xmath142 ) is undetectable .",
    "the crucial point here is that as we approach the line @xmath130 , the rapid decrease in the allowed values of @xmath138 will result in a rapid elimination of families of detectable manifolds ( topologies ) .",
    "this is important given that recent observations seem to restrict the cosmological parameters to small regions near the @xmath143 line .    as concrete examples of constraints set by the bound ( * i * ) , we consider universes that possess lens space @xmath73 topologies . using  ( [ r_inj - lens ] ) , and recalling that the topology can not be detected if @xmath144 , one finds that for this family of universes the topology will be undetectable if [ lens - und ] p < p _ * , where @xmath145 is the smallest integer larger than @xmath146 . using ( [ horlambda ] ) and ( [ lens - und ] ) , we have compiled in table  [ tb : lens - und ] the values of @xmath145 for different sets of values of ( @xmath0 , @xmath122 ) contained in bounds ( * i * ) and four catalogues with distinct values of @xmath140 .",

    "it is important to note that from table  [ tb : lens - und ] , one can see that as @xmath0 approaches unity , @xmath145 increases , which implies that an increasing subset of lens space topologies are undetectable , in agreement with figures  1 .",
