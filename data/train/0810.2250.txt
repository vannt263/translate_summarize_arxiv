    "in the fireball model , gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows are thought to be the result of synchrotron radiation generated by electrons during the interaction of a strongly collimated relativistic jet from a compact source with its environment ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "initially the resulting spectra and light curves have been modelled using only the shock front of a spherical explosion and a simple power law approximation for the synchrotron radiation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one or more spectral and temporal breaks were used to connect regimes with different power law slopes . for the dynamics the self similar approximation of a relativistic explosion was used @xcite .",
    "these models have been refined continuously .",
    "more details of the shock structure were included ( e.g. @xcite ) , more accurate formulae for the synchrotron radiation were used ( e.g. @xcite ) and efforts have been made to implement collimation using various analytical approximations to the jet structure and lateral spreading behaviour ( see @xcite for an overview ) . on top of that ,",
    "there have been studies focussing on arrival time effects ( e.g. @xcite ) and some numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "the first aim is to introduce a new method to derive light curves and spectra by post - processing relativistic hydrodynamic ( rhd ) jet simulations of arbitrary dimension , properly taking into account all beaming and arrival time effects , as well as the precise shape of the synchrotron spectrum and electron cooling ( in this paper we will ignore self - absorption , although it can in principle be included in our method ) .",
    "this is done in sections [ peak_section ] and [ cooling_section ] .",
    "the second aim is to present a set of scaling coefficients for the slow - cooling case for a density profile @xmath0 for general values of @xmath1 .",
    "fits to afterglow data using @xmath1 as a free fitting parameter have yielded values markedly different from both @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite , although with error bars not excluding either option .",
    "the scaling coefficients have been obtained by application of our post - process code not to a full hydrodynamic simulation but to an emulation of this . from the spherical blandford & mckee ( bm ) analytical solution for the blast wave for the impulsive energy injection scenario ,",
    "snapshots containing the state of the fluid at given emission times were constructed and stored to provide the input for the post - process code .",
    "the use of the bm solution provides us with an opportunity to check the results and the consistency of the code in an environment where we already have a lot of analytical control and understanding .",
    "the scaling coefficients are presented in section [ coefficients_section ] .",
    "they can be used by observers to obtain the physical parameters for the blast wave ( e.g. explosion energy and circumburst density ) from the values for the peak flux and break frequencies that have been obtained from fits to the data .",
    "readers interested only in the coefficients can skip ahead to this point .",
    "the fluxes in the transitional regions between the different power law regimes have often been described using heuristic equations that smoothly change from one dominant power law to the next .",
    "the abruptness of this change depends on a sharpness parameter @xmath4 .",
    "using the detailed results from our simulations , in section [ smoothpl_section ] we provide equations for @xmath4 in terms of two fit parameters : the slope of the accelerated particle distribution @xmath5 and the aforementioned @xmath1 that describes the circumburst density structure . in section [ application_section ]",
    "we apply our results to grb 970508 .",
    "we discuss our results in section [ discussion_section ] . some cumbersome equations and derivations",
    "have been deferred to appendices .",
    "the code takes as input a series of snapshots of relativistic hydrodynamics configurations on a ( in this paper , one - dimensional ) grid . although we will treat only the analytical blandford - mckee solution @xcite for the blast wave dynamics put on a grid here , the code is written with the intention to interact with the amrvac adaptive mesh refinement code @xcite and will read from file the following conserved variables : @xmath6 with @xmath7 the lorentz factor , @xmath8 the proper density , @xmath9 the relativistic ( i.e. including rest mass ) enthalpy density , @xmath10 the proper velocity , @xmath11 the pressure and @xmath12 the speed of light . from the conserved values we can reconstruct all hydrodynamical quantities using the equation of state @xmath13 where @xmath14 the adiabatic index that is kept fixed and @xmath15 the thermal energy density . in the entire paper",
    ", all comoving quantities will be primed .",
    "the grids represent a spherically symmetric fluid configuration and all grid cells are assumed to emit a fraction of their energy as radiation .",
    "this fraction of course has to be small enough not to affect the dynamics , since the post - processing approach does not allow for feedback . for the time",
    "being we restrict ourselves to the optically thin case .",
    "four ignorance parameters are provided to the code at runtime : @xmath5 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , denoting respectively the slope of the relativistic particle distribution , the fraction of particles accelerated to this relativistic distribution at any given time , the fraction of thermal energy that is carried by the relativistic electrons and the fraction of thermal energy that resides in the ( tangled - up ) magnetic field . to be precise :",
    "the fractions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are fractions of @xmath15 , which is strictly speaking the sum of the thermal energy of the protons and non - accelerated electrons plus the energy of the accelerated electrons plus the magnetic field energy .",
    "since we consider fully relativistic gases , the adiabatic indices of the electrons and protons are both at @xmath19 .",
    "also , if the magnetic flux enclosed by the surface of any arbitrary fluid element is an adiabatic invariant , we find that @xmath20 , which tells us that the behaviour of the magnetic energy density @xmath21 is identical to that of the thermal energy . or in other words",
    ", @xmath18 retains a constant value away from the shock front .",
    "the fraction of shock - accelerated particles @xmath16 is often set to one , but we have already kept it explicit in our calculations . at late times ( i.e. when the fluid flow is no longer relativistic ) @xmath16 has te be lower than unity in order to have enough energy per accelerated particle for synchrotron emission .    in this work",
    "we consider synchrotron radiation only .",
    "all grid cells contain a macroscopic number of radiating particles and the radiation from these particle distributions is calculated following @xcite and @xcite , but with two important differences : the transition to the lab frame is postponed as long as possible and no assumption about the dynamics of the system is used anywhere as this should be provided by the snapshot files .",
    "for clarity of presentation we will ignore the effect of electron cooling in this section .",
    "for the emitted power per unit frequency of a typical electron we have @xmath22 here @xmath23 denotes the electron charge , @xmath24 the electron mass ( later on we will also encounter the proton mass @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 the local magnetic field strength .",
    "the function @xmath27 contains the shape of the spectrum .",
    "it shows the expected limiting behaviour : @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "it incorporates an integration over all pitch angles between electron velocities and the local magnetic field and an integration over the accelerated particle distribution .",
    "we use a power law particle distribution with a lower cut - off lorentz factor @xmath32 . equation ( [ ensemble_electronpower_equation ] ) , the critical frequency @xmath33 and the full shape of @xmath27 are derived in appendix [ distro_section ] .",
    "assuming isotropic radiation in the comoving frame , we arrive at @xmath34 per solid angle @xmath35 .",
    "to get to the _ received _ power per unit volume in the lab frame , we have to apply the correct beaming factors , doppler shift the frequency and multiply the above result for a single particle with the lab frame particle density : @xmath36 with @xmath37 now denoting the cosine of the angle between the fluid velocity and the observer ( unprimed , so measured in the lab frame ) , @xmath38 the fluid velocity in units of @xmath12 and @xmath39 the number density .",
    "finally , the flux the observer receives at a given observer time is given by @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the observer distance denotes the luminosity distance and redshift terms @xmath42 need to be inserted in the appropiate places in the equations .",
    "] , approximately the same for all fluid cells ( though the differences in arrival times _ are _ taken into account ) .",
    "the area @xmath43 denotes the _ equidistant surface_. for every emitting time @xmath44 a specific intersecting ( with the radiating volume ) surface exists from which radiation arrives exactly at @xmath45 .",
    "the integration over the emission times @xmath44 ( represented in the different snapshot files ) requires an extra beaming factor and a factor of @xmath12 to transform the total integral to a volume integral .    to perform the surface integrals",
    ", the post - processing code uses a monte carlo integration algorithm with both importance and stratified sampling , using the pseudo - random sobol sequence . for the integral over emission times ,",
    "a combination of modified midpoint integration and richardson extrapolation is used ( the latter allowing us to occasionally skip a snapshot if the desired convergence is already reached ) .",
    "all methods are explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "a minor complication is here that not every @xmath44 probed has a corresponding snapshot file available and interpolation between snapshot files may be needed .",
    "the boundaries for surface @xmath43 are analytically known conic sections and depend on the jet opening angle and observer angle .",
    "two useful consistency checks are observing a spherical explosion from different angles and calculating the volume of a grid snapshot via integration over different observer times while setting the emissivity to one .    when creating snapshot files directly from the bm solution we found that sufficient convergence ( below the cooling break ) was obtained during the post - processing even for modest grid resolutions .",
    "cm to @xmath46 cm and a relatively small number of snapshots ( @xmath47 ) to go from @xmath48 down to @xmath49 .",
    "unfortunately , the resolution will eventually be dictated by that required by rhd simulations , which will be much higher . ]    for spherical explosions we used jets with an opening angle of 180 degrees , which makes no noticeable difference for the resulting signal because of relativistic beaming .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that it is our method that allows for the modest grid resolution and keeps calculation time short .",
    "this is because instead of binning the output from all grid cells , it takes an observer time as the starting point and then probes the appropriate contributing grid cells only ( resolving the structure within the cell by including neighbouring cells in the interpolation ) .",
    "we have checked our results by increasing the accuracy ( e.g. larger number of grid cells , more snapshot files , smaller step sizes in the integrals etc . ) and by replacing the monte carlo integration routine with a nested one - dimensional bulirsch - stoer algorithm .",
    "these consistency checks are in addition to the two mentioned earlier .",
    "finally we have checked the grid interpolation and snapshot i / o routines by comparing the results of our post - process code with those of a code that does not read profiles from disc but calculates the bm solution at run time .",
    "the code as described so far is purely a post - process code that in principle can be applied directly to the output of any rhd simulation .",
    "if we want to include electron cooling however , we can no longer reconstruct the electron energy distribution from the conserved quantities alone . in the particle distribution function , in addition to the lower boundary @xmath32",
    ", we will also have an upper boundary @xmath50 beyond which all electrons have cooled .",
    "the time evolutions of both the lower cut - off lorentz factor @xmath51 and the upper cut - off lorentz factor @xmath52 ( that we have tacitly kept at infinity in the previous section ) of this distribution are no longer dictated by adiabatic cooling alone but also by radiation losses .",
    "this implies that when running an rhd simulation we need to keep track of at least one extra quantity ( at least @xmath52 , although in practice we will trace both ) .    with the introduction of a second critical frequency @xmath53 ,",
    "the equation describing the total emitted power now becomes , @xmath54 instead of eq .",
    "( [ ensemble_electronpower_equation ] ) . the function @xmath55 and @xmath53",
    "are derived and described in appendix [ cooling_details_section ] . for @xmath50 at infinity",
    "we have @xmath56 .",
    "the particle distribution that lies beneath the derivation of this new function @xmath57 is no longer a simple power law , but drops off sharply for particle lorentz factors approaching the peak value of @xmath52 .",
    "a subtlety worth noting here is that the critical frequency @xmath53 corresponding to @xmath52 is _ not _ the cooling frequency , but a frequency beyond which the signal will drop exponentially . since we put @xmath52 at infinity directly behind the shock , we will not directly observe @xmath53 .",
    "the actual cooling frequency is found between @xmath33 and @xmath53 , at the point where the shape of the particle distribution ceases to be characterized by a power law but starts to be characterized by the strong drop towards @xmath52 .",
    "we will discuss the distinction between the cooled and uncooled region in appendix [ hot_region_section ] .",
    "a consequence of electron cooling is that the amount of energy in the shock - accelerated electrons is no longer a constant fraction of the thermal energy .",
    "@xmath17 now refers to the fraction of thermal energy in the shock accelerated electrons _",
    "directly _ behind the shock front instead and the further evolution of the available energy is traced via @xmath32 and @xmath50 .",
    "especially for high lorentz factors , the shape of the spectrum is dominated by the radiation coming from a very thin slab right behind the shock front .",
    "so we expect the flux to scale as @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the total number of radiating particles and @xmath60 reflects the increasing visible size ( due to decrease of beaming ) of the slab .",
    "the two possible spectra that the code can generate are shown in fig .",
    "[ twospectra ] , where we used the labelling from @xcite to distinguish the different power law regimes . in tables",
    "( [ scalings_table ] ) and ( [ frequencies_table ] ) we give the expressions for the absolute scalings in the different regimes @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and the critical frequencies . scaling coefficients aside , these equations are similar to those given in @xcite .",
    "the flux in regime @xmath61 is denoted by @xmath66 , the critical peak frequency in spectrum 1 is denoted by @xmath67 , the critical cooling frequency in spectrum 1 by @xmath68 and so on .",
    "@xmath69    [ scalings_table ]    @xmath70    [ frequencies_table ]    the equations in the tables introduce a number of symbols that need an explanation .",
    "the cosmic redshift is given by @xmath71 , while the luminosity distance @xmath72 is measured in units of @xmath73 cm .",
    "@xmath74 is the explosion energy @xmath62 in units of @xmath75 erg .",
    "the observer time in days is denoted by @xmath76 .",
    "the characteristic distance @xmath77 we put at @xmath78 cm and @xmath79 and @xmath80 are related via the proton mass : @xmath81 .",
    "the scaling coefficients @xmath82 , @xmath83 etc .",
    "contain a number of numerical constants ( determined by fitting to output from our code ) and some explicit dependencies on @xmath1 and @xmath5 and are further explained in appendix [ scaling_derivation_section ] .",
    "before the cooling break the scaling behaviour is dictated by the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath84 .",
    "the steepening of the spectrum beyond the cooling breaks and the corresponding changes in the scaling behaviour are due to the fact that beyond the cooling break frequency the region behind the shock that still significantly contributes to the total flux ( i.e. the _ hot region _ ) becomes noticably smaller than the shock width .",
    "the changes in the scalings reflects the change in the size of region .",
    "the hot region is discussed separately in appendix [ hot_region_section ] .",
    "in simple power law model fits , the gradual transition between regimes is often handled by a free parameter , the sharpness factor @xmath4 . in more detailed calculations like those done here the gradual transitions are included automatically and we can use this to provide the correct dependence of @xmath4 on @xmath5 and @xmath1 .",
    "this eliminates @xmath4 as a free parameter , simplifying the fit to the data and allowing the shape of the transition to help determine whether a particular model fits the data or not .    for spectrum 1 ,",
    "we use the following equation to describe the flux density near the peak break @xmath67 : @xmath85^{\\textstyle -\\frac{1}{s_{m,1 } } } , \\label{fsmooth_m1_equation}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 denotes the flux at the critical frequency @xmath67 for infinite sharpness @xmath87 ( i.e. the meeting point of the asymptotic power laws ) .",
    "when we switch off cooling in our simulation , we can determine @xmath87 from fitting against the resulting spectrum while keeping the other parameters in equation ( [ fsmooth_m1_equation ] ) fixed .",
    "the sharpness is a function mainly of @xmath5 and to a lesser extent of @xmath1 and the other simulation input parameters . rather than attempting to include all secondary dependencies when formulating a description for @xmath87",
    ", we find that the following approximation for @xmath87 is always valid up to a few percent : @xmath88 when we switch on electron cooling , the flux is best approximated by @xmath89^{\\textstyle -\\frac{1}{s_{m,1 } } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\cdot \\left [ 1 + \\left ( \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{c,1 } } \\right)^{s_{c,1}/2 } \\right]^{\\textstyle -\\frac{1}{s_{c,1}}}. \\label{f1smooth_cooling_equation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we fit this function against simulation output using @xmath90 as a fitting parameter we find that the results are described ( up to a few percent ) by @xmath91 a simultaneous fit using both @xmath87 and @xmath90 yields the same results .    for spectrum 5 the order of the breaks is reversed and the smooth power law for both breaks is given by @xmath92^{\\textstyle -\\frac{1}{s_{c,5 } } } \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\cdot \\left [ 1 + \\left ( \\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{m,5 } } \\right)^{\\textstyle s_{m,5}\\cdot \\frac{p-1}{2 } } \\right]^{\\textstyle -\\frac{1}{s_{m,5}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 denotes the peak flux for infinite sharpness @xmath94 and the prescriptions for the sharpness are @xmath95 and @xmath96 once again valid up to a few percent .",
    "given their accuracies , all sharpness prescriptions are consistent with @xcite .",
    "various authors have used flux scaling equations to derive the physical properties of grb 970508 from afterglow data @xcite .",
    "this provides us with a context to illustrate the scaling laws derived in section [ coefficients_section ] .",
    "we will use the fit parameters obtained from broadband modeling by @xcite .",
    "they have fit simultaneously in time and frequency while keeping @xmath1 as a fitting parameter . because the only model dependencies that have been introduced by this approach are the scalings of @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( and no scaling coefficients ) , their fit results are still fully consistent with our flux equations . using the cosmology @xmath99 , @xmath100 and hubble parameter @xmath101 km s@xmath102 mpc@xmath102 , they have @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xcite , leading , at @xmath105 days , to @xmath106 hz , @xmath107 hz , @xmath108 mjy , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite take for the hydrogen mass fraction of the circumburst medium @xmath111 , which in our flux equations is mathematically equivalent ( though conceptually different ) to setting @xmath112 .",
    "unfortunately this still leaves us with four variables to determine ( @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath74 , @xmath80 ) and only three constraints ( peak flux , cooling and peak frequency ) . from a theoretical study of the microstructure of collisionless shocks @xcite",
    "arrives at the following constraint : @xmath113 we include this constraint to have a closed set of equations .    for the values quoted above we obtain : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 . in figures [ grb970508_spectrum_figure ] and [ grb970508_lightcurves_figure ]",
    "we have plotted a comparison between the spectrum generated by using these values as input parameters for the bm solution and the spectrum as it is represented by applying the results of the broadband fit of @xcite for the values of the critical frequencies and the peak flux to equation ( [ f1smooth_cooling_equation ] ) .",
    "our scaling coefficients were fixed for arbitrary @xmath1 and for comparison we also give results for @xmath118 and @xmath3 .",
    "the ism case is virtually identical to @xmath119 and yields : @xmath114 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath117 .",
    "the stellar wind case yields : @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "the quantity @xmath80 ( the particle number density at the characteristic distance @xmath126 cm ) is affected most .    also for comparison",
    "we give some of the values obtained by other authors .",
    "@xcite obtain for the ism case : @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "@xcite obtain for the ism case : @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "both use @xmath135 .",
    "finally @xcite obtain for @xmath119 : @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "the large differences between the various results illustrate the importance of using the correct scaling coefficients to derive physical parameters of grbs and provide a strong motivation for this work . because the error on @xmath18 in particular is rather large for the quoted authors , who have used the self absorption critical frequency to provide a fourth constraint , the constraint from @xcite can not be rejected based on their fit results .",
    "the extension of our code to include self - absorption will yield an alternative and can be used to further study the applicability of medvedev s constraint .",
    "in this paper we have introduced an approach to reconstruct light curves and spectra from hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the central idea is that we do not start from simulation snapshots and bin the output of each grid cell , but that for representative snapshots we integrate over the intersecting surface that contains all points where radiation is generated that is due to arrive at a given observer time and frequency .",
    "when performing these integrations we interpolate within and between grid cells . while in the context of this paper we have used only snapshots that contain mimicked rhd output using the bm solution , first results using real simulations have been obtained and will be discussed in a later paper . an important thing to note here",
    "is that , even though the post - process code only required a very modest resolution , the underlying hydrodynamics code usually does not .",
    "@xcite used 1200 base level cells and 15 refinement levels to simulate the evolution of the blast wave ( earlier , when they were putting their code to the test they even used 30,000 base level cells at one point , see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that , in general , parallel computer systems are required to run these simulations , something for which the rhd code that our post - process code interacts with ( amrvac ) was explicitly designed .    in our code",
    "we included synchrotron radiation and electron cooling .",
    "we use a parametrisation of the accelerated particle distribution in terms of @xmath50 and @xmath32 . thermal radiation from the particles",
    "not accelerated to a power law distribution can be included in a straightforward manner .",
    "the code can also be extended to include self - absorption and since the outgoing synchrotron radiation from a grid cell is independent of the incoming radiation , this can be done without expanding to a full radiative transfer code including scattering .",
    "effectively , all that is needed is to postpone the integration over the intersecting surfaces until after the integration over emission times , while in the meantime diminishing the output from earlier surfaces according to the column densities in the lines of sight , which amounts to solving linear transport equations only .    as a consistency check and a first application of the code we calculated the scaling coefficients of the flux scaling equations for grb afterglow spectra for arbitrary values of @xmath1 with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "these results can be used to obtain the physical parameters of the burst from fits to afterglow data . for the ism and stellar wind scenario",
    "s the results have been checked against the results of @xcite and are found to be fully consistent .",
    "the motivation for the choice of arbitrary @xmath1 is that various authors have now used @xmath1 as a fitting parameter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "values of @xmath1 other than 0 or 2 reflect the structure of a circumburst medium altered by shock interactions or more complicated stellar wind structures .",
    "we have used grb970508 to illustrate the effect of using our scaling coefficients to deduce the physical properties of a grb .",
    "here we have used an additional constraint by @xcite to obtain a closed set of equations in the absence of a full description for the self - absorption .",

    "another important issue is that the size of the hot region can become smaller than the analytical error inherent in the bm solution , which cuts off beyond @xmath237 .",
    "this happens at late times , when @xmath238 has dropped significantly .",
    "this puts a practical limit on a direct numerical implementation of the bm solution in our radiation code , ironically not due to numerical limitations of the code but because of the upper limit on the accuracy of the analytical solution that we have used to generate our grid files . on",
