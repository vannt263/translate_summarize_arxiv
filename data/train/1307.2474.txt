    ", we establish the convergence of the method to the theoretical solution of the problem . in the limit @xmath11 we recover the standard porous medium equation @xmath12 for which the numerical solution has been studied by many authors , either in itself of as part of the study of the class degenerate parabolic equations , see e.g. @xcite for the earlier literature .",
    "we recall that the fractional laplacian operator @xmath13 , @xmath14 , is probably the best known example in the class of nonlocal diffusion operators that are studied because of their interest both in theory and applications , cf",
    "indeed , fractional diffusions have a long history in modeling problems in physics , finance , mathematical biology and hydrology .",
    "the fractional laplacian operator is usually defined via fourier transform for any function @xmath15 in the schwartz class as the operator such that @xmath16 or via riesz potential , for a more general class of functions , as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a normalization constant . for an equivalence of both formulations",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis of problem was started in paper @xcite where the case @xmath19 was studied .",
    "the extension method that we use to implement the fractional laplacian has a number of specific difficulties for @xmath20 that we address here .",
    "previous works dealing with the numerical analysis of nonlocal equations of this type are due to cifani , jakobsen , and karlsen in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular , they formulate some convergent numerical methods for entropy and viscosity solutions",
    ".    one of the main differences of our work is that we do not directly deal with the integral formulation of the fractional laplacian ; instead of this , we pass through the caffarelli - silvestre extension @xcite , which replaces the calculation of the singular integral by the calculation of a convenient extension in one more space dimension .",
    "while in the case @xmath19 the extension of @xmath21 is just a function @xmath22 which is harmonic in @xmath23 for every @xmath24 fixed , in the cases @xmath20 the extension is a so - called @xmath6-harmonic function , i.e. , the solution of an elliptic equation with a weight that is either degenerate or singular at @xmath25 .",
    "the numerical analysis of the elliptic pde @xmath26 in a bounded domain with zero boundary data via the extension method has been recently studied by nochetto and collaborators using finite elements , @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of the problem we are concerned with .",
    "we present an equivalent way of expressing the problem avoiding the nonlocal operator formulation . for numerical reasons",
    "it is convenient to start by posing the problem in a bounded domain . in section 3",
    "we propose a two - points approximation formula for the weighted derivative that appears in the extension formulation , as well as a proof of the order of convergence ; besides , a numerical experiment is given for this approximation . in section 4",
    "we present the numerical scheme and prove convergence towards the theoretical solution . in sections 5 and 6 we study the optimal and minimal rates of convergence that we can reach with the proposed numerical scheme .",
    "finally , in section 7 we show how the numerical solution posed in a bounded domain @xmath27 converges to the theoretical solution posed in @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "our aim is to find numerical approximations for the solutions of the cauchy problem for the porous medium equation with fractional diffusion , stated in .",
