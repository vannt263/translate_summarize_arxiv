    "currently there is a great interest in computational models consisting of underlying regular computational environments , and distributed computational structures built on them . examples of such models are cellular automata , spacial computation and space - time crystallography  @xcite . for any computational model",
    "it is natural to compare functional , algorithmic and structural properties of different but related computational structures . in the finite automata theory",
    "an example of such comparison is automata homomorphism and , in particular , automata isomorphism .",
    "if we keep to the finite automata theory , a fundamental question what a state of a distributed computational structure is arises .",
    "this work is devoted to a particular solution of the issue .",
    "the work consists of an informal presentation of the background idea of what we mean by computation of a distributed in an environment algorithmic structure , and an illustration of this idea by a simple computational model with a regular and discrete dynamics that is designed specifically for illustration purposes .",
    "the model and the problem statement are similar to the model of  @xcite , but differ from it in essence .",
    "one of the distinguishing features of the model is dynamics of computational structure in the environment .",
    "this produces a number of results concerning the relationship between computational and dynamic properties of these structures .",
    "in this work the collectives of stateless ( i.e. with one state ) automata interacting with an environment defined as a graph are considered .",
    "we study a collective of automata as an integral automaton - like dynamic computational object distributed in an environment .",
    "the fundamental question what is the state of such dispersed and moving on the environment object and how to measure the amount of state transitions is quite non - trivial . as opposed to the finite state automata where the measure of state transition is one state per unit of time , for a computational dynamic object distributed on the environment different approaches to definition of the measure of state transition are certainly possible .",
    "the idea of our approach came from the special relativity theory .",
    "it is based on the concept of relativity in poincar s interpretation  @xcite . in explanation of how to generally understand the relativity poincar begins with an example of resizing of dimensions in the universe by the same number of times and proceeds with considering arbitrary deformations concluding that they should be unnoticed by any observer because his standards are subject to the same deformations .",
    "this reasoning coupled with the principle that the process of computation in the object is not possible without any changes in it is used in this study to define a state of collective automata .",
    "a `` change '' in an object is a change in the relative position of its `` elementary '' parts .",
    "thus , the movement in the environment underlies the process of computation in our model .",
    "let us explain it by an example using pawns on a chessboard , see fig .",
    "[ shess ] .",
    "the chessboard is provided with a natural reference frame .",
    "suppose that we can move any pawn one chess square per unit of time in one of four directions : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , i.e. pawn s velocity is one chess square in a certain direction per unit of time .",
    "let us compose a figure from the pawns , for example , an `` o''-like figure , and look at them as an integral object .",
    "let us define the velocity of the object on the chessboard as the average velocity of its pawns .",
    "suppose that the object is moving at maximal velocity `` one chess square per unit of time '' in a constant direction .",
    "can the object be transformed simultaneously with the motion from `` o '' to , for example , `` t '' ?",
    "it is obvious that it can not .",
    "that is , at maximum constant velocity in the example the object can not be changed and , from our point of view , its state is invariable and it performs no computation .",
    "this point of view is formally illustrated in this work by the simplest example model of stateless automata interacting with @xmath0-dimensional environment .",
    "note that the figure  [ shess ] is not quite correct from our point of view as pawns have two states : good and bad moods .",
    "easy to see that on the third chessboard letter `` o '' differs from the first two .",
    "we consider only the case of stateless pawns .",
    "the introduced illustrative model is computationally universal , and collectives of automata in the environment can be seen as automaton - like computational objects . by analogy with turing machines , which can answer certain questions about properties of words on the tapes , natural questions arise for these objects , such as what properties of the environment and other objects in it they can identify .",
    "one of the interesting questions is what can an object say about the velocity of its elementary parts ( i.e. stateless automata ) .",
    "can it `` perceive '' any changes in velocity of elementary parts it consists of ?",
    "this question is similar to the issue in the poincar s story about relativity : can the observer see the deformation of the space , which includes the deformation of measurement standards ? having the answer `` no '' as a goal , we define our computational model .",
    "this goal determines the language ( motion velocity , proper time velocity as a measure of state transition , reference frame ) of interaction between collectives of automata .    to emphasize a physical analogy in the proposed model and the problem statement we use the short word `` body '' as alias for `` collective of automata '' .",
    "this work develops  @xcite .",
    "the computational model used in this study consists of two main components : an underlying environment @xmath5 that is represented by a graph and a set of stateless automata interacting with the environment .",
    "the environment @xmath5 is an infinite or finite directed graph defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 be a finite set that we call the set of _",
    "directions_. without loss of generality , we assume that all directions are numbered by integers from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "we associate with each arc in the graph a direction from @xmath6 . for each arc",
    "@xmath9 there exists an arc @xmath10 of the same direction .",
    "all arcs ending in the same vertex have different directions .",
    "all arcs that start in the same vertex have different directions .",
    "if different arcs @xmath11 and @xmath12 end in the same vertex we will say that they are intersecting arcs .",
    "the neighborhood of an arc @xmath11 is understood to be the set of all @xmath11 intersecting arcs .",
    "let the graph @xmath5 be embedded in an @xmath0-dimensional affine metric space @xmath13 as follows .",
    "each arc is a line segment of length @xmath7 .",
    "adjacent arcs of the same direction lie on the same line .",
    "thus the set of directions @xmath6 takes on the meaning of the set of @xmath0-dimensional vectors in @xmath13 .",
    "we call the set of vectors @xmath6 the set of _ actual spacial directions_. let us fix the origin of the space @xmath13 so that it coincides with some vertex of the graph .",
    "thus , each vertex and each point of the arcs get an @xmath0-dimensional coordinate in the space @xmath13 .",
    "the space @xmath13 is said to be absolute , and the coordinates in it absolute spacial coordinates .    as usual",
    ", let @xmath14 be a mealy automaton , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the sets of states , input symbols , and output symbols , respectively , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are transition function and function of outputs respectively .",
    "we consider only stateless mealy automata .",
    "the set of states of a stateless automaton consists of a single state , so there is no sense in mentioning its transition function and its set of states .",
    "thus we write @xmath20 instead of @xmath14 . within the framework of this article for reasons of consistency of latter definitions we name a stateless mealy automaton an _ elementary body _ , and we name its unique state as the _ internal state_. the elementary bodies will be denoted by lowercase letters , for example , @xmath21 .",
    "we assume also that elementary bodies are coloured in a way that isomorphic automata will have the same colour and non - isomorphic automata will have different colours .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 different colours numbered from @xmath7 to @xmath22 are used .",
    "every integral moment of time @xmath23 , that we call absolute , any elementary body @xmath24 is located on an arc @xmath25 of the environment @xmath5 .",
    "the input for an elementary body @xmath24 is the ordered set @xmath26 called the _ neighbourhood state _ of the arc @xmath25 , where @xmath27 are the number of all elementary bodies of the colour @xmath28 located on the arc of direction @xmath29 that ends in the same vertex as @xmath25 at the moment of time @xmath23 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the definition does not imply that the input set is finite .",
    "we have done nothing to circumvent this problem but we can simply assume that elementary bodies interact in such a way that the set of all possible input symbols can only be finite .",
    "the output of an elementary body is a direction from @xmath6 .",
    "if the output of an elementary body @xmath24 at a moment of time @xmath23 is the direction @xmath29 and the arc @xmath25 ends in the vertex @xmath32 , then at the next moment of time the arc @xmath33 starts from @xmath32 and has direction @xmath29 .",
    "if the arcs @xmath25 and @xmath33 are of the same direction we say that @xmath24 does not change its _ external state _ at the moment of time @xmath23 .",
    "otherwise we say that @xmath24 changes its _",
    "external state_. if @xmath24 does not change its external state we also say that @xmath24 moves rectilinearly .",
    "additionally we assume that each elementary body can not change its external state if all intersecting arcs are empty , that is , the interaction between elementary bodies occurs only by collisions in the vertices of the environment ( compare with the notion of vacuum state in  @xcite ) .",
    "the elementary bodies can be seen as analogues of signals propagating in the causal network  @xcite .",
    "propagation of signals in  @xcite depends on the functions in the nodes of a causal network , in our model it depends on the output functions @xmath34 of elementary bodies , i.e. , on the properties of `` signal '' .",
    "let us represent discrete dynamics of elementary bodies in the graph @xmath5 by the continuous dynamics in @xmath13 as follows .",
    "let @xmath24 be at an integral moment of time @xmath23 on the arc @xmath35 .",
    "let the @xmath0-dimensional absolute spacial coordinates of the vertices @xmath36 and @xmath37 be @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "then the elementary body @xmath24 at time @xmath40 , @xmath41 , has the absolute spacial coordinate @xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 the absolute spacial coordinate of @xmath24 at time @xmath23 .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 a measure of external state transition of @xmath24 until the moment of time @xmath23 . by definition ,",
    "if the elementary body @xmath24 moved rectilinearly from a moment of time @xmath45 to @xmath46 , then @xmath47 .",
    "definition of functional behavior of @xmath48 when @xmath24 moves nonrectilinearly requires additional considerations that we provide below .",
    "we call @xmath49 the _ proper time _ of @xmath24 and @xmath50 the _ proper time velocity _ of @xmath24 .",
    "we call @xmath51 uniform proper time velocity if @xmath51 is a constant .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 the _ absolute spacial velocity _ of @xmath24 at the moment of time @xmath23 .",
    "we call it uniform spacial velocity if @xmath53 is a constant .",
    "we call the pair of a space coordinate @xmath32 and a time coordinate @xmath23 as ( spacial - time ) coordinate in the _ absolute reference frame _ @xmath54",
    ". we shall call @xmath54 the event space as well .",
    "in addition to absolute reference frame @xmath54 we introduce the notion of _ absolute actual reference frame _ @xmath55 as follows .",
    "let @xmath56 be the set of spacial coordinates of all vertices of graph @xmath5 .",
    "we construct a graph @xmath57 with the set of vertices @xmath58 such that there exists an arc from a vertex @xmath59 to a vertex @xmath60 if and only if the arc @xmath61 belongs to the graph @xmath5 and @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the dynamics of an elementary body in the @xmath54 is the dynamics on the graph @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the set of vectors @xmath63 in the space @xmath13 .",
    "let us denote @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "we call the ordered set @xmath67 the set of actual space - time directions , or simply the set of _ actual directions_.    [ lemma:1 ] let an elementary body @xmath24 be in the origin of space @xmath13 at the time @xmath68 . then a space - time",
    "coordinate @xmath69 of @xmath24 at a moment of time @xmath23 can be represented as a linear combination of actual directions .",
    "the proof is obvious because elementary body moves only in actual directions in the event space @xmath54 .",
    "note that the definitions do not imply the linear independence of actual directions .",
    "but we say that the coefficients of linear combination of actual directions that forms a vector @xmath69 are coordinates of @xmath69 in the absolute actual reference frame @xmath55 . by definition ,",
    "we assume that the dimensions of linear spaces @xmath54 and @xmath55 are equal .",
    "let us proceed to considering the collectives of elementary bodies .",
    "a body is an arbitrary finite set of elementary bodies .",
    "according to the defintion different bodies may have common parts and one body can contain another body as a subset . if an elementary body belongs to a body then we will consider it as an elementary part of this body . an elementary body can be an elementary part of different bodies simultaneously .    let a body @xmath70 consist of @xmath0 elementary bodies enumerated by @xmath71 .",
    "then the absolute ( average ) coordinate of the body @xmath70 at time @xmath23 is the value @xmath72 and absolute spacial velocity of @xmath70 at time @xmath23 is the value @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from the definitions that the maximum modulus of spacial velocity of the bodies is @xmath7 .",
    "a body interacting with other bodies influences them and is also under their influence .",
    "it is quite natural to describe such influences on the basis of the notion of a state of a body .",
    "our definition of a state of a body takes into consideration the relative position of its elementary parts in the environment .",
    "the changes of relative position of elementary parts in a body can affect the whole body or its part .",
    "this motivates the question how to measure the amount of state transition . before defining the notion of a state , that we will call the external state and",
    "that generalises the notion of the external state of elementary body , we introduce the denotation for the measure @xmath74 of external state transition of a body @xmath70 with the flow of absolute time @xmath23 .",
    "a casual meaning of @xmath74 is the `` age '' of the body @xmath70 at the moment @xmath23 .",
    "we call @xmath74 the proper time of @xmath70 .    independently from the definition of @xmath74 , we introduce the velocity @xmath75 of the proper time of @xmath70 as @xmath76 .",
    "we call this value as the proper time velocity of @xmath70 at the moment of the absolute time @xmath23 .    for any body",
    "@xmath70 @xmath77    if @xmath78 then we say that the body @xmath70 does not change its external state at the moment of time @xmath23 .",
    "it follows from this that a body @xmath70 does not change its external state if all its elementary bodies do not change their external states .",
    "it means that two bodies are at the same external state in the environment if one of them can be transformed into another by straight - line shifts on the equal number of steps applied to all its elementary parts in direction corresponding to their external states .",
    "note that the definition does not forbid a situation when the body has zero absolute spacial velocity and zero absolute proper time velocity simultaneously , see  @xcite .    for any body @xmath70 ,",
    "if @xmath79 then @xmath78 .",
    "the statement follows from the fact that any change of the external state of a body is not possible in case of maximal spacial velocity of all its elementary parts .",
    "we have defined the meaning of two bodies being in the same external state , rather than what the external state of a body in fact is .",
    "if needed the notion of external state can be generally defined as follows : since the relation `` to be in the same external state '' is an equivalence relation , the external states are equivalence classes of this relation .",
    "the same holds for the latter definition of internal state .",
    "definition of functional behavior of @xmath80 when @xmath70 changes its external state will be given below .",
    "the notion of external state of a body allows to start considering the bodies as an automata - like model of algorithms .",
    "it is natural to ask a functional equivalence of different bodies for example something like automata isomorphism in the finite automata theory .",
    "but because two bodies with different absolute spacial velocities are definitely in different external states we can not compare them functionally .",
    "for example there is no sense to `` ask '' a body to determine its absolute spacial velocity .",
    "however we would like to identify two bodies as the same algorithm even if they move with different spacial velocities .",
    "it will be achieved by introduction of affine isomorphism of bodies through definition of inertial reference frame associated with a body so that the external state of a body will be presented as a pair of components : spacial velocity of the body and its spacial velocity invariant internal state .",
    "the point of introducing the notion of inertial reference frame associated with a body lies in the ability to consider other bodies in relation to the given one . with reference frames we attempt to develop a language of interaction between bodies just as the input and output alphabets of finite mealy automata are for the interaction between them .",
    "the language that we develop is one of the many possible and thus our approach reflects a poincar s conventional point of view on the physical laws .",
    "an example of inertial reference frame is the absolute reference frame @xmath54 associated with an immovable body @xmath70 such that for all @xmath23 @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and , hence , @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the introduced notions of absolute time , absolute coordinate and absolute spacial velocity implicitly mean an absolutely motionless body in relation to which objects were considered .",
    "the reference frames associated with the bodies allow us to make these notions relative .",
    "let us denote ( for a pair of bodies @xmath86 and @xmath70 ) by @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 the coordinate , the spacial velocity , the proper time velocity and the proper time of the body @xmath86 at the moment of time @xmath91 in the reference frame @xmath92 associated with the body @xmath70 , respectively . by definition",
    "we assume that @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the only restriction imposed on the inertial reference frames is the property that space - time coordinates of same events in different inertial reference frames are connected by affine transformation .",
    "it follows that a body that is inertial in the absolute inertial reference frame is inertial in any other inertial reference frame .    for any bodies",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath70 let us denote by @xmath98 the affine mapping that connects @xmath92 and @xmath17 such that each event @xmath99 in @xmath92 coincides with the event @xmath100 in @xmath17 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the origins of both reference frames @xmath17 and @xmath92 are the same : @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "then the mapping @xmath103 is linear .",
    "the directions of reference frame axes are imaginary directions in the event space .",
    "but the directions of the vectors @xmath67 in the absolute reference frame correspond to the only possible `` real '' motion directions of elementary bodies going from a graph vertex that coincide with the reference frame origin and therefore they do not depend on reference frames .",
    "it follows that the actual directions are invariant by any affine transformation of reference frames .    in the following",
    "we demonstrate that the number @xmath104 of actual space - time directions is equal to the dimension @xmath105 of the event space @xmath54 .",
    "till then we choose @xmath105 linearly independent actual space - time directions and further we consider only the arcs in the graph that correspond to these directions .",
    "a fragment of an suitable @xmath106-dimensional environment is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "therefore , we can use the coordinates @xmath107 in the reference frame @xmath55 along with the coordinates @xmath108 in the reference frame @xmath54 , and also introduce the notion of actual reference frame @xmath109 associated with the body @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath110 be the mapping that connects @xmath55 and @xmath54 such that an event @xmath111 in @xmath54 coincides with the event @xmath112 in @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath113 be the mapping that connects @xmath114 and @xmath17",
    ". from the definitions follows        now , to uniquely determine the state transition measure @xmath117 it is sufficient to determine @xmath118 and @xmath119 . by definition , for example , we can assume that the coordinate @xmath120 in the frame @xmath17 coincides with the coordinate @xmath121 in the reference frame @xmath109 .",
    "it means that we assume @xmath122 and redefine @xmath123 in the reference frame @xmath54 , @xmath65 .",
    "we proceed similarly with the absolute reference frames @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the transformations @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath103 are uniquely defined and we have completely defined the measure of the external state transition in the absolute reference frame and in the inertial reference frames as well .    because the transformation matrix @xmath119 in the general case looks like @xmath124 where @xmath125 can be pairwise different , then the number of eigenvectors @xmath103 is exactly equal to @xmath105 , and therefore the following theorem holds .",
    "now we give a definition of the _ internal state _ of a body .",
    "let there be a bijection @xmath126 for bodies @xmath86 and @xmath70 such that for all @xmath127 elementary bodies @xmath24 and @xmath128 are isomorphic ( of the same `` colour '' ) .",
    "we say that @xmath86 at the moment of proper time @xmath129 and @xmath70 at the moment of proper time @xmath80 are _ affine isomorphic _",
    ".      internal state of an inertial body does not depend on its spacial velocity in the absolute reference frame .",
    "thus , the external state of an inertial body can be seen as a combination of two components : the spacial velocity of the body and its internal state .",
    "because the spacial velocity of inertial bodies is constant , then by definition we can state that the measure of external state transition and the measure of internal state transition are the same .",
    "if we now consider the body as an automata - like computational structure , whose states are defined as the internal states , the seemingly natural question whether a body can determine its own absolute velocity is by definition an algorithmically unsolvable problem or a meaningless question . if body states are by definiton the external states , then the same question has no substance , since the external state always contains information about the absolute velocity .      in this paper",
    "we have generalised the approach developed in  @xcite to the @xmath0-dimensional case , @xmath132 , through the introduction of actual reference frames . in",
    "@xcite the case of @xmath7-dimensional environment with examples of affine isomorphic bodies is considered in detail , and some corollaries of the approach about the relationship between computational @xmath133 and dynamic @xmath134 properties of the bodies in the form of the time dilation formula , the velocity - addition formula , the length contraction / extension formula , etc . are shown .",
