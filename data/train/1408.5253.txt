    "tidal effects are commonly associated with spacetime curvature properties . in particular ,",
    "when the spacetime is that of a black hole , such effects result in deforming and even tidally disrupting astrophysical objects , like ordinary stars but also compact objects like neutron stars .",
    "it is also widely believed that such tidal disruption events happen very frequently in the universe , leading then to a possible detection of the associated emission of gravitational waves in the near future by ground - based detectors such as ligo or virgo and their advanced versions @xcite .",
    "motivated by this interesting perspective , there has been in the recent literature a big effort to study tidal effects in many contexts , especially the merging of compact object binaries .",
    "in fact , the presence of tidal interactions during the inspiral phase of neutron star - neutron star ( nsns ) and black hole - neutron star ( bhns ) binaries affects both the dynamics of the inspiral and the emitted waveform .",
    "the techniques adopted range from newtonian gravity to full general relativity , passing through post - newtonian approaches and numerical relativity simulations @xcite .",
    "nsns and bhns binary mergers can be accurately modeled only by numerical simulations in full general relativity , solving the coupled einstein - hydrodynamics equations .",
    "however , there is a variety of analytical and semi - analytical approaches which allow to properly describe at least part of the coalescence process and to study the associated gravitational wave signals .",
    "flanagan and hinderer @xcite adopted a post - newtonian based description of the binary dynamics to study the influence of tidal effects in inspiralling bhns systems . within the newtonian theory of tidal love numbers",
    "@xcite they estimated the tidal responses of a neutron star to the external tidal solicitation of its companion , potentially measurable in gravitational wave signals from inspiralling binary neutron stars by earth - based detectors .",
    "the corresponding relativistic theory of love numbers has been developed by binnington and poisson @xcite .",
    "an improvement of the analysis done in ref .",
    "@xcite , whose validity was limited only to the early ( lower - frequency ) portion of the gravitational wave inspiral signal , was presented by damour and nagar @xcite , who used an extension of the so called `` effective one body approach '' to describe with sufficient accuracy the binary dynamics including tidal effects and covering the whole frequency range of the gravitational wave signal .    according to the standard theory of tides ,",
    "the motion of an extended body in a given gravitational field is studied under the assumption that it causes only a small perturbation on the background , so that the emission of gravitational radiation are properly discussed in the framework of first order perturbation theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "obviously the explicit expression of the tidal forces depends on the nature of the body under consideration , i.e. , on the particular form of the energy - momentum tensor describing it .",
    "for instance , one can assume a perfect fluid .",
    "in general the energy momentum tensor can be determined by the complete set of its multipole moments with respect to a world line representing the motion of the body , according to dixon s model @xcite .",
    "relativistic tidal problems have been extensively studied in the so - called tidal approximation , i.e. , by assuming that the mass of the star is much smaller than the black hole mass and that the stellar radius is smaller than the orbital radius , thus neglecting backreaction effects . in this approximation , the center of mass of the star",
    "is assumed to move around the black hole along a timelike geodesic path and the tidal field due to the black hole is computed from the riemann tensor in terms of the geodesic deviation equation .",
    "the internal stresses are usually accounted under the approximation that the classical laws of motion hold for the different points of the body relative to the center of mass , when the external tidal forces are neglected .",
    "therefore , the body is usually described as a self - gravitating newtonian fluid where the gravitational potential associated with the tidal potential is linearly superposed to the internal forces .",
    "such a framework has been widely used to study the tidal disruption limit of ordinary stars and compact objects @xcite .",
    "if the dimensions of the body are assumed to be much smaller than the characteristic length scale associated with the background field , the motion of the extended body can be also described by the mathisson - papapetrou - dixon equations @xcite . according to these ,",
    "when the structure of the body is given by its spin only the deviation from geodesic motion is due to the magnetic part of the riemann tensor @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the extended body can be represented by a collection of pointlike particles each following a timelike path .",
    "the separation between a reference world line within the congruence ( say that of a fiducial observer  ) and a generic one is represented by a connecting vector , whose components with respect to an orthonormal frame adapted to the observer satisfy a second order deviation equation @xcite . in the case of a geodesic congruence one can set up a parallel transported frame so that the geodesic deviation equation takes a form reminiscent of a newtonian equation @xcite , where tidal forces are due to a newtonian quadrupole field .",
    "the electric part of the riemann tensor represents the only direct curvature contribution to the geodesic deviation equation ( as well as the deviation equation for general non - geodesic motion ) , introducing shearing forces .",
    "such an approach has been used to study tidal dynamics of relativistic flows in the kerr spacetime for different choices of the reference world line @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the role of the observer in relativistic tidal problems and to provide all necessary tools to relate the measurement of tidal effects by different families of observers .",
    "in fact , if tidal forces are due to curvature , the latter is experienced by observers , i.e. , test particles or extended bodies ( hereafter simply observers `` ) , through the electric and magnetic parts of the riemann tensor .",
    "the riemann tensor is indeed the true @xmath0-dimensional invariant quantity , whereas the various parts mentioned above depend on the choice of the observers who perform the measurement .",
    "we will start by examining in detail all these definitions and notions , including the corresponding transformation laws arising when changing the observer in full generality .",
    "we will consider then two tidal indicators '' defined as the trace of the square of the electric and magnetic and mixed parts of the riemann tensor , respectively .",
    "they are both curvature and observer dependent and we will explore how they change when the observer also changes .    to be more explicit and to relate our work to other existing studies , we discuss the case of a kerr spacetime and the family of circularly rotating ( accelerated ) observers in the equatorial plane .",
    "there exists a whole collection of geometrically special circular orbits @xcite in the equatorial plane of the kerr spacetime which arise in the discussion of some geometrical and physical features ( i.e. , transport laws for vectors , geodesics and accelerated orbits , clock effects , circular holonomy , etc . ) .",
    "they have been classified in ref .",
    "@xcite with respect to their geometrical meaning as follows : extrinsically special orbits , in the sense that their specialness comes from the background geometry ; intrinsically special orbits , in the sense that their specialness comes from the intrinsic frenet - serret properties of the curve itself ; relatively special orbits , in the sense that their specialness is with respect to other curves .",
    "we will investigate the properties of tidal indicators as associated with each special family of observers mentioned above , so providing a complete analysis of tidal forces .",
    "previous works limited their considerations only to geodesic observers , thus giving only a partial insight into the tidal problem .",
    "relative - observer tidal indicators should play instead a more central role .",
    "furthermore , special observers can be identified as suitable to study relativistic tidal dynamics .",

    "<S> the observer - dependent tidal effects associated with the electric and magnetic parts of the riemann tensor with respect to an arbitrary family of observers are discussed in a general spacetime in terms of certain tidal indicators .  the features of such indicators </S>",
    "<S> are then explored by specializing our considerations to the family of stationary circularly rotating observers in the equatorial plane of the kerr spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> there exist a number of observer families which are special for several reasons and for each of them such indicators are evaluated </S>",
    "<S> . the transformation laws of tidal indicators when passing from one observer to another are also discussed , clarifying the interplay among them . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that no equatorial plane circularly rotating observer in the kerr spacetime can ever measure a vanishing tidal electric indicator , whereas the family of carter s observers measures zero tidal magnetic indicator . </S>"
