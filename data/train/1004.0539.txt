    "to investigate whether 2 m  j044144  b is a companion to 2 m  j044144  a , we begin by plotting a color - magnitude diagram in figure  [ fig : iz ] from photometry at f791w and f850lp for all unsaturated sources in our entire wfpc2 survey of 32 brown dwarfs in taurus .",
    "four of the substellar primaries are absent from the diagram because they are saturated in one of the filters .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : iz ] , 2 m  j044144  b appears near the bottom of the sequence of the known members of taurus , indicating that it has the appropriate magnitudes and color for a low - mass companion .",
    "given the spectral types of the known members , these data suggest a spectral type of m9.5-l0 for 2 m  j044144  b. in addition , the line connecting the primary and secondary is parallel to the cluster sequence , which is consistent with the coevality that is expected for the components of a binary system .",
    "we can use the data in figure  [ fig : iz ] to estimate the probability that our companion survey would detect a field star that has the photometric properties of a low - mass taurus member .",
    "we assume that the sequence of taurus members becomes vertical at the faintest magnitudes in figure  [ fig : iz ] ( @xmath25 ) , which is supported by the location of the coolest known member and the fact that the @xmath26 colors of field dwarfs do not increase significantly from m8 to mid - l @xcite . in that case ,",
    "@xmath27 objects in figure  [ fig : iz ] ( in addition to the known brown dwarfs ) have colors and magnitudes that are consistent with membership in taurus .",
    "therefore , the surface density of field stars that could be mistaken for taurus members is @xmath27 divided by the total area of the wfpc2 images , which is 160  arcmin@xmath28 .",
    "the probability of a field star of this kind appearing within @xmath29 of any of the 32 primaries in our survey is @xmath30 .",
    "the two epochs of astrometry from wfpc2 and niri provide an additional constraint on the companionship of 2 m  j044144  b. we first consider whether the astrometry for 2 m  j044144  b is consistent with the negligible motion expected for the vast majority of background stars .",
    "accurate measurements of the proper motion for the primary are not available .",
    "therefore , we adopt for the primary the average proper motion of the nearest group of taurus members ( @xmath31 , @xmath32  mas  yr@xmath16 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . combining this proper motion with the astrometry from the first epoch",
    ", we find that the separation and position angle of the candidate companion would have become @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the second epoch if it had no proper motion , which is inconsistent with our measurements in table  [ tab : astro ] .    according to the data in table  [ tab : astro ] ,",
    "2 m  j044144  a and b maintained the same relative positions to within @xmath35  mas over a period of 1.15 years , indicating that their proper motions agree at a level of @xmath36  mas  yr@xmath16 in each direction .",
    "only a small fraction of field stars are expected to have proper motions that are similar to that of 2 m  j044144  a. for instance , using multi - epoch _",
    "hubble _ images of chamaeleon  i that are comparable in depth to our wfpc2 data in taurus , we find that @xmath37% of field stars have proper motions that are consistent with those of cluster members at the level of the uncertainties in the relative proper motions of 2 m  j044144  a and b. if we adopt this value for taurus , which is similar to chamaeleon  i in its distance and the magnitude of its proper motion , then the probability of a field star exhibiting wfpc2 photometry that is indicative of a taurus member , a separation of @xmath38 from one of our 32 primaries , and a proper motion similar to that of taurus is @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that 2 m  j044144  b is a companion to 2 m  j044144  a.    the possible wide companion 2 m  j044145 appears within one of the wfc arrays , but it is too heavily saturated for the detection of its candidate companion . as a result ,",
    "we can not place constraints on the proper motions of those two objects relative to each other .",
    "we can estimate the bolometric luminosity of 2 m  j044144  b if we apply a bolometric correction to its photometry at @xmath24 . in previous studies of young brown dwarfs",
    ", we have adopted bolometric corrections derived for field dwarfs , but doing so may not be perfectly valid for 2 m  j044144  b since some of the ir colors of young objects later than m9 differ from those of dwarfs @xcite . to determine an appropriate value of bc@xmath40 for 2 m  j044144  b , we have estimated bolometric luminosities for young brown dwarfs from m9.5l0 for which relatively complete spectral energy distributions have been measured , consisting of the taurus member kpno  4 ( m9.5 , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite , a linear interpolation of the fluxes between 2.5  and 3.2  , and a rayleigh - jeans distribution longward of 9.2  .",

    "these bolometric corrections are larger than those of dwarfs by @xmath44  mag @xcite .",
    "based on these measurements , we adopt bc@xmath45 for 2 m  j044144  b.    the @xmath46 color from 2mass and the 0.8 - 1.8  spectrum from @xcite for 2 m  j044144  a+b indicate @xmath47 when they are compared to average intrinsic colors and spectra of young brown dwarfs @xcite . in the @xmath48 band ,",
    "the spectroscopy and 2mass photometry of the system and our resolved photometry for the primary are slightly redder than a stellar photosphere with the spectral type of the primary , which is probably caused by emission from a circumstellar disk based on the excess emission detected at longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have not applied an extinction correction to the photometry for 2 m  j044144  b. when we combine @xmath49 , bc@xmath45 , @xmath50 , and the average distance of taurus ( @xmath51  pc , * ? ? ?",

    "given the uncertainties in its age ( few myr ) and luminosity ( @xmath53  dex ) , 2 m  j044144  b could have a mass between 5 and 10  @xmath1 according to the models of @xcite and @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "we include in figure  [ fig : lbol ] the luminosities of other resolved companions that appear to have masses below @xmath54  @xmath1 and that are younger than 10  myr , which consist of 2m1207 - 3932  b @xcite , dh  tau  b @xcite , chxr  73  b @xcite , ct  cha  b @xcite , and irxs1609  b @xcite .",
    "the first planetary - mass companion to be detected through direct imaging was 2mass j12073346 - 3932539  b ( @xmath55  au , @xmath56  @xmath1 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which is bound to a young brown dwarf in the tw hya association ( @xmath57  myr , @xmath58  @xmath1 , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "this result is consistent with the rapid formation expected from both gravitational instability in disks and fragmentation of cloud cores .",
