    "while the overly successful experiments at the lhc are exploring the higgs sector and are systematically searching for signals of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , we must not be carried away losing track of a longstanding , unresolved puzzle in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the otherwise well - established su(3 ) gauge theory of the strong interactions , right in the core of the sm .",
    "in fact , despite concerted experimental and theoretical efforts ever since the discovery of the @xmath0 meson in the november revolution of 1974 ( the nobel prize in physics 1976 ) , the genuine mechanism underlying the production and decay of heavy quarkonia , which are qcd bound states of a heavy quark @xmath6 and its antiparticle @xmath7 , has remained mysterious .",
    "nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd)@xcite endowed with an appropriate factorization theorem , which was conjectured in a seminal work by bodwin , braaten , and lepage@xcite and explicitly proven through next - to - next - to - leading order for large transverse momenta @xmath8,@xcite arguably constitutes the most probable candidate theory at the present time .",
    "this implies a separation of process - dependent short - distance coefficients , to be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath9 , from supposedly universal long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) , to be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules,@xcite which predict each of the ldmes to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark velocity @xmath10 in the limit @xmath11 . in this way",
    ", the theoretical predictions are organized as double expansions in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that the @xmath12 pair can at short distances be produced in any fock state @xmath13}$ ] with definite spin @xmath14 , orbital angular momentum @xmath15 , total angular momentum @xmath16 , and color multiplicity @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , this formalism predicts the existence of intermediate color - octet ( co ) states in nature , which subsequently evolve into physical , color - singlet ( cs ) quarkonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons . in the limit @xmath18 , the traditional cs model ( csm )",
    "is recovered in the case of @xmath14-wave quarkonia . in the case of @xmath0 production ,",
    "the csm prediction is based just on the @xmath19}$ ] cs state , while the leading relativistic corrections , of relative order @xmath20 , are built up by the @xmath21}$ ] , @xmath22}$ ] , and @xmath23}$ ] ( @xmath24 ) co states .",
    "the csm is not a complete theory , as may be understood by noticing that the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) treatment of @xmath25-wave quarkonia is plagued by uncanceled infrared singularities , which are , however , properly removed in nrqcd .",
    "this conceptual problem can not be cured from within the csm , neither by proceeding to higher orders nor by invoking @xmath26 factorization _ etc .",
    "_ in a way , nrqcd factorization,@xcite appropriately improved at large values of @xmath8 by systematic expansion in powers of @xmath27,@xcite is the only game in town , which makes its experimental verification such a matter of paramount importance and general interest.@xcite    the experimental test of nrqcd factorization@xcite has been among the most urgent tasks on the agenda of the international quarkonium community@xcite for almost two decades and , with high - quality data being so copiously harvested at the lhc , is now more tantalizing than ever . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the present status of testing nrqcd factorization in charmonium production .",
    "we consider the inclusive production of @xmath0 mesons in collisions of two particles @xmath28 and @xmath29 . owing to the factorization theorems of the qcd parton model and nrqcd,@xcite the cross section",

    ", we have @xmath42 . in the case of @xmath5 annihilation , all distribution functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xs ] ) are delta functions .",
    "the hadronic system @xmath43 always contains one hard parton at leading order ( lo ) and is taken to be void of heavy flavors , which may be tagged and vetoed experimentally.@xcite the partonic cross sections appropriate for the direct production of unpolarized @xmath0 mesons were calculated at nlo in nrqcd in refs .   for direct photoproduction , in refs .   for hadroproduction , and in ref .",
    "for resolved photoproduction , two - photon scattering involving both direct and resolved photons , and @xmath5 annihilation .    in our numerical analysis",
    ", we set @xmath44  gev , adopt the values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the branching ratios @xmath47 and @xmath48 from ref .  , and use the one - loop ( two - loop ) formula for @xmath49 , with @xmath50 active quark flavors , at lo ( nlo ) .",
    "as for the proton pdfs , we use set cteq6l1 ( cteq6m)@xcite at lo ( nlo ) , which comes with an asymptotic scale parameter of @xmath51  mev ( 326  mev ) . as for the photon pdfs , we employ the best - fit set afg04_bf of ref .  .",
    "we evaluate the photon flux function using eq .",

    "our default choices for the renormalization , factorization , and nrqcd scales are @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , where @xmath57 is the @xmath0 transverse mass .",
    "the bulk of the theoretical uncertainty is due to the lack of knowledge of corrections beyond nlo , which are estimated by varying @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 by a factor 2 up and down relative to their default values .    in ref .",
    ", we performed a global fit to high - quality data of inclusive unpolarized @xmath0 production , comprising a total of 194 data points from 26 data sets .",
    "specifically , these included @xmath8 distributions in hadroproduction from phenix@xcite at rhic , cdf at tevatron  i@xcite and ii,@xcite atlas,@xcite cms,@xcite alice,@xcite and lhcb@xcite at the lhc ; @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 distributions in photoproduction from h1@xcite and zeus@xcite at hera  i and h1@xcite at hera  ii ; a @xmath61 distribution in two - photon scattering from delphi@xcite at lep  ii ; and a total cross section in @xmath5 annihilation from belle@xcite at kekb . denoting the photon , proton , and @xmath0 four - momenta by @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , respectively , @xmath67 is the @xmath68 center - of - mass energy and @xmath69 is the inelasticity variable measuring the fraction of the photon energy passed on to the @xmath0 meson in the proton rest frame .",
    "we excluded from our fit all data points of two - photon scattering with @xmath70  gev and of hadroproduction with @xmath71  gev , which can not be successfully described by our fixed - order calculations as expected .",
    "the fit results for the co ldmes obtained at nlo in nrqcd with default scale choices are collected in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "they depend only feebly on the precise locations of the @xmath8 cuts .",
    "our calculations refer to direct @xmath0 production , as the data from tevatron  i@xcite do , while the data from tevatron  ii,@xcite lhc,@xcite and kekb@xcite comprise prompt events and those from rhic,@xcite hera,@xcite and lep  ii@xcite even non - prompt ones .",
    "the fit results obtained neglecting the effects due to these admixtures are listed in the second column of table  [ tab : fit ] ( set a ) .",
    "however , the resulting error is small against our theoretical uncertainties and has no effect on our conclusions .",
    "in fact , the fraction of @xmath0 events originating from the feed - down of heavier charmonia only amounts to about 36% for hadroproduction,@xcite 15% for photoproduction at hera,@xcite 9% for two - photon scattering at lep  ii,@xcite and 26% for @xmath5 annihilation at kekb,@xcite and the fraction of @xmath0 events from @xmath29 decays is negligible rhic , hera,@xcite and lep  ii@xcite energies . refitting the data with the estimated feed - down contributions",
    "subtracted yields the values listed in the third column of table  [ tab : fit ] ( set b ) .",
    "the @xmath72 values per data point achieved by the two fits , which are specified as @xmath73 in table  [ tab : fit ] , are to be taken with a grain of salt , since they do not take into account the theoretical uncertainties , which exceed most of the experimental errors .",
    "the fact that the global fit@xcite successfully pins down the three co ldmes as it does is quite nontrivial by itself and establishes their universality , the more so as the long - standing difficulty of nrqcd to describe the photoproduction data at large values of @xmath63 is overcome . furthermore ,",
    "their values are of order @xmath20 with respect to the cs ldme @xmath74})\\rangle$],@xcite in compliance with the velocity scaling rules.@xcite both observations consolidate the validity of nrqcd factorization as far as the unpolarized @xmath0 yield is concerned .    ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , all data sets fitted to are compared with our default nlo nrqcd results ( solid lines ) . for comparison ,",
    "also the default results at lo ( dashed lines ) as well as those of the csm at nlo ( dot - dashed lines ) and lo ( dotted lines ) are shown . in order to visualize the size of the nlo corrections to the hard - scattering cross sections ,",
    "the lo predictions are evaluated with the same ldmes and pdfs .",
    "the yellow and blue ( shaded ) bands indicate the theoretical errors on the nlo nrqcd and csm results .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] that the experimental data are nicely described by nlo nrqcd , being almost exclusively contained within its error bands , while they overshoot the nlo csm predictions typically by 12 orders of magnitude for hadroproduction and a factor of 35 for photoproduction .",
    "in contrast to the lo analysis of ref .  , the delphi data@xcite tend to systematically overshoot the nlo nrqcd result , albeit the deviation is by no means significant in view of the sizable experimental errors .",
    "this may be attributed to the destructive interference of the @xmath21}$ ] and @xmath23}$ ] contributions , which is a genuine nlo phenomenon .",
    "we have to bear in mind , however , that the delphi measurement comprises only 16 events with @xmath75  gev and has not been confirmed by any of the other three lep  ii experiments .",
    "the belle measurement , @xmath76  pb,@xcite is compatible both with the nlo nrqcd and csm results , @xmath77  pb and @xmath78  pb , respectively .",
    "however , the measured cross section was actually obtained from a data sample with the multiplicity of charged tracks in the events being larger than four , and corrections for the effect of this requirement were not performed , so that the value quoted in ref .",
    "just gives a lower bound on the cross section .",
    "three data sets not included in the global fit,@xcite from hadroproduction and from photoproduction in the fixed - target and colliding - beam modes , are nicely reproduced by our nlo nrqcd predictions , as may be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : atlasftps ] and [ fig : zeus ] .",
    "they were taken by the atlas collaboration@xcite at the lhc , by denby et al.@xcite at the fermilab tagged - photon spectrometer , and by the zeus collaboration@xcite at hera  ii .",
    "the @xmath73 values evaluated using our default nlo nrqcd predictions read 10.74 , is omitted . ]",
    "0.40 , and 7.50 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that nrqcd factorization passes this nontrivial test , which , in the case of refs .  , probes kinematic regions far outside those covered by the global fit.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as for the unpolarized @xmath0 yield , nrqcd factorization was consolidated at nlo by a global fit to the world s data of hadroproduction , photoproduction , two - photon scattering , and @xmath5 annihilation,@xcite which successfully pinned down the three co ldmes in compliance with the velocity scaling rules and impressively supported their universality . in a second step ,",
    "nlo nrqcd predictions of @xmath0 polarization observables in various reference frames were confronted with measurements in photoproduction at hera and hadroproduction at the tevatron and the lhc . in the case of hadroproduction at the tevatron , the prediction of strongly transverse @xmath0 polarization in the helicity frame stands in severe contrast to the precise cdf  ii measurement,@xcite which found the @xmath0 mesons to be unpolarized . using the co ldme sets recently extracted from hadroproduction data by two other groups@xcite does not help us to reach a satisfactory description of all the available precision data .",
    "thus , we conclude that the universality of the @xmath0 production ldmes is challenged .",
    "possible remedies include the following :    the eagerly awaited @xmath0 polarization measurements at the lhc might not confirm the cdf  ii results .",
    "although unlikely , measurements at a future @xmath3 collider , such as the lhec,@xcite might reveal that the @xmath8 distribution of @xmath0 photoproduction exhibits a drastically weaker slope beyond @xmath79  gev , the reach of hera , so that the ldme sets of refs .   might yield better agreement with the data there .",
    "the assumption that the @xmath10 expansion is convergent might not be valid for charmonium , leaving the possibility that the ldme universality is intact .",
