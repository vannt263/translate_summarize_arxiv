    "zinc oxide has been the subject of considerable experimental and theoretical investigation for many years.@xcite  its bandgap is in the near ultraviolet , making it useful as a transparent conductor and as sunscreen .",
    "its piezoelectricity opens up transduction applications .",
    "the activity has intensified more recently because of the possibility that zno might be useful for spintronics or spin - based quantum computation .",
    "it has been predicted to be a room - temperature ferromagnet when doped with mn.@xcite  furthermore , its spin - orbit coupling is generally thought to be very weak compared with gaas .",
    "the usual measure of the strength of spin - orbit coupling in semiconductors is the energy splitting at the top of the valence band .",
    "it is said that the spin - orbit coupling is negligible in zno because the valence - band splitting is @xmath1 mev,@xcite as opposed to @xmath2 mev for gaas .",
    "smaller spin - orbit coupling should lead to long spin relaxation times .",
    "long relaxation times are required if spin information is to be transported over appreciable distances .",
    "the spin relaxation time @xmath0 has been measured by ghosh et al .",
    "@xcite to be about 20 ns from 0 to 20 k in optical orientation experiments .",
    "@xmath0 is sometimes called @xmath3 even in the absence of an external field . since the data from ref . ( ) used in this paper were taken at zero field , the relaxation time is taken to be @xmath0 to avoid confusion with experiments conducted at finite field .",
    "the data show two surprising features .",
    "first , the relaxation times are actually somewhat shorter than the longest relaxation times in gaas , which are about 100 ns.@xcite  one might expect the opposite given the relative strength of spin - orbit coupling in the two materials .",
    "second , @xmath0 shows a non - monotonic temperature dependence , first increasing slightly and then rapidly decreasing - but increasing temperature usually promotes spin relaxation .    in this paper",
    ", we show that a theory previously developed for @xmath0 in gaas @xcite can account for these observations .",
    "the theory must be modified to take account of the different impurity levels and binding energies of zno .",
    "this is important , because , in spite of intensive investigation , the nature of the impurities that govern the electrical properties of zno remains controversial , and our analysis sheds some light on this issue .",
    "even more interestingly , it turns out that the wurtzite crystal structure has very important consequences for the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) @xcite scattering that dominates the relaxation at higher temperatures .",
    "thus the crystal structure must be taken into account fully .",
    "the final message will be that the weak  spin - orbit coupling of zno is not negligible for spin relaxation , and it does not lead to long relaxation times .     in the next section",
    "we give the background information for zno .",
    "iii is devoted to a derivation of the equations of motion for the spins .  in sec .",
    "iv the computational method is described .",
    "the determination of the parameters in the equations of motion is a separate task .",
    "the most important of the parameters is that which controls that dp spin relaxation .  since the calculation of this parameters is not straightforward , we devote sec .",
    "v to that .",
    "vi gives the results .",
    "vii is the conclusions and puts the results into context .",
    "in zno produced by the hydrothermal method , it is generally thought that there are two sets of impurity states , one shallow and quasi - hydrogenic , one deep and very well localized.@xcite  their precise physical nature is not known .  in the case of the deep impurity , it is believed that a lattice defect accompanies the chemical impurity .",
    "the binding energies are in the range of a few 10s of mev for the shallow impurity and a few 100s of mev for the deep impurity .",
    "we shall demonstrate below that the optical orientation data can put bounds on these numbers .",
    "zno crystallizes in the wurtzite structure rather than the zincblende structure familiar from the iii - v compounds .",
    "this has very important implications for the conduction band states .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy in the conduction band .",
    "in zincblende structures crystal symmetry implies that the splitting is cubic in the magnitude of the wavevector @xmath4 , but in the wurtzite structure the splitting is linear.@xcite  however , the spin relaxation time of the low - lying conduction band states depends mainly on the spin splitting near the conduction band minimum , and this is larger in zno than in gaas for small enough @xmath4 .    in optical orientation experiments ,",
    "electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band by circularly polarized light tuned close to the bandgap energy ( pump step ) .",
    "the population of conduction electrons so created is spin - polarized.@xcite  energy relaxation then occurs on a short time scale ( @xmath5 ns ) , but most of this relaxation is from spin - conserving processes , so there is a longer time scale ( or time scales ) on which the spin of the system relaxes .  when an external magnetic field is present , the time scale to relax the transverse component of the _ net _ magnetization",
    "is called @xmath0 .",
    "it is measured using faraday rotation or the kerr effect ( probe step ) .",
    "the important physical point is that the fast energy relaxation leads to a thermal charge distribution for the electrons by the time 1 ns has elapsed , but the spin distribution relaxes on longer time scales .",
    "the thermal charge distribution means that the localized donor impurity states are mostly full at the relatively low temperatures of the experiment .",
    "the spins of the localized electrons must be included along with the conduction electron spins .",
    "the spins of localized and extended states can be interchanged by the exchange coupling , a process we call cross- relaxation .",
    "this is often a rather fast process and is particularly important when the relaxation times of the localized and extended states are very different in magnitude .  in gaas",
    "this process is important in all the regimes of temperature , applied field , and impurity density that have been studied , and it is important in zno as well .    in the following section we derive a set of modified bloch equations to describe the aforementioned spin dynamics .",
    "we consider a conduction electron in the semiclassical approximation .",
    "it moves as a wavepacket with a well - defined momentum and scatters from impurities and phonons at time intervals of average length @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the momentum relaxation time .",
    "its spin operator is @xmath8 the spin - dependent part of its hamiltonian in the absence of an external magnetic field is : @xmath9 the first term , @xmath10 , is the exchange interaction with impurity spins @xmath11 located at an positions @xmath12 .",
    "it is the same interaction that is responsible for the kondo effect , but the temperatures here are all much greater than the kondo temperature .",
    "the range of the function @xmath13 is roughly @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the effective bohr radius .",
    "the second term , @xmath16 , represents other spin relaxation mechanisms that we model as a small random classical field @xmath17 with a correlation time much shorter than @xmath0 .",
    "an analogous hamiltonian @xmath18 can be written for a localized electron .",
    "first , we concentrate on the spin dynamics resulting from the spin - spin term and ignore the second term . in the dilute limit ( @xmath19 ) , a conduction electron encounters impurities with randomly aligned spins if no short - range order is present in the impurity system . an effective field from the impurity spin affects the conduction electron when it is within @xmath20 of the impurity .",
    "when @xmath21 , the conduction electron proceeds unhindered by the effective field .",
    "this effective field is a result of the exchange potential .",
    "an itinerant electron will spend an average time of @xmath22 within the range of the effective field where @xmath23 is the velocity of the electron .",
    "thus the time between encounters@xcite is @xmath24 .    in a semiclassical picture",
    "the spin of the itinerant electron undergoes precession of magnitude @xmath25 through a random angle during each encounter with an impurity .",
    "the spin of the impurity electron also precesses but with angle @xmath26 . since the sum of spins , @xmath27 , commutes with @xmath28 , the total spin in the system",
    "must be conserved .",
    "however the spin in each subsystem may shift between one another ; this is cross - relaxation .",
    "it turns out for the parameters of the system under consideration that @xmath29 , and we then find that @xmath30 which implies that the spin is essentially randomized after one impurity encounter .    if we consider an ensemble of conduction electrons with a net magnetization @xmath31 , this magnetization is exchanged at a rate of @xmath32 . as previously mentioned , any magnetization lost from the conduction electrons must be gained by the localized electrons and vice - versa . for clarity",
    "we write @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",

    "similar expressions for the localized magnetization @xmath63 can be found : @xmath64 .    by combining the effects of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ,",
    "the modified bloch equations for the magnetizations can be expressed as @xmath67 for two spin systems - itinerant and localized spins . @xmath54 and @xmath68 in eq .",
    "( [ bloch0 ] ) are now described in terms of well known relaxation mechanisms which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "this model was successfully applied to gaas.@xcite for zno , these bloch equations are easily extended to account for the multiple - type impurities present .",
    "we now seek to write equations like those of eq .",
    "( [ bloch0 ] ) with regard given to the two types of impurities in zno - shallow and deep .",
    "as mentioned above , we find that the cross - relaxation is important to understand the data .",
    "these rates come from the kondo - like @xmath69 interaction between an impurity spin @xmath70 and a conduction band spin @xmath71 .",
    "an expression for @xmath72 in terms of tight - binding parameters can be derived using the schrieffer - wolf transformation.@xcite  one expects that the cross - relaxation between conduction and shallow donor electrons to be much more rapid than the cross - relaxation between conduction and deep donor electrons because of the greater binding energy of the deep impurity and its larger on - site coulomb energy .",
    "this is confirmed by the fit to the data .",
    "in fact we find that terms involving cross - relaxation between the deep donors and either the conduction band electrons or the shallow donor electrons can be neglected . with these simplifications , for zno eq .",
    "( [ bloch0 ] ) extends to @xmath73 in this equation , @xmath74 @xmath75 and @xmath76 stand for the magnetizations of the conduction electrons , the electrons on shallow impurities , and the electrons on deep impurities , respectively .  the @xmath77 s denote the corresponding volume densities .",
    "each of the populations has a relaxation time @xmath78 and @xmath79 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : blochsimp ] ) , we can then find the magnetization as a function of time .",
    "standard methods can be used to solve these differential equations .",
    "the solutions yield a time dependence of the total magnetization , @xmath80 , to be a sum of three exponentials , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 where @xmath84 with @xmath85 given by @xmath86 no net moment can exist on the deep donor sites since no moment is excited into the deep states on account of them being significantly below the conduction band , and no net moment cross relaxes into these states .",
    "therefore @xmath87 can be ruled out as being the observed relaxation rate . in the regime",
    "that @xmath88 , the rate @xmath89 simplifies to @xmath90 and is very rapid and the rate @xmath91 is slower , @xmath92 we fit the data with this equation and associate it with @xmath0 .",
    "we see that the relaxation rate depends on two factors : the thermodynamic occupations of the shallow donors ( the deep donors are always nearly full in the temperature range studied here ) and form of the relaxation rates for the conduction and localized shallow states .",
    "the densities can be computed using standard formulas from equilibrium statistical mechanics , since we deal only with time scales long compared to the fast energy relaxation scale .  as a function of temperature @xmath93",
    ", the ratio @xmath94 naturally increases rapidly as @xmath95 is so large that these states are always occupied at the experimental temperatures , which range from 5k to 80k .",
    "@xmath54 is fairly complicated to calculate because there are several mechanisms that can relax the conduction electron spins .",
    "the simplest such mechanism is the elliot - yafet ( ey ) process@xcite that arises from spin mixing in the wavefunctions .",
    "when a conduction electron is scattered by a spin - independent potential from state @xmath96 to state @xmath97 , the initial and final states are not eigenstates of the spin projection operator @xmath98 so the process relaxes the spin .",
    "the rate of relaxation due to the ey process is well known to be of the form : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a material dependent parameter and @xmath7 is the momentum relaxation time.@xcite we estimate @xmath101 k@xmath102 .",
    "the bir - aronov - pikus ( bap ) mechanism@xcite arises from the scattering of electron and holes .",
    "this relaxation mechanism is commonly considered to be negligible in @xmath77-type materials like those under consideration here since the number of holes is small.@xcite  the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism @xcite arises from the ordinary scattering of conduction - band states .",
    "since this has not previously been calculated in a wurtzite structure , we devote the next section to it .",
    "this calculation yields an expression for @xmath54 as a function of temperature .",
    "@xmath103 and @xmath104 are due to non - spin - conserving anisotropic exchange ( dzyaloshinski - moriya ) interactions.@xcite the anisotropic exchange term is important . it arises from spin - orbit coupling and produces a term proportional to @xmath105 where @xmath106 is related to the interspin separation and the exchange integral between the wavefunction on sites 1 and 2 .",
    "however , it is not possible to calculate it in detail when the nature of the impurities is not well known .",
    "we estimate the rate as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the total impurity concentrations of the shallow and deep impurity respectively and @xmath110 has a weak temperature dependence that we neglect .",
    "the main contribution comes from the the overlap of the shallow impurity wavefunctions , which we take to be hydrogenic , with the deep impurity wavefunctions , which we take to be well - localized on an atomic scale .",
    "the details of how to estimate the resulting relaxation may be found in refs .",
    "the numerical value we find from theory is @xmath111 @xmath112 ns@xmath113 .",
    "when nuclei possess nonzero magnetic moments , the hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spin is a source of spin relaxation for localized electrons.@xcite however , zero nuclear spin isotopes of zn and o are 96% and 99.5% naturally abundant respectively .",
    "therefore we rule out the hyperfine interaction from being an observed relaxation mechanism in ref .",
    "the conduction band states undergo ordinary impurity and phonon scattering .",
    "each scattering event give a change in the wavevector @xmath96 , which in turn changes the effective magnetic field on the spin that comes from spin - orbit coupling .",

    "in fig.1 we show that temperature dependence of @xmath0 as measured in a bulk zno sample and our fit ( using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) ) to the data .",
    "it is seen immediately that the temperature dependence is not monotonic and that this is well - reproduced by the theory .",
    "the reason is simple .  at low temperatures @xmath154 nearly all the electrons are in localized states .",
    "these states relax by the temperature - independent dm  mechanism : @xmath155 .",
    "this mechanism alone determines the @xmath156 values .",
    "when @xmath93 approaches @xmath157 the deep impurities are all occupied but the rest of the population is shared by shallow localized and conduction band states .",
    "initially , the conduction band electrons have a longer spin lifetime because impurity scattering is frequent at low temperatures so the dp mechanism that relaxes them is not very effective",
    ". however , the dp mechanism increases rapidly as @xmath93 increases and the @xmath0 curve turns around .  at @xmath158",
    "the shallow impurity level is empty and the relaxation is dominated by the dp mechanism in the conduction band : @xmath159 .    at this point",
    "it is necessary to point out why only the linear - in-@xmath93 dp mechanism is needed to explain the observed conduction spin relaxation .",
    "the other two viable candidates ( cubic dp and ey ) for relaxation are much too weak to explain the observed relaxation times in zno .",
    "we use the calculated values for @xmath160 and @xmath161 in the previous section to obtain the relative relaxation efficiencies between the linear and cubic dp mechanism terms : @xmath162 which demonstrates that the efficiency of the cubic - in-@xmath93 term does not become comparable to the linear - in-@xmath93 term at temperatures below @xmath163 k which is far above the temperature range investigated here .",
    "in fact the cubic - in-@xmath93 term does not even reach one - tenth the efficiency of the linear - in-@xmath93 term in the temperature range investigated here .",
    "for this reason we can confidently ignore the cubic - in-@xmath93 dp mechanism term in our fit .",
    "the crystal structure of zno therefore makes its spin relaxation qualitatively different from spin relaxation in bulk @xmath77-gaas .",
    "we also compare the efficiencies of the dp and ey mechanisms : @xmath164 even if the momentum relaxation time taken to be unrealistically low , say @xmath165 fs , the dp mechanism is still nearly two orders of magnitude more efficient at relaxing spins than the ey mechanism in the temperature range studied here . due to the drastic qualitative and quantitative differences between relaxation mechanisms",
    ", we have unequivocally determined the relevant conduction electron spin relaxation mechanism in zno .",
    "[ fig : plot ]    the fit of theory to the experimental data is clearly very good .",
    "we found that no reasonable fit was possible using only a single impurity level , though this worked very well for gaas @xcite , so we used two levels .",
    "a good fit by this method was possible by adjusting the coefficients @xmath166 and @xmath167 and the binding energies @xmath168 and concentrations @xmath169 of the two donors , subject to the constraint that the room temperature carrier density should equal the measured@xcite value of @xmath170 cm@xmath153 .",
    "qualitatively , one finds that @xmath172 and @xmath173 to get the right order of magnitude of the relaxation at low @xmath174  physically , the deep impurity spins are important because they relax the shallow impurity spins by the dm mechanism , and the strength of the low @xmath93 relaxation implies that the deep impurities must be quite numerous .",
