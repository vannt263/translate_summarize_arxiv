    "in ref . @xcite a classically constrained general relativity ( cgr ) was discussed .",
    "the gravitational part of the lagrangian density consists of the conventional einstein - hilbert ( eh ) term amended by a term that enforces a constraint = -2 ( r+2 ) - g^__+  .",
    "[ lagr ] here @xmath0 is a non - dynamical lagrange multiplier field , and we introduced a cosmological constant @xmath1 . in most of the applications discussed below , @xmath1 can be replaced by a `` slow roll '' inflationary potential @xmath2 , as @xmath3 ( we put @xmath4 ) .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) is a part of the action used in path - integral quantization of gr .",
    "the lagrange multiplier term usually enforces the gauge fixing condition . for consistent quantization of small fluctuations",
    "this lagrangian should be amended by appropriate boundary conditions for the fluctuations , and by the faddeev - popov ( fp ) ghosts .",
    "the main point of the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , which we follow here , was to allow for the boundary conditions on which the determinant of the fp operator has a zero - mode .",
    "this would make the path integral ill - defined , unless the zero - mode is treated separately from the fluctuations .",
    "the zero - mode is regarded as a classical background solution , and the small fluctuations are then quantized about that background . in ref .",
    "@xcite we considered only the background solutions on which the fp ghosts vanish , although they are present as quantum fluctuations .",
    "the above approach , when it comes to classical solutions , reduces to the following simple algorithm . considering ( [ lagr ] ) as a classically constrained theory . in this theory ,",
    "einstein s equations are modified due to the @xmath0 field .",
    "the modified equations could allow for new solutions @xcite that are absent in gr . to discuss those solutions we consider spaces with boundaries where the gibbons - hawking term @xcite is implied and the following boundary conditions are imposed : @xmath5 . then , the equations of motion take the form : g_+(__+__)- g^__g_&= & g _ , [ eq1 ] + _ ( g^)&=&0 . [ gauge ]",
    "the above equations can admit solutions that are not present in gr .",
    "for instance , a theory with @xmath6 has a solution with zero space - time curvature @xcite : @xmath7 .",
    "the solution ends on a fixed boundary where the value of @xmath0 , which is defined up to a constant , is adjusted to be zero so that the space is geodesically complete . we will call this a new flat solution below . on the other hand ,",
    "putting @xmath8 , the theory yields a conventional ( anti)de sitter solution written in a gauge ( [ gauge ] ) @xcite .",
    "there are also other solutions , one of them being a zero - energy spatially - flat de sitter ( ds ) space with a boundary , that we will discuss below in some detail .",
    "the goal of the present work is to study these solutions and their relevance to cosmology . as a first example",
    ", we will look at a new possibility to create a universe into a state described by the _ spatially - flat _ ds solution .",
    "that quantum creation of a spatially - flat universe is possible if it has non - trivial topology , was first found by zeldovich and starobinsky @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the spatially - flat universe that is being created has trivial topology , but comes with a fixed boundary on which the boundary conditions preserving completeness of the space are imposed .",
    "we calculate the probability of creation of such a universe out of `` nothing '' , i.e. , out of an initial state with no classical space - time .",
    "linde s @xcite and vilenkin s ( first reference in @xcite ) approaches give the same results in this case .",
    "we will find that the probabilistic arguments favor initial conditions needed for inflation , as opposed to the conditions that would favor universe sitting at the bottom of the potential .",
    "however , the probability itself is still exponentially small .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the emergence of a _ closed _ ds universe in a conventional approach @xcite .",
    "then we turn to a new flat solution described above .",
    "we study a process of producing a small region of primordial universe in a state of a nonzero energy described by the new flat solution .",
    "as we will see , in the minisuperspace approximation , there is no potential barrier to be penetrated in order to fluctuate into this state .",
    "interestingly enough , if @xmath1 is positive , this state is unstable  it can either collapse or with an almost equal probability , can rapidly transition into a spatially - flat ds universe with @xmath9 .",
    "the latter can be used to describe the required inflationary epoch .",
    "the above sequence of events , represents a new channel for obtaining an inflationary region in a primordial universe .",
    "the probability of these events to take place is not suppressed by the exponential factors . in that regard ,",
    "the effect is similar to the one emphasized by linde @xcite , in the context of the solution of @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath10 , then the new flat solution is stable .",
    "can this be used at late times for the adjustment of the cosmological constant ?",
    "one could be contemplating a scenario in which a small region in a primordial universe first fluctuates into a state described by the new flat solution with a positive potential ( positive @xmath1 ) , then undergoes inflation as described above , and after that the potential drops to a negative value @xmath10 .",
    "one could use the new flat solution with @xmath10 to obtain an ( almost ) flat universe today via this sequence .",
    "we will briefly comment on what it takes to have such a scenario .",
    "before we turn to quantum cosmology of cgr , we would like to make a few comment concerning the consistency of the theory ( [ lagr ] ) itself ( this was discussed in detail in @xcite , here we just briefly summarize some main results ) :    the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) is not reparametrization invariant ",
    "the new term completely restricts the symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , the equivalence principle is preserved . the gauge condition ( [ gauge ] )",
    "allows _ local _ , point - dependent gauge transformations , that can be used to eliminate a nontrivial metric and connection in an infinitesimal neighborhood of any space - time point .",
    "the linearized theory has two propagating physical polarizations of a graviton .",
    "no negative - norm states or tachyons appear in the quadratic action .",
    "bianchi identities enforce an additional condition on the lagrange multiplier : @xmath11 .",
    "the latter has to be respected by all solutions of the theory .",
    "conventional solutions of gr ( the schwarzschild solution etc .",
    ", ) are also solutions of cgr .",
    "this is because the above solutions can be transformed to a gauge where ( [ gauge ] ) is fulfilled , and putting @xmath8 , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is also satisfied .",
    "the structure of the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) is not ruined by quantum loop corrections since for small fluctuations on a given background it can be completed to a brst invariant form introducing the faddeev - popov ghost .",
    "the latter do not affect the classical solutions that we discuss .",
    "computations in quantum cosmology are primarily performed in a minisuperspace approximation ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we develop a minisuperspace approach to cgr .",
    "the metric for a spatially - flat universe in this approach takes the form : ds^2 = n^2(t ) dt^2 -a^2(t)_ijdx^i dx^j .",
    "[ eq : mini_metric ] here both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of @xmath14 only , and @xmath15 .",
    "one difference from the conventional approach is that we will be working with general @xmath12 not necessarily equal to the unity .",
    "we will show that @xmath12 is determined by @xmath13 because of the constraint .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian density ( [ lagr ] ) takes the form : @xmath16 -2\\left(\\frac{a^3}{n}\\right)\\dot\\lambda_0 + 2an\\nabla\\cdot\\vec\\lambda,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 as a part of the rules of the minisuperspace reduction we require that @xmath19 s are time independent functions of spatial coordinates @xmath20 only .",
    "this rule is justified by the complete hamiltonian description of the theory ( [ lagr ] ) which is given in the appendix [ app : hamiltonian ] .",
    "one can check that solutions to such a theory only exist when @xmath21 is a function of the time coordinate @xmath14 alone , and @xmath22 is a space - time constant .",
    "it is straightforward to find the hamiltonian density . for the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath13",
    ", we obtain @xmath23 . moreover , @xmath24 the above relations represent two primary constraints of the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "note that we are not introducing a conjugate momentum for @xmath25 , since it is assumed to be time independent , and , therefore non - dynamical .",
    "a more rigorous treatment is given in the appendix [ app : hamiltonian ] .",
    "the total hamiltonian density takes the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are lagrange multipliers enforcing the primary constraints .",
    "due to the hamiltonian equations of motion @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "requiring that the time variation of the two primary constraints vanishes , we obtain the equations of motion for the inexpressible velocities @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] as it could be checked directly , no further constraints emerge . on the surface of the existing constraints we can simplify the hamiltonian density @xmath34",
    "let us discuss classical solutions of such a theory first . from we find that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "as we discussed already @xmath37 is also a constant . from equation",
    "we find @xmath38 since both @xmath39 and @xmath40 itself commute with @xmath40 , so does @xmath32 .",
    "hence , for @xmath41 we get that @xmath42 , which is a constant if @xmath43 is an eigenvalue ( energy density ) of @xmath40 .    for further convenience",
    "we introduce the `` conformal time '' @xmath44 then , the equations of motion can be expressed in the following familiar form : ( ) ^2 + ka^2 = 3 - b 6 a^6 , + =3 + , where @xmath45 .",
    "interestingly , in these equations the quantity @xmath46 plays the role similar to a three - dimensional spatial curvature of gr .",
    "additional terms on the r.h.s .",
    "are also due to the @xmath0 field .",
    "these terms act as a fluid with the equation of state @xmath47 .",
    "unlike other dynamical fields , there are no fluctuations of @xmath0 .",
    "we will consider the following three solutions of the equations of motion :    1 .",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath49 , one finds a spatially flat inflating solution , where the scale factor @xmath13 , as a function of conformal time @xmath50 , is identical to that of a closed ds universe ; 2 .",
    "@xmath51 and @xmath52 , one finds a flat minkowski space - time in spite of the fact that @xmath53 .",
    "this is the new flat solution described in the previous section .",
    "we consider two physically different cases : @xmath54 and @xmath10 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath55 , gives a conventional , spatially - flat inflating de sitter space - time .",
    "below we will study physical consequences of these solutions",
    ". corresponds to a positive energy density of the fluid . in general , on certain solutions @xmath56 could also take a positive sign producing a negative energy density fluid .",
    "however , this should not be a concern since the @xmath0 field , that give rise to this fluid , is not dynamical and does not fluctuate . ]",
    "we now turn to the quantum mechanics of the hamiltonian density given by . to do so we promote all the fields in to operators with the prescription @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the lagrangian is an integral of the density @xmath59 over the entire space on each time slice . to make the integral converge",
    ", we will be discussing a three - dimensionally flat space with a finite - size spatial boundary .",
    "then , the integral @xmath60 is finite , and @xmath61 denotes a spatial `` comoving volume '' on each time slice and is a fixed number .",
    "the physical 3-volume is @xmath62 .",
    "so far we have ignored the factor @xmath63 in the action . restoring this factor",
    ", the hamiltonian reads @xmath64 let us now suppose that @xmath65 is an eigenstate of @xmath66 with an energy eigenvalue @xmath67 . as we discussed in the previous section ,",
    "both @xmath68 and @xmath22 commute with @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , one can always choose @xmath65 to be an eigenstate of the above two operators with eigenvalues @xmath36 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "on such a state , one can replace the operator @xmath12 by @xmath70 , and @xmath22 by @xmath69 . therefore , most generically , we are looking for states @xmath71 where @xmath72 represents the eigenstate of the operator @xmath13 with eigenvalue @xmath73 , and etc .. the `` wave - function '' @xmath74 is determined by the wheeler - de witt equation @xmath75\\psi(a)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath76 , and we have ignored the operator ordering ambiguity .",
    "the solution of this equation is equivalent to the wave - function of a particle with zero energy moving in a one - dimensional potential .",
    "let us look now at a probability of creation of the universe `` from nothing '' , i.e. , from a state with no classical space - time .",
    "the solution describing this state should have zero energy @xmath77 . in this case",
    "the minisuperspace potential @xmath78 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zero ] .",
    "it has a classically forbidden region @xmath79 , and a de - sitter region @xmath80 .    to calculate the probability of tunneling of the system from @xmath81 to @xmath82 we follow vilenkin s tunneling wave - function approach ( first reference in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "approach @xcite , although conceptually different , gives the same answer in this case .",
    "taking the trace of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) we easily find the action on the tunneling solutions @xmath83 and , introducing the euclidean time @xmath84 , we find @xmath85 although this looks similar to the result in conventional quantum cosmology for the action of a closed ds universe , there is an essential difference .",
    "the comoving volume @xmath61 is not fixed by the value of the cosmological constant @xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "if we are to maximize the probability of tunneling by creating a smallest size universe , then @xmath61 is only to be bounded by the plank scale .",
    "however , there is the following consideration to be taken into account",
    ". the fate of the universe after creation will depend on the boundary conditions chosen .",
    "for the universe created out of `` nothing '' we assume simple ones that the boundary surface has no tension , and that there is no exterior space - time . moreover ,",
    "we adjust the value of the @xmath86 field on the boundary so that the space is complete ( this is possible because the @xmath0 field enters only linearly trough its first derivative in the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) ) . such a universe , to continue its inflationary expansion , should have a size bigger or equal to the scale of its ds horizon @xmath87 , otherwise it would collapse @xcite .",
    "this puts a lower bound on the size of an acceptable initial universe @xmath88 .",
    "for @xmath89 we get that @xmath90 and the quasi - classical arguments are well applicable . for a given value of @xmath1 , the tunneling probability can be calculated using a conserved `` klein - gordon '' current @xmath91 @xcite , and takes the form @xmath92",
    ". the latter will be maximized by a smallest acceptable value of @xmath93 .",
    "this gives a results similar to the probability of creation of a closed ds universe in the tunneling approach @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "however , as was emphasized above , in the present context the created universe has zero spatial curvature , while in the conventional approach only a closed ds universe can be materialized `` from nothing '' .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the created universe is clear",
    ". it will inflate and redshift away the contribution of the @xmath86 field that played the role of the spatial - curvature during the creation .",

    "this would favor a creation of an inflationary universe of a huge size .",
    "the above prescription is similar to the hartle - hawking ( hh ) approach @xcite because of the euclidean continuation ( it also somewhat differs from the hh no - boundary proposal since our solution has a boundary ) .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the obtained result has an interpretation of a probability of creation of a universe form `` nothing '' .",

    "some results of the present section are similar to those of @xcite obtained for topologically nontrivial compact universes @xcite .    in the minisuperspace approach the above solution",
    "is described by @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the total energy of the solution is non - zero .",

    "fluctuations in the system will destabilize this state .",
