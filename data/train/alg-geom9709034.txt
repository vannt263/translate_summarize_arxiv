    "a fundamental open problem in the theory of schubert polynomials is to find an analog of the littlewood - richardson rule . by this , we mean a bijective description of the structure constants for the ring of polynomials with respect to its basis of schubert polynomials .",
    "such a rule would express the intersection form in the cohomology of a flag manifold in terms of its basis of schubert classes .",
    "other than the classical littlewood - richardson rule ( when the schubert polynomials are schur symmetric polynomials ) little is known .",
    "using geometry , monk  @xcite established a formula for multiplication by linear schubert polynomials ( divisor schubert classes ) . a pieri - type formula for multiplication by an elementary or complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial ( special schubert class )",
    "was given in  @xcite , but only recently proven  @xcite using geometry .",
    "there are now several proofs  @xcite , some of which  @xcite are purely combinatorial .    in the more general",
    "setting of multiplication by a schur symmetric polynomial , formulas for some structure constants follow from a family of identities which were proven using geometry  @xcite . also in ( _ ibid .",
    "_ ) are combinatorial results about intervals in the bruhat order which are formally related to these identities . a combinatorial ( but _ not _ a bijective )",
    "formula was given for these coefficients  @xcite using the pieri formula , which gave a direct connection between some of these order - theoretic results and identities .",
    "a first goal of this paper is to deduce another identity  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  g(_ii _ ) ) from the pieri formula , and also to deduce the pieri formula from these identities .",
    "this furnishes a new proof of the pieri formula , shows its equivalence to these ( seemingly ) more general identities , and , together with the combinatorial proofs of the pieri formula , gives a purely combinatorial proof of these identities .",
    "a key step is the definition of a symmetric function associated to any finite _ symmetric labeled poset _ , which is a poset whose hasse diagram has edges labeled with integers with a symmetry condition satisfied by its maximal chains .",
    "this gives a unified construction of skew schur functions ( for intervals in young s lattice of partitions ) , stanley symmetric functions  @xcite ( for intervals in the weak order on the symmetric group ) , and for intervals in a @xmath0-bruhat order , _ skew schubert functions _ ( defined in another fashion in  1 ) .    in  @xcite , lascoux and schtzenberger show that if a schubert polynomial is expressed as a univariate polynomial in the first variable , then the coefficients are ( explicitly determined ) multiplicity - free sums of schubert polynomials in the remaining variables .",
    "this may be used to show that schubert polynomials are sums of monomials with non - negative coefficients .",
    "we use a cohomological formula  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.5.4 ) to generalize their result , obtaining a similar formula for expressing a schubert polynomial as a polynomial in _ any _ variable .",
    "this also extends theorem  c  ( _ ii _ ) of  @xcite , which identified the constant term of this expression . from this",
    ", we obtain a construction of schubert polynomials purely in terms of chains in the bruhat order , and a geometric proof that the monomials which appear in a schubert polynomial have non - negative coefficients .",
    "the pieri formula shows these coefficients are certain intersection numbers , recovering a result of kirillov and maeno  @xcite .",
    "we found these precise formulas in terms of intersection numbers surprising ; other combinatorial constructions are either recursive  @xcite and do not give the coefficients , or are expressed in terms of combinatorial structures ( the weak order on the symmetric group  @xcite or diagrams of permutations  @xcite ) which are not geometric .",
    "previously , we believed this non - negativity of monomials had no relation to geometry .",
    "indeed , only monomials of the form @xmath1 with @xmath2 a partition are represented by positive cycles , other polynomial representatives of schubert classes  @xcite do not have this non - negativity , and polynomial representatives for the other classical groups  can not  @xcite have such non - negativity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 1 ,",
    "we give necessary background , define skew schubert functions , and state our main results . in section 2 , we deduce the pieri formula from the identities and results on the bruhat order .",
    "in section 3 , we define a symmetric function @xmath3 associated to a symmetric labeled poset @xmath4 and complete the proof of the equivalence of the pieri formula and these identities .",
    "we also show how this construction gives skew schur and schubert functions . in section 4",
    ", we adapt an argument of remmel and shimozono  @xcite to show that , for intervals in the weak order , this symmetric function is stanley s symmetric function  @xcite . finally , in section 5",
