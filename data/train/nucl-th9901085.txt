    "recently , the study if the hadron properties changing in nuclear matter environment , such as the effective mass and so on , absorbs much attention @xcite . it is reported that the experiment has shown a significant amount of strength of the dilepton production spectrum below the free @xmath3 meson production threshold@xcite , and this phenomena can be explained by a downshift of the @xmath3 meson mass in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "there have been already a lot of theoretical studies on the effective mass of @xmath3 meson and the light mesons @xmath4 in nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "not only the vector mesons , the effective mass of @xmath5 meson is studied also extensively ( see , e. g. , ref.@xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "the effective mass of meson is related to the collective excitation or dispersion relation of meson in nuclear matter .",
    "we have made a series of study on this subject for @xmath6 meson @xcite and pion@xcite .",
    "the collective excitation spectra of nuclear matter can be obtained by the trajectory of the pole of meson propagators . in vacuum ,",
    "the vacuum fluctuation caused by meson propagation will modify the dispersion relation of a free physical meson . in nuclear matter ,",
    "however , due to the medium effects , the appearance of the dispersion relation or the collective excitation spectra will be very different from that in the vacuum , that is , in addition to the meson branch there will be acoustic sound excitation spectra in the space - like region . the meson branch can be regarded as the usual meson propagation in nuclear matter , it can also be interpreted as a mode of collective excitation which have the same quantum number as the meson .",
    "the acoustic sound spectra , disappears when nuclear density is zero , can only be viewed as the mode of collective excitation of nuclear matter@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will review some of the progress in the studies of the collective excitation in nuclear matter . in the next section",
    ", we will demonstrate the derivation of the relativistic particle - hole ( _ ph _ ) excitation in nuclear matter , then give the dimesonic function and collective excitation spectra of @xmath6 and electromagnetic field . in the 3rd sect . , we will study the spin - isospin dependent collective excitation modes by pion propagator . the relativistic delta - hole ( @xmath2 )",
    "excitation , antiparticle excitations and spin - isospin dependent response function will be studied in the subsections .",
    "finally , we give the summary and conclusions in the last section .",
    "a systematic study of the collective excitation for @xmath7 meson in the walecka model has been given in ref.@xcite .",
    "but as we have pointed out@xcite that the polarization insertion calculated in refs.@xcite , and in other papers does not represent a real _ ph _ excitation neither a particle - antiparticle ( @xmath8 ) excitation , because the nucleon propagator they used is `` feynman '' propagator @xmath9 and `` density dependent '' propagator @xmath10 , instead of particle and hole propagators .",
    "the polarization insertion calculated in that way , includes a finite @xmath8 excitation term which violates pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the reason is that a divergent @xmath8 excitation term is neglected in their calculation . in our approach , however , the @xmath11 and @xmath8 excitations are split up clearly .",
    "the later is divergent and it is usually neglected in the nonrelativistic approach ( see , for example@xcite ) , but it can be taken into account when a appropriate renormalization is made .",
    "we will demonstrate this point in the following by taking the example of pion .      for pseudo - scalar",
    "_ ps _ @xmath12 coupling , the polarization insertion ( _ pi _ ) of pion propagator in _ nm _",
    "@xmath13 ) calculated by using @xmath9 and @xmath10 propagators : g(p ) = g_f(p ) + g_d(p ) @xmath14 @xmath15 is as follows@xcite : @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath17\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is nucleon effective mass in nuclear matter .",
    "@xmath21 is the nucleon distribution function at zero temperature .",
    "the subscripts @xmath22 and @xmath23 in above eqs .",
    "denote feynman part and explicitly density dependent part , respectively .",
    "it is obvious @xmath24 is divergent , it comes from the contribution of two @xmath9 in the integrand of the nucleon loop integration .",
    "people usually omit this term and keep @xmath25 only ( see ref.@xcite , where @xmath12 coupling is pseudo - vector ( _ pv _ ) ) , and tread it as _ ph _ excitation .",
    "later we will see @xmath24 can not be treated as @xmath26 excitation , neither @xmath27 is due to @xmath11 excitation .    on the other hand , @xmath28",
    "can also be expressed as follows@xcite : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 here @xmath33 is antinucleon propagator , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the particle and antiparticle projection operator , respectively . when these propagators are used to calculate _",
    ", the nonvanishing parts will be due to @xmath11 and @xmath26 excitations , they are @xmath36 :    @xmath37    @xmath38,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the factor @xmath40 and @xmath41 in above equations correctly indicated the excitations they belong .",
    "it can be verified that the sum of @xmath42 and @xmath43 is equal to sum of @xmath24 and @xmath27 .",
    "since @xmath42 is not equal to @xmath27 , @xmath43 is not equal to @xmath24 , so @xmath24 does not stand for @xmath26 excitation , neither @xmath27 stands for @xmath11 excitation .",
    "that means , generally speaking , one can not get the correct expressions for @xmath11 and @xmath26 excitation if one uses @xmath44 propagators to calculate _",
    "pi _ in _ nm_. neglecting @xmath45 and retaining @xmath25 only in the calculation is not a matter of approximation or a truncation of a full theory , explicitly speaking it is a wrong formula derived by a incorrect approach .",
    "but that is not the case for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , because they are two independent excitation modes and the later is well known negligible in the nonrelativistic approximation@xcite .",
    "so , we will no longer consider @xmath45 and @xmath25 again in the following formulae and numerical calculations .",
    "the propagation of isoscalar @xmath7 meson in nuclear matter will cause longitudinal and transverse collective excitation .",
    "it is well known that the isoscalar @xmath5 meson will mix with the longitudinal mode of @xmath7 meson@xcite . to study these collective excitation modes , we start from the dimesonic function of nuclear matter@xcite",
    ", it is given as follows : @xmath48 @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    here @xmath52 are the mass of @xmath7 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the last term in @xmath53 is due to @xmath54 mixing , and @xmath55\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath56,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath57,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath58 here @xmath59 are the @xmath60 and @xmath61 coupling constants , respectively , @xmath62 @xmath63    the analytic expression for the real and the imaginary part of @xmath64 is given in ref .",
    "the eigen condition for determining the collective excitation spectra is @xmath65 .",
    "there are three free parameters in the walecka model , that is @xmath66 .",
    "the effective mass of nucleon is given by the condition that the energy per nucleon should be the minimum to the variation of nucleon effective mass .",
    "in ref.@xcite , @xmath67 = 550 mev and @xmath59 are chosen to fit the binding energy of nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath68 = 1.42 @xmath69 .",
    "the results are : in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) @xmath70 = 0.56 , @xmath71 = 9.59 , @xmath72 = 11.7 . in the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha )",
    "@xmath70 = 0.72 , @xmath71 = 7.93 , @xmath72 = 8.94 .",
    "the masses of nucleon and @xmath7 meson are 938.5 mev and 783 mev , respectively . in fig .",
    "1 . we show the results of collective spectra at nuclear saturation density , calculated in the mfa .",
    "there are the meson branches and acoustic sound branch indicated by letters `` s '' and `` l '' , `` t '' which are due to @xmath5 meson , longitudinal and transverse @xmath7 meson .",
    "the longitudinal and transverse mode diverse at large energy and momentum , they are almost overlay for low momentum .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     excitation is different but it is the same for @xmath73 and @xmath74 excitation . for _ ph _ and @xmath2 excitations , the imaginary part is nonvanishing only for a finite energy range , but that is not the case for antiparticle excitations where the imaginary part will not vanish for any energy larger than the threshold , and the corresponding amplitude is much larger than _ ph _ or @xmath2 excitation .",
    "the imaginary part relates to the real part by the dispersion relation @xmath75    for antiparticle excitations , the imaginary part does not vanish for high energy and increases much faster than the denominator , so the integration or the real part is divergent .",
    "our renoralization scheme is to make a form factor correction to the @xmath12 and @xmath76 vertices , ( @xmath77 ) @xmath78 ) , @xmath79 where @xmath80 = 1200 mev , @xmath81 is a free parameter . shown in fig .",
    "6 is the imaginary part of the response function of the charge exchange reaction ( @xmath82 , t ) with t@xmath83 = 2.0 gev @xcite .",
    "we assume the density of the target nucleus is @xmath3 = 0.17 @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the landau - migdal parameter @xmath86 = 0.6 .",
    "we can see that for antiparticle excitation and form factor correction enhance the response function especially at resonance energy at about 260 mev .",
    "increasing cut - off @xmath81 , ( softening of the form factor for high energy ) will increase the antiparticle excitation effect .",
    "we can also see that all three curves start from @xmath87 250 mev which is the threshold of the @xmath2 excitation for @xmath88 = 2.0 gev .",
    "the _ ph _ and @xmath2 , etc . , are the elementary and important excitation modes in nuclear physics which were studied very well in the nonrelativistic case .",
    "we propose a new formalism and applied to the relativistic case successfully . the relativistic _ ph _ , @xmath2 excitations are derived and the nonrelativistic results can be reproduced .",
    "the antiparticle excitations , such as @xmath89 excitation are derived . to our knowledge , we are the first derived the antiparticle excitations . in this paper , we show the application of our formalism to meson propagator propagators only , but in fact , it can be generally applied to any of the processes including the _ pi_. on the other hand , we are going to extend the formalism to finite temperature .",
