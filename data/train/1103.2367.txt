    "theory the diffuse and the specular components describe the correction to the heat flux due to the scattering within only one of the rough surfaces , since both expressions split up into the sum of a term proportional to @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the different scattering processes can be classified as follows : the zeroth - order scattering is the specular scattering of the two flat mean surfaces .",
    "the diffuse component describes the correction to the heat flux for first - order scattering of an incoming wave with lateral wave vector @xmath38 into a wave with @xmath42 . for such scattering processes , incoming s - polarized waves can be scattered into p - polarized waves and propagating waves into evanescent waves and vice versa . on the other hand ,",
    "the specular component describes the correction to the heat flux due to a second - order scattering of an incoming wave with @xmath38 into a wave with @xmath89 , since it describes the scattering of the mean field .",

    "we use the material properties of sic and au for both media with parameters taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and set @xmath92 and @xmath93 . additionally , we choose the surface roughness parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 for @xmath20 , i.e. , we consider a very shallow surface roughness with @xmath96 .",
    "first , we turn to the distance dependence of the roughness correction to the near - field heat transfer . to this aim , we start with a plot of the heat flux between two bodies with flat surfaces in fig .  [ fig : p0 ] ( a ) considering two sic and two au slabs .",
    "sic has a surface phonon resonance , whereas au has no surface plasmon resonance in the infrared region .",
    "one can see that the curves for the sic and the au plates are quite different .",
    "for sic the heat transfer is relatively large in the propagating regime ( @xmath97 for @xmath98 ) due to the low reflectivity of this material and has values close to the black body limit @xmath99 , whereas for au which has a high reflectivity the heat flux is very small . in the evanescent regime ( @xmath100 )",
    "the heat flux is for sic dominated by the p - polarized surface mode contribution giving values which can exceed the black body result by more than 3 orders of magnitude for the here chosen distance regime . on the other hand , for the au plates",
    "the heat flux is dominated by the s - polarized contribution and the large amount of transfered heat can be attributed to induced foucault currents  @xcite . for distances smaller than @xmath101",
    "the curve for sic becomes proportional to @xmath102 which is the well - known result in the quasi - static limit  @xcite .",
    "now , we have a look on the impact of surface roughness . in fig .",
    "[ fig : p0 ] ( b ) we plot the roughness correction to the heat transfer @xmath103 .",
    "first of all , for both materials the roughness correction is positive for all distances so that roughness increases the heat flux with respect to the case of flat surfaces . in the propagating regime",
    "the relative correction is very small ( smaller than @xmath104 percent ) for sic and is limited due to the fact that even if we introduce roughness the overall amount of thermal radiation can not be larger than @xmath105 .",
    "for au the relative correction is one order of magnitude larger , but the absolute correction is still very small , since @xmath106 has values smaller than @xmath107 . in the opposite limit of small distances ,",
    "i.e. , in the evanescent regime the relative correction due to roughness can become large .",
    "for example , for sic the relative correction is about @xmath108 percent for @xmath109 . since for that distance",
    "the heat flux is as large as @xmath110 times the black body value , this is an increase of about @xmath111 times @xmath105 . for the au plates we find a roughness correction of @xmath112 percent for @xmath109 . at this distance @xmath106",
    "is about @xmath113 times the black body value yielding an absolute correction of about @xmath114 times @xmath105 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : proughspecdiff ] we plot the specular and diffuse part of the roughness correction for sic only . keeping in mind that the diffuse part is purely negative in this case , whereas we find that the specular part is purely positive .",
    "it can be seen that for distances larger than @xmath115 the diffuse part is negligibly small compared to the specular one , whereas for distances smaller than @xmath115 both contributions have to be accounted for .",
    "obviously , the specular part tends to overestimate the roughness correction for such distances and only when also considering the diffuse contribution one will get the correct result .    to understand why the diffuse part becomes important for small distances",
    "we take a closer look at the purely evanescent components of the diffuse poynting vector in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : specsecondorder ] ) and ( [ eq : poyntingdiff ] ) . for the scattering of evanescent p - modes into evanescent p - modes",
    "this component can be written as @xmath116 where we have introduced the function @xmath117 comprising all the factors which are not essential for the discussion of the integral and @xmath118 the quantity @xmath119 is proportional to the transmission coefficient @xmath120 for evanescent p - modes coming from slab @xmath40 which are transmitted into slab @xmath41 and conversely .",
    "this means that the integrand is proportional to @xmath121 describing the transmission of a p - polarized evanescent wave with wave vector @xmath38 from slab @xmath40 to slab @xmath41 being scattered into a p - polarized evanescent wave with wave vector @xmath42 which is transmitted back into slab @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , this product is proportional to the transmission coefficient describing how much of the energy is scattered back into the first slab by diffuse scattering within the second slab ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diffusepart ] ) . in the non - retarded or quasi - static limit the weighting factor",
    "@xmath122 for @xmath119 becomes @xmath123 , i.e. , the transmission is the strongest if @xmath124 .",
    "hence , one can conclude that the integrand is large when @xmath125 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath126 the integrand is small .",
    "since the scattering within the rough surface is approximately limited to @xmath127 by the surface roughness power spectrum [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : roughnesspowerspec ] ) ] , we can conclude that for @xmath128 the diffuse component @xmath75 is comparatively small and can get large in the opposite limit , i.e. , for @xmath129 . in addition , due to the fabry - prot denominators in @xmath119 and",
    "@xmath130 the diffuse contribution is especially large if @xmath131 and @xmath132 corresponds to surface modes .",
    "such scattering processes with @xmath133 are reminiscent of directional scattering of surface modes  @xcite .",
    "to get some insight into the physical mechanism underlying the roughness correction , we will first discuss the transmission coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath134 which are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : defi0b]),([eq : poyntingdiff]),([eq : pertresspecprop ] ) and ( [ eq : pertresspec ] ) and then we will turn to the spectrum of the zeroth - order poynting vector @xmath135 and the second - order term @xmath136 .    first , for distances larger or comparable to the thermal wavelength @xmath137 at @xmath138 the propagating modes with",
    "@xmath139 dominate the contribution to the mean poynting vector .",
    "for the two slab configuration these modes are given by the gap modes for which @xmath83 equals 1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionstandingwaveprs ] ( a ) for p - polarized modes choosing @xmath140 .",
    "the correction to the transmission coefficient due to roughness scattering is in this case dominated by the specular part .",
    "nonetheless , this roughness correction is rather small for the chosen roughness parameters as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionstandingwaveprs ] ( b ) .    apart from this ,",
    "due to the roughness scattering the evanescent surface polariton contribution can couple to the propagating modes  @xcite so that even for distances @xmath141 one finds a relatively large correction to the transmission coefficient for frequencies close to the surface resonance frequency , which is for sic given by @xmath142 . for @xmath140",
    "this correction is in the order of some percent . since",
    ", the propagating modes dominate the heat transfer for @xmath140 the overall correction to the poynting vector is small .",
    "now , for distances much smaller than the thermal wavelength @xmath143 the near - field heat transfer is solely determined by the p - polarized surface mode contribution . for such distances",
    "the diffuse contribution can not be neglected .",
    "choosing a distance of @xmath144 we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionev ] ( a ) a plot of @xmath145 first . here",
    ", one can observe the splitting of the two surface phonon polariton branches  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can estimate from fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionev ] ( a ) that the relevant contributions stem from lateral wave vectors @xmath131 smaller than about @xmath146 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionev ] ( b ) we show the corresponding plot of the roughness correction @xmath147 .",
    "we find a qualitative similar correction as found for the roughness scattering considering only one rough surface  @xcite with the difference ( apart from the splitting of the surface mode branches ) that there is a positive correction for lateral wave vectors smaller than about @xmath148 for frequencies around @xmath149 and again a negative correction for lateral wave vectors larger than @xmath148 . as we will see below , when integrating @xmath150 over the lateral wave vector to get @xmath151 this positive correction will make the negative one weaker compared to the case of only one rough surface in ref .",
    "this results in a positive overall correction to the heat flux for all distances in contrast to the results found for only one rough surface  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionev ] ( c ) we plot the corresponding diffuse contribution @xmath152 in the same @xmath63-range . as expected the diffuse component gives a negative correction which is relatively large for frequencies near the surface mode resonance .",
    "this correction can be as large as @xmath153 percent for @xmath144 .",
    "hence , we can conclude that in the evanescent regime where the heat transfer is due to the coupling of surface phonon polaritons the roughness correction can be relatively large even for a shallow surface roughnesses .",
    "now , we turn to the effect of roughness scattering to the poynting vector in the spectral domain , i.e. , we concentrate on @xmath154 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral5000 nm ] we have plotted @xmath154 for the specular and diffuse contribution using @xmath140 in a frequency range between @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "we have also plotted @xmath157 using a scaling such that the curve fits into the plot .",
    "first of all one can see that , for such a large distance , the diffuse contribution is negative as implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : poyntingdiff ] ) and about three orders of magnitude smaller than the specular contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the specular contribution gives a relatively large correction of some percent near the surface resonance @xmath158 , only .",
    "this correction is the sum of the positive and negative corrections to the propagating gap mode and the evanescent and propagating polariton mode correction within the reststrahlen region .",
    "since the positive contribution to @xmath154 is larger than the negative one , one can expect to get a purely positive roughness correction to the poynting vector when carrying out the frequency integral .",
    "furthermore , since the heat flux is not solely determined by the surface mode , but rather dominated by the gap modes ( for frequencies greater than @xmath159 ) for which the roughness correction is very small , it follows that the roughness correction to the poynting vector is small for distances around or greater than the thermal wavelength .    in the evanescent regime ,",
    "i.e. , for a distance of @xmath144 we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral ] the correction due to the scattering of surface phonon polaritons . as in the case for one rough surface  @xcite",
    "we find for the specular part a positive correction for frequencies below and above the surface phonon polariton frequency ( @xmath160 ) and a negative one for frequencies very close to the @xmath149 .",
    "in contrast to the case of one rough surface , here the positive contributions are larger than the negative ones so that the overall poynting vector is positive at this distance .",
    "furthermore , the diffuse contribution to the heat flux starts to play an important role and gives contributions in the same order of magnitude as the specular one for frequencies near @xmath149 .",
    "this negative correction due to the diffuse component is still so small that the integral over all frequencies remains positive .",
    "therefore , for the configuration considered here , the scattering of surface phonon polaritons does not imply a negative correction to the heat flux as it was found for the heat transfer between a nanoparticle and a rough surface  @xcite .",
    "in addition , since the zeroth - order @xmath157 is dominated by the surface mode contribution for distances much smaller than @xmath143 , the roughness correction of several percent gives a change of the heat flux of several percent .",
    "hence , in the evanescent regime one can expect that the roughness correction will be relatively large compared to the propagating regime .",
    "now , we want to compare the numerical results for the heat flux with the so - called proximity approximation ( pa ) . this will be useful to understand why the coherent flux is increased by the roughness . within this approximation",
    "the rough surfaces are locally approximated by a flat surface ( see fig .  [ fig : sketchpa ] ) so that the mean flux can be computed from the flux between two flat surfaces @xmath106 by @xmath162 when considering dielectric materials , then @xmath163 in the quasi - static regime so that the pa can be further simplified to @xmath164 for the case of two rough surfaces the pa was first used to estimate the near - field radiative heat transfer between two rough surfaces in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , with the perturbation result we can discuss the range of validity of this very simple approximation .",
    "as for the case of one rough surface discussed in ref .  @xcite one can expect that the pa is valid as far as @xmath165 , since then the local approximation by flat surfaces with a lateral extension much smaller than @xmath17 can be assumed to be useful . in order to explore the range of validity of the pa we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : validitypa ] a plot of @xmath166 over the correlation length @xmath167 for different distances .",

    "hence , we can conclude that the pa can be used for @xmath169 .",
    "this conclusion is not trivial , since for sic the near - field heat transfer is due to the coupling of thermally excited surface modes .",
    "the thermal near fields associated with these surface modes can have a lateral coherence length @xmath170 larger than the vacuum wave length  @xcite and can therefore be larger than the correlation length @xmath171 considered here .",
    "however , in the quasi - static regime ( @xmath172 ) it is found  @xcite that @xmath173 .",
    "hence , for distances @xmath174 the thermally generated fields above different surface elements having an area smaller than @xmath175 and larger than @xmath176 are uncorrelated .",
    "hence , for @xmath174 the flat areas can indeed be regarded as independent so that the pa is valid .",
    "numerically , we find for sic that for distances @xmath174 the correction to the heat flux is given by the sum of the positive specular and the negative diffuse contribution .",
    "the specular correction tends to give results larger than the one predicted by the pa . only , when also considering the diffuse component of the heat flux , we retrieve the pa result",
    ". therefore , the interplay of the diffuse and the specular scattering of the surface polaritons guarantees the validity of the pa . on the other hand , for au which has no surface resonance around @xmath143 we find that the diffuse part is negligible small . in this case",
    "the pa is also valid and is due to the specular part only .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pa ] we plot the roughness correction for sic and au together with a numerical evaluation of the pa in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pages ] ) . in both cases",
    "the pa gives a good approximation for distances @xmath174 . as can be expected the curve for sic converges for very small distances to the quasi - static expression for the pa in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pa ] ) , since @xmath177 in the quasi - static regime . for au @xmath106 saturates for small distances",
    "so that the quasi - static expression in eq .",

    "to summarize , for distances @xmath161 the pa gives a good approximation of the impact of surface roughness for all the materials considered here .",
    "this allows for estimating the effect of surface roughness from the results obtained for a flat surface and is therefore an important result of this work .",
    "note , that the same range of validity for the pa has also been reported for the casimir force  @xcite . in this case",

    "we found that the heat flux becomes larger when surface roughness is taken into account . by giving a detailed discussion of the correction to the transmission coefficients and the spectral poynting vector for two sic slabs",
    ", we could show that the scattering of surface modes within the rough surfaces causes a larger heat flux which is in contrast to the case of only one rough surface as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown that the pa is valid for distances smaller than the correlation length of the surface roughness regardless of the materials ( sic , au ) considered in this work .",
    "in particular , for the case of two sic slabs the validity of the pa is due to an interplay of the specular and diffuse contribution to the mean poynting vector , whereas for au which do not have a surface polariton resonance in the infrared region the specular part already gives the pa result .",

    "<S> the surface roughness correction to the near - field heat transfer between two rough bulk materials is discussed by using second - order perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the results allow for estimating the impact of surface roughness to the heat transfer in recent experiments between two plates and between a micro - sphere and a plate ( using the derjaguin approximation ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the proximity approximation for describing rough surfaces is valid for distances much smaller than the correlation length of the surface roughness even if the heat transfer is dominated by the coupling of surface modes . </S>"
