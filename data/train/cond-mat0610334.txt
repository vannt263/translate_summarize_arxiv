    "although the @xmath4-axis boundary condition is not strictly imposed in these systems the transverse vortex motion is still restricted by the boundary conditions at the side edges .",
    "this is the main reason why , in the mesa or the s - shaped - stack structure , clear magnetoresistance oscillations are observed by the interplay between the near - static triangular josephson - vortex configuration@xcite and the boundary potential in the systems , while the transverse josephson - vortex multiple modes are not obtained .",
    "one should be noted that the multiple collective josephson vortex modes can be obtained only in a stack containing a finite number of ( intrinsic ) josephson junctions .",
    "the triumph of this study is that our samples truly satisfied this condition of a finite number of junctions in a stack and , as a result , both the near - static josephson vortex state highly coupled to the edge potential and the collective transverse josephson - vortex state were identified in each junction .",
    "this facilitated the detailed identification of the vortex configurations illustrated in fig . 1 .",

    "<S> we report the experimental confirmation of the collective transverse plasma modes excited by the josephson vortex lattice in stacks of intrinsic josephson junctions in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 single crystals . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation was confirmed by analyzing the temperature ( @xmath2 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) dependencies of the multiple sub - branches in the josephson - vortex - flow region of the current - voltage characteristics of the system . in the near - static josephson vortex state for a low tunneling bias current , </S>",
    "<S> pronounced magnetoresistance oscillations were observed , which represented a triangular - lattice vortex configuration along the @xmath4 axis . in the dynamic vortex state in a sufficiently high magnetic field and for a high bias current , </S>",
    "<S> splitting of a single josephson vortex - flow branch into multiple sub - branches was observed . </S>",
    "<S> detailed examination of the sub - branches for varying @xmath3 field reveals that sub - branches represent the different modes of the josephson - vortex lattice along the @xmath4 axis , with varied configuration from a triangular to a rectangular lattices . </S>",
    "<S> these multiple sub - branches merge to a single curve at a characteristic temperature , above which no dynamical structural transitions of the josephson vortex lattice is expected . </S>"
