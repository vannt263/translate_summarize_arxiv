    "the galaxy population today can very broadly be divided into a population of star - forming disk galaxies and a population of passive early - type galaxies . although this has been known for a long time , the physics behind the dichotomy in galaxy properties are still poorly understood .",
    "in particular , the model of the formation of massive , red elliptical galaxies has frequently been modified , driven by observations .",
    "the recent popular hierarchical galaxy formation models produce galaxies of the required mass , but can not match their quiescent stellar populations , unless a mechanism  such as feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns )  is invoked to stop star formation at early times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the role of agns and in particular their feedback processes in the star formation history ( sfh ) of a galaxy is one of today s major challenges .",
    "the tight relation between the black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion @xcite may imply that black hole accretion is directly related to the formation of its host galaxy .",
    "moreover , stellar populations of the host galaxies seem to relate to the strength of the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the effects of agn feedback processes are still poorly understood .",
    "the best example of agn feedback `` at work '' is the brightest cluster galaxy perseus a , which is injecting energy in the intracluster medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". there are several other recent attempts to constrain the truncation mechanism , which use the large statistical data - sets available at low redshift .",
    "for example , @xcite derive an empirical relation for a critical black - hole mass ( as a function of velocity dispersion ) above which the outflows from these black holes suppress star formation in their hosts .",
    "although the low redshift studies benefit from large , high - quality surveys and detailed information , they do not enable us to witness the star formation truncation in more massive galaxies , as stellar populations studies show that these objects formed most of their stars at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "recent attempts to directly witness the agn feedback process at @xmath7 have been limited to studies in which galaxies are selected for their strong nuclear activity .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that an agn driven wind is the only plausible mechanism to explain the outflow of the gas seen in a powerful radio galaxy at @xmath8 .",
    "a more statistical approach is studying the x - ray properties of agns with redshift .",
    "these studies found that agns show a top - down behavior , such that the space density of the more luminous ones peaks at higher redshift @xcite .",
    "@xcite claim that this behavior reflects the decline of the characteristic mass - scale of actively accreting black holes with redshift .",
    "the fact that this behavior is strikingly similar to what is found for the stellar populations of galaxies , such that the stars in more massive galaxies are formed at higher redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could be a clue that the two are strongly related . in order to relate these two behaviors , and understand the role of agns in the sfh of massive galaxies it is crucial to study massive galaxy samples at earlier epochs .    at a redshift of @xmath9 massive galaxies ( @xmath10 ) range from starbursting to evolved ) ] systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus a massive galaxy sample in this redshift range may be expected to contain all evolutionary stages of the process that transforms a massive star forming galaxy into a red , quiescent system .",
    "as massive galaxies are bright at rest - frame optical wavelengths , a representative massive galaxy sample can be obtained by selecting at near - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , for detailed information about the star formation and nuclear activity in the massive galaxies , spectroscopic information is required . as the average massive galaxy at @xmath11 is faint in the rest - frame uv ( @xmath12 , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , if we want to obtain spectroscopic data on a representative massive galaxy sample at @xmath9 , we need to observe at nir wavelengths .    in order to understand the formation of massive galaxies",
    ", we are undertaking a nir spectroscopic survey for massive galaxies at @xmath9 with gnirs on gemini - south .",
    "ideally we would study a mass - limited sample with no regard for luminosity or color . however , many massive galaxies are too faint for nir spectroscopy on today s largest telescopes . therefore , we study a @xmath0-selected sample , which is much closer to a mass - limited sample than an @xmath13-selected sample .",
    "we note , however , that we may miss massive galaxies with comparatively high m / l ratios .",

    "the near - infrared spectra are flux calibrated using @xmath24 photometry .",
    "the spectra and @xmath25 fluxes are fit by @xcite stellar population models with exponentially declining sfhs , following the technique described in @xcite .",
    "we assumed a @xcite imf and adopted the reddening law by @xcite .",
    "the redshift was set to the emission line redshift during fitting .",
    "we allowed a grid of 24 ages between 1 myr and 3 gyr , 40 values for @xmath26  between 0 and 4 mag , and 31 values for @xmath27 ( the sfr decaying time ) between 10 myr and 10 gyr .",
    "gnirs is uniquely capable of this technique as for @xmath9 galaxies the instrument covers the whole rest - frame optical wavelength regime in one shot , from bluewards of the balmer break up to 7000  .",
    "the stellar population modeling , driven by the optical continuum break , yields redshifts as well .",
    "this is in particular useful for galaxies without detected emission lines , such as passive systems .",
    "the stellar population properties of the emission line galaxies studied in this paper are listed in table  [ cont ] .",
    "we observed the ten emission line galaxies with near - infrared integral - field spectrograph sinfoni during two runs , on 2005 december 10 - 13 ( 076.a-0464 ) and 2006 march 3 - 4 ( 076.a-0718 ) .",
    "the weather conditions during both runs were fairly stable , with a median seeing of 04 in the nir .",
    "we use the h+k grating ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) over the 8@xmath30 8  field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the fov is sliced into 32 slitlets , and the spatial sampling corresponding to this configuration is 025 @xmath30 0125 .",
    "we observed the galaxies according to an abab on - source dither pattern .",
    "the offset between a and b is half the fov ( 4 ) in the directions perpendicular to the slitlets .",
    "the offset between a and a is only 1 .",
    "this dither pattern enables an accurate background subtraction , as we observe empty sky on both sides of the object in each slitlet .",
    "the raw sinfoni spectra were reduced using custom idl scripts that perform the following steps .",
    "we start by correcting for the detector response by dividing by the lamp flats .",
    "next , we determine the positions of the spectra on the detector for each slitlet from the `` distortion frames '' .",
    "these frames are constructed by moving an illuminated fiber in the direction perpendicular to the slitlet over the fov . for every slitlet spectrum",
    "we determine the position with respect to the other spectra at each wavelength by tracing the illuminated fibre .",
    "the slitlet lengths , which are different for each slitlet , are derived from the obtained fiber traces in combination with the sky emission from the raw object frames .",
    "next , we make a combined bad pixel map for each individual frame , that identifies cosmic rays , hot pixels and outliers . to identify cosmic rays , we first have to remove the sky emission .",
    "an initial sky removal is performed by subtracting the average of the previous and successive frame .",
    "the remaining sky residuals are removed by subtracting the median flux at each wavelength for each slitlet spectrum , using the derived locations of the spectra on the detector , and masking the object position .",
    "next , we identify cosmic rays on the obtained images using l.a.cosmic @xcite .",
    "we add any remaining 4@xmath31 outliers to the map as well .",
    "this map is combined with a common bad pixel map , constructed from flat and bias frames . in",
    "what follows the combined bad pixel map will be transformed in the same way as the science images .",
    "we return to the raw images and again we perform a simple sky - subtraction , now using the bad pixel map to reject cosmic - rays and other defects .",
    "next , we cut and straighten all spectra , using the derived positions .",
    "for each slitlet spectrum , we straighten the skylines and perform the wavelength calibration in one step , so that the data are resampled only once .",
    "now , we can accurately remove remaining sky at each wavelength for each slitlet spectrum , by masking the object spectrum .",
    "the previous steps yield a 3d datacube for each exposure . finally , we combine the data cubes of the individual exposures , using the bad pixel cubes and the offsets .",
    "the final cube is divided by a response spectrum , created from the spectra of av0 stars , matched in airmass , and reduced in a similar way as the science objects .",
    "we extract the 1d spectra in two different ways depending on whether the h@xmath2  and [ nii ]  emission lines are blended due to a strong velocity gradient . for these galaxies ( ecdfs-3694 and",
    "ecdfs-10525 ) we remove the relative velocity shifts along the spatial direction before constructing a 1d spectrum , in order to obtain more accurate line measurements and ratios .",
    "while information on the total velocity dispersion is thereby lost , this procedure is justified for the purpose of extracting the integrated line fluxes for the analysis presented in this paper .    for both methods",
    "we start by binning the final sinfoni cubes in the spatial direction , to combine the ` spaxels ' of 0125 by 025 to spatial elements of 025 by 025 . as we are mainly interested in studying the spectrum of the line - emitting gas rather than the continuum emission , we optimize the extraction of the 1d spectra in the wavelength range around h@xmath2  and [ nii ] .",
    "we make an average reconstructed image of the data cube in the wavelength region around these lines .",
    "the wavelength region within twice the velocity dispersion of the lines is included , avoiding wavelengths with strong oh lines or low atmospheric transmission .",
    "note that the velocity dispersion is still unknown at this stage , so we have to iterate a few times to obtain the correct extraction region and the velocity dispersion . for galaxies with a velocity gradient , we take into account the relative velocity shift as well to determine which wavelength region is included    next , we select all adjacent pixels in the reconstructed image with a flux exceeding 0.20 - 0.55 times the flux of the spatial element with the most signal . this threshold value is dependent on the s / n of the line emission in the reconstructed images . in case",
    "no velocity gradient is present , the 1d spectra of the selected spatial elements are combined to form the final 1d spectrum .",
    "a 1d noise spectrum is constructed from the spectra of all spatial elements that do not exceed this threshold .",
    "for the galaxies with a velocity gradient , we fit the spectra of all selected spatial elements following the fitting procedure described in   [ line_meas ] .",
    "to avoid the residuals of skylines as being interpreted as lines , and to reduce the number of degrees of freedom , we fix the width to the velocity dispersion of the final spectrum .",
    "the allowed redshift is also constrained to a certain range , depending on the maximum velocity shift of the galaxy .",
    "note that these latter two requirements need a few iterations .",
    "we measure h@xmath2  and the two [ nii]lines in the spectra of all selected spatial elements , and retain the elements for which h@xmath2  and [ nii ]  @xmath32 6583 have a total signal - to - noise ( s / n ) @xmath33 .",
    "we visually inspect the spectra of each element to check if the lines are correctly interpreted .",
    "the rest - frame 1d spectra of these selected spatial elements are averaged together to form the final 1d spectrum .",
    "we constructed a final noise spectrum by quadratically adding the rest - frame noise spectra .",
    "finally , we added the 1d spectra to the previously measured gnirs spectra in cases where the s / n is low and the sinfoni data show no evidence for strong velocity gradients .",
    "we obtain emission line ratios , velocity dispersions and equivalent widths of the emission lines by modelling the extracted 1d spectra .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath0 spectral bands were fit separately . the @xmath34 band contains the lines h@xmath35  and [ oiii ]  @xmath364959 , 5007 .",
    "the @xmath0 band covers h@xmath2  and [ nii ]  @xmath366548 , 6583 .",
    "we fit gaussian models to each set of lines simultaneously , assuming a similar width for all three lines and one redshift .",
    "we note that the different emission lines may not have similar line width as they can originate from different physical processes .",
    "however , as we will use the emission line measurements to identify the main contributor to the line emission , we assume that all lines originate from the same emission line region . furthermore , the [ nii ]  and h@xmath2  lines have similar widths for the galaxies for which we could measure the lines separately .",
    "we adopt the ratios of transition probablity between the two [ nii]lines and the two [ oiii ]  lines of 0.34 and 0.33 respectively .",
    "thus , for each fit there are four free parameters : redshift , line width , and the fluxes of the two emission lines .",
    "the line widths were fixed to the best - fit value obtained from the set of emission lines ( either h@xmath35and [ oiii ]  @xmath364959 , 500 or h@xmath2  and [ nii]@xmath366548 , 6583 ) with the highest s / n . for the continuum we use the best fit to the gnirs low - resolution continuum spectra , corrected for velocity broadening , assuming that the stellar dispersion is similar to the gas dispersion .",
    "thus the continuum directly includes the balmer absorption .",
    "the 1d spectra are fitted by minimizing the absolute residuals from the fit weighted by the noise spectrum .",
    "this fitting method is preferred over @xmath37 fitting , as it minimizes the influence of sky lines and strong noise peaks .",
    "errors on the flux measurements were determined by fitting 500 simulated spectra , that were constructed from the original spectrum and the photon noise . in these simulations",
    "we also varied the continuum according to the probability distribution that followed from modeling the gnirs spectra .",
    "in cases where we fix the width , as derived from a brighter emission line in the same spectrum , we also vary the assumed width in the simulations according to the corresponding probability distribution .    for all galaxies except 1030 - 2026 , we start by fitting h@xmath2  and the [ nii ]  lines .",
    "we use the obtained redshift , line width and its probability distribution to fit h@xmath35  and the [ oiii ]  lines . for 1030 - 2026",
    "h@xmath2  is strongly blended with the [ nii ]  lines , even in the higher resolution sinfoni spectra .",
    "as this galaxy has a clear [ oiii]@xmath325007 detection in both sinfoni and gnirs spectra , we swap the order . thus for this galaxy we first derive the redshift , the line width , and its probability distribution from modeling [ oiii ]  and h@xmath35 . using the derived redshift , line width and its probability distribution , we can now measure h@xmath2  and the [ nii ]  lines .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows the 1d spectra and best - fit model for all detected emission lines .",
    "the final 1d spectra include the sinfoni data , or a combination of both sinfoni and gnirs .",
    "as the sinfoni extraction method is optimized for the line emitting gas , and the gnirs for the continuum , the final 1d spectra may not be representative for the whole galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , a comparison between gnirs and sinfoni for the galaxies which could be measured separately , show that the @xmath38 s are in good agreement : ecdfs-10525 : @xmath39  and @xmath40 ; 1030 - 807 : @xmath41  and @xmath42 ; ecdfs-3694 : @xmath43  and @xmath44 .",
    "the best - fit equivalent widths , line widths and emission line ratios are listed in table  [ model ] .",
    "the values for the emission line ratios are given when both lines have a @xmath45 detection . in case",
    "only one of the two lines has a @xmath45 detection we give a @xmath46 upper or lower limit . as can be seen in figure  [ spectra ] h@xmath2",
    "is detected for all galaxies , and [ nii ]  @xmath326583 can be measured for nine of ten galaxies .",
    "thus , we can determine the value for [ nii]/h@xmath2  for these nine galaxies . for 1030 - 1531 , which has no [ nii]detection we give a 2@xmath31 upper limit .",
    "for only two galaxies both h@xmath35  and [ oiii ]  @xmath325007 are detected at @xmath45 .",
    "for these galaxies the ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath35  can be measured directly . for four objects we obtained lower or upper limits from the fitting procedure , as one of the two lines ( h@xmath35  or @xmath325007 ) had a 2@xmath31 detection .",
    "for example , for galaxy 1030 - 807 the h@xmath35  line is detected at 3 sigma and [ oiii ]  @xmath325007 has an upper limit .",
    "thus , we can derive a 2@xmath31 upper limit on [ oiii]/h@xmath35 , from the 97.5% cut of the best - fit [ oiii]/h@xmath35  values of the 500 simulations .",
    "for the remaining four galaxies the modeling results yielded no limit on [ oiii]/h@xmath35 , as neither of the two lines was detected .    for all galaxies we apply a second method to constrain [ oiii]@xmath325007/h@xmath35 , based on the intrinsic ratio of h@xmath2/h@xmath35(@xmath47 ) .",
    "we determine a 2@xmath31 lower limit on h@xmath35  from the 2@xmath31 lower limit on h@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we attenuate h@xmath35  using the 2@xmath31 upper limit on the best - fit modeled @xmath26 and assuming extra extinction towards hii regions ( factor of 0.44 in @xmath26 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we combine the attenuated 2@xmath31 lower limit on h@xmath35  with the modeled 2@xmath31 upper limit on [ oiii ]  @xmath325007 to derive the 2@xmath31 upper limit on [ oiii]/h@xmath35 .",
    "the limits are listed for each galaxy in the last column of table  [ model ] .",
    "the h@xmath2  line of 1030 - 2026 is not well fitted in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "this is not caused by a wrong redshift measurement , as we know the redshift of this galaxy very accurately from the [ oiii ]  @xmath325007 line .",
    "there seems to be a second peak at a rest - frame wavelength of 6600  .",
    "although this `` line '' falls on top of a strong oh line , the emission feature looks real in the 3d cube .",
    "it could well be h@xmath2  emission from a companion galaxy or a star forming region located in the outer parts of the galaxy .      for each galaxy",
    "we make reconstructed images of the continuum and line emission separately .",
    "the continuum images includes all observed h+k emission , excluding wavelengths with low atmospheric transmission or strong sky emission .",
    "the linemaps include both the h@xmath2  and the [ nii]@xmath326583 emission .",
    "the s / n is not high enough to make linemaps of these two components separately .",
    "we included the line emission within two times the velocity dispersion of the emission lines , accounting for a velocity gradient if present .",
    "the continuum emission is removed using the flux measurements in the wavelength range surrounding the lines . finally , we convolve the line map by a boxcar of 3 pixels ( 0375 ) , to smooth out the noise .",
    "maps of the continuum and line emission are presented in figure  [ linemap ] .",
    "the spatial sampling of the reconstructed images is 0125 by 025 , unlike the reconstructed images used to extract the spectra , which are binned to 025 by 025 .",
    "the area over which the 1d spectra are extracted is about similar to what is included by the outer contours .",
    "a key goal of this paper is to elucidate the origin of the h@xmath2emission detected in slightly over half of the massive galaxies in our sample . in the local universe ,",
    "h@xmath2  emission is usually an indicator of star formation , and the luminosity of h@xmath2  directly correlates with the instantaneous star formation rate @xcite .",
    "however , other processes can also ionize hydrogen , in particular hard radiation from a central active nucleus . in this section",
    "we use different indicators for star formation and agn activity to determine the nature of the population of emission - line galaxies .      local star - forming galaxies in the sdss",
    "follow well - defined tracks in diagnostic diagrams featuring various emission line ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the appropriate diagram is [ oiii ]  @xmath325007/h@xmath35  versus [ nii ]  @xmath326583/h@xmath2 as these lines are relatively strong and are covered in both our gnirs and our sinfoni spectra .",
    "this diagram is shown in figure 3 .",
    "galaxies for which lines originate from photo - ionization by young stars in hii regions fall on the well - defined sequence . local galaxies outside this metallicity driven sequence are dominated by other ionization sources , typically photo - ionization by a hard spectrum such as produced by an agn .",

    "is presented by the dashed line .",
    "the galaxies between these two dividing lines are classified as composite hii - agn galaxies by @xcite . however , both @xcite and @xcite suggest that the hii driven sequence is offset to the right at high redshift .",
    "thus , we have to be careful when applying the classification scheme as derived for local galaxies to our high - redshift sample , as the behavior of the ionization ratios at high redshift is not well understood .",
    "the galaxies outside the hii sequence are generally divided into liners and seyfert 2s .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ ratios ] is the dividing line by @xcite .",
    "our eleven emission line galaxies are indicated by the red filled squares ( specific sfr @xmath48 gyr@xmath18 ) and blue filled circles ( specific sfr @xmath49 gyr@xmath18 ) in figure  [ ratios ] .",
    "remarkably , only four objects fall in the region of galaxies with pure star formation as defined by @xcite , while the other seven galaxies are classified as agn or composite hii - agn .",
    "three of these galaxies fall in the seyfert 2 regime , three galaxies may be liners or seyfert 2s , and one is classified as a liner .    while seyfert 2s are generally accepted as agns , the power source of liners is still debated .",
    "although photo - ionization by an agn is often the most straightforward explanation , liner emission has also been observed in extra - nuclear regions associated with large - scale outflows and related shocks @xcite .",
    "shock - producing winds can be driven by agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also by strong starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the ambiguity in the interpretation of liner spectra it is necessary to examine other indicators of star formation and agn activity , to determine for which of the seven galaxies with non hii region - like ratios an agn is the most likely explanation ( either directly through photo - ionization or through shocks produced by an agn - driven outflow ) .",
    "we first consider which are the most important additional diagnostics at our disposal :    _ x - ray emission : _ as is well known agns can be efficiently identified by their x - ray emission , which is thought to be due to up - scattered uv photons from the accretion disk .",
    "agn - induced x - ray emission can be distinguished from that induced by star formation by the hardness ratio and ( particularly ) the luminosity .",
    "for the galaxies in sdss1030 we use xmm data with a depth of 100ks ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "three of the ecdfs galaxies ( ecdfs-3662 , ecdfs-3694 and cdfs-6036 ) are in the cdfs proper @xcite , for which very deep 1ms chandra data are available .",

    "interestingly , only one out of seven galaxies is detected .",
    "limits are given in table  1 .",
    "these limits indicate that the agns , if present , are either highly obscured or accrete at sub - eddington rates .    _",
    "compactness : _ the spatial distribution of the line emission can provide information on its origin , as narrow line regions of agns are generally compact . however , extended line emission does not rule out the presence of an agn for galaxies with active star formation , as star forming regions contribute to the line emission .",
    "furthermore , agns can produce outflows , which may result in extended line emission . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ linemap ] , in several galaxies the line emission is very compact whereas in others it is extended .    _",
    "equivalent width : _ as we have estimates for the sfr in these galaxies from the stellar continuum fitting , we can compare the observed strength of h@xmath2  to that predicted from the best - fit synthetic spectrum . an excess of h@xmath2  emission could indicate another ionization source than star formation , such as agn activity .",

    "this work has several direct implications for high redshift studies .",
    "first , as for a significant part of the massive galaxies at @xmath1 the line emission is not dominated by pure photoionization processes from hii regions , the h@xmath2  luminosity is not a good diagnostic for the current star formation rate .",

    "however , we do not have direct evidence that the suppression of the star formation is caused by the agns , as the co - evolution of star formation and agn activity can simply be explained by the fact that both the agn and star - formation are fueled by a large gas supply . in this picture",

    "<S> using the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) , we have assembled a complete sample of 20 @xmath0-selected galaxies at @xmath1 with high quality near - infrared spectra . </S>",
    "<S> as described in a previous paper , 9 of these 20 galaxies have strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected h@xmath2  emission , and studies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow - up observations with sinfoni on the vlt . based on their [ nii]/h@xmath2  ratios , the spatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics </S>",
    "<S> , we infer that four of the eleven emission - line galaxies host narrow line active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . </S>",
    "<S> the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging from evolved to star - forming . combining our sample with a uv - selected galaxy sample at the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass </S>",
    "<S> , we find that black - hole accretion is more effective at the high - mass end of the galaxy distribution ( @xmath3 ) at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by comparing our results with sdss data , we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreased significantly between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> agns with similar normalized accretion rates as those detected in our @xmath0-selected galaxies reside in less massive galaxies ( @xmath6 ) at low redshift . </S>",
    "<S> this is direct evidence for downsizing of agn host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we speculate that the typical stellar mass - scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies , both at low and at high redshift , might be similar to the mass - scale at which star - forming galaxies seem to transform into red , passive systems . </S>"
