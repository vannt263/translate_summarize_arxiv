    "@xcite data may point to a more distant source region for these high energy enas .",
    "if the ring of higher interstellar pressure associated with the ribbon is then felt inside of the heliopause , the large scale pressure driving the ribbon is an external effect , and so would be expected to result in a largely stable feature @xcite .",

    "( c ) the latitude of the ribbon arc , compared to the magnetic pole defined by the center of the arc , depends on the distance beyond the heliosphere of the ribbon formation , so that a more distant ena source location will slide the ribbon towards the equator of the ismf traced by the ribbon arc .",
    "\\(3 ) the third possible mechanism forms the ribbon beyond the heliopause from secondary enas .",
    "primary enas are produced from neutral charge - exchange with solar wind or inner heliosheath pickup ions , and propagate outwards past the heliopause where they convert back to energetic ions through charge exchange .",
    "these ions convert , via charge - exchange , to the secondary enas that propagate inwards to ibex @xcite .",
    "the mean free path of a 100 ( 400 )  ena in the outer heliosheath is @xmath64 au , suggesting that ribbon enas must form over lengths of @xmath65 au .",
    "the long times ( decade ) for parent ions to travel outwards and return as enas might be expected to smooth out solar cycle variations and small scale structures in the ena fluxes .",
    "\\(4 ) enas from magnetic reconnection at the heliopause : magnetic reconnection is a mechanism that directly mixes the interstellar and subsonic solar plasmas , and might form transient structures in the ribbon in the regions where the interstellar pressure is at a maximum .",
    "alternating solar polarities would disperse the reconnection across both hemispheres of the heliosphere , but a continuous ribbon structure would need explaining .",
    "\\(5 ) if the subsonic solar plasma disperses the increased interstellar pressure throughout the inner heliosheath , the termination shock location may also be affected , and therefore , the production or energization of pickup ions at the termination shock may increase .",
    "\\(6 ) the dense interstellar plasma and tenuous time - variable solar wind plasma are separated by the tangential discontinuity known as the heliopause .",
    "the heliopause is generally thought to be unstable , either from shear instabilities or the effective gravity of charge - exchange ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "rayleigh - taylor instabilities are expected to dominate near the heliosphere nose , and shear ( kelvin - helmholz ) instabilities near the heliosphere flanks .",
    "these instabilities directly mix the inner heliosheath solar wind and pickup ion plasmas with the interstellar neutrals and plasmas , and thereby could increase the ena production rate ( e.g. by reducing hydrogen filtration ) .",
    "there is also at least one entirely new origin suggested for the ribbon , whereby it is a viewpoint perspective of enas formed where isns in the interface on the circumheliospheric interstellar gas charge - exchange with the surrounding hot plasma , @xmath66 k @xcite .",
    "despite the strong agreement of the ribbon location with the mhd models that reproduce the draping of the ismf over the heliosphere , the same field will affect the cloud around the sun where it may create an analogous yet - unknown asymmetry .",
    "ibex continues to return new ena data that monitor the interaction between the solar wind and interstellar medium at the heliosphere boundaries .",
    "two full sky maps have been completed and initially analyzed , and they show firmly that the fluxes of enas formed at the heliosphere boundaries vary with the solar magnetic activity cycle @xcite .",
    "the potential for enas to trace the relation between stellar winds and interstellar gas is enormous , with implications for the structure of the heliosphere and astrospheres around exoplanetary systems .",
