    "in the solar system , the coplanarity of planetary orbits and their moons , and the preferentially prograde rotation direction led kant ( 1755 ) to the suggestion that the solar system evolved out of a flattened , disk like structure ( `` urnebel '' ) .",
    "kant also proposed that planetary systems similar to the solar system might be common around other stars .",
    "two of the major observational breakthroughs in astronomy in the 1990s were the direct imaging detection of circumstellar disks around young stars in nearby starforming regions with the hubble space telescope ( odell et al .",
    "1993 ; mccaughrean & odell 1996 ; burrows et al .  1996 ) , and the indirect detection of giant planets in close orbits around nearby stars ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy & butler 1996 ) .",
    "these important observational findings provide strong support for kant s hypotheses .",
    "still uncertain , however , are the timescales of disk evolution and the exact physical processes leading to the formation of giant and terrestrial planets .    giant planets in the solar system",
    "possess a core of higher density material surrounded by a shell of metallic hydrogen and an outer atmosphere . according to one model , a higher density ( rocky )",
    "core with a mass of @xmath210m@xmath3 has to form first , before noticeable amounts of nebular gas can be accreted by the proto - giant planet .",
    "simulations indicate that at least 10@xmath4 yr are necessary to form a 10 m@xmath3 rocky core ( lissauer 1987 ) , and that another 10@xmath5 yr are required for the 10 m@xmath3 core to accrete 300 m@xmath3 of nebular gas .",
    "it is still unknown if massive circumstellar disks can indeed survive for such an extended period .",
    "a second model , recently reinstated by boss ( 1998 ) , suggests that gravitational instability of a protoplanetary disk leads directly to the formation of a giant gaseous protoplanet on time scales as short as 10@xmath6 yr .",
    "the rocky core then forms due to the settling of dust grains initially acquired , and by further accretion of solid bodies in the course of the following 10@xmath7yr .",
    "the difference in timescales for the formation of giant planets in the two models provides observational means to decide for or against either model by studying the circumstellar environment of stars with ages @xmath8 15myr .",
    "weak - line ( wtts ) and the even more evolved post - t tauri stars ( ptts ) are prime targets since  contrary to the very young classical ttauri stars  they lack strong 1.3 mm dust continuum emission .",
    "this suggests that wtts ( and ptts ) no longer possess massive cold circumstellar dust disks ( beckwith et al .",
    "1990 , henning et al .",
    "1993 ) . in wtts and ptts ,",
    "the ( dusty ) circumstellar matter was either already partially accreted onto the central star or redistributed to form planetesimals or  via disk fragmentation  to form directly giant planets .",
    "we devised a twofold strategy in order to study disk evolution and the timescales of the formation of planetary systems .",
    "first , taking advantage of the high sensitivity of the infrared space observatory ( iso , kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) , we searched for evidence of circumstellar disks around the presumably diskless wtts and ptts . secondly , using high - spatial resolution imaging , we aimed at directly detecting faint substellar companions to the wtts and ptts .",
    "section 2 describes the sample selection . in section 3",
    "we explain the observing strategies and give an overview of the data reduction and analysis .",
    "section 4 describes the attempt to detect substellar companions using the nasa / esa hubble space telescope ( hst ) and ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) .",
    "the results of the iso observations and their implications are discussed in section 5 .",
    "an overall summary of the findings is presented in section 6 .",
    "we selected the nearby ( @xmath2150pc ) chamaeleon t association and the scorpius - centaurus ob association for our study .",
    "young low - mass stars in ob assocations are of particular interest , as most stars  including our sun ( see vanhalla 1998 , and references therein )  are believed to have originated in ob associations ( e.g. , miller & scalo 1978 ) .",
    "in the course of photometric and spectroscopic follow - up studies of rosat sources , an initial sample of about 150 young , x - ray active late - type stars was identified in the chamaeleon t association ( alcal et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; covino et al .",
    "1997 ) and the scorpius - centaurus ob association ( kunkel et al .",
    "2000 ) .      traditionally , ages for pre - main sequence stars are derived based on their location above the main - sequence and by comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks and isochrones in an hr - diagram .",
    "this approach relies on precise distance estimates in order to derive luminosities . in scocen and cha , however , parallax measurements are only available for a handful of the x - ray active low - mass stars ( see frink et al .  1998 ; neuhuser & brandner 1998 ; kunkel et al .",
    "furthermore , the individual parallax measurements indicate a relatively large spread in distance among various members of these associations",
    ". hence it would be advantageous to determine the evolutionary status of the x - ray active low - mass stars using properties which are independent of the distance , like , e.g. , spectral features .    in general , the x - ray active low - mass stars in chamaeleon exhibit higher lithium equivalent widths than their counterparts in scorpius - centaurus .",
    "as lithium is continuously destroyed near the bottom of the convections zone , the photosheric lithium abundance decreases with increasing stellar age ( herbig 1965 ; bodenheimer 1965 ) .",
    "therefore the lower lithium abundance indicates that the low - mass stellar population in scocen is older than in chamealeon .",
    "martn ( 1997 , 1998 ) suggested a refined classification , based on h@xmath9 and lithium equivalent widths as a function of spectral type to distinguish between ctts , wtts and ptts . in a diagnostic diagram ,",
    "late - type ptts occupy a region intermediate between wtts and stars in young open clusters like the pleiades or @xmath9 per with ages of 60 to 120 myr .",
    "unfortunately , the lithium criterion can only be applied to stars of spectral type k0 and later , and does not allow to discriminate pre - main - sequence from zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) stars of earlier spectral types .",
    "thus the number of stars located in the ptts region of the diagnostic diagram represents only a lower limit to the total number of ptts in a stellar population ( martn 1997 ) .",
    "therefore additional criteria like stellar kinematics ( e.g. , feigelson 1996 ; frink et al .  1997 , 1998 ) are needed in order to distinguish between pre - main - sequence and zams stars of spectral type k0 and earlier .    in order to avoid a contamination of our sample by zams field stars , unclassified stars according to the diagnostics by martn ( 1997 , 1998 )",
    "were largely rejected . in chamaeleon , the majority of the young late - type stars are ctts and wtts and have typical ages between 1myr and 5myr ( alcal et al .  1995 ) . in the scorpius - centaurus ob association , a total of 76 tts were detected .",
    "49 of them can be classified as ptts , 20 as wtts and 7 as ctts .",
    "42 x - ray active stars in scocen remain unclassified .",
    "typical ages for the wtts and ptts in scocen are of the order of 5myr to 15myr ( kunkel et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the sample was narrowed down to about 50 wtts and ptts by selecting preferentially late - type stars with lithium equivalent width @xmath10 0.1 to 0.6  .      as we aimed for the search for faint ( substellar ) companions and the study of disk evolution , it is important to consider the effect of binary stars . in binary systems , the complex dynamics and gravitational interactions between the individual components and their circumstellar and circumbinary disks might influence the evolution of circumstellar disks and aggravate or even completely inhibit the formation of substellar companions ( papaloizou & pringle 1977 ; artymowicz & lubow 1994 ) .",
    "recent observations of circumstellar disks in multiple systems support these theoretical predictions ( e.g.  hk tau , stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 , koresko 1998 ; hv tau , monin & bouvier 2000 ) .",
    "all stars in the sample were therefore surveyed for visual and spectroscopic binary companions ( brandner et al .",
    "1996 ; covino et al .  1997 ; khler et al .",
    "2000 ; kunkel et al .  2000 ) .",
    "none of the detected companions was faint enough to be classified as a substellar source .",
    "binary and multiple systems with separations less than 3@xmath11 ( 450 a.u .  at a distance of 150pc ) were excluded from the final target list .",
    "table [ tab3 ] gives an overview on the physical properties of the stars which were observed with hst and iso .",
    "young substellar companions are still relatively hot , and are thus considerably more luminous and much easier to spot than evolved ( older and cooler ) substellar companions ( brandner et al .  1997 ; malkov , piskunov , & zinnecker 1998 ) .",
    "maybe somewhat counterintuitive is the fact that the best wavelength region to search for substellar companions is the near - infrared between 1@xmath1 m and 2@xmath1 m .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of late - type dwarfs and thus of young brown dwarfs and giant planets is very peculiar ( allard & hauschildt 1995 ; burrows et al .",
    "the molecular opacities which globally define the continuum cause the spectral energy distribution to peak between 1@xmath1 m and 2@xmath1 m , almost independently of the effective temperature . using the hst / synphot simulator and `` intermediate model spectra '' for brown dwarfs and low - mass stars from allard et al.(1996 )",
    ", we simulated the expected brightness differences between a substellar companion with an effective temperature of 900k , and its primary star with an effective temperature of 3800k and 2800k , respectively , when observed through various nicmos filters ( table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the narrow - band f108n filter and the intermediate band f165 m filter provide the smallest brightness difference between the primary and a substellar companion . for the hst observations we selected f108n because of its shorter wavelength which yields a 35% better spatial resolution compared to f165 m .",
    "in addition , the narrowband f108n filter provides a monochromatic , very well defined diffraction pattern around the science target , which is rather independent of the color of the object . more recent evolutionary models for low - mass stars and `` nextgen model spectra '' ( allard et al .",
    "1997 , baraffe et al .",
    "1998 , hauschildt et al .",
    "1999 ) largely confirm our choice of filter selection for the hst / nicmos observations .    in order to minimize the brightness difference between the primary and any possible substellar companion even further , we selected m - type wtts and ptts because of their smaller intrinsic luminosity compared to earlier spectral type wtts and ptts .",
    "simulations with the tinytim psf simulator ( krist & hook 1997 ) indicated that it would be possible to detect an object 5@xmath12 fainter than the primary at a separation of 02 . at a distance of 150pc ,",
    "a separation of 02 corresponds to 30a.u .",
    ", i.e.  comparable to the semimajor axis of neptune s orbit .",
    "the nicmos camera aboard hst was installed in february 1997 ( thompson et al .",
    "hst / nicmos observations ( see table [ tab2 ] ) of 24 m - type wtts and ptts in chamaeleon and scorpius - centaurus were carried out between 1997 aug 14 and sep 22 using nicmos camera 1 ( nic1 , 0043/pixel ) .",
    "the observations were obtained in the f108n filter using multiaccum mode .",
    "18 of the targets were also observed in the f110 m filter in order to obtain additional color information .",
    "exposure times were between 2560s to 3072s in f108n , and between 64s to 192s in f110 m .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the iraf / stsdas package calnica v3.1 .",
    "for the data reduction , we replaced the model dark frames ( as provided by stsci ) with darks derived from archived on - orbit measurements .",
    "the photometric accuracy of the flux measurements for the faint sources is limited by the uncertainties in the dark / bias subtraction , flatfield errors , and the resulting uncertainties in the local background .",
    "the overall photometric uncertainties are of the order of 005 for the brighter objects , and 01 to 02 for the fainter sources .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show examples of the reduced frames .",
    "as the nicmos psf can vary significantly from one hst orbit to the next , the hst / nicmos observations of all target stars were used to build up a library of hst / nic1 psfs in the f108n and f110 m filters . for each set of observations",
    ", we then identified the best matching psf in the library .",
    "sub - pixel offsets between target and psf were computed by cross - correlating the individual frames .",
    "the psf was then fourier - shifted , scaled , and subtracted .",
    "the resulting difference frames were searched for faint , close companions .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the typical detection limit ( solid line ) in terms of brightness difference versus separation .",
    "it would have been possible to detect a 47 fainter companion at a separation of 02 , and a 8@xmath12 fainter companion at a separation of 1@xmath11 .",
    "this detection limit is in good agreement with the detection limit derived from the simulations based on tinytim psfs .",
    "three of the `` single '' stars turned out to be close binaries , and two of the three wide binaries turned out to be hierarchical triple systems ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a number of faint objects , which were found close to some of the target stars , are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the observing strategy for the adaptive optics observations with adonis / sharp at the eso 3.6 m telescope was similar to that of the hst / nicmos observations . because of the need for a star sufficiently bright for wavefront sensing , only bright g- and",
    "k - type stars could be observed .",
    "the observations were carried out in the broadband h and k filter , with the intent to gather additional data with the circular variable filter ( cvf ) for good candidates for substellar companions .    in two observing nights in march 1997 , a total of 17 wtts and ptts in chamaeleon and scorpius centaurus were observed , and two 4@xmath12 to 5@xmath12 fainter companions were identified ( rxj 12253 - 7857 and rxj 14150 - 7822 , see brandner et al .",
    "unfortunaly , unfavorable weather conditions during the second half of the second observing night prevented any immediate follow - up using the cvf .",
    "iso offered the unique opportunity to search for subtle infrared excesses from circumstellar disks and substellar companions with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "as the temperature of circumstellar disks changes with radial distance from the star , one can probe the radial surface density and temperature profile of circumstellar disks by observing them at a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "if for example in the course of disk evolution the inner disk is depleted first , it should still be possible to detect the cooler , outer parts of the disk at longer wavelengths .",
    "consequently , the observing strategy was to observe the sample stars both with isocam ( csarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) at 6.7@xmath1 m and 15@xmath1 m , and with isophot ( lemke et al .",
    "1996 ) at 60@xmath1 m and 90@xmath1 m .",
    "the iso observations with isocam and isophot were carried out between 1997 aug 04 and 24 . of the 30 wtts and ptts in the initial target list , only twelve were actually observed with isophot .",
    "the isophot observations of twelve stars were carried out as 3 @xmath13 3 maps using the pht c100 detector in mode pht22 and the c100_60_um and c100_90_um filters .",
    "ntts155436 - 2313 was only observed with isophot .",
    "the other eleven stars were also observed with isocam .",
    "the isocam observations were obtained with a scale of 3@xmath11/pixel as 2 @xmath13 2 rasters using the lw2 ( 6.75@xmath1 m ) and lw3 ( 15@xmath1 m ) filters .",
    "no color information could be obtained for rxj 15460 - 2920 , as it was observed in lw2 only .",
    "total exposure times were of the order of 200s to 240s per filter and object .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the software packages cam interactive analysis and phot interactive analysis .",
    "the standard processing includes dark subtraction , deglitching , transient correction , flatfielding and mosaicing .",
    "none of the sources was detected at 60@xmath1 m and 90@xmath1 m down to a limiting flux of @xmath2400mjy .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the pipeline reduced isocam data in the lw2 filter .",
    "all eleven target stars ( 8 ptts , 1 wtts , 2 unclassified stars ) are clearly detected ( moneti et al .",
    "1999 ) . on several occasions additional foreground ( field ) stars are also detected .",
    "foreground stars can easily be distinguished from the wtts and ptts based on their lw3-lw2 colors ( see below ) .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using iraf and 4.5 pixel and 5.5 pixel apertures for lw2 and lw3 , respectively .",
    "random uncertainties should be of the order of a few percent , but systematic errors might be as large as 20% due to uncertainties in the transient correction and the uncertain color terms .",
    "table [ tab5 ] summarizes the results of the isocam observations .",
    "ground - based near - infrared spectroscopy of the target stars and the faint sources detected with hst / nicmos and adaptive optics was attempted in the course of two nights in april 1998 using the ctio 4 m blanco telescope and the near infrared spectrograph . due to fog and clouds ,",
    "no useful data were obtained .",
    "the psf subtraction of the hst / nicmos data did not reveal any faint objects which would qualify as a candidate for a substellar companion within 2@xmath11 of the wtts and ptts .",
    "a total of five point sources at projected separations @xmath102@xmath11 and 6 to 8 mag fainter than their primary were detected in the 24 fields ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "photometric and astrometric measurements for the faint sources are summarized in table [ tab4 ] , and a plot of brightness difference between the primary and a possible companion vs.  separation is shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the probability @xmath14 for an unrelated source to be located within a certain angular distance @xmath15 from a particular target is given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the cumulative surface density of background sources down to a limiting magnitude m. the probability for chance alignments increases with increasing angular distance and decreasing brightness .",
    "therefore , in order to derive an estimate of @xmath14 , one has to determine the local density of background sources first .    for the sources in scorpius - centaurus , parallel nic2 observations of adjacent fields",
    "were obtained in the f110w filter .",
    "the eleven nic2 fields cover an area of about 4000 square arcsec .",
    "68 sources with brightness values between 164 and 232 were detected .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the cumulative brightness function @xmath18 scaled to an area of 1 square degree .",
    "the number counts in the observed cumulative brightness function are in good agreement with the number counts expected according to the galactic model by wainscoat et al .",
    "no nic2 parallel observations in f110w were obtained for the targets in chamaeleon , but a cumulative brightness function can again be derived from the model by wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "as the probability for physical association decreases with increasing angular separation , our best candidate for a true substellar companion is the faint source @xmath22@xmath11 north - west of rxj12319 - 7848 . according to equation ( [ eq : eps1 ] )",
    "the bare - bone probability for it being an unrelated background source is only @xmath25% . in other words ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : eps1 ] ) yields a 95% probability for a physical association between the rxj12319 - 7848/c and rxj12319 - 7848 .",
    "similar reasoning has in the past frequently been cited as supporting evidence for the substellar nature of faint objects near a brighter star ( e.g. , 0918 - 0023b , jones et al .",

    "2000 ; twa-7b , neuhuser et al .",
    "2000b ) or a distant galaxy ( 0918 - 0023b , becklin et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "it is therefore advisable to refrain from assigning probabilities to individual sources .",
    "instead one should compute the ensemble statistics . while the probability for finding a background object similar to rxj12319 - 7848/c within 2@xmath11 of rxj12319 - 7848 is only 5%",
    ", the probability for finding any such object within 2@xmath11 of one of the 24 hst / nicmos targets is @xmath270% .",
    "it is thus not unlikely that rxj12319 - 7848/c is an unrelated background source .",
    "based on the observed cumulative brightness function for scorpius - centaurus , one would expect to detect on average 4.0 sources with f110w magnitudes between 1675 and 1915 on the eleven nic1 frames in the direction of scorpius - centaurus .",
    "one faint source was actually detected , which is a 1.5 sigma deviation from the expected average . according to the model by wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) 3.2 sources with j magnitudes between 1675 and 1915 would be expected on average in a field equivalent in size to the area covered by the 13 nic1 frames .",
    "four faint sources were detected on the nic1 frames towards chamaeleon , which is in good agreement with the theoretical expectation .",
    "the agreement between the m@xmath19 - m@xmath20 colors of the faint objects and the m - type wtts and ptts ( figure [ fig6 ] ) provides additional evidence that the faint objects are unrelated background sources and not substellar companions .",
    "in addition to 21 stars which were assumed to be single stars , also three wide binaries with separations @xmath0 35 were included in the sample .",

    "figure 1 in their paper indicates that a change in the average dust grain size from 0.1@xmath1 m to 5@xmath1 m leads to an increase of the specific extinction coefficient @xmath34 at 6.5@xmath1 m by a factor of @xmath25 , whereas @xmath34 at 15@xmath1 m remains virtually unchanged .",
    "such an increase in @xmath34(6.5@xmath1 m ) is equivalent to an increase in the spectral index @xmath9 .",
    "a `` flat '' spectral index @xmath9 = 0 , e.g. , corresponds to r=@xmath290.35 .",
    "thus any mechanism which preferentially removes or destroys smaller grains can provide a viable explanation for the observed differences in the spectral index of ptts in scocen and wtts and ctts in low - mass starforming regions such as chamaeleon .",
    "the higher ratio of ptts to wtts in scorpius - centaurus compared to chamaeleon suggests that the x - ray active low - mass stars in scorpius - centaurus are on average older than their counterparts in chamaeleon .",
    "alcal et al .",
    "( 1997 ) assign ages less than 5 myr to the majority of the x - ray active stars in chamaeleon , whereas kunkel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find average ages in the range of 5 to 15 myr for the wtts and ptts in scorpius - centaurus .",
    "disk evolution and grain growths in circumstellar disks would lead to a deficiency in smaller grains .",
    "such a deficiency in smaller grains should only last until a critical number of massive particles like rocks and planetesimals has formed .",
    "collisions between individual planetesimals will then replenish the disk with smaller grains . during the initial build - up period , however",
    ", there should be a phase in which a disk is almost devoid of smaller grains .",
    "apart from the age difference , the ptts in scocen are located in an ob association , and thus  unlike the wtts and ctts in t - associations  subject to the effects of nearby o stars and supernova explosions . both impacting shock fronts ( dwek et al .",
    "1996 ) and high energy photons from nearby o stars and occasional supernova explosions ( voit 1991 ) could change the distribution of grain sizes .",
    "overall , however , the contribution of lyman continuum radiation to dust destruction should be negligible as only grains with sizes of @xmath350.001@xmath1 m are affected ( see discussion in richling & yorke 1997 ) .",
    "thus disk evolution appears to be the more likely explanation for the difference in spectral index between ctts and wtts in chamaelon and the ptts in scorpius - centaurus .",
    "high - spatial resolution hst and ground - based adaptive optics observations , and high - sensitivity iso ( isocam & isophot ) observations of a sample of x - ray selected weak - line ( wtts ) and post ( ptts ) ttauri stars located in the nearby chamaeleon t and scorpius - centaurus ob associations were obtained and analyzed .",
    "the hst / nicmos and adaptive optics observations aimed at identifying substellar companions ( young brown dwarfs ) at separations @xmath0 30 a.u .",
    "( 02 at 150pc ) from the primary stars .",
    "while the sample was preselected against binary stars with 02@xmath8sep.@xmath83@xmath11 , we detected 5 binary stars with separations @xmath3602 .",
    "the largest brightness difference between a primary and a secondary in these close binaries is 175 .",
    "the relatively small brightness difference indicates that all five secondaries at separations @xmath3602 are low - mass stars with masses clearly above the hydrogen burning limit . even though it would have been possible to detect a 47 fainter object at a sepearation of 02 from the primary star , or a 8@xmath12 fainter object at a separation @xmath01@xmath11 from the primary star , no such objects were found within 300 a.u .",
    "( 2@xmath11 ) of any of the target stars",
    ". 5 objects at separations larger than 2@xmath11 , and 6mag to 8mag fainter than the target stars can very likely be attributed to a population of field ( background ) stars .",
    "we conclude that the formation of massive substellar companions at separations larger than 30 a.u .  from the primary star",
    "is very unlikely .",
    "isocam observations of wtts and ptts in scocen reveal infrared excesses which are clearly above photospheric levels , and which have a spectral index intermediate between that of younger ( 1 to 5 myr ) t tauri stars in chamaeleon and that of pure stellar photospheres .",
    "the difference in the spectral index of the older wtts and ptts in scocen compared to the younger classical and weak - line tts in cha can be understood in terms of disk evolution , and could hint that circumstellar disks start to get dust depleted at an age of around 5 to 15 myr .",
    "dust depletion is very likely related to the build - up of larger particles ( ultimately rocks and planetesimals ) and thus an indicator for the onset of the period of planet formation .",
    "in evolved disks , the presence of larger grains resulting from dust coagulation and the gradual build - up of larger bodies should manifest itself both in the scattering properties at longer wavelengths and in spectral features . in the near future , using sirtf / irs and sofia , it will become possible to study the mid- and far - infrared properties of the circumstellar disks around the ptts in scocen and other nearby star forming regions . furthermore , high - sensitivity co surveys with the atacama large millimeter array will be able to detect also the gaseous component of the disks around the ptts and wtts in scocen and chamaeleon . these surveys will provide the final answer to the question whether massive gaseous disks can survive long enough to allow for slow accretion of gas onto proto - giant planets over timescales of 10@xmath5 yr , or if giant planets have to form on much shorter time scales by disk instabilities .",
