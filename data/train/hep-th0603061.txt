    "chern  simons theory has been the subject of much interest in past decades .",
    "its relevance for the formulation of higher - dimensional supergravity models has been highlighted in , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "it has even been suggested that they could provide with an action for m  theory in eleven dimensions  @xcite .",
    "since superalgebras come naturally split into distinct subspaces , it becomes essential , in order to get a taste of the theory s physical content , to be able to let this structure be felt on the lagrangian itself .",
    "in other words , one must have a way to separate the lagrangian into pieces that reflect the inner subspace structure of the gauge superalgebra .    in dimensions",
    "higher than three , the cs form becomes a nonlinear function of the gauge potential @xmath0 and its associated field strength @xmath1 .",
    "this nonlinearity and the complexities of the superalgebras themselves make for a huge difficulty when it comes to performing the above - mentioned subspace separation .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to present a method , based on the iterative use of the extended cartan homotopy formula ( echf )  @xcite , which greatly eases the accomplishment of two important tasks .",
    "first , it allows the separation of the cs action into bulk and boundary contributions .",
    "second , and perhaps most importantly , it permits the splitting of the bulk lagrangian into pieces that reflect the particular subspace structure of the gauge algebra .",
    "the formulation of the method requires regarding cs forms as particular cases of more general objects known as _",
    "transgression forms_. the transgression form is the matrix where cs forms stem from  @xcite .",
    "it depends on _ two _ one - form gauge connections @xmath0 and @xmath2 and features prominently on the chern ",
    "weil theorem  @xcite , which expresses its exterior derivative as the difference of the chern characters corresponding to both connections .",
    "a crucial feature of the transgression form is its full invariance under gauge transformations .",
    "the cs form corresponds to the case @xmath3 ; its well - known pseudo - gauge invariance can be traced back to the fact that this fixing is not a gauge - invariant one  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ tgft ]",
    "some general properties of transgression forms are reviewed .",
    "section  [ s : echf ] presents the echf and shows how a subspace separation method that allows for a deeper understanding of the cs lagrangian can be built upon it .",
    "five - dimensional cs supergravity ( sugra ) is recalled in section  [ su5 ] as an example of the use of the method within the transgression / cs framework .",
    "we close with conclusions and final remarks in section  [ last ] .",
    "let @xmath4 be a lie algebra  , but we shall restrict ourselves to bosonic lie algebras for the moment in order to focus attention on the essential features of the theory . ] and let us consider the theory defined on an orientable , @xmath5-dimensional space - time manifold @xmath6 by the action  @xcite @xmath7 = k \\int_{m } q_{\\bm{a } \\leftarrow \\bar{\\bm{a}}}^{\\left ( 2n+1 \\right ) } , \\label{st}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a constant and the @xmath5-form @xmath9 is the so - called _ transgression form _ , defined by @xmath10 here @xmath0 and @xmath2 are two @xmath4-valued , one - form gauge connections , and @xmath11 the brackets @xmath12 stand for a rank @xmath13 , symmetric @xmath4-invariant polynomial , @xmath14 the choice , and the very existence of this bracket are all too important features that shape the theory to a great extent . here",
    "it will suffice to remark that , given an explicit matrix representation for @xmath4 , it is always possible to find such a polynomial   ( see ref .",
    "clearly , the cs action can be regarded as the particular case @xmath3 .",
    "the action  ( [ st ] ) is invariant under two large sets of independent symmetries .",
    "first , it is trivially invariant under diffeomorphisms , since it is constructed out of differential forms .",
    "second , it is invariant under the ( in general ) non - abelian , local gauge transformations @xmath15 with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a basis for @xmath4 .",
    "the connections @xmath0 and @xmath2 are regarded here ( and throughout this work ) as local one - form on spacetime rather than as global objects on the corresponding fiber - bundle , thus accounting for the transformation laws  ( [ da1])([da2 ] ) . from these transformation laws",
    "one can readily check that @xmath18 , defined in equation  ( [ theta ] ) as the difference between both connections , transforms as a tensor , i.e. @xmath19 in terms of a fiber - bundle description , these different behaviors correspond to the fact that the global fiber - bundle connections are not projectable to the base manifold whereas their difference is ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the full invariance of the action  ( [ st ] ) under  ( [ da1])([da2 ] ) rests on the invariance property of the symmetric polynomial @xmath12 and on the tensor transformation laws for both @xmath18 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is also deeply related to the chern ",
    "weil theorem , see @xcite .    in the cs case , where @xmath3 from the outset , this full invariance is reduced to pseudo - invariance .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the fixing @xmath3 is not a gauge - invariant one ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however straightforward to establish , both the diffeomorphism and the gauge symmetries are far - reaching , as is proved by the fact that they lead to nontrivial conserved charges  @xcite .",
    "the field equations for the transgression action  ( [ st ] ) read @xmath21 and the boundary conditions are @xmath22 a deeper analysis of the physics produced by the transgression lagrangian can be found in  @xcite . for the cs case ,",
    "only equation  ( [ fn=0 ] ) is present .",
    "as made apparent in section  [ tgft ] , the cs and transgression lagrangians allow by themselves for a general understanding of the formal aspects of the theory .",
    "the detailed physical behavior , however , is highly dependent on the choice of gauge group and invariant polynomial . since gauge groups used in practice often have distinct physically meaningful subspaces , it is useful to write the lagrangian in such a way as to reflect this structure .",
    "the following sections outline a subspace separation method for cs and transgression lagrangians . the method is based on a particular case of the extended cartan homotopy formula , which is reviewed for completeness in section  [ sub : echf ] .",
    "let us consider a set @xmath23 of one - form gauge connections on a fiber - bundle over a @xmath24-dimensional manifold @xmath6 and a @xmath25-dimensional oriented simplex @xmath26 parametrized by the set @xmath27 .",
    "these parameters must satisfy the constraints @xmath28 equation  ( [ tt1 ] ) in particular implies that the linear combination @xmath29 transforms as a gauge connection in the same way as every individual @xmath30 does .",
    "we can picture each @xmath30 as associated to the @xmath31-th vertex of @xmath26 ( see figure  [ mono ] ) , which we accordingly denote as @xmath32     and its boundary , @xmath33 .",
    "the one - form gauge connections @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are pictured as associated to the simplex vertices . ]    with the preceding notation , the echf reads  @xcite @xmath37 here @xmath38 represents a polynomial in the forms @xmath39 which is also an @xmath40-form on @xmath6 and a @xmath41-form on @xmath26 , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the exterior derivatives on @xmath6 and @xmath26 are denoted respectively by @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    ". the operator @xmath46 , called _ homotopy derivation _ , maps differential forms on @xmath6 and @xmath26 according to @xmath47 and it satisfies leibniz s rule together with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "its action on @xmath48 and @xmath20 reads  @xcite @xmath49    the three operators @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 define a graded algebra given by @xmath50 & = & \\mathrm{d}_{t } , \\\\",
    "\\left [ l_{t } , \\mathrm{d}_{t } \\right ] & = & 0 , \\\\ \\left\\ { \\mathrm{d } , \\mathrm{d}_{t } \\right\\ } & = & 0 . \\label{ga5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "let us now pick the following polynomial : @xmath51 this choice has the three following properties : ( 1 ) @xmath38 is @xmath6-closed   and bianchi s identity d@xmath52 .",
    "] , i.e. , @xmath53 , ( 2 ) @xmath38 is a 0-form on @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath54 and ( 3 ) @xmath38 is a @xmath55-form on @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "the allowed values for @xmath57 are @xmath58 .",
    "the echf reduces in this case to @xmath59 we call equation  ( [ cehfc ] ) the ` restricted ' ( or ` closed ' ) version of the echf .",
    "a first well - known particular case of the echf is the chern  weil theorem .",
    "setting @xmath60 in equation  ( [ cehfc ] ) one readily finds @xmath61 where the _ transgression form _",
    "@xmath62 turns out to be defined by @xmath63    a second particular case which is directly relevant in the present context corresponds to setting @xmath64 in equation  ( [ cehfc ] ) , @xmath65 where @xmath20 is the curvature corresponding to the connection @xmath66 .",
    "the boundary of the simplex @xmath67 may be written as the sum ( see figure  [ mono ] ) @xmath68 so that the integral in the left - hand side of  ( [ p1 ] ) is decomposed as @xmath69 each of the terms in this equation corresponds to what was called before a transgression form : @xmath70    on the other hand , leibniz s rule for @xmath46 and equation  ( [ lfda ] ) together imply that @xmath71 integrating over the simplex one gets @xmath72 where @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 in  ( [ q300 ] ) we have introduced dummy parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 , in terms of which @xmath48 reads @xmath77    putting everything together , we find the triangle equation @xmath78 or alternatively @xmath79 we would like to stress here that use of the echf has allowed us to pinpoint the exact form of the boundary contribution @xmath73 , equation  ( [ q300 ] ) .      in section  [ sub : echf ] the echf was reviewed in detail and two particular cases were examined . in this section , a subspace separation method for cs lagrangians",
    "is built upon the second of them , namely , the triangle equation : @xmath80 the triangle equation  ( [ treq ] ) splits a transgression form @xmath81 into the sum of two transgression forms depending on an ` intermediate ' connection @xmath35 plus an exact form",
    ". the detailed form of @xmath73 reads  [ cf .  equation  ( [ q300 ] ) ] @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the curvature corresponding to the ` interpolating ' connection @xmath84    it is worth stressing that , while each term in the right - hand side of  ( [ treq ] ) depends on the intermediate connection @xmath35 , they do so in such a way that their sum depends solely on @xmath36 and @xmath34 , matching what is found in the left - hand side .",
    "the subspace separation method is based on the triangle equation  ( [ treq ] ) , and embodies the following steps :    1 .",
    "identify the relevant subspaces present in the gauge algebra , i.e. , write @xmath85 .",
    "2 .   write the connections in terms of pieces valued on every subspace , i.e. , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "3 .   use equation  ( [ treq ] ) with @xmath88 4 .",
    "repeat step 3 for the transgression @xmath89 , etc .    after performing these steps , one ends up with an equivalent expression for the transgression lagrangian which has been separated in two different ways .",
    "first , the lagrangian is split into bulk and boundary contributions .",
    "this is due to the fact that each use of equation  ( [ treq ] ) brings in a new boundary term .",
    "second , each term in the bulk lagrangian refers to a different subspace of the gauge algebra .",
    "this comes about because the difference @xmath90 is valued only on one particular subspace .",
    "this method will be demonstrated with an example in section  [ su5 ] .",
    "in order to highlight the way in which the subspace separation method sketched in section  [ s : echf ] is used in practice , in this section we apply it to a simple five - dimensional case .    the standard five - dimensional cs supergravity  @xcite uses the @xmath91-extended ads superalgebra @xmath92 .",
    "this algebra is generated by @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , where the following physically meaningful subspaces are present :    1 .",
    "a @xmath99 subalgebra , generated by @xmath93 and @xmath100 2 .",
    "an ads subalgebra , generated by @xmath95 and @xmath96 , 3 .   and a fermionic subspace , generated by the dirac spinors @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "one may also go one step further and separate the @xmath99 subalgebra in @xmath101 plus an abelian part and the ads subalgebra in the lorentz algebra plus ads boosts .",
    "an essential ingredient in this construction is the symmetric invariant polynomial @xmath12 . in the present case",
    "this will be simply given by the supersymmetrized supertrace of the product of three supermatrices representing as many generators in @xmath92 .",
    "we use dirac matrices in @xmath102 to represent the ads generators , while for the rest we choose the adjoint representation  @xcite .",
    "the cs lagrangian is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 with @xmath105    in order to apply the subspace separation method to the lagrangian  ( [ lsu ] ) we introduce the following set of intermediate connections : @xmath106 repeated use of the triangle equation  ( [ treq ] ) now allows us to split the lagrangian  ( [ lsu ] ) as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 a few comments are in order .",
    "ignoring for the moment the boundary contribution @xmath110 , we see that all dependence on the fermions has been packaged in @xmath111 , which we call ` fermionic lagrangian ' .",
    "similarly , @xmath112 and @xmath113 correspond to pieces that are highly dependent on @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively , although some dependence on @xmath114 and @xmath115 is also found on @xmath111 . in turn , @xmath113 carries no dependence on @xmath114 .",
    "the last piece , @xmath116 , corresponds to an lanczos  lovelock - type lagrangian for gravity  @xcite .",
    "explicit versions for every piece may be easily obtained by going back to the definition of a transgression form .",
    "this amounts to a huge difference with the case where there is no tool to perform the separation . using only the cs form as a starting point",
    ", calculations can quickly become intractable for dimensions higher than three . as a matter of fact",
    ", a straightforward computation gives @xmath117 , \\\\",

    "explicit expressions for the boundary terms can be also easily obtained replacing equation  ( [ q3 ] ) in  ( [ bsugra ] ) , in stark contrast with the standard usual case , where multiple , iterative integrations by parts must be performed .",
    "in this paper some general features of transgression forms used as lagrangians for gauge field theories were briefly reviewed .",
    "a concrete theory is obtained from the general framework by picking a ( super)algebra and a symmetric invariant tensor for it .",
    "it then becomes important to extract physical information from the lagrangian . a crucial step in this direction",
    "is the separation of the lagrangian in a way that reflects the inner subspace structure of the gauge algebra .",
    "this is especially true in the case of higher - dimensional supergravity , where superalgebras come naturally split into distinct subspaces .",
