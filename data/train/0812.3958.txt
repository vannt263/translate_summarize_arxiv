    "convective instability drives turbulence in the outer layers of late - type stars , such as the sun .",
    "the large - scale magnetic fields of these stars are thought to arise from the interaction of turbulent convection and the overall rotation of the object . in mean - field dynamo theory ( e.g.  moffatt 1978 ;",
    "parker 1979 ; krause & rdler 1980 ; rdiger & hollerbach 2004 ) , this process relies on large - scale differential rotation ( @xmath2-effect ) producing toroidal field by shearing and the @xmath0-effect which regenerates the poloidal field . in simple situations , the @xmath0-effect is related to the kinetic helicity of the flow ( e.g.  steenbeck & krause 1969 ) .",
    "dynamos where differential rotation is important , e.g.  the solar dynamo , are therefore often called @xmath3-dynamos .",
    "the @xmath3 dynamo process was first invoked by parker ( 1955 ) to explain solar magnetism .",
    "mean - field models have been used extensively ever since to study various aspects of dynamos .",
    "although very useful in their own right , these models often rely on ill - known parameterizations of turbulence , such as the @xmath0-effect and turbulent diffusivity . only during recent years numerical simulations",
    "have reached a level of sophistication where large - scale @xmath3-dynamos have been obtained self - consistently within the framework of local cartesian simulations .",
    "these simulations operate in highly simplified situations and the turbulence is driven by external forcing ( e.g.brandenburg et al .  2001 ; brandenburg & kpyl 2007 ; kpyl & brandenburg 2009 ) . in rapidly rotating",
    "stars differential rotation is likely to play only a minor role ( e.g.  hall 1991 ) and there the @xmath0-effect generates also the toroidal field .",
    "these systems are called @xmath1-dynamos .",
    "again , such solutions have been found from direct simulations of forced turbulence ( brandenburg 2001 ; mitra et al .  2009b , c ) .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations of magnetoconvection have been around for at least two decades , but somewhat surprisingly large - scale dynamos were not found until quite recently ( jones & roberts 2000 ; rotvig & jones 2002 ; browning et al .  2006 ; brown et al .  2007 ;",
    "kpyl et al .",
    "2008 , hereafter paper i ; hughes & proctor 2009 ) .",
    "the first two studies are related to the geodynamo and therefore convection is rotationally dominated .",
    "the next two use a global models with an imposed tachocline ( browning et al .",
    "2006 ) or rapid rotation ( brown et al .",
    "2007 ) , respectively .",
    "the last two are local models with imposed shear flows , reminiscent of the shear dynamos reported from non - helical turbulence ( yousef et al.2008a , b ; brandenburg et al .",
    "the origin of large - scale fields in the non - helically forced simulations can not be due to the mean - field @xmath0-effect .",
    "however , the incoherent @xmath0-shear dynamo ( e.g.  vishniac & brandenburg 1997 ; proctor 2007 ) or the mean - field shear - current effect ( rogachevskii & kleeorin 2003 , 2004 ; kleeorin & rogachevskii 2008 ) could drive these dynamos . in the shearing local convection simulations the same two effects have been suggested mainly due to the fact that rotating convection alone has so far been found unable to generate large - scale magnetic fields ( e.g.  nordlund et al .",
    "1992 ; brandenburg et al .  1996",
    "; cattaneo & hughes 2006 ; tobias et al .  2008 ) , although it should produce a mean @xmath0-effect according to theory . this drawback has prompted speculations that the @xmath0-effect in its mean - field incarnation simply does not work ( hughes & proctor 2009 )",
    ".    a conclusive proof of the existence of an @xmath1-dynamo should be the demonstration of large - scale dynamo action in a simulation without shear .",
    "an additional property of such a setup is that the vishniac & cho ( 2001 ) flux of magnetic helicity is absent .",
    "this might lead to slow saturation of the large - scale magnetic field , unless there are other ways of shedding small - scale magnetic helicity .",
    "the most natural way of explaining the large - scale magnetic fields seen in the rapidly rotating global convection simulations ( brown et al .",
    "2007 ) would be in terms of a mean - field @xmath1- or @xmath3-dynamo . in the global models",
    "large - scale shear flows can also be generated , so it is not straightforward to determine what type of dynamo is operating there . in the present study ,",
    "we use local simulations to demonstrate that large - scale dynamos can indeed be excited in rapidly rotating convection , i.e.  in the absence of shear , as long as rotation is rapid enough .",
    "we determine the turbulent transport coefficients from the simulations using the test field procedure ( schrinner et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ) and use them in a one - dimensional dynamo model to test their consistency with the direct simulations .",

    "however , in the absence of shear , large - scale dynamos due to helical turbulence have so far been obtained only in idealized systems where the helical flow is driven by external forcing ( brandenburg 2001 ; mitra et al .",

    ", the lack of large - scale dynamos in rotating convection has been puzzling ( e.g.  cattaneo & hughes 2006 ) , although an @xmath0-effect should be present according to theory .",

    "the behavior of the growth rate and saturation level of the field as functions of rotation could be understood as follows : the small - scale dynamo is enhanced for slow rotation but starts to be rotationally quenched for @xmath185 .",
    "this might be explicable by an associated decrease in the length scale of the turbulence .",
    "on the other hand , for rapid enough rotation , i.e.  @xmath186 , the large - scale dynamo becomes excited and increases the growth rate and saturation level .",
    "we stress that the proposed suppression of the small - scale dynamo action due to rotation is at this stage only a conjecture that is consistent with the numerical data .",

    "it should also be noted that we can not expect rotation to quench the small - scale dynamo in the astrophysically relevant regime where @xmath55 is much larger than in the present simulations .",
    "there are , however , no compelling reasons to expect that the large - scale dynamo is suppressed when a small - scale dynamo is also present as long as magnetic helicity fluxes are allowed to leave the domain . for the most rapidly rotating case , with @xmath173 in the kinematic regime ,",

    "2008 ) , we note that it is characteristic of these studies that when the rayleigh number is increased , the taylor number is kept constant .",
    "increasing @xmath205 in these models generates a larger @xmath206 and this inevitably means that the coriolis number decreases as the rayleigh number is increased , i.e.  for a fixed @xmath207 the rotational influence is large for a small rayleigh number and vice versa .",
    "for example , in the paper of cattaneo & hughes ( 2006 ) , the smallest rayleigh numbers in combination with @xmath208 gives a coriolis number comparable to our largest values .",
    "however , these simulations do not exhibit dynamo action due to a too low @xmath55 , whose value also depends on @xmath206 . for their highest rayleigh number case , however , @xmath55 is large enough for dynamo excitation but the coriolis number is smaller by approximately an order of magnitude and no large - scale fields are observed .",

    "( 2008 ) may be too slow for a successful large - scale dynamo .",
    "another issue might be the absence of shear - induced helicity fluxes ( vishniac & cho 2001 ) , as discussed in paper  i. in browning et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , on the other hand , the presence of shear in the overshoot layer plays an important role , as is demonstrated by the striking difference to earlier results of brun et al .",

    "another aspect of the problem is that in local convection simulations the amount of overshoot decreases as rotation increases ( ziegler & rdiger 2003 ; kpyl et al .",
    "2004 ) .      in order to check how",
    "well the turbulent transport coefficients presented in the previous section describe the excitation of large - scale dynamos in the direct simulations , we use a one - dimensional mean - field dynamo model in which the test - field results for @xmath253 and @xmath254 are used as input parameters .",
    "the model solves the equation @xmath255 where the dot refers to a time derivative .",
    "the mean magnetic field and current density are given by @xmath256 and @xmath257 , respectively . here",
    "primes denote @xmath156-derivatives .",
    "the test field results for @xmath253 and @xmath254 can now be directly used in the mean - field model , leaving little freedom .",
    "we must , however , bear in mind the limitations of this simple model .",
    "firstly , the transport coefficients were determined for a single value of @xmath170 , whereas in the direct simulations a larger set of wavenumbers are available . secondly",
    ", the model is restricted to fields that depend only on @xmath156 , whereas the direct simulations indicate that the large - scale field can also vary in the horizontal directions .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to study whether the transport coefficients derived using the test field procedure can excite a dynamo in the present case . the results for the growth rate @xmath258 of the magnetic field from the mean - field models , using the coefficients shown in fig .  [ fig : palpeta ] , are shown in fig .  [ fig : pgr ] .",
    "we find that the two most rapidly rotating runs show clear dynamo action which is consistent with the direct simulations .",
    "these results support the notion that the mechanism generating the large - scale magnetic fields in the direct simulations is the turbulent @xmath0-effect .     from the one - dimensional dynamo model . ]",
    "it should be noted that for values of @xmath258 different from zero the actual growth rate will not be exactly equal to @xmath258 , because in general the components of @xmath253 and @xmath254 depend on frequency ( and thereby on @xmath258 )  just as they also depend on the value of @xmath170 ; see hubbard & brandenburg ( 2009 ) for details .",
    "we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that rigidly rotating convection can generate a large - scale dynamo .",
    "the importance of this result lies in the fact that , according to mean - field theory , rotating turbulent convection leads to an @xmath0-effect , which should result in a large - scale dynamo .",
    "so far this has not been seen in simulations without shear , leading to doubts of the applicability of the mean - field approach .",
    "the present results show that the lack of large - scale dynamos in rotating convection previously reported is probably due to too slow rotation .",
    "we find that an appreciable large - scale field is generated in the direct simulations if @xmath259 .    with the smallest system size explored here ,",
    "the scale separation is small even in the most rapidly rotating case ( run  a6 ) , i.e.  @xmath260 . in this case",
    "the large - scale magnetic field is concentrated in the @xmath209 mode .",
    "doubling the domain size increases the scale separation to @xmath261 ( run  b6 ) . here",
    "the @xmath209 contribution is smaller and most of the magnetic energy is found for @xmath167 and 2 modes .",
    "doubling the size of the box once more , @xmath262 .",
    "the magnetic energy peaks at the largest scales , although the @xmath209 mode is significantly weaker than in the cases with smaller system sizes .",
    "this suggests that for the present parameters there is a maximum size for the large - scale magnetic field structures which is larger than @xmath34 and smaller than @xmath263 .",
    "we compute the turbulent transport coefficients using the test field method and find that the magnitude of the @xmath0-effect remains relatively unaffected when rotation increases .",
    "however , at the same time the turbulent diffusion is severely quenched by the rotation . when these coefficients are used in a one - dimensional mean - field dynamo model ,",
    "the two most rapidly rotating runs exhibit a growing dynamo in accordance with the direct simulations .",
    "although the mean - field model is too simple to fully describe the field in the direct simulations , our results seem to validate the test field method further and lend support to our interpretation that the large - scale magnetic fields observed in the simulations are due to a turbulent @xmath0-effect .    on a more general note",
    ", the present results also represent a nice demonstration of the usefulness of mean - field theory as a predictive tool .",
    "in fact , as explained in   [ sec : magnetic ] , our work was motivated by the earlier findings of paper  ii that the @xmath0-effect increases and the turbulent diffusivity decreases as the rotation rate is increased .",
    "this did already suggest the existence of an @xmath1-dynamo for sufficiently rapid rotation  a suggestion that we have now been able to confirm in this paper .",
    "it should be noted that the magnetic field structure of mean - field dynamos depends crucially on the geometry of the domain and the nature of the boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , our results are not directly relevant to astrophysical bodies , because their geometry is not cartesian nor the boundaries periodic .",
    "our models can also not be thought of as local representations of a star , although it is possible to get some idea about the dependence of the transport coefficients on latitude ( ossendrijver et al .",
    "2002 ; kpyl et al .",
    "2006 ; paper ii ) .",
    "furthermore , the values of the magnetic reynolds number are obviously not in the astrophysically relevant regime .",
    "nevertheless , our simulations provide the first concrete evidence of dynamo action from rotating convection without the additional help of shear .",
    "this is an important point , because it proves for the first time that an @xmath1 dynamo from rotating convection exists and that it is strong enough to produce large - scale fields .",
