    "percolation is a useful model to study a variety of systems in many fields of science displaying structural disorder and statistical self - similarity . in particular ,",
    "the percolation geometry has been frequently used as a simple paradigm to investigate fluid flow in porous media @xcite . in this type of problem , the geometry underlying the system can be very complex and display heterogeneous features over a very wide range of length scales , going from centimeters to kilometers @xcite .",
    "for example , an open question in the modeling process of oil recovery is the effect of the connectedness of the porous medium on the dynamical process of fluid displacement .",
    "if the pore space is so poorly connected as to be considered macroscopically heterogeneous , one expects the overall behavior of the flowing system to display significant anomalies . in this way , it is important to investigate the physics of disordered media at a marginal state of connectivity , for example , in terms of the geometry of the spanning cluster at the percolation threshold @xcite .    the most relevant subset of the percolation cluster for transport is the conducting backbone . it can be defined as the cluster that carries the current when a voltage difference is applied between two sites .",
    "thus the backbone structure alone determines the conductivity of the whole percolation network .",
    "recently , barthlmy _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that the average mass of the backbone @xmath7 connecting two sites in a two - dimensional system of size @xmath8 obeys the scaling form @xmath9 , where the function @xmath10 can be approximated by a power - law for any value of @xmath11 .",
    "their results from numerical simulations with _",
    "uncorrelated structures _ indicate that , for the case where @xmath12 , the distribution of backbone mass is peaked around @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath14 , the distribution follows a power - law behavior .",
    "the fact that the geometry of real rocks is generally random does not necessarily imply that their disordered morphology is spatially uncorrelated .",
    "in other words , the probability for a small region in the system to have a given porosity ( or permeability ) may not be independent of the probability associated with other locations .",
    "this is certainly true for some types of rocks and geological fields where geometrical and/or transport properties can be adequately characterized in terms of their spatial correlations @xcite .",
    "it is under this framework that the correlated percolation model @xcite represents a more realistic description for the pore space in terms of structure and transport . in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "the hydrodynamic dispersion behavior of percolation porous media with spatial correlations has been investigated .",
    "more recently , we studied the displacement dynamics between two fluids flowing through correlated percolation clusters @xcite .",
    "it was found that the presence of correlations can substantially modify the scaling behavior of the distributions of relevant transport properties and , therefore , their universality class . in the present paper",

    "our model for the porous medium is based on a two - dimensional site percolation cluster of size @xmath8 at criticality @xcite where correlations among the elementary units of the lattice are systematically introduced @xcite . for a given realization of the correlated network ,",
    "we extract the percolation backbone between two sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 separated by an euclidian distance @xmath14 that belong to the infinite cluster and are sufficiently far from the edges of the system to prevent boundary effects .",
    "the correlations are induced by means of the fourier filtering method , where a set of random variables @xmath17 is introduced following a power - law correlation function of the form @xmath18~. \\label{correl}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is the uncorrelated case and @xmath20 corresponds to the maximum correlation .",

    "for each value of @xmath26 , we performed simulations for @xmath27 network realizations of size @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , and different values of the `` well '' distance @xmath0 to compute the distribution @xmath30 and the cumulative distribution @xmath31 of backbone mass @xmath32",
    "in fig .  1 we show the log - log plot of typical cumulative distributions of backbone mass @xmath31 for uncorrelated as well as correlated morphologies .",
    "it is clear from this figure that @xmath31 displays power - law behavior for intermediate mass values in both cases . in addition , the scaling region is followed by a sudden cutoff that decays faster than exponential .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed experimentally @xcite and through numerical simulations @xcite for the phenomenon of _ impact fragmentation_. based on these features , we argue that @xmath31 should obey the following scaling ansatz : @xmath33 } ~ , \\label{cumul}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a scaling exponent and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are cutoff parameters . for comparison with the approach presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we determine these parameters from the simulation results in terms of their corresponding distributions of backbone mass @xmath30 . from eq .",
    "( [ cumul ] ) , it follows that @xmath34 where the function @xmath35 has the form @xmath36 \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{m_b}{m_0}\\right)^{\\eta}\\right]~. \\label{func}\\ ] ] figure  2 shows the distributions @xmath30 generated for the uncorrelated case ( @xmath19 ) and different values of @xmath0 .",
    "they all display a lower cutoff of order @xmath0 ( the smallest backbone possible is a straight line connecting points @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) and an upper cutoff of order @xmath37 , where a `` bump '' can also be observed @xcite . for comparison",
    ", each of these distributions has been rescaled by its corresponding value at the position of this bump .",
    "the smaller the distance @xmath0 is between the wells , larger is the range over which the scaling term of eq .",
    "( [ distr ] ) holds , @xmath38 . the solid line in fig .",
    "2 corresponds to the best nonlinear fit we found for the @xmath39 data in both the scaling and cutoff zones with @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . because the sampling of the backbone mass should be equivalent to the sampling of blobs in the percolation cluster @xcite , it is possible to draw a direct relation between the scaling exponent @xmath5 and the fractal dimension of the backbone @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the exponent @xmath43 governing the blob size distribution can be calculated as @xmath44 . since the exponent @xmath45 governs the statistics of the entire backbone , we obtain by integration that @xmath46 , which gives a fractal dimension of @xmath47 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the current numerical estimate of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the case with spatial long - range correlations . as shown in fig .  3 , eq .",
    "( [ distr ] ) ( solid line ) also fits very well the simulation data for @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , both in the scaling region and in the cutoff zone .",
    "the parameter set obtained with a nonlinear estimation algorithm includes @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "compared to the uncorrelated geometry , the results shown in fig .",
    "3 for large masses clearly indicate the presence of a narrow plateau followed by a much more pronounced bump and a sharper cutoff profile .",
    "these features are consistent with the exponent @xmath55 and also reflect the fact that @xmath4 is significantly larger for the correlated case .",
    "the resulting fractal dimension of the backbone @xmath56 is in good agreement with previous estimates for correlated structures generated with @xmath50 @xcite .    for completeness",
    ", we show that the scaling ansatz used to fit the simulation results for @xmath30 is consistent with the observed behavior for @xmath31 over the whole range of relevant backbone masses . precisely , the solid lines in fig .",

    "( [ distr ] ) . although close to zero , the value of @xmath52 for the correlated geometry is sufficiently large to characterize the power - law signature of the cumulative mass distribution @xmath31 .",
    "the differences in the exponent @xmath5 obtained for correlated and uncorrelated cases can be explained in terms of the morphology of the conducting backbone .",
    "as @xmath26 decreases , the backbone becomes gradually more compact @xcite .",
    "this distinctive aspect of the correlated geometry tends to increase the value of @xmath6 and therefore reduce the value of @xmath5 as the strength of the long - range correlations increases ( i.e. , @xmath26 decreases ) . as in ref .",

    "5 we show results from simulations with correlated networks generated with @xmath50 for @xmath12 and three different values of @xmath8 .",
