    "the kuramoto model @xcite was originally motivated by the phenomenon of collective synchronisation whereby a system of coupled oscillating nodes will sometimes lock on to a common frequency despite differences in the natural frequencies of the individual vertices .",
    "this model has since been applied to a wide variety of application fields including , biological , chemical , engineering , and social systems ( see the survey articles including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and recently @xcite ) . while kuramoto studied the infinite complete network it is natural to consider finite networks of any given topology .",
    "this would correspond to a notion of coupling that is not universal across all node pairs , but rather applies to a subset of all possible links .",
    "for example the work patterns of human individuals in an organisation might enjoy a coupling effect in relation to pairs of individuals that have a working relationship . in this article",
    "we explain the significance of stable fixed point solutions to the model , and explore the algorithmic complexity of finding such solutions .",
    "each node has an associated phase angle @xmath1 , as well as its own natural frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the basic governing equation is the differential equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the adjacency matrix of the network and @xmath5 is a coupling constant which determines the strength of the coupling .",
    "note that each @xmath1 is understood to denote a function of time @xmath6 .",
    "an important special case is where all the natural frequencies @xmath2 are equal .",
    "we shall call this case _ homogeneous _ and the general case as _",
    "inhomogeneous_. typically @xmath4 is a ( 0,1)-matrix , however it may also be any real positive symmetric matrix reflecting coupling constants that vary for each edge .",
    "this case is of particular interest to us and we specify this by referring to it as the _ weighted _ kuramoto model . it is well known that results for unique stable fixed points can be obtained for restricted phase angles @xmath1 , say in the range @xmath7 $ ] . in this article",
    "we are concerned with results about stable fixed points over the full range @xmath8 .",
    "it has been observed that for arbitrary initial phases , networks _",
    "synchronize _ in that some of the node phases converge to the same , or nearly the same phase angle , while the phase frequencies @xmath9 converge to a common value .",
    "meanwhile , the remaining nodes behave non - uniformly or drift. moreover , at a sufficiently large _ critical _ coupling constant @xmath5 , it becomes possible for all nodes to participate in synchronized behaviour . by summing over equation ( 1 ) , the sine terms cancel and the average frequency of the nodes is a constant @xmath10 so that @xmath11 define a _ frequency fixed point _ as a situation in which all the node frequencies are equal and are fixed over time . by equation",
    "( 2 ) , this is characterized by @xmath12 it follows that for a frequency fixed point all phase angles remain constant .",
    "we note that a frequency fixed point may also be accompanied by _",
    "phase synchrony _ whereby the nodes have the same , or nearly the same , phase angles .",
    "this is however not necessarily the case , and the phase angles of a frequency fixed point may be significantly different .",
    "examples of this kind are the ring networks @xcite . combining equations ( 1 ) and",
    "( 3 ) , the phase differences at a frequency fixed point satisfy @xmath13 henceforth , we shall use the term fixed point to refer to a frequency fixed point satisfying equation ( 4 ) .",
    "the character , number and location of the fixed points of a network are clearly important in understanding the types of dynamics that are possible from all possible initial phases of the system .",
    "in particular , understanding the nature of all stable fixed points is particularly important , since each represent an attractor set of positive @xmath14-dimensional volume within the set of all states .",
    "fixed points can have a range of attractor types ranging from unstable single points , @xmath15-dimensional ( @xmath16 ) saddle point structures that are partially stable , to @xmath14-dimensional volumes for stable fixed points .",
    "let @xmath17 be a fixed point so that by equation ( 3 ) @xmath18 since @xmath19 is a constant for all @xmath20 we use the compact notation @xmath21 .",
    "a linear stability analysis shows the fixed point to be stable ( see for eg .",
    "@xcite ) if and only if the matrix @xmath22 is negative definite where @xmath23 and where the kronecker delta function is defined as @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . for a fixed point @xmath27",
    ", we can rearrange equation ( 4 ) as @xmath28 it follows that as the coupling constant increases in relation to the natural frequencies the left hand side of equation ( 7 ) tends to @xmath29 , in the limit giving : @xmath30 note that this limiting equation is the same as that obtained in the homogeneous case , and also that this equation is independent of the value of the equal natural frequency .",
    "thus as the coupling constant increases the fixed point for unequal natural frequencies converge to the solutions for the homogeneous system of equations ( 8) .",
    "furthermore , in the homogeneous case it is sufficient to consider the case where the natural frequencies are all zero .",
    "for this reason the fixed point character for the case where all natural frequencies are zero is fundamental to understanding the limiting behaviour of the general inhomogeneous case .",
    "similarly the stability condition does not depend on the natural frequencies ( see equation ( 6 ) ) .",
    "thus the homogeneous case can in some sense be considered as a guage of the contribution of the purely topological effects ( from @xmath31 ) on fixed points and stability .",
    "though the relationship between the network topology @xmath31 and the stable fixed points is a complex one , we have the following useful necessary condition @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 be any stable fixed point solution to the homogeneous kuramoto model .",
    "then for any proper node subset @xmath33 we have the equality @xmath34 and inequality @xmath35 it follows that if for every edge @xmath36 if @xmath37 , then the fixed point @xmath27 is unstable .",
    "it is also well known @xcite that if for each link @xmath36 @xmath38 then the fixed point is stable .",
    "these equations are useful in resolving the mixed case where some @xmath39 are less than @xmath40 and some are greater than @xmath40 .",
    "we shall often find the case where the sets @xmath33 in ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) are single nodes particularly useful , where ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) take the form @xmath41 it is useful to visualize the phase angles as points on the unit circle within the complex plane where the nodes are positioned around a circle , which we shall refer to as a _ phase angle diagram_. thus we let @xmath42 be given by @xmath43 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 1 with the representation of the hexagonal ring graph which forms a non - zero stable fixed point .",
    "there is also a simple physical intuitive way of understanding the phase angle diagram by interpreting each edge as an elastic link between beads on a frictionless ring .",
    "a fixed point corresponds to the elastic forces at each bead balancing out , and stability is manifested by any small perturbations of the beads returning to the fixed point ( see @xcite ) .",
    "representation of nodes on the complex plane , width=226 ]",
    "though the nature and presence of stable fixed points is well understood for certain classes of graphs , general results for arbitrary graph topologies seem difficult to obtain .",
    "thus complete graphs can have only one single stable fixed point @xcite as can all dense graphs with degree at least @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "also trees can have only one stable fixed point @xcite though the nature of all fixed points and the relationship to the coupling constant is well understood @xcite . on the other hand ring graphs do have multiple stable fixed points the nature of which is also well understood @xcite .",
    "in contrast we show that the most basic of questions about the stable fixed points of the weighted kuramoto model is unlikely to be computable efficiently . specifically , determining the presence of any non - zero stable fixed points from the network topology @xmath31 even for the homogeneous system is np - hard .",
    "this means that an efficient ( polynomial time ) algorithm to solve this problem is either very difficult to find or does not exist ( see the standard guide to algorithmic complexity @xcite ) .",
    "this remains true even if the phase angle differences across edges ( @xmath45 ) are restricted to @xmath38 .",
    "for the unweighted case we show that determining the presence of any non - zero stable fixed points from the network topology @xmath31 is at least as difficult ( up to polynomial complexity ) as solving a particular number problem . to establish the former we shall refer to the partition problem @xcite . in terms of related algorithmic complexity results we are aware only of the result of @xcite which shows that checking positive definiteness of symmetric interval matrices is np - hard .",
    "this problem is significantly different to the problem presented here in a number of ways however .",
    "for example general symmetric matrices have @xmath46 degrees of freedom wheras the kuramoto graphs have @xmath47 degrees of freedom ( without loss of generality any one node can be fixed at phase angle @xmath29 ) .",
    "also we seek negative definiteness in conjunction with @xmath14 equality conditions in the form of the frequency fixed point equations ( 8) .      using the standard formalism of @xcite + * partition * +",

    "<S> the kuramoto model when considered over the full space of phase angles [ @xmath0 ) can have multiple stable fixed points which form basins of attraction in the solution space . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the fundamentally complex relationship between the network topology and the solution space by showing that determining the possibility of multiple stable fixed points from the network topology is np - hard for the weighted kuramoto model . in the case of the unweighted model </S>",
    "<S> this problem is shown to be at least as difficult as a number partition problem , which we conjecture to be np - hard . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that it is unlikely that stable fixed points of the kuramoto model can be characterized in terms of easily computable network invariants . </S>"
