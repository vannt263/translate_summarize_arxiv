    "namely , we will discuss the role of the _ support _ of the discrete equations , that is , roughly speaking , the set where the independent variables live .",
    "of course , the most natural way to discretize 2-dimensional pde is to consider equations on the regular square grid @xmath1 as above , but recent results [ 8  15 ] demonstrate that possibly more general synonym of ` 2d ' in the discrete case is ` planar graphs ' .",
    "it should be noted that non - standard planar graphs were considered in mathematical physics already quite a while ago ( see e.g. korepin s works  @xcite where the solvable spin models on the quasi - crystallic tilings were investigated ) .",

    "the integrability can be understood as the so called 3d consistency property , introduced and studied in [ 9  12 ] .",
    "the discrete potential kdv equation on quad - graph reads locally exactly as on the square lattice : @xmath2 but now it is assumed that the fields @xmath3 are assigned to the vertices of the quad - graph and the parameters @xmath4 are assigned to the edges , as shown on the fig.[fig : quad ] below , and the relation ( [ dkdv ] ) must be fulfilled for each face of the graph .",
    "section [ s : ivp ] is devoted to the general discussion of the possible settings of cauchy , or initial value problem ( ivp ) on quad - graphs . at the first sight",
    "the question about the correctness of ivp is not related to integrability but in fact it does very much ( see e.g. fig . [",
    "fig : defect10 ] , [ fig : aa ] below ) .",
    "the 3d consistency property plays an essential role here .",
    "section [ s : corr ] contains the main result of the paper : a criterion for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of cauchy problem for an integrable equation on a quad - graph ( theorem  [ th : corr ] ) .    in section 5",

    "we discuss the solutions of the linear discrete wave equation @xmath5 on quad - graphs .",
    "surprisingly enough , in contrast to the non - linear case these solutions have a non - trivial interaction with weak defects , although the effect is limited ( see theorem  [ th : wave ] ) .",

    "we will see in the next sections that this notion is very important in the theory of quad - graph equations and plays the role similar to the characteristics for the second - order hyperbolic eqautions . in the particular case of dkdv equation on the square lattice ( [ dkdvmn ] )",
    "we have two families of the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 assigned to the vertical and horizontal straight strips , but in the general case the strips may bend and intersect in a very complicated way ( for instance , self - crossing , self - tangent and closed strips are possible ) .",
    "some characteristics are shown at the pictures below by dashed lines crossing the adjacent edges of the faces in the strip .",
    "the second property allows us to define equation on each face independently on its position in the quad - graph .",
    "the third property means that the equation ( [ qeq ] ) can be solved with respect to a field at any vertex as linear fractional expression of other three fields .",
    "this expression could be singular for some special values of the fields , which is not essential for many types of quad - graphs , since we are interested only in the generic initial data .",
