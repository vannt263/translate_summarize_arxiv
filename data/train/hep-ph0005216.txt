    "the occurence of power - law distributions is a very common feature in nature and it is usually connected with such notions as criticality , fractals and chaotic dynamics and studied using generalized ( nonextensive ) maximum entropy formalism characterized by a nonextensivity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "such formalism leads in a natural way to power - laws in the frame of equilibrium processes @xcite . for non - equilibrium phenomena the sources of power - law distributions are self - organized criticality @xcite and stochastic multiplicative processes @xcite . in the former nonequilibrium systems are continuously driven by their own internal dynamic to a critical state with power - laws omnipresent . in the later power - law",
