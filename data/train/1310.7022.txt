    "using vlbi observations , @xcite found the angular broadening for this new highly magnetized neutron star ( magnetar ) , sgr j1745 - 29 , was in excellent agreement with that of sgr a * , indicating that both sources are behind the same scattering screen , which implies that the screen is uniform on @xmath11 pc scales .",
    "the temporal broadening , however , was much less than previously expected @xcite , and similar to pulsars discovered on larger scales ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "however , @xcite point out that observations of globular clusters find large pulsar populations despite escape velocities much smaller than the average pulsar kick velocity .",
    "this is presumably due to the larger escape velocity needed to escape binary systems , combined with high binary fractions in dense stellar environments .",
    "similar effects could weaken the impact of neutron star kicks in the gc .",
    "we conservatively adopt @xmath43 in the following , but this is likely a lower limit .",
    "the number of observable pulsars in the gc depends on the total number of pulsars ( eq . [ eq:2 ] ) , as well as the survey parameters , pulsar luminosity and period distributions , and the fraction beamed towards us ( assumed to be @xmath44 throughout ) :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the detection efficiency of ordinary pulsars in each survey .",
    "past surveys estimated low values of @xmath46 based on the large expected temporal scattering towards the gc .",

    "the @xmath22 ghz results provide the strongest constraint on the ordinary pulsar population , while the @xmath24 ghz survey may be sensitive to bright msps (  [ sec : galact - centre - mill ] ) .",
    "similar results are obtained using the sensitivity of the @xmath47 ghz survey of @xcite .",
    "we estimate @xmath46 as the fraction of known ordinary pulsars ( @xmath48 ms ) with luminosity larger than the detection threshold of each survey .",
    "the detection thresholds are extrapolated to @xmath49 ghz assuming a spectral index of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we find consistent results by instead using the observed spectral indices to extrapolate the pulsar fluxes to the frequencies of the surveys .",
    "we roughly account for possible malmquist bias in the pulsar distribution by doing the estimate separately for all and the closest @xmath51 of pulsars .",

    "@xmath56 estimated above , and @xmath57",
    "as expected , the deepest survey should have detected @xmath58 ordinary young pulsars .",
    "given an expectation value of @xmath59 , it is statistically improbable ( @xmath60 ) to have no detections .",
    "although the systematic uncertainties in this estimate are larger than the statistical ones , they are likely insufficient to explain the discrepancy ( @xmath61 for the smallest value of @xmath46 at @xmath22 ghz ) .",
    "this is especially true given our conservative choices for the retention fraction and total number of massive stars .",
    "a simple alternative estimate for the expected number of detectable pulsars can be made by scaling the number of observed pulsars ( @xmath62 ) to the fraction of galactic supernovae that occur in the gc ( @xmath63 ) : @xmath64 , consistent with the above .",
    "we conclude that there is a missing pulsar problem in the gc . at @xmath65 , an upper limit to the total number of young pulsars",
    "is @xmath66 .",
    "an alternative view of this constraint is as an upper limit to the pulsar formation efficiency of @xmath67 .",
    "that is , @xmath68 of massive stars in the gc do not form ordinary pulsars .",
    "we note that young pulsars make up a small portion of the overall population , and so there could be many more old and/or faint pulsars as discussed by @xcite .",
    "this does not change our estimates of @xmath69 or @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast to the missing pulsars , the detection of a young magnetar ( @xmath30 yr ) so close to sgr a * implies a large population of highly magnetized neutron stars in the central parsec . the expected number of observable magnetars , @xmath70 can be estimated in the same way as above , but for the much shorter magnetar lifetime :",
    "@xmath71    where the parameters are scaled to the properties of sgr j1745 - 29 and @xmath72 is the detection fraction of magnetars .",
    "we would not have expected to see a magnetar unless magnetar formation is efficient ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "long after a pulsar passes the death line it may accrete mass from a stellar companion , and be rejuvenated in an @xmath8-ray binary ( xrb ) as an msp .",
    "the process of forming msps is greatly enhanced in dense environments by dynamical encounters between neutron stars and binary stars @xcite .",
    "indeed , old , massive star clusters have some of the richest populations of msps and xrbs .",
    "@xcite found that the encounter rate and stellar mass in the gc is similar to the globular cluster terzan 5 , which has a large population of msps .",
    "they estimated that the gc population could be as large as @xmath74 total msps , accounting for its higher pulsar retention fraction .",
    "a large population of msps in the gc is further supported by the overabundance of xrbs found near sgr a * @xcite . to date",
    "this population has remained mostly unconstrained .",
    "_ fermi _ observations are consistent with up to @xmath75 msps within the central @xmath76 pc @xcite .",
    "even the relatively small degree of temporal scattering measured by @xcite precludes the efficient detection of msps at @xmath77 ghz .",
    "however , the @xcite survey at @xmath78ghz could detect the most luminous @xmath79  @xmath80 of known msps .",
    "if the gc msp population were the same as that of terzan 5 , 2 msps should have been detected by the @xcite survey .",
    "while the number of msps may be enhanced in the gc by dynamical encounters , the estimates typically assume a large population of old neutron stars with low magnetic fields .",
    "if all the neutron stars are magnetars rather than ordinary pulsars , significant field decay would be required to allow spin up to millisecond periods .",
    "despite predictions of a large pulsar population in the central parsec and several deep radio surveys , no ordinary pulsars have been detected to date .",
    "given the recent measurements of weak temporal broadening of the pulses of the magnetar sgr j1745 - 29 @xcite , previous surveys should have seen @xmath81 ordinary pulsars in the central parsec (  [ sec : observ - constr ] ) .",
    "we have argued that this discrepancy constitutes a `` missing pulsar problem '' in the galactic center .",
    "the lack of pulsars could be caused by a low formation efficiency , a low detection efficiency , or a low retention fraction of ordinary pulsars .",
    "here we address these possibilities .",
    "in particular we argue that a strong but inhomogeneous scattering medium that lowers the detection efficiency of surveys is not the most natural explanation for the missing pulsars .    _ a patchy scattering screen : _ we have assumed a uniform scattering screen across the inner parsec , as shown to fit both the temporal and angular broadening of sgr j1745 - 29 @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation suggested by @xcite is that the discovery of a rare , short - lived magnetar is evidence for a large population of ordinary pulsars as well .",
    "these pulsars may not have been seen if the small degree of temporal broadening of sgr j1745 - 29 is explained as a lucky line of sight through a much stronger but inhomogeneous scattering screen .    however , multiple lines of evidence suggest that the angular and temporal scattering may be roughly uniform on scales of tens of parsecs . @xcite",
    "found excellent agreement in the angular broadening properties of sgr j1745 - 29 and sgr a * , suggesting that the screen has a coherence length @xmath11 pc . on larger scales ,",
    "pulsars detected within @xmath82 pc have temporal scattering consistent with or less than that of sgr j1745 - 29 @xcite .",
    "similar angular broadening is seen in many oh / ir stars at separations @xmath13  @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the extragalactic source g359.87 + 0.18 @xcite has an angular size consistent with sgr a * at @xmath84 ghz , as would be expected for a uniform but distant screen .",
    "since all of the data can be explained by a uniform but distant screen , and in the absence of direct evidence for strong temporal scattering , an intrinsic deficit in the ordinary pulsar population is the more natural interpretation of the lack of detections in surveys to date",
    ".    _ detection efficiency biases : _ if the luminosity and period distributions of galactic center pulsars are similar to those detected elsewhere in the galaxy , the detection efficiency from previous surveys should be high (  [ sec : observ - constr ] ) . however",
    ", this distribution is subject to selection effects , and the true distribution could be biased to fainter pulsars .",
    "we estimate that this possible bias could contribute at the factor of a few level by separately considering only relatively nearby pulsars , which is probably insufficient to explain the lack of detections .",
    "a simple empirical estimate based on the fraction of galactic supernovae occurring in the gc also gives consistent results , and is not subject to this bias .    _",
    "neutron star kicks : _ we found that @xmath85 of the young pulsars could be expelled from the central parsec from natal kicks (  [ sec : isol - puls - kicks ] ) .",
    "this is likely an upper limit , as indicated by the large populations of pulsars in globular clusters , which have much smaller escape velocities .",
    "neutron star kicks can not explain the missing pulsar problem .    _ peculiar star and pulsar formation : _ the detection of even a single magnetar so close to sgr a * is unexpected , and implies order unity efficiency for forming magnetars from massive stars in the galactic center .",
    "this implied high magnetar efficiency is one possible explanation for the missing pulsar problem : massive stars in the central parsec may form short - lived magnetars rather than long - lived ordinary pulsars .",
    "efficient magnetar formation could be explained by an unusual progenitor population .",
    "there is some evidence that the imf in the central parsec is top - heavy @xcite , and several magnetars are associated with massive stellar progenitors ( @xmath86 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* compared to @xmath87 typically assumed for neutron stars ) .",
    "stars in the central parsec may also be highly magnetized ( e.g. , s0 - 2/s2 @xcite , see also the hypervelocity stars , @xcite ) .",
    "magnetars could also be formed from amplification of the field of a highly magnetized progenitor during core collapse @xcite .",
    "both a top - heavy imf and strong magnetic fields could be caused by rapid star formation in the dense regions near sgr a * @xcite .",
    "the star formation event leading to the currently observed massive stars in the central parsec was too recent to have formed ordinary pulsars .",
    "another explanation for missing young pulsars is that past star formation events produced fewer ( by @xmath88 ) massive stars ( e.g. , from a different imf ) .",
    "a very recent major merger between sgr a * and another massive black hole could also have removed a significant fraction of the old stars and pulsars from the central parsec . finally , it is possible that the ordinary pulsars are present , but that the pulsar emission is suppressed , e.g. , by interactions of the neutron star magnetosphere with the gc environment over the pulsar lifetime .",
    "whatever the explanation , missing pulsars and efficient magnetar formation constitute evidence that neutron star formation and evolution are substantially modified in the high density regions near a massive black hole .    the authors are listed in alphabetical order . j.d .  and r.m.o",
