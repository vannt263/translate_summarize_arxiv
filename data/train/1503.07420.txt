    "according to the recent cosmic observations our universe is experiencing an accelerating phase of expansion at the present time @xcite-@xcite . since the ordinary barionic matter ( energy ) can only produces an attractive force , there should necessarily an exotic form of energy with negative pressure called  dark energy \" ( de ) be exist in order to drive the observed cosmic acceleration @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , based on the recent observations we live in a nearly spatially flat universe composed of approximately @xmath8 baryonic matter , @xmath9 dark matter and @xmath10 dark energy .",
    "a natural candidate for dark energy is cosmological constant @xmath11 , which has the equation of state @xmath12 .",
    "however , although cosmological constant can explain the present cosmic acceleration , it would encounter some serious theoretical problems , such as the fine - tuning and the coincidence problems .",
    "another possible candidates for dark energy are the dynamic dark energy models provided by scalar fields such as quintessence @xmath13 @xcite-@xcite , phantom ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , quintom ( @xmath15 ) @xcite , k - essence @xcite , chaplygin gas as well as generalized chaplygin gas models @xcite , and etc .",
    "+ we also can study dark energy through an almost model - independent way . in this approach",
    "we parameterize the dark energy eos parameter by giving the concrete form of the equation of state of dark energy directly , such as @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite , etc .",
    "studies of dark energy as a function of redshift , by using this method , show that though the cosmological constant is not ruled out in 1@xmath18 region , the current constraints favors a dynamical dark energy .",
    "however , as noted in ref @xcite the rapid changed of eos parameter i.e @xmath19 is ruled out .",
    "moreover , it is a well established fact that the universe is accelerated expansion at present ( dark energy dominated ) and decelerated expansion in the past ( dark matter dominated ) .",
    "therefore , the deceleration parameter ( dp ) should not be a constant but time ( or redshift ) variable which is positive in the past and changes into negative at @xmath20 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "considering the idea of variable dp , the parameterized decelerated parameter is present in almost model independent way by giving a concrete form of decelerated parameters .",
    "+ the high symmetry involved in flrw models requires a very high degree of fine tuning of initial conditions which is extraordinary improbable and hence flrw models are infinitely improbable in the space of all possible cosmologies @xcite .",
    "although there are an increasing interest in the study of de in the scop of anisotropic space - times , there is not a reference paper including the present observational constraints on the observable parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath21 , @xmath4 , etc .",
    "therefore , still authors compare their results by those obtained on the bases of the standard cosmological models .",
    "motivated the situation discussed above , in this letter instead of flrw metric , an anisotropic space - time namely bianchi type i metric is used in order to obtain more general results .",
    "up to our knowledge , such kind of calculations has not been done yet .",
    "first we derive the general form of the eos parameter in bianchi type i space - time and then we use the hubble dataset , cmb data , and their combination to put the observational constraints on the model parameters .",
    "i is worth to mention that because of technical difficulties in minimizing @xmath22 the results obtained in this work are not so general and more work is needed to extend these results for example by minimizing @xmath23 .",
    "we consider the bianchi type i space - time in the orthogonal form as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are functions of time only .",
    "+ the einstein s field equations ( in gravitational units @xmath27 ) read as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the energy momentum tensors of barotropic matter and dark energy , respectively .",
    "these are given by @xmath31,\\ ] ] @xmath32\\rho^{m},\\ ] ] and @xmath33,\\ ] ] @xmath34\\rho^{x},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are , respectively the energy density and pressure of the perfect fluid component or ordinary baryonic matter while @xmath37 is its eos parameter .",
    "similarly , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are , respectively the energy density and pressure of the de component while @xmath40 is the corresponding eos parameter .",
    "we assume the four velocity vector @xmath41 satisfying @xmath42 . + in a co - moving coordinate system ( @xmath43 ) , einstein s field equations ( [ eq2 ] ) with ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) for b - i metric ( [ eq1 ] ) subsequently lead to the following system of equations : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 if we consider @xmath48 as the average scale factor of bianchi type i model , then the generalized mean hubble s parameter @xmath49 defines as @xmath50    the bianchi identity @xmath51 leads to @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the continuity equation for dark energy and baryonic matter can be written as @xmath53 solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq5]-([eq8 ] ) one can find @xcite @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 where @xmath57    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq11])-([eq13 ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq5])-([eq8 ] ) we can write the analogue of the friedmann equation as @xmath58 and @xmath59 here @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "note that @xmath63 denotes the deviation from isotropy e.g. @xmath64 represents flat flrw universe .",
    "thus , when the universe is sufficiently large , almost at the present time , the space - time ( [ eq1 ] ) behaves like a flat flrw universe .",
    "+ moreover , if there is no interaction between dark energy and cold dark matter(cdm ) with @xmath65 , then one can write the conservation equation ( [ eq10 ] ) for cdm and dark energy separately as separately as @xmath66 and @xmath67 eq.([eq16 ] ) leads to @xmath68 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) , ( [ eq18 ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) we obtain the energy density and pressure of dark fluid as @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively . here",
    ", @xmath71 is a positive constant ( note that @xmath72 ) .",
    "therefore , the equation of state parameter ( eos ) of de in it s general form is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the deceleration parameter and @xmath75 is the current value of matter density .",
    "in this section , by using @xmath22 method we investigate the constraints on the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath76 , and @xmath4 .",
    "to do so we utilize the recent observational data including hubble parameter and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "note that as mentioned by kumatsu et al @xcite the baryonic oscillation ( bao ) distance ratio is not applicable in non - flrw based models .",
    "+ first of all , from eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) we obtain the expression for the hubble rate , of the form @xmath77 in our study , following xu l x et al .",
    "@xcite , the deceleration parameter is considered to be @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are constants determined by the recent observational constraints . from this equation",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath81 , @xmath82 which is corresponding to matter dominated era whereas for @xmath83 , the current value of deceleration parameter is obtained as @xmath84 . in view of eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) , the hubble parameter is written in the form @xmath85,\\ ] ] we also consider the following simple expression for the equation of state @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are constants .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) one can easily re - write eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) as a function of @xmath89 only .",
    "+ as far as we are dealing with the experimental @xmath90 test , it has been suggested by jimenez et .",
    "al . @xcite to use the quantity @xmath91 which is called _",
    "differential age_. in this method , one can directly analyze the @xmath90 data without passing through the luminosity distance as we usually do in the case of supernovae ia . using the differential ages of passively - evolving galaxies from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds)@xcite and archival data @xcite ,",
