    "the study of exclusive hadronic @xmath5-meson decays can provide not only an interesting avenue to understand the @xmath0 violation and flavor mixing of the quark sector in the standard model ( sm ) , but also powerful means to probe different new physics ( np ) scenarios beyond the sm .",

    "the @xmath8 decays are all induced at the quark level by @xmath9 process , and they involve the same set of rpv coupling constants . using the latest experimental data and the theoretical parameters , we obtain the new upper limits on the relevant rpv couplings .",
