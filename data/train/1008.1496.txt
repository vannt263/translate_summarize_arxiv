    ", we may impose strong constraints on cosmological models @xcite . in spite of remarkable goodness of fit @xcite , there are some features of wmap data , which are not well explained by the wmap concordance model @xcite . in particular , the power contrast anomaly between even and odd multipoles is explicitly associated with the angular power spectrum , which are mainly used to fit cosmological models @xcite .",
    "having noted this , we have investigated whether even(odd ) multipole data set is consistent with the wmap concordance model .",
    "our investigation shows there exist some level of tension , which may be an indication of unaccounted contamination or missing ingredients in the assumed parametric model such as the flat @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we may consider cmb anisotropy as the sum of even and odd parity functions : @xmath1 where @xmath2 using the parity property of spherical harmonics @xmath3 @xcite , it is straightforward to show @xmath4 obviously , the power spectrum of even and odd multipoles are associated with @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "given the @xmath0cdm model , we do not expect any features distinct between even and odd multipoles .",
    "however , there have been reported power contrast between even and odd multipoles of wmap @xmath7 power spectrum @xcite . at lowest multipoles ( @xmath8 )",
    ", there is odd multipole preference ( i.e. power excess in odd multipoles and deficit in even multipoles ) @xcite , and even multipole preference at intermediate multipoles ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "additionally , we have investigated te correlation , and noticed odd multipole preference at ( @xmath10 ) and even multipole preference at ( @xmath11 ) , though its statistical significance is not high enough , due to low signal - to - noise ratio of polarization data .",
    "not surprisingly , these power contrast anomalies are explicitly associated with the angular power spectrum data , which are mainly used to fit cosmological models .",

    "we have used the wmap 7 year tt and te power spectrum data , which have been estimated from the ilc map , and cut - sky v and w band maps @xcite . it should be noted that we have used the wmap power spectrum via the wmap team s likelihood code .    in order to use only even(odd ) multipole data , we have made slight modifications to the wmap team s likelihood code , where the blackwell - rao estimator and the master pseudo - cl estimator are modified respectively for low multipoles ( @xmath13 ) and high multipoles ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "note that we have also re - derived the fisher matrix in accordance with even(odd ) multipole data subset .",
    "additionally , the beam and point source corrections are modified accordingly .",
    "hereafter , we shall denote wmap cmb data of whole , even and odd multipoles by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively . note that even / odd multipole splitting are made for tt and te power spectrum up to the multipoles of wmap sensitivity ( i.e. @xmath18 for tt and @xmath19 for te ) . using `",
