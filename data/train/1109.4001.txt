    "<S> we also present a regularization scheme independent calculation based on the gauge condition independent background field framework of vilkovisky - dewitt s effective action with focusing on both the quadratic divergence and quartic divergence that is not discussed before . with the harmonic gauge condition </S>",
    "<S> , the results computed by using the traditional background field method can consistently be recovered from the vilkovisky - dewitt s effective action approach by simply taking a limiting case , and are found to be the same as the ones yielded by the diagrammatic calculation . as a consequence , in all the calculations , the symmetry - preserving and divergent - behavior - preserving loop regularization method can consistently lead to a nontrivial gravitational contribution to the gauge coupling constant with an asymptotic free power - law running at one loop near the planck scale . </S>"
