    "very recently , we extracted @xmath8 from a measurement of the direct photon spectra in @xmath9 @xcite . to extrapolate beyond the experimentally accessible direct photon momentum region , those measurements relied on several theoretical parameterizations of the expected photon momentum spectrum in the @xmath0 system @xcite to obtain the total direct @xmath10 decay width relative to the dominant @xmath11 width .",
    "the ratio of those widths can then be used to estimate the strong coupling constant at the energy scale of the @xmath0 .",
    "these theoretical parameterizations generally neglect the contribution to the photon momentum spectrum due to two - body decays , e.g. @xmath12 , with @xmath3 some resonant hadronic state .",
    "as noted in the @xmath8 extraction , contributions from such possible two - body decays may result in a slight underestimate of the extracted value of @xmath8 .",
    "this systematic consideration in the @xmath13 analysis motivated a search for @xmath14 .",
    "we concern ourselves with high multiplicity ( @xmath15 charged tracks ) final states , as we employ the same hadronic event selection cuts in this analysis that we did in the @xmath13 analysis @xcite .",
    "we note that , although two - body branching fractions have been observed for , e.g. , @xmath0(1s)@xmath16 at the level of @xmath17 , the fraction of @xmath18 decays into @xmath194 charged tracks is only @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "our sensitivity to the @xmath18 is additionally reduced in this analysis by its large width ( compared to our typical photon energy resolution ) .    the analysis , in general terms , proceeds as follows . after selecting a high - quality sample of @xmath21 annihilations into hadrons using the hadronic event selection cuts of the previous analysis @xcite",
    ", we plot the inclusive isolated photon spectrum in data taken at both on-@xmath0-resonance and off-@xmath0-resonance energies ( the latter sample is used for systematic checks of the overall procedure )",
    ". a two - body radiative decay of the @xmath0 will produce a monochromatic photon in the lab frame ; the momentum of the radiated photon is related to the mass of the recoil hadron @xmath3 via equation  [ eq : conversion ] ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath23    assuming that the intrinsic width of the recoil hadron is much smaller than the experimental photon energy resolution , then the measured radiative photon energy should be a gaussian centered at the momentum @xmath24 .",
    "for a 1 gev ( 4.5 gev ) recoil photon , this implies a recoil mass typically much narrower than 20 mev ( 60 mev ) . not knowing",
    "_ a priori _ the mass of the hadron @xmath3 , we therefore perform a set of fits to the @xmath0(1s ) photon spectrum to a gaussian signal , centered at the value @xmath24 , and with a resolution corresponding to the known cleo - iii electromagnetic calorimeter resolution , atop smooth polynomial backgrounds , over the @xmath25 photon energy range . threshold . in the previous analysis",
    ", we also identified an excess of photons in data as @xmath26 .",
    "further examination of these events indicated that they were dominated by @xmath27 , although the possibility that the 4-pion state resulted from the decay of an intermediate resonance @xmath3 was not investigated . ]",
    "we construct 95% confidence level upper limits from these fits by adding @xmath28 to the @xmath29 distribution , where @xmath29 is the @xmath30-dependent gaussian fit area and @xmath31 is the fit error .",
    "we then recast this upper limit as a function of recoil mass @xmath7 , correct for the efficiency loss due to the fiducial acceptance of the detector ( for the purposes of this correction , it is assumed that @xmath3 is pseudo - scalar with a corresponding @xmath32 angular distribution for the recoiling @xmath33 ) and of the event and photon selection cuts that define our data sample .",
    "note that the exact form of the efficiency correction due to the event and photon selection cuts varies with the decay final states considered for @xmath3 . to be conservative",
    ", we derive our @xmath30-dependent efficiency correction from the decay mode yielding the lowest reconstruction efficiency imaginable .",
    "this final efficiency - corrected limit is converted into an @xmath7-dependent branching ratio upper limit @xmath34 by dividing the resulting yield by the calculated total number of resonant @xmath0 events . for the off - resonance running ,",
    "the distributions are divided by the off - resonance luminosity for comparison s sake .",
    "an example of simulated signal superimposed on background is given in figure  [ fig : fakesignal ] for @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    ", @xmath37 , for various hypothetical @xmath3 masses .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath38(@xmath39 , @xmath37 ) has been grossly exaggerated for the sake of presentation .",
    "the red ( dotted ) curve is @xmath40 data , while the blue ( solid ) curve is @xmath40 data with signal monte carlo added on top .",
    "from the left , the first ` bump ' corresponds to a @xmath3 of mass @xmath41 gev , the second from the left corresponds to a @xmath3 of mass @xmath42 gev , the third from the left corresponds to a @xmath3 of mass @xmath43 gev and the fourth from the left corresponds a @xmath3 of mass @xmath44 gev.,width=302 ]",
    "event selection criteria in this analysis are identical to those imposed in the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "the inclusive photon spectra are therefore identical to those taken from our previous analysis , as well .",
    "the background shape is approximately exponential in the region from @xmath25 .",
    "to extract the possible magnitude of a two - body radiative signal , we step along the inclusive photon spectrum over the interval @xmath25 , fitting it to a gaussian with width equal to the detector resolution at that value of photon energy , plus a background parametrized by a smooth chebyshyev polynomial .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic width of the resonance @xmath3 is considerably smaller than the detector resolution .",
    "our step size is determined by the energy resolution of the detector @xmath45 ; we use steps of width @xmath46 . for photons in the central `` barrel '' region of the csi electromagnetic calorimeter , at energies greater than 2 gev , the energy resolution is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the shower energy in gev .",
    "at 100 mev , the calorimetric performance is about 20% poorer than indicated by this expression due to the material in front of the calorimeter itself .    at each step",
    ", we use a @xmath4910@xmath45 fitting window ; the background is expected to be relatively smooth over such a limited interval .",
    "we use a 3rd-(2nd-)order chebyschev polynomial in the photon interval @xmath50 . for each fit , the gaussian fit area @xmath29 and fit error @xmath31 is recorded . note",
    "that the fits are highly correlated point - to - point , and that the bin width is much finer than the detector resolution . note also that we have not attempted to analytically correct for smearing - induced distortions that may result from the finite resolution of the detector ; we simply assume that the smeared spectrum can be well - described by a smooth higher - order polynomial .",
    "to convert the @xmath29 distribution obtained from fitting the inclusive photon spectrum into a one - sided upper 95% confidence interval upper limit , we add @xmath28 point - wise to the @xmath29 distribution , as a function of photon momentum . in this process , since we are interested in enhancements in the inclusive photon spectrum , all negative areas from the raw fits are set equal to @xmath28 at these points .",
    "the resulting contour for the @xmath51 fitting is shown in figure  [ fig : rawupperlimit1s ] .",
    "versus @xmath30 for fits to the @xmath51 inclusive photon spectrum , where negative points have been mapped to @xmath28.,width=302 ]    we convert the limits as a function of photon energy @xmath30 into a function of a hypothetical resonance recoil mass @xmath7 via equation  [ eq : conversion ] . for the purposes of this conversion",
    "the mean values for each running period of @xmath52 are used for each data sample ; we neglect the mev - scale variation in beam energies for a particular run period .",
    "these values are given in table  i.    [ tab : beamenergies ]    .the mean values of @xmath52 for each data sample used in this analysis , used to map our upper limit contour from a function of @xmath30 to a function of @xmath7 . [",

    "in order to ensure that we are able to identify a signal at a given sensitivity level , we embedded pure monte carlo signal in data , and performed our fitting procedure on the resulting distribution in order to ensure that we recovered the correct signal magnitude in our branching ratio upper limit . to do this , @xmath35 , @xmath36 events were embedded in the @xmath40 inclusive photon spectrum with branching ratios of the order of @xmath53 , @xmath17 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , under @xmath56 different @xmath7 hypotheses : @xmath57 gev , @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 gev , @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 gev and @xmath66 gev .",
