    "entanglement , a property at the heart of quantum mechanics , has first been brought to scientific debate by the intriguing questions posed by einstein , podolsky , and rosen @xcite and since then the matter has always been under investigation .",
    "several years ago , the interest of the physical community in this counterintuitive property has been raised even more due to its potential as a resource for information processing and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the growing interest in the area of quantum information opened questions also in mathematics as well as propelled the development of high precision experiments in several areas of physics ( condensed matter , quantum optics , and atomic physics ) just to quote a few . in order to realize the goal of quantum computation",
    "several important issues must be addressed .",
    "it thus has become clear that the search for entangled states or classes of entangled states constitutes an important subject .",
    "clearly understanding systems involving many entangled degrees of freedom is also an important part of quantum computation .",
    "therefore , much work has been devoted to the subject in the recent literature @xcite . in @xcite",
    "is presented a scheme to experimental detection of genuine multipartite entanglement using entanglement witness operators .",
    "this method was applied to three and four - qubit entangled states of polarized photons , giving experimental evidence that the considered states contain true multipartite entanglement .",
    "multipartite qubit systems have also been considered in @xcite .",
    "relevant new features appearing in multipartite systems as compared to bipartite measures are highlighted together with an outline of how to experimentally measure multipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "a notion of generalized concurrence called genuine multipartite entanglement ( gme ) concurrence @xcite was introduced in the attempt to distinguish between gme and partial entanglement and it was pointed out that gme concurrence of pure states may be directly accessible in laboratory experiments .",
    "many - particle systems , as far as their entanglement , are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and a brief review of the bipartite measures of entanglement and the entanglement of pairs both for systems of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles are shown . in this reference",
    "the concept of genuine multipartite entanglement is introduced and an approach for the construction of genuine multipartite entanglement measures is presented .",
    "solid mathematical results regarding multipartite entanglement are only available for pure three - qubit systems @xcite . in this case",
    "the existence of what is called residual entanglement , not detectable by two - qubit entanglement quantifiers , has been proved @xcite . to the residual entanglement , in ref .",
    "@xcite , was showed that in any arbitrary three partitions of a many - body system a residual entanglement is always present . in this context",
    "there appears two very distinct regimes governed by the overlap between the states in the superposition .    in this work",
    "we will extend the discussion that was began in the ref .",
    "@xcite to deal with the dynamics of the concurrence of a many - body system . in that previous paper ,",
    "the discussion was focused in the residual entanglement between the partitions of the system .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , the purpose of the present contribution is to shed some light on the dynamical properties of entanglement . in this paper",
    ", we will study the dynamics among the environment oscillators .",
    "we will show that even without a direct interaction among the environment oscillators , they entangle with one another .",
    "we consider a system constituted by a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to @xmath0 other oscillators ; see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where the operators @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) correspond to annihilation ( creation ) operators of the main oscillator and of the environment oscillator , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 correspond to the frequency of the main oscillator and of the environment oscillator .",
    "the symbol @xmath8 is a coupling constant between the main oscillator and the @xmath9 oscillator of the environment with @xmath10 .",
    "as the first step to solve exactly the hamiltonian above , in higher - dimensional quantum systems , we will consider the initial state of the main oscillator in a coherent state @xmath11 and each given oscillator of the environment in the vacuum state @xmath12 .",
    "the initial state of the global system in this manner is given by @xmath13 for any time later the state of the system has the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are coherent states for any time later of the main oscillator and of the environment respectively .",
    "the dynamic of the amplitudes @xmath17 and @xmath18 can be obtained by using ( [ estado_final_fatorado ] ) in the schrdinger equation @xmath19 by using the equation given by eq .",
    "( [ estado_final_fatorado ] ) and developing the left side of the schrdinger equation we obtain the following set of equations : @xmath20 where we express @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the form @xmath21 in the set of equations above @xmath22 and @xmath23 are amplitudes that contain information about the number of the excitations in each subsystems and @xmath24 is a detuning between the main oscillator and the environment oscillators . to understand the meaning of @xmath22 and @xmath23 we will discuss the distribution of excitations between the main oscillator and of the environment .",
    "the unitary evolution given by the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltoniano ] ) preserves the total excitation number and therefore the number of excitation in the main oscillator plus the excitations in the @xmath0 other will be conserved throughout evolution . in order to discuss the dynamics of excitations we will consider the initial state of the main oscillator in a coherent state @xmath11 and each given oscillator of the environment in the vacuum state @xmath12 . the initial excitation number average of the global system in this manner is given by @xmath25 for any time later there is some transfer of excitation between the main oscillator and the environment and therefore the excitation number average of the global system is given by @xmath26 using ( [ alpha_01 ] ) and ( [ lambda_01 ] ) it can be shown that @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 . using now ( [ exc_princ ] ) and ( [ exc_banho ] ) in ( [ n0 ] ) we have @xmath30 recalling that the initial state of the system is given by @xmath31 , consequently we obtain @xmath32 in the right side of eq .",
    "( [ prob_exc ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 contain information about the normalized number of the excitation in each subsystem .",
    "in fact , one may say that the system dynamic is completely given by these parameters and the initial state of the system . to estimate these parameters we need to solve the set of equations given by ( [ dif_f_01 ] ) and ( [ dif_g_01 ] ) .    from now on , the system of units is chosen so that @xmath35 , and the values of all physical quantities below are given with respect to this system .",
    "the environment is composed of a set of oscillators with equally spaced frequencies @xmath36 varying in the range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , see fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , and the coupling constant @xmath39 . in the distribution shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) there is at least one oscillation of environment in resonance with the main oscillator ( @xmath40 ) . in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , we show the exchange of excitation between the main oscillator and the environment .",
    "as expected , the environment removes all excitations of the main oscillator .",
    "note that , the curve of the main oscillator resembles an exponential decay , like a typical markovian behavior , where the system of interest loses excitation to the environment without recovering them .",
    "the two curves are complementary so that their sum is equal to @xmath41 , agreeing thereby with the conservation of number of excitations .      in dynamics described by fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) it shows that after some time the environment removes all excitations of the main oscillator .",
    "so , we hope that , the interaction between the main oscillator and the environment creates correlations among the environment oscillators",
    ". we will now discuss the excitations in the environment and to do so we divide the environment into multiple partitions and after that we will see how the excitations are distributed among these partitions .",
    "we divide the environment into @xmath42 partitions with @xmath43 oscillators each . in each partition half of the oscillators has a higher frequency , while the other half has a low frequency in comparison to frequency of the main oscillator .",
    "figure ( [ fig4 ] ) shows how this partition was made and fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) shows how the excitations evolves in these partitions .",
    "initially there are some oscillations that occur because during this time the main excitation oscillator exchange with the environment .",
    "therefore , while the excitations are being distributed to the environment oscillators , these ones exchange excitations with each other through the main oscillator .",
    "after that , all excitations are transferred to the environment , the system is stabilized and there are not exchange of excitations .",
    "therefore , the average number of excitations for each partition is constant .",
    "until now we have studied the dynamics of the system . it was obtained the equations of motion and calculated the @xmath33 e @xmath34 functions .",
    "we discussed how the excitations are transferred from the main oscillator to the environment and how they are distributed in the environment after that the system is stabilized . in dynamics described by fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) it shows that after some time the environment removes all excitations of the main oscillator and fig . ( [ fig5 ] ) shows how the excitations evolves in the partitions of the environment . since that all the excitations",
    "are contained in the environment we hope that there is some entanglement between the environment partitions .",
    "thus , we can study the dynamics of entanglement between the environment partitions . in order to investigate the dynamics of entangled states",
    "we will consider the initial state of the system given by @xmath44 with the initial state of the main oscillator in a coherent superposition of coherent states and each oscillator of the environment in a vacuum state .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath45 are arbitrary complex number and @xmath46 is a normalization constant given by @xmath47 the time evolution of this initial state ( [ estado_inicial_fatorado2 ] ) is given by @xmath48 with latexmath:[\\ ] ] in order to characterize this entanglement we will rewrite the concurrence used by wootters to describe entanglement of formation of an arbitrary state of two qubit @xcite in terms of distinguishability of the states of systems .",
    "however , we are working with coherent states , which are non - orthogonal states . to obtain the concurrence in this case we have to write these states in terms of an orthonormal base",
    "( [ conc_globadem ] ) in [ appendixa ] ] . from eq.([mdkj2 ] ) the concurrence can be write in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the distinguishability of the state @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) of the partition b ( partition c ) of the environment .",
    "the function @xmath67 is a reflex of `` distinguishability '' between the states @xmath68 and @xmath69 and if the overlap between the states @xmath68 and @xmath69 is close to unity the distinctness comes close to zero and the concurrence which is directly proportional to this tends to disappear @xcite .",
    "the distinguishability between two coherent states can be written as @xmath70 from ( [ exc_princ ] ) and ( [ exc_banho ] ) @xmath71 note that , in the eq.([cbanho ] ) there is a term in the expression of concurrence that refers to a subsystem which is outside of the system of interest .",
    "the external contribution term involves the @xmath33 that is directly related to the dynamics of excitations of the main oscillator . according to eq .",
    "( [ cbanho ] ) , the concurrence depends on the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "these functions are related to the dynamics of excitations of the partitions @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively , and therefore , vary with the number of oscillators and the frequency band of each partition .",
    "we will analyze the case where the partition @xmath74 is centered on the frequency of the main oscillator , while the partition @xmath75 is complementary to the first .",
    "figure ( [ fig6 ] ) illustrates how this division has been made and the figures ( [ fig7])-([fig9 ] ) show how the excitations vary in these partitions .",
    "+     +    in fig .",
    "( [ fig10 ] ) we plot the evolution of the concurrence to the cases above and it may be observed that in the case that the partition @xmath74 contains @xmath43 oscillators the system gets entangled much more than in the case that the partition @xmath74 contains @xmath76 oscillators .    to understand this behavior , we will return to concurrence expression . since we are interested in the situation where all excitation are contained in the environment , @xmath77 , the eq .",
    "( [ cbanho ] ) reduces to the form : @xmath78 if @xmath72 or @xmath73 are close to zero , the distinguishability is close to zero , therefore the concurrence tends to zero .",
    "looking at the case where the partition @xmath74 contains @xmath76 oscillators , we see through fig .",
    "( [ fig9 ] ) that @xmath73 is near zero .",
    "so , in this case , the distinguishability of the states of the oscillators partition @xmath75 is small .",
    "therefore , the system state approaches a separable state . in this way , these two subsystems are little tangled , as can seen in the ( c ) curve in fig.([fig10 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath72 is close to @xmath73 the distinguishability approaches its maximum value .",
    "we see that in the cases studied , the situation where the two functions appear to be closer is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig7 ] ) , where partition @xmath74 contains @xmath43 oscillators . as in this situation ,",
    "the states of each part of the environment are more distinguishable , the entanglement between the two parties becomes greater ( see the ( a ) curve in fig.([fig10 ] ) ) .",
    "note that , in accordance with equation ( [ cbanho2 ] ) , in the case that @xmath79 , the concurrence reaches the value one . that is , if we could separate the environment into two parts , so that the average number of excitations in each of the parts are equal , these two subsystems are maximally entangled .",
    "we observed , in this situation , that entanglement was maximum when each subsystem had the same average number of excitations .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "( [ fig10 ] ) , we see that the concurrence is constant after some time . after this time , all the excitations are contained in the environment and",
    "the main oscillator is in the vacuum state .",
    "when this happens , the system dynamics dies .",
    "the system is stabilized and there is no exchange of excitations , even among the environment oscillators .",
    "therefore , the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 remain constant , and consequently the concurrence too .",
    "note that initially the environment oscillator were uncorrelated , there was no entanglement among them .",
    "when interacting with the main oscillator , they correlate .",
    "so this interaction with the main oscillator creates correlations among the environment oscillators .",
    "the superposition of the initial state is transferred to the states of the environment oscillators making them tangled .",
    "it has been considered here a many - body system consisting of a harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to @xmath0 others and solved the corresponding dynamical problem analytically .",
    "the interaction between the main oscillator and the environment creates correlations among the environment oscillators .",
    "initially the environment oscillators were uncorrelated , there was no entanglement among them .",
    "after the interaction , the superposition of the initial state is transferred to the states of the environment creates correlations among the environment oscillators .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of entanglement among of the environment oscillators .",
    "the entanglement between any two environment partitions was quantified and it showed that in the case that @xmath72 is close to @xmath73 the entanglement between the two parties becomes greater .",
    "that is , if we could separate the environment into two parts , so that the average number of excitations in each of the parts are equal , these two subsystems are maximally entangled .",
    "we observed , in this situation , that entanglement was maximum when each subsystem had the same average number of excitations .",
