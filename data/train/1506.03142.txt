    "the aim of this paper is to explore the effects of noise and delays on the dynamics in complex and random networks @xcite , specifically on the extreme fluctuations .",

    "the scaling behavior of extreme fluctuations in the case of zero time delay has been investigated previously for small - world ( sw ) @xcite and scale - free ( sf ) networks @xcite , as well as low - dimensional regular topologies @xcite . despite having more complex interaction topologies , coordination and synchronization phenomena of the former systems ( as far as critical behavior",
