    "in this note we present what we perceive to be an intuitive explanation of the familiar fact that gravity is not a renormalizable quantum field theory . since this is somehow the place where gravity and quantum mechanics clash , we felt that even though this is by now textbook material , some people ( particularly students and postdocs ) , may benefit from its exposition in the way done in this note .",
    "the crux of the argument , which appears e.g. in @xcite , is one line long and here it is : * the very - high energy spectrum of any @xmath0-dimensional quantum field theory is that of a @xmath0-dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "this is not true for gravity . *",

    "we felt that real understanding had to go through a crash course in wilsonian renormalization , explaining some facts about conformal field theories and finally pointing out why as a simple consequence of black hole thermodynamics gravity can not be a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "the structure of this note is the following .",
    "we start in section [ secren ] by giving a crash course in wilsonian renormalization . in section [ secgrav ]  we discuss the perturbative irrelevance of the gravitational coupling which is the basis for the standard non - renormalization argument . in section [ seccft ]  we discuss some relevant aspects of the density of states in conformal field theory . in section [ secarg ]  we present the argument for the non - renormalizability of gravity , based on black hole entropy considerations .",
    "we conclude in section [ secconc ] .",
    "it turns out to be a fact of nature that the low energy behavior of many systems is largely independent of the details of what goes on in higher energy scales .",
    "for example , you need not worry about feynman diagrams when analyzing the physics of waves in water .",
    "you need not even worry about atoms .",
    "the navier - stokes equations , formulated in the approximation of a continuous medium , are enough .",
    "the actual physical theory describing the molecules and their interaction does creep in through determining various coefficients in the low energy theory ( e.g. the viscosity coefficient ) .",
    "however , once this quantity has been measured one can use the navier - stokes equation to make predictions about the propagation of waves in water and not worry about the underlying theory .",
    "those coarse grained descriptions applicable at low energies are called _ low energy effective field - theories .",

    "a standard example is the 1-loop correction to the mass in scalar @xmath1 @xmath2 for some constant @xmath3 .",
    "the reason we got this meaningless answer was the insistence on integrating all the way to infinity in momentum space .",
    "this does not make sense physically because our quantum field theory description is bound to break at some point , if not sooner then definitely in each spacetime point . strictly within quantum field theory",
    "we can excite this degree of freedom to arbitrarily high energies .",

    "but having done that , we run into trouble with quantum mechanics , because usually , the regularized theory is no longer unitary ( since we arbitrarily removed part of the phase space to which there was associated a non - zero amplitude . ) we therefore want to imagine a process of removing the cutoff but leaving behind `` something that makes sense .

    "@xmath135 in this case the @xmath136 are lorentz transformations in @xmath0 dimensions and @xmath137 corresponds to dilatations .",
    "fields are labelled by their lorentz representation and scaling dimension @xmath14 . *",
    "@xmath138 this is a quantization on @xmath139 ( the temporal direction is the universal cover of the @xmath140 component ) .",
    "it is the natural choice in the operator formalism which makes a distinction between space and time . in this decomposition fields",
    "are labelled by their energy @xmath141 ( the eigenvalue under @xmath140 translations , not to be confused with the time direction in @xmath142 ) , and by spin quantum numbers associated with the sphere .",
    "the two choices are related by the conformal symmetry .",
    "starting from @xmath139 and continuing to euclidean signature the metric is @xmath143 ( with @xmath144 being the radius of the sphere ) .",
    "this is conformally equivalent to the metric on the euclidean plane @xmath145 if we set @xmath146 . from this relation",
    "we see that the hamiltonian @xmath147 on @xmath139 maps to the dilatation operator @xmath148 on @xmath142 .",
    "the relation between the quantum numbers is given by @xmath149 .",
    "conformal invariance substantially simplifies some aspects of finite temperature field theory . since the zero temperature field theory has no dimensionful scales in itself the temperature sets the scale for all dimensionful quantities .",
    "using dimensional analysis and the extensivity of the energy and the entropy in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions it follows that in any conformal field theory the energy ( on @xmath139 ) and entropy obey @xmath150 where @xmath151 are some numerical coefficients . solving for the entropy as a function of the energy one gets @xmath152 in the next section we compare this with the high energy spectrum of gravity .",
    "as was thoroughly explained in the first part of this note , if general relativity was a renormalizable quantum field theory then its extreme high energy behavior should be that of a conformal field theory in the appropriate number of dimensions .",
    "however , our experience with gravity has shown that once enough energy is concentrated in a given region a black hole will form . as far as our understanding goes , the high energy spectrum of gr is dominated by black holes .",
    "more technically , it is expected that in theories of gravity , black holes will provide the dominant contribution to the large energy asymptotics of the density of states as a function of the energy .    in asymptotically flat @xmath0 dimensional spacetime",
    "there is a black hole solution generalizing the schwarzschild solution @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 is the ( adm ) energy of the black hole state .",
    "the horizon is thus at @xmath156 and the entropy as a function of the energy is given by the bekenstein - hawking formula @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the volume of the horizon and @xmath119 is the d - dimensional planck length .",
    "in this case @xmath159 in contrast  is bigger than one , rendering the specific heat negative which reflects the thermodynamical instability of schwarzschild black holes .",
    "in contrast , the exponent in eq . [ cfts ]  is smaller than one , resulting in a positive specific heat . ] to eq .",
    "it therefore follows that the large energy asymptotics of the density of states in a theory of gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime is not that of any conformal field theory , and therefore , it is not a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) space ( the maximally symmetric solution to einstein s equations with a _ negative _ cosmological constant @xmath160 ) also admits black hole solutions of the form @xmath161 but in this case the function is @xmath162 at distances much smaller than the ads curvature radius @xmath163 this is almost the schwarzschild solution ( eq .[grn ] ) , but asymptotically it is very different .",
    "the horizon is at the larger solution to @xmath164 .",
    "asymptotically @xmath165 the horizon sits at @xmath166 so that the entropy is @xmath167 therefore , in this case @xmath168 .",
    "again , comparing this with eq .",
    "[ cfts ]  the conclusion is that gravity in @xmath0-dimensional ads spacetime does not have the correct density of states for a @xmath169dimensions conformal field theory and so can not be a renormalizable quantum field theory in that sense .",
    "however , there is a surprise here .",
    ". [ adsbh ] , gives the correct dependence for a conformal field theory _ but in one less spacetime dimension_. this is a consequence of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite  which claims a complete equivalence , or duality , between quantum gravity in ads space and a conformal field theory ( without gravity ) defined , in a precise sense that will not be explained here , on the boundary of the ads space .",
    "ads / cft itself is a manifestation of a modern guiding principle in quantum gravity called `` holography '' @xcite .",
    "the case of de sitter space ( the maximally symmetric solution to einstein s equations with a _ positive _ cosmological constant ) , which seems to be the one relevant for our universe is much less well understood .",
    "for once , it is not compatible with supersymmetry which was a main tool in the advancement of our understanding in other cases .",
    "there are reasons to suspect that quantum gravity in ds space may not exist in its own right , perhaps only as a meta - stable state in another theory@xcite .",
    "in this note we tried to give a concise and hopefully intuitive explanation to the fact that gravity is not a renormalizable quantum field theory .",
    "the basic reason is that the asymptotic density of states in gravity is dominated by black holes .",
    "this leads to a behavior qualitatively different from all quantum field theories .",
    "a concern that was repeatedly raised after the appearance of the first version of this note is that the black hole argument is an artifact of the low energy approximation , so that  strongly coupled gravity \" has no black - holes and therefore may still be asymptotically safe .",
    "we believe this counter - argument does not hold because the asymptotic safety scenario is based on the assumption that gravity is a valid low energy approximation to some putative local quantum field theory . therefore at least in its regime of validity it should be trusted .",
    "in particular it should be trusted to describe the horizons of large black holes , since as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ grn ] the _ more _ massive a black hole is , the _ lower _ is the curvature at the horizon .",
    "but the bekenstein - hawking formula tells us that the density of states deduced from this valid approximation has a feature that is clearly in contradiction with any quantum field theory .",
    "therefore , to argue against the non - renormalizability of gravity is really to argue against the validity of the bekenstein - hawking formula , which is an uphill battle .",
    "this is so much more so when taking into account the ads / cft correspondence which verifies the bekenstein - hawking entropy counting in the case of asymptotically ads space , and presents a clear counter example to the idea that quantum gravity is a non - trivial fixed point .",
    "we thank riccardo argurio , stephen adler , tom banks , michael dine , howard haber and asad naqvi for comments on the manuscript .",
