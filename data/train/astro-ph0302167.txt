    "modern observations favor a dark component of the cosmological energy density responsible for the present accelerating expansion rate of the universe @xcite .",
    "quintessence is a proposed model for this component in which a scalar field slowly evolves towards the minimum of its potential @xcite .",
    "as the quintessence field , @xmath0 , nears this minimum and the density of matter , @xmath1 , simultaneously decreases , the expansion rate will naturally start to accelerate . making @xmath0 dynamic alleviates the large discrepancy between the energy densities of radiation , matter and dark energy , most evident during the early universe .",
    "the evolution of such a scalar field depends entirely on its potential @xmath2 .",
    "several potentials have been proposed and investigated , two in particular have gained interest because of their simplicity : the inverse - power law ( ipl ) , @xmath3 @xcite , and the exponential , @xmath4 , @xcite . both of these potentials possess attractor - like solutions such that a broad range of initial conditions converge to a unique solution at late times @xcite . typically , during its evolution the ratio of the energy density in @xmath0 to the critical density of the universe , @xmath5 , at a fixed redshift is larger than the energy density of the pure cosmological constant it hopes to replace , regardless of the potential used . in some cases , for example the exponential potential ,",
    "the energy density during the early universe may be large to affect big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "but in other models , such as the ipl , @xmath6 is a small and slowly increasing contributor of the energy density until close to the present time when @xmath7",
    ".    probes like bbn , the cosmic - microwave background ( cmb ) , type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) , and large scale structure ( lss ) place restrictions on the parameters appearing in a potential . by combining cmb ,",
    "sn ia , and lss data , bean & melchiorri obtained a limit on the current equation of state of the field , @xmath8 , of @xmath9 ( at @xmath10 ) @xcite . in the ipl model these results led to the conclusion that the exponent for the power law , @xmath11 , must be @xmath12 at 95% confidence @xcite .",
    "similar results were found in corasaniti and copeland @xcite , leading these authors to all but rule out ipl models .",
    "doran , lilley , and wetterich @xcite combined cmb and lss data and found that ipl models with @xmath13 were favored while yahiro _",
    "et al _ @xcite determined that bbn can constrain tracker models with a conservative bound on the equation of state , @xmath14 , and a more stringent bound on the initial energy density , @xmath15 .",
    "et al _ note that bbn provides a better constraint for models in which @xmath0 does not track at this epoch , limiting larger @xmath6 in these models .",
    "all these previous limits are derived from the assumption that @xmath0 has reached its tracker solution before the cosmological test is applied . in this paper",
    "we examine the range of initial conditions of the ipl potential that lead to an evolution for @xmath0 that _ does not _",

    "we begin by discussing the ipl model for quintessence and its tracker solution in section [ sec : tracker ] , with emphasis on the initial conditions of this solution . in section  [ sec : nontracker ] we proceed to examine non - tracker solutions and the behavior of @xmath0 when the initial conditions vary significantly from the tracker solution . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : cmbsn ia ] we re - derive the constraints on the parameters in the potential by using the cmb and sn ia observations when the tracker initial conditions are used , then we will examine how the constraints on the potential parameters are altered when the initial conditions are altered .    throughout this paper",

    "whenever we require numerical values for the cosmological parameters we choose @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "our focus in this paper is initial conditions and how they affect of quintessence at late times . since we will frequently make comparisons of the solution calculated from arbitrary initial conditions with the ` tracker ' solutions we begin with a derivation of the properties of the latter .    as with all the non - interacting fluid components in the universe",

    "the equation of motion for @xmath0 is simply @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the derivative of the potential with respect to @xmath0 .",

    "they are all equivalent of course . for us",
    "the direction we take is to introduce the equation of state @xmath29 as the ratio of the quintessence pressure to its energy density and @xmath30 as the ratio of the quintessence and remaining fluid energy densities .",
    "for these two quantities we can derive from equations ( [ eq : rhodot ] ) through ( [ eq : equation of motion ] ) two first order , coupled , equations @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the equation of state for the remaining fluid components , @xmath24 is the scale factor , and @xmath33 is simply @xmath34 .",

    "these four parameters are not , however , independent because the present state of the universe is implicit in @xmath22 and @xmath42 .",
    "to calculate @xmath22 we need to specify the energy densities of the fluid components at all epochs : for the quintessence we can simply construct this quantity according to equation ( [ eq : rhoq ] ) , while for radiation and matter this can be done by their simple scaling with @xmath24 along with knowledge of their present energy densities .",
    "the contributions to the current radiation density include the measured temperature of the cmb , and the calculated energy density for three , non - degenerate neutrino flavors .",
    "this leaves only the present matter density , which is usually expressed as the product of its density parameter @xmath43 and the present critical density @xmath44 .",
    "if we impose the requirement of flatness then we must have @xmath45 at the present time .",
    "we have thus specified the value that @xmath5 must reach at the end of our integration thereby introducing a constraint and eliminating one degree of freedom .",
    "if we regard the initial values for @xmath35 and @xmath8 as inputs , and take @xmath11 ( @xmath41 ) as the remaining free variable , then we must adjust @xmath41 ( @xmath11 ) to produce a self - consistent cosmology .    the equations ( [ eq : dalphada ] ) and ( [ eq : dwda ] ) for @xmath35 and @xmath8 are clearly non - linear but certain cases are open to analysis .",
    "in particular , we can look at the situations when either derivative is zero and then examine whether these conditions are stationary . from equation ( [ eq : dalphada ] ) we find that trivially @xmath46 when @xmath47 and obviously this is stationary since all higher derivatives of @xmath35 with respect to the scale factor vanish .",
    "there is also a second solution that occurs when @xmath48 independent of the value of @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath42 is a constant then to be stationary we require @xmath49 to be also independent of the scale factor but , as we will show below , this only occurs in the limit @xmath50 .    for equation ( [ eq : dwda ] ) ,",
    "@xmath51 occurs when @xmath52 ; the @xmath53 case is clear from equation ( [ eq : dwda ] ) , while the @xmath54 solution arises because @xmath55 in such circumstances .",
    "these extrema for the equation of state are only stationary for certain potentials because they require either constant zero kinetic energy ( @xmath53 ) or potential energy ( @xmath54 ) . for the ipl they are impossible to achieve exactly but",
    "@xmath52 can be approached in the limit when @xmath6 is dominated by either @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "there is also a third solution that occurs when @xmath58 , and neither has unity magnitude .",
    "the equality only occurs for specific values of @xmath35 and @xmath8 and to be stationary this third solution requires a balance between the scale factor dependence of the @xmath59 and @xmath60^{1/\\gamma}$ ] terms in equation ( [ eq : v2 ] ) , i.e. @xmath61^{1/\\gamma } = constant.\\ ] ] this result is equivalent to equation ( 5 ) of @xcite . inserting the definition for @xmath35 this transforms into @xmath62 with the subscript @xmath63 denoting initial values .",
    "but if @xmath8 and @xmath42 are constant then from equation ( [ eq : dalphada ] ) we also have @xmath64 thus we have two equations involving @xmath35 , ( [ eq : constant ] ) and ( [ eq : tracker alpha ] ) , which must be self consistent in their scaling with @xmath24 . taking the limit @xmath50 in equation ( [ eq : constant ] ) leads to @xmath35 varying very slowly with the scale factor , and therefore from equation ( [ eq : tracker alpha ] ) , @xmath65 .",
    "this result validates our previous statement regarding the stability of @xmath66 .",
    "alternatively , taking the limit @xmath67 in equation ( [ eq : constant ] ) and equating it with equation ( [ eq : tracker alpha ] ) produces the requirement that @xmath68 for this case .",
    "as noted by steinhardt , wang and zlatev @xcite , @xmath69 so that from equation ( [ eq : tracker alpha ] ) we see that @xmath35 increases with the evolution of the universe . these solutions where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the ` tracker ' solutions originally named by steinhardt , wang and zlatev @xcite and zlatev , wang and steinhardt @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these solutions are stable attractors for all positive values of @xmath11 in that perturbations away from this solution are damped . as we stated explicitly , this epoch of constant @xmath8 only occurs when @xmath42 is also constant so if we allow more than one component for the background fluid then whenever the universe transits from domination by one component to another there will be a period during which @xmath72 . finally ,",
    "if @xmath8 is constant during an epoch , the energy density of @xmath0 scales as @xmath73 from which , after using the definition of the equation of state , equation ( [ eq : trackerw ] ) and the scale factor - time relation , we can obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the value of the field at the initial time @xmath76 .",
    "this is the result obtained by liddle and scherrer @xcite .",
    "for quintessence to be a viable explanation for the current epoch of acceleration , it must have recently come to dominate the energy density of the universe , i.e. the universe is transiting between matter domination to dark energy domination . in such circumstances",
    "the analytic solution in equation ( [ eq : q(t ) ] ) is no longer valid and the equation of state is no longer a constant .",
    "but there is still a solution to which all others converge and we shall continue to refer to this solution as the ` tracker ' even if the evolution of @xmath0 is no longer given by equation ( [ eq : q(t ) ] ) and the name no longer justified in its original sense .",
    "the appeal of ipl models of quintessence is not that the analytic equation for the tracker is always valid or that @xmath77 is always zero but rather that a wide range of initial conditions converge to a common solution thereby avoiding any fine tuning of the initial values of @xmath35 and @xmath8 .",
    "we shall discuss further how the tracker is approached in the next section , for now we will assume that the initial conditions are exactly those of the tracker solution .",
    "the tracker solutions correspond to specific initial values of @xmath35 and @xmath8 , the latter stems from equation ( [ eq : trackerw ] ) while the former can be derived from the requirement @xmath58 and equation ( [ eq : v2 ] ) .",
    "since the initial conditions are fixed the tracker solution is a function of only one parameter , @xmath11 .",
    "we start integrating the equations at an initial scale factor @xmath78 of @xmath79 : this initial value for the scale factor is , of course , arbitrary and we have checked that our results are not sensitive to its value .",
    "= 3.3 in    = 3.3 in    figure ( [ fig : alphai_versus_gamma ] ) shows the initial tracker value of @xmath35 at our choice for the initial scale of @xmath79 as a function of @xmath11 the figure shows that @xmath80 grows rapidly as @xmath11 increases so that even modest values of @xmath11 raise the initial dark energy density by many orders of magnitude above the cosmological constant value . in figure ( [ fig : final_w_tracker_versus_gamma ] ) we have plotted the equation of state at the present time as a function of @xmath11 , together with the value during both matter and radiation domination as given by equation ( [ eq : trackerw ] ) .",
    "this figure can be used to derive an upper limit of @xmath11 based simply on the requirement that the universe be accelerating at the present time . to accelerate in a flat universe we must satisfy @xmath81",
    "so with our adopted value of @xmath82 we find @xmath83 .",
    "if we use the bean & melchiorri @xmath84 limit of @xmath85 ( though this was obtained by assuming @xmath8 is constant ) then the limit drops to @xmath86 .",
    "the equation of state of the tracker at the present time is somewhat sensitive to the adopted energy density @xmath5 .",
    "larger @xmath5 leads to slightly smaller @xmath8 for a given exponent so that enforcing @xmath81 leads to a limit on @xmath11 that rises slightly more quickly with @xmath5 than figure ( [ fig : final_w_tracker_versus_gamma ] ) would seem to indicate .",
    "most previous studies of cosmological constraints on the ipl model potential have assumed that @xmath0 reached the tracker long before the epoch at which the tests are applied .",
    "this is justified since the appeal of the ipl model is the fact that @xmath0 reaches this solution for many initial conditions .",
    "since the initial conditions for @xmath0 are the focus of this paper , it seems reasonable to ask what are the ` natural ' initial conditions for @xmath0 .",
    "malquarti & liddle @xcite followed a quintessence field with an ipl potential during inflation and determined that due to quantum fluctuations @xmath0 will diffuse to a very low energy density compared to the background fluid at the end of inflation . in this scenario @xmath0",
    "is decoupled from all other fluid components , including the inflaton . during inflation ,",
    "the small scale set by @xmath41 in the @xmath0 potential implies that the inflaton field dominated the dynamics of the universe . only for small values of @xmath0",
    "could the dynamics of the universe be affected by quintessence .",
    "however , these authors found that at the end of inflation , @xmath6 is initially so small that the field does not reach the tracker until the relatively late stages of cosmic evolution .",
    "alternatively we have initial conditions for @xmath0 motivated from inflation where the scalar inflaton field , @xmath87 , transits through a period of kinetic energy domination after inflation .",
    "the epoch in which the kinetic energy of the scalar field dominates the expansion rate has been called ` kination'@xcite .",
    "previous authors have attempted to connect the scalar field in quintessence to the field responsible for inflation , by transiting the field through a kinetic energy dominated regime @xcite .",
    "if the scalar field , here responsible for both inflation and quintessence ( i.e. @xmath88 ) , does go through a period of kination , this period must end by bbn so that the universe is radiation dominated at this stage @xcite .",
    "this allows us to constrain the energy in @xmath0 after inflation .",
    "starting from the scaling relation for temperature , @xmath89 , as well as the scaling relations @xmath90 and @xmath91 during kination , and expressing the relativistic energy as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 counts the total number of relativistic degrees of freedom , we obtain @xmath94 for the energy in @xmath87 at the end of inflation . here",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath96 are the temperatures at the end of inflation and at the end of kination , respectively , and @xmath97 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , in order to satisfy the nucleosynthesis bound , the temperature of particles created during kination just after thermal equilibrium is achieved is @xmath98 gev . since @xmath99 , we can take @xmath100 gev to be a very generous lower bound for @xmath95 , which in ( [ eq : phi_i ] ) gives @xmath101 .",
    "thus it seems prudent to consider initial conditions on @xmath0 such that @xmath102 in the early universe .      in",
    "has long been known that the tracker solution in ipl models ( by which we mean the solution given by equation ( [ eq : q(t ) ] ) when @xmath5 is small or what this solution becomes when @xmath5 is large ) is an attractor but that under certain initial conditions the time required to reach the tracker solution will be longer than the present age of the universe @xcite .",
    "several authors have derived limits on @xmath11 based on the argument that the tracker must be reached at some point before the present epoch .",
    "for example : steinhardt , wang & zlatev @xcite bounded @xmath103 by demanding that the field reaches its tracker solution by matter - radiation equality when initially the energy density of the universe at the inflationary scale was equipartitioned between the quintessence and the remaining fluid components .",
    "similarly , frieman and waga @xcite obtained the bound @xmath104 using sn ia data for currently acceptable values of the matter density , @xmath105 .",
    "we shall not impose these restrictions and consider in this section all solutions that are able to satisfy the boundary condition whether they reach the tracker by the present epoch or not .",
    "since we shall frequently compare a solution calculated from arbitrary initial conditions to the tracker we will denote any quantity associated with the latter by the subscript @xmath106 .",
    "we introduce the quantity @xmath107 , as in @xcite , defined to be the ratio of the solution @xmath108 given arbitrary initial conditions to the tracker solution @xmath109 for some fixed value of the ipl exponent @xmath11 i.e. @xmath110 with this definition of @xmath111 a solution reaches the tracker solution when @xmath112 . when @xmath113 we can derive an equation of motion @xcite from equation ( [ eq : equation of motion ] ) after using equation ( [ eq : q(t ) ] ) @xmath114\\,t\\,\\dot{u } \\label{eq : u equation of motion } \\\\ & & -   \\frac{2}{\\gamma+2}\\,\\left [ \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma+2 } - \\frac{2}{w_{f}+1 } \\right]\\ ,   \\left ( u - \\frac{1}{u^{\\gamma+1 } } \\right ) = 0 .",

    "the oscillations around @xmath119 seen in liddle & scherrer @xcite are too small to be seen with the scale of the figure because they occur when @xmath120 .",

    "in contrast , when @xmath126 the initial value of @xmath107 is smaller than unity .",
    "as we integrate the equations we see a very rapid and immediate increase as @xmath107 rushes up to a peak value after which @xmath107 turns over and again falls as a power law .",
    "for the two cases here the solution joins the tracker at @xmath127 for @xmath128 , @xmath129 for @xmath130 . from these four cases it is apparent that a value of @xmath80 in relative proximity to the tracker solution @xmath118 joins the tracker very quickly but as @xmath80 strays from @xmath118 the time required to reach the tracker grows rapidly .",

    "this figure helps explain the results in figure ( [ fig : u a ] ) .",
    "every case is initially set at @xmath53 and for @xmath121 the equation of state remains at this value until the tracker is joined at @xmath122 and @xmath124 seen previously .",
    "note that in this figure the oscillations of the field around the tracker are seen as the small wiggles in @xmath8 immediately prior to the joining of the tracker solution .",
    "during this phase of @xmath53 the field behaves as a cosmological constant .",
    "the figure indicates that the larger the discrepancy between @xmath80 and @xmath118 for @xmath121 the longer this pseudo - cosmological constant phase and eventually we would expect that at some sufficiently small @xmath80 the solution never joins the tracker .",
    "however , such a small value of @xmath80 circumvents the main appeal of quintessence and we will not pursue this possibility further . in contrast , for those cases where @xmath132 the equation of state jumps from @xmath53 to @xmath54 very rapidly and remains there for some time before promptly plummeting to @xmath53 .",
    "this period of kinetic energy domination is much longer than the rise and turnover seen in figure ( [ fig : u a ] ) and its duration grows as the difference between @xmath80 and @xmath118 increases . once again , during the phase of @xmath53 the field behaves as a cosmological constant and from there the solution joins the tracker in the same fashion as the two cases where @xmath133 .",

    "thus we are led to conclude that @xmath0 is essentially stationary even though the field may be dominated by its kinetic energy .",
    "such behavior is expected since nothing in the derivation of equation ( [ eq : u(t ) ] ) depended upon @xmath8 , the only requirement was that @xmath136 . however , in these cases the initial value of @xmath107 is much smaller than unity so strictly equation ( [ eq : u(t ) ] ) does not apply exactly at @xmath76 and @xmath142 and @xmath143 are therefore not given by equations ( [ eq : u plus ] ) and ( [ eq : u minus ] ) . but this limit is reached very quickly and , furthermore , the peak value of @xmath107 is approximately the same as @xmath142 , the normalization of the late time evolution . by locating the time @xmath149 where the derivative of @xmath107 vanishes",

    "= 3.3 in    before proceeding to further investigate the implications of the non - tracker solutions we temporarily digress to examine the importance of the initial scale factor upon our results .",
    "so far we have begun all our integrations of @xmath35 and @xmath8 from an initial scale factor of @xmath79 .",
    "we already know the tracker value of @xmath35 increases with the scale factor from equation ( [ eq : tracker alpha ] ) and as we showed in figures ( [ fig : u a ] ) and ( [ fig : w a ] ) the closer the value of @xmath80 to @xmath118 the shorter the non - tracker phase . from these considerations",
    "it is therefore natural to expect solutions with an arbitrary value of @xmath80 to reach the tracker more rapidly as @xmath78 increases .",
    "figure ( [ fig : u vs a , vary ai ] ) , a plot of @xmath107 versus @xmath24 when @xmath130 and for different @xmath78 , shows that this is exactly the case . as @xmath78 increases the duration of the non - tracker phase and the height of the peak value of @xmath107 decrease .",
    "but the figure also shows that the scale factor at which a solution reaches the tracker is independent of @xmath78 .",
    "this is not totally unexpected : our estimate of @xmath161 does nt change with @xmath78 if we use the same value of @xmath80 so the change in @xmath162 as @xmath78 increases simply reflects the evolution of the tracker solution . from this result",
    "we see that the evolution of the field as we approach the current epoch is robust and the necessity of specifying the initial scale factor for non - tracker solutions has disappeared .    when @xmath115 the two cases @xmath163 and @xmath164 are sufficiently close to @xmath118 that the tracker is reached during the radiation dominated era , while the @xmath165 curve reaches the tracker at the beginning of the transition to the matter dominated era .",
    "the @xmath166 curve does not reach the tracker at all , and were it not for the initial climb to @xmath167 , this case would be identical to a cosmological constant .",
    "this is consistent with our expectations if @xmath160 were approximately the same as the present value of @xmath119 . from malquarti & liddle @xcite @xmath168 ( in reduced plank mass units ) for @xmath115",

    "this figure clearly shows the change at @xmath173 where the equation of state of @xmath0 drops to @xmath174 as @xmath80 passes through the equipartition value . there is a slight movement of the transition point with @xmath11 but it is not large .",
    "= 3.3 in    in figure ( [ fig : wcontourplot ] ) we summarize our discussion of non - tracker quintessence with a contour plot of the final value of @xmath8 as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath80 . for values of @xmath175 ,",
    "the final value of @xmath8 is only a function of @xmath11 while for @xmath176 we have the situation where the equation of state at the present time is close to @xmath177 for a large range in @xmath11 .",
    "the slight dip in the contours of @xmath178 are a result of @xmath0 just reaching the tracker at the present epoch . just before @xmath0 ` hooks '",
    "the tracker it oscillates around that solution @xcite and these oscillations are seen as dips in the contours .",
    "the figure shows essentially a dichotomy of acceptable solutions in the ipl model . in order to obtain an equation of state within the current observationally favored limits @xmath9 we are forced to small values of @xmath11 if @xmath175 _ but _ if the initial conditions are such that the quintessence energy density is comparable to , or larger than , the radiation component virtually any value of @xmath11 is permitted .",
    "a universe initially dominated by a quintessence field evolves to one that effectively possesses a cosmological constant , independent of the value of @xmath11 .",
    "we have already derived an upper limit to @xmath11 just from the requirement that the universe accelerate .",
    "we can improve upon this result by using observations of the cmb and sn ia , which provide powerful probes of cosmology from a redshift of @xmath179 and lower .",
    "the significant changes introduced into the cmb angular power spectrum by replacing a vacuum energy with an ipl quintessence field have been discussed by many authors including ratra & peebles @xcite and kneller & steigman @xcite .",
    "the position of the peaks in the angular power spectrum are proportional to the ratio of the sound horizon at recombination to the angular diameter distance at that redshift , while the height of the peaks is set by their variance relative to the variance at the largest angular scales as measured by cobe . for a given redshift and matter density ,",
    "quintessence increases the dark energy density , leading to a swifter expansion rate . for the ipl tracker solution ,",
    "the contribution from @xmath6 is small until the recent epoch , thus its influence only becomes significant at low redshifts .",
    "the swifter expansion results in a reduction of the angular diameter distance , @xmath180 while leaving the sound horizon at recombination unaltered .",
    "an increase in @xmath181 therefore moves the peak positions to larger angular scales and they become more tightly bunched .",
    "this effect increases with @xmath11 because for tracker solutions the energy density is correlated with the exponent : smaller @xmath11 corresponding to smaller @xmath6 at any fixed redshift . at the same time models with quintessence",
    "always pass through the matter - dark energy transition at a higher redshift even if they typically begin to accelerate at a lower redshift .",
    "the earlier dominance of the dark energy will result in a more significant decay of the gravitational potentials so that any photon traversing a potential well will emerge with a larger blueshift relative to the background expansion .",
    "the increased blueshifting ( and the increased redshifting from potential hills ) leads to an enhancement in the variance of the cmb temperature .",
    "this integrated sachs wolfe ( isw ) effect is most effective at scales above the causal horizon at the time of the matter - dark energy transition i.e. the largest angular scales .",
    "but the cobe normalization of the cmb power spectrum is exactly at these scales",
    "so the net result is that it is the variance at the smallest scales that is reduced . once again , this effect increases with @xmath11 for exactly the same reason .",
    "the recent evidence for the current acceleration of the universe comes from the use of sn ia as ` standard candles ' at high - redshifts , @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "sn ia are good standard candles because of the strong correlation between the peak in the absolute magnitude and the decline in brightness 15 days after the peak @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the apparent magnitude is all that is needed to determine the luminosity distance @xmath183 .",
    "this same quantity can be computed for a given cosmology through @xmath184 from this equation it is immediately obvious that an increase in the hubble parameter results in a smaller luminosity distance and hence a brighter sn ia for a given redshift . for tracker solutions , as @xmath11 increases the luminosity distance decreases and so the same sn ia will appear brighter still .",
    "= 3.3 in    in figure ( [ fig : chis_tracker ] ) we compare the ipl model predictions using tracker initial conditions with the cmb and sn ia data by plotting @xmath185 , the @xmath186 per degree of freedom @xmath187 as a function of @xmath11 . for the cmb data we use the 41 points of boomerang @xcite , dasi @xcite and maxima @xcite together with radpack @xcite to calculate the @xmath186 .",
    "we optimize over the scalar tilt and the baryon - to - photon ratio but , in order to make the calculation computationally feasible , we have not marginalized over the present hubble parameter or the matter density @xmath43 . for sn ia",
    ", we use the 54 data points from ` fit c ' of @xcite . for the cmb data",
    "the 99% goodness - of - fit limit is @xmath188 while the equivalent limit when using the sn ia data is @xmath189 .",
    "the figure clearly shows that smaller values of @xmath11 are favored and we can extract an upper limit to @xmath11 of @xmath190 at 99% from the sn ia data , @xmath191 at 99% from the cmb data .",
    "this limit is a somewhat stringent because we have not marginalized over all the remaining parameters but the result is not very much different from other studies of ipl quintessence such as malquarti & liddle @xcite who derived @xmath192 at 99% .",
    "figure ( [ fig : chis_tracker ] ) clearly demonstrates that if we use tracker initial conditions then the field must be very similar to the cosmological constant .",
    "although we make this statement after considering only the ipl model this result is in qualitative agreement with other analysis of quintessence using the cmb and sn ia which used a constant equation of state @xmath8 @xcite .      as we have seen from figure ( [ fig : wcontourplot ] ) , @xmath193 widens the allowed parameter space in @xmath11 when fitting @xmath8 to present observed bounds .",
    "larger values of @xmath80 behave more like a cosmological constant , @xmath53 , except for the caveat of an initial period when @xmath54 . thus , since larger values of @xmath80 push the current value of @xmath194 , we might expect that these solutions would provide a very good fit to the cmb and sn ia data .",
    "= 3.3 in    in figure ( [ fig : snandcmbcontours ] ) we plot the contours of constant @xmath195 and @xmath196 , that correspond to 95% and 99% goodness - of - fit to the sn ia , and @xmath197 and @xmath198 , the 95% and 99% goodness - of - fit to the cmb data , again in the @xmath199 plane .",
    "for @xmath175 the exponent @xmath11 is very tightly bound by the cmb and sn ia because in this region the field joined the tracker solution before the present epoch .",
    "the limits on @xmath11 are exactly the same as found for tracker initial conditions derived from figure ( [ fig : chis_tracker ] ) .",
    "but when @xmath176 the field has not joined the tracker and we find the range of acceptable values of @xmath11 increases significantly such that much of the region @xmath200 is compatible with sn ia and cmb constraints .",
    "thus the frequently stated limits on the exponent of power - law potential only apply when the initial value of @xmath80 falls within the range that will converge to the tracker solution by the present day for a given value of @xmath11 .",
    "we have examined the ipl quintessence model focusing on the influence of the initial conditions upon the behavior of the solutions and in particular those cases where the field has not converged to the tracker solution by the present day .",
    "we have re - analyzed the previously derived bounds on the exponent @xmath11 in the potential and find initial conditions that lead to solutions where the field reached the tracker before the present day limits the exponent to @xmath201 . however , after we looked at initial conditions where the field does not reach the tracker we found much larger values of @xmath11 are permissible .",
    "the dividing line between the two types of solution occurs at the point of equipartition between the initial quintessence and radiation energy densities and this is independent of the initial scale factor .",
    "ipl models of quintessence give rise to values of the equations of state at the present time that are close to @xmath177 either by the exponent being small , @xmath201 , with small initial energy densities relative to the radiation _ or _ very large initial energy densities relative to the radiation content and arbitrary exponents .",
