    "it was argued long ago that melting of quarkonia above the deconfinement transition can serve as a signature of quark - gluon plasma formation in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind this proposal was that due to color screening the potential between a quark and anti - quark will not provide sufficient binding at high temperature .",
    "this problem can be formulated more rigorously in terms of quarkonium spectral functions , which can be , in principle , extracted from euclidean - time meson correlation functions calculated on the lattice .",
    "attempts doing this based on the maximum entropy method ( mem ) have been discussed over the last few years .",
    "the initial interpretation of data led to the conclusion that the @xmath0 charmonium states survive in the deconfined medium up to temperatures of about @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the transition temperature @xcite .",

    "calculations have been done in pure gluodynamics , 3-flavor and 2-flavor qcd @xcite , and preliminary results are also available in the physically relevant case of one heavy strange quark and two light quarks @xcite ( the light quark masses correspond to pion mass of about @xmath3  mev ) .",
    "recently attempts to calculate quarkonium properties at finite temperature using resummed perturbation theory have been made @xcite .",
    "resummed perturbation theory appears to be successful in calculations of bulk thermodynamics properties @xcite .",
    "since the lattice calculations of spectral functions have severe limitations , in @xcite it has been pointed out , that comparison between the lattice data and potential models should be done in terms of the euclidean time correlators , for which the numerical results are much more reliable .",

    "in this contribution we discuss the calculation of quarkonium spectral functions in a potential model , which uses the lattice data of the free energy of a static quark anti - quark pair .",

    "it is therefore possible that the bump of the spectral functions calculated from lattice correlators using mem actually corresponds to a threshold enhancement , and was mistakenly interpreted as the @xmath0 state . in the case of bottomonium all states , except the @xmath0 state , are dissolved above the deconfinement transition .",

    "the binding energy is defined as the distance between the continuum threshold @xmath28 and the bound state peak . due to the small binding energy",
    "the 1s state will acquire a sizable thermal width , and may not show up as the resonance in the corresponding spectral function .",
