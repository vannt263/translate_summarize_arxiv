    "nowadays , due to the great development of acquisition and reproduction systems , audio visual content is ubiquitous .",
    "unfortunately , processing , coding and transmission algorithms generate various degradations . + considering these limitations , the assessment of the visual impact of these distortions on images is required . to meet this growing demand ,",
    "psycho - visual experiments can be performed .",
    "various subjective evaluation processes have been designed in order to quantify the image quality using a panel of human observers .",
    "however , they are time consuming and difficult to implement .",
    "therefore , objective quality evaluation has been proposed as an alternative solution .",
    "its main goal is to assess the quality of a distorted image using an automatically computed measure , well correlated with human visual judgment .",
    "we can identify three main types of objective measures .",
    "full reference ( fr ) measures which , use the entire original image , as a reference , to estimate the quality of its distorted version . generally , no information related to the type of distortion is needed .",
    "no reference ( nr ) measures require only the degraded image . however , the type of distortion is generally assumed to be known .",
    "they are considered the most attractive from a practical point of view as no side information is needed to grade an image .",
    "reduced reference ( rr ) measures have been developed to overcome the drawback related to fr and nr measures .",
    "this rr measurement can be predicted by only some limited features extracted from both images .",
    "furthermore , no a priori information , about the distortion type , is required .",
    "+ recently , a number of authors have successfully introduced rr methods based on : image distortion modeling  @xcite , human visual system ( hvs ) modeling  @xcite , and finally natural scene statistics ( nss ) modeling  @xcite .",
    "our work fits in this latter approach .",
    "indeed , natural images statistics are the basic stimuli that our visual system is adapted to . understanding the way by which statistics change and measuring these changes allows us to predict the visual degradation .",
    "the first measure based on nss has been introduced by wang et al  @xcite .",
    "known as wnism , this method is based on the distribution of the steerable pyramid coefficients computed from the images . in order to minimize the side information to be transmitted , a generalized gaussian distribution model is assumed .",
    "indeed , under this assumption , only the estimated parameters of the distribution are transmitted , instead of the full histogram . at the receiver",
    "side the kullback - leibler divergence is computed in order to quantify the distortion .",
    "this pioneering work has been improved by li et al  @xcite .",
    "they introduce a divisive normalization transform which consists on using the same transformation cited above followed by a gaussianization process of non - gaussian assumed coefficients distribution .",
    "the so - called dnt method has gained in efficiency in terms of correlation with the visual human perceived quality .",
    "however , it is much more time consuming , because of the normalization process .",
    "+ to overcome this drawback , we proposed in a our previous work , a quality measure called emism @xcite .",
    "it uses the empirical mode decomposition transform instead of the steerable pyramid .",
    "the generalized gaussian distribution model distribution is assumed and the distortion measure is computed in the same way than for the previous methods , i.e. the kullback - leibler divergence . an alternative approach has been proposed by soundararajan et al  @xcite .",
    "the so - called rred method is based on the entropy difference between the wavelet coefficients .",
    "+ all these methods operate on gray level images .",
    "while the great majority of images are captured in color , their visual quality is therefore estimated ignoring the color information . according to our knowledge",
    ", there is no a real rr measure based on nss that has been proposed for color image quality assessment . in an earlier work  @xcite ,",
    "we have attempted to extend the approach based on the marginal distributions to color images .",
    "results were quite promising and motivating enough to study the effect of color on rr measures . in this paper , we aim to study how color representation can influence the quality assessment process for rr statistical based methods . to meet this objective , first , we choose four rr methods based on nss in grayscale level , which are wnism , dnt , rred and emism .",
    "then , we compare their performances in terms of quality assessment to their natural extension to color .",
    "we recall that this is a trivial extension by combining the values obtained from the three components by summation .",
    "in this study , we consider two influential color spaces , namely rgb and cielab .",
    "we choose rgb for its simplicity and suitability to a lot of methods and cielab because it is close to human visual perception .",
    "to compare these methods , the tid 2013 benchmark is used , due to the abundance of the distortion types it contains .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to give a clear view of the impact of the color information on natural image statistics quality based approaches .",
    "our goal is not to design an optimized quality metric for color images but to pave the way for further improvement .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec:1 ] presents the selected method and how we extend these methods for color images .",
    "section  [ sec:2 ] concerns the experimental data and the validation protocol .",
    "section  [ sec:3 ] details the experimental results and finally concluding remarks are presented in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] illustrates the general scheme of nss based quality assessment methods .",
    "we distinguish two channels .",
    "the sender side is linked to the original image while the receiver side is linked to the distorted image . on each channel , a transform is performed to get @xmath0 subbands . assuming a model @xmath1 for the subbands coefficients distribution , the parameter sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 are estimated from the empirical distributions .",
    "note that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the set of parameters vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 for each subband of the reference image and the degraded image and @xmath6 is the subband index . at the sender side @xmath2 is transmitted . at the receiver",
    "side a distortion measure @xmath7 is computed between the original and degraded image subbands distributions .",
    "note that different dissimilarity measures can be used to quantify the differences between the subbands distributions .",
    "finally a non - linear regression using a logistic function is performed in order to compute the predicted mos .",
    "more details are found in the experiments setup section .",
    "wnism uses the steerable pyramid transform  @xcite to get an efficient and accurate linear decomposition of an image into scale and orientation subbands . the generalized gaussian density ( ggd ) used for subbands modeling",
    "is defined as follows : @xmath8 \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represents the scale and the shape parameters respectively that need to be estimated for each subband .",
    "the statistical framework to estimate these parameters is the maximum likelihood , which can be computed efficiently .",
    "+ the overall distortion measure @xmath7 is based on the sum of the kullback - leibler divergence ( kld ) of the @xmath0 subbands  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a constant used to control the scale of the distortion measure and the kld for the subband @xmath13 is represented by @xmath14 .",
    "+ note that there exist a closed - form expression for the kld between two ggd where only the model parameters are involved .",
    "motivated by perceptual and statistical issues , lee et al  @xcite proposed to substitute to the wavelet representation a divisive normalization transform ( dnt ) .",
    "it is built upon a wavelet image decomposition , followed by a divisive normalization stage .",
    "this process produces approximately gaussian marginal distributions .",
    "li et al propose an initial model based on the gaussian scale mixture ( gsm ) for the wavelet coefficients  @xcite .",
    "it can be expressed as the product of two independent components : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes equality in probability distribution , @xmath17 is a zero - mean gaussian random vector with covariance @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a scalar random variable called a mixing multiplier . in other words , the gsm model expresses the density of a random vector as a mixture of gaussians with the same covariance structure @xmath18 but scaled differently ( by @xmath19 ) .",
    "suppose that the mixing density is @xmath20 , then the density of @xmath21 can be written as : @xmath22^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\left|z^{2}m\\right|^{\\frac{1}{2}}}exp-\\left(\\frac{x^{t}m^{-1}x}{2z^{2}}\\right)p_{z}(z)dz \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] the dnt coefficients are computed based on the maximum - likelihood estimate of @xmath19 .",
    "after normalization , the dnt marginal statistics can be efficiently modeled by a zero - mean gaussian distribution .",
    "consequently , the dissimilarity measure between two normalized subband distributions is approximated by the kld between two gaussian distributions .",
    "in addition , authors propose to add distances based on the difference between the standard deviation , the kurtosis , and the skewness of the dnt coefficients computed from the original and distorted images , respectively .",
    "finally , the overall image distortion measure is represented here as a weighted linear combination of the four distances .",
    "this procedure is applied to a single subband , so it is necessary to calculate the sum of all sub - bands to find the overall measure @xmath7 .      in  @xcite",
    ", we proposed a distortion measure called emism that uses the empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) as a transformation domain .",
    "the emd is based on the frequency - time analysis and decomposes each image into a number of intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) and a residue .",
    "the basis functions of the emd derived from the image content allow an adaptive analysis that is more suited to model the visual information .",
    "indeed , in the steerable pyramid representation , the basis functions are fixed and do not necessarily match the varying nature of images .",
    "experimental results have demonstrated that the ggd is a good fit for the imf distribution .",
    "based on this model , the distortion measure is computed as in wnism , i.e. the kld between the imf statistics .      the principal idea underlying rred as proposed by soundararajan et al  @xcite is to link the distortion to the entropy difference between the wavelet coefficients .",
    "the rred algorithm split the subband in blocks , and then computes the entropy of each block , assuming a gsm model .",
    "then the difference between the entropy of the reference and distorted image is calculated . in this case",
    ", @xmath23 is a set of entropies obtained for the blocks .",
    "the overall distance @xmath7 is the summation of the difference of the entropies between the original and degraded blocks . in other case ,",
    "the distance is the difference between the summation of the entropies of the two chosen subbands .      as our goal is to investigate the impact of color information rather than optimizing the metrics",
    ", we consider a simple adaptation to color images .",
    "it is based on the summation of the distortion measures obtained independently from the three - color components .",
    "we choose to investigate two color spaces .",
    "the rgb color space because it is the most influential additive color space  @xcite , and cielab ( or l*a*b * or lab ) which is a color - opponent space  @xcite .",
    "while rgb gives individual values for red , green and blue , l stand for lightness and a and b for the color - opponent dimensions .",
    "cielab has been designed in order to be a perceptually uniform color space . in other word ,",
    "a change of the same amount in a color value should produce a change of about the same visual importance .",
