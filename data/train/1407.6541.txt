    "charm and beauty quarks are effective probes of the properties of the hot and dense strongly - interacting medium formed in high - energy nuclear collision , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "they are sensitive to the transport properties of the medium , since they are predominantly produced on a short time scale in primary partonic scattering processes with large virtuality @xmath0 . due to their large masses ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and the minimum virtuality , @xmath3 , required for the production of a @xmath4 pair , the temporal and spatial scales , @xmath5 , are sufficiently small for the production to be unaffected by the qgp medium .    for hard processes , in the absence of nuclear and medium effects , a nucleus  nucleus ( a  a ) or a proton  nucleus ( p  a ) collision would behave as a superposition of independent nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) collisions . the charm and beauty differential yields @xmath6 would scale from pp to a  a or p  a proportionally to the number @xmath7 of inelastic nn collisions ( binary scaling ) .",
    "the binary scaling is `` broken '' by initial - state and final - state effects . in the initial state ,",
    "the nuclear environment affects the quark and gluon distributions , which are modified in bound nucleons depending on the parton fractional momentum @xmath8 and the atomic mass number a @xcite .",
    "partons can also lose energy in the initial stages of the collision via initial state radiation @xcite or experience transverse momentum broadening due to multiple soft collisions before the @xmath9 pair is produced @xcite .",
    "the final - state effects are related to the heavy - quark interaction with the medium .",
    "the most relevant effect is partonic energy loss due to medium - induced gluon radiation ( inelastic processes ) @xcite and collisions with medium constituents ( elastic processes ) @xcite .",
    "the modification of binary scaling is quantified via the nuclear modification factor , defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the average nuclear overlap function calculated with the glauber model in the considered centrality range .",
    "quarks are predicted to lose less energy than gluons due to their smaller colour coupling factor . in addition , the dead - cone effect is expected to reduce small - angle gluon radiation , thus the energy loss , for heavy quarks with respect to light quarks @xcite .",
    "this effect can be tested by comparing the @xmath12 suppression of the mostly gluon - originated light - flavour hadrons and that of d and b mesons .",
    "however , the comparison of heavy - flavour hadron and pion @xmath13 can not be interpreted directly as a comparison of charm , beauty and gluon energy losses due to the different fragmentation functions and slope of the @xmath14-differential cross sections @xcite .",

    "the data were collected using minimum bias and emcal triggers .",
    "muon tracks were reconstructed in minimum bias trigger events in the forward muon spectrometer ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "d mesons were reconstructed at mid - rapidity ( @xmath17 ) in minimum bias pb  pb collisions via their hadronic decay channels : @xmath18 ( with branching ratio , br , of @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 ( br of @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 ( br of @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 ( br of @xmath25 ) @xcite and their charge conjugates .",
    "d - meson selection was based on the reconstruction of decay vertices displaced by a few hundred @xmath26 m from the interaction vertex , exploiting the the high track spatial resolution close to the interaction vertex of the collision , granted by the inner tracking system detector ( its ) .",
    "charged pions and kaons were identified using tpc and tof signals .",
