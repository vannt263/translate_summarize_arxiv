    "the first painlev equation ( @xmath0 ) is usually written in the canonical form [ p1orig ] = 6u^2 + z. it is known that all solutions of ( [ p1orig ] ) are non - classical transcendental functions , in the sense that they can not be written in terms of algebraic or elliptic functions of @xmath1 , nor in terms of classical special functions defined by linear differential equations .",
    "the @xmath0 equation was discovered in painlev s classification of second order differential equations whose solutions have the property that all movable singularities are poles . for the equation ( [ p1orig ] ) , it is further known that all solutions of this equation are meromorphic , with an infinite number of poles in the complex plane .",
    "although painlev s original approach to proving meromorphicity , as outlined in chapter xiv of ince s book @xcite , appears to have some gaps from the modern point of view , these issues have subsequently been resolved ( see @xcite ) , and other rigorous proofs are also available , either indirectly by reformulating an associated isomonodromy problem as a regular riemann - hilbert problem @xcite , or more directly using differential inequalities @xcite .",
    "the papers in this special issue are written in honour of okamoto s insights concerning the space of initial values for the painlev equations .",
    "the important point made by okamoto is that , in order to consider the solutions of a system with poles , such as ( [ p1orig ] ) , one should enlarge the phase space : as well as regular initial conditions @xmath2 , it is necessary to consider the case where @xmath3 ( hence also @xmath4 ) has a pole at @xmath5 ; this requires adding points at infinity to the phase space , and leads to a sequence of blowups around singular points @xcite .",
    "boutroux showed that , for large @xmath6 , with the scaled variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the solution of ( [ p1orig ] ) behaves asymptotically like an elliptic function , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the weierstrass function and @xmath11 .",
    "] , which satisfies the second order differential equation [ wp ]  = 6 ^ 2 -g_2 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present some remarks about the direct comparison between the solutions of the @xmath0 equation and the weierstrass elliptic functions , at the level of exact series expansions rather than asymptotics .    after introducing our conventions of scaling and notation in the next section , in section 3",
    "we proceed to compare the coefficients in the laurent series for the @xmath10 function , which are written in terms of modular forms , with the corresponding expansion of solutions of ( [ p1orig ] ) around a pole .",
    "this produces a natural analogy between the lemniscatic and equianharmonic elliptic functions , which have the symmetries of the square and the hexagon , respectively , and a special solution of @xmath0 which is singular at the origin and has pentagonal symmetry . in section 4",
    "we apply the same idea to the tau - function of @xmath0 , and show how both the hirota bilinear form , and an associated equation of degree four , lead to recursive formulae for the taylor coefficients in the expansion around a zero .",
    "this both generalizes the results of eilbeck and enolskii on the weierstrass sigma function @xcite , and at the same time extends some classical expansion formulae due to weierstrass @xcite to the case of @xmath0 .",
    "as well as being of theoretical interest , we show that these formulae are also useful for doing numerical computations .",
    "the programme of classification initiated by painlev began by considering the necessary conditions for an equation such as ( [ p1orig ] ) to have only poles as movable singularities .",
    "this requires some local analysis to identify the form that algebraic singularities can take at leading order , followed by a power series expansion around any such singularity to check whether any secular terms can appear ; nowadays this procedure is often referred to as painlev analysis ( see @xcite and references ) . for the equation ( [ p1orig ] )",
    "the only algebraic singularities are double poles , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ( movable ) position of the pole .",
    "this leading order behaviour then extends to a power series , whose resonances ( the places where arbitrary coefficients can appear in the expansion ) are found by substituting @xmath14 into the equation and comparing the leading order terms that are linear in @xmath15 . in this case one finds a quadratic equation in @xmath16 , with roots @xmath17 ; the root @xmath18 corresponds to the fact that the position of the pole at @xmath13 is movable , while the value @xmath19 means that the coefficient of @xmath20 in the expansion should be arbitrary .",
    "finally , one must calculate the terms of a full laurent expansion around the pole up to order @xmath20 , and check that no additional counterterms involving @xmath21 are needed for consistency .",
    "hence one obtains a local series representation of the general solution , with two free constants corresponding to the resonances .",
    "assuming that such a laurent expansion is convergent in some neighbourhood of @xmath13 , this verifies that ( [ p1orig ] ) has solutions that are locally meromorphic around a pole .",
    "then for @xmath0 , any local laurent expansion around a pole completely fixes a global solution of the equation , by analytic continuation .",
    "however , purely local analysis is not sufficient to establish that all solutions are meromorphic in @xmath22 , since global estimates are necessary to ensure that poles can not coalesce to form an essential singularity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    for what follows ,",
    "it is worth mentioning at this stage that the details of the painlev analysis for the differential equation ( [ wp ] ) are almost identical to those for @xmath0 .",
    "however , if one replaces the @xmath1 in ( [ p1orig ] ) , or the constant @xmath23 in ( [ wp ] ) , by an arbitrary holomorphic function @xmath24 , then at the resonance @xmath19 one requires @xmath25 for all @xmath13 , and hence @xmath26 must be a linear function , in order to have a consistent laurent series .    in the rest of the paper we consider solutions of ( [ p1orig ] ) with a pole at @xmath13 ,",
    "so it is convenient to replace @xmath27 , which adds a constant to the right hand side of ( [ p1orig ] ) .",
    "furthermore , for comparison with the equation ( [ wp ] ) it is useful to rescale @xmath28 and @xmath29 , so that we arrive at the following equation : [ pi ] = 6u^2 - 6z- .",
    "the above equation has two parameters , namely @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and any solution of the @xmath0 equation in the canonical form ( [ p1orig ] ) with a double pole at @xmath5 corresponds to a solution of ( [ pi ] ) with a pole at @xmath32 , for a suitable choice of the constant @xmath31 , with any @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath34 the equation ( [ pi ] ) reduces to ( [ wp ] ) .      to determine the local laurent expansion of the solution of ( [ pi ] ) with a double pole at the origin , we insert the expression @xmath35 into the equation , from which subsequent coefficients are determined by the recursion [ orec ] ( n+1)(n-6 ) c_n = 6 _ j=1^n-1 c_j c_n - j -g_2_n,4 - 6_n,5 , n1 .",
    "the above relation determines all the coefficients @xmath36 uniquely , but @xmath37 is arbitrary ( corresponding to the aforementioned resonance ) .",
    "once @xmath37 has been fixed , then all @xmath38 for @xmath39 are all uniquely determined by ( [ orec ] ) .",
    "we find [ inits ] c_1=c_2=c_3=0 , c_4= , c_5= , c_6= , c_7 = 0 , ",
    ", where the value of @xmath37 is given in terms of an additional parameter @xmath40 , which is introduced for ease of comparison with the elliptic case .",
    "the following result is immediate .",
    "for @xmath41 the coefficients of the expansion ( [ series ] ) , with @xmath42 , are polynomials in @xmath31 , @xmath30 and @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath43 , where @xmath44 has rational coefficients and is weighted homogeneous of total degree @xmath45 in these arguments with weights @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively : @xmath48    the polynomials @xmath44 for @xmath49 can be read off from ( [ inits ] ) .",
    "note that , a priori , they must be identically zero for @xmath50 , since there are no non - zero homogeneous polynomials with these weights ; but they are non - zero for all other values of @xmath45 . here",
    "we list the next few non - trivial ones : @xmath51 @xmath52 these polynomials have some interesting properties .",
    "as will be explained in section 3 , for @xmath34 the polynomials @xmath53 are polynomials in @xmath31 and @xmath40 , which define modular forms : up to overall scaling they give the eisenstein series of the elliptic curve [ curve ] y^2=4x^3-g_2 x - g_3 .",
    "in fact , viewing each @xmath44 as a polynomial in @xmath30 with coefficients in @xmath54 $ ] , each coefficient is weighted homogeneous in @xmath55 with some weight , so also defines a modular form .",
    "thus we refer to the @xmath44 as _ modular polynomials_.    henceforth we let @xmath56 denote the meromorphic function defined by the series ( [ series ] ) .",
    "our main task in section 3 will be to consider the asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients @xmath38 in this series as @xmath57 , and the way that this depends on the parameters @xmath58 . before doing this",
    ", we introduce some objects needed in section 4 .      hamiltonian forms of the painlev equations were originally found by malmquist @xcite .",
    "some years later , okamoto introduced the notion of a tau - function associated with the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ pi ] ) can be written as a hamiltonian system like so : [ ham ] u = , v=- , h = v^2 - 2u^3+g_2 u + 6z u + g_3 . (",
    "the constant @xmath40 is included in the hamiltonian @xmath59 for later convenience . )",
    "taking the total derivative of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath1 we have [ hp ] h = = 6u .",
    "the tau - function associated with a solution of ( [ pi ] ) is a function @xmath60 such that [ tau ] u = - . observe that the preceding relation only defines @xmath61 up to gauge transformations [ gauge ] ( a z + b ) , a , b , and the fact that @xmath3 is meromorphic means that @xmath61 is holomorphic , with @xmath61 having simple zeros wherever @xmath3 has double poles .",
    "we also note from ( [ hp ] ) that , up to the addition of a constant , we have [ htau ] h=-6 . the constant of integration has been fixed so that when @xmath34 we have @xmath62 , and the right hand side of ( [ ham ] ) corresponds to the first order differential equation for the weierstrass @xmath10 function , i.e. [ wpeq ] ( )^2 = 4 ^ 3 -g_2-g_3 , for @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this choice of integration constant will also be convenient for the analysis of the tau - function when @xmath65 .",
    "we now describe the behaviour of the coefficients @xmath38 , which satisfy the recursion @xmath66 for a suitable choice of initial values . to begin with",
    "we consider the classical case @xmath67 , with @xmath68 , for which @xmath69 in ( [ rec1 ] ) .      the weierstrass @xmath10 function can be defined as the unique solution of the first order differential equation ( [ wpeq ] ) having a double pole at @xmath32 .",
    "however , in most standard treatments of elliptic function theory ( see e.g. chapter xx in @xcite ) , it is usually defined by its mittag - leffler expansion , that is [ ml ] ( z ; g_2,g_3 ) = + _ \\ { 0 } ( - ) , where @xmath70 denotes the period lattice , consisting of all periods of the form @xmath71 for @xmath72 , generated by the two independent periods @xmath73 , @xmath74",
    ". the uniform convergence of the expansion ( [ ml ] ) is guaranteed by the fact that the power sums @xmath75 are absolutely convergent for all @xmath76 , and expanding around @xmath32 gives the series ( [ series ] ) with @xmath77 , @xmath78 and [ cexp ] c_n=(n-1 ) _ 0 ^-n , n3 .",
    "thus it follows from ( [ ml ] ) that @xmath10 satisfies the differential equation ( [ wpeq ] ) with @xmath79 conversely , given a solution of ( [ wpeq ] ) with parameters @xmath55 , two independent periods are obtained from the integrals @xmath80 , @xmath81 around cycles @xmath82 that generate the homology of the elliptic curve ( [ curve ] ) .",
    "( this is in the generic case @xmath83 ; otherwise ( [ wpeq ] ) is solved in elementary functions . )    observe that , from the symmetry of the lattice @xmath84 , where the poles of @xmath85 are situated , the odd index coefficients @xmath86 for all @xmath41 ( hence @xmath10 is an even function )",
    ". the even index sums ( [ cexp ] ) can be rewritten as [ cform ] c_2n= g_2n ( ) , where the function @xmath87 is the eisenstein series , a modular form of weight @xmath88 corresponding to a normalized lattice with periods @xmath89 , with @xmath90 : @xmath91    the periods @xmath92 , @xmath93 can always be ordered so that im@xmath94 , and by choosing @xmath95 to be minimal we also have @xmath96 .",
    "then the series ( [ series ] ) has radius of convergence @xmath95 , and the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath97 depends on @xmath98 .",
    "there are two possibilities :    * @xmath99 * : * @xmath100 ; * @xmath101 * : * @xmath102 has no limit as @xmath103 .",
    "note that we can always choose @xmath98 so that it lies in the fundamental domain @xmath104 ( @xcite , proposition 1.5 ) . in the first situation ,",
    "@xmath105 are the only normalized periods that lie on the unit circle , so all of the terms in the sum ( [ eis ] ) vanish as @xmath57 apart from the contribution from @xmath106 . for the second possibility",
    ", @xmath107 lies on the lower boundary of @xmath108 , and ( by using the modular transformation @xmath109 ) it can always be assumed that @xmath110 ; then @xmath111 , with six normalized periods on the unit circle ( the sixth roots of unity ) , or otherwise there are four periods @xmath112 with modulus one .",
    "the extreme cases are the so called _ equianharmonic _ case ( @xmath111 ) , and the _ lemniscatic case _",
    "( @xmath113 ) .",
    "* equianharmonic case : * this corresponds to @xmath114 in ( [ wpeq ] ) . without loss of generality ( by rescaling )",
    "one may set @xmath115 and find half - periods [ omeqan ] _",

    "the laurent series for the @xmath10 function becomes @xmath120 with @xmath121 as in ( [ omeqan ] ) .",
    "there are six normalized periods @xmath122 , @xmath123 on the unit circle , so in the limit of the eisenstein series ( [ eis ] ) , only six terms survive to yield @xmath124 .",

    ".the oscillating values of @xmath125 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to consider the form of the quantities @xmath38 when @xmath114 , it is convenient to use the parameter @xmath126",
    ". thus we have the recursion ( [ rec1 ] ) with @xmath77 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and find that the structure of the iterates depends on the index mod 5 , so that @xmath130}c^{(m)}_{5n+p}\\ , \\alpha^{5m+p}\\lm^{n-6m - p } , \\qquad p=0,\\ldots,4 , \\ ] ] for certain rational numbers @xmath131 , which satisfy quadratic recurrence relations .",

    "this means that the generating function for @xmath140 satisfies a second order linear ode , within which the generating function of the @xmath135 appears as a coefficient .",
    "as we shall now see , this property extends to the recursive generation of all the sequences @xmath141 when @xmath142 . the linear recurrence solved by the general term @xmath141",
    "can be written explicitly as [ reccgen ] c^(m)_5n+p = k_n , p_k=1^n-1(_j=0^m_=0^p c^(j)_5k+c^(m - j)_5(n - k)+p-+_j=0^m-1_=1 ^ 4-pc^(j)_5k++pc^(m - j-1)_5(n - k)- ) , n2 , where @xmath143 is given by [ vnp ] k_n , p= , p=0,1,2,3,4 .",

    "for the case @xmath163 , it is helpful to introduce the parameter @xmath164 , and take the solution of ( [ rec1 ] ) with @xmath77 , @xmath165 , @xmath128 and @xmath166 .",

    "similarly to the situation for @xmath114 , linear odes for the generating functions of the rational numbers @xmath168 for @xmath182 can be constructed recursively , once the numbers @xmath135 are known .",
    "the tau - function for ( [ pi ] ) , related to @xmath3 by ( [ tau ] ) , satisfies a fourth order differential equation which is homogeneous of degree two .",
    "it is written in hirota bilinear form as [ bil ] d_z^4 -(12z + g_2)^2 = 0 , where the hirota derivative @xmath183 is defined by @xmath184 .",

    "as well as their potential uses for numerical calculations , it would be interesting to use the recursions in theorems [ cthm ] and [ cthm2 ] to prove directly that @xmath61 is holomorphic ( hence providing yet another proof of the fact that all solutions of @xmath0 are meromorphic ) .",
    "finally , we should mention that all of the painlev equations give deformations of elliptic functions , and they all have associated tau - functions and bilinear equations @xcite , so the same methods could be applied to @xmath245 .",
    "we also note that exact series formulae for @xmath246 tau - functions have been obtained recently from a completely different perspective , in terms of correlation functions in 2d conformal field theory @xcite .",
