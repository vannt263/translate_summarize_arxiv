    "studying the coupled dynamics of granular matter of different shapes and sizes is of great interest for a range of phenomena .",
    "one example is the size segregation of particles as a result of vibrations .",
    "a typical realization is a can with nuts ; upon shaking the larger ( often taken to be brazil ) nuts rise to the top . because of its wide interest the phenomenon has been considered and reconsidered and while some of the aspects are well - understood not everything has stopped surprising . if one asks for an analysis starting at the microscopic level the situation is not so satisfactory and even simple models have escaped serious mathematical handling ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite for further references ) .",
    "in this paper we consider such a microscopic  _ albeit _ stochastic  dynamics for the motion of a large particle or rod in a lattice fluid composed of monomers .",
    "the problem of the present paper is however not quite similar to the canonical brazil nuts scenario as we are interested in the equilibrium dynamics .",
    "in fact , as we will see , on the time scale of the motion of the rod , the monomers are in equilibrium for a reversible density profile .",
    "the rod then finds its hydrodynamic equilibrium at a vertical height where the density of the fluid is about equal to its own density .",
    "going beyond equilibrium conditions , e.g. starting from a homogeneous density for the lattice fluid , gives rise to additional mathematical problems that we will only be touching at the end of the paper ( see section [ sect : remarks ] , remark 2 ) , and which will be the subject of future work .",
    "+ the result of this paper can be classified under the heading : how to obtain a markovian reduced dynamics ? this problem is of course a very common one in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics where one considers the system composed of various types of degrees of freedom .",
    "the dynamics is globally defined in which the various degrees of freedom are coupled . in some circumstances and under some limit procedures",
    "one then expects that some degrees of freedom of the system effectively decouple giving rise to an autonomous ( in many cases , markovian ) dynamics for a subset of degrees of freedom . in our case , it is the shaking , the speeding up of the monomer dynamics in the horizontal direction , that does the job . in this way , between any two moves of the polymer",
    ", the monomer configuration has the time to relax to its reversible measure and the polymer always sees the fluid in equilibrium .",
    "our main result is a mathematically rigorous proof of this dynamical decoupling between the motion of the rod and the monomer fluid when the monomer dynamics is ( infinitely ) speeded up ( at least ) in the horizontal direction ( orthogonal to the motion of the polymer ) . in that limit of",
    "excessive horizontal shaking the reduced dynamics of the polymer becomes that of a random walker with rates directly given in terms of the equilibrium fluid density .",
    "when @xmath0 ( the length of the polymer ) is sufficiently big ( depending on the rates for jumping up or down ) the polymer finds its most probable height around its mean position of order @xmath1 with a variance of order 1 . in the next section we describe the model and the result .",
    "the third section is devoted to the proofs .",
    "the final section contains an open problem and some additional remarks .",
    "for convenience we put the system on the square lattice @xmath2 .",
    "a point @xmath3 of the lattice has a ` vertical ' coordinate @xmath4 and a ` horizontal ' coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "we also write @xmath6 if , in the notation of the coordinates , we want to remember the site @xmath7 .",
    "+ the system contains a rigid polymer ( large particle , rod ) whose position at time @xmath8 is denoted by @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    "we allow the rod to move only vertically .",
    "the horizontal coordinate is fixed ( at 0 ) and @xmath9 takes values in @xmath10 ( thought of as the ` vertical ' axis ) . the same results would hold if the polymer also jumps horizontally at rate 1 .",
    "the polymer occupies @xmath11 lattice sites . if the polymer has position @xmath12 , then it occupies the region @xmath13 this region is forbidden for the monomers ( fluid particles ) .",
    "the monomer configuration is denoted by @xmath14 and we use @xmath15 to denote the random field of monomers at time @xmath8 .",
    "we have that @xmath16 if there is no monomer at site @xmath7 at time @xmath8 ; @xmath17 if there is a monomer at site @xmath7 at time @xmath8 .",
    "the dynamics will always be subject to the restriction ( exclusion ) that @xmath18 for @xmath19 ( the rod acts as an obstacle for the fluid motion ) .",
    "the full configuration space is denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "+      we now define the coupled dynamics for the polymer - monomers system .",
    "all motion is via jumping to vacant sites .",
    "there are the horizontal jumps of the monomers ( which we take symmetric and at rate @xmath21 ) , the vertical jumps of the monomers ( asymmetric at rate @xmath22 ) and the vertical jumps of the rod ( asymmetric at rate 1 ) .",
    "the asymmetry in the vertical direction models the presence of an external ( e.g. gravitational ) field acting on fluid matter and polymer but can in general be different for monomers and polymer .",
    "increasing the rates @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be used to simulate the greater mobility of the smaller particles upon shaking .",
    "we are most interested in the case where @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( horizontal shaking ) .",

    "let @xmath27 be a local function on @xmath28 ( i.e. , a function that depends on the configuration in a finite region of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the first part of the generator represents horizontal monomer - jumping : @xmath29 [ f(\\eta^{i , j},y ) - f(\\eta , y)]\\ ] ] where @xmath30 if @xmath31 if @xmath32 and @xmath33 otherwise ; the summation is over nearest neighbor pairs @xmath34 with the same vertical coordinate ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "of course this depends on the choice of parameters @xmath67 and @xmath22 and we will sometimes make this explicit in the notation . + a useful way to imagine",
    "the process is by associating two exponential clocks ( at rate @xmath68 respectively @xmath69 ) to the polymer : one clock gives rise to the trial times for the polymer to jump up , the other indicates the trials for the polymer to jump down . if , just before the trial time @xmath70 , say for jumping up , there are no monomers right above the polymer ( @xmath71 ) , then the jump is performed and at time @xmath70 the polymer is at height @xmath72 , otherwise it stays where it was . between the trial times of the polymer ,",
    "only the monomers move .",
    "the dynamics for the monomers for a fixed position of the polymer ( say at @xmath4 ) is generated by @xmath73 which can be read off from ( [ hori ] ) and ( [ vert ] ) .",
    "the associated semigroup is denoted by @xmath74 .",
    "now , the important thing where the ` equilibrium ' in the title of this paper refers to , is that @xmath75 is a reversible measure for @xmath74 .",

    "* proof : * reversibility of @xmath90 is immediate , and the condition @xmath86 guarantees that @xmath90 can be normalized ( i.e. @xmath91 ) .",

    "it is thus very natural that in this case the polymer will drift up and will float at a height where the fluid density is proportional to @xmath93 , see ( [ 220 ] ) and @xcite .    in order to study",
    "some global properties of the limiting random walk , in particular its behavior for large @xmath0 , we replace the discrete distribution @xmath90 on @xmath10 by a continuous distribution : @xmath94 here @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 . from ( [ zet ] )",
    "we can calculate the cumulants of the continuous distribution @xmath98 : in particular @xmath99 where @xmath100 . using the asymtotic expansion @xmath101 we obtain @xmath102 and all higher order cumulants are of order 1 as @xmath0 tends to infinity .",

    "in this section we state the main steps of the proof of theorem 2.1 . the reader may use this section as a guideline to the next section .",
    "the main idea of the proof is that in the limit @xmath113 the monomers are moving very fast in the horizontal directions and thus can reach equilibrium in the time between two successive jumps of the polymer",
    ". therefore the rate at which the polymer jumps , which is a function of the whole monomer configuration , can be replaced by the expectation of that rate in the equilibrium distribution of the monomer configuration .    as a first step ( lemma 3.1 )",
    "we identify the reversible equilibrium measure for the monomers for _ fixed _ position of the polymer .",
    "this is ( by reversibility ) the original reversible measure of the monomer gas without polymer , conditioned on having no monomers on the lattice sites occupied by the fixed polymer .    in a second step ( lemma 3.2-proposition 3.1 )",
    "we prove that in the limit @xmath113 any time dependent expectation of a function @xmath114 of both polymer position @xmath9 and monomer gas configuration @xmath15 can be replaced by the expectation of a new function depending only on the polymer position , and obtained from @xmath27 by integrating out the @xmath115 variables over the equilibrium measure .",
    "the main ingredients in the proof of that statement are    1 .",
    "discrepancies in the asymmetric exclusion process move as  second class particles \" which are a kind of random walkers .",

    "the monomer - fixed polymer equilibrium measure .    in the first two steps we obtain convergence of the distribution of the polymer position @xmath116 to the distribution of the random walk @xmath9 . to finish our proof , we still have to prove that the _ whole process _",
    "@xmath117 converges to the whole process @xmath118",
    "( i.e. the distributions on trajectories converge ) .",
    "this final step is made by first proving that any limiting process is markovian and next that there exists a limiting process ( tightness ) .",
