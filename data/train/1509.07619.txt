    "thanks to the use of smooth b - splines and nurbs , isogeometric methods @xcite have revitalized the interest for the use of smooth approximating functions for the numerical solution of partial differential equations .",

    "there are indeed many examples of isogeometric methods for @xmath7 order differential problems of relevant interest , such as kirchhoff - love plates / shells @xcite , the cahn - hilliard equation @xcite , and the navier - stokes - korteweg equation @xcite .    since higher dimensional spline spaces possess a tensor - product structure , the representation of domains that have a complex geometry is non - trivial . in this paper",
    "we focus on multi - patch representations .",

    "several studies have tackled the problem of constructing function spaces of @xmath4 or higher order smoothness . a first attempt to compare different ways to impose @xmath4-continuity in isogeometric analysis",
    "was presented in @xcite .",

    ". nevertheless , the construction of smooth isogeometric spaces with optimal approximation properties on complex geometries is still an open and challenging problem .",

    "away from extraordinary points ( left ) and @xmath2 everywhere ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    we review two different strategies for constructing smooth multi - patch geometries and corresponding isogeometric spaces .",
    "one possibility is to adopt a geometry parametrization which is globally smooth almost everywhere , with the exception of a neighborhood of the extraordinary points ( or edges in 3d ) , see figure  [ fig : triangle - param - comparison ] ( left ) .",
    "the other possibility is to use geometry parametrizations that are only @xmath2 at patch interfaces , see figure  [ fig : triangle - param - comparison ] ( right ) .",
    "the first option includes subdivision surfaces @xcite and the t - spline construction in @xcite and , while possessing attractive features , they seem to possess optimal approximation properties for some configurations , see @xcite , but in general lack accuracy @xcite . in our work",
    "we consider the second possibility , corresponding to the right part of figure  [ fig : triangle - param - comparison ] .",
    "the construction of @xmath4 isogeometric functions over a @xmath2 parametrization can be interpreted conveniently as geometric continuity @xmath5 of the graph parametrization .",
    "bilinear multi - patch parametrizations of a planar domain have been analyzed in @xcite , where it is shown that there exists a minimal determining set with local degrees of freedom for the space of ( mapped ) piecewise polynomial functions , with global @xmath4 continuity , if the polynomial degree is high enough ( @xmath8 if some additional conditions are fulfilled , @xmath9 in general ) .",

    "we recall that within the isogeometric framework , the concept of @xmath3-refinement , equivalent to knot insertion , is one of the three constructions to increase accuracy of the spline spaces ( see @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , @xcite gives numerical evidence of optimal convergence for @xmath4 splines of degree @xmath10 ( or higher ) , on a two - patch bilinear geometry .",

    "we refer to the latter situation as _",
    "locking_. our work develops the underlying theory .",
    "while the previous papers give explicit charaterizations in the form of minimal determining sets @xcite or basis constructions @xcite , we use an implicit characterization of the continuity conditions and derive from it information on the structure of the isogeometric space . as in @xcite",

    "<S> we also consider examples of geometry parametrizations that are not analysis - suitable , showing that in this case optimal convergence of @xmath4 isogeometric spaces is prevented . </S>"
