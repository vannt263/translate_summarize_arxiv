    "increasing precision of sparticle spectrum calculations is an important part of theoretical preparation for the lhc and the ilc .",
    "much of this work has concentrated on the msugra scenario , where it is assumed that the unification of gauge couplings at high energies is accompanied by a corresponding unification in both the soft -breaking scalar masses and the gaugino masses ; and also that the cubic scalar interactions are of the same form as the yukawa couplings and related to them by a common constant of proportionality , the @xmath1-parameter .",
    "this paradigm is not , however , founded on a compelling underlying theory and therefore it is worthwhile exploring other possibilities .    in this paper",
    "we focus on anomaly mediation ( am )  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is a framework in which a single mass parameter determines the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 -breaking terms in terms of calculable and moreover renormalisation group ( rg ) invariant functions of the dimensionless couplings , in an elegant and predictive way ; too predictive , in fact , in that the theory in its simplest form leads to tachyonic sleptons and fails to accommodate the usual electroweak vacuum state .",
    "there is a natural solution to this , however , which restores the correct vacuum while retaining the rg invariance ( and hence the ultra - violet insensitivity ) of the predictions .",
    "this is achieved simply ( and without introducing another source of explicit -breaking ) by the introduction of a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) @xmath0-term or terms .",
    "this possibility was first explored in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently by a number of authors  @xcite-@xcite . the main purpose of this paper is to present the most precise spectrum calculations to date in the amsb scenario .",
    "we also show how the low energy theory employed can arise in a natural way from a theory with an additional anomaly - free @xmath5 broken at a high scale .",
    "we examine the decoupling in this case and show how only the soft mass contributions from the @xmath0-terms remain , which can naturally eliminate the tachyonic slepton problem .",
    "this provides a minimal extension of anomaly mediation .    in the original scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , fi terms corresponding to two distinct @xmath5 groups were introduced , one being the standard model @xmath5 , and the other the second mixed - anomaly - free ( or completely anomaly - free if right - handed neutrinos are included ) @xmath5 admitted by the mssm .",
    "this @xmath5 may be chosen to be @xmath6  @xcite , or some linear combination of it and the mssm @xmath5  @xcite . or , as emphasised in ref .",
    "@xcite , a single new @xmath5 may be employed if the charges are chosen appropriately . if these fi terms are added to the masses with constant coefficients ( as in eq .",
    "[ eq : ae ] below ) rather than as genuine gauge linear @xmath0-terms , then as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and at more length in ref  @xcite , the choices made in refs  @xcite-@xcite are simply reparametrisations of each other .",
    "as indicated above , we will see how this scenario can emerge naturally at low energies in a specific theory with an additional gauged anomaly - free @xmath5 .",
    "the mssm is defined by the superpotential : w = h_2 q y_t t^c + h_1 q y_b b^c + h_1 l y _ ^c + h_1 h_2 with soft breaking terms : l_soft & = & _ m_^2^*+ & + & where in general @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath9 matrices .",
    "we work throughout in the approximation that the yukawa matrices are diagonal , and neglect the yukawa couplings of the first two generations .",
    "remarkably the following results are rg invariant :    m_i & = & m_0 _ g_i / g_ih_t , b , & = & -m_0_y_t , b,(m^2)^i_j & = & m_0 ^ 2^i_jm_3 ^ 2 & = & m_0 - m_0 _ [ eq : ad ] here @xmath10 are the gauge @xmath11-functions , @xmath12 the chiral supermultiplet anomalous dimension , and @xmath13 are the yukawa @xmath11-functions . moreover ,",
    "the rg invariance is preserved if we replace @xmath14 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ad ] by ( ^2)^i_j = m_0 ^ 2^i_j , + ky_i^i_j , [ eq : ae ] where @xmath15 is a constant and @xmath16 are charges corresponding to a @xmath5 symmetry of the theory with no mixed anomalies with the gauge group .",
    "of course the @xmath17 term corresponds in form to a fi @xmath0-term .",
    "the expressions for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 given in eq .",
    "[ eq : ad ] are obtained if the only source of breaking is a vev in the supergravity multiplet itself : the amsb scenario ( @xmath21 is then the gravitino mass ) .",
    "note the parameter @xmath22 in the solution for @xmath23 ; some treatments in the literature omit this term ( based on top - down considerations ) .",
    "however , eq .  [ eq : ad ] is rg invariant for arbitrary @xmath22 and so we retain it .",
    "this means that @xmath23 will be determined in the usual way by the electroweak minimisation . in the following two sections we will show how eq .  [ eq : ae ]",
    "can arise via spontaneous breaking of a @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "the mssm ( including right - handed neutrinos ) admits two independent generation - blind anomaly - free @xmath5 symmetries .",
    "the possible charge assignments are shown in table  1 .    .[anomfree]anomaly",
    "free @xmath5 symmetry for arbitrary lepton doublet and singlet charges @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 4 in    _ fig .  2 : the light cp - even higgs mass @xmath27 as a function of @xmath28 , for @xmath29 .",

    "_ = 4 in    _ fig .  5 : the @xmath33-sneutrino mass as a function of @xmath28 , for @xmath29 . _",
    "by taking appropriate linear combinations of masses it is straightforward to derive a set of interesting sum rules  @xcite .    in the following equations , if we substitute the tree values for the various masses on the left hand side , the @xmath34 dependent terms and the electroweak breaking contributions to the masses cancel .",
    "we have calculated the numerical coefficients on the right hand side from table  2 , using the two - loop sparticle mass predictions ; it is easy to then check that to the indicated accuracy the same equations hold for the results in tables  4 , 5 .",
    "thus these sum rules are to an excellent approximation independent of @xmath34 , and also in fact of @xmath21 ; the numerical coefficients are slowly varying functions of @xmath28 and the input top pole mass .",
    "m__1 ^ 2+m__2 ^ 2+m__1 ^ 2+m__2 ^ 2 - 2m_t^2 & = & 2.76(m_)^2 m__1 ^ 2+m__2 ^ 2+m__1 ^ 2+m__2 ^ 2 - 2m_t^2 & = & 1.14(m_)^2 .",

    "[ eq : sumc ]    the existence of these sum rules will be a useful distinguishing feature of the amsb scenario .",
    "despite remarkable advances in the understanding of string theory , a coherent high energy theory spawning the mssm as an effective low energy theory remains elusive . this has led to exploration of such outr possibilities as little higgs models and split supersymmetry .",
    "remaining within the conservative world of low energy , the amsb scenario is an attractive alternative to ( and easily distinguished from ) msugra .",
    "we have shown how a @xmath24 gauge symmetry broken at high energies can lead in a natural way to the fi - solution to the tachyonic slepton problem in the context of anomaly mediation .",
    "the result is a sparticle spectrum described by the parameter set @xmath35 ; and it is only for a comparatively restricted set of @xmath34 that an acceptable spectrum is obtained .",
    "moreover we have presented a set of sum rules which are independent of @xmath21 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . at the very least , the scenario we describe has the merit of being immediately testable should sparticles be discovered in experiments at the lhc .",
