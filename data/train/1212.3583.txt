    "microtubules ( mts ) are one of the main components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells .",
    "their static and dynamic properties are essential for many cellular processes .",
    "mts serve as pathways for molecular motor proteins @xcite and contribute to cell stiffness @xcite .",
    "dynamic mts play a crucial role in the constant reorganization of the cytoskeleton , and single mts can generate polymerization forces up to several pn @xcite .",
    "these forces are used in various intracellular positioning processes @xcite , such as positioning of the cell nucleus @xcite or chromosomes during mitosis , establishing cell polarity @xcite , or regulation of cell shapes @xcite . in many cellular processes ,",
    "mts establish and maintain a characteristic length in response to forces exerted , for example , from the confining cell cortex @xcite .",
    "the fast spatial reorganization of mts is based on the dynamic instability : polymerization phases are stochastically interrupted by catastrophes which initiate phases of fast depolymerization ; fast depolymerization terminates stochastically in a rescue event followed again by a polymerization phase @xcite .",
    "this complex dynamic behavior with catastrophes and rescue events is central to a rapid remodelling of mts in the cytoskeleton , but it also affects their ability to generate polymerization forces .",
    "we will show that , in general , the dynamic instability _ decreases _ the average polymerization force of a single mt .    in this article",
    "we theoretically investigate the polymerization dynamics of a single mt under force or confinement and in the presence of the mt dynamic instability .",
    "we use a coarse - grained polymerization model with dynamic instability and characterize spatial and temporal behavior in three different scenarios , which mimic typical cellular environments that can also be reproduced _ in vitro _ :",
    "( i ) _ confinement : _ the mt is confined between fixed rigid walls , which can not be deformed by the microtubule .",
    "such confinement is realized in fixed solid chambers @xcite .",
    "( ii ) _ constant force : _ a constant force is acting on the mt .",
    "constant forces can be realized by optical tweezers with a force clamp control @xcite .",
    "( iii ) _ elastic obstacle : _ the microtubule grows against an elastic obstacle , which resists further growth by a force growing linearly with displacement .",
    "elastic forces can be realized by optical tweezers without force clamp @xcite .",
    "for all three confinement scenarios ( i)(iii ) we focus on the resulting length distributions of mts and for scenarios ( ii ) and ( iii ) , we calculate the polymerization force that a single mt can generate .",
    "dynamic mts also initiate regulation processes or are subject to regulation .",
    "dynamic mts can activate or deactivate proteins upon contacting the cell membrane @xcite , or they can activate actin polymerization within the cell cortex @xcite . at the same time , polymerizing mts are also targets of cellular regulation mechanisms @xcite , which affect their dynamic properties .",
    "the dynamic instability of mts enables various regulation mechanisms of mt dynamics .",
    "catastrophes and rescues result from the hydrolysis of gtp - tubulin within mts .",
    "when gtp - tubulin is incorporated into the tip of a growing mt , it forms a stabilizing gtp - cap .",
    "the loss of this gtp - cap due to hydrolysis of gtp - tubulin to gdp - tubulin , causes a catastrophe @xcite . in living cells",
    ", there are various microtubule associated proteins ( maps ) that either stabilize or destabilize microtubules and regulate microtubule dynamics both spatially and temporally @xcite .",
    "recently , the importance of maps in connection with the plus end of growing mts has been recognized @xcite .",
    "stabilizing maps bind to assembled mts , thereby reducing the catastrophe rate or increasing the rescue rate .",
    "destabilizing maps such as op18/stathmin bind to gtp - tubulin dimers , thus decreasing the available gtp - tubulin concentration , which in turn decreases the growth velocity of the gtp - cap and makes catastrophes more likely .",
    "therefore , such mechanisms can regulate basic parameters in our model , such as the available gtp - tubulin concentration or the rescue rate , and we will systematically study their influence on the generated polymerization force for the three confinement scenarios ( i)(iii ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the mt model and the basic notation are introduced .",
    "we also discuss the catastrophe model and the underlying hydrolysis mechanism in the absence and in the presence of a resisting force .",

    "the mt dynamics in the presence of its dynamic instability is described in terms of probability densities and switching rates @xcite . in the growing state ,",
    "a mt polymerizes with average velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the mt stochastically switches from a state of growth ( @xmath2 ) to a state of shrinkage ( @xmath3 ) with the catastrophe rate @xmath4 . in the shrinking state",
    ", it rapidly depolymerizes with an average velocity @xmath5 ( table[tab : parameters ] ) . with the rescue rate @xmath6 the mt stochastically switches from a state of shrinkage back to a state of growth .",
    "we model catastrophes and rescues as poisson processes such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the average times spent in the growing and shrinking states , respectively .",
    "the stochastic time evolution of an ensemble of independent mts , growing along the x - axis , can be described by two coupled master equations for the probabilities @xmath9 and @xmath10 of finding a mt with length @xmath11 at time @xmath12 in a growing or shrinking state , @xmath13 in the following , we will always use a reflecting boundary at @xmath14 : a mt shrinking back to zero length undergoes a forced rescue instantaneously .",

    "the solution exhibits two different growth phases : a phase of bounded growth and a phase of unbounded growth .    in the phase of bounded growth the average length loss during a period of shrinkage , @xmath18 , exceeds the average length gain during a period of growth , @xmath19 .",

    "there is no steady state solution , and for long times @xmath20 asymptotically approaches a gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath29 centered on an average length which approaches linear growth @xmath30 with a mean velocity @xmath31 and with diffusively growing width @xmath32 with a diffusion constant @xmath33 .",
    "the average growth velocity is given by @xmath34 because the asymptotic probabilities to be in a growing or shrinking state are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",

    "we will use catastrophe models , where the catastrophe rate @xmath41 is a function of the growth velocity @xmath1 , which in turn is determined by the gtp - tubulin concentration via the gtp - tubulin on - rate @xmath42 ( assuming a fixed off - rate @xmath43 ) .",
    "moreover , experimental data suggest that @xmath44 is fixed to values close to @xmath45 m / s ( table  [ tab : parameters ] ) . as a consequence , there are two tunable control parameters left , the gtp - tubulin concentration or , equivalently , the tubulin on - rate @xmath42 and the rescue rate @xmath38 .",
    "these are the control parameters we will explore for mts in confinements and under force .",
    "these parameters are also targets for regulation by maps , such as op18/stathmin , which reduces @xmath42 by binding to gtp - tubulin dimers or map4 , which increases the rescue rate @xmath38 .      in a growing state ,",
    "gtp - tubulin dimers are attached to any of the 13 protofilaments with the rate @xmath42 , which is directly related to the gtp concentration .",
    "we explore a regime @xmath46 , see table  [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "gtp - tubulin dimers are detached with the rate @xmath47 @xcite such that we can typically assume @xmath48 . in the absence of force or restricting boundaries ,",
    "the velocity of growth is given by @xmath49 here @xmath50 denotes the effective dimer size @xmath51 .",
    "the classical view of the mt catastrophe mechanism is based on a purely chemical model of catastrophes , where the catastrophe rate @xmath41 is determined by the hydrolysis dynamics of gtp - tubulin @xcite . when gtp - tubulin is incorporated into the tip of a growing mt",
    ", it forms a stabilizing gtp - cap . in a chemical model ,",
    "the loss of this gtp - cap due to hydrolysis of gtp - tubulin to gdp - tubulin directly causes a catastrophe .",
    "however , recent research indicates that the `` structural plasticity '' of the mt lattice can play a role for the kinetics of catastrophes @xcite .",
    "this structural plasticity mechanism is based on the assumption that gdp - tubulin prefers a curved configuration , which generates additional mechanical stresses in the mt by hydrolysis .",
    "also in the presence of structural plasticity , the loss of the gtp - cap has a destabilizing effect , but the kinetics leading to a catastrophe can be more complicated because the initiation of a catastrophe event is similar to the nucleation of a crack in the stressed mt lattice within this model . in this article , we focus on purely chemical catastrophe models and neglect mechanical effects on the catastrophe kinetics .    within a chemical catastrophe model , the loss of the gtp - cap due to hydrolysis of gtp - tubulin to gdp - tubulin triggers a catastrophe immediately .",
    "therefore , the catastrophe rate @xmath41 is given by the first - passage rate to a state with vanishing gtp - cap and has been discussed within a model with cooperative hydrolysis @xcite , where gtp - tubulin is hydrolyzed by a combination of random and vectorial mechanisms ; similar models have also been discussed for hydrolysis in f - actin @xcite . in random hydrolysis ,",
