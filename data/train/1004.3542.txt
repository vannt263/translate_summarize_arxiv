    "this weak lensing or cosmic shear signals measures a combination of the total matter distribution projected along the line - of - sight and the angular diameter distance .",

    "gravitational lensing is one of the most promising methods of constraining cosmology including the nature of dark energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are various on - going and planned surveys aimed at studying dark energy through the high - precision weak lensing measurements : the cfht legacy survey , the hyper suprime - cam weak lensing survey @xcite , the dark energy survey ( des ) , and ultimately large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , euclid @xcite , and joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) .",
    "how should we analyze these new lensing data set ?",
    "most researchers use the two - point correlation function to characterize the cosmic shear signals .",
    "the correlation function method can be easily applied to complex survey geometries involving partial sky coverage and masked regions . however , the errors in the measurement are highly correlated between different bins ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the detailed studies ) . even if the shear field follows gaussian statistics , which is a good approximation in the linear regime , there are large correlations between different angular - scale bins .",
    "these correlations are even larger , and more model - dependent on the smaller scales that contain most of the current observational information . since the accurate estimate of the covariances is essential for robust cosmological constraints , a large number of numerical simulations are necessary @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum , the fourier- or harmonic - transformed counterpart of the two - point correlation function , is an alternative means of measuring the cosmic shear correlations .",
    "whilst the correlation function and power spectrum are mathematically equivalent , the power spectrum measurement of cosmic shear has been used less ( see the combo 17-survey by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the power spectrum approach has a number of advantages : its theoretical interpretation is simpler and there are weaker correlations between band powers at different multipoles .",
    "for example , the different bins are independent for the gaussian field or on large angular scales . even for small angular scales affected by nonlinear structure formation",
    ", the power spectrum covariances are relatively well understood through both analytical models and simulations of nonlinear structure formation @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage is the presence of finite sky coverage and masked regions , which breaks the orthogonality of fourier / harmonic components .",
    "one needs to properly deal with the survey geometry effect to estimate unbiased power spectrum .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to eliminate this disadvantage .",
    "we employ the _ pseudo _ power spectrum technique , which is well developed in the cmb studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for the first time , we apply the method to recover the lensing power spectrum from the shear field taking into account incomplete survey geometry . to assess the performance of this method , we make simulated shear maps including a realistic configuration of masked regions due to bright stars and saturated spikes .",
    "furthermore , we develop the method for both the full - sky and flat - sky approaches .",
    "the full - sky approach is adequate for reconstructing large angular - scale modes that are relevant for the curvature of the sky . on the other hand ,",
    "the flat - sky approach should serve as a practically useful approximation of sub - degree scale modes , which carry most of useful cosmological information in the shear power spectrum .",
    "we find that the pseudo power spectrum method allows for an unbiased estimate of the underlying @xmath0-mode power spectrum over a range of angular scales we study .",
    "we also show that the residual @xmath2-mode power spectrum , which is leaked from @xmath0-mode power due to an imperfect reconstruction , can be well suppressed .",
    "our method can be applied to the existing data and forthcoming weak lensing surveys .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : method ] describes the pseudo spectrum method to deconvolve shear power spectra with inhomogeneous survey mask .",
    "section [ sec : simulations ] describes the simulation maps we use to test the deconvolution method .",
    "we employ two different simulation maps : one is gaussian shear maps and the other is the ray - tracing simulations of shear maps including the non - gaussian effects due to nonlinear structure formation .",
    "section [ sec : results ] shows the results of both the full - sky and flat - sky approaches . section  [ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly review a method for reconstructing shear power spectra from the pseudo - spectrum estimators .",
    "we take into account an imperfect survey geometry due to survey boundary and masking effect .",
    "the method is analogous to the one used in estimating cmb polarization power spectra @xcite .      since the shear field is a spin-2 field , the @xmath0- and @xmath2-mode harmonic coefficients of the shear fields @xmath3",
    "can be expressed in the spherical harmonic expansion as @xmath4 ~ { } _ { \\pm 2}y_{lm}^{\\ast}(\\hat{\\mathbf n}),\\ ] ] and the inverse relation is @xmath5 ~ { } _ { \\pm 2}y_{lm}(\\hat{\\mathbf n}),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the spin-2 spherical harmonics , and @xmath7 denotes the unit vector specifying the angular direction on the sky .",
    "the integration range is over the full sky .    in the linear regime , the statistical information in the map is fully encoded in the power spectra @xmath8 in the single lens limit , the shear field arising from a scalar gravitational field should be a gradient or curl - free field ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the multiple lensing effect generates b - mode power spectrum , but their power is @xmath10 times smaller than the e - mode power .",
    "thus the @xmath0-mode power spectrum effectively contains all information on the cosmic shear , i.e. @xmath0-mode power spectrum is equivalent to that of the projected mass density along the line - of - sight between source galaxies and an observer .",
    "hence the @xmath2-mode can be used as a monitor of residual systematic effects .",
    "the standard methods to separate @xmath11 mode correlation functions involve integrals of the measured correlation functions down to arbitrary small scale or up to very large scale .",
    "as the scale range accessible from a finite sky data is limited , residual uncertainties are generated ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite for a new method using the limited - range integration of correlation function to separate the @xmath0-mode ) .",
    "observational effects , such as a finite sky coverage and bright star masks , limit the survey area to a region @xmath12 .",
    "the observed shear field is modified as @xmath13 without weighting , @xmath14 if the position vector @xmath15 lies in masked regions or regions outside the survey , otherwise @xmath16 within the survey . this finite sky coverage couples modes and generate artificial @xmath2 modes .",
    "we can describe the observed shear fields in terms of `` pseudo e and b modes '' , denoted as @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 { } _ { \\pm 2}y_{lm}^{\\ast}(\\hat{\\mathbf n}).\\ ] ] these pseudo e and b modes are related to the true e and b modes as @xmath20 through a convolution kernel , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are known as the wigner @xmath23 symbols ( see the references in * ? ? ?",

    "the power at the lowest bin ( @xmath169 ) is affected by the unseen modes larger than the surveyed region and thus the reconstructed power at the lowest bin varies with the chosen minimum @xmath43 and the binning width .",
    "when the minimum @xmath43 is taken to be slightly larger than @xmath170 , we find that the reconstructed power becomes almost equal to the input power .",
    "the accuracy is limited by the statistical errors due to insufficient sampling of such large - angle modes . the power spectrum without correcting for a finite - sky effect ( dashed line ) is smaller than the input power spectrum ( solid line ) .",
    "the amplitude offset is roughly determined by the square of unmasked fraction times the survey area fraction , @xmath171 square degree divided by @xmath172 steradian , that is about @xmath173 .    summarizing the results in figs .",
    "[ fig : nbody ] and [ fig : gauss ] the pseudo - spectrum method recovers the input power spectrum at a sub - percent accuracy over a wide range of multipoles down to @xmath174 . as seen from the top panels , the ratio between the true and reconstructed spectra is close to unity over a range of multipoles we study .",
    "the scatters of the ratio from unity imply possible biases in the @xmath0-mode power spectrum reconstruction at each multipole bin , and are smaller than the statistical errors of power spectrum measurement expected for a survey of 2000 sq .",
    "deg . coverage .",
    "the residual @xmath2-mode power spectrum is suppressed below a percent level .",
    "finite - sky effect makes the errors of the shear power spectra correlate between different bins . in this subsection",
    "we study this effect using the simulated maps .",
    "let s start our discussion using gaussian fields .",
    "the statistical errors of the binned power spectrum is given , in the absence of shot noise , as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the sky fraction of survey area and @xmath109 is the number of modes available around the @xmath41-th bin .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] compares the gaussian expectation ( [ eq : error ] ) with the statistical errors in the @xmath0-mode power spectrum of 1000 gaussian shear fields .",
    "when the multipole bin width is taken as @xmath177 , 2.5 times wider than the the fundamental mode @xmath178 , the errors for the simulation results are greater than the gaussian expectation .",
    "the limit of sky area and mask causes correlated errors between neighboring multipole bins and increases the errors by @xmath179-@xmath180% over a range of multipoles . when the bin width is enough wide such as @xmath181 , the power spectrum errors become similar to the gaussian expectations , and the spectra at different bins become nearly independent .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : error ] compares the error of the reconstructed shear power relative to the unmasked convergence power using the ray - tracing simulations , which contain the non - gaussian error due to nonlinear clustering in structure formation . at a bin width @xmath182 ,",
    "a factor 3 wider than the fundamental mode @xmath183 , the power spectrum errors increase by about 5% on small multipoles , while the correlated errors are well suppressed at a wider binning @xmath184 .",
    "note that the gaussian errors depend on the bin width of multipoles , while the non - gaussian errors do not : a wider bin relatively suppresses the gaussian error contribution . as studied in @xcite ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the non - gaussian error contribution is significant at multipoles @xmath185 for the @xmath123cdm model .",
    "since most of useful cosmological information in the shear power spectrum resides in the modes around @xmath186 in the presence of the shot noise , @xcite showed that even a factor 2 increase in the power spectrum errors at the multipoles degrades accuracies of cosmological parameters only by 10 - 20% .",
    "therefore , the correlated errors due to the survey geometry effect have an insignificant impact on parameter estimation .",
    "we develop a pseudo - spectrum method for reconstructing the cosmic shear power spectra from actual lensing data .",
    "the observed shear field is limited to be a finite patch of sky and furthermore roughly 25% of the survey area is masked due to bright stars .",
    "we apply for the first time the pseudo - spectrum technique developed in cmb studies to the lensing field and show that our method successfully recovers the shear spectra over a wide range of multipoles from @xmath187 to @xmath188 in both full- and flat - sky approaches .",
    "we test the flat - sky method using ray - tracing simulations assuming a square - shaped survey region .",
    "the 25% fraction of the total area is masked by realistic configurations for a ground - based survey : circular shapes for bright stars ; rectangular shapes for bright star spikes ; zero padding in one direction for bad pixels .",
    "we show that both the full- and flat - sky methods reconstruct the input @xmath0-mode power spectrum in sub - percent accuracy and the residuals are much smaller than the statistical errors of a power spectrum measurement for a survey of 2000 square degree coverage .",
    "the residual @xmath2-mode power spectrum from the @xmath11-mode mixing due to the imperfect correction of survey geometry is also suppressed below a percent of the @xmath0-mode power spectrum .",
    "our method offers a new means of measuring the cosmic shear correlations and separating the @xmath11 modes from an actual survey data .",
    "although the pseudo - spectrum technique is promising , our method still yields sub - percent residual of @xmath2-mode in the reconstructed power spectra . to further suppress the @xmath2-mode spectrum , one has to remove `` ambiguous mode '' that is inevitably generated in a finite patch of sky @xcite .",
    "the ambiguous mode satisfies both the @xmath0-mode ( rotation - free ) and the @xmath2-mode conditions ( divergence - free ) and thus contaminates e / b - mode spectrum reconstructed using the simple pseudo - spectrum method that we adopt . to eliminate such contamination",
    ", @xcite introduces pure e / b modes that is orthogonal to the ambiguous modes .",
    "pure pseudo @xmath189 estimator and its optimization technique of sky apodization have been developed @xcite .",
    "this technique can be straightforwardly applied to the lensing case .    in this paper",
    "we assume that masked regions are uncorrelated with the cosmological shear field . in reality the regions with large shear",
    "is preferentially masked : in a region of massive clusters , we can not obtain a fair sample of background galaxies in the central region due to the dense concentration of member galaxies , where the shearing effect on background galaxies are greater . masking such a crowded region",
    "may bias the power spectrum measurement .",
    "this contaminating effect can be estimated by combining ray - tracing simulations with halo catalogs in the underlying n - body simulations .",
