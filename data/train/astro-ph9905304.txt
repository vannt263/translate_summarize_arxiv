    "the bepposax satellite ( boella et al .  1997 ) has brought a new dimension to gamma - ray burst ( grb ) research , by rapidly providing good localization of several bursts per year .",
    "this has allowed many grbs to be followed up at other wavelengths , including x - ray ( costa et al .  1997 ) , optical ( van paradijs et al .  1997 ) and radio ( frail et al .  1997 ) .",
    "good positions have also allowed redshifts to be measured for a number of grbs ( e.g.grb 970508 : metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , providing a definite proof for their cosmological origin .",
    "grb 990510 was detected by bepposax ( piro et al .",
    "1999 ) on may 10.36743 ut , and the fluence was among the highest of the bepposax localized events , after grb 990123 , grb 980329 , and grb 970111 ( amati et al .",
    "it was also detected by batse ( kippen et al .",
    "1999 ) and its peak flux and fluence rank it in the top 4% ( 9% ) of batse burst flux ( fluence ) distributions .",
    "the bepposax nfis follow - up of grb 990510 started about 8 hours after the burst ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1999 ) and detected a strong x - ray afterglow .",
    "axelrod , mould & schmidt ( 1999 ) were the first to optically monitor the field of grb 990510 , starting on 10.514 ut , i.e.  only @xmath9 after the burst , using the mount stromlo 50-inch telescope .",
    "the optical counterpart to grb 990510 was first identified by vreeswijk et al .",
    "( 1999a ) with data taken about @xmath10 ( may 10.73 ut ) after the burst , using the sutherland 1.0-m telescope .",

    "1996 ) , making the afterglow as bright as @xmath18 when first observed by axelrod et al .",
    "this change in calibration was confirmed by independent photometric calibration of the grb field by pietrzyski & udalski ( 1999a ) and bloom et al .",

    "analysis of more data has confirmed this behavior ( hjorth et al .",
    "1999 ; bloom et al .  1999 ; marconi et al .",

    "is shown in figure  [ fig : field ] .",
    "the data were reduced using two different methods .",
    "first , we have used the photometric data pipeline of the the direct project ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1998 ; stanek et al .  1998 ) , which is based on the daophot psf - fitting image reduction package ( stetson 1987 ; 1992 ) . to check the consistency of the differential photometry we have also employed the image subtraction method of alard & lupton ( 1999 ) and alard ( 1999a ) , as implemented in the isis image subtraction package ( alard 1999b ) . we have found a very good agreement between these two data reduction methods ( @xmath29mag ) .",
    "the calibration for the field has been obtained by pietrzyski & udalski ( 1999a , b ) in the @xmath30 bands and by bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the @xmath31 bands . in both cases",
    "the quoted uncertainty of the calibration zero point is @xmath32mag for the @xmath33 bands and @xmath34mag for the @xmath6-band .",
    "comparison of the @xmath24-band measurements for three secondary standards given by pietrzyski & udalski ( 1999a , b ) and bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the grb field yields a systematic difference of @xmath35 , i.e. within the quoted uncertainty .",
    "we have adopted the calibration of pietrzyski & udalski ( 1999a , b ) for the @xmath30 bands and the calibration of bloom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the @xmath15-band .",
    "we plot the grb 990510 @xmath0 lightcurves in figure  [ fig : time ] .",
    "most of the data comes from our monitoring ( kaluzny et al .",
    "1999a , b ; stanek et al .  1999 ) and from the ogle project ( pietrzyski & udalski 1999a , b , c ) .",
    "we use those ogle points which extend the time coverage beyond that of our data .",
    "in addition , we use the early @xmath15-band data of axelrod et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and galama et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and later @xmath15-band data points of marconi et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) , and one late @xmath24-band point obtained by beuermann , reinsch & hessman ( 1999 ) .",
    "all these data extend beyond our time coverage and are therefore useful for constraining the time evolution of the afterglow .    as noticed by stanek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) using data from two days only , the optical @xmath15-band data already showed clear departure from the initial shallow power - law of about @xmath36 determined by galama et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) from the first day data .",
    "this trend of steepening decay was confirmed later by hjorth et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and others .    to describe the temporal evolution of the grb 990510 optical counterpart , we use the combined data described earlier and fit to each @xmath33 band separately the following four parameters formula ( similar to that of bloom et al .  1999 and",
    "marconi et al .",
    "1999a ) :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is a normalization constant specific for each band such that the magnitude is given by @xmath39 .",
    "this formula describes power - law @xmath40 decline at early times ( @xmath41 ) and another power - law @xmath42 decline at late times ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the total number of points used for the fits was 44 for the @xmath15-band , 32 for the @xmath24-band , 31 for the @xmath25-band and five for the @xmath6-band , total of 112 points .",
    "the @xmath15-band data has the most extensive temporal coverage , especially early after the burst .",
    "the other bands are not as well constrained , at least with data at hand , which demonstrates the importance of getting multi - band follow - up images as early as possible .",
    "the parameters are correlated with each other , so we first fit the @xmath15-band and then use the derived @xmath44 value as fixed for the @xmath45 bands .",
    "we also run a combined fit to all @xmath0 data .",
    "the results of this combined fit are shown as the continuous lines in the figure  [ fig : time ] and the best - fit parameters for all the fits are presented in table  [ table : par ] .",
    "the errors shown are based on conditional probability distributions , fixing two of the parameters at their most probable values .",
    "ccccc @xmath15 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & 1.51 + @xmath24 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & & 1.22 + @xmath25 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & & 1.03 + @xmath0 & @xmath53 & @xmath47 & @xmath54 & 1.48 [ table : par ]    the combined fit does a good job of representing the overall temporal behavior of the @xmath0 data set , but it is clearly dominated by the @xmath15-band data . considering that these data represent an inhomogeneous data set , the @xmath55 values for the @xmath45 bands are rather good .",
    "the @xmath55 is somewhat higher for the @xmath15-band .",
    "as our @xmath15-band data has somewhat better photometric accuracy than the @xmath45 data , this might indicate that we see some small , short - timescales departures from the analytical fit .",
    "our frequent observations of the grb optical counterpart during the first night were obtained to test for such rapid variations .",
    "after we subtract the long - term trend derived above , we get a root - mean - square ( @xmath56 ) scatter of @xmath57mag , with the largest deviation of @xmath58mag . comparing to constant field stars with similar magnitude ,",
    "the observed scatter is consistent with photometric noise .",
    "clearly , brightness variations on time scales from 0.1 to @xmath59 are small .",
    "we note that hjorth et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained similar @xmath56 scatter in their 31 @xmath60 @xmath15-band images , obtained with the 1.54-m telescope on la silla at times overlapping with our observations . by combining these two data sets",
    "one might be able to search with more sensitivity for correlated variations in the brightness of the afterglow .",
    "the grb 990510 is located at galactic coordinates of @xmath61 . to remove the effects of the galactic interstellar extinction we used the reddening map of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , hereafter : sfd ) .",
    "as noticed by stanek ( 1999 ) , the expected galactic reddening towards the burst is significant , @xmath62 , which corresponds to expected values of galactic extinction @xmath63 and @xmath64 , for the landolt ( 1992 ) ctio filters and standard reddening curve of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "we synthesize the @xmath0 spectrum from our data by interpolating the magnitudes to a common time .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the optical colors of the grb 990510 counterpart do not show significant variation .",
    "we therefore select an epoch of may 11.26 ut ( @xmath65 after the burst ) for the color analysis , which coincides with our first @xmath6-band images . using the all - band fit from the previous section we get for this epoch @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where the @xmath70mag error bar represents the combined uncertainty in the zero points calibration and the small measurement errors . using the sfd extinction values",
    ", this translates to unreddened values of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( following sfd we took the error in @xmath75 to be @xmath57mag ) .",
    "we convert the @xmath0 magnitudes to fluxes using the effective wavelengths and normalizations of fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa ( 1995 ) .",
    "these conversions are accurate to about 5% , which increases the error - bars correspondingly .",
    "note that while the error in the @xmath75 reddening value has not been applied to the error - bars of individual points , we include it in the error budget of the fitted slope .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] for both the observed and the dereddened magnitudes .",
    "the spectrum is well fitted by a single power - law with @xmath5 , although when the @xmath6-band point is dropped from the fit , the power - law becomes @xmath7 , indicating a possible deviation from the power - law in the blue part of the spectrum , either intrinsic or due to additional extinction outside our galaxy .",
    "we presented @xmath0 observations of the grb 990510 .",
    "our analysis of the data indicates steepening decay , independent of optical wavelength , with power - law behavior @xmath1 at early times ( @xmath2 and second power - law @xmath3 at late times , with the break time at @xmath76 .",
    "this is the first observed example of such broad - band break for a grb ot and it is very well documented thanks to a concerted effort of the astronomical community .",
    "we would like to stress the importance of multiband optical observations for the grb studies , especially early after the burst .    the optical spectral energy distribution , corrected for significant galactic reddening , is well fitted by a single power - law with @xmath5 .",
    "however , when the @xmath6-band point is dropped from the fit , the power - law becomes @xmath7 , indicating a possible deviation from the power - law in the spectrum , either intrinsic or due to additional extinction near the host or at the intervening galaxy at @xmath8 .",
    "the temporal behavior of grb 990510 is broadly similar to predictions of grb jet models ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "a break in the light curve is expected when the jet makes the transition to sideways expansion after the relativistic lorentz factor drops below the inverse of the opening angle of the initial beam . after the break , the the temporal power - law index is expected to approach the electron energy distribution index with values between 2.0 and 2.5 , which is consistent with the late - time decline observed here for grb 990510 ( halpern et al .  1999 ; sari , piran & halpern  1999 ) .",
    "however , the early - time decay index and the spectral slope of grb  990510 are not as well explained by the models .",
    "grb 990510 provides the first direct evidence that , in some cases , grb energy is not ejected isotropically .",
