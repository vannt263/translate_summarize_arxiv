    "the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) is a hypothetical process in which a nucleus undergoes two beta transitions , while neutrinos are not emitted , @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "this decay violates the electron lepton number by two units and we know from neutrino oscillations that the flavor lepton numbers are not conserved , in general .",
    "the @xmath0 decay also violates the total lepton number @xmath3 ; therefore , it requires some mechanism which allows for the total lepton number to be broken .",
    "the observation of the @xmath0 decay will also prove that neutrinos are majorana particles @xcite , regardless of the underlying nonstandard mechanism driving this process .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to study this problem .",
    "it is well known that neutrinos may undergo resonant flavor transitions when propagating through matter @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that the additional presence of a nonuniform magnetic field may induce transitions between neutrinos of different helicities .",
    "thus , to obtain the pontecorvo oscillations @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , a two - step process is necessary .",
    "this process will be driven by the interplay between the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath6 and the neutrino magnetic moment @xmath7 .",
    "the only magnetic moment for neutral particles can be induced in the second - order processes , and for neutrinos in the standard model ( sm ) this means a one - loop process defined by the interaction vertices of the form @xmath8 , which conserve the electrical charge and lepton number @xcite .",
    "the induced neutrino magnetic moment in the sm has been estimated to be @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the neutrino mass and @xmath11 is the bohr magneton .",
    "for the neutrino mass @xmath12  ev this yields @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "going beyond the standard model , e.g. , introducing supersymmetry , it is possible to enhance its value @xcite ; however , experimental bounds point towards values not greater than @xmath14 @xcite .    in the following",
    "we discuss the process of neutrino - antineutrino oscillations in nuclear matter with a nonuniform external magnetic field .",
    "we show that this process may be resonantly enhanced , boosting the half - life of the neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the presence of matter changes the energy levels of neutrinos through neutral and charged current reactions .",
    "the neutral current potential is given , in general , by ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fermi constant , @xmath17 the weinberg angle , @xmath18 the third component of the weak isospin , @xmath19 the electric charge , and @xmath20 denotes the number densities of the fermions . in the specific case of nuclear matter ,",
    "the electrons are absent , @xmath21 , and the contributions come from the nucleons only . as for the charged current interactions , they come from interactions between electron ( mu , tau ) neutrinos and electrons ( mu , tau leptons ) ,",
    "so in our case they will be absent as well .",
    "we conclude therefore that nuclear matter shifts the overall scale of the neutrino energy levels but does not distinguish between flavors or chiralities .",
    "the presence of an external magnetic field , however , distinguishes neutrinos from antineutrinos .",
    "let us denote by @xmath22 the component of the magnetic field projected on the plane perpendicular to the neutrino momentum .",
    "the direction of @xmath23 is described by the angle @xmath24 , and by @xmath25 we denote its time derivative . in what follows",
    "we summarize the main points that lead to neutrino - antineutrino transition , as they were discussed in refs .",
    "first , we switch to the coordinate system which rotates together with @xmath26 . in such a situation",
    "the energy correction to the spin @xmath27 neutrinos will be @xmath28 , while for the spin @xmath29 antineutrinos , it will be @xmath30 .    assuming that we have only two flavors of neutrinos and working in the basis @xmath31 the mixing matrix depends on one vacuum mixing angle only :",
    "@xmath32 furthermore one can write the hamiltonian in the general form @xmath33 \\\\",
    "-[b\\mu ] & h_{\\bar\\nu }      \\end{array } \\right ) , \\label{eq : h-2nu}\\ ] ] where the neutrino and antineutrino blocks are given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 . to obtain eqs .  (",
    "[ eq : h-2nu])([eq : m ] ) we have assumed that the energies of the mass eigenstate neutrinos @xmath37 are @xmath38 in the relativistic case , for which the average neutrino energy @xmath39 is approximately equal to its momentum @xmath40 .",
    "the off - diagonal blocks are @xmath41 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc }         0 & b\\mu_{e\\mu } \\\\ -b\\mu_{e\\mu } & 0       \\end{array } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the majorana neutrino transition magnetic moment . for majorana neutrinos",
    "the magnetic moment is antisymmetric ; therefore , transitions between same flavors are forbidden .    after the diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h-2nu ] ) one finds its eigenvalues in the form @xmath43 where the corrected neutrino masses are @xmath44 in this process the neutrino is a virtual particle ; as such it is not on its mass shell , so it is not bound by the relation @xmath45 .",
    "we identify the small splitting induced by the @xmath46 term with the neutrino - antineutrino masses , while the big splitting defines the first and second mass eigenstates .",
    "one sees clearly that in the absence of the @xmath47 term , the neutrinos and antineutrinos will have degenerate masses .",
    "we are interested in the process in which the electron neutrino emitted in one beta vertex is being absorbed as an electron antineutrino in the second beta vertex .",
    "this will describe , apart from the nuclear matrix element , the @xmath0 process .",
    "the internal line of a feynman diagram in question is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "decay driven by the magnetic moment of the neutrino . ]",
    "one has to notice first that neutrinos are produced and absorbed as flavor eigenstates ( electron neutrinos ) in each beta vertex , but they propagate through matter as mass eigenstates @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic moment @xmath49 connects neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath50 with an antineutrino mass eigenstate @xmath51 and is given by @xmath52 the propagation between two beta vertices , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is then described by @xmath53 where @xmath40 is the momentum exchanged between the beta vertices . in the two - neutrino case",
    "we have explicitly @xmath54 where the antisymmetric property of the magnetic moment has been used .",
    "we point out that a nonzero @xmath55 can have two sources .",
    "the difference in effective masses of neutrinos and antineutrinos , @xmath56 , is the first and most obvious one .",
    "however , even for degenerate masses , a nonzero @xmath55 appears if the @xmath6 matrix is not unitary .",
    "the general form of the neutrino mixing matrix contains complex phases which describe possible @xmath57 violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "these phases are unknown , although recent best - fit values @xcite suggest a small @xmath57 violation present in @xmath6 .",
    "the factor @xmath55 is related to the half - life of the @xmath0 decay through @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the phase space factor and @xmath60 is the nuclear matrix element calculated within a certain ( approximate ) nuclear model .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2 ] ) that the factor @xmath55 is resonantly enhanced around the poles in the denominators . the equality @xmath61 yields , from eq .",
    "( [ eq:2n - mass ] ) , @xmath62 as the magnetic field corrections are energy dependent , and the typical energy exceeds the mass eigenvalues by many orders of magnitude , the neutrino masses in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2n - mass ] ) are dominated by the factors proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "the average momentum transfer , which for relativistic neutrinos is comparable to the total energy @xmath39 , in a neutrinoless double beta decay is assessed from the nuclear radius and usually taken to be @xmath63  mev .",
    "the magnetic field strength @xmath26 can be realistically estimated to be of the order of @xmath64  t. the magnetic moment , on the other hand , does not exceed @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "neutrino masses squared @xmath66 and @xmath67 are of the order of @xmath68  ev @xcite . taking all of this into account , one finally arrives at the relation @xmath69 which defines , to a good approximation , the resonance condition . in the typical case of @xmath70  mev ,",
    "this yields @xmath71  hz .",
    "neutrino propagating in a nonuniform magnetic field may undergo pontecorvo transition to a @xmath57-conjugated state of the same flavor , as it was shown in @xcite . in this communication",
    "we have pointed out that this process may mediate a neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the difference between this and previously discussed channels , like the mass mechanism , pion mechanism , sparticle mediation and others , is that a resonancelike dependence on the frequency of the external magnetic field exists .",
    "thus , in principle , it may be possible to enhance the rate of the @xmath0 decay by controlling the field .",
    "one should notice that when the resonance condition is met , the propagator of a certain neutrino mass eigenstate is boosted .",
    "this means that also the usual mass mechanism of the @xmath0 decay should also be enhanced .",
    "being a higher order process , the magnetic moment channel seems to be subdominant to the mass channel .",
    "however , one can also tune the magnetic field to resonantly enhance the propagation of the antineutrino mass eigenstate . in this case",
    "the magnetic moment channel should dominate all others .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this problem will appear in an upcoming paper . at present",
    ", we are not aware of any experimental possibilities to discriminate between these two cases .    we have discussed a simplified two - neutrino case in which the third mass eigenstate is decoupled from the electron neutrino .",
    "a full discussion of the realistic three - neutrino case together with a more thorough numerical analysis will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
