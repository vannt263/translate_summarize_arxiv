    "brane - world models play a prominent role on high energy physics , inspired in string theory advances .",

    "although the einstein - hilbert action can be replaced by an arbitrary function @xmath1 of the 4d ricci scalar @xmath2 @xcite , a randall - sundrum type model with @xmath0(r ) as the action in bulk space is still incipient in the literature @xcite ( hereon we denote by r the 5d ricci scalar ) . moreover , recently the 5d @xmath0(r ) theories of gravity have been studied @xcite to address the dark matter problem , whereas a @xmath0(r ) model of gravity with curvature - matter coupling in a 5d bulk was established in @xcite .",

    "our aim is to study these models , encompassing @xmath0(r ) bulk effects , and probe black holes derived in such a context , by using the classical tests .",
    "in fact , the field equations on the brane have been recently solved , obtaining a topological brane - world black hole from a 5d @xmath3 action @xcite .",
    "theories that take into account 4d @xmath1 effects are natural scenarios that unify and explain both the inflationary paradigm and the dark energy problem .",
    "hence , it is natural to go beyond and consider both the brane - world model and the modified gravity likewise .",
    "brane - world models may explain the current acceleration of our universe , while the 4d @xmath1 theories can either apply to the early universe inflation or late time acceleration , depending on specific forms chosen .",

    "since @xmath4 appears in the metric of topologically charged @xmath0(r ) brane - world black holes , we aim to study it by the classical tests of gr .",

    "moreover , since the topologically charged brane - world black hole in ( [ nu ] ) presents a term containing @xmath146 , its upper limit of @xmath143 m@xmath144 further provides an important constraint on the black hole geometry .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that eq.([lq ] ) further constrains the trace @xmath147 , that arises when the shiromizu - maeda - sasaki procedure is applied to a @xmath0(r ) bulk .",
    "although in 4d the effect of the term @xmath148 is negligible and non observable unless the coefficient of this term is larger than @xmath149 , the effect of higher dimensional terms is suppressed by powers of the planck mass .",
    "the bounds on the coefficient of @xmath148 in 5d are still unknown and can be addressed , being out of the scope of our results here .",
