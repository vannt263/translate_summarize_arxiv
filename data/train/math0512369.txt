    "compositions can be used to encode descent classes of ordinary permutations in the following way . recall that a _ descent _ of a permutation @xmath67 is a position @xmath9 such that @xmath68 , and that an _ increasing run _ ( of length @xmath69 ) of a permutation @xmath70 is a maximal subword of consecutive letters @xmath71 such that @xmath72 . by maximality , we have that if @xmath71 is an increasing run , then @xmath9 is a descent of @xmath70 ( if @xmath73 ) , and @xmath74 is a descent of @xmath70 ( if @xmath75 ) . for any permutation @xmath67 define the _ descent composition _ , @xmath76 , to be the ordered tuple listing from left to right the lengths of the increasing runs of @xmath70 . if @xmath77 , we can recover the descent set of @xmath70 : @xmath78 for example , the permutation @xmath79 has @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "the different urns represent the parts of the composition , the number of balls in an urn is the size of that part , and the color of the balls is the color of the part . here",
    "we ignore parts of size 0 .",
    "notice that the color of a part is well defined , since none of the moves allows balls of different colors to be combined in a single urn .",
    "it is an easy exercise to check that each covering relation in @xmath61 corresponds to one of these three possible moves for some urn , and furthermore that the urn and type of move are unique .",
    "let @xmath205 $ ] be an interval in @xmath61 , @xmath206 we will now define a labeling @xmath207 for a maximal chain @xmath208 our set of labels is @xmath209 totally ordered with the lexicographic order .",

    "[ thm : shellable ] intervals in @xmath61 are dual cl - shellable and hence cohen - macaulay .",

    "that is , the mbius function of an interval is @xmath228 to the length of the interval , times the number of maximal chains with a strictly decreasing label .",
    "suppose that @xmath229 with @xmath230 then there is a unique chain with a strictly decreasing label , obtained by removing the balls from right to left using only type ( 1 ) moves . therefore @xmath231    now suppose that @xmath24 has a part @xmath9 of size 2 or greater .",

    "any chain that makes a type ( 1 ) move from the same urn twice will have a repeated label .",
    "the only way to remove the balls from urn @xmath9 and possibly have a decreasing label is to remove at most one ball with a type ( 1 ) move , and then move all the balls to an urn on the left with a type ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) move .",

    "we must have an urn with at least two balls and no way to make a type ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) move . then we must use two type ( 1 ) moves for the same urn , so the chain label can not be strictly decreasing .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath24 has parts @xmath193 and @xmath232 of size 1 and the same color . the only legal way to remove the balls from the corresponding urns is to remove the left one first , creating an increase in the chain label .",
    "note that for @xmath49 with @xmath233 there are @xmath0 choices for the color of the first part , and @xmath234 choices for the color of each succeeding part .",

    "then we use covering relations of type @xmath248 to fill in the remaining 1 s of different colors .",
    "therefore @xmath241 is obtained via rank selection from the interval @xmath249,$ ] so shellability follows by results of @xcite .    for the mbius",
    "function :    @xmath250    [ rem:1 ] bjrner and stanley show that @xmath251 is isomorphic to the subword order on 2 letters .",
    "this allows the transfer of many results , such as cl - shellability and the mbius function of an arbitrary interval .",
    "since there are @xmath252 colored compositions of @xmath253 one might expect that @xmath61 is isomorphic to the subword order on @xmath254 letters , with a restriction on the first or last letter of a word .",
    "however , this turns out to be false . for example , consider the colored composition @xmath255 , which is present in @xmath61 for all @xmath256 .",
    "it covers 4 colored compositions : @xmath257 , but a word of length 3 can cover at most 3 subwords .",

    "the lexicographically first label is well defined , since all the moves from a given distribution of balls in urns have distinct labels .",
    "moreover , we can describe the lexicographically first chain , @xmath221 , as follows . if @xmath262 then at each step , to move down from @xmath211 to @xmath263 , we must remove a ball from an urn as far to the left as possible , such that the new composition is still in the interval @xmath215 $ ] . to prove that @xmath264",
    ", we use the following lemma .      on an interval of length two",
    ", all chains correspond to removing two balls from urns , such that the starting and ending distributions are the same . for the chain @xmath221 with the lexicographically first label , the urns are consecutively chosen to be as far to the left as",

    "suppose that @xmath269 so there is no urn between @xmath192 and @xmath265 removing a ball from @xmath192 does not affect the possibility of removing a ball from @xmath270 unless @xmath271 and @xmath272 in this case , the urns could have been chosen to be @xmath195 and @xmath273 for an appropriate urn @xmath195 with @xmath274 making a type ( 1 ) or type ( 3 ) move in @xmath195 and then a type ( 2 ) move in urn @xmath201 however , this contradicts our assumption that @xmath192 was chosen to be the leftmost possible .",
