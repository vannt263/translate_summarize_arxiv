    "dust and gas disks surround stars of different ages , from pre - main sequence to post - main sequence stars .",
    "because their evolution is intimately connected with the process of planet formation , studies of dust amount , size spectrum , mineralogy , and spatial distribution in disks can provide valuable information about the crucial stages of planet formation .",
    "the amount of dust in disks generally decreases with time ( zuckerman & becklin 1993 ; natta , grinin , & mannings 2000 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the fraction of detectable , optically thick disks ( at @xmath33 au from the star ) , decreases from nearly 100% at the estimated object age @xmath20.3 myr down to a few percent at the age of @xmath210 myr ( hillenbrand & meyer 1999 ; meyer & beckwith 2000 ) . the amount of gas decreases as well ( zuckerman , foreville , & kastner 1995 ; liseau & artymowicz 1998 ) , especially abruptly at an age of several to @xmath210 myr for solar - type stars , when circumstellar disks lose most of the primordial protostellar / protoplanetary material through processes such as viscous accretion and photoionization , as discussed by hollenbach et al .  ( 2000 ) . from the original value of close to 100 , the gas - to - solids ( if not necessarily gas - to - dust ) mass ratio in the t tauri and herbig ae / be stars decreases during this period ( i.e. , typically at age 310 myr ) to much smaller values , eventually much less than unity , thus leaving a predominantly dusty remnant disk .",
    "vega - type stars , observable owing to their large thermal infrared ( ir ) excess over the extrapolated ir stellar photospheric radiation , and sometimes resolved in scattered visible / near - ir starlight , are thought to contain such gas - poor disks .",
    "the prime example of an object of this kind is @xmath4 pic , which is 20100 myr old , and has a large disk ( @xmath510@xmath6 au radius ) containing gas and dust , apparently in a ratio smaller than unity ( artymowicz 1997 ; liseau & artymowicz 1998 ) . based on dust destruction timescale in vega - type disks ,",
    "the disks are thought ( or sometimes defined ) to be continuously replenished by the collisions and evaporation of planetesimals .",
    "most convincingly in @xmath7 pic , but also in a few younger , spectroscopically variable herbig ae stars , the existence of planetesimals and planetary objects necessary to perturb planetesimal orbits , has been inferred from spectroscopy ( lagrange , backman , & artymowicz 2000 ; grady et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the disks around stars with ages between 3 and 10 myr are particularly interesting , because of the expected presence of protoplanets , growing by collisional accumulation of planetesimals and through gas accretion ( hayashi , nakazawa , & nakagawa 1985 ; lissauer 1993 ) .",
    "we shall call such disks transitional , in reference to a transition from a relatively high - mass , optically thick primordial nebulae to low - mass , optically thin dust disks .",
    "( other names , related to the central star , are used for the objects in which such disks reside : young main sequence stars , or old pre - main sequence stars ; cf .",
    "lagrange et al.2000 . )",
    "recent imaging of two apparently transitional disks , hr 4796a and hd 141569a , provided interesting insight into the spatial distribution of dust .",
    "the a0 v star hr 4796a with age @xmath8 myr ( stauffer , hartmann , & barrado y navascues 1995 ) has been imaged , first in mid - ir and afterwards in near - ir ( jayawardhana 1998 ; koerner et al . 1998 ; schneider et al .",
    "1999 ; telesco et al .",
    "the second object , b9.5 ve star hd 141569a , is 210 myr old .",
    "near - ir images of its dust disk were obtained by weinberger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and augereau et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , while the thermal mid - ir flux was mapped by fisher et al .",
    "the disk in the image of hr 4796a extends out to about 100 au , a distance 4 times smaller than in hd 141569a , and is significantly narrower than its counterpart ( of order 20 au , vs.  200 au ) .",
    "the two systems have , however , very similar dust covering factor , or the ratio of total ir dust luminosity to the stellar luminosity , @xmath9 , equal to 0.7% in hr 4796a , and 1% in hd 141569a , which are a factor of 3 to 4 times larger than in @xmath4 pic .",
    "both disks show structure , which can be modeled as axisymmetric , broad rings with inner holes ( near side - far side asymmetry of surface brightness by a factor of 1.5 or less , has been interpreted as being due to an oblique viewing angle combined with anisotropic scattering by dust . )",
    "the radii of the inner holes are @xmath10 au for hr 4796a ( koerner et al .",
    "1998 ; schneider et al . 1999 ) and @xmath11 au for hd 141569a ( augereau et al . 1999a ; weinberger et al .",
    "the image of hd 141569a taken at @xmath12 by weinberger et al .",
    "( 1999 ) has been analyzed to reveal a double ring , or ring - gap - ring morphology with the shallow gap ( or dip ) in the surface brightness , centered on the projected distance @xmath13 au .",
    "the two maxima are found at 200 and 350 au .",
    "noteworthy , the same system observed at @xmath14 by augereau et al .",
    "( 1999a ) shows only one broad ring peaking in brightness at @xmath15 au .",
    "it is not clear to what extent the apparent differences in the inferred surface brightness are due to the peculiarities of observational techniques , such as the different time lag between the registration of object and comparison star ( point - spread function ) , and to what extent by intrinsic factors like , e.g. , the possible wavelength - dependent scattering efficiency of dust around hd 141569a .",
    "for example , if the inner peak of hd 141569a is dominated by small grains , then it would rayleigh - scatter 4.5 times better at @xmath12 than at @xmath14 .",
    "recently , hd 163296 , a herbig ae star , was announced by grady et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to have a disk - and - gap morphology similar to that of hd 141569a .",
    "disks around vega - type stars , which are more evolved than the transitional disks discussed above , also have inner holes or clearing regions , mostly but not always completely devoid of dust ( for review see lagrange et al .",
    "mid - ir images of the @xmath4 pic disk show the central low - density hole ( lagage & pantin 1994 ; pantin , lagage , & artymowicz 1997 ) and submillimeter images of fomalhaut and @xmath16 eridani show the ring - like structure of dust disks ( holland et al .",
    "1998 ; greaves et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it is expected that the gravity of embedded large bodies , such as planets or brown dwarfs , form such inner holes in the dust distributions ( roques et al .",
    "1994 ; liou & zook 1999 ) .    the inner holes of the transitional disks around hr 4796a and hd 141569a may also be produced by planetary bodies embedded in the disks ( or rather , in these holes ) . moreover ,",
    "planetary influences creating the disk `` gap '' at 325 au from hd 141569a ( and a similar distance from hd 163296 ) have been proposed as an explanation of these striking features .",
    "weinberger et al . ( 1999 ) estimate that a 1.3 jupiter mass perturber would open a gap with the observed extent .",
    "grady et al . ( 1999 ) conclude that their observations lend strong support for early formation of massive planets at distances as large as @xmath17 au from the stars .",
    "however , there are several potential difficulties with the proposal that giant planets form routinely at such large distances in disks , in only a few myr .",
    "notice that the circular orbit of a planet , required by the circularity of a narrow  gap \" , would imply a local formation history of the hypothetical planet .",
    "formation in the inner disk and ejection to a large distance by , e.g. , planet - planet perturbations would not provide a nearly circular orbit required .",
    "admittedly , radial migration of planets via interaction with the disk may also occur but an _ outward _ migration distance is always moderate .",
    "standard theory of planet formation requires a high surface density of solids for giant planet formation at large radii . for example , the numerical simulations of planetesimal accretion at 70 au by kenyon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the pluto - sized planets ( but not the required multi - earth mass planets ) may form in 10 myr only if the mass of the disk is as large as @xmath18 times the minimum solar nebula mass ( @xmath19 ) , a mass about 10 times larger than the typical masses of disks around t tauri stars ( osterloh & beckwith 1995 ) .",
    "the amount of gas on the outskirts of a typical t tauri disk , at the age of @xmath201 myr , is probably also insufficient for other modes of giant planet formation , such as the disk fragmentation , although such a possibility in principle exists .",
    "one argument against it , however , is apparent in the hd 141569a system , where the surface brightness profile does not show any deep depletion of dust ( an empty gap ) such as those which quickly appear around a giant planet in hydrodynamical models ( e.g. , lubow , seibert , & artymowicz 1999 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the `` gap '' is merely a 14% dip in the surface density of dust , as compared with neighboring disk regions .",
    "weinberger et al . ( 1999 ) thus propose a very recent timing for the formation of their proposed jovian perturber .",
    "troublesome as it is for any formation scenario , this special timing requirement seems particularly incompatible with the early disk fragmentation scenarios .    motivated by the apparent axisymmetry or near - axisymmetry of the observed ring and gap structures in disks ,",
    "we devote this paper to the exploratory study of an alternative mechanism for the appearance of a variety of possible dust morphologies including outer dust rings and apparent disk gaps , connected with the phenomenon of radial migration of dust in gas disks .",
    "in the context of transitional disks , which are optically thin to the stellar visible and near - uv radiation and have gas component with moderate mass , we consider two important effects : radiation pressure from the central star and gas drag . as we will show , the combination of radiation and drag forces results in an _",
    "outward _ direction of migration for the observable dust and strongly affects the observed disk morphology , while preserving the usual inward direction of migration of sand and pebbles .",
    "it is easy to see why transitional disks support the most vigorous migration .",
    "primordial protoplanetary nebulae are both optically thick and so dense ( gas : dust mass ratio @xmath21 ) that most dust grains  freeze \" in gas , and are not able to migrate through the gas .",
    "vega - type stars , on the other hand , are dust dominated ( lagrange et al . 2000 ) .",
    "they generally contain so little gas ( gas : dust @xmath22 ) that the motion of dust is weakly affected in the grain s lifetime .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "hr 4796a and hd 141569a may have gas disks comparable with or somewhat more massive than the dust disks .",
    "zuckerman et al . (",
    "1995 ) have found co line emission from the gas inside 130 au distance from hd 141569a .",
    "a double h@xmath23 line from the gas disk in the immediate vicinity of the star ( dunkin , barlow , & ryan 1997 ) also demonstrates the existence of an extended gas disk , required for sustained accretion of gas . whether this gas is a remnant of primordial gaseous nebula or a secondary gas released by solids ( for instance , evaporating planetesimals ) ,",
    "is not known at present . in any case",
    ", transitional disks may have substantial amounts of gas ( many earth masses ) , even if an unfavorable viewing geometry of most systems precludes a spectroscopic detection of the circumstellar absorption lines .",
    "artymowicz ( 2000 ) argues that gas must be present and gas drag must be operative in the transitional disks , or else the radiation pressure - boosted destruction rate of solids would be prohibitively large .",
    "one feature of our model , which may be observable , is the radial fractionation of dust according to grain size .",
    "the most important feature is that at the outer edge of the gas disk , dust forms a ring without the help of any shepherding bodies .",
    "therefore , the ring structure of the dust disk does not necessarily indicate the existence of planets or brown dwarfs .",
    "klahr & lin ( 2000 ) also proposed a model for the ring formation due to the dust migration . whether or not these models can quantitatively reproduce all the observational data is , of course , a matter of detailed modeling , taking into account each system s scale , central star s properties , indications of dust mineralogy from spectroscopy etc .",
    "we defer such detailed modeling of transitional disks to a later publication , but provide qualitative discussions in  7 .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that our model is testable against the existing observations , and can suggest new observations . excluding dust migration as a cause of the observed disk structure might , in fact , be as important as finding that it matches the observations of a given object , since such an exclusion would very strongly support the hypothesis of dynamical sculpting by planets .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe the equations of the dust grain motion . in  3 , we derive approximate expressions of radial velocity of grains .",
    "we show both inward and outward migrations of grains occur due to the combined effect of radiation pressure and gas drag forces . in  4 , we show that grains segregate in the gas disk according to their sizes and that grains of medium size ( @xmath24 in our models ) concentrate at the edge of the gas disk . in  5 , the orbital evolution of grains is calculated numerically .",
    "we discuss the excitation of eccentricities of grain orbits at the edge of the gas disk . in  6 , we calculate the lifetime of grains by taking into account the collisional destruction of grains .",
    "we derive the density structure of the dust disk and discuss the formation of an outer dust ring . in  7 , we show a sample image in near- and mid - ir from our simple model . finally , ",
    "8 discusses the relevance of the migration - induced dust structures to observed systems , and compare them with dust features of other origin .",
    "we consider the motion of dust grains in a gas disk .",
    "the equation of motion of a dust grain with mass @xmath25 and the position vector @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance of the grain from the central star , @xmath29 is the unit vector directed to the grain , @xmath30 is the gravitational constant , @xmath31 is the central star s mass , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the radiation pressure , poynting - robertson drag ( pr drag ) , and gas drag force , respectively .    the radiation pressure force @xmath32 is expressed using the ratio of radiation pressure force to the gravitational force @xmath4 , @xmath35 the ratio @xmath36 is written as ( burns , lamy , & soter 1979 ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the central star s luminosity , @xmath39 is the speed of light , @xmath40 is the grain s radius , @xmath41 is the material density of the grain , and @xmath42 is the radiation pressure coefficient averaged over the stellar spectrum .",
    "the values of @xmath4 are calculated using mie theory ( artymowicz 1988 ) and shown in figure 1 .",
    "the grains are assumed to consist of silicates .",
    "we use the laboratory measurements of optical constants of olivine ( mgfesio@xmath43 ) and magnesium - rich pyroxene ( mg@xmath44fe@xmath45sio@xmath46 ) by dorschner et al .",
    "the grains are modeled as porous , containing 50% volume fraction of vacuum ( the volume fractions of the two silicates being 25% each ) .",
    "the density of composite grains is then @xmath47 . for the central stars ,",
    "we used parameters of hr 4796a ( solid line ) and hd 141569a ( dashed line ) , and the renormalized spectrum of a0 v type star vega . the mass and luminosity of hr 4796a are @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ( jura et al . 1993 ; jura et al .",
    "1998 ) , while for hd 141569a these parameters are @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( van den ancker et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the pr drag force @xmath33 is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the velocity vector of the grain , and @xmath54 is the velocity component in the @xmath29 direction ( burns et al .",
    "1979 ) .",
    "if the velocities of the grain ( @xmath53 ) and the gas ( @xmath55 ) differ , the grain experiences a gas drag force @xmath34 .",
    "the sizes of grains considered in this paper are much smaller than the mean free path of the gas molecules .",
    "thus , if the velocity difference @xmath56 is much smaller than the mean thermal velocity of gas , the gas drag force is given by the epstein drag law @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gas density and @xmath59 is 4/3 times the mean thermal velocity . for the gas with mean molecular weight @xmath60 and temperature @xmath61 , @xmath59 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath64 is the mass of the hydrogen atom . in the case of @xmath65 ,",
    "the gas drag force is @xmath66 a standard way to connect these two regimes is ( kwok 1975 ) @xmath67    the stopping time by the gas drag force is defined as @xmath68 .",
    "it can be made non - dimensional by writing @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "the non - dimensional stopping time can then be expressed as @xmath71 where the square root factor represents the supersonic correction .",
    "the subsonic stopping time parameter equals @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the keplerian velocity . when @xmath74 , particles move slowly through the gas and couple to it in one dynamical time scale .",
    "such particles are said to be marginally coupled to gas via gas drag , as opposed to the @xmath75 case , representing large grains , decoupled from the gas disk .",
    "notice that to within a factor close to unity @xmath76 equals the gas surface density @xmath77 in a disk .",
    "this allows us to express @xmath78 as @xmath79 , the inverse ratio of @xmath77 and a `` surface density of one solid particle '' , @xmath80 ( mass / cross - sectional area for a spherical particle ) .",
    "for example , a hypothetical uniform surface density gas disk with radius @xmath81 au and total mass @xmath82 , or 10 earth masses , would have @xmath83 g/@xmath84 , the same as the @xmath85 of an @xmath86 m particle with density @xmath87 g @xmath88 .",
    "all the dust grains smaller than about 51 @xmath89 m would then be well coupled to gas in such a disk , while all sand grains would have stopping times longer than one orbital period .",
    "the velocity of gas @xmath90 can be written using the keplerian velocity @xmath91 as @xmath92 quantity @xmath93 is the ratio of the pressure gradient force to the gravitational force , equal to @xmath94 where @xmath28 is the distance from the central star , and @xmath95 is the gas pressure .",
    "if gas pressure decreases with radius , which normally happens everywhere in the disk except at the inner disk edge , @xmath96 and the gas orbital motion is slightly sub - keplerian , that is slower than @xmath91 .    in this paper , we consider the dust particles near the mid - plane of the gas disk , where we introduce cylindrical coordinates @xmath97 , and neglect the fact that the grains might have finite orbital inclinations .",
    "this is equivalent to considering the vertical motions to be averaged out by vertical integration over an ensemble of particles in a short column above and below the point @xmath97 .",
    "this approach is justified by the generally weak coupling of vertical and planar motions of a grain in a thin disk .",
    "the equations of motion of a dust grain at @xmath98 with velocity @xmath99 are @xmath100 - \\frac{v_{\\rm k } v_r}{t_{\\rm s } r } \\ , \\label{eq : motion_r}\\ ] ] @xmath101 where @xmath102 given by equation ( [ eq : ts ] ) depends on the velocity of the grain .",
    "small solid bodies migrate in disks with a speed depending on their size , radiative support and gas drag .",
    "if the radiation pressure exceeds central star s gravity ( @xmath103 ) , then the grains ( called @xmath4-meteoroids ) are blown away on a dynamical time scale , unless strongly braked by friction against gas .",
    "we do not concern ourselves with the observability of rapidly escaping @xmath4-meteoroids in this paper .",
    "( we do take into account their collisions with stable disk particles , however . ) in this section , we consider grains that have nearly circular orbits and spiral in ( or out ) because of the drag forces .",
    "if the angular velocities of grains are larger than that of gas , the grains experience headwind and lose angular momentum to move inward .",
    "inward migration of a grain subject to gas drag , but no radiation pressure or the pr drag , was discussed by adachi , hayashi , & nakazawa ( 1976 ) and weidenschilling ( 1977 ) .",
    "exposure of dust grains to the radiation pressure often causes the orbital speed of grains to be slower than that of gas . in this case which we study below",

    "if the motions of grains and gas are close to the keplerian circular motion , we can derive approximate formulae connecting the two regimes of weak and strong coupling of grains with gas .",
    "solutions of this kind , clarifying the size - dependent nature of migration , were presented for the classical inward migration of grains in optically thick disks by adachi et al .",

    "the ring structure at the edge of the gas disk would be less prominent , because some of grains making the ring would be destroyed before arriving at their steady orbit . to obtain the structure of the dust disk , the calculation taking into account the destruction of grains on the way to the steady orbit must be needed .",

    "the value of the efficiency of collisional destruction @xmath272 is uncertain ( eq . [ [ eq : effdest ] ] ) .",

    "although the gas masses derived by our models are consistent with the observations , we must note that any exact match could be accidental .",
    "our models have large uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the efficiency of the collisional destruction @xmath272 has an order of magnitude of uncertainty ( eq . [ [ eq : effdest ] ] ) . if @xmath272 of the actual grains were larger / smaller than the value we adopted ( @xmath378 ) , then the grains would be more / less easily destroyed and the mass and luminosity of dust in a given gas disk would be lower / higher .      in figure 10 , we present the theoretical image of model 4 ( constant gas surface density ) , inclined to the line of sight by 60@xmath379 from pole - on , in the near - ir scattered light ( gray - scale brightness map at 1.1 @xmath380 wavelength ) , and the mid - ir thermal radiation ( over - plotted contours of the 18.2 @xmath380 flux ) .",
    "our modeling is somewhat simplistic , in that the scattering function is assumed to be isotropic ( which does not alter the general morphology , just removes any up - down asymmetry of the theoretical image ) .",
    "however , the temperature profile as a function of radius needs to be computed as accurately as possible for a reliable prediction of thermal ir flux distribution , so we compute it within mie theory , from the assumed properties of grains ( specified earlier in  2 ) .",
    "the dust morphology in the model is qualitatively similar to those inferred from observations of the transitional system hd 141569a .",
    "the @xmath381 flux is centrally concentrated ( like that imaged by fisher et al .",
    "2000 ) , while the scattered light shows two separate components : the inner disk and the outer ring , with the brightest parts being the two projection - enhanced ansae .",
    "if these two components are largely overlapping , they may create the impression of a shallow gap , resembling qualitatively the image at @xmath382 by weinberger et al .",

    "comparison with the observations suggests that gas is not concentrated in the inner part of the disk .",
    "the flat profile of gas surface density might arise after the viscous evolution .    in order to achieve a quantitative agreement of our models with the observations of hd 141569a , we would need to : ( i ) consider non - isotropic scattering function , ( ii ) allow for a more gradual outer gas truncation , and ( iii ) convolve the theoretical images with the appropriate point - spread functions .",
    "as already mentioned , we defer the comprehensive modeling of individual objects to a subsequent paper .",
    "another system which might be qualitatively described by our dust migration models ,",
    "hr 4796a , shows an enhanced - brightness ansae of the dust ring in scattered light ( schneider et al .",
    "1999 ) , similar to our model in figure 10 .",
    "the @xmath381 images also indicate a ring - like morphology ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "1998 ; koerner et al . 1998 ; telesco et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in other words , the dust ring with characteristic radius of 70 au , producing the scattered light , also produces most of the @xmath381 thermal radiation .",
    "our thermal mid - ir map shows a more centrally concentrated morphology , therefore our modeling procedure needs to be argued in order to fit the observations .",
    "two possibilities exist .",
    "first , our model image represents the emission from dust in steady circular orbits , and omit the possible contribution by other particles , those flowing out on spiral orbits due to @xmath103 , and the ones pumped up to high eccentricity at the edge of the disk ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "the combined area of such dust grains is small , but they could in principle be seen because of the small physical sizes , and the associated higher temperatures ( see fig . 4 in augereau et al .",
    "1999b and fig . 5 in wyatt et al .",
    "we note that the thermal emission in mid - ir ( the planck function in wien regime ) and thus the visibility of grains in the outer ring is often very sensitive to the dust grain temperature ; it is not uncommon to find that the predicted @xmath381 flux from the ring becomes 6 times under just @xmath220% increase in dust temperature ( from 70k to 84k ) , which could make the model ring visible .",
    "another way to assure a quantitative fit to hr 4796a data is a modification of the modeled gas profile , which depletes the gas inside the ring radius .",
    "our model would then produce a more sharply defined ring and less dust inside the ring , because , at the region where gas is depleted , collisional disruption of dust grains is violent .",
    "this depletion of gas ( and dust ) might in this case be due to one or more planets or a low - mass companion inside about a half of the ring radius ( @xmath384au ) .",
    "\\1 . grains can migrate inward or outward , depending on whether its azimuthal motion is faster or slower than the rotation velocity of gas .",
    "even grains smaller than the blow - out radius ( @xmath103 ) have spiral trajectories in gas disks .    \\2 .",
    "we have provided analytical formulae for the radial migration speed in  3 , which agree with the detailed numerical integrations .",
    "the radial migration speed depends on gas density , but could be large . for grain sizes @xmath208 in disks around a - type stars of radius comparable with 100 au and masses of order @xmath385 earth masses it reaches a significant fraction of gas sound speed .",
    "the radius of the steady orbit depends on the grain size . that dependence is given by the rotation curve of the gas disk , depending on the radial gas distribution .",
    "smaller grains normally find a steady orbit farther from the central star .",
    "this results in the fractionation of grains according to their sizes .",
    "the eccentricity of a grain is strongly damped through out most of the disk , but is excited and maintained at a value up to @xmath386 at the edge of the gas disk , where the gas density falls rapidly ( e.g. , as a steep power law or exponentially ) .",
    "the rule number 3 above applies then , not to the whole orbit , but to the vicinity of the pericenter of the orbit .",
    "we have studied gas disk models which have density varying as a power law , truncated within an adjustable scale length , always preserving the rayleigh stability of the disk , and a total mass from a fraction to dozens of earth masses .",
    "the outcome of grain migration depends on the radiation pressure coefficient @xmath4 and the grain size .",
    "the approximate ranges of grain radii are cited below for @xmath387 based on our physical model of grains as moderately porous mixture of olivines and pyroxenes , and for the luminosity to mass ratio of the star equal 8.4 , as appropriate for hr 4796a and approximately also for hd 141569a . ] . the fine dust fraction ( @xmath388 ; @xmath389 )",
    "is removed by strong radiation pressure .",
    "dust grains with @xmath390 , or alternatively @xmath391 , form an extended , outer dust disk component , residing most of the time beyond the bulk of the gas disk on eccentric orbits .",
    "grains of intermediate size ( @xmath392 or @xmath393 ) concentrate near the outer edge of the gas disk , forming a prominent dust ring of width similar to the scale length of gas density cutoff . sand grains and meteoroids ( @xmath394 or @xmath395 )",
    "stay in the inner part of the gas disk .",
    "we considered collisions between each grain size fraction .",
    "the steady orbits can be called parking orbits at best .",
    "after one collisional time ( which is typically much longer than the migration time , but much shorter than the age of the system ) the grains are fragmented or eroded , jumping into a smaller grain fraction and moving to a new parking orbit or out into the interstellar space .",
    "the grains are continuously replenished , in our models from the inner part of the disk at radii of order 10 au , although a wider distribution of sources and/or somewhat different size distribution produced by dust source are certainly thinkable . as a result , the disk reaches a stable dust density ( and size ) distribution . including those particles which occupy the long - lived parking orbits , we predicted the dust distribution in several model disks .",
    "the results show an outer ring of small dust and , in addition , an inner disk of large dust and sand .",
    "these results are somewhat sensitive to the mechanical properties of the particles , such as strength against catastrophic fragmentation and erosion coefficient .",
    "in contrast , the dust density in figure 9 does not depend on the dust production rate in the disk .",
    "a variety of dust morphologies can be obtained in our models with deliberately smooth ( monotonic ) gas distributions , depending on how wide and dense the outer ring is , relative to the main disk .",
    "for instance , there might exist systems with ring morphology , ring plus inner disk morphology ( possibly giving impression of disks with gaps ) , and disks with weak / unobservable rings . since it is straitforward to obtain a ring several times denser than the adjacent disk region , such rings should be observable in scattered light imaging .",
    "somewhat more model - dependent is the observability of radial structure in thermal ir maps , since those depend strongly on the profile of dust temperature as a function of radius .",
    "we have qualitatively compared our models with two observed transitional disks , around hr 4796a and hd 141569a ( by transitional we mean object intermediate between the gas - rich primordial nebulae and late - stage , replenished dust disks of @xmath4 pic and vega - type ; cf .",
    "the discussion of this notion in the introduction ) .",
    "we found a qualitative agreement with most of the observed characteristics of these disks , and sketched in  7.2 several possible improvements to the modeling procedure , which could be used in detailed model fitting .",
    "in general , our results open the prospect for diagnosing the state of the gas component of circumstellar disks by observing the dust and calculating the dust - gas coupling .",
    "the structure of the dust disk strongly depends on the properties of the gas disk .",
    "the most obvious example may be the existence , radius and width of the outer `` edge '' or downturn of the gas disk , reflected in the corresponding parameters of the dust ring ( of course , what we call a `` ring '' may well be in - out asymmetric , and thus prompt a description as a truncated disk ) . therefore , if our model assumptions are satisfied , the dust component of an observed disk carries valuable information about the gas component , which is often more difficult or impossible to study directly . for example , unlike in hd 141569a , where the hydrogen and co gas is at least directly detected if not mapped in detail , in the hr 4796a disk we only know the upper limits on gas contents .",
    "[ [ origin-of-structure-in-disks-dust-migration-vs.extrasolar-planets ] ] origin of structure in disks : dust migration vs.  extrasolar planets ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    our results also bear on the timely issue of planet detection in extrasolar systems .",
    "radial and azimuthal structure can be induced in circumstellar disks by the gravitational perturbation ( also known as sculpting ) due to planets or other substellar companions in or in the vicinity of disks ( cf .",
    "dermott et al .",
    "1994 , liou & zook 1999 , wyatt et al .",
    "1999 , and ozernoy et al .",
    "2000 , for gas - free disks and , e.g. , lubow et al .",
    "1999 for gas disks ) .",
    "detection of such structure is one of the main diagnostic tools in many of the future imaging projects at various wavelengths , including the ambitious space interferometry missions .",
    "however , caution should be exercised while interpreting disk morphology .",
    "there are many possible reasons unrelated to dynamical perturbations which could , in principle , masquerade as planets ( artymowicz 2000 ) .",
    "first , optically thick disks with radius - dependent thickness might cast shadows on parts of themselves .",
    "next example would be a recent collision of planetesimals in disk . though the cloud of dust released in such a collision would not be observable",
    ", it might become observable if exponentially amplified in the so - called dust avalanche ( artymowicz 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "this requires the optical thickness in the disk mid - plane larger than that in the @xmath4 pic disk ( transitional disks satisfy this requirement , as a rule ) . while admittedly rare and improbable , such a collision might produce dense patches or sectors in a disk , which are non - axisymmetric and time - dependent on orbital timescale , features similar to those offered by dynamical sculpting .",
    "another example is the dust migration , potentially much more common , but fortunately easier to distinguish from planetary influences .",
    "dust migration is capable of sculpting the disks , with an important difference from dynamical sculpting that it can not itself produce non - axisymmetry ( nor , presumably , any observable time variability ) .",
    "it can , however , provide an alternative explanation of some observed features , especially the radially structured dust disks , rings , and apparent gaps in disks .",
    "by carefully analyzing the axisymmetry ( or lack thereof ) of the underlying dust distribution , taking properly into account the asymmetry of the image due to the non - isotropic scattering function of a collection of dust grains , the observers will be able to decide whether or not our intrinsically axisymmetric models apply to any observed system .",
    "if axisymmetric model reproduce the observations , to within the uncertainties of the latter , and the inferred gas amount does not clash with any observational constraints , then the dust migration hypothesis is preferred over the planetary hypothesis by the virtue of being more natural ( conservative ) .",
    "this is especially true in systems where gas has been independently detected .",
    "it appears that a convincing planet detection by way of dust imaging should include not just a non - axisymmetric ( and time - dependent ) structure in the disk , but a very specific one , closely following the predictions of numerical simulations of either gas - free or gas - rich disks .",
