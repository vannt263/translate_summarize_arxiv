    "a precise knowledge of the @xmath0 scattering amplitude has become increasingly important since it provides crucial tests for one and two loop chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , as well as crucial information on three topics under intensive experimental and theoretical investigation : light meson spectroscopy , pionic atom decays and cp violation in kaons .",
    "unfortunately , these precision studies are very cumbersome due to the poor quality of the data which is affected by large systematic errors . here",
    "we review our recent work where we checked the fulfillment of dispersion relations by different sets of data commonly used in the literature , and provided parametrizations consistent with such requirements .",
    "recently , ananthanarayan , colangelo , gasser and leutwyler ( acgl)@xcite and colangelo , gasser and leutwyler ( cgl)@xcite have used data , analyticity and unitarity through roy equations , and chpt , to build a @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "they provide phase shifts up to @xmath1 , scattering lengths and effective ranges claiming an outstanding precision .",
    "while the methods of cgl constitute a substantial improvement over previous ones , their analysis has to rely on some input , part of which we have recently questioned .",
    "first of all , their regge high energy representation does not describe the high energy data , and does not satisfy well certain sum rules .",
    "second , their d2 wave is incompatible with a number of requirements .",
    "finally some of their input has remarkably small errors and relies precisely on some data sets that do not satisfy well forward dispersion relations .",
    "all this is discussed in the present note , which is based our recent works @xcite .",
    "we first consider wave - by - wave _ fits to data _ for the s0 , s2 , p waves , as in @xcite , which improve our  tentative solution \" in @xcite . to fit the phase shifts , @xmath3 , we parametrize @xmath4 taking into account its analytic properties , as well as its zeros ( associated with resonances ) and poles ( when the phase shift crosses @xmath5 , @xmath6integer ) .    for the p wave ,",
    "up to @xmath7gev we use the results from a fit to the pion form factor as given in @xcite .",
    "the comparison with @xmath0 scattering data can be seen in fig.1 .",
    "we take @xmath8 as the point at which inelasticity begins to be nonegligible , and we write @xmath9    for the s2 wave we fit data where two like charge pions are produced:@xcite although these pions are not all on their mass shell , at least there is no problem of interference among various isospin states . at low energies",
    ", we fix the adler zero at @xmath10 and fit only the low energy data , @xmath11 ; later on we allow @xmath12 to vary .",
    "we have @xmath13    the s0 wave experimental situation is somewhat confusing , and we consider two methods of data selection . in both , we fit @xmath14 and @xmath15 decay data , in which pions are on the _ mass shell_. in the first method , called _ global fit _ , we include some points at @xmath16 , where the various experiments agree within @xmath17 .",
    "care is exercised to compose errors realistically , see details in @xcite , subsect  2.2.2 . in this case",
    "we fix the adler zero at @xmath18 and find @xmath19 this fit ( shown in fig  1.b as py ) is valid for @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 errors are strongly correlated ; uncorrelated errors are obtained if using the parameters @xmath22 with @xmath23    the other method is to fit only @xmath14 and @xmath15 data , or to add to this , individually , data from the various experimental analyses . the results can be found in table  1 .",
    "the d and f data are scanty , and have large errors . to stabilize the fits we impose the values of the scattering lengths that follow from the froissart  gribov representation .",
    "this is not circular reasoning since their froissart  gribov representation depends mostly on the s0 , s2 and p waves , and very little on the d0 , d2 , f waves themselves .",
    "we do not discuss here the d0 and f waves ( see @xcite ) as they do not present special features .    for d2",
    "we only expect important inelasticity when the @xmath25 channel opens up , so that @xmath26 .",
    "a pole term is necessary here , since we expect @xmath27 to change sign near threshold : the data @xcite give negative and small values for @xmath28 above some @xmath29 , while , from the froissart  gribov representation , it is known@xcite that the scattering length must be positive .",
    "indeed we include in the fit the value @xmath30 .",
    "in addition , the clear inflection seen in data around 1   asks for a third order conformal expansion .",
    "so we write @xmath31 and we find @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the fit , which may be found in fig  2 , returns reasonable numbers for the scattering length and for the effective range parameter , @xmath36 : @xmath37",
    "in order to test dispersion relations we also need the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at @xmath39 , that we take from a regge fit to data @xcite ( and the slightly improved rho residue of @xcite ) .",
    "we note that , in the early 1970s , when @xmath0 phase shifts were poorly known and , above all , when it was still not clear that the standard regge picture is a qcd feature , regge factorization was questioned @xcite using crossing sum rules and then - existing low energy phase shift data .",
    "this was adopted later by acgl and cgl , assuming a too large rho residue and a pomeron a _",
    "third _ of what factorization and the experimental data on the total @xmath0 cross section implies , as well as unconventional slopes .",
    "unfortunately this has been also used in subsequent roy equation analyses . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", however , standard regge factorization describes experiment @xcite and is perfectly consistent with crossing sum rules if assumed to hold above @xmath40 .    in fig  3",
    "we show our regge description of the imaginary parts of @xmath0 scattering amplitudes @xcite together with the data@xcite , compared with that used by acgl@xcite , cgl@xcite above 2 gev .    between @xmath41",
    ", these authors use the scattering amplitude reconstructed from one cern ",
    "munich phase shift analysis , and , in particular for s0 , the re - elaboration of au , morgan and pennington @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in this region the inelasticity is large and the cern  munich experiments , which only measure the _ differential _ cross section for @xmath42 are insufficient to reconstruct without ambiguity the full imaginary part .",
    "in addition , in @xcite we showed that cern ",
    "munich phases fail to pass a number of consistency tests .",
    "this is also seen clearly in fig  3 , where we plot the total cross section for @xmath43 that follows hyams et al.,@xcite , which is incompatible with other experimental data @xcite , as well as with regge factorization",

    "review our work in @xcite and conclude that , still , they consider the cgl solution consistent .",
    "they also raised the contention that our reggeistics could not be correct because it violates certain sum rules . in view of fig.3",
    "this contention is meaningless since the py cross sections are perfectly compatible with high energy ( @xmath44 ) _ experimental _ data , while the acgl ones are not . in @xcite",
    "we also checked that our representation satisfies two crossing sum rules .",
    "concerning d2 , acgl and cgl borrow an old fit in the book of martin , morgan and shaw,@xcite where only intermediate energy data were fitted .",
    "@xmath45 which fails at threshold ( it gives a negative scattering length ) and does not fit well data below 1.42  , as shown in fig  2 . above 1",
    ", this d2 phase grows quadratically with the energy , while regge theory predicts all phases to go to a multiple of @xmath46 .",
    "in particular d2 should go to zero ; see appendix  c of @xcite for details .",
    "it is true that this d2 wave is small but , given the accuracy claimed by cgl , it is certainly not negligible .",
    "in the present section we study how well the previous amplitudes obtained from fits to different sets of data satisfy forward dispersion relations .",
    "we consider three independent scattering amplitudes in @xmath47-symmetric or antisymmetric combinations , that form a complete set : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the @xmath47 channel isospin one amplitude , @xmath50 .",
    "the reason is that the two first depend only on two isospin states , and have positivity properties : their imaginary parts are sums of positive terms , thus reducing the final uncertainties .",
    "hence , for @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 in particular , for @xmath53 , which will be important for the adler zeros , we have @xmath54 for the @xmath55 channel , which does not depend on s0 : @xmath56 at the point @xmath53 , this becomes @xmath57 finally , for isospin unit exchange , which does not require subtractions , @xmath58 at threshold this is known as the olsson sum rule .",
    "depending on the method we use to fit the s0 wave we find the results in table  1 , where , we have separated on top those fits to data with a total @xmath59 for the @xmath51 and @xmath50 dispersion relations up to 0.925 gev , a fairly reasonable @xmath60 since these fits were obtained independently of the dispersive approach .    .",
    "py : our global fit , eqs.([(2.3a)],[(2.3b ) ] ) .",
    "we do not give its @xmath61 and @xmath62 uncertainties as they are strongly correlated , see eq.([(2.3b ) ] ) for the uncorrelated ones .",
    "grayer b , c , e : different solutions in grayer et al.@xcite .",
    "kaminski : @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have also studied fits to the data in tables vi , xii and viii in @xcite , to solution a in@xcite , as well as fits to the theoretical outcome in estabrooks and martin.@xcite .",
    "they all give a total @xmath63 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the acgl , cgl analyses , by the input phases for the s0 , s2 and p waves at the point , @xmath65 , where they match the solutions to the roy equations to the experimental amplitude . indeed it is dominant for their olsson sum rule calculation , which involves the @xmath50 channel .",

    "small errors could be expected from theoretical analysis including many data but the above small error was used as an _",
    "input_.    the reason to consider such an small error is that acgl consider the difference @xmath68 at 0.8 , in the hope that some of the uncertainties will cancel",

    "all numbers here stem from the _ same experiment _ , and differ only on the method of analysis .",
