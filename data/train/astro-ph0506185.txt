    "x - rays , at least in principle , present a powerful method of studying directly the accretion processes of star formation . in the case of classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) , the magnetospheric accretion paradigm posits that material is funnelled by magnetic fields onto the star from a truncated disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than through direct surface interaction with the disk itself .",
    "matter impacts the stellar surface at free - fall velocities of up to a few hundred km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the accreting material is then expected to form a shock at the stellar surface .",
    "the resulting shocked plasma temperature is of order a few million k , and it will therefore radiate predominantly in x - rays . for the ranges of mass accretion rates inferred for ctts of @xmath3-@xmath4  yr@xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the x - ray luminosities resulting from accretion should be @xmath5  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath2easily sufficient to be observed in nearby associations of t  tauri stars and regions of star formation .",
    "the above scenario of copious accretion - driven x - rays from ctts contrasts sharply with what is observed . while strong x - ray emission appears to be a ubiquitous characteristic of ctts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the source plasma temperatures are an order of magnitude higher than can be produced in accretion shocks and heating can instead be attributed to magnetic processes analogous to coronal activity in late - type main sequence and more evolved stars .",
    "accretion activity is largely revealed by strong uv - optical continuum emission , suggesting that accretion shocks are either formed too deep in the stellar atmosphere to be observed @xcite , or that infall velocities are insufficient to attain x - ray temperatures in the shock .",
    "nevertheless , two stars now stand out as probable exceptions and examples of objects whose high resolution x - ray spectra appear to be produced , at least in part , by accretion : tw  hya @xcite and bp  tau @xcite .",
    "tw  hya has a dominant plasma temperature of @xmath7  k , as expected from an accretion shock resulting from free - fall of gas from a truncated disk .",
    "based on the density - sensitive he - like ne and o lines , both tw  hya and bp  tau seem to be characterised by plasma with high electron densities @xmath8-@xmath9  @xmath10 at temperatures of @xmath11  k @xcite , in contrast to all other single and active binary stars studied in the surveys of @xcite and @xcite , where he - like o lines indicate @xmath12  @xmath10 .",
    "the x - ray spectra of both stars exhibit extremely weak lines of mg , si and fe , and instead are dominated by o and ne .",
    "while this pattern is reminiscent of that seen in very active rs  cvn - type binaries ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite echoed the earlier suggestion of @xcite that the metal depletion is instead a signature of the accretion of grain - depleted gas .",
    "if the latter is indeed the case , x - rays then provide a unique means of investigating the matter in the inner accretion disk that is in the process of accreting .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we draw on the recent findings of @xcite , based on _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) spectra of nearby stars , that the ne / o abundance ratio is remarkably constant in stellar coronae .",
    "we use this result to investigate ne / o in tw  hya and bp  tau , and show that this ratio provides a diagnostic of the depletion of o in grains in the circumstellar disk , and in particular in the very inner disk from which accreting material derives .",
    "we use spectral line fluxes for the h - like and he - like resonance lines of ne and o obtained from _ xmm - newton _ observations of tw  hya ( acquired 2001 july ) and bp  tau ( acquired 2004 august ) by @xcite and @xcite , respectively ; the reader is referred to these works for further details regarding the observations . to provide an additional tw  hya association comparison for tw  hya itself",
    ", we also analysed the same lines for the ctts twa  5 studied recently by @xcite based on _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "tw  hya was observed earlier by the _",
    "hetg and acis - s , on 2000 july 18 at ut10:19 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further details ) . here",
    ", we have analysed the products of standard ciao 3.0 processing , and in particular the medium energy grating spectrum .",
    "the measurement of ne and o line spectral line fluxes and all calculations were performed using the idl package for interactive analysis of line emission ( pintofale ) following the methods described by @xcite .",
    "the line fluxes of interest for this study are listed in table  [ t : flx ] .",
    "the conversion of ne and o fluxes into the ne / o abundance ratio by number , @xmath13 , is described by @xcite .",
    "briefly , an abundance ratio in an optically - thin , collision - dominated plasma can be derived by using lines whose contribution functions @xmath14the product of the parent ion population and the line emissivity  have very similar temperature dependence , simply from the ratio of observed line fluxes ( corrected for attenuation by interstellar extinction ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 : @xmath17 for ne and o , such a ratio of @xmath14 functions can be constructed from the o  viii , ne  ix and ne  x resonance lines @xmath18 and @xmath19 , combined as follows @xmath20 @xcite found @xmath21 for active stars .",
    "ne / o abundance ratios derived for bp  tau , tw  hya and twa  5 using this method are also listed in table  [ t : flx ] , together with the intervening absorbing columns used to correct the observed line fluxes for attenuation .",
    "these ne / o ratios are compared with those presented by @xcite for a sample of 21 post - t  tauri stars , including single main - sequence stars , giants , and tidally - interacting binaries in figure  [ f : ne_o ] .",
    "based on the ne / o ratios found for post - t  tauri stars , @xcite drew two conclusions : ( i ) ne / o is essentially constant in stellar coronae , and in full - disk observations is not susceptible to fractionation effects that often appear to characterise other elements with lower first ionisation potentials ( fips ) ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) the ne / o abundance ratio in stars is significantly larger than current assessments of the solar ratio ( also illustrated in figure  [ f : ne_o ] ) , but is in - line with inference from solar oscillations @xcite .",
    "the constancy of the coronal ne / o ratio then allows us to use these elements for diagnostics purposes .",
    "firstly , we can determine whether or not the suspected accretion shock has an ne / o ratio consistent with that of the underlying star , as represented by the constant coronal ne / o ratio illustrated in figure  [ f : ne_o ] .",
    "a ratio significantly different to the coronal value would provide further evidence that these lines are not formed in a `` normal '' coronal plasma .",
    "secondly , departures from the coronal ne / o ratio can then be used to infer compositional peculiarities in the accreting gas .",
    "we conclude from figure  [ f : ne_o ] that the ne / o ratio of @xmath22 we find in tw  hya  in good agreement with the value obtained earlier by @xcite based on a differential emission measure analysis  is significantly higher than that of more evolved stars ( figure  [ f : ne_o ] ) .",
    "in contrast , ne / o in bp  tau is perfectly consistent with that found for the rest of the sample of @xcite .",
    "this latter result also supports the interpretation of the ne / o abundance in stellar coronae as representative of the ambient local cosmos : under the assumption that the ne and o lines in bp  tau are formed from accreting material , as the anomalous o  vii line ratios analysed by @xcite suggest , the ratio seen in bp  tau indicates that its circumstellar material shares the same ne / o ratio .",
    "we can confirm that the ne / o ratio found for tw  hya does not simply a reflect an anomalous local environmental composition by comparison with the ratio seen in twa  5 , a ctts from the same association as tw  hya .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of twa  5 has been analysed recently by @xcite : unlike tw  hya and bp  tau , it does not show the high plasma density signature of an accretion shock , and its ne and o lines can be interpreted as being formed in magnetically - heated coronal plasma . using the @xcite o and ne line fluxes ( table  [ t : flx ] ) we obtain @xmath23in good agreement with their result based on a differential emission measure analysis and in excellent agreement with that of the rest of our star sample , except for tw  hya .",
    "similarly , @xcite find @xmath24 for the tw hya association multiple , non - accreting , weak - lined t tauri star system hd  98800 based on _ chandra _ hetg spectra .",
    "@xcite suggested that the lack of si in the uv spectrum of the accretion shock of tw  hya was a signature of the accretion of grain - depleted material .",
    "@xcite invoked their suggestion to explain the metal - poor x - ray spectrum .",
    "however , since tidally - interacting binaries have also been shown to exhibit similar metal paucity ( see , e.g.  reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is not immediately clear that the composition of the hot plasma in tw  hya is significantly different .",
    "the ne / o ratio provides this evidence , and supports the conjecture that tw  hya is accreting grain - depleted gas . unlike comparisons of ne with metals such as mg , si and fe , the ne / o diagnostic appears to be robust to the effects of compositional fractionation seen in coronal plasma .",
    "moreover , the ne and o lines are formed at the temperature of @xmath11  k expected of the accretion shocks on t  tauri stars , whereas dominant lines of fe xvii and higher charge states , mg and si are all formed at higher temperatures .    in the context of shock - produced versus coronal x - rays ,",
    "it is worth noting that the observed departure from a `` normal '' chemical composition can not be mimiced by a corona whose plasma is fed by accretion .",
    "the convective turnover time for ctts is of order a few hundred days @xcite and so accreting plasma , and any abundance peculiarity in these last accumulating fractions , is rapidly subsumed by the underlying star that would feed the corona .",
    "we interpret the different ne / o ratios in bp  tau and tw  hya as arising from different depletions of o in the accreting gas .",
    "the comparison of bp  tau with post - t  tauri stars indicates that it is accreting material which is essentially undepleted . in the case of tw  hya ,",
    "the o depletion amounts to a factor of @xmath25 or more .",
    "why should bp  tau and tw  hya exhibit distinctly different o depletion in their accreting plasma ?",
    "we propose that this reflects the different ages and evolutionary states of these stars .",
    "there is some controversy concerning the age of bp  tau , though this is entirely the result of its uncertain hipparcos parallax .",
    "the hipparcos data indicate a distance of only 42 - 70  pc ( @xmath26  range)well in front of the taurus cloud at 140  pc in which it is generally thought to reside @xcite . based on this distance",
    ", @xcite estimated bp  tau to be as old as 35  myr through comparison with evolutionary tracks .",
    "however , both @xcite and @xcite refute the hipparcos distance based on its low statistical significance .",
    "@xcite find that the astrometric fit to the hipparcos data for the distance of the taurus cloud of 140  pc , instead of 42 - 70  pc , represents only a @xmath27 deviation , and point out that bp  tau is rather faint for the nominal distance to be reliable .",
    "they also show the hipparcos distance of 32 - 52  pc for for df tau  the other taurus star found by @xcite to be of anomalous proximity  to be highly uncertain owing to binarity and photometric variability . allowing for a somewhat smaller distance than 140  pc , but not as extreme as the hipparcos value , @xcite estimate a range of 2 - 10  myr .",
    "however , all other observational evidence points to bp  tau lying in the taurus cloud , including radial velocity and proper motion @xcite , extinction of @xmath28 ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and strong interstellar na i absorption @xcite . @xcite estimate the age to be 0.6  myr .",
    "in contrast , the distance and age of tw  hya are much more secure : with an age of @xmath1  myr ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , tw  hya appears significantly older than bp  tau .",
    "tw  hya is in fact one of the oldest ctts known to be still accreting . more importantly ,",
    "near infra - red measurements also show the inner disks of the two stars to be quite different . veiling",
    "measurements for bp  tau show a very large excess of 0.6 at @xmath29 m @xcite , and @xmath30 @xcite  typical of the accreting stars in taurus , 95%  of which have @xmath31 colours in the range 0.35 - 1.2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that bp  tau has an optically thick disk whose dust truncation radius is essentially at the corotation radius from which magnetospheric accretion is thought to take place ",
    "material from both gas and dust will therefore accrete and this material will not be depleted .",
    "instead , tw  hya has very little near - infrared excess shortward of 10@xmath32 m , with @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this is more typical of @xmath31 for the _ nonaccreting _ stars in taurus that are in the range @xmath34 - 0.25 for similar spectral types ( k7-m2 ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , the inner disk of tw  hya appears to be almost completely cleared ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently there is very little material in the form of small dust particles available to accrete and replenish the gain - depleted gas .",
    "depletion is also in evidence in the unexpectedly weak or absent si lines in uv spectra @xcite , and in low al and si abundances in the gas jet of tw  hya inferred by @xcite .",
    "this depletion is in qualitative accord with the infrared detection of excess emission at 8 - 13@xmath35 m attributable to silicates , and the spectral energy distribution that indicates that grain formation and coagulation into larger particles is well advanced @xcite .",
    "larger grains would be expected to settle in the midplane of the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite speculate that the truncation of the outer disk at @xmath36  au inferred from the negligible near - infrared excess could be a developing gap caused by a growing protoplanet . in this scenario",
    ", the depletion of metals and oxygen in the x - ray spectrum of the shocked accreting gas would be the result of retention of these elements in bodies of sufficient size that they are not significantly affected by the drag of inwardly migrating gas that feeds the accretion .",
    "we have investigated the ne / o abundance ratios of the accreting gas of the t  tauri stars tw  hya and bp  tau using high resolution x - ray spectra of h - like and he - like resonance lines , and have compared these to the same ratio for the coronal plasma of sample of magnetically - active main - sequence and evolved field stars . in the case of bp  tau , we find an ne / o abundance ratio in good agreement with that of the coronal plasma of field stars .",
    "in contrast , the ne / o ratio for tw  hya is higher than for the rest of the sample by a factor of two .",
    "we interpret these results in terms of a relative depletion of o in the material accreting from the inner disk of tw  hya as compared with bp  tau .",
    "this can be attributed to the different , partially age - related , evolutionary states of the disks of these stars . in the bp  tau",
    "disk , dust is still present near the disk corotation radius and can be ionized and accreted , re - releasing elements depleted onto grains . in the more evolved tw  hya disk , evidence points to ongoing coagulation of grains into much larger bodies , and possibly planets , that can resist the drag of inward - migrating gas , and accreting gas is consequently depleted of grain - forming elements .",
    "these results demonstrate the utility of high resolution x - ray spectra of ctts for probing directly the chemical composition of the accreting gas and the state of evolution of the very inner protoplanetary disk .",
