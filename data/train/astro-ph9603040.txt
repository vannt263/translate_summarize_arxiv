    "the apm galaxy survey ( maddox  1990a , b ) includes about two million galaxies down to magnitude @xmath1 over 4300 square degrees of the southern sky .",
    "it was the first machine - generated galaxy survey to cover an area of sky significantly larger than one schmidt plate , and has proved an important survey for measuring galaxy number - magnitude counts over a wide magnitude range ( ) and particularly for the most reliable measurement to - date of the angular correlation function of galaxies on large scales ( ) .",
    "this latter measurement was one of the first results to rule out the standard cold dark matter model of galaxy formation ( eg . ) .",
    "unfortunately , the apm galaxy survey , while complete to a faint magnitude limit of @xmath1 , is not very reliable for galaxies brighter than @xmath2 .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "firstly , the surface density of galaxies brighter than @xmath2 is only about @xmath3 of the surface density of stars at the same magnitude limit even at the galactic poles .",
    "therefore the selection of an uncontaminated bright galaxy sample requires an exceptionally reliable method of rejecting stars and merged images .",
    "secondly , photographic emulsions have a limited dynamic range , and in order to detect images as faint as @xmath1 , the brighter images are necessarily saturated .",
    "thirdly , bright stars have diffraction spikes and ` ghost ' images ( ) and large galaxies contain sub - structure .",
    "all of these factors prevent the standard apm image parameters , which were designed to classify small , faint images , from selecting a sufficiently reliable bright galaxy catalogue .",
    "this paper describes the construction of a bright galaxy catalogue , complete to @xmath4 , using the same apm scans used for the faint survey .",
    "we developed a semi - automated method of star - galaxy separation , whereby most stellar images were rejected ( losing only about 3% of galaxies ) and the remaining images inspected by eye on a film copy of the photographic plate .",
    "the distinction is emphasized between a survey _ constructed _ by eye , for example the catalogue or the lick ( ) survey , where the observer has to locate each image and _ then _ decide whether it should be included in the catalogue , and a semi - automated survey like the present one where the observer is given the position of each image satisfying a magnitude limit , and then classifies it as a galaxy or star .",
    "it is much easier for the eye to distinguish a galaxy from a star than it is to select a complete magnitude or diameter limited sample , and so the semi - automated survey should be much more reliable .",
    "the apm bright galaxy catalogue ( apm - bgc ) covers almost the same area as the faint apm galaxy survey of maddox  ( 1990a , b ) , including 180 out of the 185 fields of the fainter survey , an area of approximately 4,180 square degrees .",
    "figure  [ fig : fields ] shows the distribution of the 180 survey fields in an equal area projection on the sky .",
    "the construction of the present catalogue was first described by loveday ( 1989 ) .",
    "a similar survey has been carried out by raychaudhury ( 1989 ) in the region towards the ` great attractor ' , and there is an ongoing effort ( raychaudhury  1994 ) to map out the galaxy distribution near the equator .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "the construction of the bright galaxy catalogue , including star - galaxy separation and plate matching , is described in  [ sec : constr ] .",
    "internal tests for uniformity , completeness and consistency are described in ",
    "[ sec : int_tests ] and comparison with other catalogues is made in ",
    "[ sec : other_cats ] . ",
    "[ sec : photometry ] describes the ccd calibrations used to check the apm to @xmath0 magnitude conversion , as a further test of photometric uniformity in the survey , and to define a second - order correction for photographic saturation . in  [ sec : catalogue ] we describe the catalogue data and present plots of the galaxy distribution .",
    "we compare the angular and spatial correlation functions of early and late type galaxies in the apm - bgc in ",

    "finally , the properties of the catalogue are summarized in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the automated plate measuring ( apm ) machine in cambridge is a high - speed laser microdensitometer with on - line image detection and processing .",
    "technical details are given by and by .",
    "plate scanning occurs in two passes  firstly the sky background is measured in @xmath5 0.5 mm ( 33.6 arcsec ) square pixels over the plate , with images being removed by median filtering .",
    "note that if a galaxy image occupies a substantial fraction of a sky pixel , then the sky will be biased high in that pixel and hence the flux from that and nearby galaxies will be underestimated .",
    "this could cause us to bias against low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "we plan to investigate this possible bias using simulations in a future paper .    in the second pass ,",
    "images are detected as connected groups of pixels with densities higher than a set threshold above local sky , determined from bilinear interpolation of the background map .",
    "each image is parameterized by fifteen numbers : integrated isophotal density @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 coordinates on the plate measured in @xmath9 units ; three second - order moments @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; peak density ; and finally an areal profile  the image area @xmath13 above eight density levels @xmath14 , where @xmath15 runs from 1 to 8",
    ". the threshold @xmath16 was set at twice the  noise in the measured sky , and corresponds to a surface brightness of @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 mag arcsec@xmath19 .",
    "the apm magnitude @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 , and so is reversed in sign from usual magnitude systems . a rough conversion , accurate to @xmath22 0.5 mag , from @xmath20 to @xmath0 for @xmath23",
    "is given by @xmath24 .",
    "this zero - point differs from that for faint images due to mild saturation of the brighter galaxies .      for twelve of the survey plates ,",
    "a @xmath25 pixel raster scan was made , using the apm machine , around the 4000 brightest images on each plate . displaying each raster scan in turn",
    "enabled rapid classification of these images .",
    "unfortunately , constraints on the amount of apm scanning time available meant that only a small fraction of the survey plates could be scanned in this way .",
    "therefore , a semi - automated method for separating stars from galaxies , using just the standard apm image parameters described above , was devised and is described in this subsection .    in the faint survey ( maddox  1990a ) ,",
    "areal profile information ( the ` @xmath26-classifier ' ) is used to discriminate galaxy from stellar and noise images on each survey plate .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is defined as = 1000 ( _ i=1 ^ 10 w_i(m)[p_i(m ) - p_i^*(m)]^2 ) , [ eqn : psi ] where @xmath27 is the @xmath15th areal profile for @xmath28 , the peak density for @xmath29 and the radius of gyration for @xmath30 . for each parameter @xmath27 , a scatter plot against magnitude @xmath20 is produced , and the stellar locus @xmath31 is located as a function of magnitude . for each image",
    "the difference between the parameter @xmath27 and the stellar locus @xmath31 at the appropriate magnitude is calculated for all @xmath15 .",
    "the differences from each @xmath27 are summed in quadrature with a set of weighting factors @xmath32 , equal to the reciprocal of the estimated variance in @xmath27 .    for objects in the magnitude range @xmath33 , selecting images with @xmath34",
    "yields a galaxy sample that is @xmath35 complete and with @xmath36 contamination from stellar and merged stellar images . for brighter objects",
    "the number of stars relative to the number of galaxies becomes very large and so a @xmath26-selected galaxy sample will suffer from an unacceptable rate of contamination .    at @xmath37 , the best galaxy sample that can be selected using the @xmath26 parameter has @xmath38 contamination from stars and merged images , although many of the merged objects can be identified using an additional two parameters based on the radius of gyration and the fraction of saturated image area ( maddox  1990a ) .",
    "use of the ` @xmath39 ' and ` @xmath40 ' parameters reduces merger contamination to @xmath41 at @xmath42 .    for such bright objects",
    ", the apm parameterization no longer contains all the information available from the ukst plates .",
    "the stars display haloes and diffraction spikes , and galaxies have detailed sub - structure .",
    "also , both stars and galaxies are saturated .",
    "therefore we used areal profile information in conjunction with visual inspection of photographic plate copies in order to select a more reliable bright galaxy sample .",
    "the 3000 or so images with @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) on each plate from the scans of maddox  ( 1990a , b ) are sorted by density and binned with twenty objects per bin .",
    "stellar profiles cluster closely around the median for each bin as @xmath35 of images with @xmath45 are stars .",
    "since galaxies are resolved , extended objects , they have a broader profile and thus stand out from the stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : profile ] shows areal profiles for ( a ) 10% of stars and",
    "( b ) all galaxies in the apm magnitude range 12.512.6 on one plate",
    ". the median area is calculated at each profile level in each magnitude bin .",
    "twenty objects per bin is a good compromise between having a small density range per bin but therefore only a few images to determine the median , and having wider bins giving a less noisy median but wider scatter about the median .",
    "we define the ` profile residual error ' ( pre ) , @xmath46 , for image @xmath47 by @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the area at the @xmath15th profile level for image @xmath47 and @xmath50 the median area at the @xmath15th profile level for @xmath47 s magnitude bin .",
    "the denominator @xmath51 gives extra weight to higher profile levels , where there is smaller area .",
    "this is desirable since at low surface brightness levels haloes around bright stars often resemble galaxies , it is only towards the brighter core of the stellar image that bright stellar profiles become regular .",
    "the factor @xmath52 scales each pre by the median isophotal area for that magnitude bin to the power @xmath53 , since one expects large images , having more pixels , to suffer less from poisson noise .",
    "this definition of profile residual error is more general than the @xmath26 classifier ( equation  [ eqn : psi ] ) used for the faint survey ( , maddox  1990a ) and allows a better star / galaxy separation for bright images to be achieved .",
    "choice of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath53 is discussed below .",
    "the raster scan classifications proved to be very valuable for calibrating the performance of the pre in separating stars from galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : pre ] plots the profile residual error @xmath54 against apm magnitude for one field .",
    "the dashed horizontal line marks the pre cutoff used for rejecting stars and the symbols show image classifications made from the raster scans .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : pre ] , that even using the customized pre parameter , visual checking of some images is unavoidable to obtain a @xmath55 complete galaxy sample with less than 5% stellar contamination .",
    "it was decided to aim for a galaxy sample with @xmath56 completeness and with negligible stellar contamination by rejecting obvious stars with a low value of @xmath54 and then inspecting the remaining images on a film copy of the plate .",
    "the weighting powers @xmath57 were adjusted to minimize the number of images @xmath58 that needed to be inspected to obtain a completeness of 97% for the twelve plates which had been pre - classified from raster scans .",
    "the optimal values of @xmath57 were found to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . by minimizing @xmath58 for each of the twelve rastered fields separately , the parameters @xmath62 were found to have standard deviations of 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.2 respectively . using these parameters required all images with @xmath63 , an average of 539 objects for each of these twelve plates , to be inspected to obtain 97% completeness . an aimed completeness of 98%",
    "would have required an average of 665 objects to be inspected on each plate . as well as taking about 20% longer ,",
    "nearly all of the additional images would be stars , and the ` tedium factor ' of checking so many stars might actually cause more galaxies to be missed .",
    "there is a danger that plate - to - plate variations in @xmath54 ( due to differences in seeing ) could give rise to changes in completeness , but this should be unimportant since we identify only about 125 galaxies per plate down to @xmath2 , and so a change in completeness of 3% would have a much smaller effect on the number of identified galaxies than poisson fluctuations in the galaxy density .",
    "images larger than 12 mm in diameter cause problems since they are often either removed by the apm machine or split up into many sub - images . in order to understand why the apm machine removes large images ,",
    "some understanding of the way in which apm scanning is carried out is necessary .",
    "note that since the plates for this survey were scanned , the apm hardware has been upgraded which completely avoids the problem .",
    "the following description refers to the operation of the apm machine when the apm - bgc survey was being carried out .",
    "the apm machine scans the plate in 3 areas ",
    "horizontal strips across the top , middle and bottom of the plate .",
    "each area is scanned in 2 mm columns , each of which overlaps the previous column by 1 mm , so that nearly every part of the plate is scanned twice , in addition to the preliminary background scan .",
    "the pixel locations and densities above the threshold in each column are stored in memory so that they can be merged with adjoining pixels in the subsequent column .",
    "due to available memory constraints , image pixels can not be stored for more than one column , and so any group of pixels spanning more than two scan columns is dropped from the image list .",
    "thus all images larger than 2 mm in horizontal extent are lost , and those larger than 1 mm will be lost if they happen to span three columns . as an example , the dense central region of a globular cluster will often be removed , leaving an annulus of tightly - packed images marking the outer regions of the cluster . also , large images will of course obscure any galaxies lying behind them .",
    "thus regions around large images were ` drilled ' out of the survey as follows .",
    "a grey - scale plot of the apm background map was made for each field and compared with a film copy of the plate .",
    "any large images and bad satellite trails were marked on the plot .",
    "the same background map was then displayed on an image display and the vertices of parallelogram - shaped holes defined interactively .",
    "parallelograms were chosen to enable satellite trails to be removed , although in practice these trails rarely showed up on the background maps and most holes drilled were rectangular .",
    "a file of hole coordinates was saved , with typically ten holes drilled per plate .",
    "all objects brighter than @xmath64 , an average of 3124 images per plate , were extracted from @xmath65 images detected by each scan .",
    "the profile residual error @xmath54 ( equation  [ eqn : pre ] ) was calculated for each of these bright images .",
    "areas around large images were drilled out as described above , and a plate - scale finding chart marking objects brighter than @xmath66 and with pre @xmath67 , 425 objects per plate when averaged over the whole survey , was made . by placing the finding chart under a film copy of the plate",
    ", these objects were inspected with a magnifying lens and assigned a 1 digit classification code as shown in table  [ tab : classns ] .",
    "blended images were only placed into class 8 when stellar and galactic components were of comparable intensity as judged by eye .",
    "most large galaxies contain one or two faint stellar images which were ignored in this classification scheme .",
    "an average of 124 objects per plate ( about 30% of those inspected ) were classified as a galaxy , and eyeballing each plate took about two hours .",
    "it is important for statistical studies of galaxy clustering that a catalogue be uniform , or at least have a known selection function , over its whole area . due to slight variations in observing , processing and scanning conditions , the magnitudes measured from different plates for the same object can vary by about @xmath68 mag .",
    "[ fig : plate_zero_points ] below ) .",
    "galaxies in the plate overlap regions were therefore used to match the plates onto a common magnitude system .",
    "since the field centres are separated by 5 , and the apm scans cover the full @xmath69 area of the ukst plates , there is an overlap of about @xmath70 between neighbouring plates .",
    "the 180 eyeballed survey plates give rise to 493 overlaps , with an average of twelve galaxies in each overlap .",
    "only galaxies were used in the overlap comparisons since stars brighter than @xmath2 are very badly saturated on ukst j - plates .",
    "these galaxies are used to calculate a magnitude zero - point offset between each pair of plates . an iterative algorithm ( maddox 1988 , )",
    "is then used to find the set of additive plate corrections most consistent with the overlap zero - point offsets .",
    "figure  [ fig : overlap_mags ] plots magnitude difference against mean magnitude for each matched pair of overlap galaxies ( a ) before and ( b ) after plate matching .",
    "the matching procedure reduces the  magnitude difference from 0.28 to 0.18 , and since there are an average of twelve galaxies per overlap , the  error in zero point per overlap @xmath71 mag .",
    "thus whereas plate matching in the faint survey , with about 3000 galaxies per overlap , is dominated by systematic errors of order 0.03 mag in the field corrections , here we are dominated by random errors in individual galaxy magnitudes .",
    "( the following section suggests that field - effects , which could give rise to systematic errors , are negligible . )",
    "we do not use the corrections from the faint survey since most bright galaxies are affected by saturation , and some plates are more saturated than others .",
    "figure  [ fig : plate_zero_points ] is a histogram of plate corrections found by the matching procedure . the distribution is roughly gaussian with @xmath72 . since the eyeballed samples were limited to a fixed apm magnitude limit before matching , the shallowest fields after matching were up to 0.5 mag brighter than the mean .",
    "although many fields were eyeballed to a much fainter limit , a complete sample could be obtained only by limiting to the matched magnitude limit of the shallowest field , @xmath73 .",
    "the number of galaxies to this limit was only 6250 , and so a second pass was made , eyeballing those survey plates with a matched magnitude limit shallower than @xmath74 down to this limit .",
    "the plate matching was then repeated as the larger number of overlap galaxies changes the field zero - points slightly .",
    "an error in the matching procedure ( due to too many iterations ) was subsequently discovered ( loveday 1989 ) , resulting in the magnitude limit of the shallowest field being @xmath75 .",
    "after this second pass , 14681 out of 23747 eyeballed galaxies satisfied the matched magnitude limit @xmath76 .",
    "an equal - area plot of the final plate zero - point corrections is shown in figure  [ fig : zero_points_new ] .",
    "in any wide - field telescope such as a schmidt one expects vignetting towards the field edges , and indeed this can be seen on the plates .",
    "the apm machine partially corrects for this by on - line background subtraction .",
    "maddox  ( 1990b ) have discussed in detail why vignetting is still a problem for faint images . basically , vignetting decreases the slope of the measured density _ vs. _ flux relation so that images measured in vignetted regions of the plate are analyzed at a higher threshold than those near the centre . for brighter images , threshold effects become negligible and for saturated images vignetting can actually increase the measured magnitude .",
    "this is because saturation density is roughly constant over the whole plate , independent of vignetting , whereas the sky level _ is _ decreased by vignetting , and so the sky - subtracted density of saturated images will tend to increase towards the field edges .",
    "the actual field response function is not necessarily radially symmetric due to differential emulsion desensitization , but there are too few bright galaxies to measure the response as a function of 2-dimensional position on the plate . in order to estimate the response function ,",
    "we have calculated the galaxy density in annular bins centred on each schmidt field and then summed over all of the survey plates . by averaging over 180 fields , any real structure in the galaxy distribution on a scale @xmath77 plate size should be well averaged out . to compute the area of each annular bin that lies inside the scanned region of the plate ,",
    "5000 points were thrown down in the central @xmath78 square of each plate at random , avoiding drilled regions .",
    "the galaxy density , normalised by the density of random points is plotted in figure  [ fig : vig ] .",
    "it can be seen that the normalised galaxy density lies within about one standard deviation of that for a random distribution as far as the field edges ( 2.5 ) , although there is marginal evidence for increasing galaxy density towards the field edges . between the field edges and the extreme corners at @xmath79 , the galaxy density drops to about 80% of",
    "that expected for a random distribution . for number counts in a euclidean universe , @xmath80 ,",
    "a twenty percent decrease in counts corresponds to a magnitude change @xmath81 mag .",
    "only the extreme corners of the field suffer from serious vignetting , and these observed field effects are small enough not to significantly degrade the plate matching",
    ".    one might expect the observed field response function shown in figure  [ fig : vig ] to introduce a spurious signal in galaxy clustering estimated from the survey .",
    "a powerful technique for studying the effect of systematic errors on measured galaxy clustering is to compare the angular correlation function calculated from pairs of galaxies on the same plate ( intra - plate ) and from pairs of galaxies on different plates ( inter - plate ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : w_ii ] we plot intra- and inter - plate estimates of for apm - bgc galaxies . in this and other plots showing ,",
    "the error bars are determined by dividing the survey area into four zones and calculating the variance in  measured using galaxies in each zone as ` centres ' for the pair counts .",
    "these error estimates thus include the effects of clustering and cosmic variance , as well as poisson statistics .",
    "we see that the intra- ( solid symbols ) and inter - plate ( open symbols ) estimates of  are in very good agreement , apart from some noise in the inter - plate estimate on small scales and a small excess in the last intra - plate estimate .",
    "this last point is less than @xmath82 away from the inter - plate estimate and carries negligible weight in the overall  from all galaxy pairs since the ratio of intra- to inter - plate pairs at this separation is @xmath83 .",
    "another test which demonstrates that the field response function has a negligible effect on measured clustering is to generate the random points used in the  calculation with the _ same _ response function as the apm - bgc . in figure",
    "[ fig : w_vig ] we plot  estimated using all ( intra- plus inter - plate ) galaxy pairs using both a uniform distribution of random points ( solid symbols ) and random points distributed with the same field response function as the galaxies ( open symbols ) .",
    "we see no significant difference between the two estimates of , ( indeed , in many cases the symbols are indistinguishable ) , thus confirming that the response function shown in figure  [ fig : vig ] has no deleterious effect on clustering measured from the apm - bgc .",
    "we have compared the assigned classifications of objects detected on more than one plate to test the consistency of image classification . a pair of image detections is included in this analysis if both image magnitudes are above the magnitude cut - off for their respective plates and if neither image is in a drilled region . out of 14,358 galaxy images in the overlaps , where a galaxy is counted on _ each _ plate on which it was identified , 527 were checked on one plate but not on the other ( the pre was too ` stellar ' ) and 252 objects were inspected on both plates , but classified as a galaxy on one plate , and non - galaxy on the other .",
    "thus by using the pre as a cutoff in deciding which images to eyeball , @xmath84 of galaxies would not be checked in a single pass .",
    "an additional @xmath85 were inspected but mis - classified half of the time .",
    "the actual incompleteness is likely to be higher than this since a very high surface - brightness galaxy might be classified as a star on both plates .",
    "raster scans made of the bright images in twelve survey fields were used to investigate the overall completeness of the eyeball survey .",
    "the completenesses inferred range from 92.6% to 99.3% for the 12 fields , with a mean completeness of 96.3% , standard deviation 1.9% .",
    "table  [ tab : matches ] shows frequencies of pair classifications in the overlaps .",
    "the classification codes are defined in table  [ tab : classns ] , and type @xmath86 denotes an image that was not checked ( its pre fell below the cutoff ) .",
    "several features about the image classifications emerge from this table :    1 .   over a third of noise images",
    "are also classified as stellar .",
    "this is because the diffraction spikes and haloes of many bright stars are detected as separate images , and it is often difficult to decide whether an image should be classified as a bright star or noise .",
    "@xmath87 of galaxies classified as elliptical are classified as lenticular on another occasion , and @xmath88 of lenticulars are also classified as ellipticals .",
    "this illustrates the difficulty in distinguishing between the early - type galaxies , and the fact that there are more galaxies classified as lenticular than elliptical .",
    "nearly a quarter of lenticulars are also classified as spirals .",
    "there is a large overlap between irregular galaxies and spirals .",
    "most galaxies in the unsure type category ( type 5 ) are spirals , this is presumably because they are the most common .",
    "external checks on the classification reliability and survey completeness are made by comparison with three other southern galaxy catalogues in ",
    "[ sec : other_cats ] .",
    "given that the author had no experience of galaxy classification before starting this project , one might expect to see systematic variations in galaxy classification with time .",
    "most of the fields were originally eyeballed in three batches ; the second pass through was done in two batches .",
    "table  [ tab : trends ] shows the number of fields and galaxies eyeballed in each batch along with the percentage of galaxies of each morphological classification .",
    "clearly the ratio of elliptical to lenticular galaxies is much higher in batches 1 and 2 than in the later batches .",
    "the total number of early type galaxies ( e plus s0 ) in batch 1 is slightly higher than the average . in batch 5",
    "it is much lower than the others , and the fraction of spirals has risen accordingly .",
    "nearly all of the galaxies classified as uncertain are in batch 2 . for later batches",
    ", a greater effort was made to try and not use this class where possible .",
    "there are slightly more merged and multiple objects in batch 1 than the other batches .    to summarize , early type galaxies can not be reliably distinguished between elliptical and lenticular .",
    "batch 5 would appear to be deficient in early type galaxies .    if one combines elliptical and lenticular galaxies together , then the most discrepant batch regarding balance of morphological types is batch 5 , which includes only 17.3% early - type galaxies compared with 74.9% late - types . in order to investigate",
    "what effect this might have on the estimated correlation function for different morphological types we have divided the survey into two regions : those plates included in batch 5 and all the rest .",
    "we then count galaxy pairs in which both galaxies lie in the same region ( intra - region ) and those pairs in different regions ( inter - region ) .",
    "the intra- and inter - region estimates of  are shown in figure  [ fig : w_batch5 ] .",
    "we see that given the noise in the inter - region estimate , the two estimates are in reasonable agreement for all types ( a ) , although the intra - region estimate is biased slightly high relative to the inter - region estimate , an indication of small but systematic differences in galaxy density between the two regions . for early - type galaxies ( b ) , we see a larger systematic difference between the intra- and inter - region estimates on scales 17 degrees , @xmath89 .",
    "the late - type estimates ( c ) are in reasonable agreement , although the inter - region estimate is very noisy on scales less than 2 degrees .",
    "we thus conclude that systematic variations in galaxy classification reliability may introduce errors in the type - dependent of order @xmath90 .      to illustrate the dependence of classification on magnitude , in figure  [ fig : mag_type ] we show histograms of the fraction of each morphological type as a function of matched @xmath0 magnitude .",
    "the number of ellipticals is roughly constant except for large fluctuations around @xmath91 due to small number statistics .",
    "the number of lenticular galaxies is gradually increasing as the magnitude gets fainter .",
    "the combined early type number is dominated by the ellipticals at bright magnitudes and by the lenticulars at fainter magnitudes , where the overall trend is for increasing numbers of early type galaxies .",
    "conversely , the number of spiral galaxies decreases at fainter magnitudes .",
    "this suggests that as the images get fainter and spiral structure is harder to see , we are increasingly likely to classify a galaxy as a lenticular rather than a spiral if in doubt .",
    "note that in the deeper ( @xmath92 ) stromlo - apm redshift survey ( loveday  1992 ) there is a bias _ against _ classifying the fainter galaxies as early - type , as they are instead classed as ` uncertain ' .",
    "the fraction of galaxies classified as early type peaks near the magnitude limit of the apm - bgc .",
    "the fractions of irregular and ` uncertain ' galaxies both increase at fainter magnitudes .",
    "one should be aware of the magnitude - dependent bias in classification when interpreting type - dependent clustering results from the apm - bgc .",
    "[ sec : clust ] for such an analysis .",
    "two tests of the apm bright galaxy catalogue are made in this section .",
    "firstly we use the european southern observatory ( eso ) survey to identify any galaxies too large to be detected by the apm machine ( see  [ sec : large_ims ] ) and to check for galaxies found in the eso survey which are missed or misclassified in the apm - bgc .",
    "we then compare our galaxy morphological classifications with three other southern galaxy catalogues .",
    "the eso survey , ( lauberts 1982 ) , is a diameter limited galaxy catalogue , claimed to be complete to one arcminute , but also containing smaller disturbed galaxies , star clusters and planetary nebulae .",

    "this survey covers the southern sky from @xmath93 to @xmath94 degrees in declination and so is ideal for comparison with the apm bright galaxy catalogue .",
    "since the eso catalogue is diameter limited to 1.0 arcmin , which corresponds to about 0.9 mm on a schmidt plate , _ all _ galaxies too large to be detected by apm (  [ sec : large_ims ] ) should be found in the eso catalogue , assuming that the eso and ukst plates reach a similar limiting isophote .",
    "there are an average of 32 eso galaxies per schmidt field , with an average of 29 per field lying within 60 arcseconds of a bright apm image . those eso galaxies outside apm holes which did not have an apm image identified as a galaxy within 1 arcmin were inspected by eye .",

    "if any particular sort of galaxies were identified by eso but missed in the apm - bgc , apart from the large ( category 2 ) galaxies , high surface brightness compact ellipticals , we have looked at the distribution of morphological types and surface brightness for these galaxies .",

    ", we have compared morphological classifications of galaxies common to the apm - bgc and the eso surface photometry catalogue ( ) , the cluster catalogue and the southern galaxy catalogue ( sgc ) . since the morphological types in these catalogues are coded into the de vaucouleurs ` t - types ' ( ) , ( or a nearly equivalent system for dressler s data ) , which sub - divide the coarser apm - bgc elliptical - lenticular - spiral classifications , they provide a good check on our classification reliability .",

    "the coding is generally in very good agreement except for the overlap between elliptical and lenticular galaxies , and to a lesser extent between lenticular and spiral galaxies .",
    "of course , these catalogues are all shallower than the apm - bgc , and we expect slightly worse classification reliability at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the purpose of obtaining ccd calibrations was threefold : firstly , to determine an overall zero - point for the apm magnitudes ; secondly to check the plate matching procedure by testing for uniformity of the magnitudes over the survey area and thirdly to correct the magnitudes for the effects of photographic saturation .      the photometric observations were carried out with the siding spring observatory ( sso ) 40-inch telescope ccd system in 1988 and 1990 and with the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) 40-inch telescope ccd camera in 1988 .",
    "most of the galaxies observed were chosen from the stromlo - apm redshift survey ( ) , as well as a few sequences covering a wide magnitude range .",
    "for each galaxy , one 600s exposure was made in @xmath99 and two 600s exposures in @xmath100 ( sso ) or @xmath101 ( saao ) .",
    "we also observed 21 e - region standard stars from the list of .",
    "flat - field exposures of the twilight sky were made at the beginning and end of each night , weather permitting .",

    "reduction of the ccd data followed the usual steps of bias - subtraction , fixing of bad columns and cosmic - rays , and flat - field division .",
    "images were detected and parameterized using the apm images software ( ) . this software provides the same set of parameters for ccd images as are determined by the apm machine from the photographic images , with the additional options of calculating total image intensities and deblending merged images .",
    "both of these options were used . a detection threshold of 1.5 times  sky noise was set .",
    "any contiguous groups of 32 or more pixels ( @xmath102 arcsec@xmath97 ) above this threshold were analyzed .",
    "the two blue frames of each galaxy were co - added , after aligning the detected images , and images re - run on the co - added frame in order to minimize readout noise and lower the limiting isophote .",
    "ccd magnitudes were corrected for atmospheric extinction using the extinction coefficients of couch and newell ( 1980 ) for the sso data and of for the saao data .",
    "the standard star observations were then used to transform the ccd magnitudes into the couch and newell ( 1980 ) @xmath103,@xmath104 system using standard colour transform equations ( ) .",
    "the couch and newell system was chosen since their @xmath103 band is designed to match the uk schmidt j plate response function .",
    "data was only used from those nights for which the standard star ( observed @xmath105 published ) residuals were 0.05 mag or less .      determining galaxy magnitudes from the ccd frames and comparison with the apm magnitude needed to be done interactively due to the problems of merged images and occasional break - up of spiral - arm structure into sub - images .",
    "the four sets of ccd images ( one red , two blue and co - added blue ) were displayed as ellipse maps and , working from a laser printer grey - scale plot , any broken images were indicated with the cursor .",
    "a new image intensity and position for the broken images was obtained by summing the intensities and calculating an intensity - weighted mean of positions of the bits .",
    "the images in the four frames were then matched up .",
    "the co - added blue frame was used to determine the ccd blue magnitude , and the difference between the single blue frames and co - added frame was used to estimate a blue magnitude error . comparing the two blue frames is also a good test for photometric conditions since any cloud during the exposure would tend to make the blue magnitudes in one frame systematically higher or lower than the other . however , it is of course possible that cloud might affect only the red frame , which would alter the galaxy colours and hence the transform to standard magnitudes .",
    "we therefore rejected ccd frames if there was any doubt about the observing conditions being photometric .",
    "airmass corrections were applied and the ccd magnitudes were transformed into the couch and newell @xmath106 system using transform coefficients determined from the standard star observations .",
    "the ccd and apm images were paired up by displaying ellipse maps of both and indicating a few pairs with the cursor .",
    "these pairs were used to fit a 6-constant coordinate transform so that the remaining image pairs could be found automatically .",
    "any broken apm images were summed together in the same way as broken ccd images . for each galaxy frame a file was written listing natural ccd @xmath107 , @xmath99 magnitudes ; standard @xmath103 , @xmath104 magnitudes ; apm zero - pointed magnitude and apm coordinates for each image in the frame .",

    "then these residuals should be uncorrelated with both themselves and with the plate zero points determined from overlap matching (  [ sec : matching ] ) , which are plotted in the same projection in figure  [ fig : zero_points_new ] . to test for this we calculated the auto - correlation function of the ccd@xmath105apm residuals @xmath113 , and the cross - correlation with the plate zero points @xmath114 .",

    "since the  scatter in individual apm magnitudes @xmath120 mag and the  magnitude error per overlap is only 0.05 mag , we would require ccd photometry for @xmath121 galaxies per field to improve on the zero - points from overlap matching",
    ". therefore the ccd magnitudes were not incorporated into the plate matching procedure .",
    "in compiling the 180 contiguous survey fields into one catalogue , the cartesian plate coordinates were converted into right ascension and declination and only those galaxies within ( ra , dec ) boundaries equidistant from field centres were kept , thus avoiding duplication of galaxies in the overlaps .",
