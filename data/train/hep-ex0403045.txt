    "<S> we made a search for hadronic axions which could be emitted from the sun in m1 transitions between the first 14.4 kev thermally excited and the ground state in @xmath0fe , and absorbed in the hpge detector by axioelectric effect . </S>",

    "<S> the solution predicts the existence of a neutral spin  zero pseudoscalar particle , called axion , with a non  zero mass @xmath2 . the axion mass can be interpreted as a mixing of the axion field with pions and is related to the pq symmetry breaking scale @xmath3 by @xmath4 where @xmath5 mev is the pion mass and @xmath6 mev its decay constant . </S>",
    "<S> the axion mass , or the pq symmetry breaking scale , is arbitrary and all values solve the strong cp problem . </S>",
    "<S> the original pq suggestion that @xmath3 is equal to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale of 250 gev , which requires an axion mass @xmath2 of few hundred kev was quickly ruled out by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the constrains on the axion mass from various laboratory experiments , astrophysics and cosmology restrict the masses of axion to a narrow @xmath7 range . </S>",
    "<S> new axion models are introduced with breaking scale @xmath3 at values of @xmath8@xmath9 gev which escapes all the phenomenological constrains . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , all axion couplings become extremely small and axion models of this type are referred to as invisible axion models . </S>",
    "<S> two classes of invisible axion models have been developed : ksvz ( kim , shifman , vainshtein and zakharov ) or hadronic axion @xcite and dfsz ( dine , fischler , srednicki and zhitnitsky ) or gut axion @xcite model .    </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between ksvz and dfsz axions is that the former have no tree  </S>",
    "<S> level couplings to ordinary quarks and leptons because new fermions have been introduced that carry the pq charge while usual quarks and leptons do not . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the interaction of ksvz  type axions with electrons is strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> however , their coupling to nucleons is not zero due to the axion  pion mixing which exists even if the tree  level coupling to ordinary quark vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> axions are also one of the best known and most studied candidates for the cold dark matter in the universe </S>",

    "<S> photon coupling is model dependent and may be significantly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown by kaplan @xcite that as a result the astrophysical bounds on the axion mass are weakened and certain kim s models allow axion mass as large as @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> other astrophysical and cosmological bounds place a lower limit on the hadronic axion mass @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , axions in this narrow hadronic axion mass window of @xmath14 have been proposed as candidates for hot dark matter of the universe @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a possible source of axions is our sun . </S>",
    "<S> solar axion spectra would consist of the continuous part , generated through the primakoff effect and line spectra generated mostly in nuclear m1 transitions of some nuclides . </S>",
    "<S> huxton and lee @xcite have calculated axion emission rates from the sun for the m1 transitions in @xmath0fe , @xmath15mn and @xmath16na . </S>",
    "<S> other convenient sources of monoenergetic solar axions are m1 transitions in @xmath17li @xcite and @xmath18kr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> estimates suggest that the highest emission rate of monoenergetic axions will be produced during the 14.4 kev m1 transition in @xmath0fe . </S>",
    "<S> moriyama @xcite proposed to detect these axions using the resonant absorption process by the same nuclide in the earth  </S>",

    "<S> _ et al_. @xcite obtained an upper limit of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also searched for 477.6 kev and 9.4 kev axions , which were supposed to be emitted from the sun during m1 transitions in @xmath17li and @xmath18kr and resonantly absorbed by the same nuclides in our laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> we did not observe such events and only upper limits on the hadronic axion mass of 32 kev @xcite and 5.5 kev @xcite at the 95% confidence level were obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> other possible interactions for detecting hadronic axions are : ( i ) compton conversion of an axion to a photon @xmath20 , and ( ii ) axioelectric effect @xmath21 . </S>",

    "<S> coupling of hadronic axions with electrons is much weaker than with nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> however , the high temperature in the sun s interior will broaden the nuclear line width in the sun and , in the experiments based on the resonant absorption , this reduces the effective axion flux by a factor @xmath33 ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the decay widths of the same nuclear state in the sun and in the earth  </S>",
    "<S> bound laboratory . in the axion  to  photon compton conversion and the axioelectric effect all axions emitted during nuclear transition in the sun will contribute , and this will compensate the smallness of the axion  electron coupling constant .    </S>",
    "<S> using theoretical predictions of zhitnitsky and skovpen @xcite we estimate that for the 14.4 kev axions the cross section for the axioelectric effect is about three orders of magnitude larger than the cross section for the axion  to  photon compton conversion process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we will further consider only the axioelectric effect . in this effect an axion dissappears and an electron </S>",
    "<S> is ejected from an atom . </S>",
    "<S> the electron carries away all the energy of the absorbed photon , minus the energy binding the electron to the atom . </S>",

    "<S> in the case of @xmath44 and for axion energies @xmath45 the cross section becomes    @xmath46    in our investigations of solar hadronic axions we have searched for a peak at 14.4 kev in a single spectrum recorded in a hpge detector . if observed , this peak could be interpreted as the result of the axioelectric effect of the 14.4 kev axions on germanium atoms , with subsequent absorption of the emitted electrons and accompanying x rays in the crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the 14.4 kev axions are supposed to be emitted from the sun in m1 transition between the first thermally excited state and the ground state in @xmath0fe . in this experimental set  up the target and the detector are the same and the efficiency of the system is substantially increased . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0fe is one of the stable isotopes of iron ( natural abundance 2.2% ) which is exceptionally abundant among heavy elements in the sun ( solar abundance by mass fraction @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> also the 14.4 kev level is relatively easy to excite thermally because its energy is comparable with the temperature in the sun core ( @xmath48 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the axion flux from the sun was estimated by moriyama @xcite using similar calculation as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he obtained the value of @xmath49 . as a result of the doppler broadening in the sun the estimated width of the 14.4 kev peak </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the total flux of 14.4 kev axions is expected to be @xmath51 .    in the search for the 14.4 kev peak we have re  analyzed single spectra accumulated in the hpge detector during our investigation of solar hadronic axions using @xmath17li . </S>",
    "<S> these axions were suggested to be created in m1 transitions between the first excited 478 kev and the ground state in @xmath17li and were expected to excite resonantly the same energy level in the @xmath17li target , placed in the laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequently emitted gamma rays were searched for in a hpge detector . </S>",
    "<S> run spectra were obtained with the 56.72 g lithium target placed in front of the detector while for the background spectra the lithium target was replaced with an appropriate absorber simulating background conditions . </S>",
    "<S> run and background were both counted during the collection time @xmath52 days each . </S>",
    "<S> attenuation of axions in detector shieldings is negligible and we could sum both run and background spectra and improve the statistics by duplicating the data collection time . </S>",

    "<S> the energy spectra accumulated for the 222.22 days are shown in fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained an energy calibration with a set of calibrated radioactive sources . </S>",
    "<S> the 14.4 kev peak is expected at the 55@xmath58 channel . </S>",
    "<S> energy resolution ( fwhm ) at this energy was estimated by extrapolating energy resolutions obtained from the higher energy region . </S>",
    "<S> the fwhm at 14.4 kev was estimated to be 0.9 kev which corresponds to 3.5 channels .    </S>",
    "<S> we can relate the axion mass with the number @xmath59 of counts , detected at 14.4 kev in our hpge crystal , with the expression    @xmath60    number of germanium atoms in our 50 mm in diameter @xmath53 40 mm thick hpge crystal is @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> factor 2 is number of electrons in k  shell . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic efficiency @xmath62 of our detector for the electrons and accompanying germanium x rays is @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the data were collected during @xmath64 s. introducing calculated @xmath65 into ( 2 ) we obtain for the cross section for the axioelectric effect on germanium atom @xmath66 ^ 2 { \\mbox{\\rm cm}}^2 $ ] . then from eq . </S>",

    "<S> we could not identify a peak at 14.4 kev . </S>",
    "<S> for the number of axioeffect events we used the number of counts detected in 6 channels at the 14.4 kev region and obtained an upper limit of @xmath68 events . </S>",
