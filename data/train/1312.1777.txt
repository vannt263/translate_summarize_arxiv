    "their nature remains unknown .",
    "two scenarios are being actively discussed : subcritical ( at a rate below the eddington limit ) accretion onto a black hole of intermediate , @xmath3 , mass ( imbh , see , e.g. , @xcite ) and supercritical accretion onto a black hole of stellar , less than a few tens of @xmath4 , mass ( stmbh , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , possibly with substantial collimation of radiation toward the observer ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both scenarios are of great interest , since in the former case , there appears an opportunity to explore the conditions that may reflect an intermediate phase of supermassive black hole growth , and in the latter case , an extreme regime of gas accretion onto black holes .",
    "it can not be excluded that the former scenario is realized in some ulxs , while the latter in others .",
    "so far , x - ray observations of ulxs have been carried out almost exclusively at energies below 10  kev , and many spectra measured in the 210  kev energy band could be described by a simple power law with a slope @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "below 2  kev , an additional soft component with a color temperature of several hundred ev was sometimes detected .",
    "it was suggested that this component could be thermal emission from a geometrically thin , optical thick accretion disk around an imbh , analogous to the hotter ( @xmath6  kev ) radiation observed from normal x - ray binaries in their soft / high state .",
    "if so , the lower temperature of the disk could imply @xcite a higher mass of the compact object in ulxs compared to x - ray binaries , whereas the power - law component in ulx spectra could be attributed to comptonized radiation from an optically thin , hot corona of the accretion disk .",
    "however , this picture faces certain difficulties .",
    "in particular , a number of ulx spectra obtained in long observations by chandra and xmm - newton are poorly described by a power law and have convex shape in the 210  kev energy band . if one describes such spectra in terms of blackbody radiation from a thin accretion disk , the temperature near its inner boundary proves to be 23  kev .",
    "such values could be expected , at high accretion rates , for stmbhs , but certainly not for imbhs .",
    "however , the measured ulx luminosites are @xmath7  erg / s , which exceeds the eddington limit for a compact object of stellar mass . therefore , an alternate scenario for ulxs has been actively discussed , namely supercritical accretion of matter onto a stmbh through a geometrically thick disk with a powerful gas outflow ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case , the unusual x - ray spectral shape at energies above 2  kev is interpreted as the result of comptonization of the relatively soft emission from the accretion disk in an optically thick corona and/or outflowing wind @xcite .",
    "measurements in the hard x - ray range could help advance the understanding of the nature of ulxs .",
    "however , such observations were impossible until recently , because even the brightest ulxs have x - ray fluxes of less than 1  mcrab in the 210  kev energy band and are often located in sky regions with high number density of x - ray sources .",
    "the capabilities of the integral observatory @xcite , namely the combination of relatively high sensitivity and good angular resolution , have made it possible to overcome these difficulties for the first time .",
    "however , even in this case very long exposures are required . beginning in late 2009 , following our proposal , within the russian share of observing time ,",
    "integral has been performing deep observations at energies above @xmath8  kev of a sky region containing the m81 group of galaxies .",
    "the targets of these observations are the nucleus of the m81 galaxy and two well - known ulxs : hoix x-1  ( also known as m81  x-9 ) and m82 x-1 .",
    "interestingly , although both of these ulxs are among the brightest over the whole sky in terms of both flux and luminosity , they are located within one degree of each other . up to now , data for nearly 6  ms worth of observations have been accumulated . within the same scientific program ,",
    "the xmm - newton x - ray observatory performed a series of observations of hoix x-1  and m82 x-1  in 2011 .",
    "the main goal of the coordinated observations by integral and xmm - newton was to build the x - ray spectra of the aforementioned ulxs in a broad energy range from @xmath9  ev up to several tens of kev . in the present paper , we report the results of these observations .",
    "in what follows , we adopt the distance to hoix x-1  to be 3.6  mpc , which is the distance to the m81 galaxy @xcite , whose satellite is the hoix dwarf galaxy , and that to m82 x-1  to be 3.5  mpc ( the distance to the m82 galaxy , @xcite ) .    observations of the m81 field started in the 7th cycle of integral observations ( ao-7 ) and were continued in the 8th and 9th cycles ( ao-8 and ao-9 ) .",
    "another series of observations of this region of the sky is planned to take place in late 2013 , within the 10th observational cycle of the integral observatory ( ao-10 ) . in table",
    "[ tab : obs ] , information about the dates and duration of the observations performed so far is collected .",
    "the total accumulated exposure is @xmath10  ms ( nominal exposure , uncorrected for the decrease in efficiency for off - axis observations of the sources ) for the ibis / isgri instrument .",
    "this time includes @xmath11  ks of archival data obtained in 20032004 , when hoix x-1  and m82 x-1  occasionally fell into the outer regions of the field of view ( 79  deg off - axis ) of the isgri detector .",
    "these archival data were taken into account in our analysis , although they barely increase the detection significance of the studied objects .",
    "in 2011 , the xmm - newton observatory carried out two series of observations of hoix x-1  and m82 x-1 , consisting of 4 and 5 pointings , respectively , with a duration of about 25  ks each .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] contains some key information about these observations .",
    "these observations were performed in time intervals that approximately coincided with the integral observations ( of much longer duration ) performed during ao-8 , hence one can regard the x - ray and hard x - ray observations carried out in 2011 as quasi - simultaneous .    in the present work ,",
    "we used only the data of the ibis / isgri detector @xcite from all the data obtained by integral .",
    "we have also analyzed the data from the jem - x instrument , but this has not provided any additional strong constraints on the x - ray flux from hoix x-1  and m82 x-1  at energies above 10  kev .",
    "we therefore built our analysis upon comparison of the xmm and isgri data .",
    "initial reduction of the isgri data consisted of reconstruction of sky images of the m81 field in a number of energy bands ( 2030 , 3045 , 4568 , ... kev ) using the standard algorithm @xcite utilized in a number of our previous studies .",
    "calibration of measured source x - ray fluxes was done using archival data of isgri observations of the crab nebula .",
    "figure  [ fig : int_image ] shows an image of the m81 field in the 2030  kev energy band , constructed using all the data obtained by isgri from october 2009 to january 2013 .",
    "the m82 x-1  source is detected at a @xmath12 significance level .",
    "its flux in the 2030  kev energy band is @xmath13  mcrab , which corresponds to @xmath14  erg / s/@xmath15 , assuming a crab - like spectrum . under the assumption of isotropical radiation ,",
    "the luminosity of m82 x-1  in the 2030  kev range is @xmath16  erg / s .",
    "m82 x-1  is practially undetected ( @xmath17 ) in the next energy band ( 3045  kev ) , nor in the higher energy bands .",
    "the hoix x-1  source is not detected even in the softest isgri energy band , the upper limit ( 2@xmath18 ) on its 2030  kev flux being 0.25  mcrab , or @xmath19  erg / s/@xmath15 ( assuming a crab - like spectrum ) .",
    "hence , the luminosity of hoix x-1  in the 2030  kev energy band does not exceed @xmath20  erg / s .    at a distance of just 13  arcmin from hoix x-1 ,",
    "there is a relatively bright hard x - ray source whose position is consistent with that of the nucleus of the m81 galaxy .",
    "this object belongs to the class of low - luminosity active galactic nuclei and its study in the hard x - ray range is of great interest but beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "because of the proximity to m81 , studies of hoix x-1  in the hard x - ray range were practically impossible before the advent of integral .",
    "the angular resolution of the bat telescope aboard swift is also insufficient for this purpose .    .",
    "denoted are the positions of hoix x-1 , m82 x-1 , and the nucleus of the m81 galaxy .",
    "the distance between hoix x-1  and m81 is 13. ]    figure  [ fig : int_lcurve ] shows the light curves of hoix x-1  and m82 x-1  in the 2030  kev energy band obtained using the isgri data .",
    "it is seen that the sources remained weaker than @xmath21  mcrab during the observations in 20032013 , although the data are of insufficient quality to judge about the variability of the studied objects .",
    "the reduction of the data obtained by the mos1 , mos2 , and pn instruments aboard xmm - newton was done using the standard software sas v.11 . since thee were no strong proton flares during our observations , data filtering was done in a standard way .",
    "figure  [ fig : xmm_image ] shows examples of images obtained with the pn detector of the epic camera in individual observations of hoix x-1  and m82 x-1  in 2011 .",
    "a bright x - ray source is detected in the direction of hoix x-1 , whose angular size is compatable with the signal expected from a point source .",
    "there are no other noticeable x - ray sources near hoix x-1 .",
    "this probably reflects the fact that the object is located on the outskirts of the dwarf galaxy hoix ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , there is strong emission from the direction of m82 x-1 , which can be attributed to the ulx at hand , however this signal is overlaid on a bright background created by the m82 galaxy .",
    "this background likely consists of a large number of unresolved faint objects and diffuse emission from the interstellar gas .",
    "as is shown below , the contribution of the galactic background can be taken into account during the analysis of the m82 x-1  x - ray spectrum obtained from the xmm - newton data .",
    "for the subsequent spectral analysis , we used the counts recorded within the circles of 13  radius around hoix x-1  and m82 x-1  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xmm_image ] ) .",
    "this region contains @xmath22% of all the photons from a point source , and this apperture coefficient was taken into account during the spectral analysis . to estimate the background unrelated to the emission of the host galaxy , we used regions located at distances @xmath233 from the studied objects . because m82 x-1  is located in the central region of the m82 galaxy , even the compact ( 13  ) spectrum - extraction region",
    "contains a number of other fairly bright x - ray sources , known from arcsec - resolution observations with the chandra telescope .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to remove the contribution of these sources during the analysis of the xmm - newton data .",
    "however , the chandra data suggest that this contribution is unlikely to exceed @xmath24% @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ho_spec ] shows the x - ray spectra of hoix x-1  measured with xmm - newton during the four observations carried out in 2011 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) , as well as the hard x - ray fluxes in the 2035 and 3550  kev energy bands obtained using the isgri data for the whole period of integral observations .",
    "we first carried out a spectral analysis of the xmm - newton data only , in the 0.213  kev energy band . to this end , we used the xspec package @xcite .",
    "a given model was fitted simultaneously to the data from all three x - ray cameras , pn , mos1 , and mos2 , allowing the model normalization to differ between the detectors .",
    "the resulting differences in the normalization proved to be less than 10% , and the data of the three detectors showed a good mutual agreement .",
    "each of the four spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ho_spec ] is the result of averaging over the pn , mos1 , and mos2 data ; a similar averaging was done for the corresponding spectral models .        as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ho_spec ] , the x - ray spectrum of hoix x-1  varied significantly over 2011 .",
    "the first spectrum , obtained on march 24 , exhibits a local maximum near 1  kev and a power - law continuum at higher energies .",
    "this spectrum is well fit ( see table  [ tab : ho_fits ] ) by a sum of a model of blackbody radiation from a multi - temperature accretion disk and a power law with an exponential cutoff at high energies , modified by absorption along the line of sight , i.e. , by the _",
    "wabs(diskbb+cutoffpl ) _ model in xspec .",
    "however , the statistical significance of the detection of a cutoff is low : replacement of the _ powerlaw _ model by _ cutoffpl _ , i.e. , addition of one degree of freedom , leads to a decrease of the @xmath25 value by only 6 .",
    "the paramaters of the _ diskbb _ model are a normalization and the temperature ( @xmath26 ) at the inner boundary of the multicolor disk .",
    "our analysis assumed that the disk is observed along its axis .",

    "the addition of isgri spectral points at energies above 20  kev leads to an interesting result .",
    "all the model spectra determined by fitting the xmm - newton data lie below the isgri points .",
    "this can be inetrpreted as the presence of an additional hard x - ray component in the source s spectrum . however , the statistical significance of this excess is low ( about @xmath201 ) .",
    "it is not unlikely that the additional hard x - ray flux is due to other point sources in the central region of the m82 galaxy , which can not be separated from m82 x-1  using xmm - newton data . in any case ,",
    "comparison of the hard x - ray flux measured by isgri with the xmm - newton spectra clearly implies a cutoff in the x - ray spectrum of m82 x-1  at energies above @xmath202  kev .",
    "using data of the xmm - newton and integral observatories , we have detected a cutoff at energies above 10  kev in the spectra of the ultraluminous x - ray sources hoix x-1  and m82 x-1 .",
    "previously , there were indications of the existence of such a cutoff in the spectra of these sources from observations with the suzaku observatory @xcite , however the crude angular resolution of the pin instrument precluded reliable separation of the hard x - ray fluxes of the ulxs and the low - luminosity active galactic nucleus m81",
    ".    the derived broad - band x - ray spectra can be well described by a model of comptonization of radiation in a cloud of gas of moderate temperature and large optical depth : @xmath203  kev , @xmath204 for hoix x-1 , and @xmath0  kev , @xmath205 for m82 x-1 .",
    "these values indicate that the comptonization takes place in a nearly saturated regime ( the comptonization parameter @xmath20610 , see , @xcite ) .",
    "such conditions are quite unusual for the hot coronae of accretion disks in normal x - ray binaries ( where accretion onto a stmbh at a subcritical rate occurs ) , but can be fulfilled during supercritical accretion of matter onto an imbh accompanied by a strong outflow of gas from the central regions @xcite . in this case , the soft emission component with a characteristic temperature of @xmath207  kev detected from hoix x-1  by xmm - newton can be related to regions of a thin accretion disk that are open to the observer ( beyond the spherization radius of the accretion flow ) or with the photosphere of the wind outflowing from the disk .    therefore , the reported results of xmm - newton and integral observations confirm the existence of a spectral state @xcite specific to ultraluminous x - ray sources , which is unlike any of the spectral states known for normal x - ray binaries .    for m82 x-1 , we have found an indication of an additional hard x - ray emission component .",
    "this radiation may hint at the presence in the inner part of the supercritical accretion flow of a hot corona similar to the coronae of accretion disks in x - ray binaries .",
    "however , this excess may also be associated with the unsubtracted contribution of other fairly bright x - ray sources in the central region of the starforming galaxy m82 , which are resolved by chandra @xcite .    given the findings of this study , we are awaiting with great interest the upcoming announcement of the results of hard x - ray observations of a number of ulxs by the new - generation observatory nustar , whose high sensitivity and angular resolution enable detailed studies of ulx spectral properties at energies above 10  kev for the first time .",
