    "the effect of disorder on magnetic systems remains , after decades of investigation , a not fully understood subject .",
    "it is then natural to investigate relatively simple models , to try to understand the common features of disordered systems . in this regard ,",
    "randomly diluted spin systems are quite interesting .",
    "first , they represent simple models which describe the universal properties of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition in uniaxial antiferromagnets with impurities @xcite and , in general , the order - disorder transition in ising systems in the presence of uncorrelated local dilution .",
    "second , they give the opportunity for investigating general problems concerning the effects of disorder on the critical behavior . indeed ,",
    "several important results , theoretical developments , and approximation schemes found for these models have been later generalized to more complex systems like spin glasses , quantum disordered spin models , etc ....    in this paper we consider three - dimensional randomly diluted ising ( rdi ) systems . their critical behavior has been extensively studied .",
    "@xcite there is now ample evidence that the magnetic transition in these systems , if it is continuous , belongs to a unique universality class , and several universal properties are now known quite accurately . beside the static critical behavior , we also investigate the dynamic critical behavior , considering a purely relaxation dynamics without conservation laws , the so - called model a ,  @xcite which is appropriate for uniaxial antiferromagnets .",
    "we focus on the dynamic ( time - dependent ) spin - spin correlation function @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an ising variable , the overline indicates the quenched average over the disorder probability distribution , and @xmath2 indicates the thermal average . from the function @xmath3 ,",
    "one obtains the static ( equal - time ) structure factor @xmath4 and the dynamic structure factor @xmath5 .",
    "they are physically relevant quantities , which can be measured in neutron or x - ray scattering experiments .",
    "@xcite it is therefore interesting to study the effects of disorder on these physical quantities , and check whether disorder gives rise to qualitative changes with respect to pure systems .",
    "we investigate their scaling behavior close to the magnetic transition for @xmath6 in the high - temperature phase .",
    "as we shall see , while the critical behavior of the static structure factor is very similar to that in pure ising systems , the critical behavior of the dynamic structure factor is significantly different ; in particular , the large - momentum behavior shows some new features .    since the critical region in the paramagnetic phase , i.e. for @xmath7",
    ", is located in the griffiths phase,@xcite it is mandatory to discuss first the relevance of the so - called griffiths singularities and griffiths tails for the universal critical behavior of the correlation functions when @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , one of the most notable features of randomly diluted spin systems is the existence of the so - called griffiths phase for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the critical temperature of the pure system .",
    "this is essentially related to the fact that , in the presence of disorder , the critical temperature @xmath11 is lower than @xmath10 , and therefore , in the temperature interval @xmath9 , there is a nonvanishing probability to find compact clusters without vacancies ( griffiths islands ) that are fully magnetized .",
    "they give rise to essential nonanalyticities in thermodynamic quantities.@xcite moreover , these clusters are responsible for a nonexponential tail in dynamic correlation functions.@xcite in the case of rdi systems one can show that @xmath12 ,   \\label{g - non - exp}\\ ] ] for any finite @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which implies a diverging relaxation time .",
    "we should mention that these effects are quite difficult to detect , and there is still no consensus on their experimental evidence even in systems with correlated disorder , in which these effects are magnified ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "griffiths essential singularities give quantitatively negligible effects on thermodynamic quantities and on the static critical behavior .",
    "one can argue that also the griffiths tail ( [ g - non - exp ] ) is irrelevant in the critical limit : the nonexponential tail does not contribute to the critical scaling function associated with @xmath3.@xcite this is essentially due to the fact that @xmath15 and @xmath16 that appear in eq .",
    "( [ g - non - exp ] ) are expected to be smooth functions of the temperature , approaching finite constants as @xmath17 .",
    "thus , in the critical limit , @xmath18 , @xmath19 at fixed @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the diverging correlation length , the nonexponential contribution simply vanishes . to understand why ,",
    "let us consider the simplified situation in which the contributions to the autocorrelation function @xmath3 due to the griffiths islands and to the critical modes just sum as @xmath22 where we neglect all couplings between griffiths and critical modes .",
    "here , @xmath23 is the critical contribution , while @xmath24 is the nonexponential griffiths tail , which dominates for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the time at which the two terms have the same magnitude . in the critical limit",
    "we have @xmath27 .",
    "since the critical limit is taken at fixed @xmath28 , the relevant quantity is @xmath29 , which diverges as @xmath30 approaching the phase transition .",
    "this means that , for any fixed value of @xmath31 , the condition @xmath32 is always satisfied sufficiently close to the critical temperature @xmath11 , i.e. , the nonexponential tail is negligible .    in order to determine the scaling behavior of the spin - spin correlation function ( [ twopi ] )",
    ", we perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of a three - dimensional rdi model on a simple cubic lattice and perturbative field - theoretical ( ft ) calculations . in the following we briefly summarize our main results .    the high - temperature critical behavior of the static structure factor @xmath4 is substantially analogous to that of @xmath4 in pure ising systems.@xcite we consider the universal scaling function @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the second - moment correlation length .",
    "we find that @xmath36 is very well approximated by the ornstein - zernike form ( gaussian free - field propagator ) @xmath37 : deviations are less than 1% for @xmath38 and increase to 5% at @xmath39 . at large momenta , for @xmath40 say , the static structure factor follows the fisher - langer law;@xcite in particular , @xmath41 with @xmath42 for @xmath43 .    at variance with the static case ,",
    "the dynamic structure factor displays substantial differences with respect to the pure case , even though , as expected , the griffiths tail turns out to be irrelevant in the critical limit .",
    "we consider the universal scaling function @xmath44 in the critical limit @xmath18 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 at fixed @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here",
    "@xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the zero - momentum integrated autocorrelation time .",
    "perturbative field theory shows that @xmath51 decays exponentially , as in the case of pure systems , and this is confirmed by the simulation results . in pure ising systems",
    "@xcite the large-@xmath48 decay rate of @xmath51 depends on @xmath47 : the large-@xmath48 behavior is very similar to that of @xmath51 in the noninteracting gaussian model , i.e. @xmath52 $ ] , where @xmath53 .",
    "this behavior drastically changes in the presence of random impurities ; in particular , the large-@xmath48 decay rate becomes independent of @xmath47 .",
    "mc simulations and ft perturbative calculations show that , for generic values of @xmath47 , @xmath51 has two different behaviors as a function of @xmath48 . for small values of @xmath48 , it decreases rapidly , with a rate that increases as @xmath47 increases , as it does in the pure system.@xcite for large @xmath48 instead , @xmath51 , and therefore @xmath54 , decreases with a momentum - independent rate . for large @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "we find @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are critical exponents , and @xmath58 does not depend on @xmath47 .",
    "we present a physical argument which relates the different large-@xmath48 behavior compared to pure systems to the loss of translational invariance .",
    "such a phenomenon is obvious for a given fixed sample , but at the critical point translational invariance is not even recovered after averaging over disorder , because of the absence of self - averaging .",
    "note that this phenomenon is only related to disorder and thus , it is expected in all systems in which disorder is relevant .    in general , the perturbative calculations predict a scaling behavior of the form @xmath59 for large @xmath47 , where @xmath60 is a function of @xmath48 such that @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "this behavior implies that @xmath3 is always nonanalytic for @xmath63 and any @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , because of eq .",
    "( [ gamma - largeq ] ) , the integral @xmath65 diverges for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the spatial dimension ) .",
    "since the moments of @xmath54 are directly related to the derivatives of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath13 computed for @xmath68 , the @xmath69-th derivative of @xmath3 diverges for @xmath70 ; hence @xmath3 is not analytic at @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that the scaling function @xmath71 , defined as @xmath72 behaves as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , for @xmath75 .",
    "mc simulations indicate that @xmath76 in three dimensions , which implies @xmath77 .",
    "this phenomenon does not occur in pure systems , since in this case the decay rate @xmath58 depends on @xmath47 and guarantees the integrability of the integrand which appears in eq .",
    "( [ moments - gamma ] ) for any @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 has an analytic expansion around @xmath78 , i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "this nonanalyticity should be a general property of random models in which disorder is relevant , and not specific of rdi systems .    finally , it is worth mentioning that in the case of three - dimensional randomly dilute multicomponent spin models , such as the @xmath80 and the heisenberg model , the effects of disorder found in rdi models are expected to be suppressed in the critical limit @xmath8 , and should only appear as peculiar scaling corrections .",
    "@xcite indeed , the asymptotic critical behavior of the correlation functions is expected to be the same as that in the corresponding pure model , because the pure fixed point is stable under random dilution ( according to the harris criterion,@xcite dilution is irrelevant if the specific - heat exponent @xmath81 of the pure system is negative ) .",

    "<S> this effect is not related to the presence of the griffiths tail , which is expected to be irrelevant in the critical limit , but rather to the breaking of translational invariance , which occurs for any sample and which , at the critical point , is not recovered even after the disorder average . </S>"
