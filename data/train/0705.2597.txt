    "classical adeles have been defined by a.weil and c.chevalley for a global field @xmath0 in the following way : _",
    "adeles _ are elements of the set @xmath1 , where @xmath2 runs over all valuations of the field @xmath0 , @xmath3 is the completion of @xmath0 at the point @xmath2 , and the _ restricted product _",
    "@xmath4 means that we consider only collections @xmath5 such that @xmath6 for almost all @xmath2 , where @xmath7 is the complete local ring corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "the set of adeles has a natural structure of a topological ring .",
    "its group of units is called the group of _ ideles _ and is equal to @xmath8 , where the restricted product is taken in the same sense as above with @xmath3 replaced by @xmath9 and @xmath10 replaced by @xmath11 ( we omit the details about a topological structure of the ideles ) .",
    "the group of ideles plays a central role in the classical one - dimensional global class field theory .",
    "one of its main properties is the relation with the class group @xmath12 of @xmath0 .",
    "actually there is a natural surjective homomorphism @xmath13 defined by the formula @xmath14 $ ] , where the sum is taken over all non - archemedian valuations @xmath2 and @xmath15 denotes a discrete valuation corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "further , j .- p.serre used in @xcite _ non - complete _ adeles on a _ curve _ @xmath16 over a field @xmath17 to prove the riemann ",
    "roch theorem for @xmath16 .",
    "namely he considered collections @xmath18 such that @xmath19 for almost all closed points @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the local ring of @xmath16 at @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , one may construct a non - complete version of ideles .",
    "moreover , serre was using a certain complex of adeles though he did not mention this explicitly .",
    "a.n.parshin introduced in @xcite non - complete ( also called _ rational _ ) adeles on a _ surface _ , and has constructed a certain _ adelic complex_. in @xcite there is also a multiplicative version of complete adeles on a surface , related to the @xmath23-functor , and have been proposed a natural two - dimensional generalization of the classical class field theory .",
    "later , a.a.beilinson defined in @xcite a complex of adeles @xmath24 for any noetherian scheme @xmath16 using simplicial language ( in fact , the adelic complex is defined for any quasicoherent sheaf @xmath25 on @xmath16 instead of @xmath26 ) .",
    "let us describe explicitly the complexes of rational adeles in low dimensions .",
    "for a curve @xmath16 over a field @xmath17 , it looks like @xmath27 where the restricted product is taken in the above sense and the differential is defined using the natural inclusions by the formula @xmath28 . for a surface @xmath16 , the rational adelic complex has the following form : @xmath29 where the restricted products can be defined explicitly in terms of the poles of functions , and the differentials are defined using the natural inclusion by the formulas @xmath30 and @xmath31 the beilinson ",
    "huber theorem tells that for any noetherian scheme , the cohomology groups of the adelic complex @xmath24 are canonically isomorphic to the cohomology groups @xmath32 , see @xcite , @xcite ( the analogous result holds true for any quasicoherent sheaf @xmath25 on @xmath16 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a version of these constructions for a class of sheaves of abelian groups on schemes different from quasicoherent sheaves , in particular , for _ sheaves of @xmath0-groups_. recall that a sheaf of @xmath0-groups @xmath33 is associated with the presheaf given by @xmath34)$ ] , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an open subset in the scheme @xmath16 and @xmath37 denotes the quillen @xmath0-group .",
    "recall that for a regular noetherian separable scheme @xmath16 of finite type over a field , there are gersten ( or cousin ) complexes @xmath38 whose cohomology groups are equal to @xmath39 . on the other hand , for the case of a regular curve @xmath16 , there is a natural quasiisomorphism of complexes @xmath40 where the restricted product is taken in the same way as before for rational adeles with @xmath41 replaced by @xmath42 and @xmath21 replaced by @xmath43 , @xmath44 stands for the residue field at @xmath22 , the complex on the bottom is the gersten complex for the curve @xmath16 , the first vertical morphism is the projection on the first summand , and the second one is given by residue maps .",
    "we give a higher - dimensional generalization of this .",
    "recall that in general the cousin complex of an abelian sheaf consists of direct sums over schematic points of fixed codimension . following the general definition of adeles ,",
    "we replace these direct sums by _ adelic groups _ , which are certain restricted products over _ flags _ of fixed length , i.e. , sequences of schematic points @xmath45 on a scheme @xmath16 such that @xmath46 for all @xmath47 . for the explicit construction of these groups in the simplest cases see examples [ simple_examples ] .",
    "next , we construct an _ adelic complex",
    "_ @xmath48 , which consists of adelic groups . under certain natural conditions",
    ", there is a canonical morphism of complexes @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the cousin complex of @xmath25 on @xmath16 .",
    "we restrict our attention to a special type of abelian sheaves , namely , sheaves associated with the presheaves of a homology theory that satisfies certain axioms ( see section [ homology - theories ] ) .",
    "our main result is that for such sheaves , the morphism @xmath51 is a quasiisomorphism on smooth varieties over an infinite perfect field . in particular , we get the following result .",
    "there is a canonical morphism of complexes @xmath52 .",
    "this morphism is a quasiisomorphism if @xmath16 is a smooth variety over an infinite perfect field .",
    "recall that one of the main advantages of the gersten complex is that it allows to relate explicitly cohomology of the sheaves of @xmath0-groups , called _",
    "@xmath0-cohomology _ , with the ( algebraic ) geometry of @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , the famous bloch  quillen formula says that @xmath53 , see @xcite . at the same time",
    "there is a canonical product between the sheaves of @xmath0-groups , induced by the product in @xmath0-groups themselves .",
    "this product structure can not be prolonged to the gersten complex : otherwise there would exist an intersection theory for algebraic cycles without taking them modulo rational equivalence .",
    "the main advantage of the adelic construction is that the flag simplicial structure , involved in the definition of the adelic complexes , allows to define a product on them , i.e. , the complex @xmath54 is a dg - ring .",
    "note that the general theory of sheaves provides many multiplicative simplicial resolutions of sheaves , i.e. , resolutions carrying the product structure , for example , chech or godement resolutions .",
    "nevertheless these resolutions seem to be too general to reflect the algebro - geometric structure of a scheme , for instance , relations of @xmath0-cohomology to algebraic cycles or direct images for proper morphisms . though the adelic complex as presented here also does not have direct images , the covariant gersten complex turns out to be a right dg - module over the dg - ring of adeles . roughly speaking , the difference between the adelic complex @xmath55 and the gersten complex @xmath38 consists of all possible _ systems of local @xmath0-group equations along flags _ for each irreducible subvariety on @xmath16 .",
    "the main idea is that in order to get an intersection - product on the groups of algebraic cycles we enlarge them by systems of equations instead of taking them modulo rational equivalence .",
    "analysis of the adelic complex provides certain explicit formulas for products and also massey higher products in @xmath0-cohomology .",
    "in particular , we obtain a new direct proof of the coincidence up to sign of the intersection product in chow groups and the natural product in @xmath0-cohomology .",
    "another example is the triple product @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "it occurs that this triple is equal to the weil pairing of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the case of a curve",
    "the equality of the corresponding explicit adelic formula with the weil pairing was proved by different methods in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in section [ defin - basic - adeles ] we define adelic groups for abelian sheaves on arbitrary schemes and study their basic properties , such as multiplicativity and contravariancy .",
    "section [ cousin - relation ] shows an important relation of the adelic complex with the cousin complex . in sections [ section - control - support ] and [ section-1-pure ]",
    "we establish more properties of adelic groups imposing rather mild conditions on sheaves . in section [ section - prime - adeles ]",
    "we define a new type of adelic groups , called @xmath61-adeles , which do not have a multiplicative structure but provide a flasque resolution for any cohen ",
    "macaulay sheaf .    in section [ homology - theories ]",
    "we introduce the notion of a homology theory locally acyclic in fibrations ( l.a.f .",
    "homology theory ) .",
    "we discuss the basic properties of an l.a.f .",
    "homology theory and define the associated homology sheaves . then , in section [ k - theory ] we define strongly locally effaceable pairs of closed subvarieties on a smooth variety with respect to an l.a.f . homology theory .",
    "this is a globalization of the method from quillen s proof of the gersten conjecture in the geometric case .",
    "section [ section - existence - addition ] contains the existence and the addition results for strongly locally effaceable pairs .",
    "in particular , we get some uniform version of the local exactness of a gersten resolution , which might have interest in its own right ( see corollary [ uniform_gersten ] ) . in section [ patching - systems - section ]",
    "we introduce the notion of patching systems of closed subvarieties on a smooth variety .",
    "this is our key tool for studying the relation between the adelic and the gersten complexes .",
    "section [ section - main - theorem ] contains the main result ( theorem [ quasiis ] ) : for any l.a.f .",
    "homology theory the adelic complex of the homology sheaves is quasiisomorphic to the gersten complex on any smooth variety over an infinite perfect field .",
    "after several easy reductions the proof of the main theorem is reduced to a certain approximation result , namely lemma [ approximation ] , whose proof uses the developed technique of patching systems . section [ explicit - classes ] is devoted to the explicit construction of cocycles in the adelic complex representing cocycles in the gersten complex .",
    "then we consider our main example of an l.a.f . homology theory ,",
    "namely the of schemes .",
    "we recall some general facts on @xmath0-sheaves and @xmath0-cohomology in section [ section - k - generalities ] .",
    "we also give some examples of the explicit @xmath0-adelic cocycles for algebraic cycles and we study the link between the @xmath0-adeles and the coherent differential adeles of parshin and beilinson .",
    "section [ euler_charact ] provides an explicit construction of an euler characteristic map from the @xmath0-groups of the exact category of complexes of coherent sheaves on a scheme @xmath62 that are exact outside of a closed subscheme @xmath63 to the @xmath64-groups of @xmath65 .",
    "this map can be also constructed using @xmath66-spaces introduced in @xcite or general preperties of waldhausen @xmath0-theory of perfect complexes given in @xcite .",
    "next , explicit formulas for products in @xmath0-cohomology in terms of gersten cocycles are obtain in section [ product_cocycles_section ] as a consequence of the product structure on the adelic complex  ( theorem [ intersecting_cycles ] ) .",
    "the case of certain massey triple products is treated in section [ section - triple - formula ] .",
    "we also show the coincidence of the considered massey triple product with the weil pairing between zero - cycles and divisors ( proposition  [ weil_massey ] ) .",
    "it is a pleasure for the author to thank a.n.parshin for his constant attention to this work and many helpful suggestions , c.soul for many useful discussions and remarks , d.grayson , and d.kaledin for important comments , which appeared after they read the manuscript of this text .",
    "the author is very grateful for the hospitality during his visits to institut de mathmatiques de jussieu , where many parts of the text had been written down .",
    "we use beilinson s simplicial approach to higher - dimensional adeles , first defined by parshin in the two - dimensional case ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . besides , we follow most notations from @xcite . for a cosimplicial group @xmath67 , let @xmath68 be the associated cochain complex .",
    "we define the differential in the tensor product @xmath69 of two complexes @xmath68 and @xmath70 by the formula @xmath71 . for a scheme @xmath16 ,",
