    "an optical link and frontend electronics has been developed to read out all 9600 channels of the h1 experiment s central inner multi  wire proportional chamber ( _ cip _ ) within the time between two bunch crossings , i.e. @xmath0 . the application requires a bidirectional multi  purpose link : the digitized chamber information has to be provided to the trigger system @xmath2 away , selected analog pulses should be accessible for monitoring purposes and the whole frontend electronics must be synchronized to the global hera clock signal .",

    "the direction of tracks can be inferred from the pattern of hit pads . for electron ",
    "proton collisions intersections of tracks with the @xmath9axis come mostly from the interaction region , while the dominating background originates from proton beam losses upstream of the experiment .",
    "experience has shown , that such background tracks seen by the h1 experiment are typically intersecting the @xmath9axis at @xmath10 to @xmath11 upstream of the mean @xmath12 interaction position .",

    "additionally , the encoding bits provide an error detection , tagging wrongly transmitted words , and include an user  controlled _ flag bit_. on the other hand , the unique bit pattern of the encoding scheme incorporates the high  speed clock signal and thus saves an additional clock signal line between transmitter and receiver .",

    "the data words are ( eventually ) inverted and then demultiplexed .",
    "the parallel automatic synchronization system synchronizes these words to an external reference clock signal . a master  slave mode allows for a synchronization of several hdmp1034 chips : a deviation of the relative phase of the data word and the reference clock signal generates a shift request , passed to the master .",
    "the master controls the delay of all outputs of all slaves .",
    "each @xmath30 data word is serialized by a hdmp1032 chip .",

    "the optical hybrid on the on  detector unit ( _ him _ , high  speed interconnection module ) acts as a driver for the outgoing @xmath33 packets and analog test signals and as a receiver for the incoming hera clock signal .",
    "the optical hybrid on the receiver unit side ( _ dehim _ ) acts vice versa .",
    "the interfacing pins require or deliver differential cmos logic signals for each data channel , respectively .    each him / dehim pair serves one double  segment , i.e. transmits four multiplexed data channels with a physical rate of @xmath1 , two analog test signal channels and two hera clock signal channels via an optical fiber array with eight fibers .",

    "the laser cavity can be grown to match the wavelength of the laser light , i.e. @xmath44 . the total spectral width of the emission is generally less than @xmath45 , which ensures a low coherence source .",

    "because of a delicate passivation , the softer ball  bond process using golden bond wires has been preferred to the wedge  wedge bonding and to the use of aluminum bond wires .",

    "since the distance between two cip layers is less than @xmath23 , it is not feasible to mount the mtp connector above the vcsel / pin array . even if the connector is reduced to its inner core , namely the _ ferrule _ , adjusting the ferrule perpendicular to the hybrid leaves no space to properly fix the connector to the optical hybrid .",
    "in addition , it complicates the installation of the fibers at the end flange .",
    "consequently the ferrule had to be mounted parallel to the optical hybrid , i.e. parallel to the @xmath9axis .",
    "since the diodes send the light perpendicular to the die , the light needs to be redirected .",
