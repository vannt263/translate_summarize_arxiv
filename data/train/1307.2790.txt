    "the recent advances of information technologies have boosted the emergence of networked control systems where information networks are tightly coupled to physical processes and human intervention .",
    "such sophisticated systems create a wealth of new opportunities at the expense of increased complexity and system vulnerability .",
    "in particular , malicious attacks in the cyber world are a current practice and a major concern for the deployment of networked control systems .",
    "thus , the ability to analyze their consequences becomes of prime importance in order to enhance the resilience of these new - generation control systems .",
    "this paper considers a single - loop remotely - controlled system , in which the plant , together with a sensor and an actuator , and the system operator are spatially distributed and connected via a communication network .",
    "in particular , state measurements are communicated from the sensor to the system operator through the network ; then , the generated control commands are transmitted to the actuator through the same network .",
    "this model is an abstraction of a variety of existing networked control systems , including supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) networks in critical infrastructures ( e.g. , power systems and water management systems ) and remotely piloted unmanned aerial vehicles ( uavs ) .",
    "the objective of the paper is to design and analyze resilient controllers against replay attacks .",
    "_ literature review .",
    "_ recently , the cyber security of control systems has received increasing attention .",
    "the research effort has been devoted to studying two aspects : attack detection and attack - resilient control .",
    "regarding attack detection , a particular class of cyber attacks , namely _",
    "false data injection _ , against state estimation is studied in  @xcite . the paper  @xcite studies the detection of the _ replay attacks _ , which maliciously repeat transmitted data . in the context of multi - agent systems ,",
    "the papers of  @xcite determine conditions under which consensus multi - agent systems can detect misbehaving agents .",
    "as for attack - resilient control , the papers  @xcite are devoted to studying _ deception attacks _ , where attackers intentionally modify measurements and control commands .",
    "_ denial - of - service _ ( dos ) attacks destroy the data availability in control systems and are tackled in recent papers  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the papers  @xcite formulate finite - horizon lqg control problems as dynamic zero - sum games between the controller and the jammer . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigate the security independency in infinite - horizon lqg against dos attacks , and fully characterize the equilibrium of the induced game . in our paper  @xcite , a distributed receding - horizon control law is proposed to ensure that vehicles reach the desired formation despite the dos and replay attacks .",
    "the problems of control and estimation over unreliable communication channels have received considerable attention over the last decade  @xcite .",
    "key issues include band - limited channels  @xcite , quantization  @xcite , packet dropout  @xcite , delay  @xcite and sampling  @xcite .",
    "receding - horizon networked control is studied in  @xcite for package dropouts and in  @xcite for transmission delays .",
    "package dropouts and dos attacks ( resp . transmission delays and replay attacks ) cause similar affects to control systems .",
    "so the existing receding - horizon control approaches exhibit the robustness to certain classes of dos and replay attacks under their respective assumptions .",
    "however , none of these papers characterizes the performance degradation of receding - horizon control induced by the communication unreliability .",
    "_ contributions .",
    "_ we study a variation of the receding - horizon control under the replay attacks .",
    "a set of sufficient conditions are provided to ensure asymptotical and exponential stability .",
    "more importantly , we derive a simple and explicit relation between the infinite - horizon cost and the computing and attacking horizons . by using such relation , we characterize a class of competitive ( resp .",
    "cooperative ) resource allocation problems for resilient networked control systems as convex games ( resp . programs ) .",
    "the preliminary results are published in  @xcite where receding - horizon control is used to deal with a class of deception attacks .",
    "the technical relations between this paper and  @xcite will be explained at the very beginning of section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "consider the following discrete - time , linear time - invariant dynamic system : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the system state , and @xmath2 is the system input at time @xmath3 .",
    "the matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the state and the input matrix , respectively . states and inputs of system",
    "are constrained to be in some sets ; i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for all @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 are running state and input costs , respectively , for some @xmath13 and @xmath14 positive - definite and symmetric matrices .",
    "we assume the following holds for the system :    * ( stabilizability ) * the pair @xmath15 is stabilizable .",
    "[ asm2 ]    this assumption ensures the existence of @xmath16 such that the spectrum @xmath17 is strictly inside the unit circle where @xmath18 . in the remainder of the paper , @xmath19 will be referred to as the auxiliary controller .",
    "we then impose the following condition on the constraint sets .    *",
    "( constraint sets ) * the sets @xmath20 and  @xmath21 are convex and @xmath22 for @xmath23.[asm5 ]      system   together with the sensor and the actuator are spatially separated from the operator .",
    "these entities are connected through communication channels . in the network , there is a replay attacker who maliciously repeats the messages delivered from the operator to the actuator . in particular ,",
    "the adversary is associated with a memory whose state is denoted by @xmath24 . if a replay attack is launched at time  @xmath25 , the adversary executes the following : @xmath26 erases the data sent from the operator ; @xmath27 sends previous data stored in her memory , @xmath24 , to the actuator ; @xmath28 maintains the state of the memory ; i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "in this case , we use @xmath30 to indicate the occurrence of a replay attack . if the attacker keeps idle at time  @xmath25 , then data is intercepted , say @xmath31 , sent from the operator to plant , and stored it in memory ; i.e. , @xmath32 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 is successfully received by the actuator . without loss of any generality , we assume that @xmath35 .",
    "we now define the variable @xmath36 with initial state @xmath37 to indicate the consecutive number of the replay attacks . if @xmath38 , then @xmath39 ; otherwise , @xmath40 .",
    "so , the quantity @xmath36 represents the number of consecutive attacks up to time  @xmath25 .",
    "a replay attack requires spending certain amount of energy .",
    "we assume that the energy of the adversary is limited , and adversary  @xmath41 is only able to launch at most @xmath42 consecutive attacks .",
    "this assumption is formalized as follows :    * ( maximum number of consecutive attacks ) * there is an integer @xmath42 such that @xmath43.[asm3 ]        replay attacks have been successfully used by the virus attack of stuxnet  @xcite .",
    "this class of attacks can be easily detected by attaching a time stamp to each control command . in the remainder of the paper , we assume that the attacks can always be detected and focus on the design and analysis of resilient controllers against them .      here",
    "we propose a variation of the receding - horizon control in ; e.g.  @xcite , to deal with the replay attacks .",
    "our * attack - resilient receding - horizon control law * , ( for short , ar - rhc ) is stated in algorithm  [ ta : algo ] .",
    "in particular , at each time instant , the plant stores the whole control sequence which will be used in response to future attacks .",
    "the terminal state cost is chosen to coincide with the running state cost .",
    "this is instrumental for the analysis of performance degradation in theorem  [ the1 ] .",
    "the following steps are first performed by the operator :    choose @xmath16 so that @xmath17 is strictly inside the unit circle .",
    "choose @xmath44 and obtain @xmath45 by solving the following lyapunov equation : @xmath46    choose a constant @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .    at each @xmath49 ,",
    "the operator , actuator and sensor execute the following steps :    the operator solves the following @xmath50-horizon quadratic program , namely @xmath50-qp , parameterized by @xmath51 : @xmath52 obtains the solution @xmath53 $ ] , and sends it to the actuator .    if @xmath54 , the actuator receives @xmath55 , sets @xmath56 , implements @xmath57 , and the sensor sends @xmath58 to the operator .",
    "if @xmath59 , the actuator implements @xmath60 in @xmath61 , sets @xmath62 , and the sensor sends @xmath58 to the operator .",
