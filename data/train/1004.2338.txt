    "graph drawing addresses the issue of constructing geometric representations of graphs in a way to gain better understanding and insights into the graph structures .",
    "surveys on graph drawing can be found in @xcite .",
    "if the given data is hierarchical ( such as a file system ) , then it can often be expressed as a rooted tree . among existing algorithms in the literature for drawing rooted trees ,",
    "the work of @xcite developed a popular method for drawing binary trees .",
    "the idea behind @xcite is to recursively draw the left and right subtrees independently in a bottom - up manner , then shift the two drawings along the @xmath0-direction as close to each other as possible while centering the parent of the two subtrees one level up between their roots .",
    "different from the conventional ` triangular ' tree drawing of @xcite , @xmath1-drawings @xcite , radial drawings @xcite and balloon drawings @xcite are also popular for visualizing hierarchical graphs .",
    "since the majority of algorithms for drawing rooted trees take linear time , rooted tree structures are suited to be used in an environment in which real - time interactions with users are frequent .",
    "consider figure  [ fgillustration ] for an example .",
    "a _ balloon drawing _",
    "@xcite of a rooted tree is a drawing having the following properties :    * all the children under the same parent are placed on the circumference of the circle centered at their parent ; * there exist no edge crossings in the drawing ; * the radius of the circle centered at each node along any path from the root node reflects the number of descendants associated with the node ( i.e. , for any two edges on a path from the root node , the farther from the root an edge is , the shorter its drawing length becomes ) .    in the balloon drawing of a tree ,",
    "each subtree resides in a _",
    "wedge _ whose end - point is the parent node of the root of the subtree .",
    "the ray from the parent node to the root of the subtree divides the wedge into two _ sub - wedges_. depending on whether the two sub - wedge angles are required to be identical or not , a balloon drawing can further be divided into two types : drawings with _ even sub - wedges _ ( see figure  [ fgillustration](a ) ) and drawings with _ uneven sub - wedges _ ( see figure  [ fgillustration](b ) ) .",
    "one can see from the transformation from figure  [ fgillustration](a ) to figure  [ fgillustration](b ) that a balloon drawing with uneven sub - wedges is derived from that with even sub - wedges by shrinking the drawing circles in a bottom - up fashion so that the drawing area is as small as possible @xcite . another way to differentiate",
    "the two is that for the even sub - wedge case , it is required that the position of the root of a subtree coincides with the center of the enclosing circle of the subtree .    _ aesthetic criteria _ specify graphic structures and properties of drawing , such as minimizing number of edge crossings or bends , minimizing area , and so on , but the problem of simultaneously optimizing those criteria is , in many cases , np - hard .",
    "the main aesthetic criteria on the angle sizes in balloon drawings are _ angular resolution _ , _ aspect ratio _ , and _ standard deviation of angles_. note that this paper mainly concerns the angle sizes , while it is interesting to investigate other aesthetic criteria , such as the drawing area , total edge length , etc . given a drawing of tree @xmath2 , an angle formed by the two adjacent edges incident to a common node @xmath3 is called an angle incident to node @xmath3 .",
    "note that an angle in a balloon drawing consists of two sub - wedges which belong to two different subtrees , respectively ( see figure  [ fgillustration ] ) .",
    "with respect to a node @xmath3 , the _ angular resolution _ is the smallest angle incident to node @xmath3 , the _ aspect ratio _ is the ratio of the largest angle to the smallest angle incident to node @xmath3 , and the _ standard deviation of angles _ is a statistic used as a measure of the dispersion or variation in the distribution of angles , equal to the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic mean .    the _ angular resolution _ ( resp .",
    ", _ aspect ratio _ ; _ standard deviation of angles _ ) of a drawing of @xmath2 is defined as the minimum angular resolution ( resp .",
    ", the maximum aspect ratio ; the maximum standard deviation of angles ) among all nodes in @xmath2 . the angular resolution ( resp . ,",
    "aspect ratio ; standard deviation of angles ) of a tree drawing is in the range of @xmath4 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "a tree layout with a large angular resolution can easily be identified by eyes , while a tree layout with a small aspect ratio or standard deviation of angles often enjoys a very balanced view of tree drawing .",
    "it is worthy of pointing out the fundamental difference between aspect ratio and standard deviation .",
    "the aspect ratio only concerns the deviation between the largest and the smallest angles in the drawing , while the standard deviation deals with the deviation of all the angles .    with respect to a balloon drawing of a rooted tree , changing the order in which the children of a node are listed or flipping the two sub - wedges of a subtree affects the quality of the drawing .",
    "for example , in comparison between the two balloon drawings of a tree under different tree orderings respectively shown in figures  [ fgexperiments](a ) and [ fgexperiments](b ) , we observe that the drawing in figure  [ fgexperiments](b ) displays little variations of angles , which give a very balanced drawing .",
    "hence some interesting questions arise : _ how to change the tree ordering or flip the two sub - wedge angles of each subtree such that the balloon drawing of the tree has the maximum angular resolution , the minimum aspect ratio , and the minimum standard deviation of angles ? _    throughout the rest of this paper , we let _ re _ , _ ra _ , and _ de _ denote the problems of optimizing angular resolution , aspect ratio , and standard deviation of angles , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the tractability of the re , ra , and de problems in a variety of cases , and our main results are listed in table  [ tb - results ] , in which trees with ` flexible ' ( resp . , ` fixed ' ) uneven sub - wedges refer to the case when sub - wedges of subtrees are ( resp . , are not ) allowed to flip ; a ` semi - ordered ' tree is an unordered tree where only the circular ordering of the children of each node is fixed , without specifying if this ordering is clockwise or counterclockwise in the drawing .",
    "note that a semi - ordered tree allows to flip uneven sub - wedges in the drawing , because flipping sub - wedges of a node in the bottom - up fashion of the tree does not modify the circular ordering of its children .",
    "see figure  [ fgexperiments ] for an experimental example with the drawings which achieve the optimality of ra1ra4 . in table  [ tb - results ] , with the exception of re1 and ra1 ( which were previously obtained by lin and yen in @xcite ) , all the remaining results are new .",
    "we also give 2-approximation algorithms for ra3 and ra4 , and @xmath7-approximation algorithms for de3 and de4 .",
    "finding improved approximation bounds for those intractable problems remains an interesting open question .",

    "finally , a conclusion is given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we first introduce two conventional models of balloon drawing , then define our concerned problems , and finally introduce some related problems .",
    "there exist two models in the literature for generating _ balloon drawings _ of trees .",
    "given a node @xmath3 , let @xmath12 be the radius of the drawing circle centered at @xmath3 . if we require that @xmath12 = @xmath13 for arbitrary two nodes @xmath3 and @xmath14 that are of the same depth from the root of the tree , then such a drawing is called a balloon drawing under the _ fractal model _ @xcite .",
    "the fractal drawing of a tree structure means that if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the lengths of edges at depths @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the predefined ratio ( @xmath21 ) associated with the drawing under the fractal model .",
    "clearly , edges at the same depth have the same length in a fractal drawing . unlike the fractal model",
    ", the _ subtrees with nonuniform sizes _ ( abbreviated as _ sns _ ) model @xcite allows subtrees associated with the same parent to reside in circles of different sizes ( see also figure  [ fgillustration](a ) ) , and hence the drawing based on this model often results in a clearer display on large subtrees than that under the fractal model . given",
    "a rooted ordered tree @xmath2 with @xmath22 nodes , a balloon drawing under the sns model can be obtained in @xmath10 time ( see @xcite ) in a bottom - up fashion by computing the edge length @xmath23 and the angle @xmath24 between two adjacent edges respectively according to @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see figure  [ fgillustration](a ) ) where @xmath23 is the radius of the inner circle centered at node @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the circumference of the inner circle ; @xmath29 is the radius of the outer circle enclosing all subtrees of the @xmath30-th child of @xmath27 , and @xmath31 is the radius of the outer circle enclosing all subtrees of @xmath27 ; since there exists a gap between @xmath28 and the sum of all diameters , we can distribute to every @xmath24 the gap between them evenly , which is called a free arc , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "note that the balloon drawing under the sns model is our so - called balloon drawing with even sub - wedges .",
    "a careful examination reveals that the area of a balloon drawing with even sub - wedges ( generated by the sns model ) may be reduced by shrinking the free arc between each pair of subtrees and shortening the radius of each inner circle in a bottom - up fashion @xcite , by which we can obtain a smaller - area balloon drawing with uneven sub - wedges ( e.g. , see the transformation from figure  [ fgillustration](a ) to figure  [ fgillustration](c ) ) .      in what follows",
    ", we introduce some notation , used in the rest of this paper .",
    "circular permutation _",
    "@xmath33 is expressed as : @xmath34 where for @xmath35 , @xmath36 is placed along a circle in a counterclockwise direction .",
    "note that @xmath37 is adjacent to @xmath38 ; @xmath39 denotes @xmath40 ; @xmath41 denotes @xmath42 .",
    "due to the hierarchical nature of trees and the ways the aesthetic criteria ( measures ) for balloon drawings are defined , an algorithm optimizing a _ star graph _ can be applied repeatedly to a general tree in a bottom - up fashion @xcite , yielding an optimum solution with respect to a given aesthetic criterion .",
    "thus , it suffices to consider the balloon drawing of a star graph when we discuss these problems .",
    "a star graph is characterized by a root node @xmath27 together with its @xmath22 children @xmath43 , each of which is the root of a subtree located entirely in a _",
    "wedge _ , as shown in figure  [ fgillustration](a ) ( for the even sub - wedge type ) and figure  [ fgunevennotation ] ( for the uneven sub - wedge type ) . in",

    "the ray from @xmath44 to @xmath45 further divides the associated wedge into two sub - wedges @xmath46 and @xmath47 with sizes of angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath48 and @xmath49 need not be equal in general .",
    "an _ ordering _ of @xmath44 s children is simply a circular permutation @xmath50 , in which @xmath51 for each @xmath30 .",
    "there are two dimensions of freedom affecting the quality of a balloon drawing for a star graph .",
    "the first is concerned with the ordering in which the children of the root node @xmath27 are drawn . with",
    "a given ordering , it is also possible to alter the order of occurrences of the two sub - wedges associated with each child of the root . with respect to child @xmath45 and its two sub - wedges @xmath52 and @xmath47",
    ", we use @xmath53 to denote the index of the first sub - wedge encountered in a counterclockwise traversal of the drawing . for convenience ,",

    "( or simply _ assignment _ ) . as shown in figure  [ fgunevennotation ] , the sequence of sub - wedges encountered along the cycle centered at @xmath27 in a counterclockwise direction can be expressed as : @xmath57    if @xmath58 for each @xmath59 , then the drawing is said to be of _ even sub - wedge type _ ; otherwise , it is of _ uneven sub - wedge type_. as mentioned earlier , the order of the two sub - wedges associated with a child ( along the counterclockwise direction ) affects the quality of a drawing in the uneven sub - wedge case . for the case of uneven sub - wedge type ,",
    "if the assignment @xmath60 is given _ a priori _ , then the drawing is said to be of _ fixed _ uneven sub - wedge type ; otherwise , of _ flexible _ uneven sub - wedge type ( i.e. , @xmath60 is a design parameter ) .",

    "we denote by @xmath72 the sum of products of sub - wedges , which can be expressed as : @xmath73 we are now in a position to define the re , ra and de problems in table  [ tb - results ] for four cases ( c1 , c2 , c3 , and c4 ) in a precise manner .",
    "the four cases depend on whether the circular permutation @xmath61 and the assignment @xmath60 in a balloon drawing are fixed ( i.e. , given a priori ) or flexible ( i.e. , design parameters ) .",
    "for example , case c3 allows an arbitrary ordering of the children ( i.e. , the tree is unordered ) , but the relative positions of the two sub - wedges associated with a child node are fixed ( i.e. , flipping is not allowed ) .",
    "the remaining three cases are easy to understand .",
