    "the hadronic abundances observed in the final state of heavy - ion collisions are settled when @xmath2 drops to @xmath29 , i.e. the degrees of freedom drop to @xmath36 .",
    "meanwhile the changing in the particle number with the changing in the collision energy is given by the baryo - chemical potential @xmath3 , the energy that produces no additional work , i.e. the stage of vanishing free energy , gives the entropy at the chemical equilibrium . at the chemical freezeout ,",
    "the equilibrium entropy represents the amount of energy that ca nt be used to produce additional work . in this context , the entropy is defined as the degree of sharing and spreading the energy inside the system that is in chemical equilibrium .",
    "regarding to the sharp peak of the @xmath37 ratio at sps energy  @xcite , we still face the problem that the thermal models ( hrgm ) , on the one hand side , describe very well the freezeout parameters at each collision energy individually , i.e. they are assumed to be able to reproduce all particle ratios . on the other hand",
    ", we find that such a sharp peak ca nt be reproduced by the thermal models  @xcite . indeed , we find that the @xmath37 ratio at the sis , ags and low sps energies can be reproduced by the thermal models .",
    "but a large overestimation is to be observe at top sps and all rhic energies .",
    "if we assume that the uncertainty in the experimentally estimated ( or fitted by the thermal models ) @xmath37 ratio is small , then one might think that this experimental observation might indicate to some critical phenomena , which we do nt include in the thermal models .",
    "one way to avoid this dilemma might be assuming two separate conditions for the freezeout parameters .",
    "one of them is to be applied at small @xmath3 , where we ca nt distinguish between the freezeout and the deconfinement .",
    "the other one should be able to describe the freezeout parameters at large @xmath3 .",
    "both conditions should be able to reproduce the particle ratios at all collision energies .",
    "the region , i.e. @xmath3-values , where the two conditions intersect hopefully will be corresponding to the collision energy , at which the sharp peak of the @xmath37 ratio has been observed ."
