    "these notes are about how the _ sp theory of intelligence _ and its embodiment in the _ sp machine _ may help to translate that vision into reality .",
    "i ll first introduce the sp concepts briefly and then try to show how they may facilitate some of the possibilities described in _",
    "the sp theory , which has been under development for several years , aims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence , mainstream computing and human perception and cognition , with information compression as a unifying theme .",
    "the theory is conceived as an abstract brain - like system that , in an ` input ' perspective , may receive ` new ' information via its senses , and compress some or all of it to create ` old ' information , as illustrated schematically in figure [ sp_input_perspective_figure ] . in the theory ,",
    "information compression is the mechanism both for the learning and organisation of knowledge and for pattern recognition , reasoning , problem - solving , and more .        in the sp theory ,",
    "all kinds of knowledge are represented with _ patterns _ : arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions .",
    "a key part of the system is a concept of _ multiple alignment _ , like that shown in figure [ parsing_1_figure ] .",
    "the sp theory is realised in a computer model , sp70 , which may be regarded as a first version of the sp machine .",
    "it is envisaged that the sp computer model will provide the basis for the development of a high - parallel , open - source version of the sp machine , as shown schematically in figure [ sp_machine_figure ] .",
    "this will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it .",
    "the sp system provides a model for several aspects of computing and cognition , including unsupervised learning , concepts of computing , aspects of mathematics and logic , the representation of knowledge , natural language processing , pattern recognition , several kinds of reasoning , information storage and retrieval , planning and problem solving , and aspects of neuroscience and of human perception and cognition @xcite .",
    "there is a relatively full account of the sp system in @xcite , an extended overview in @xcite , an account of its existing and expected benefits and applications in @xcite , a description of its foundations in @xcite , and an introduction to the system in @xcite .",

    "the sp computer model is able to discover generative grammars from data , including segmental structure , classes of structure , and abstract patterns .",
    "but in developing the sp system , a radical reorganisation has been needed to meet the goal of simplifying and integrating concepts across artificial intelligence , mainstream computing , and human perception and cognition . unlike the earlier models",
    ", multiple alignment is central in the workings of the sp computer model , including unsupervised learning .",
    "a bonus of the new structure is potential for the unsupervised learning of class hierarchies , part - whole hierarchies , and discontinuous dependencies in data .",
    "the emphasis on unsupervised learning in the sp programme of research is because of evidence that human learning , including the learning of natural languages , does not depend on the provision of a ` teacher ' , or anything equivalent  although such assistance may be helpful .",
    "a strength of the sp system is that it can discover significant entities , classes of entity , and other structures in data , not merely statistical associations between pre - established structures .",
    "an important idea in the sp programme is the ` donsvic ' principle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.2 ) : the conjecture , supported by evidence , that information compression is the key to the discovery of ` natural ' structures , meaning the kinds of things that people naturally recognise , such as words , objects , and classes of objects .",
