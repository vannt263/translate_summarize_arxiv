    "in this article , we overview the dark parity violation @xcite , which means the parity violation induced by a dark gauge boson .",
    "the dark gauge boon ( we use @xmath2 for its notation ) is a hypothetical particle with a very small mass and a small coupling to the standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "there are multiple motivations for the dark gauge interaction ( or dark force ) including the dark matter related ones , but we will focus only on the @xmath3 motivation here .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on the subject . )",
    "we will first discuss the relation of the @xmath3 and the dark gauge interaction , and briefly overview the typical dark force searches in the labs .",
    "then we will discuss the dark force searches through the low - energy parity test .",
    "the @xmath3 issue has been always an important motivation and the constraint for the new physics .",
    "currently , there is a @xmath4 c.l .",
    "discrepancy between the measurement and the sm prediction in the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is one of the major motivations for a new light gauge boson too as it can contribute to the @xmath3 through a loop - correction [ fig .",
    "[ fig : g-2a ] ] . unlike the most other motivations , it is independent of the unknown dark matter properties , and it is also independent of the @xmath2 decay branching ratios .",
    "figure [ fig : g-2b ] ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows the parameter space of the dark photon along with the @xmath3 favored parameter space ( green band ) as well as the constraints from @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    to explain the @xmath7 deviation , which is a positive quantity , the @xmath2 coupling to the muons should be vector - coupling dominated because it would give the right sign for the @xmath2 contribution to the @xmath7 to explain the discrepancy , while the axial coupling would give the wrong sign , the negative contribution to the @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 should have either only a vector coupling or a dominant vector coupling plus a small axial coupling .",
    "there are some dark force models corresponding to each case .",
    "one is the dark photon model @xcite , which has only the vector coupling at the leading order .",
    "another is a relatively new model , the dark @xmath0 model @xcite , which has the vector coupling and a small axial coupling .",
    "their interactions are given by @xmath8 z'_\\mu \\label{eq : darkz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the parametrizations of the effective @xmath13 mixing and @xmath14 mixing , respectively .",
    "both models commonly assume the kinetic mixing between the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the sm particles have zero charges under the new gauge group @xmath16 .",
    "the gauge boson @xmath2 of the @xmath16 can still couple to the sm fermions through the mixing with the sm gauge bosons . depending on the details of the higgs sector ,",
    "the physical eigenstate of the @xmath2 can mix only with the photon ( dark photon model ) or with both the photon and the @xmath0 boson ( dark @xmath0 model ) .",
    "because of the @xmath0 coupling , the @xmath2 in the dark @xmath0 model inherits some properties of the @xmath0 boson such as the parity violating nature . to emphasize this @xmath0 coupling ,",
    "the @xmath2 of this model was named the _",
    "dark @xmath0 boson_. roughly speaking , the dark photon is a heavier version of the photon , and the dark @xmath0 is a lighter version of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "dark photon vs. dark @xmath0 .",
    "the dark @xmath0 is a dark photon with more general couplings . ]",
    "one of the effects of the dark @xmath0 over the dark photon is that the relevant parameter space for the @xmath2 is extended from 2d to 3d ( see the illustration in fig .",
    "[ fig : darkphotondarkz ] ) . in the dark photon model ,",
    "we need only 2 parameters ( @xmath17 and @xmath11 ) , and all relevant couplings of the @xmath2 are determined by the @xmath11 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : darkphoton ] ) ] . in the dark @xmath0 model",
    ", we have another parameter ( @xmath12 ) , which describes the @xmath14 mixing .",
    "the coupling is given by the combination of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : darkz ] ) ] .",
    "thus , one can view the dark @xmath0 as a dark photon with more general couplings , and the dark photon as a special case of the dark @xmath0 in the @xmath18 limit .",
    "because of the new coupling , some experiments that are irrelevant to the dark photon searches are relevant to the dark @xmath0 searches @xcite .",
    "they include the low - energy parity test , which we will discuss later in this paper .",
    "there are many ongoing and proposed searches for the dark force in the labs around the world @xcite .",
    "the typical searches exploit the small @xmath2 coupling to the sm particles rather than the coupling to the dark matter particles .",
    "a particularly attractive feature about the dark force is that it is one of the rare new physics scenarios that can be tested / discovered at the low - energy experimental facilities , which are typically built for nuclear or hadronic physics .",
    "it is possible because the dark force carrier @xmath2 is roughly of gev scale , which is about 1000 times smaller than the typical new physics scale ( tev scale ) . if a new particle is of tev scale , the lhc has probably the best chance to find it , but the dark force carrier is of about proton mass scale , and it can be searched for in many low - energy labs .    figure  [ fig : darkphoton ] ( from refs .",
    "@xcite with a slight modification ) shows the parameter space of the dark photon with the current bounds .",
    "the bounds come from the electron @xcite and muon @xcite anomalous magnetic moments , fixed target experiments @xcite , beam dump experiments @xcite , meson decays @xcite , @xmath19 collision experiments @xcite .",
    "it is quite clear that with the most recent experimental dilepton bump searches along with the @xmath6 ( @xmath20 c.l . ) , the whole @xmath3 favored parameter region ( green band ) is practically excluded .",
    "thus one of the leading motivations for the light dark gauge boson got seriously weakened .",
    "partly because of this reason , an invisibly - decaying dark photon has been spotlighted recently .",
    "it assumes the existence of a very light dark matter ( @xmath21 ) of @xmath22 so that the @xmath2 can dominantly decay into the invisible particles .",
    "different experiments apply for this scenario .",
    "figure  [ fig : darkphotoninvisible ] ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows the parameter space of the invisibly - decaying dark photon with the current bounds .",
    "it is basically the missing energy search .",
    "the ags @xmath23 + nothing experiments @xcite and the babar @xmath24 + nothing experiments @xcite constrain the parameter space .",
    "there may be more constraints from the light dark matter scattering at detectors in the beam - dump experiments @xcite , but they depend on the dark matter coupling , which is a unknown parameter .",
    "we can see some of the parameter region ( @xmath25 and around @xmath26 ) survive the constraints .",
    "these remaining parameter space may be explored by some proposed missing energy search experiments such as the darklight @xcite and sps beam - dump experiment @xcite .    if we take the dark @xmath0 model , things are a little different .",
    "a visibly - decaying dark @xmath0 has similar bounds as the dark photon in the shown parameter ranges [ fig .",
    "[ fig : darkphoton ] ] . for an invisibly - decaying dark @xmath0 , in the presence of the light dark matter particles , because of an additional term for the @xmath14 mass mixing , there can be a sizable interference between the kinetic mixing ( @xmath11 ) contribution and the mass mixing ( @xmath12 ) contribution in the flavor - changing meson decays .",
    "the @xmath23 + nothing constraints can be much weaker than that of the dark photon case [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : darkzinvisible ] from ref .",
    "now , we discuss the dark force searches through the low - energy parity test @xcite .",
    "the dark @xmath0 modifies the effective lagrangian of the weak neutral current scattering , _ eff & = & - j^_nc ( ^2_w ) j_^nc ( ^2_w ) + g_f & & ( 1 + ^2 ) g_f + ^2_w & & ( 1 - ) ^2_w where @xmath27 is the momentum transfer of the two neutral currents , and @xmath28 is a reparametrization of the @xmath12 with @xmath29 .",
    "one of the things these formulas indicate is these shifts are sensitive only to the low-@xmath1 ( low momentum transfer ) .",
    "thus , the dark @xmath0 effectively changes the weak neutral current scattering , including the effective weinberg angle , which describes the parity violation , but only for the low momentum transfer .    figure  [ fig : runningweinberg ] ( from ref .",
    "@xcite with a slight modification ) shows an example of how the effective @xmath30 changes with @xmath27 in the presence of a dark @xmath0 for @xmath31 ( blue band ) , @xmath32 ( red band ) cases .",
    "this example is actually for the invisibly - decaying dark @xmath0 .",
    "although the details are not very important for our discussions , these masses are those excluded in the ( invisibly - decaying ) dark photon case as a solution to the @xmath3 anomaly , but in the dark @xmath0 , they are saved because of an additional @xmath12 term , which predicts the specific parameter values giving the colored bands .",
    "the deviations appear only in the low @xmath27 values , roughly @xmath33 .",
    "they never appears in the high @xmath27 values relevant to the high - energy experiments . in other words , we need low - energy experiments to see the dark @xmath0 mediated scattering effects .    for the low-@xmath1 parity tests , one can use the atomic parity violation in cs @xcite , ra@xmath34 ion @xcite or the low-@xmath1 polarized electron scattering experiments e158 @xcite , qweak @xcite , moller @xcite and mesa @xcite .",
    "the possible deviations due to the dark @xmath0 can be large enough to be observed with the future experiments .",
    "deep inelastic scattering experiments such as pvdis @xcite and solid @xcite may be also useful for the heavier @xmath2 . the parity tests , measuring the weinberg angle , are independent of the @xmath2 decay branching ratios , which makes them an excellent probe of the dark force for both visibly - decaying and invisibly - decaying @xmath2 .    for some works on the low-@xmath1 parity violations induced by a pseudoscalar particle ,",
    "see refs .",
    "the dark gauge interaction has been being searched for in various ways .",
    "( i ) the @xmath35 of the electron and muon . especially , the @xmath4 c.l .",
    "deviation in the @xmath3 can be explained by the dark gauge boson ( the green band in the parameter space ) .",
    "( ii ) the dilepton resonance search is probably the most popular and direct search of the dark gauge interaction , and it practically excludes the green band with the most recent data .",
    "( iii ) the missing energy search requires very light dark sector particles , but some parts of the green band survive .",
    "( iv ) the low - energy parity test , including the atomic parity violation and the polarized electron scatterings are simply another excellent search of the dark force , and it is independent of the @xmath2 decay branching ratios .",
    "it requires the presence of an axial coupling of the @xmath2 though as in the dark @xmath0 model .",
