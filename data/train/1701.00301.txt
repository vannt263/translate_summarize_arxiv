    "recent progress in the study of optical models with deliberately incorporated loss and gain has led to a new subject in optics that can be termed the @xmath0-symmetric optics @xcite . as is well known ,",
    "the inclusion in the model either the loss or gain is directly related to non - hermitian hamiltonians corresponding to the scattering setup . due to non - hermiticity its eigenvalues are , generically , complex , however , there is a specific situation when in spite of the non - hermitian nature of the hamiltonian , its eigenvalues can be real @xcite .",
    "this situation emerges when the hamiltonian has the so - called @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "such a symmetry occurs if the hamiltonian is symmetric under the combined action of space refection @xmath1 and time reversal @xmath2 operators . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues can be real in some frequency ( energy ) region .    in application to optics , the @xmath0-symmetric scattering setup can be arranged @xcite with the use of optical attenuation and amplifications in such a way that the complex refractive index distribution obeys the relation , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this condition implies that real part of the refractive index is even function of position , @xmath4 , while its imaginary part is antisymmetric , @xmath5 . in the scattering problem ,",
    "one of the approaches is based on the transfer matrix @xmath6 that allows one to describe all transport properties in dependence on the model parameters .",
    "thus , the attention can be shifted from the symmetric properties of a hamiltonian to those of the transfer matrix .",
    "the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix that corresponds to the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian , undergo the transition from real to complex eigenvalues under the change of frequency .",
    "this effect is known in literature as `` breaking the @xmath0-symmetry '' .",
    "note , however , that this term does not mean the breaking of any symmetry neither in the corresponding hamiltonian nor in the transfer matrix @xmath6 .",
    "actually , by `` breaking the @xmath0-symmetry '' one means an existence of two regions in the frequency domain , with either real or complex eigenvalues of the transfer matrix . at the point of transition from one region to another it was found that the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix coincide ; these points are known in the literature as the `` exceptional points '' ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the interest in the @xmath0-symmetric optical systems is due to anomalous properties of the transport characteristics , that are predicted and observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "one of such properties is the so - called _ unidirectional reflectivity _ emerging at specific values of the frequency . for this values",
    "one of the reflectances , either the left or right one , vanishes while the other remains finite .",
    "typically , at such points the transmittance @xmath7 equals unity which is a generic property of the transfer matrix @xmath6 . if in addition the phase shift of the wave function after passing the scattering part is an integer modulo @xmath8 , in such a case one can speak of a non - visibility of the scattering setup .",
    "in our recent paper @xcite it was found that for the chain of @xmath9 bilayers with the balanced loss / gain terms , the unidirectional reflectivity can emerge even when the scattering structure is a non-@xmath0-symmetric . in this case the frequencies for which one of the reflectances vanishes , are not those corresponding to the exceptional points .",
    "for this reason , below we refer to such points as the u - points , without any reference to the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix . recently",
    ", the possibility to observe the real spectra in non-@xmath0-symmetric models has been discussed in view of synthesizing complex potentials within the context of optical supersymmetry @xcite ( see , also , @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of our present study is to demonstrate , both analytically and numerically , an emergence of the so - called _ double - sided unidirectional reflectivity _ that takes place in the scattering model consisting of two layers . in this model",
    "the impedances characterizing the scattering part are different from those describing the leads .",
    "such a non - perfect matching has unexpectedly resulted in a new effect of the reflection properties . for the perfect",
    "matching with the leads ( in the case of no loss / gain ) , the reflectance of the bilayer with balanced loss / gain vanishes at one side of the setup only , either the right or left one .",
    "we have found that the breaking of the perfect matching gives rise to an interchange of the left and right vanishing reflectivity when changing the wave frequency .",
    "specifically , the left unidirectional reflectivity is transformed into the right one when the frequency crosses specific values .",
    "this effect depends entirely on the relation between the parameter characterizing the breaking of the perfect matching , and the parameter controlling the balanced gain and loss .",
    "this effect of the double - sided unidirectional reflectivity may be used in the experimental realizations of anomalous properties of scattering in optical devices .",
    "the model describes the perpendicular propagation of an electromagnetic wave of frequency @xmath10 through a one - dimensional bilayer consisting of dielectric @xmath11 and @xmath12 slabs and connected to dielectric left , @xmath13 , and right , @xmath14 , perfect leads , see fig .",

    "the loss and gain in the layers are incorporated via complex permittivities @xmath18 , while the magnetic permeabilities @xmath19 are assumed to be real and positive constants .",
