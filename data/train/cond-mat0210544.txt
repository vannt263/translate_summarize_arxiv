    "@xcite has made it clear that near a feshbach resonance the coherence between atoms and molecules can have a profound role in the dynamics of an atomic bose - einstein condensate . as a result",
    ", it has become an urgent problem to understand from first principles how to properly incorporate the possible coherence between atoms and molecules into the theory of an interacting bose gas . in the last four years",
    "important progress towards a solution of this problem has been made by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that a fully satisfactory theory , which obeys all the requirements that on physical grounds can _ a priori _ be imposed upon the theory , still needs to be developed .",
    "it is with this goal in mind that the present contribution has been written .",
    "a first requirement for the theory is that it is based on an adequate microscopic description of a feshbach resonance .",
    "feshbach resonances are already known for a long time in nuclear physics @xcite , but have only more recently been predicted to occur in ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the defining feature of such resonances is that they can only occur in a multi - channel scattering problem .",
    "more precisely , a feshbach resonance occurs when the kinetic energy of the particles in the incoming open channel is equal to the energy of a bound state in a closed channel that is ( weakly ) coupled to the incoming channel .",
    "it is important for our purposes that the physics of a feshbach resonance is quite different from the physics of a resonance in a single - channel scattering problem with a bound state near the continuum threshold of the particles .",
    "this can most easily be seen from the fact that in the latter case the bound state in the incoming channel is only very weakly bound and the extent of its wave function is , therefore , always much larger than the range of the interaction between the particles . for a feshbach resonance",
    "the extent of the bound state wave function is generally of the same size as the range of the interactions , because it usually corresponds to a deeply bound state in the potential of another and closed channel . as a result also",
    "the quantum numbers of the bound state are different from the quantum numbers of the incoming particles , which is clearly not the case for the single - channel scattering problem .",
    "a second requirement follows from the fact that the many - body theory based on the microscopic description envisaged above is free of ultra - violet divergences at any level of approximation , and in particular , for both the normal and superfluid phases of the atomic bose gas .",
    "the reason for this is that microscopically the interatomic interactions responsible for the feshbach resonance are determined by short - range potentials , which cut off all the momentum integrals that arise when we diagramatically include the effects of the interactions . as a result the desired effective atom - molecule hamiltonian of the gas can contain only terms with coefficients that are finite and cut - off independent .",
    "moreover , the coefficients are determined by only a small number of experimental parameters such as the position and the width of the feshbach resonance , for instance .",
    "the most crucial additional requirement on the effective atom - molecule hamiltonian is that it must exactly reproduce the two - body physics of the atomic gas , _",
    "i.e. _ , by solving the hamiltonian in the hilbert space of two atoms we must recover the correct scattering amplitude of the atoms and also the correct binding energy and quantum numbers of the molecule .",
    "note that in this manner the molecular properties are exactly incorporated at the quantum level , which is important for several reasons .",
    "first , the theory can now be applied both in the normal and in the superfluid phase of the gas .",
    "second , we are not restricted to a mean - field description of the gas and are now also able to systematically study fluctuation effects , which we have recently shown to be of importance under the experimental conditions of interest @xcite .",
    "finally , the theory can be immediately generalized to atomic fermi gases near a feshbach resonance , which are of great current interest in view of the prospect of creating new neutral bcs superfluids @xcite .",
    "also in this case fluctuation effects are known to be essential @xcite and can only be accounted for after the molecular properties are exactly incorporated in the quantum theory .    as",
    "already implicitly mentioned , the effective atom - molecule hamiltonian is in first instance the most convenient way to arrive at a mean - field description of the gas . in the case of a bose - einstein condensed atomic gas , an exact property of the system",
    "is that it has a gapless excitation .",
    "therefore , any physically reasonable mean - field theory must have the same property . from a fundamental point of view",
    "the gapless excitation is due to the fact that a bose - einstein condensate spontaneously breaks the global @xmath1 symmetry associated with the conservation of the total number of atoms .",
    "for the mean - field theory to fulfill this requirement automatically it must be formulated such that it does not contain an anomalous density or pairing field @xcite . including an anomalous density in general leads to a double counting of the interaction effects and ,",
    "therefore , destroys the gaplessness of the mean - field theory .    in agreement with the above discussion",
    ", the paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we start from a microscopic hamiltonian for an atomic bose gas with a feshbach resonance and derive from this a bare atom - molecule theory . to make contact with the experimentally known parameters of the feshbach resonance",
    ", we then carry out in a complete ladder summation to arrive at the desired effective atom - molecule hamiltonian that incorporates exactly all the relevant two - atom physics . in",
    "we show in particular how the correct properties of the molecule are recovered . after",
    "that we discuss in how to arrive at the simplest mean - field theory that is appropriate at the low temperatures of interest experimentally , where the thermal component of the gas can be neglected .",
    "we finally end in with our conclusions .",
    "without loss of generality we can consider the simplest situation in which a feshbach resonance arises , _",
    "i.e. _ , we consider a homogeneous gas of identical atoms with two internal states denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the atoms in the two states interact via the potentials @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the state @xmath6 has an energy @xmath7 with respect to the state @xmath2 due to the zeeman interaction with the magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "the coupling between the two states , which from the atomic physics point of view is due to the hyperfine interaction , is denoted by @xmath9 . putting everything together our microscopic hamiltonian",
    "is thus given by @xmath10 \\psiup ( \\bx ) \\nonumber \\\\        & & + \\int d { \\bf x }          \\psiddown ( \\bx ) \\left [       -\\frac{\\hbar^2 { \\bf        \\nabla}^2}{2 m } + \\frac{\\delta \\mu b}{2 }                       + \\half \\int d \\bx ' \\psiddown ( \\bx ' )        v_{\\downarrow \\downarrow } ( \\bx-\\bx ' ) \\psidown ( \\bx ' )      \\right ] \\psidown ( \\bx ) \\nonumber \\\\        & & + \\half \\int d \\bx \\int d \\bx ' \\left [ \\psidup ( \\bx ) \\psidup ( \\bx ' )           v_{\\uparrow \\downarrow } ( \\bx-\\bx ' ) \\psidown ( \\bx ' ) \\psidown ( \\bx )           + { \\rm       h.c . }",

    "only a single bound state contributes and this operator has the property that @xmath14 the properly normalized and symmetrized bound state wave function in the potential @xmath11 , which we choose to be real for simplicity , obeys the schrdinger equation @xmath15 \\chi_{\\rm m } ( \\bx ) = e_{\\rm m } \\chi_{\\rm m }    ( \\bx).\\ ] ] after the hubbard - stratonovich transformation we obtain the bare hamiltonian for the coupled atom - molecule system .",

    "the molecule - molecule and atom - molecule interactions also follow from the above procedure but will be neglected in the following , since under the experimental conditions of interest @xcite the density of molecules is very small .",
    "for an the application of the hamiltonian in to realistic atomic gases we have to include all two - body processes , because at the relevant low densities three and more - body processes can in first instance be neglected .",
    "these are most conveniently included by a renormalization of the bare potential @xmath18 and the bare coupling @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the molecules acquire a self energy .",
    "the interaction potential of the atoms in principle renormalizes to the many - body t(ransition ) matrix .",

    "due to the fact that the scattering takes places in a medium the many - body t matrix also depends on the center - of - mass momentum @xmath27 .",
    "the energy of a single atom is equal to @xmath28 . in the hartree - fock approximation the energy in principle",
    "also contains a mean - field correction which we neglect in first instance .",
    "we come back to this point in , however .",
    "the diagrammatic representation of is given in .",
    "for temperatures not too close to the critical temperature we are allowed to neglect the many - body effects @xcite , and reduces to the lippmann - schwinger equation for the two - body t matrix . the effective interaction between the atoms thus becomes @xmath29 .",
    "for the realistic conditions of the atomic gases under consideration here , _",
    "i.e. _ , small external momenta and energies , the two - body t matrix is independent of momentum and energy and equal to @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the @xmath0-wave scattering length of the potential @xmath32 . therefore , we conclude that the renormalization of this potential is given by @xmath33    the renormalization of the bare atom - molecule coupling is determined by the equation @xmath34 }                   { z-\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}/2+\\bk'}-\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}/2-\\bk ' } }      g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}(\\bk')~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is presented diagramatically in .",

    ". _ @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , the density of states is found to be equal to @xmath78 ^ 2        + ( g^4 m^3/4 \\pi^2 \\hbar^6 )        ( \\hbar \\omega - \\epsilon_{\\bk}/2 ) } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and can be shown to obey the sum rule @xmath79 we thus conclude that the wave function renormalization factor of the molecules is given by @xmath80 $ ] , which close to resonance is much smaller than one .",
    "physically , this implies that in this case the wave function of the molecule is strongly affected by the interaction with the continuum in the incoming channel and contains only with an amplitude @xmath81 the wave function @xmath82 of the bound state in the closed channel .    the molecular density of states changes when an atomic bose - einstein condensate is present , due to the mean - field interactions with the condensate .",
    "in particular , in this case we expect that the two - atom continuum part of the density of states is less important because of the mean - field barrier that the two colliding condensate atoms have to overcome .",
    "mathematically this comes about since , to include the hartree - fock mean - field shift of the energy of the atoms , we have to replace in @xmath83 by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 denotes the hartree - fock self energy of the noncondensed atoms due to their interaction with the condensate .",
    "the mean - field shift of the thermal atoms leads to a change of the bound state energy as well . in equilibrium",
    "we estimate the magnitude of this shift by approximately calculating the self energy @xmath85 from @xmath86~,\\ ] ] for a given condensate density @xmath87 . in this manner",
    "we have calculated the mean - field shift of the bound - state energy as a function of the magnetic field for the feshbach resonance at in the @xmath88 state of @xmath89rb . in the results of this calculation",
    "are presented for two experimentally relevant condensate densities , namely @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath91 @xcite . as expected , the shift of the bound - state energy is largest for the highest condensate density and decreases away from the resonance .",
    "although is only a first approximation to calculate the hartree - fock mean - field energy , shows that the shift in the bound - state energy is significant . a more thorough calculation of the mean - field effect on the bound - state energy and also on the position of the resonance",
    "is postponed to future work . with respect to this remark ,",
    "it should be noted that , since the retardation time of the interaction is only of the order of @xmath93 , the mean - field effects are not instantaneous .",
    "therefore , the relevance of the mean - field shifts to nonequilibrium situations , such as in the recent experiments with time - dependent detuning @xcite , is also subject to further research .",
    "the mean - field theory for the coupled atomic and molecular condensates is found by taking the expectation value of .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the temperatures are so low that the thermal cloud of the bose gas can be neglected .",
    "it is , however , straightforward to include the mean - field effects of the thermal cloud in the same manner as in the by now standard popov theory for weakly - interacting bose gases .",
    "furthermore , we neglect for simplicity the effect of the hartree - fock energy shift on the two - atom continuum and the molecular binding energy .",
    "the resulting mean - field equations are then given by @xmath94   \\psi_{\\rm m } ( t ) + g \\psi_{\\rm a}^2 ( t)~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in agreement with our remarks in the introduction the above equations contains no anomalous density or pairing field .",
    "one way to understand the reason for this is that the effects of the anomalous density are already included by using the renormalized couplings and including the molecular self energy . including these effects again would lead to double counting problems and , therefore , to a theory that is not gapless . another way to understand",
    "it is that equation is explicitly @xmath1 invariant and the gaplessness of the theory is thus automatically guaranteed .",
    "a crucial ingredient in our formulation is the ( nonlocal ) term proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "it is this term that incorporates the correct binding energy of the molecules for negative detuning , and their lifetime if the detuning is positive . in principle",
    "this term must be treated as follows . using the green s function in",
    "we find that the wave function of the molecular condensate is , for time - independent detuning , given by @xmath96 where the fourier transform of @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\omega        } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result can then be substituted in the equation for the atomic condensate wave function , which can now be easily solved numerically as we will show in future work .",
    "we have derived from first principles an effective quantum field theory for feshbach resonant interactions in atomic bose gases . in future work",
    "we intend to apply this quantum field theory to study various equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of ultracold atomic gases near a feshbach resonance .",
    "this will include a further study of the mean - field shifts of the bound - state energy and the position of the resonance , as well as the study of the bec / bcs crossover in the superfluid phase of a two - component fermi gas @xcite .",
    "moreover , we are now in a position to also study the normal phase for both for bosonic and fermionic gases . in order to apply the theory also to the recent pulse experiments with bose - einstein condensates of @xmath89rb @xcite",
    ", we need to include a detuning that varies rapidly with time .",
    "this leads to some technical complications with the proper treatment of our nonlocal term that remain to be resolved .",
    "with respect to the latter experiments we also want to further study the importance of the quantum evaporation process , which previous work has shown not to be negligible @xcite .",
