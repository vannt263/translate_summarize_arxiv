    "macroscopic magnetic experiments , which are sensitive to thermodynamic averages over the sample s volume , have been a fundamental tool in the research of type - ii superconductors . in particular",
    ", one can obtain information on the interaction between flux tubes ( vortices ) and the underlying pinning structure . within the framework of bean s critical state model@xcite ( csm )",
    "the experimental data can be processed with remarkable ease .",
    "thus , elementary mathematical manipulations are usually enough for getting important material parameters as the critical current density @xmath2 .",
    "being a phenomenological approach , the csm is supported by _ mesoscopic _",
    "theories,@xcite which deal with the complex vortex interactions .",
    "the physical basis is that a maximum gradient in the density of vortices is allowed by the underlying pinning structure .",
    "this gradient is nothing but the critical value of the coarse - grained current density . when more and more vortices are pushed inwards by the external field pressure , avalanche processes are induced as @xmath2",
    "is exceeded , which relax to new metastable structures with maximum current density .",
    "overdamped relaxation is typically assumed , which relates to the fact that external drive variations occur slowly as compared to the superconductor s diffusion time .    from the macroscopic point of view",
    ", this course of events may be modelled by the use of the maxwell equations and a material law in the form of a vertical @xmath3 characteristic ( see fig.[fig : delta ] ) .",
    "any _ dc _ current density may flow within the sample in the absence of electric field for the range @xmath4 .",
    "corresponding to a very high level of dissipation for @xmath5 , magnetic field changes are introduced by electric field values along the vertical line .",
    "eventually , a new _ dc _ state is reached when @xmath6 comes to zero again , and we have @xmath7 in those regions of the sample affected by changes .",
    "for one dimensional problems with parallel vortices , the actual behavior of @xmath6 may be skipped over , and many works on the critical state do not even mention this quantity .",
    "in fact , the solution of the csm consists of choosing among one of the possible states for the current density @xmath8 according to the rule that _ any electromotive force due to external field variations induces the maximum current density flow_. nevertheless , as soon as multidimensional situations are considered ( nonparallel vortices ) , the problem becomes much more difficult because an infinite number of possible states for the critical current density @xmath9 are allowed .",
    "several approximations have been introduced over the last decades for dealing with such a situation .    in the early 70 s",
    "the consideration of simultaneous application of longitudinal magnetic field and transport current along type - ii wires led to the concept of flux compression between mutually perpendicular vortices .",
    "this approach allowed to explain the so - called _ paramagnetic effect _ related to the increase of magnetic flux towards the center of the sample and basically neglects the flux cutting events between nonparallel vortices.@xcite    however , in the following decade , flux cutting was recognized to be the essential mechanism for a reasonable understanding of rotation field experiments@xcite and gave place to the concept of double critical state model@xcite ( dcsm ) . in this approach ,",
    "the so - called parallel critical current density @xmath10 and perpendicular critical current density @xmath11 were introduced .",
    "@xmath10 relates to the flux cutting threshold , whereas @xmath11 stands for the _ conventional _ depinning current density .",
    "recently , a more sophisticated approach was introduced , the so - called _ two - velocity hydrodynamic model_.@xcite essentially , this theory incorporates the flux pinning and cutting phenomena within the framework of flux line lattices ( flls ) which consist of two vortex subsystems , moving at different speeds .",
    "this physical description relates to the mathematical need of a discontinuity in the velocity field in order to allow for crossing events .",
    "finite element based models are also available,@xcite which allow to compute magnetization properties of many non - ideal geometries of crucial importance in the field of applied superconductivity .",
    "these are typically in the form of variational statements and , to our knowledge have been exploited for scalar @xmath3 relations ( i.e. : @xmath12 is assumed ) .    a variational approximation to the critical state",
    "was also suggested in ref .",
    ", by a guessed _ minimum flux change _ criterion .",
    "the authors of that work argued that , in certain conditions ( @xmath12 ) , successive field penetration profiles in the magnetization process could be obtained by minimizing the squared flux density variation for constant current density modulus .",
    "in the theory presented in this paper we propose a generalization , which incorporates a vector _ vertical _ @xmath13 law , but in the manner of bean s approach still avoids the explicit use of induced electric fields .",
    "a principle is provided for determining the critical current density vector @xmath14 within the sample , subsequent to the breaking of equilibrium by the external drive .",
    "we keep the main physical ingredient that infinite dissipation occurs if some critical value is exceeded . as",
    "this value is a vector quantity a new mathematical framework is required , so as to find the actual critical state in which the system settles subsequent to a specific manipulation .",
    "in this section we will define the macroscopic fields involved in the csm and their relation to measurable quantities .",
    "our work has been developed within the assumption that the sample s response is dominated by the _ irreversible _ contribution .",
    "this means that the equilibrium response of the fll in the absence of pinning centers is neglected . for global magnetization measurements in which the integrated magnetic moment of the sample is measured ,",
    "this is a very good approximation , unless for weak pinning specimens ( see ref .",
    "and references therein ) .",
    "then , the coarse - grained electrodynamics if formulated in terms of    * the _ flux density _ @xmath15 within the sample is the average of the microscopic field intensity @xmath16 . * the _ magnetic field _ @xmath17 , in the absence of equilibrium magnetization , is linearly connected to @xmath18 by @xmath19 . *",
    "the averaged current density may be calculated from @xmath20 . * the electric field",
    "can be evaluated by @xmath21 .",
    "finally , the connection to observable quantities is done by characterizing the external field sources and the sample s response .    *",
    "on neglecting finite size effects , the magnetic source ( @xmath22 ) enters as a boundary condition for the flux density at the surface of the sample .",
    "the tangential component is continuous @xmath23 . * then , the measured magnetic moment of the sample per unit volume is @xmath24 .    for further use",
    "we notice that , in the case of one independent variable , ampere s law allows the following representation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angle between the magnetic field and the @xmath27 axis , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are unit vectors respectively directed along @xmath30 or perpendicular .    ) , height=192 ]",
    "in this section we show that bean s ansatz for parallel fll s allows a _ geometrical _ interpretation , which one can straightforwardly generalize for complex systems with nonparallel vortices . recall that penetrating flux profiles in the slab geometry may be obtained by solving the equation @xmath31 where the sign selection is made according to the rule : _ any electromotive force due to external field variations induces the maximum current density flow_.    in simple terms",
    ", one is just using lenz s law .",
    "thus , the macroscopic electrodynamics of a hard type - ii superconductor may be viewed as follows .",
    "owing to physical limitations imposed by the material properties , the current density could take any value within the interval @xmath32 $ ] , but as electromagnetic induction operates all along the process , one gets @xmath33 , according to the most effective way of shielding field variations . from our point of view , the physical limitations within the superconductor define a region in @xmath34-space where the current density could settle ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "lenz s law establishes that only the boundaries will be occupied ( or the point @xmath36 for regions where electric fields have not reached ) .    for higher dimensional systems ,",
    "i.e. : vortices are no longer straight parallel lines or @xmath37 is truly a vector [ see eq.([eq : ampere ] ) ] , the allowed region for the current density will be a subset of @xmath37-space . in this case , lenz s law is insufficient for determining the points where the current density lies along the magnetization process .",
    "faraday s law in full form must be appealed . in brief , our critical state theory includes ( i ) a material law of the kind @xmath0 and ( ii ) a variational statement of faraday s law .",
    "below , it will be shown that calling on ( ii ) , the solution of the problem @xmath38 only takes values on the boundary of @xmath1 ( or 0 ) .",
    "this has been sketched in fig.[fig : delta ] .",
    "thus , the _ essence of the critical state _ in superconductors , is defined by the condition @xmath39 the determination of the specific values @xmath40 for any process is described in the following subsection . a brief discussion on the physical basis of the mathematical statement is also given .",
    "as it was shown in previous work@xcite , the evolutionary magnetic processes in hard type - ii superconductors may be described by quite general principles of linear irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "let us consider a superconductor in some equilibrium state within the experimental range of interest .",
    "this means that the system of vortices is at rest by compensation of mutual interactions , pinning forces and the external field pressure . from the macroscopic point of view",
    ", the equilibrium states will be characterized by a magnetic field or current density pattern within the sample .",
    "for instance , one can define it by a vector function @xmath41 .",
    "consider a small perturbation that drives the system out of equilibrium .",
    "then , a non - equilibrium flow and linearly related internal forces will arise .",
    "specifically , the critical current density has been exceeded by some amount @xmath42 , linearly related to associated electric field components @xmath43 .",
    "stationary states in which the external drive keeps time independent values of @xmath44 can be straightforwardly solved by the principle of minimum global entropy production , introduced by prigogine in the context of linear irreversible thermodynamics@xcite . in this case , one can write it as @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the volume of the sample . the reader can check that in the particular case @xmath47 , this principle leads to the well known current distribution for the stationary regime in normal metals.@xcite    however , we are interested in the time evolution between equilibrium states induced by successive magnetic field changes",
    ". one can achieve an appropriate description just by adding up a term to eq.([eq : prigo ] ) which accounts for the magnetic field inertia , in the so - called _ quasistationary _ approximation .",
    "the physical idea is schematically shown in fig.[fig : quasista ] .",
    "we assume a time - discretized picture in which @xmath48 denotes the @xmath49-th time layer after @xmath49 equal time steps with increment @xmath50 .",
    "then , for small enough values of @xmath50 , one can also suppose that changes in the magnetic field configuration @xmath51 are small and substitute the continuum trajectory of the system by a polygonal approximation in which ( i ) @xmath51 changes at fixed time to @xmath52 ( _ inertia _ term ) and ( ii ) time is incremented for @xmath53 $ ] ( _ stationary _ entropy production term ) .",
    "then , the configuration @xmath52 may be obtained from the previous one by the minimization rule @xmath54 the rigorous proof that the previous principle is equivalent to faraday s law in discretized form plus a constitutive relation of the kind @xmath55 is straightforward by following the calculations in ref ..    the final form of our principle , which connects to the geometrical interpretation described in the previous paragraph is attained by considering vertical @xmath13 laws , i.e. : infinite flux flow resistivity .",
    "then , in order to avoid adding a divergent positive quantity , the entropy production term is replaced by the constraint @xmath0 .",
    "we end up with the principle    1.ex    in general , @xmath1 is a bounded region where the _ dc _ current density vector should remain .",
    "as it will be shown in the next subsection , the selection of this region corresponds to using a given critical state model .",
    "the kind of mathematical statement posed in eq.([eq : varpri ] ) may be solved by several methods .",
    "the authors@xcite have preferred to use the so - called _ optimal control _",
    "( oc ) theory,@xcite a powerful generalization of variational calculus , which allows to deal with a wide class of constrained problems . for the readers benefit we have included a brief survey of this mathematical tool as an appendix of this article",
    ". a reminder of the application to the critical state problem is given below .",
    "for the slab geometry , with applied magnetic field parallel to the faces , the current density restriction may be written @xmath56 this is called control system .",
    "hereafter , we take the x axis perpendicular to the slab faces and the origin of coordinates at the midplane . by construction ,",
    "the vector @xmath57 is orthogonal to the physical variable @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "notice that , owing to the applied rotation , we use the notation @xmath61 for the allowed control set .",

    "the modified penetrating profile @xmath66 equals the former profile @xmath78 before reaching the centre of the slab .",

    "we showed that the behavior described above may also be obtained in the framework of our theory for the isotropic model.@xcite it was remarked that the decoupling point @xmath158 is sharply defined by the process itself , and that further rotation leaves the field modulus unchanged .",
    "this behavior has been emphasized here ( see fig.[fig : rotiso ] ) .",
    "we have plotted a number of profiles subsequent to the issue of @xmath158 .",
    "notice that @xmath160 and @xmath161 are frozen for @xmath162 .",
    "notice also that , though these components evolve for @xmath163 , one gets a frozen modulus profile and nearly linear penetration of the rotation angle @xmath164 .",
    "physically , the process may be described as the separation of vortices in two groups , one which rigidly pins to the sample ( inner vortices ) , and another one which frictionally rotates relative to the sample while keeping a constant density profile ( outer vortices ) .",
    "finally , we will show that , as it was already guessed in ref .",
    ", the appearance of higher frequency oscillations ( @xmath165 ) in the magnetic moment components can be ascribed to anisotropy in the current flow .",
    "fig.[fig : rotaniso ] depicts our simulations for the field penetration profiles in a rotation experiment as calculated by the pseudo - isotropic model defined in the previous section .",
    "we want to notice the appearance of a v - shape modulus profile .",
    "however , by contrast to the isotropic case , this structure keeps no longer stationary .",
    "further rotation produces a complex two minima structure . a second turnabout ( @xmath166 )",
    "defines a new v structure and the process goes on in a periodic fashion . as regards the angle penetration profile @xmath164 , a multiple step structure is observed .",
    "the definition of decoupling points is accompanied by jumps in the rotation angle .",
    "subsequent steps produce a negative angle for inner points , which is interpreted as a counter rotation of flux lines .",
    "the double frequency signal , which was reported in the early 80 s by boyer and co - workers is straightforwardly related to the physical mechanisms described above . in fig.[fig : rotaclem ] we have plotted the averaged magnetization components both longitudinal ( @xmath167 ) and transverse ( @xmath168 ) to the applied field @xmath169 .",
    "the plot collects the evolution @xmath170 with respect to the applied rotation angle for three different values of the field modulus ( @xmath171 in our dimensionless units ) .",
    "note that , for the lowest field value , @xmath172 basically display a stationary harmonic behavior at the sample s rotation frequency @xmath173 .",
    "as @xmath157 increases , one can readily observe a frequency mixing phenomenon .",
    "eventually , for high enough fields , @xmath174 becomes a rotating vector at frequency @xmath165 .",
    "the rotational scenario of field cooled anisotropic samples with nonmagnetic initial state is established as follows .",
    "two groups of vortices exist : a rigid core well within the sample and a region of flux tubes below the surface , which undergo complex transport and cutting phenomena as rotation proceeds .",
    "the rigid core contributes as a harmonically oscillating magnetic moment when analyzed in a reference frame at rest with respect to the applied field . on the other hand",
    ", the _ active region _ of vortices close to the surface contributes with an essentially double frequency signal . for low enough fields ( @xmath175 ) the rigid core nearly spans over the whole sample and",
    "the response is linear . for high enough fields ( @xmath176 )",
    "the rigid core has disappeared and the response is at @xmath165 .",
    "intermediate values hold a frequency mixing , corresponding to the superposition of both effects .      for illustration of the characteristic phenomena in the crossed field configuration",
    ", we will discuss the results within refs .. hereafter , they will be named _",
    "park s _ and _ fisher s _ experiment respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the superconductor is firstly subjected to a magnetic field along a given direction ( f.i .",
    ": @xmath177 ) . subsequently , this component is fixed and the orthogonal one ( @xmath178 ) is cycled while recording the magnetic moment .    park and co - workers measured @xmath179 and @xmath180 for high - t@xmath181 crystals .",
    "their results show that @xmath180 vanishes as @xmath178 is cycled . additionally , a more or less conventional loop @xmath182 is observed .",
    "however , the loop fails to close after a field cycle has been completed .",
    "both features are reproduced by the application of our theory within the isotropic model ( see fig.[fig : crossed ] ) .",
    "finally , the _ symmetric supression _ of the magnetic moment @xmath180 by cycling @xmath178 reported by fisher may also be explained within the isotropic hypothesis . in fig.[fig : crossed ] we display our simulations of the diminishing behavior of @xmath180 , both for the para- and diamagnetic states . in the first case ,",
    "@xmath177 was cycled up to a positive magnetic moment state , and then fixed .",
    "in the second case , @xmath177 was raised up to a definite negative magnetic moment state .",
    "the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the described behavior have been extensively discussed in ref .. basically , owing to the rectriction @xmath183 , the shielding capability related to @xmath102 is decreased when a considerable amount of current is required for minimizing @xmath184 , which is the dominant process in the configurations discussed .",
    "the fundamental subject of our work is that a number of observables related to experiments with crossing vortices in hard superconductors may be well described in terms of critical state principles . in particular",
    ", we have shown that simulated rotation and crossed field experiments both for isotropic and anisotropic systems nicely reproduce the actual measurements .",
    "it is shown that bean s model for parallel vortices can be thought as a particular case of a general critical state theory .",
    "the main ingredients of the theory , which is given in the form of a variational principle , are the magnetic field inertia ( faraday s law ) and a very high level of entropy production for moving vortices when the threshold for static configurations is exceeded .",
    "the arising constrained minimization problem has been solved by optimal control@xcite techniques , which nicely fit the physical statement .",
    "however , we want to notice that other methods can be applied to solve the problem posed in eq.([eq : varpri ] ) . in particular , we suggets the use of the so - called",
    "_ direct methods_@xcite in which a family of appropriate base functions for the solution generates a problem in matrix form as in standard finite - element theories .",
    "although many relevant experimental facts can be explained within our theory , several approximations have been used in order to keep the mathematical intricacy to the lowest degree .",
    "an improved quantitative description would require the consideration of finite size effects , the influence of equilibrium magnetization , and the finite value of the flux - flow resistivity .",
    "these are merely technical aspects which can be incorporated by using oc for partial differential equations , a definite @xmath185 relation and a dissipation term in the variational quantity .",
    "financial support from spanish cicyt ( projects mat99 - 1028 and bfm-2000 - 1066/c0301 ) is acknowledged .",
    "control theory is a branch of dynamical systems theory in which the usual ingredients are a family of evolution differential equations of the system containing the time , some phase space coordinates representing the states of the system , and extra control variables modelling some external action applied over it .",
    "the applications of the theory have been mainly developed in the field of engineering . within this realm , the controls are the representation of some manual or automatized action and , thus , affected by limitations . in mathematical terms , the controls belong to a bounded set .",
    "self - organized critical systems , which are a flourishing research area in physics , seem to be a natural candidate for the application of this mathematical tool . in this case",
    ", the control variables and limitations are related to physical interactions .",
    "in particular , the magnetic properties of hard type - ii superconductors rely on the interaction between flux tubes and a maximum force from the underlying pinning structure .    in order to develop the optimal control theory in a brief but self - contained presentation",
    ", one should begin by recalling some concepts on the classical variational calculus ( see ref . for a comprehensive and detailed exposition of the topic ) .",
    "given a lagrangian function of position and velocity @xmath186 , the problem of minimizing the action integral @xmath187 for a curve @xmath188 with fixed endpoints @xmath189 , @xmath190 generates , by applying a first order variation @xmath191 of the curve and after integration by parts , the well - known euler - lagrange equations @xmath192 above , the boundary conditions which imply the conditions @xmath193 have been invoked in the integration by parts . for other boundary conditions",
    ", these terms do not vanish authomatically , and some extra _ transversality _ conditions appear .",
    "for example , if the final point is not fixed but belongs to some hypersurface @xmath194 , then its first order variation @xmath195 is tangent to the hypersurface , and therefore the extra condition is @xmath196 the hamiltonian version of the classical variational calculus , so important in the process of quantization of the fundamental physical theories , and also in the study of many dynamical systems , will be obtained below using a kind of trick that will be useful later on .",
    "let us consider that coordinates @xmath197 are independent of coordinates @xmath198 , and afterwards let us impose the constraint @xmath199 . in this case , on using the method of lagrange multipliers for constrained minimization problems , we must use the action integral @xmath200 , where @xmath74 are the lagrange multiplier variables , and @xmath201 is a positive constant for minimizing problems .",
    "the euler - lagrange system for this extended lagrangian comprises three families of equations , one for each base variable @xmath202 .",
    "we get @xmath203 for first order variations in @xmath198 , @xmath204 for first order variations in @xmath74 , and @xmath205 for first order variation in @xmath197 .",
    "the last equations define the legendre transformation between velocity @xmath206 and phase @xmath207 spaces . for most cases in the context of classical mechanics ,",
    "this map is an isomorphism and can be inverted to solve for @xmath208 as a function of @xmath209 and @xmath113 .",
    "this relates straightforwardly to the condition @xmath210 .",
    "then , it is a simple exercise to check that the other two families of equations can be written in the form @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the usual hamiltonian .    for some _ pathological _ cases ,",
    "the lagrangian function is not regular and the legendre map is not invertible .",
    "however , a hamiltonian theory can still be constructed , but the true hamiltonian equations live in a mixed velocity - phase space , with independent @xmath202 coordinates . in such problems ,",
    "one of the families of equations ( those determining @xmath213 ) is not differential but algebraic .",
    "one has a so - called dae system ( differential algebraic equations ) @xmath214 with @xmath215 .",
    "let us now introduce a _ control system _ for the velocities @xmath216 here , the coordinates @xmath134 are the so - called controls , in general , taking values within some subset @xmath217 .",
    "these extra coordinates may be modelling some external action on the system or also some intrinsic limitation as it is the case of the critical current density in superconductors .",
    "let us also assume that we want to minimize a functional @xmath218 .",
    "we notice that the control system may be thought as a parametric description of some subset of the velocity space , and therefore as a constraint for the minimization problem .",
    "this constraint directly relates to the singular behavior of the matrix @xmath219 and the method for pathological systems must be applied .",
    "one must consider the hamiltonian equations for @xmath220 , i.e. @xmath221 note that the last equation is a first order necessary condition of minimality relating only to stationary internal points of the region @xmath1 .",
    "for general problems with bounded control spaces , a stronger condition for determining the solution @xmath222 is required .",
    "this is given by the so - called _ maximum principle of pontryagin_@xcite , which we state without proof here @xmath223 as far as this condition can be explicitly solved , we get @xmath224 , and after back substitution into the other equations we get a system of first order ordinary differential equations . as regards the boundary conditions , they can be simple as in the case of fixed endpoints for @xmath198 , or they can include transversality conditions , as pointed before .",
    "for example , when the final set for @xmath225 is an hypersurface of @xmath226 , the transversality condition means that @xmath74 is perpendicular to the hypersurface ( in particular , free final point @xmath225 means that the hypersurface is @xmath226 itself and implies a vanishing final momentum ) .",
    "sometimes the problem does not have a defined final point @xmath227 ; then , the associated transversality condition is the vanishing of the hamiltonian at this unknown point.@xcite    just for simplicity , the previous exposition has been done within the scenario of particle dynamics .",
    "of course , it can be extended to continuous systems by using the fields as dynamical variables and defining the corresponding lagrangian and hamiltonian densities .",
