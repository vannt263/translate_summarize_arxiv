    "among the variety of promising technologies to carry out quantum information processing , spin - based solid - state qubit technologies have great appeal through the potential use of large - scale fabrication techniques to scale up a quantum computer design @xcite .",
    "although there have been a number of proposals for carrying out universal quantum gates in this respect , the read out of the information from individual spin - based qubits - the very last and necessary step in any quantum processor routine - is still a major difficulty .",
    "the main idea of current theoretical proposals for single spin detection is to convert spin - state encoded quantum information into charge state encodings .",
    "since the energy of a multi - electron system is spin - dependent , due to the pauli exclusion principle , one can engineer a current whose spin polarization depends on spin - qubit state and thus provides a measurement of the electronic spin state @xcite .",
    "experimentally , scanning- tunneling- microscope electron spin resonance ( esr ) has reached the single spin level in the case of iron impurities in silicon @xcite .",
    "however the precise mechanism responsible for this effect is not yet well understood .",
    "magnetic resonance force microscopy may also become a useful technique for single electron spin detection where the cantilever oscillation is resonantly driven by a single spin @xcite .",
    "however this technique will require further development before this technique reaches single spin sensitivity although significant advances have been recently demonstrated @xcite .",
    "recently , the movement of individual electrons has been evidenced by a @xmath1-based single electron transistor through electro - mechanical coupling @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that this arrangement can be used as a single spin detector in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "although our focus here is to use a micro - squid ( superconducting quantum interference device - a device capable of distinguishing large spin difference ( @xmath2 ) @xcite ) , we argue that to obtain sufficient sensitivity it will be useful to combine this device with methods which could convert the small spin-1/2 qubit signal into a system with a much larger spin .",
    "what we want to detect is the @xmath3 component of the electronic spin state of the dopant atom inside a fullerene @xmath1 .",
    "this doped fullerene or endohedral fullerene is the primary host for quantum information in a number of fullerene based quantum computer designs which include the endohedral molecules @xmath4 or @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "in these types of designs , the quantum information is encoded in the nuclear spin of the endohedral atom .",
    "the execution of quantum gates utilises the hyperfine interaction and magnetic dipolar coupling via the application of standard nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and esr pulse sequences .",
    "it has been clearly demonstrated in @xcite that fullerene - based quantum computing meets the requirement for a quantum computer , except for the lack of an effective readout technique .",
    "since the nuclear spin is less sensitive to the external environment , our detection of a single spin state would be carried out on the electronic spin state after the nuclear spin states have been swapped to the electronic spin states .",
    "since the problem we consider is only related to the readout of quantum information from a single electron spin state , we will neglect nuclear spins in this paper .",
    "there are three valence electrons in the dopant atom @xmath6 or @xmath7 , whose ground state in the presence of magnetic field is @xmath8 . because other excited states are of much higher energy , the only spin state suitable for encoding qubits is @xmath8 , which can be considered as a single spin-3/2 state with quartet components @xmath9 and @xmath10 in a magnetic field .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that universal quantum information processing can be carried out independently with inner qubits @xmath11 or outer qubits @xmath12 .",
    "therefore what we want to detect is whether the inner qubit is in @xmath13 or @xmath14 or whether the outer qubit is in @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "since the electrons of the dopant atoms of @xmath1 are always trapped in the cage made of 60 carbon atoms , the qubit detection mechanisms suggested in @xcite , can not be applied here as these endohedral electrons can not be liberated from the cage without destroying the delicate qubit information encoded in their @xmath3 spin states .",
    "so the key step of our scheme is to swap the encapsulated spin state to an outside auxiliary spin state which is easily detectable .",
    "we consider the following hamiltonian describes the endohedral electronic system coupled to a nearby auxiliary large - spin system , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the spin ( to be detected ) , inside the fullerene with @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the bohr magneton , b@xmath22 being the magnetic field strength along z - axis , and @xmath23 the pauli matrix for @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is related to the auxiliary system with large spin and @xmath26 is the coupling between the two systems in a magnetic field .",
    "we employ a molecular nanomagnet made of fe@xmath0 @xcite , which is small but has a relatively high magnetic moment , as the auxiliary system .",
    "it has already been shown that one can experimentally prepare a single fe@xmath0 crystal in the ground states @xmath27 at very low temperatures ( @xmath28 mk ) @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that one can observe the quantum tunneling of magnetization in a single fe@xmath0 crystal , which will prove useful for our swap operation .",
    "the lowest energy levels of fe@xmath0 can be described as a spin-10 hamiltonian @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 k is the axial anisotropy constant and @xmath31 . in what follows",
    ", we define @xmath32 in units of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is the pauli matrix for @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is the transverse anisotropy due to the applied magnetic field in x - y plane , which yields the tunnel splitting @xcite .",
    "the exact form of @xmath37 is not important in our discussion .",
    "moreover , the term concerning @xmath38 whose coefficient is much smaller than d is omitted in eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) .",
    "we suppose that the detected endohedral spin is coupled to the auxiliary spin of the molecular magnet by magnetic dipolar interaction , which is generally described as @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 the usual polar and azimuth angles , respectively .",
    "( [ one ] ) can be exactly solved by numerical computation . for simplicity",
    ", however , we will investigate the system under consideration following the assumptions below : ( i ) the transverse anisotropy terms will be neglected in the following deduction as done in @xcite , because it is not essential to our conclusion .",
    "( we will go beyond this assumption when discussing the quantum tunneling of magnetization . ) ( ii ) only the ising - type term @xmath48 , related to @xmath49 , will be retained in h@xmath50 , which is valid in the weak coupling limit @xcite . as we will show below , in our implementation , the detuning is much larger than j@xmath51 , so we can safely omit the terms in h@xmath50 other than @xmath48 . as a result , the hamiltonian under consideration can be simply rewritten as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and we assume @xmath54 k @xcite .",
    "since all the terms in eq .",
    "( [ three ] ) are diagonal , it is easy to obtain the eigenstates as well as the corresponding eigenenergies , as shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "our scheme consists of two essential steps : the first step is to swap the detected endohedral electronic spin states inside the fullerene to the ground states @xmath27 of fe@xmath0 .",
    "then as the second step , we measure the states @xmath27 from fe@xmath0 . since a swap consists of three controlled - not ( cnot ) operations , we will investigate in this section how to carry out cnot within our model .",
    "to this end , we will make use of the quantum tunneling of magnetization in a single fe@xmath0 molecule .",
    "_ 1 . implementation of cnot@xmath55_. table [ tab1 ] shows the existence of degenerate transitions in the subspace regarding @xmath56 .",
    "these transitions are heavily dependent on the coupling ( or neighboring ) spin states in @xmath25 . based on this characteristic ,",
    "the irradiation of a esr pulse with a resonant frequency on the first spin yields , in the interaction representation , an effective hamiltonian ( @xmath33 ) for the subsystem of @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the rabi frequency , @xmath59 and the resonant frequency is one of the degenerate transition frequencies labeled in table [ tab1 ] . for a @xmath60 pulse irradiation of esr ,",
    "i.e. @xmath61 , @xmath26 yields the operator @xmath62 which works independently in the subspace spanned by @xmath12 or the one spanned by @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , with the operator @xmath63 , we can flip states @xmath12 or @xmath11 of a single qubit with an esr pulse whose frequency is determined by the neighboring spin state in @xmath25 .",
    "that is actually a cnot@xmath55 operation .",
    "theoretically , the fidelity of this selective pulse method depends on more detailed characteristics of the physically coupled systems . the implementation time is determined by the rabi frequency @xmath58 .",
    "implementation of cnot@xmath64_. due to the term @xmath65 , the levels in fe@xmath0 are not equidistant and so cnot@xmath64 can not be carried out by the above method with selective esr pulses .",
    "let us simply consider the case of very low temperature , in which only the ground states @xmath27 of @xmath25 are populated .",
    "by considering @xmath27 coupled with the possible qubit states of h@xmath66 , we show the magnetic field dependence of the energy in fig .",
    "1 , where the displayed crossing points correspond to the doublet degenerate cases . however , if we include the neglected term @xmath37 in our calculation , all of these crossing points would turn into avoided crossings due to the tunneling splitting . so by sweeping the magnetic field b@xmath22 through these ( avoided ) crossing points , we should have tunneling between different magnetization states .",
    "for example , with the magnetic field b@xmath22 swept through 0.019 t ( from 0.019@xmath67 t to 0.019@xmath68 t ) , we have the magnetization tunneling from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "1 the ( avoided ) crossing points of different kinds of lines mean the places where the magnetization tunneling occurs with very small probability due to the second or higher - order process , e.g. @xmath71 . moreover , since the eigenenergies associated with @xmath72 and @xmath73 are much higher , and thus are physically hard to reach in the low temperature case , we omit them in fig . 1 .",
    "the fidelity of our scheme is affected by the following : ( 1 ) we must have precise knowledge of the dipolar coupling strength @xmath74 , as this determines the quality of the cnot gates we perform .",
    "the @xmath75value can be obtained experimentally by interrogative esr pulses .",
    "( 2 ) we must have very small linewidth selective esr pulses .",
    "since the wavelength of the esr pulse is much larger than the distance between fe@xmath0 and c60 , for avoiding exciting fe@xmath0 when we perform cnot@xmath55 , it is required that the linewidths of esr pulses be narrower than @xmath74 , the minimal difference between degenerate transition frequencies .",
    "( 3 ) we must accurately control the tunneling time in the performance of cnot@xmath64 .",
    "this time depends on the sweep rate of the magnetic field and the tunnel splitting .",
    "we prefer a fast tunneling to make the implementation time of swap shorter than the decoherence time . in this case , we need a large tunnel splitting at the avoided crossing points .",
    "due to the very high sensitivity ( which reaches @xmath76 electromagnetic units @xcite ) , and from the full spectrum analysis we have done for nanomagnets @xcite , the micro - squid can hopefully be used to measure the spin states of single fe@xmath0 crystals directly by standard spectroscopy with pulsed esr @xcite .",
    "although the experimental value of the coupling @xmath74 is not yet known , we expect @xmath74 to be suitably large for our purpose in implementing the cnot gates .",
    "first , as mentioned above , the prerequisite of a perfect cnot@xmath55 implementation is that the linewidth of the esr pulse is smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "so the larger the coupling @xmath74 , the less strict the requirement for the linewidth of the esr pulse .",
    "secondly , a larger coupling @xmath74 is advantageous to achieve more accurate implementations of the magnetization tunneling . in terms of our numerical calculation , if @xmath74 is very close to zero , all the ( avoided ) crossing points",
    "would be nearly overlapping .",
    "it implies that our scheme would not work because we could not distinguish different qubit spin states from the tunneling signal .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath74 can not be too large . to keep the weak coupling limit in eq .",
    "( [ three ] ) valid , @xmath77 should be much smaller than min \\{@xmath78 , d}. in our case with @xmath54 k corresponding to 350 mhz , esr pulses with much narrower linewidths have already been achieved experimentally @xcite.for the magnetization tunneling @xmath79 occurring at @xmath80 t , @xmath81 .",
    "nevertheless , as long as the dipolar angle @xmath46 in @xmath26 is close to @xmath82 , terms @xmath83 and @xmath84 in h@xmath50 would be nearly zero , and other terms ( except @xmath48 ) could be neglected in the weak limit and so eq . (",
    "[ three ] ) still holds .    an essential point for implementing our scheme",
    "is that the swap time should be shorter than the decoherence time of the system . for fe@xmath0 ,",
    "the t@xmath66 times for the @xmath27 ground states are very long , while the encapsulated spin states in the fullerene also posses long t@xmath66 times ,  1 sec at 7 k @xcite , and probably several seconds for lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "thus the dominant source of decoherence in our model would be due to the hyperfine level broadening produced by the nuclei @xcite .",
    "this causes undesired dephasing in our scheme during the quantum tunneling of magnetization .",
    "we consider the swap time to be @xmath85 t@xmath51 with t@xmath51 being the magnetization tunneling time . with current experimental techniques ,",
    "@xmath86 mhz is available @xcite , and t@xmath51 can be from nanosec to sec depending on the transverse magnetic field @xcite . in the experiment of @xcite ,",
    "it is shown that , in temperatures below 350 mk , and in the presence of b@xmath87 mt and a transverse b - field  200 mt , the line broadening is about 0.8 mt , corresponding to 22.4 mhz in units of frequency .",
    "so if we assume @xmath88 mhz , to carry out our scheme , we require that t@xmath51 be shorter than 71 nanosec .",
    "another point we should mention is the initial state preparation of fe@xmath0 .",
    "since the detected spin inside the fullerene in the readout stage should be well polarized , we can simply convert the spin information from @xmath56 to @xmath25 by performing cnot@xmath64 , instead of swap .",
    "this would simplify the readout scheme we mentioned above . to this end , however , we need to precisely prepare the initial states of fe@xmath0 to be @xmath89 or @xmath90 .",
    "this too can be done by the quantum tunneling of magnetization .",
    "when we sweep the b@xmath22 field quickly , we can have an oscillation between @xmath89 and @xmath91 , whose frequency is heavily related to the tunnel splitting . by stopping the sweep field at an exactly chosen time , we can have a perfect initial state @xmath89 or @xmath91 of fe@xmath0 .    in summary , we have proposed a potential method to efficiently detect the single spin state inside the fullerene by means of an auxiliary large spin nanomagnet .",
    "since the spin states of the large - spin nanomagnet are measurable with current experimental techniques ( e.g. micro - squid ) , we can reliably detect the qubit - encoded spin states inside the fullerene by swapping the detected state into the ground states of a nanomagnet .",
