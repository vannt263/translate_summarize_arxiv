    "the carriers are strongly ferromagnetically coupled , due to hund s rule coupling , to the mn core which also results in the hopping of electrons between the mn ions .",
    "however , it was pointed out that the coupling of carriers to local jahn - teller(jt ) distortions and to the mn spins must also be considered@xcite .",
    "further , several recent experiments seem to support the phase separation model@xcite .",
    "thermal transport measurements provide additional crucial information on the various scattering mechanisms of thermal carriers such as electrons and phonons and are expected to improve the understanding of some of the phenomena encountered in the manganites .",
    "there have been relatively few reports @xcite on thermal transport in cubic manganites .",
    "the thermal conductivity of cubic manganites has been discussed on the basis of static and dynamic lattice distortions by several authors .",
    "it should be noted that the ln@xmath8d@xmath9 mno@xmath10 cubic perovskite compounds belong to the ruddlesden - popper series generally described as ( ln , d)@xmath11mn @xmath12o@xmath13 with @xmath14 . for @xmath15 ,",

    ", the value of @xmath47 reaches 4.07   at 300k . in our estimation ,",
    "the value of @xmath48 is taken as a constant since the relative variation of the longitudinal velocity is very small from ultrasonic measurements on the bilayer manganites .",

    "the value of @xmath21 of the @xmath22 sample remained almost a constant down to @xmath19 200k , then showed a slight increase upon crossing @xmath49 160 k and finally dropped rapidly with decreasing temperature .",

    "figures [ lt ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the anisotropic lattice striction and volume striction for the z=0 , 0.2 and 0.4 samples , respectively .",
    "the anomaly in anisotropic lattice striction reverses sign near z=0.2 but the volume of all samples rapidly shrinks upon crossing @xmath39 .",
    "these findings have been discussed in ref.21 on the basis of different relaxation models of local lattice distortions in metal and insulating states proposed by maderda et al.@xcite .",
    "the authors tried to explain the different behaviors of average and local lattice distortions observed in neutron powder diffraction experiments on la@xmath54sr@xmath55mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( 0.32@xmath56x@xmath560.4 ) .",
    "based on their explanation , the observed volume shrinkage near @xmath39 seems to arise from a strong suppression in the local lattice disorder manifested by mn@xmath57-o@xmath58 and mn@xmath59-o@xmath58 octahedra with the jt distorted and undistorted sites when the system is going towards the metallic state from the insulating state . the mno bond - length distribution becomes narrower below @xmath39 because of a screening effect due to itinerant carriers .",
    "accordingly , the phonon conduction is limited by the local lattice disorder accompanying a polaron hopping in the insulating state . however , in the metallic region , it is expected that the homogenous structure of the local lattice associated with carrier delocalization , causes an upturn in the @xmath25-plane thermal conductivity , below @xmath39 .",
    "it should be noted that this conclusion is reached from the lattice striction and thermal data of the same samples , combined with the preceding model .",
    "furthermore , in comparison with the anisotropic debye - waller ( d - w ) factor of sr@xmath10mn@xmath4o@xmath5 , the anisotropic d - w data of la@xmath54sr@xmath55mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( 0.32@xmath56x@xmath560.4 ) show that , even in the metallic state of the latter , the inhomogeneities in the local lattice structure still remain .",
    "this finding is probably related , not only with a small upturn in @xmath21 , but also to the low values of @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "the out - of - plane phonon conduction across the mno double - layers is strongly disturbed from stacking fault - like scattering , of the layered structures .",
    "phonon scattering due to stacking faults dominates thermal conduction along the @xmath16-axis , masks some contribution of the local lattice distortion associated with the insulator to metal transition and results in to the anisotropy of the thermal conductivity .",

    "the field was in the ab - plane and parallel to the direction of the heat current .",
    "our data reveal several interesting features .",
    "first , a giant magnetothermal conductivity was observed in association with the occurrence of the cmr effect and the nmtc reached about 30% , up to 8 t , for all samples in spite of a lower @xmath39 .",
    "here , it should be noted that @xmath60/ @xmath61 is almost negligible in contrast with a rapid enhancement of @xmath40 ( h)/@xmath40 ( 0 ) , which is consistent with the absence of anomalies observed in @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "second , accompanying the field - induced first - order pi to fm transition of the insulating sample , z=0.6 , a clear hysteresis in the magnetothermal conductivity was observed .",
    "the remnant nmtc at 4.2k reached nearly the same value of @xmath1910% , both in first and second scans , where , after the first scan , the sample was warmed up to high temperatures in order to demagnetize it .",
    "the value of nmtc of the @xmath36 sample exhibited a step - like behavior at 4.2 k , while it showed a smooth rise with increasing temperature .",
    "as previously pointed out , electronic contribution from the w - f law estimation using the cmr data reproduces neither an upturn in @xmath40 nor a giant thermal effect .",
    "magnetostriction data around @xmath39 showed a volume shrinkage upon application of a magnetic field , up to 8 t , as well as spontaneous striction ( @xmath190.1% ) upon crossing @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the negative magnetovolume effect indicates a suppression in local lattice disorder;the reduction in phonon scattering due to structural disorder leads to a giant magnetothermal effect in the same way as the upturn in @xmath21 below @xmath39 .",
    "normalized magnetothermal resistivity [ @xmath63@xmath64/@xmath21@xmath65@xmath66 of ( la@xmath0pr@xmath1 ) @xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath34 , 0.2 , 0.4 and 0.6 ) single crystals as a function of magnetization , at selected temperature.(a)@xmath6=0;(b ) @xmath6=0.2 and ( c ) @xmath6=0.4 and 0.6 . the insets in figs.5(a , b , c)represent @xmath33-@xmath67 curves at the corresponding temperatures for the samples with @xmath6=0 , 0.2 and 0.6 respectively.(d)@xmath6 dependence of coefficient @xmath68 and lattice parameter @xmath69,width=377 ]      the normalized magnetothermal resistivity [ @xmath63@xmath64/@xmath21@xmath65@xmath66 of our samples is plotted as a function of magnetization at selected temperatures in fig.5 ( a , b , c ) , where the insets in figs.5 ( a ) , 5 ( b ) and 5 ( c)represent @xmath33-@xmath67 curves at the corresponding temperatures for the samples with @xmath6=0 , 0.2 and 0.6 respectively .",
    "it is easily found that the value of the magnetothermal resistivity is scaled with a parabolic function of @xmath70@xmath71)@xmath72 , as pointed out for cubic manganites , by cohn et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath73 is taken as the value of 3.6@xmath74@xmath75 per mn - sites .",
    "the coefficient @xmath68 depends on the value of @xmath6 and shows a monotonical decrease from 0.4 for @xmath6=0 down to 0.28 for @xmath6=0.6 , as shown in fig5.(d ) .",
    "this finding suggests a suppression of the lattice - spin coupling in thermal cmr due to pr - substitution and can be explained as follows .",
    "the pr - substitution had a strong effect on the magnetic anisotropies .",
    "the low - temperature magnetic anisotropy @xmath33/@xmath76 in a field of 100mt reduced from @xmath1910 at @xmath6=0 to nearly 1 at @xmath6=0.2 and 0.4 . for @xmath6=0.6 , the easy axis of magnetization was along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "on the other hand , the lattice parameters vary with pr - substitution in such a manner that the @xmath16-axis expands but the @xmath77 axis shrinks ( see fig.5 ( d ) ) which results in a change of @xmath24-electron character from planar @xmath78 to linear @xmath79 .",
    "accordingly , such a variation of the @xmath24-electron character accompanies that of magnetic anisotropy , so that pr - substitution probably suppresses indirectly the lattice - spin coupling in thermal cmr through a variation of spin alignment , strongly coupled with orbital states . in other words ,",
    "a higher magnetothermal conduction favors the occurrence of the easy axis of magnetization lying in the @xmath25-plane .",
    "it is an interesting feature that a change of @xmath24-electron character , due to pr - substitution , appears in giant magnetothermal effect involving heat carrying phonons .",
    "finally , we shall stress that at lower temperatures , far from @xmath39 , a finite increase of @xmath40 ( @xmath1914% at 8 t ) for the @xmath6=0.2 crystal was observed .",
    "if we accept the above explanation , this finding indicates that phonon scattering due to local lattice disorder ( bond - length fluctuation ) remains , even in the metallic state , which is consistent with the anisotropic d - w data of la@xmath54sr@xmath55mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( 0.32@xmath56x@xmath560.4 ) in the metallic state .",
    "recently , maezono et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that in manganite systems , the dynamic jt effect is more enhanced in the metallic region than in the insulating region because of strong electron correlations .",
    "magnetothermal measurements , at low temperatures , probe the lattice disorder not only in the insulating region but also in the metallic region as the d - w factor does . furthermore , it is desirable to clarify the crucial role played by the dynamic local lattice distortion on phonon conduction , not only in the insulating phase , but also in the metallic phase through magnetothermal measurements on high quality single crystal of the extremely doped bilayer compounds .    in summary , a systematic study of thermal conductivity as a function of temperature and magnetic field of single crystals of the compound ( la@xmath0pr@xmath1)@xmath2sr@xmath3mn@xmath4o@xmath5 for @xmath6(pr ) = 0.2,0.4 . and",

    "the typical phonon behavior observed for the end member @xmath17=1 sample is probably attributed to a reduction of the inhomogeneities in the local lattice distortions strongly coupled with small polarons .",
