    "continuous variable ( cv ) quantum information processing @xcite    in the description of cv systems , an important role is played by probability quasidistributions , which represent each field mode by a real two - dimensional function @xcite .",
    "when this function is of gaussian shape , the corresponding state is referred to as _",
    "gaussian_. due to the ease of both experimental and theoretical treatment of such states , they are , together with gaussian operations preserving the gaussian nature of the quasidistributions , a significant part of cv quantum information . unfortunately , purification and distillation of entanglement are impossible to accomplish for gaussian states by using feasible gaussian operations alone @xcite . note , that a similar no - go theorem also holds for single mode squeezed states @xcite .",
    "namely , it is impossible to use passive gaussian operations , balanced homodyne detection and feedforward to transform an arbitrary number of gaussian states into a single state with squeezing better than the initial one , where the squeezing is characterized by the lowest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix . on the other hand , gaussian operations are sufficient to improve purity of a squeezed state if loss of squeezing is accepted @xcite .    to allow for increasing the entanglement of gaussian states by local means ,",
    "one has to at one point step out of the gaussian domain , as was in @xcite .",
    "the complete distillation protocol , proposed by @xcite , consists of two steps : de - gaussification by a single photon subtraction @xcite followed by gaussification by means of interference on beamsplitters , measurement and conditioning .",
    "however , if the initial states are already non - gaussian , for example due to the effect of non - gaussian noise , it is possible to distill and purify them by employing only linear optics , homodyne detection and post - selection @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite distillation of squeezing from states disturbed by phase diffusion noise .",
    "this noise , caused by random fluctuations of optical phase , commonly occurs in optical communication links .",
    "the distillation protocol is based on the interference of two copies of the state at a balanced beamsplitter , followed by homodyne detection of one mode triggering the acceptance or rejection of the other mode that contains the purified state @xcite .",
    "the procedure can be straightforwardly extended to accommodate two - mode squeezed states and can also serve as the gaussification part of the universal cv distillation protocol based on de - gaussification and subsequent gaussification .    in this paper",
    "we provide detailed theoretical numerical treatment of the distillation and purification of phase diffused single - mode squeezed states .",
    "we consider the standard iterative purification protocol @xcite as well as the simultaneous collective purification of an arbitrary number of copies of the decohered state .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of conditioning on the measurement of an arbitrary quadrature operator , up to abandoning the concept of definite quadrature completely and using phase - randomized homodyne detection .",
    "finally we derive a semi - analytical expression for the state obtained in the limit of infinite number of iterations of the distillation procedure and discuss its properties .",
