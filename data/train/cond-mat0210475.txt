    "section  [ analysis ] develops an analytic treatment of model , explaining some of the numerical findings of section  [ overview ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ summa ] with a discussion of how the model may be enhanced to bring it closer to real - life markets , and some comments comparing the approach taken here to standard models based on information arrival and valuation .      in this paper",
    "we analyze the continuous double auction trading mechanism under the assumption of random order flow , developing a model introduced in @xcite .",
    "this analysis produces quantitative predictions about the most basic properties of markets , such as volatility , depth of stored supply and demand , the bid - ask spread , the price impact , and probability and time to fill .",
    "these predictions are based on the rate at which orders flow into the market , and other parameters of the market , such as order size and tick size .",
    "the predictions are falsifiable with no free parameters .",
    "this extends the original random walk model of bachelier @xcite by providing a basis for the diffusion rate of prices .",
    "the model also provides a possible explanation for the highly concave nature of the price impact function .",
    "even though some of the assumptions of the model are too simple to be literally true , the model provides a foundation onto which more realistic assumptions may easily be added .",
    "the model demonstrates the importance of financial institutions in setting prices , and how solving a necessary economic function such as providing liquidity can have unanticipated side - effects . in a world of imperfect rationality and imperfect information , the task of demand storage necessarily causes persistence . under perfect rationality",
    "all traders would instantly update their orders with the arrival of each piece of new information , but this is clearly not true for real markets .",
    "the limit order book , which is the queue used for storing unexecuted orders , has long memory when there are persistent orders .",
    "it can be regarded as a device for storing supply and demand , somewhat like a capacitor is a device for storing charge .",
    "we show that even under completely random iid order flow , the price process displays anomalous diffusion and interesting temporal structure .",
    "the converse is also interesting : for prices to be effectively random , incoming order flow must be non - random , in just the right way to compensate for the persistence .",
    "( see the remarks in section  [ valuation ] . )",
    "this work is also of interest from a fundamental point of view because it suggests an alternative approach to doing economics .",
    "the assumption of perfect rationality has been popular in economics because it provides a parsimonious model that makes strong predictions . in the spirit of gode and sunder @xcite , we show that the opposite extreme of zero intelligence random behavior provides another reference model that also makes very strong predictions .",
    "like perfect rationality , zero intelligence is an extreme simplification that is obviously not literally true . but as we show here , it provides a useful tool for probing the behavior of financial institutions . the resulting model may easily be extended by introducing simple boundedly rational behaviors .",
    "we also differ from standard treatments in that we do not attempt to understand the properties of prices from fundamental assumptions about utility . rather , we split the problem in two .",
    "we attempt to understand how prices depend on order flow rates , leaving the problem of what determines these order flow rates for the future .",
    "one of our main results concerns the average price impact function .",
    "the liquidity for executing a market order can be characterized by a price impact function @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 is the shift in the logarithm of the price at time @xmath2 caused by a market order of size @xmath3 placed at time @xmath4 . understanding price impact is important for practical reasons such as minimizing transaction costs , and also because it is closely related to an excess demand function , providing a natural starting point for theories of statistical or dynamical properties of markets @xcite .",
    "a naive argument predicts that the price impact @xmath5 should increase at least linearly .",
    "this argument goes as follows : fractional price changes should not depend on the scale of price .",
    "suppose buying a single share raises the price by a factor @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath7 is constant , buying @xmath3 shares in succession should raise it by @xmath8 .",
    "thus , if buying @xmath3 shares all at once affects the price at least as much as buying them one at a time , the ratio of prices before and after impact should increase at least exponentially .",
    "taking logarithms implies that the price impact as we have defined it above should increase at least linearly .",
    "in contrast , from empirical studies @xmath9 for buy orders appears to be concave @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have shown for that for stocks in the nyse the concave behavior of the price impact is quite consistent across different stocks @xcite .",
    "our model produces concave price impact functions that are in qualitative agreement with these results .",
    "our work also demonstrates the value of physics techniques for economic problems .",
    "our analysis makes extensive use of dimensional analysis , the solution of a master equation through a generating functional , and a mean field approach that is commonly used to analyze non - equilibrium reaction - diffusion systems and evaporation - deposition problems .",
    "most modern financial markets operate continuously .",
    "the mismatch between buyers and sellers that typically exists at any given instant is solved via an order - based market with two basic kinds of orders .",
    "impatient traders submit _ market orders _",
    ", which are requests to buy or sell a given number of shares immediately at the best available price .",
    "more patient traders submit _ limit orders _ , or _ quotes _ which also state a limit price , corresponding to the worst allowable price for the transaction .",
    "( note that the word `` quote '' can be used either to refer to the limit price or to the limit order itself . )",
    "limit orders often fail to result in an immediate transaction , and are stored in a queue called the _ limit order book_. buy limit orders are called _ bids _ , and sell limit orders are called _ offers _ or _ asks_. we use the logarithmic price @xmath10 to denote the position of the best ( lowest ) offer and @xmath11 for the position the best ( highest ) bid .",
    "these are also called the _ inside quotes_.",
    "there is typically a non - zero price gap between them , called the _",
    "spread _ @xmath12 . prices are not continuous , but rather have discrete quanta called _",
    "ticks_. throughout this paper , all prices will be expressed as logarithms , and to avoid endless repetition , the word _ price",
    "_ will mean the logarithm of the price .",
    "the minimum interval that prices change on is the _ tick size _ @xmath13 ( also defined on a logarithmic scale ;",
    "note this is not true for real markets ) .",
    "note that @xmath13 is _ not _ necessarily infinitesimal .",
    "as market orders arrive they are matched against limit orders of the opposite sign in order of first price and then arrival time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bookschematic ] .     or @xmath11 move whenever an incoming market order has sufficient size to fully deplete the stored volume at @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "our model assumes that market order arrival , limit order arrival , and limit order cancellation follow a poisson process .",
    "new offers ( sell limit orders ) can be placed at any price greater than the best bid , and are shown here as `` raining down '' on the price axis .",
    "similarly , new bids ( buy limit orders ) can be placed at any price less than the best offer .",
    "bids and offers that fall inside the spread become the new best bids and offers . all prices in this model are logarithmic . ]    because orders are placed for varying numbers of shares , matching is not necessarily one - to - one .",
    "for example , suppose the best offer is for 200 shares at $ 60 and the the next best is for 300 shares at $ 60.25 ; a buy market order for 250 shares buys 200 shares at $ 60 and 50 shares at $ 60.25 , moving the best offer @xmath10 from $ 60 to $ 60.25 . a high density of limit orders per price results in high _ liquidity _ for market orders , i.e. , it decreases the price movement when a market order is placed .",
    "let @xmath14 be the stored density of limit order volume at price @xmath15 , which we will call the _ depth profile _ of the limit order book at any given time @xmath4 .",
    "the total stored limit order volume at price level @xmath15 is @xmath16 . for unit order size",
    "the shift in the best ask @xmath10 produced by a buy market order is given by solving the equation @xmath17 for @xmath18 . the shift in the best ask @xmath19 , where is the instantaneous price impact for buy market orders .",
    "a similar statement applies for sell market orders , where the price impact can be defined in terms of the shift in the best bid .",
    "( alternatively , it is also possible to define the price impact in terms of the change in the midpoint price )",
    ".    we will refer to a buy limit order whose limit price is greater than the best ask , or a sell limit order whose limit price is less than the best bid , as a _ crossing limit order _ or _",
    "marketable limit order_. such limit orders result in immediate transactions , with at least part of the order immediately executed .",
    "this model introduced in reference @xcite , is designed to be as analytically tractable as possible while capturing key features of the continuous double auction .",
    "all the order flows are modeled as poisson processes .",
    "we assume that market orders arrive in chunks of @xmath20 shares , at a rate of @xmath21 shares per unit time .",
    "the market order may be a ` buy ' order or a ` sell ' order with equal probability .",
    "( thus the rate at which buy orders or sell orders arrive individually is @xmath22 . )",
    "limit orders arrive in chunks of @xmath20 shares as well , at a rate @xmath23 shares per unit price and per unit time for buy orders and also for sell orders .",
    "offers are placed with uniform probability at integer multiples of a tick size @xmath13 in the range of price @xmath24 , and similarly for bids on @xmath25 .",
    "when a market order arrives it causes a transaction ; under the assumption of constant order size , a buy market order removes an offer at price @xmath10 , and if it was the last offer at that price , moves the best ask up to the next occupied price tick . similarly , a sell market order removes a bid at price @xmath11 , and if it is the last bid at that price , moves the best bid down to the next occupied price tick .",
    "in addition , limit orders may also be removed spontaneously by being canceled or by expiring , even without a transaction having taken place .",
    "we model this by letting them be removed randomly with constant probability @xmath26 per unit time .",
    "while the assumption of limit order placement over an infinite interval is clearly unrealistic , it provides a tractable boundary condition for modeling the behavior of the limit order book near the midpoint price @xmath27 , which is the region of interest since it is where transactions occur .",
    "limit orders far from the midpoint are usually canceled before they are executed ( we demonstrate this later in fig .",
    "[ effprof ] ) , and so far from the midpoint , limit order arrival and cancellation have a steady state behavior characterized by a simple poisson distribution .",
    "although under the limit order placement process the total number of orders placed per unit time is infinite , the order placement per unit price interval is bounded and thus the assumption of an infinite interval creates no problems .",
    "indeed , it guarantees that there are always an infinite number of limit orders of both signs stored in the book , so that the bid and ask are always well - defined and the book never empties .",
    "( under other assumptions about limit order placement this is not necessarily true , as we later demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw ] . )",
    "we are also considering versions of the model involving more realistic order placement functions ; see the discussion in section  [ subsec : futurework ] .    in this model ,",
    "to keep things simple , we are using the conceptual simplification of _ effective market orders _ and _ effective limit orders_. when a crossing limit order is placed part of it may be executed immediately .",
    "the effect of this part on the price is indistinguishable from that of a market order of the same size .",
    "similarly , given that this market order has been placed , the remaining part is equivalent to a non - crossing limit order of the same size .",
    "thus a crossing limit order can be modeled as an effective market order followed by an effective ( non - crossing ) limit order .",
    "working in terms of effective market and limit orders affects data analysis : the effective market order arrival rate @xmath21 combines both pure market orders and the immediately executed components of crossing limit orders , and similarly the limit order arrival rate @xmath23 corresponds only to the components of limit orders that are not executed immediately .",
    "this is consistent with the boundary conditions for the order placement process , since an offer with @xmath28 or a bid with @xmath29 would result in an immediate transaction , and thus would be effectively the same as a market order .",
    "defining the order placement process with these boundary conditions realistically allows limit orders to be placed anywhere inside the spread .",
    "another simplification of this model is the use of logarithmic prices , both for the order placement process and for the tick size @xmath13 .",
    "this has the important advantage that it ensures that prices are always positive . in real markets",
    "price ticks are linear , and the use of logarithmic price ticks is an approximation that makes both the calculations and the simulation more convenient .",
    "we find that the limit @xmath30 , where tick size is irrelevant , is a good approximation for many purposes .",
    "we find that tick size is less important than other parameters of the problem , which provides some justification for the approximation of logarithmic price ticks .",
    "assuming a constant probability for cancellation is clearly _ ad hoc _ , but in simulations we find that other assumptions with well - defined timescales , such as constant duration time , give similar results .",
    "for our analytic model we use a constant order size @xmath20 . in simulations",
    "we also use variable order size , e.g. half - normal distributions with standard deviation @xmath31 , which ensures that the mean value remains @xmath20 . as long as these distributions have thin tails ,",
    "the differences do not qualitatively affect most of the results reported here , except in a trivial way .",
    "as discussed in section [ subsec : futurework ] , decay processes without well - defined characteristic times and size distributions with power law tails give qualitatively different results and will be treated elsewhere .",
    "even though this model is simply defined , the time evolution is not trivial .",
    "one can think of the dynamics as being composed of three parts : ( 1 ) the buy market order / sell limit order interaction , which determines the best ask ; ( 2 ) the sell market order / buy limit order interaction , which determines the best bid ; and ( 3 ) the random cancellation process .",
    "processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) determine each others boundary conditions .",
    "that is , process ( 1 ) determines the best ask , which sets the boundary condition for limit order placement in process ( 2 ) , and process ( 2 ) determines the best bid , which determines the boundary conditions for limit order placement in process ( 1 ) .",
    "thus processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are strongly coupled .",
    "it is this coupling that causes the bid and ask to remain close to each other , and guarantees that the spread @xmath32 is a stationary random variable , even though the bid and ask are not .",
    "it is the coupling of these processes through their boundary conditions that provides the nonlinear feedback that makes the price process complex .",
    "there are two independent lines of prior work , one in the financial economics literature , and the other in the physics literature .",
    "the models in the economics literature are directed toward empirical analysis , and treat the order process as static .",
    "in contrast , the models in the physics literature are conceptual toy models , but they allow the order process to react to changes in prices , and are thus fully dynamic .",
    "our model bridges this gap .",
    "this is explained in more detail below .    the first model of this type that we are aware of was due to mendelson @xcite , who modeled random order placement with periodic clearing .",
    "this was developed along different directions by cohen _",
    "@xcite , who used techniques from queuing theory , but assumed only one price level and addressed the issue of time priority at that level ( motivated by the existence of a specialist who effectively pinned prices to make them stationary ) .",
    "domowitz and wang @xcite and bollerslev _ et al . _ @xcite further developed this to allow more general order placement processes that depend on prices , but without solving the full dynamical problem .",
    "this allows them to get a stationary solution for prices .",
    "in contrast , in our model the prices that emerge make a random walk , and so are much more realistic . in order to get a solution for the depth of the order book we have to go into price coordinates that co - move with the random walk .",
    "dealing with the feedback between order placement and prices makes the problem much more difficult , but it is key for getting reasonable results .    the models in the physics literature incorporate price dynamics , but have tended to be conceptual toy models designed to understand the anomalous diffusion properties of prices .",
    "this line of work begins with a paper by bak _",
    "@xcite which was developed by eliezer and kogan @xcite and by tang @xcite .",
    "they assume that limit orders are placed at a fixed distance from the midpoint , and that the limit prices of these orders are then randomly shuffled until they result in transactions .",
    "it is the random shuffling that causes price diffusion .",
    "this assumption , which we feel is unrealistic , was made to take advantage of the analogy to a standard reaction - diffusion model in the physics literature .",
    "maslov @xcite introduced an alterative model that was solved analytically in the mean - field limit by slanina @xcite .",
    "each order is randomly chosen to be either a buy or a sell , and either a limit order or a market order .",
    "if a limit order , it is randomly placed within a fixed distance of the current price .",
    "this again gives rise to anomalous price diffusion .",
    "a model allowing limit orders with poisson order cancellation was proposed by challet and stinchcombe @xcite .",
    "iori and chiarella @xcite have numerically studied a model including fundamentalists and technical traders .",
    "the model studied in this paper was introduced by daniels _",
    "this adds to the literature by introducing a model that treats the feedback between order placement and price movement , while having enough realism so that the parameters can be tested against real data .",
    "the prior models in the physics literature have tended to focus primarily on the anomalous diffusion of prices . while interesting and important for refining risk calculations , this is a second - order effect .",
    "in contrast , we focus on the first order effects of primary interest to market participants , such as the bid - ask spread , volatility , depth profile , price impact , and the probability and time to fill an order .",
    "we demonstrate how dimensional analysis becomes a useful tool in an economic setting , and develop mean field theories in a context that is more challenging than that of the toy models of previous work .",
    "subsequent to reference @xcite , bouchaud et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that , under the assumption that prices execute a random walk , by introducing an additional free parameter they can derive a simple equation for the depth profile . in this paper",
    "we show how to do this from first principles without introducing a free parameter .",
    "in this section we give an overview of the phenomenology of the model . because this model has five parameters , understanding all their effects",
    "would generally be a complicated problem in and of itself .",
    "this task is greatly simplified by the use of dimensional analysis , which reduces the number of independent parameters from five to two .",
    "thus , before we can even review the results , we need to first explain how dimensional analysis applies in this setting .",
    "one of the surprising aspects of this model is that one can derive several powerful results using the simple technique of dimensional analysis alone .",
    "dimensional analysis is a technique that is commonly used in physics and engineering to reduce the number of independent degrees of freedom by taking advantage of the constraints imposed by dimensionality . for sufficiently constrained problems",
    "it can be used to guess the answer to a problem without doing a full analysis .",
    "the idea is to write down all the factors that a given phenomenon can depend on , and then find the combination that has the correct dimensions .",
    "for example , consider the problem of the period of a pendulum : the period @xmath33 has dimensions of _ time_. obvious candidates that it might depend on are the mass of the bob @xmath34 ( which has units of _ mass _ ) , the length @xmath35 ( which has units of _ distance _ ) , and the acceleration of gravity @xmath36 ( which has units of @xmath37 ) .",
    "there is only one way to combine these to produce something with dimensions of _ time _ ,",
    "i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "this determines the correct formula for the period of a pendulum up to a constant .",
    "note that it makes it clear that the period does not depend on the mass , a result that is not obvious _",
    "a priori_. we were lucky in this problem because there were three parameters and three dimensions , with a unique combination of the parameters having the right dimensions ; in general dimensional analysis can only be used to reduce the number of free parameters through the constraints imposed by their dimensions .    for this problem",
    "the three fundamental dimensions in the model are _ shares _ , _ price _ , and _",
    "time_. note that by _ price _ , we mean the logarithm of price ; as long as we are consistent , this does not create problems with the dimensional analysis .",
    "there are five parameters : three rate constants and two discreteness parameters .",
    "the _ order flow rates _ are @xmath21 , the market order arrival rate , with dimensions of _ shares per time _ ; @xmath23 , the limit order arrival rate per unit price , with dimensions of _ shares per price per time _ ; and @xmath26 , the rate of limit order decays , with dimensions of _ 1/time_. these play a role similar to rate constants in physical problems .",
    "the two _ discreteness parameters _ are the price tick size @xmath13 , with dimensions of _ price _ , and the order size @xmath20 , with dimensions of _ shares_. this is summarized in table  [ tab : parameters ] .       the corresponding buy limit - order addition cases",
    "are given in table  [ tab : buy_lim_ord_add ] , and their positive - shift contribution to @xmath39 turns out to be the same as that from removal of sell limit orders  ( [ eq : sell_lim_ord_rem_src ] ) .",

    "<S> most modern financial markets use a continuous double auction mechanism to store and match orders and facilitate trading . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we develop a microscopic dynamical statistical model for the continuous double auction under the assumption of iid random order flow , and analyze it using simulation , dimensional analysis , and theoretical tools based on mean field approximations . </S>",
    "<S> the model makes testable predictions for basic properties of markets , such as price volatility , the depth of stored supply and demand vs. price , the bid - ask spread , the price impact function , and the time and probability of filling orders . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions are based on properties of order flow and the limit order book , such as share volume of market and limit orders , cancellations , typical order size , and tick size . because these quantities can all be measured directly there are no free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the order size , which can be cast as a nondimensional granularity parameter , is in most cases a more significant determinant of market behavior than tick size . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide an explanation for the observed highly concave nature of the price impact function . on a broader level , this work suggests how stochastic models based on zero - intelligence agents may be useful to probe the structure of market institutions . like the model of perfect rationality , a stochastic - zero intelligence model can be used to make strong predictions based on a compact set of assumptions , even if these assumptions are not fully believable . </S>"
