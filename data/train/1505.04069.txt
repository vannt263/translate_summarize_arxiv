    "this region of hot gas is highly over - pressurized relative to its surrounding ambient ism and will expand along the steepest pressure gradients .",
    "as it expands , it sweeps up and shocks ambient material , creating an outflowing  superwind \" @xcite . contributing to this overall energy driven outflow",
    "is the radiation pressure on dust grains that are likely coupled to the ionized gas within the flow @xcite .",
    "there is a significant amount of morphological , physical and kinematic evidence for the existence of superwinds in nearby starburst and infrared luminous galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "large- scale optical emission - line and associated x - ray nebulae are ubiquitous in starbursts @xcite , and these increase in size and luminosity from dwarf starbursts to ulirgs , where they can be tens of kpc in size @xcite .",
    "in addition , the winds are observed in molecular lines such as co @xcite and blue - shifted absorption features ( e.g. nad ) seen projected against the starburst nuclei @xcite indicating that the neutral , cold ism is being swept - up in the outflow . recently , vigorous outflows have also been detected in ulirgs and lirgs in molecular absorption lines with @xmath12 which suggest very high mass outflow rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", m82 affords an unparalleled opportunity to study a dusty outflow in great detail .",
    "the outflow in m82 has extensive and complex extra - planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) and h@xmath2 emission , evident from the @xmath13 irac and @xmath14irs observations presented in @xcite .",
    "extensive pah emission is also seen at @xmath15 m in the akari data @xcite .",
    "pahs are thought to be the origin of strong , broad emission features arising in the mid - infrared spectra of star forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we mapped an area of approximately 5 arcmin@xmath25 above and below the plane of m82 .",
    "we used cubism @xcite to build sl and ll spectral cubes from from the spitzer - irs basic calibration data ( bcds ) . in order to create and subtract a local background from the wind spectra , we observed a region 20 kpc north of the m82 disk with both irs modules .",
    "this region was observed with the same parameters ( integration time per pixel and cycles per position ) that were used for the wind . after verifying that no line , pah or dust continuum was visible in the off field , we subtracted an average image created from this region from the wind data at each location and for each irs module before building the spectral cubes .",
    "we used pahfit @xcite to create maps of spectral lines and pah features .",
    "pahfit is a spectral fitting routine that decomposes irs low - resolution spectra into broad pah features , unresolved line emission , and continuum emission from dust grains .",
    "pahfit allows for the deblending of overlapping features , in particular the pah emission , silicate absorption and fine - structure atomic , and warm h@xmath2 emission lines . because it performs a simultaneous fit to the emission features and the underlying continuum , pahfit works best if it can fit combined sl and ll spectra across the full @xmath26 m range .",
    "in order to provide a stable long wavelength continuum from which to estimate the true pah emission , including the broad feature wings , we formed a combined sl + ll cube . in order to investigate the spatial variations of the h@xmath6 ratio at the maximum resolution we decided to rotate and regrid the ll cubes to match the orientation and pixel size of the sl cubes ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus we provide a stable long - term extrapolation of the ll fit to the sl fit . by calculating the flux in the new ll cubes using a bilinear interpolation ( in surface brightness units )",
    ", we assure that the flux over the native sl pixel scale is conserved .",
    "finally , we applied a small correction factor to each individual sl spectrum , necessary to match the continuum in the corresponding ll spectrum .",
    "this scale factor ranges between @xmath28 , and was calculated by comparing pixels in the spectral overlap region between sl and ll at approximately @xmath29 m .",
    "this scale factor is applied before running pahfit on the combined sl + ll cubes .",
    "such scaling is commonly observed in spatially extended sources as a result of the different entrance slit dimensions of the sl and ll spectrograph modules . in figure  [ pahfitfig ] we present an example of the spectral decomposition performed at every location of the map with pahfit .",
    "the output of pahfit is saved for each feature , and is used to create all the maps ( pah , h@xmath2 , [ neii ] and [ neiii ] ) at the native resolution of the sl data as shown in figure  [ pahmapfig ] .",
    "although care was taken to avoid the fir - bright nucleus of m82 during the spectral mapping , the ll1 data exhibit a `` ripple '' pattern that varies spatially and spectrally , and the ll2 data have a slightly elevated continuum level in some pixels ( compared to sl1 ) .",
    "we believe both of these to be the effect of light scattered into the nuclear irs entrance slits .",
    "therefore we have opted not to use the ll1 data in the fitting and analysis , except for the derivation of an upper limit on the h@xmath2 s(0 ) line flux , calculated as the @xmath30 noise level at @xmath31 m .",
    "we have excluded regions of the ll2 data cubes where the implied scale factor in the continuum between sl1 and ll2 is greater than 2.0 .",
    "in figure  [ pahmapfig ] we present the total pah emission map calculated by summing over all the pah bands between @xmath32 m , the [ neii]12.8@xmath19 m flux map derived from the sl data cubes , the total h@xmath2 map derived from the sl and ll2 cubes , and the [ neiii]15.6@xmath19 m emission map .",
    "we find widespread emission with significant structure in all of the line maps . to the north ,",
    "both pah and [ neii ] exhibit two prominent , broad radial filaments . to the south",
    ", the pah map shows a complex structure with a bubble , or loop .",
    "this loop is also seen in the [ neii ] map .",
    "the overall morphologies of the warm h@xmath2 and h@xmath33 are generally very similar , as seen in the nir by @xcite .",
    "maps of the cold molecular gas made in co ( j=1 - 0 ) by @xcite are at lower spatial resolution , but also show extended , extraplanar gas",
    ".    we can study the physical properties of the ionized gas and pahs by mapping the ratios between ionized lines such as [ neiii]/[neii ] and between the different pah bands . if the ionized gas is photoionized , the ne line ratio is sensitive to the hardness of the radiation field and the ionization parameter .",
    "the ne ratios observed in the outflow are standard values for the hardness of the radiation field found in starburst galaxies .",
    "the ratio of the 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.3 micron pah features can be used to estimate the ionization state and the size of the small dust grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even the overall absence of pah emission may be related to the ionization state of the gas since we do not expect gas emitting strongly in [ neiii ] to show much pah emission , as the small grains are easily destroyed by energetic photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the 11.3@xmath19m/7.7@xmath19 m ratio is high when pahs are more neutral and larger , while the 6.2@xmath19m/7.7@xmath19 m pah ratio is high when pah grains are smaller .",
    "however , we caution that variations in the pah line ratios are also influenced by the structural properties and elemental abundances in small particles giving rise to the pah features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure  [ ratiomapsfig ] we present maps of the pah 11.3/7.7 and 6.2/7.7 ratios , the h@xmath6 ratio and the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio .",

    "although there is a great deal of structure in the pah ratio maps , the general trend is that the 11.3/7.7 and the 6.2/7.7 ratios increase as we move away from the starburst disk .",
    "the pah 11.3/7.7 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath35 and the pah 6.2/7.7 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath36 at the northern edge of the outflow compared to the regions near the center of the starburst disk .",

    "the h@xmath6 ratio varies between @xmath38 , and the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio varies between @xmath39 . in the region between the pah emission `` fingers '' ( as particularly evident in the northen outflow region in figure  [ pahmapfig ] ) , both maps show an enhancement of the ratio .    in figure  [ ratiomapsfig ]",
    "we also mark the 12 regions from which we have extracted @xmath40 m spectra and performed multi - temperature fits to the h@xmath2 lines .",
    "we show these spectra in figure  [ spectrumfig ] .",
    "these regions were chosen to represent the full range of h@xmath6 ratios and to approximately sample the full spatial extent of the outflow .",
    "for comparison , we also show an integrated spectrum of the center of m82 ( figure  [ spectrumfig ] ; * ? ? ? * ) , which we use as a reference .",
    "in addition to the 12 regions , we also show a composite spectrum of the entire irs map in figure  [ spectrumfig ] .",
    "we measure the fluxes of the pah features between @xmath32 m , the fine - structure lines [ neii ] and [ neiii ] , and the rotational excitation lines of h@xmath2 from s(0 ) to s(3 ) and present the results in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "regions 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 are the most similar to the reference spectrum in slope and the relative strength of pah features , which is not surprising since they are located close to the center .",
    "pahs are also strong in regions 3 , 8 , 10 , 11 and 12 , but their spectrum also exhibits a flatter continuum , probably indicating the presence of colder dust .",
    "region 3 is the most distant from the central starburst and it has the weakest pah emission .",
    "region 4 exhibits a flat continuum , but a comparatively strong pah @xmath41 m feature .",
    "as we have seen in the maps , the spectra show strong variations of the h@xmath6 ratios between the regions .",
    "the h@xmath42 line is very prominent in the spectrum of region 3 compared to the pah bands , while in the regions close to the disk , such as regions 7 and 9 , this line is much fainter compared to the pah features . indeed , using the values in tables 1 and 2 , we calculate in region 3 a very high h@xmath43 , while in region 9 , h@xmath44 .    in figure  [ drainefig ]",
    "we present a plot of the pah 11.3/7.7 ratio as a function of the 6.2/7.7 pah ratio .",

    "in general , the outflow has stronger @xmath46 m pah and h@xmath2 emission than the sb disk , and the spectrum in the region 2 kpc north of the disk ( the blue spectrum shown in figure  [ drainefig ] ) has higher @xmath46 m feature and h@xmath2 s(1 ) flux , indicating the prevalence of larger pah grains and enhanced h@xmath2 emission further away from the disk . in summary",

    "emission arises predominantly from the starburst disk , this traces the relative h@xmath2 and pah emission as a function of distance from the starburst .",
    "this ratio has been previously used by @xcite and @xcite to show the relative importance of the uv versus mechanical heating of the gas .",
    "we can see that the h@xmath6 ratio decreases with increasing [ neii ] flux .",
    "the vast majority of the mapped regions lie well above the values seen in star - forming galaxies in the local universe ( the dashed lines - see @xcite ) .",
    "the h@xmath6 ratio values span two orders - of - magnitude , 0.01 - 1 .",
    "most of the m82 wind points have h@xmath6 between 0.01 and 0.10 , but @xmath47% have extreme values , h@xmath6 @xmath48 .",
    "the fact that the h@xmath6 ratios seen in the wind are well above those seen in the sb disk , the normal galaxies observed by @xcite , and pdr models of @xcite ( see section 4 ) suggests that the h@xmath2 is not solely excited by stellar radiation from the starburst .",
    "we can also investigate possible correlations of the h@xmath6 ratio with diagnostics of the atomic gas and the size and ionization state of the grains . in figure  [ h2pahfig2 ]",
    ", we show h@xmath6 as a function of the pah 11.3/7.7 ratio , the pah 6.2/7.7 ratio , the h@xmath2 s(3)/s(1 ) ratio , and the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio .",
    "we see that in the disk the h@xmath6 ratio increases with increasing pah 11.3/7.7 ratio . while the trend of increasing h@xmath6 in the wind is similar to that seen in the disk , the wind values extend to much larger values of both 11.3/7.7 pah and h@xmath6 than seen in the starburst .",
    "the scatter to high h@xmath6 and a much larger range in the 6.2/7.7 ratio is seen in the upper right panel of figure  [ h2pahfig2 ] as well . in the lower left",
    ", we observe an anti - correlation between h@xmath6 and s(3)/s(1 ) in the disk as warmer gas has lower h@xmath6 .",
    "the wind points seem consistent with this trend but the uncertainties are large .",
    "this general lack of very warm molecular gas and high h@xmath6 ratios in the wind may be a function of inability of the mir diagnostic features to probe the hottest gas .",
    "the [ neiii]/[neii ] also increases with h@xmath6 in the disk , and the wind points to the north seem consistent with the trend , but clearly there are many wind points in a few regions in the northern outflow which have much higher h@xmath6 ratios than seen in the disk at a given [ neiii]/[neii ] value .    to further help us understand what drives the variations of the h@xmath6 flux ratios , we present maps of h@xmath2/[neii ] and pah/[neii ] in figure  [ neratiomapsfig ] .",
    "in general , the regions with high h@xmath6 correspond to high pah/[neii ] , suggesting that it is not simply a decreasing pah that causes the rise in h@xmath6 off the plane of m82 . only in the northern edge of the map",
    "do we see a lower pah/[neii ] ratio , which might indicate reduced pah heating efficiency .",
    "it is important to note , however , that while the pah/[neii ] ratio does change by factors of a few across the map , this is much less than the variation observed in h@xmath6 .",

    "in fact , models suggest that the large values of the h@xmath6 ratios observed in some regions ( @xmath560.1 ) can not be explained by photo - ionization @xcite",
    ".    the h@xmath2 gas could be indirectly excited by x - rays emitted from the expanding bubble of hot and tenuous gas generated by the intense star formation within m82 @xcite , high velocity shocks in the entrained gas , x - rays due to inverse compton scattering of ir photons . in m82 ,",
    "the x - ray emission covers approximately the same region as the optical emission line filaments @xcite and radio emission @xcite .",
    "for example , the high h@xmath6 in the northern tip @xmath625 kpc from the disk , appears to be associated with a region with x - ray emission ( figure  [ xrayfig ] ) .",
    "we can use the total h@xmath1 luminosity and the total x - ray luminosity in the outflow to calculate the h@xmath2-to - x - ray luminosity ratio @xcite .",
    "the h to h@xmath2 transition can occur at relatively low column densities , n@xmath6310@xmath64 @xmath65 . at such low columns",
    ", even relatively soft x - rays can penetrate .",
    "our estimates for the m82 outflow are @xmath66 kev@xmath67 @xcite and @xmath68kev@xmath69 @xcite , over the northern and southern @xmath70 map . using xdr models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can estimate whether the h@xmath2 line emission could be powered by x - ray heating , following the procedure described in @xcite . in these models",
    ", @xmath71 of the absorbed x - ray flux goes into gas heating via photoelectrons , and the cooling by h@xmath2 rotational lines in xdr models is @xmath72% of the total gas cooling for a gas temperature of 200 k. at this temperature , the ratio of the first four rotational lines to the total rotational line luminosity is l(h@xmath2 00 s(0)s(3))/ l(h@xmath2 ) = 0.6 . combining the above factors",
    ", we estimate a maximum h@xmath2 to x - ray luminosity ratio of l ( h@xmath2 00 s(0)s(3))/ l@xmath73 ( 210 kev ) @xmath74 @xcite . this upper limit on the h@xmath2-to - x - ray luminosity is conservative because it assumes that all the x - ray flux is absorbed by the molecular gas , which is likely not the case ( since the medium in which x - rays propagate is inhomogeneous ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that x - rays are not the dominant source of heating of the h@xmath2 gas in the m82 wind , since the observed ratios are well above those found in xdr models .",
    "this is also seen in some extreme environments , such as powerful radio galaxies , where h@xmath6 @xmath75 and the h@xmath2/x - ray ratio also exceeds that expected from xdrs alone @xcite .",
    "ambient gas clouds heated by the mechanical energy of the wind and dense shell fragments from the wind bubble carried along by the wind are the two main sources of x - ray emission in the wind @xcite . in figure  [ xrayfig ]",
    "we show the contours of soft x - ray emission from the outflow of m82 overlaid on the h@xmath6 and total ( @xmath76 m ) pah maps .",
    "the x - ray and pah maps show a remarkable correlation , particularly in the southern part of the bi - conical outflow , although both maps are projections of the true 3d structure and the precise locations of the hot gas and dust grains are unknown . moreover , there are regions of high surface brightness x - ray emission with relatively little pah emission ( in the north along the outer wind axis ) .",
    "we also see that the middle lobe of x - ray emission in the northern outflow , at about 5 kpc from the disk , appears related to the increase of h@xmath77pah@xmath34 m surface brightness .",
    "the morphology of h@xmath6 closely resembles the morphology of the h@xmath2 ( @xmath78m)/pah maps in @xcite .",
    "the regions where h@xmath79 correspond to regions where h@xmath2 ( @xmath78m)/pah@xmath80 .",
    "while there is a reasonable spatial correlation between the surface brightness distribution of the soft x - ray and h@xmath2 emission , a correlation is apparent between soft x - rays surface brightness and h@xmath6 ratio distributions only in high surface brightness x - ray emitting regions .",
    "there are several possibilities why this might be so , but",
    "the most obvious is that both the x - ray and h@xmath2 emission are fundamentally powered by the same mechanism , namely , the very hot plasma that is acting as the `` piston '' driving the wind and heating clouds entrained in the wind .",
    "however , the warm h@xmath2 and hot x - ray emitting plasma should not be co - spatial on small scales , and instead the h@xmath2 is likely seen in projection against the hot wind , along the edges of the cone in dense knots of gas , heated by shocks ( see below ) .",
    "such a situation would also arise in gas with a wide range of densities or through changes as individual clouds are shredded as they are accelerated by the action of the piston @xcite .",
    "this is also shown by the strong correlation between the x - rays and the pah emission ( figure  [ xrayfig]b ) , especially in the southern wind . as the pahs and h@xmath2 molecules can not be expected to survive within the @xmath81 x - ray emitting plasma ,",
    "it is most likely that they lie along the edges of this phase of the outflow .",
    "so while the power source is likely the same , the two emission regions , not surprisingly , represent different physical regions and gas states being impacted by the driving very hot plasma @xcite .",
    "kinematics of the gas can be used to determine if the different gas phases observed in the outflowing wind are related .",
    "if the observed kinematics of the warm molecular gas as probed by the h@xmath2 rotational lines is similar to that of the cold molecular gas as probed by the co lines , the ir atomic neutral and ionized emission lines , or the lines of the warm ionized medium , then this might suggest a direct physical relationship between these phases .",
    "@xcite derived a velocity of 160 km / s for the co(1 - 0 ) emitting gas for the northern outflow region .",
    "however , the farthest extent of the co emission is only about 1 arc minute north of the disk of m82 , while the irs map extends to 4 arcmin .",
    "the velocity derived by @xcite is not very different from the velocities in the neutral and ionized atomic gas in the infrared within the inner wind region @xmath82 arcmin from the disk @xcite .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the inner wind region within a few arc minutes of the plane of m82 , the velocities in the warm ionized gas are only a few 100 km s@xmath8 or less within a couple of arc minutes of the disk of m82 @xcite .",
    "these velocities are consistent with those observed in ir neutral and ionized atomic lines @xcite . however , farther out of the plane of m82 , much higher outflow velocities ( @xmath62600 - 800 km s@xmath8 ) are observed in h@xmath33 for the outflow in m82 @xcite .",
    "line splitting is observed in both the co and h@xmath33 with similar velocities @xcite , making the association between the cold molecular gas and the warm ionized gas stronger ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    such a direct relationship would be consistent with a picture where the emission we observe in the extended outflow of m82 is mainly from entrained and swept - up clouds that are predominately shock - heated by a high ram - pressure , hot plasma generated within the starburst region .",
    "if we envision the regions of warm h@xmath2 emission as being the areas in the clouds that are shock - heated by the expanding plasma , we would expect these phases to co - exist with the warm ionized gas @xcite and the cold / warm molecular gas .",
    "assuming that the velocity of the warm h@xmath2 is similar to the deprojected velocity of the cold molecular gas derived by @xcite , we can calculate its total kinetic energy as @xmath83 erg for @xmath84 and @xmath85=160 km s@xmath8 .",
    "our estimates are considerably higher than those of @xcite because both their mass estimates are a factor of 500 less and they assumed a velocity of 100 km s@xmath8 for the warm molecular emission .",
    "however , they are smaller compared to those estimated for the cold molecular and warm ionized medium .",
    "@xcite estimate that the kinetic energy of the wind in the cold molecular gas is @xmath8610@xmath87 erg .",
    "@xcite estimate a kinetic energy of @xmath883@xmath5710@xmath89 erg , but they do not map the co distribution out to large distances from the disk compared to @xcite .",
    "the hot plasma driving the outflow will likely transfer part of its ram and thermal pressure to swept - up and entrained dense molecular gas by driving shocks and by turbulent mixing between hot and cold gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "to model such shocks , we use a grid of stationary shock models computed with an updated version of the @xcite code to derive the physical shock parameters that explain the h@xmath2 line ratios .",
    "our initial conditions are that the gas is diffuse , magnetized with a pre - shock magnetic field of intensity @xmath90 = \\sqrt{n_h[\\rm cm^{-3}]}$ ] , and irradiated with a radiation field of @xmath91 in habing units . as the  habing field \" would photodissociate the h@xmath2 , we assume some self - shielding . in the models ,",
    "we integrate the extinction along the model from the pre - shock , and we take into account the shielding and self - shielding , which is parametrized in the photo - dissociation reaction rates of h@xmath2 and co @xcite . at a density of @xmath92 @xmath10 , the ionization fraction in the pre - shock gas is @xmath93 .",
    "this matches approximately our estimate of the ionization fraction of @xmath94 at 10 kpc from the x - ray source .",
    "we fit the h@xmath2 line fluxes observed in the different regions with one shock or a combination of two shock velocities depending on how many h@xmath2 lines are detected , for three different pre - shock densities : @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath92  @xmath10 , ( see @xcite for details of the method ) .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in figure  [ h2figshock ] , where we present the h@xmath2 excitation diagrams for the best velocity combinations ( lowest @xmath97 ) , and for the intermediate pre - shock density of n@xmath98 = 10@xmath99 @xmath10 .",
    "we present in table  [ h2tab2 ] the results of the shock models for each region and the integrated spectrum ( labeled `` total '' ) .",
    "the total gas mass derived from the shock models is @xmath100 , which results in an estimate of the kinetic energy of @xmath101 erg .",
    "this is a factor of 3 higher than the estimates calculated in the temperature diagrams of figure  [ h2fig1 ] .",
    "this difference arises due to the fact that we are integrating the postshock temperature profile down to 50 k ( where the h@xmath2 mid - ir lines start to emit ) , and because local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) is not assumed in the shock models .    for all regions ,",
    "the best - fit shock velocities are in the range 4 - 35 km s@xmath8 ( grid spans 3 - 40 km s@xmath8 ; tabl  [ h2tab2 ] ) .",
    "these velocities are much lower than the estimated bulk outflow velocity @xcite .",
    "the regions show a range of best fitting models , but typically the best fitting pre - shock densities are n@xmath98=100 - 1000 @xmath10 .",
    "our modeling is not intended to be exhaustive , but to simply provide an estimate of the physical parameters in the warm molecular gas of the outflow .    at the range of preshock densities and magnetic field strengths",
    "considered , the c - shocks turn into j - shocks when the velocities are above @xmath102 km s@xmath8 .",
    "for some regions the h@xmath2 line fluxes are reproduced by a combination of two c - shocks , in other regions the c - shocks ( j - shocks ) do not sufficiently populate the highest ( lowest ) energy levels . in those cases , we fit the h@xmath2 line fluxes by a combination of c- and j - shocks .",
    "the shocks travel through the clouds in @xmath103 years ( for 1 pc clouds ) , which is much shorter than the dynamical time of the outflow ( @xmath104 yrs - @xcite ) . using the estimates of the warm molecular gas mass and the typical cooling time of the shocked h@xmath2 gas ( @xmath105 yr for @xmath106 @xmath10 ) ,",
    "we can estimate the mass flow of shocked gas , @xmath107 yr @xmath108 yr@xmath8 , assuming that all the warm h@xmath2 is shock - heated . the dynamical timescale of the h@xmath2-rich outflow is @xmath109 kpc@xmath110 km s@xmath111 yr implying a total mass of shocked gas @xmath112 .",
    "this estimate is likely to be an upper limit since the h@xmath2 gas may not extend over the whole outflow and because this assumes that the gas is only shocked once , which is highly unlikely .",
    "the high mass flow rate of shocked gas may require the reformation of h@xmath2 in the post - shocked gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to prolong the survival time of the h@xmath2 gas in the outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "clouds may also survive longer if the radiative cooling time is shorter than the time scale necessary for the shocks to cross the cloud and the growth rate of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities @xcite .",
    "such processes would lower the total molecular mass required to explain the molecular emission from the outflow , although for the c shocks considered here and even for many of the j shocks as well , there is little destruction of h@xmath2 . at any rate , the total gas mass that is shock heated is similar to that of the cold molecular gas .",
    "therefore the reservoir for the shocked gas is likely the cold molecular gas as probed through the co emission from the wind .      since we see that the pahs grains are on average larger and more ionized in the wind , it is natural to ask whether or not some of the enhanced h@xmath6 could be do to a reduction in the pah emission , rather than an enhancement of h@xmath2 . the decrease in pah flux",
    "is probably just due to a decrease of the radiation field , but there is also a change in the grain properties associated with the wind .",
    "the gradient of decrease in h@xmath2 emission is significantly lower than that of the pah emission , suggesting an additional heating source for the h@xmath2 ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "one of the ways pah emission can decrease relative to h@xmath2 is pah destruction .",
    "pah grains can be destroyed either by hard radiation field , x - rays , or shocks .",
    "the ews of the pah features in starburst galaxies are observed to decrease sharply when [ neiii]@xmath113m/[neii]@xmath114m@xmath115 , where [ neiii]/[neii ] traces the hardness of the radiation field .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence of pah destruction by intense radiation fields @xcite . in m82 , despite an increase of [ neiii]@xmath113m/[neii]@xmath114 m in the outflow , in most of the outflow [ neiii]@xmath113m/[neii]@xmath114 m remains less than 1 .",
    "[ neiii]@xmath113m/[neii]@xmath114m@xmath116 indicates that there is hard ( @xmath117 ev ) radiation present , but not enough to have an effect on the average pah properties .",
    "furthermore , only a small fraction of the gas in the m82 outflow is photoionized , and pahs may survive in hi and h@xmath2 gas .",
    "pah destruction is also very sensitive to the clumping factor of the gas .",
    "if the gas is dense and clumpy with relatively small volume filling factor and large covering fraction , the pah grains will be shielded from the hard photons in the radiation field .",
    "so pah destruction by hard photons is not likely to be the cause of the increase of h@xmath2/pah in the wind .",
    "pah grains are rapidly destroyed in hot , x - ray emitting gas @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of pahs at large distances ( 10 kpc from the disk ) in the outflow shows that they are protected in cooler phases of the gas , mostly in molecular gas .",
    "it is possible , however , that x - rays from the hot outflow fluid could destroy the pah carriers , but the correlation between the x - ray emitting gas and the pah maps , particularly in the southern outflow , suggests that grain destruction by x - rays in the wind is not dominant .",
    "thermal collisions with very small and big grains can have a significant impact on the cooling of the hot gas ejected into the halo @xcite .",
    "however , the impact of this cooling will generally be short lived since the cooling efficiency drops as the grain sputtering occurs in the hot gas @xcite , unless the hot halo gas is constantly replenished with dusty gas . a physical dust cooling model is needed to fully assess whether thermal emission from collisionally heated dust in the hot plasma is a significant contribution to the gas cooling in the halo of m82 , and whether this contribution changes as a function of the radius .",
    "another possible mechanism for pah destruction is shocks .",
    "as seen in figure  [ h2figshock ] , the h@xmath2 emission that we see can be fit with shock models having speeds of up to 40 km s@xmath8 .",
    "pah destruction likely only becomes relevant for shock velocities @xmath56100 km s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that the low velocity shocks that heat the molecular gas and enhace the h2 emission are also destroying the pah grains , although we clearly see a change in the grain population .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that shocks do not dominate the [ cii ] and [ oi ] emission in the wind .",
    "overall , the enhancement in h@xmath6 is likely caused by h@xmath2 excitation by shocks , although we can not rule out a relatively small effect due to pah destruction .",
    "in dense molecular clouds , where the pah destruction by shocks is less efficient , cosmic rays are the most efficient source of destruction of pah molecules , mostly because of their bombardment by energetic ions @xcite .",
    "this is likely to play an important role in the m82 wind , because the intense star formation in m82 is likely to enhance the cosmic ray intensity by a factor of @xmath118 compared to the milky way @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that crs can destroy pahs in dense molecular clouds , but in these environments the heating will also be very inefficient , causing a reduction of pah emission .",
    "@xcite showed that only pahs with a number of carbon atoms greater than @xmath119 have a survival lifetime greater than the circulation time scale of the outflow ( @xmath120  yr ) .",
    "thus , there may be a size - selection effect of pahs in the outflow , which is roughly consistent with the size inferred from the band ratios ( we mostly see pah @xmath121 , meaning an average size greater than 250 carbon atoms , see figure  [ drainefig ] ) , and cosmic rays are likely to play a role .",
    "the calculations of micelotta et al .",
    "2010 show that any pah shocked at @xmath122 km / s should be destroyed . to be re - formed in the post - shock gas , an efficient and fast re - formation process is needed .",
    "pahs are a product of high temperature chemistry involving abundant carbon bearing precursors such as ch@xmath123 and c@xmath2h@xmath2 . in the cooled postshock gas",
    "these precursor species are likely not very abundant . in the cold neutral medium ,",
    "the global pah coagulation timescale is of the order of 100 myr , much longer than the outflow dynamical time @xcite .",
    "akari results from @xcite suggest that very small grains still exist in the halo .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that pah are produced in the disk , carried up in the outflow , and `` protected '' from fast shocks in the denser material .",
    "if molecular clouds are formed in the postshock gas in the outflow , then there may be pah coagulation over timescales comparable to the outflow time ( coagulation timescales are of the order of a few myr in molecular clouds ) , but it should be very small fraction of the volume , contrary to what is observed .    in conclusion ,",
    "the enhancement of the h@xmath2/pah is likely caused by h@xmath2 shock excitation , although we can not rule out a relatively small effect due to pah destruction .",
    "* we have mapped the northern and southern superwind in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 using the @xmath20-irs .",
    "we find strong h@xmath2 , pah and ne line emission that extends over nearly 5 arcminutes above and below the plane of the galaxy , and have measured the variation of the h@xmath6 , [ neiii]/[neii ] and pah feature ratios throughout the wind .",
    "* we estimate a total warm ( @xmath124 k ) molecular gas mass to be between @xmath125 and the total kinetic energy of the warm molecular outflow to be between @xmath126 erg assuming an outflow velocity @xmath85=160 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the warm molecular gas provides about 0.5 - 5% of the kinetic energy ",
    "comparable to that observed in the atomic gas .",
    "* there are clear variations in the pah band ratios throughout the wind .",
    "the 6.2/7.7 and 11.3/7.7 micron pah band flux ratios , when compared to models , suggest a higher fraction of larger and/or more ionized pahs in the wind compared to the starburst disk , especially in the northern part of the wind . * the warm molecular gas",
    "to pah ratio ( h@xmath6 ) is enhanced in the outflow by factors of 10 - 100 as compared to the starburst disk .",
    "this enhancement in the h@xmath6 ratio does not seem to follow the trends with the ionization of the atomic gas ( as measured with the [ neiii]/[neii ] line flux ratio ) seen in the starburst .",
    "our results indicate that uv and x - ray emission are probably not the dominant excitation mechanisms of h@xmath2 .",
    "models suggest the observed values could be reproduced with slow c- and j - shocks ( @xmath7 km s@xmath8 ) driven into dense molecular gas entrained in the outflow . using a dynamical timescale of the h@xmath2-rich outflow of about 10@xmath127 years results in an upper limit of 5@xmath5710@xmath128 m@xmath4 of molecular gas heated and shocked over the lifetime of the wind . given the rate at which the gas must be shocked , the reservoir for this shocked gas is the cold molecular gas as observed in co. * the emission from all of these phases is likely due to clouds entrained in and accelerated by the flow .",
    "they are being shock heated by the hot plasma with high ram pressure generated by the collective thermalization of stellar winds and supernova in the starburst region of m82 .",
    "these clouds are multiphase and the variation in properties are likely due to a range of shock velocities which depend on the density of the pre - shocked gas which depend on the density of the pre - shocked gas .",

    "<S> we have mapped the superwind / halo region of the nearby starburst galaxy m82 in the mid - infrared with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral regions covered include the h@xmath1 , [ neii ] , [ neiii ] emission lines and pah features . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the total warm h@xmath2 mass and the kinetic energy of the outflowing warm molecular gas to be between @xmath3 m@xmath4 and @xmath5 erg . using the ratios of the 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.3 micron pah features in the irs spectra , we are able to estimate the average size and ionization state of the small grains in the superwind </S>",
    "<S> . there are large variations in the pah flux ratios throughout the outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the 11.3/7.7 and the 6.2/7.7 pah ratios both vary by more than a factor of five across the wind region . </S>",
    "<S> the northern part of the wind has a significant population of pah s with smaller 6.2/7.7 ratios than either the starburst disk or the southern wind , indicating that on average , pah emitters are larger and more ionized . </S>",
    "<S> the warm molecular gas to pah flux ratios ( h@xmath6 ) are enhanced in the outflow by factors of 10 - 100 as compared to the starburst disk . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement in the h@xmath6 ratio does not seem to follow the ionization of the atomic gas ( as measured with the [ neiii]/[neii ] line flux ratio ) in the outflow . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that much of the warm h@xmath2 in the outflow is excited by shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the observed h@xmath2 line intensities can be reproduced with low velocity shocks ( @xmath7 km s@xmath8 ) driven into moderately dense molecular gas ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) entrained in the outflow .
