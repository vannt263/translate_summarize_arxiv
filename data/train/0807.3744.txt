    "star clusters are powerful tools for probing the star - formation history and the associated chemical evolution of a galaxy . as one of the closest star forming galaxies with star clusters covering a wide range of ages , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is a preferred location for detailed studies of this class of objects .",
    "the smc is the only dwarf galaxy in the local group containing populous intermediate - age star clusters of all ages .",
    "the smc appears to be part of a triple system together with the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "its star formation activity may be triggered by interactions with its companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the proximity of the smc allows us to resolve individual stars in compact and massive star clusters of intermediate and old age , down to the sub - solar stellar mass regime .",
    "the globular cluster ( gc ) system of the mw exhibits a range of ages between @xmath010.5 and 14  gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the oldest populations belonging to the most ancient surviving stellar systems . in the galactic halo , a ",
    "young  group of star clusters is found with pal1 being the youngest with an age of @xmath4  gyr @xcite .",
    "theories explaining the origin of these so - called young halo clusters , consider them to have been captured by the mw @xcite , to have been formed during interactions between the mw and the magellanic clouds @xcite , or to have been accreted from destroyed and/or merged dwarf satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the star formation history of the lmc shows pronounced peaks that coincide with the times of possible past close encounters between the lmc , smc and mw , indicative of interaction - triggered cluster formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the lmc , two epochs of cluster formation",
    "have been observed that are separated by an  age gap  of about 4 - 9  gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the early epoch",
    "a well - established population of metal - poor ( @xmath5\\rangle\\sim -2 $ ] ) star clusters with comparable properties to galactic halo clusters @xcite was formed .",
    "these clusters are as old as the oldest globular clusters in the mw and in the galactic dwarf spheroidal companions @xcite . in a second epoch , a large population of intermediate - age clusters with",
    "ages less than 3 - 4  gyr have developed .",
    "in contrast , the smc contains only one old gc , ngc121 , which is 2 - 3  gyr younger than the oldest gc in the lmc and mw @xcite ( paper  i ) .",
    "the second oldest smc star cluster , lindsay1 , has an age of @xmath1  gyr , and since then compact populous star clusters have formed fairly continuously until the present day ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the intermediate - age clusters in the smc might survive for a hubble time , due to their high mass and the structure of the smc ( no bulge or disk to be passed ) @xcite .",
    "the existing age determinations to this point have often been associated with large uncertainties .",
    "stellar crowding , field star contamination and faintness of the main - sequence turnoffs made the measurement of precise ages difficult .",
    "these problems affect in particular ground - based data .",
    "another difficulty is the large depth extent of the smc which exacerbates the distance modulus - reddening degeneracy for each cluster .",
    "these uncertainties can affect the age determination considerably .    the capabilities of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) provide an improvement both in sensitivity ( depth ) as well as angular resolution , which is essential for reliable photometric age determinations in dense clusters .",
    "we present improved cluster ages and distance determinations for lindsay1 , kron3 , ngc416 , ngc339 , lindsay38 , and ngc419 .",
    "this is part of a ground - based and space - based program to uncover the age - metallicity evolution of the smc .",
    "our space - based imaging data were obtained with hst / acs and our ground - based spectroscopy was obtained with _ very large telescope _ ( vlt ) .",
    "we combine our photometric results with spectroscopic metallicity determinations to obtain a well - sampled age - metallicity relation .",
    "the age - metallicity relation determined so far indicated that smc clusters of similar age may differ by several tenths of dex in metallicity @xcite .",
    "previous studies provided ages and metallicities of smc star clusters using a variety of techniques and telescopes ( see @xmath6  [ sec : ana ] ) . combining",
    "all published cluster ages for e.g. kron3 ( 5 - 10  gyr ) @xcite , we find a wide range of ages for some key star clusters depending on the method used for the determination .",

    "figures  [ fig : l1_finaliso ] ,  [ fig : k3_finaliso ] , and  [ fig : ngc416_finaliso ] reflect the general failure of the chosen stellar evolutionary models to simultaneously reproduce all of the major features of cmds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in spite of the excellent fit to the lower rgb , sgb , and ms .",
    "for each cluster we fitted a fiducial ridgeline that provides a unique set of low - metallicity fiducial isochrones , which are invaluable for detailed comparisons with stellar evolution models .    in each of our cluster cmds stars blueward of and above the mstos",
    "are visible , which could be bss .",
    "the radial cumulative distribution of bss candidats in lindsay1 , kron3 , ngc339 , lindsay38 , and ngc419 showed that the stars found in the bss regions are not concentrated toward the cluster centers and are therefore most probably part of the younger ms of the smc field star population . for ngc416 , we find an indication for centrally concentrated bss candidates .",
    "looking at the spatial distribution , we find that the three oldest smc clusters ( ngc121 , lindsay1 , kron3 ) lie in the north - western part of the smc , while the youngest clusters are located near the smc main body .",
    "star clusters with ages higher than @xmath04  gyr are located in the outer parts .    from the observed red clump magnitude",
    "we give a distance estimate for our clusters .",
    "we find that lindsay38 is the most distant cluster in our sample with d@xmath068  kpc , while ngc419 is the closest cluster with d@xmath053  kpc .",
    "therefore , the closest and farthest cluster in our sample have a distance from each other of @xmath017  kpc , which agrees with the assumed large depth extent of the smc .",
    "further , we conclude that the smc experienced massive cluster formation , remnants of which have survived from over much of its lifetime , unlike the lmc or mw .",
    "the oldest and only globular cluster , ngc121 , has formed @xmath011  gyr ago , while the next oldest set of surviving massive clusters , e.g. lindsay1 or ngc361 , date from approximately 3  gyr later . after this time",
    "the largest age gaps are @xmath01  gyr suggesting that massive star clusters occured without any substantial multi - gyr hiatus .",
    "the smc apparently formed massive star clusters that have survived from most of its lifetime .",
