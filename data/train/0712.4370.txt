    "particles are measured before and after the cooling section by two magnetic spectrometers complemented by tof detectors . for each particle",
    "x , y , t , x=dx / dz=@xmath7,y=dy / dz=@xmath8 , t=dt / dz=@xmath9 coordinates are measured . in this way , for an ensemble of n particles , the input and output emittances are measured with high precision ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "conventional multiparticle methods can not be used , due to the correlation between the six particle coordinates , induced by the presence of solenoidal magnetic fields .",
    "the driving design criteria of the mice detector system  @xcite are robustness , in particular of the tracking detectors , to sustain the severe background conditions in the vicinity of rfs and redundancy in pid in order to keep contaminations ( @xmath11 ) below @xmath12 .",
    "precision timing measurements are required to relate the time of a muon to the phase of the rf and simultaneously for particle identification by time - of - flight ( tof ) .",
    "a time resolution around 70 ps ( @xmath13 ) provides both effective ( @xmath14 ) rejection of beam pions and adequate ( @xmath15 ) precision of the rf phase .",
    "particle identification is obtained upstream the first solenoid by two tof stations ( tof0/tof1 ) and a cerenkov counter ( ckv1 ) .",
    "downstream the pid is obtained via a further tof station ( tof2 ) and a calorimeter , to separate muons from decay electrons .",
    "the tof stations share a common design based on fast 1 \" scintillator counters along x / y directions ( to increase measurement redundancy ) read at both edges by r4998 hamamatsu photomultipliers   at b=0 gauss , risetime 0.7 ns , tts @xmath16ps ] . while tof0 planes cover a @xmath17 active area , tof1 and tof2 cover respectively a @xmath18 and @xmath19 active area .",
    "the counter width is 4 cm in tof0 and 6 cm in the following ones .",
    "all downstream detectors and the tof1 station must be shielded against stray magnetic fields ( up to 1000 - 1500 gauss with a @xmath20 gauss longitudinal component , depending on the design of the shielding plates after the spectrometer solenoids ) .",
    "two options for the local tof 1/2 shielding are under study : in one a double - sided shielding cage will contain fully the detector , aside an hole for beam , while in the other individual massive soft iron box pmts shielding are under study @xcite . while the first solution is more elegant and reduce the detector weight , it gives complications for detector access and maintenance .",
    "figure [ fig : pmt ] shows some preliminary results for the shielding of the most dangerous component of the b field , along the pmt axis , obtained with simple mu - metal and mu - metal+a massive iron box shielding .",
    "-1.5 cm         counter prototypes have been tested at the lnf @xmath21 beam test facility ( btf ) with incident electrons of @xmath22 mev to study the intrinsic counter time resolution .",
    "the frontend readout used the baseline mice choice for the tdc : a multihit / multievent caen v1290 tdc , in addition to a caen v792 qadc ( to be replaced in the experiment by caen v1724 fadc ) for time - walk corrections .",
    "the pmt signal was splitted by a passive splitter followed by a leading - edge discriminator before the tdc line .",
    "an intrinsic single counter resolution @xmath23 ps was obtained depending from beam conditions and the design of lightguides or the used scintillator ( bicron bc404 or bc420   nm , @xmath24 cm for bc404 ( bc420 ) ] , amcrys - h ups95f ) . in the same runs , assuming a gaussian fit for the pulse - height distribution it was possible to estimate the number of photoelectrons per single impinging electron ( @xmath25 ) . from @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the peak of the gaussian and @xmath28 its width , an estimate in the range 200 - 300 p.e . for bc420 was obtained , depending on the impact point .",
    "clearly , this estimation neglegts electronic noise and is affected by the bad ( good ) scintillator - pmt coupling .    the tof stations must sustain a high incoming particle rate ( up to 1.5 mhz for tof0 ) .",
    "pmts rate capabilities were tested in laboratory with a dedicated setup @xcite based on a fast laser .",
    "an home - made system based on a nichia ndhv310apc violet laser diode and an avetchpulse fast pulser ( model avo-9a - c laser diode driver , with @xmath29 ps risetime and a avx - s1 output module ) was used .",
    "this system gave laser pulses at @xmath30 nm , with a fwhm between @xmath31 ps and @xmath32 ns ( as measured with a 6ghz 6604b tek scope ) and a max repetition rate of 1 mhz .",
    "a typical r4998 pmt had a good rate capability for signals comparable to an incident @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) up to @xmath35 mhz .",
    "the rate capability was increased by the use of active bases or a booster on the last dynodes for the r4998 pmts , as shown in figure [ fig : pmt ] .",
