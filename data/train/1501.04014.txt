    "<S> we study the effect of final state interactions at the threshold of higgs boson pair production in the glashow - weinberg - salam model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three major processes of the pair production in the model : lepton pair annihilation , zz fusion , and ww fusion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the corrections caused by the effect for these processes are markedly different . </S>",
    "<S> according to our results , the effect can cause non - negligible corrections to the cross sections for lepton pair annihilation and small corrections for zz fusion , and this effect is negligible for ww fusion .    </S>",
    "<S> half a century after the construction of the glashow - weinberg - salam  ( gws )  model of electroweak interactions , the observation of higgs boson at the large hadron collider  ( lhc ) is its latest triumph @xcite . in the future </S>",
    "<S> , further determination of the properties of higgs boson will be extremely important for us to understand the fundamental laws of nature . </S>",
    "<S> any deviation from the predictions in the standard model can give us a valuable clue to the long - hunted new physics . in order to ascertain the role of higgs field in the standard model </S>",
    "<S> , we need to measure its couplings to fermions and gauge bosons . furthermore , to reconstruct the details of the higgs potential </S>",
    "<S> , we have to precisely determine the higgs self - couplings .    at present , an important task of us is to explore potential effects for the higgs self - interactions , and the brout - englert - higgs mechanism must be precisely tested from low to high energies . in this paper , we shall investigate the effect of final state interactions at the threshold of higgs boson pair production in the gws model . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is tied to the low - energy properties of the higgs self - interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs self - interactions can be written in the form @xmath0 for the mass of higgs boson @xmath1 and the vacuum expectation value @xmath2 , @xmath3 .    to establish the non - relativistic potential for the higgs self - interactions , we need to consider the scattering process @xmath4 to leading order in @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> there are four feynman diagrams that contribute , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 1 ] .     </S>",
    "<S> +     note that we can separately discuss the contributions from each diagram , since there is bose statistics involved in the process . in the beginning , let us consider the contributions from the quadrilinear self - coupling of higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 1]a , and its amplitude is @xmath6 according to the definition of born scattering amplitude in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the non - relativistic potential in the momentum spaces is @xmath7 using the fourier transform to @xmath8 , we can get the non - relativistic potential for this term @xmath9 the presence of the delta function comes from the specially local structure in the diagram .    the amplitude for the `` annihilation '' diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 1]b is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the 4-momenta of the incoming higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude in the non - relativistic domain can be approximated as eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ four ] ) , and then we can get a well defined non - relativistic potential . it is not necessary to repeat the same calculations . the non - relativistic potential for the `` annihilation '' diagram is defined as @xmath13    the amplitude for the `` exchange '' diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 1]c is @xmath14 where 4-momentum q is the momentum transfer . in the non - relativistic domain </S>",
    "<S> , the amplitude becomes @xmath15 and the non - relativistic potential in momentum space is @xmath16 after the fourier transform , the non - relativistic potential for the `` exchange '' term is @xmath17    the presence of the `` cross '' term in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ 1]d comes from the indistinguishable property of the identical particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , the `` cross '' term for the scattering of two identical particles does not contribute to the non - relativistic potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is because that the principle of identity also needs to be considered in the scattering theory of non - relativistic quantum mechanics , and then the non - relativistic potential that we get from the elastic scattering of the distinguishable particles will automatically include the contributions from the `` cross '' term of the identical particles . in appendix , we shall show an elementary example in detail .    as a result , we obtain the non - relativistic potential for the higgs self - interactions @xmath18 where coupling constant @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> we know that the probability of scattering is in proportion to the squared modulus of the wave function of the created particles and a non - relativistic potential in the final state can alter the amplitude of the final state wave function in the reaction zone  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that higgs boson can be treated as a stable particle for the higgs self - interactions , since the width of higgs boson is only a few mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the non - relativistic higgs potential in the final state might be able to modify the relevant cross section in perturbation theory , and this effect can be very important for us to understand the low - energy properties of the higgs self - interactions . after getting potential ( [ all ] ) , we shall investigate the effect of final state interactions at the threshold of higgs boson pair production . in recent years a similar effect , which considering the distortion of the incoming wave function of the initial particles , in dark matter was discussed , see . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. ,  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> at first let us consider the final state interactions in the processes of lepton pair annihilation @xmath20 , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pair ] . we know that in perturbation theory the scattering amplitude is defined in the plane wave bases . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we mentioned above , due to the appearance of the interactions in the non - relativistic region of the processes , the wave functions in the reaction zone can be very different from the plane waves . </S>",
    "<S> to consider the corrections in the processes , the universal amplitudes for the @xmath21- , @xmath22- , and @xmath23-channel diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pair ] ) can be written in the forms @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the wave functions for the relative motions of the particles in the initial and final systems , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the plane waves for free motions in the initial and final systems , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the separate distances of the two vertexes in @xmath22- and @xmath23-channel diagrams , and @xmath31 denotes the relevant amplitude in perturbation theory </S>",
    "<S> .    the wave functions introduced in universal amplitudes ( [ uni1]-[uni3 ] ) can give the corrections to the squared modulus of the plane waves in the reaction zone , and we can solve the schrdinger equations to get the wave functions if we know the forces between the particles in the initial and final states . notice that in the perturbation region the universal amplitudes become the same as the amplitudes in perturbation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> in the process of the electron - positron annihilation , it is straightforward to see that the contributions of @xmath22- and @xmath23-channel diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pair ] ) can be ignored , since the yukawa coupling to electron ( @xmath32 ) is very weaker than the higgs self - couplings . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in practical applications , the squared modulus of the amplitude at the threshold can be simplified as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the correction term caused by the final state interactions in the process .    </S>",
    "<S> note that to find the corrections caused by the effect of final state interactions , we only need to consider the corrections to the s - wave , because the higgs boson pair is emitted in an s - wave at the threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced two - body radical schrodinger equation with a potential @xmath35 is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the s - wave radical function . </S>",
    "<S> the radical wave function @xmath39 can be normalized as @xmath40 , and notice that @xmath39 is real in this convention . since we have already obtained non - relativistic potential  ( [ all ] ) , to find @xmath34 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ep ] ) , we can numerically solve the schrdinger equation with boundary conditions @xmath41 as @xmath42 and @xmath43 as @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we should note here that although the non - relativistic potential for the higgs self - interactions is composed of different terms , only the `` exchange '' term would be involved in the effect . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the final state interactions between two separate particles come from the exchange of their force carriers , thus only the `` exchange '' part of the non - relativistic potential need be considering . </S>",
    "<S> the numeric simulations for the 125.5 gev higgs boson are presented in tab .  </S>",
    "<S> [ electron ] . we find that at the threshold the two - higgs - boson final state interactions can increase the cross section by near ten percent .    </S>",
    "<S> .the numeric simulations for the corrections in electron - positron annihilation process , where @xmath45 is the center of mass energy . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ww - fusion ]    in summary , we have calculated the effect of final state interactions in three major processes of higgs boson pair production for the first time , and we find that the corrections caused by the effect for these processes are markedly different . </S>",
    "<S> this paper could be useful for understanding and precisely determining the higgs self - interactions at low energies .    </S>",
