    "carbon based nanostructures , especially , quasi-1d structures like carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) and , recently , graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) , are playing more and more important role in the development of nanoelectronics @xcite , possibly leading to an era of carbon - based electronics .",
    "the practical application of cnts is , however , limited by the challenge in controlling experimentally their diameter and chirality which control whether they are metallic or semiconducting .",
    "different from cnts , the electronic properties of gnrs are determined by their edge geometry and width and have shown promise for future generation of transistor @xcite .",
    "zigzag - edged gnrs ( zgnrs ) are particularly intriguing because of their spin - polarized edge states which are localized around the two edges .",
    "the resulting spin - dependent transport may make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics . in narrow zgnrs with @xmath2 zigzag carbon chains ( denoted by @xmath2-zgnrs , @xmath2 @xmath3 ) the anti - parallel spin configuration is the ground state , which is slightly more favorable in energy than the parallel - spin one , while in wider @xmath2-zgnrs ( @xmath2 @xmath4 ) the two spin configurations are both possible to exist due to the negligible interaction between the two edge states @xcite . even in narrow zgnrs ,",
    "the small energy difference makes it possible to change the ground state from anti - parallel spins to parallel spins by appling a magnetic or electric field @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting progress related to graphene is the successful fabrication of free - standing linear carbon atomic chains carved out from a graphene sheet by high - energy electron beam @xcite , which is found stable and is connected by @xmath5 bonding . unlike cnts and gnrs , a carbon atomic chain has no chirality and width .",
    "therefore , it provides an ideal transport channel for molecular devices .",
    "experimentally , a carbon chain made in this way can be used as an on - chip device with the advantage of the perfect @xmath5 connection to the leads already set .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the situation in conventional molecular electronics using metal electrodes where a well - defined molecule - lead contact with a good reproducebility is a big challenge @xcite . for the miniatrization of the whole device",
    ", the two graphene leads can be cut to form gnrs . theoretically , the device structure of a carbon chain connecting two zgnr leads is particularly interesting since it combines the simple transport channel with the rich electronic properties of zgnrs via the perfect @xmath5 contact .",
    "its transport properties can be artificially tailored to realize different functionalities , as shown in this work .",
    "first , the tunable spin state of the leads can be used to control the density of states at the fermi energy , giving either a large or zero equilibrium conductance ( switch ) .",
    "second , the atomic thin bridge can be used to explore the locally spin - polarized edge states , implying that the transport behavior will be sensitive to the position of the bridge .",
    "this may be used to realize selectively the functionality of either on - chip interconnects or spintronics .",
    "so far , the conductance of carbon chains connected to different types of electrodes have recently been studied by several research groups @xcite but how it behaves is still an open problem depending on the nature of the electrode used . among these work ,",
    "a calculation @xcite of spin - denpendent transport was reported for a junction with very narrow zgnr leads connected via a spin - polarized 5-member ring which is , however , unlikely to be carved out directly from a graphene sheet and is probably unstable due to the unpaired @xmath6 electron without doping @xcite .",
    "recently shen _ et al _ reported a theoretical calculation for carbon chain - zgnr junctions with very narrow zgnr leads but ignoring totally the spin freedom @xcite .",
    "an interesting finding from their calculation is that the equilibrium conductance shows an even - odd oscillation with regard to the number of atoms in the carbon chain @xcite : a chain with an odd number of atoms will have a larger conductance than one with an even number of atoms .",
    "this even - odd behavior is due to the very sharp peak in the transmission function at the fermi energy , whose origination was not understood clearly and was ascribed to the edge states of the leads .",
    "however , if one takes the spin freedom into account , this even - odd behavior will totally disappear for the ground state since the anti - parallel spins will create a band gap in the leads .",
    "another recent work about transport properties of carbon chain - gnr junctions was reported by zanolli _",
    "et al_@xcite , in which the spin freedom was taken into account . in their calculation wider gnr leads are considered and a carbon chain is connected right in the middle of the gap .",
    "it was found that the spin freedom has a significant effect .",
    "especially , an odd - numbered carbon chain bridge is found to be spin - polarized by itself while an even - numbered one is not .",
    "this calculation showed that an odd - numbered carbon chain combined with parallel - spin leads can give a large spin - polarized equilibrium conductance due to the peaks in the transmission function around the fermi energy .",
    "this result implys that these peaks are not associated with the edge states because the bridge is in the middle and far away from the edges though their origination was unclear .    despite these previous studies , a full understanding about the transport properties of carbon chain - zgnr junctions is still lacking , especailly the effect from the bridge position and its combination with the spin configuration and width of the leads , as well as the underlying physics leading to the transport behavior . in this work",
    ", we investigate the spin - dependent electron transport of carbon chain - zgnr junctions by performing first - principles calculations based on the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) approach combined with the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "we study systematically the effects from all the factors mentioned above .",
    "our calculation shows that the bridge position combined with the spin freedom of the leads dominates the transport behavior .",
    "the uderlying physics leading to this transport behavior is fully analyzed by investigating the space - resolved density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the present work indicates that different functionalities can be achieved by changing the bridge position and the spin state of the leads : on - chip interconnects can be realized with a bridge connected in the middle and a parallel spin configuration of the leads , which give a large equilibrium conductance , while a device for spintronics may be realized with a bridge connected at the edge , which gives a very high spin - polarization ratio .",

    "the coupling of this finite dos to the electronic states in the carbon chain gives rise to the sharp resonance peaks around the fermi energy ( see futher discussion later ) .",

    "[ fig_t(e)-4 ] ( d ) and [ fig_t(e)-6 ] ( f ) ) .",
    "being consistent with the previous calculation adopting wider zgnr leads @xcite , our calculation shows that the c@xmath7 chain is spin - polarized by itself @xcite .",
    "this leads to the spin - polarized transport even when the carbon chain is connected in the right middle ( i.e. , m2-bridge , see fig.[fig_t(e)-6 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "however , the present calculation further shows that the resulting spin - polarized transport is significantly modulated by the bridge position . for example , in the case of ( @xmath9 , @xmath9 ) the splitting between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-spin peaks and also the spin polarization ratio around the fermi energy varies largely with the bridge position ( see fig.[fig_t(e)-6 ] ( b ) vs ( d ) ) due to the interaction with the edge states ( see further discussion later ) . as for the effect from the width of the lead",
    ", one can see that for the same m1-bridge connection the overall effect in the transmission function is not significant and does not change the qualitative result when the width of the leads is increased from 4 to 6 zigzag chains : fig .  [ fig_t(e)-4 ] ( a ) vs fig .",

    "[ fig_bands ] ( c ) , while a finite dos still exists for ( @xmath0 , @xmath0 ) due to the band crossing shown in fig .",

    "it can be seen that in both cases the ldos spreads out through the whole junction and distributes quite evenly in the leads , indicating that it is associated with the bulk states . in the case of ( @xmath0 , @xmath0 ) the finite dos around the fermi energy couples with the spin - polarized states in the bridge (",

    "[ fig_ldosb ] ( a ) and ( b ) for the m2- and m1-bridge connections , respectively .",
    "one can see that when the bridge is positioned in the right middle ( m2-bridge ) the ldos has large contribution from the bridge region and is distributed evenly throughout the leads , indicating that it is a result of the coupling between the states in the bridge and the bulk states in the leads . when the bridge is closer to the edge ( m1-bridge ) now the ldos has also large contribution from the edge states within the scattering region , indicating an interaction between the spin - polarized bridge states and the edge states , which modulates the spin - polarized transport behavior of the junction around the fermi energy ( see fig.[fig_t(e)-6 ] ( b ) vs ( d ) ) .    on the other hand , for the zigzag chain of the edge ( figs .",
    "[ fig_pdos ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) the pdos reflects essentially the edge state which has two sharp peaks beside the fermi energy , i.e. , the occupied @xmath0-spin and unoccupied @xmath1-spin states , respectively , placing a near - zero dos elsewhere .",
    "consequently , when the bridge is positioned at the edge it mainly couples with these edge states , leading to the transmission function with only very sharp peaks corresponding to the edge states , as shown in figs .",

    "[ fig_ldosb ] ( c ) shows that the transport is indeed along the two edges . in this case , even for the ( @xmath9 , @xmath9 ) spin configuration the transport around the fermi energy is also nearly blocked . note that unlike the transport gap created by the anti - parallel spins in ( @xmath8 , @xmath8 ) case , this transport gap between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-spin conponents actually increases from the 4-zgnr to the 6-zgnr junction ( 0.26 and",
    "0.33ev , respectively ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath11 spin interaction in the narrow 4-zgnr lead induces extra dispersions of the edge states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_bands ] ( b ) vs ( d ) .",
    "the broad and very narrow peaks in the transmission function reflect the overall coupling strength between the carbon chain and the zgnr leads .",
    "it is interesting to note that the best coupling is given by neither the bridge at the edge ( e - bridge ) nor the bridge right in the middle ( m2-bridge ) but the one positioned in between ( m1-bridge ) .",
    "this is evident in the ldos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ldos - a ] where the m1-bridge gives a remarkably larger ldos around the bridge and contact region than the m2-bridge does .",

    "according to the present calculation , however , the spin freedom must be taken into account in reaching this conclusion . to have a direct comparison",

[ fig_t(e)-4 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "additionally , for the e - bridge connection even in the case of ( @xmath9 , @xmath9 ) the equilibrium conductance is also nearly zero because of the large splitting between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-spin components ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_t(e)-4 ] ( d ) ) . for the wider ( 6-zgnr)-c@xmath7-(6-zgnr ) junction ,",

    "the present spin - polarized calcuation shows that , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig_ldosb ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the large resonance peaks at the fermi energy is not originated from the edge states , but comes from the coupling between the finite dos in the leads due to the band crossing and the states in the bridge whose pdos is given in figs .",
