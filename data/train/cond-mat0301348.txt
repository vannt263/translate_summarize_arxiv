    "]    the model defines dynamical rules for the reptons motion .",
    "the dynamics on a smaller scale , i.e. high frequency rouse modes , is averaged out . in this sense",
    ", the rd model is an effective model .",
    "the dynamical rules for the reptons are :    * each cell occupied by the chain must contain at least one repton to ensure connectivity of the chain , since the length represented by a repton equals the lattice constant of the cells .",
    "the sequence of occupied pores corresponds to the tube as in standard reptation theory . *",
    "end reptons can move to adjacent cells provided rule a ) is not violated . *",
    "interior reptons can move to cells occupied by the neighboring reptons if allowed by rule a ) .",
    "this ensures the dynamics to be reptation , as any movements in the interior requires multiple reptons to occupy the same cell , which means that there is some excess stored length available .",
    "this corresponds to the motion of defects in the original de gennes reptation model .",
    "all moves are assumed to be thermally activated . in our model the cubic lattice representing the entanglement network gets kinematically disordered by assigning an individual energy barrier to every boundary between adjacent cells .",
    "these barriers have to be overcome by a crossing repton .",
    "note that we do not assign different energies to the reptons when residing in the cells .",
    "this choice of quenched disorder guarantees that only the mobility of the reptons , but not the equilibrium configurations are affected , as will be seen below .",
    "let there be @xmath14 different possible hopping rates @xmath15 , which are distributed randomly and occur with a probability @xmath16 throughout the lattice .",
    "we demand that the disorder averages @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the mean hopping time and its second moment ) are finite .",
    "the rd model is used to describe the dynamics of an entangled polymer chain under the influence of an external electric field .",
    "a common example is dna under electrophoresis conditions where the reptons carry a charge each and develop a drift velocity along the direction of an applied electric field .",
    "let the field be oriented along the @xmath19 diagonal of the cubes .",
    "we denote the ( dimensionless ) energy gain of a repton when moving from one cell to another along the direction of the field as @xmath20 . by local detailed balance ,",
    "moves across a cell boundary with assigned hopping rate @xmath15 along the field happen with rate @xmath21 , those in the opposite direction with rate @xmath22 @xcite . by projecting the reptons positions on the direction of the field",
    ", their relative coordinates can be denoted as a 1-d lattice gas with @xmath1 sites by the following prescription :    * if the projected link between adjacent reptons @xmath23 and @xmath24 is oriented along ( against ) the field direction across a cell boundary with assigned rate @xmath15 , site @xmath23 of the lattice gas is assigned the value @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we interpret values @xmath27 as particles . *",
    "if adjacent reptons @xmath23 and @xmath24 occupy the same cell , i.e. , their projected positions coincide , the link is represented in the lattice gas as @xmath28 at site @xmath23 .",
    "we interpret a site , which is assigned a 0 as being unoccupied .",
    "thus the @xmath13 coordinates of the reptons in direction of the field are translated into the equivalent set of the relative coordinates manifest as the assignment of @xmath29 or 0 to the @xmath1 sites of the lattice gas plus the center of mass coordinate s component in field direction .",
    "the dynamics of the reptons translates into the lattice gas picture as follows : in the bulk particles of sort @xmath30 hop to the left with rate @xmath31 and to the right with rate @xmath32 , where each site can be occupied by at most one particle .",
    "the end dynamics in the lattice gas picture needs some care : assuming @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) to be non zero , the only possible move is the retraction of the end repton to the cell occupied by it s neighbor ( rule a ) ) .",
    "this retraction , being a particle annihilation event in the lattice gas picture , happens with the same rate as the respective move in the bulk . assuming @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) to be zero , the end repton can , according to rule b ) , move to any of the @xmath35 adjacent cells . for half of these",
    "the move leads to links being along the field direction , the other half against it .",
    "the probability of the chosen move leading to the crossing of a cell boundary with rate @xmath15 being assigned to it is @xmath16 .",
    "thus the move of the repton , being a particle creation event in the lattice gas picture leads to @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) changing from 0 to @xmath30 with rate @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "this choice of boundary dynamics is on average correct , but neglects the actual local structure of the network . in order to verify that the model is correct on long time scales ( as relevant for the cms diffusion ) we performed monte carlo simulations comparing the diffusion constant of our projected model with @xmath38 at different disorder distributions with a polymer chain moving according to the dynamics of the repton model in a two dimensional lattice with random but fixed hopping rates assigned to each cell boundary .",
    "it turns out that although the results differ for small chains ( @xmath39 ) they coincide within the statistical errors for longer chains .",
    "this legitimates our choice of boundary dynamics for investigating the behavior of long chains .",
    "figure [ disorder ] shows an example where a disorder distribution with @xmath40 was chosen .",
    "+        every move of a particle in the lattice gas leads to a change in the component of the center of mass coordinate of the repton chain along the field direction .",
    "* particle type @xmath41 moving to the right ( left ) decreases ( increases ) @xmath42 by @xmath43 , as this is equivalent to a repton moving downward ( upward ) .",

    "particle type @xmath44 moving to the right ( left ) increases ( decreases ) @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "in the subsequent chapters we will calculate the drift velocity @xmath45 of the center of mass coordinate in presence of an applied electric field and by employing the einstein relation the zero field diffusion constant . when calculating @xmath45 we restrict ourselves to the linear response regime , ignoring higher order field dependences . in order to calculate @xmath45",
    "only the change in the center of mass coordinate along the field @xmath42 has to be known , but not the absolute value itself .",
    "whereas the latter can not be known from the lattice gas , the former is given by the difference of the currents of positive particles @xmath46 and that of the negative ones @xmath47 : @xmath48 . as the choice of the field direction is arbitrary , by use of the einstein relation the model allows for computing the zero field diffusion constant along a distinct direction in @xmath8-dimensional space . as zero field diffusion",
    "is isotropic this immediately yields the @xmath8-dimensional diffusion constant .",
    "this is due to distinguishing between particles of types @xmath41 and @xmath49 in contrast to the original projected repton model used by rubinstein , which allows only for the computation of the curvilinear diffusion constant along the contour of the chain . in the rubinstein model",
    "additional assumptions are necessary to relate the curvilinear to the @xmath8-dimensional diffusion constant . our model as well as the rd model allows for computation of the latter quantity within the model .",
    "the model introduced in the previous chapter describes a markov process and thus the dynamics can be written in form of a master equation . for convenience we will use the quantum hamiltonian formalism @xcite to write down the master equation at zero electric field and solve for the stationary state .",
    "+ at each site of the lattice gas with length @xmath1 , @xmath50 values for @xmath51 are possible .",
    "therefore , the state space @xmath52 has the dimension @xmath53 .",
    "every @xmath54 is assigned a vector @xmath55 and a transposed vector @xmath56 .",
    "these vectors constitute a basis for the space of system configurations @xmath52 .",
    "a probability distribution @xmath57 can thus be written as a probability vector :    @xmath58    let a summation vector @xmath59 be defined as @xmath60 .",
    "normalization of the probability vector is given if @xmath61 .",
    "the generator for the dynamics of the system is the matrix @xmath62 : the off - diagonal elements of the matrix contain the ( negative ) transition rates @xmath63 from a state @xmath64 to @xmath65 :    @xmath66    the diagonal elements @xmath67 contain the sum of all outgoing rates :    @xmath68    it is easily checked that conservation of probability , i.e. @xmath69 in the language of the quantum hamiltonian formalism , is fulfilled by @xmath62 .",
    "the master equation    @xmath70    describing the markovian dynamics of the system can be written as :    @xmath71    the stationary state @xmath72 is thus characterized by the equation    @xmath73    in this formalism the expectation value @xmath74 of an operator @xmath75 is written as follows @xcite : the operator @xmath76 is represented by a diagonal matrix @xmath77 .",

    "this means we have to consider the overall probability for particles of positive sign at a site , which is @xmath107 , or negative sign , being also @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "these are equal to the probabilities found for the disorder free rd - model @xcite which shows that the chosen kind of disorder is indeed kinematic disorder , as it influences only the mobility but not the equilibrium configurations of the chain .",
    "+ note that it is not possible to compute the stationary state for the model with a non - zero field at arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "therefore the einstein relation @xmath109 is not a feasible way of straightforwardly computing the diffusion constant .",
    "extra input is needed to overcome this problem .",
