    "understanding star formation mechanisms within galaxies is one of the most fundamental issues regarding the evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is known that the majority of stars form in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , which have masses of about @xmath2@xmath3 and sizes of about 10100 pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , vary for different galactic structures such as spirals , inter - arms , and bars . accordingly , understanding the formation and evolution of gmcs , as well as the relationships between these processes and galactic structures , is a key factor in building a complete picture of star formation in galaxies . in this paper ,",
    "the first of this series , we focus on the formation , evolution , and dynamical state of gmcs in spiral arms .    according to the traditional view of gmc evolution in spiral arm environments ,",
    "gmc evolution is influenced by ` galactic shock ' @xcite owing to so - called ` quasi - stationary density waves ' @xcite : if gas flows _ across _ a spiral arm , it experiences a sudden compression due to the galactic shock and is followed by cloud formation in a phase transition @xcite , shock compression of incoming clouds @xcite , and gravitational collapse @xcite , which triggers star formation .",
    "this scenario predicts that gmcs have evolutionary sequences across spiral arms in a wide radial range , which has been preferred by recent observations of gmcs in nearby spiral galaxies such as m51 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ic 342 @xcite .",
    "several galactic - scale hydrodynamic simulations have been performed to investigate the dynamical response of the ism to a _ rigidly rotating _",
    "spiral potential , which models quasi - stationary density waves .",
    "such hydrodynamic simulations have highlighted the roles of spiral arms in the formation and evolution of gmcs ; the spiral potentials would enhance cloud ",
    "cloud collisions , which occur every 810 myr , and result in the formation of massive gmcs up to @xmath4@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that these gmcs are predominantly gravitationally unbound objects , because cloud - cloud collisions and stellar feedback generate internal random motions of the gas .",
    "in addition to gmc formation , hydrodynamic simulations in spiral potentials showed that when a gmc passes through a spiral arm , strong shear within the spiral arm contributes to the destruction of the gmc @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite suggested that smaller @xmath5 ) clouds are strongly affected by feedback , whereas larger ( @xmath6 ) clouds are more affected by shear .",
    "in contrast to the traditional quasi - stationary density wave theory , wherein stellar spiral arms slowly change during several galactic rotation periods ( i.e. @xmath7 gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an alternative spiral theory has been developed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "this so - called ` dynamic ' spiral theory predicts that stellar spiral arms are dynamic structures , with amplitudes that change on the galactic rotation time scale , or even more rapidly ( i.e. a few hundred million years ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dynamic spirals are also observed in @xmath0-body barred spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "in contrast to quasi - stationary density waves , such dynamic spirals _ co - rotate _ with material at any given radius @xcite . this co - rotational behaviour may occur because the swing amplification is most efficient near the co - rotation radius ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and non - linear interactions between the swing - amplified wakelets develop a global spiral arm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite performed hydrodynamic simulations of dynamic multiple spirals and found that the gas effectively falls into the spiral potential minimum from _ both sides _ of the spiral arm ( the so - called ` large - scale colliding flows ' ) , rather than passing through the spiral arms , as predicted by galactic shock theory .",
    "@xcite observed such large - scale colliding flow in a simulated barred galaxy with a dynamic grand - design spiral .",
    "this recent progress related to the dynamics of spiral arms suggests that a rigidly rotating spiral could not be a reasonable dynamical model for investigating the formation and evolution of gmcs .",
    "it is therefore necessary to investigate the differences between these processes in quasi - stationary density waves and dynamic spirals . @xcite and @xcite investigated gmcs by using @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulations with sub - parsec - scale or parsec - scale resolutions , although they did not focus on the relationship between gmcs and spiral arms .",
    "thus , the formation and evolution of gmcs , as well as the relationship between gmcs and spiral arms , have not yet been well explored in a dynamic spiral context .    in this study",
    ", we performed a three - dimensional @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulation of a barred spiral galaxy at a parsec - scale resolution in order to investigate the structures , formation and evolution of gmcs in a galactic context .",
    "our galaxy model has _ dynamic _ barred grand - design spirals , which develop spontaneously from an axisymmetric bulge - disk - halo system @xcite . to study the effects of the dynamical behaviours of spiral arms",
    ", we also performed a hydrodynamic simulation of a _",
    "fixed _ spiral potential with a single pattern speed , which mimics the traditional spiral model .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] , we describe our simulation methods regarding self - gravity , radiative cooling , heating due to interstellar radiation , molecular hydrogen formation , star formation from cold dense gas , and stellar feedback from @xmath8 regions / supernova ( sn ) explosions . we describe the differences between the molecular gas structures and gmcs around the two types of spiral arms in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "we then present the results regarding the formation , evolution , and dynamical state of gmcs in the dynamic spirals in section [ sec : dynamicspiralresults ] .",
    "in particular , we focus on one simulated gmc in the spiral region and describe its evolution in detail and then present the statistical dynamical properties of gmcs , as well as the effects of galactic tides and external pressures . the formation and evolution of gmcs in the fixed spiral model are presented in section [ sec : fixedspiralresults ] .",
    "finally , we summarize the results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we used our original @xmath0-body / smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code asura-2 @xcite to perform three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "asura-2 implements a time - step limiter that allows us to solve rapid expansions by imposing sufficiently small time - step differences between neighbouring particles @xcite .",
    "the fast method , which accelerates the time integration of a self - gravitating fluid through the assignment of different time steps for gravity and the hydrodynamic interactions of each particle , was also implemented @xcite .",
    "the self - gravities of the stellar and sph particles were computed using the tree with the grape method @xcite .       for the parameters of ssp approximation . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the radiative cooling of the gas was determined by assuming an optically thin cooling function , @xmath9 , based on a radiative transfer model of photo - dissociation regions for a wide temperature range of @xmath10 ( see appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "in this cooling function , the molecular hydrogen fraction , @xmath11 , follows the fitting formula given by @xcite , and @xmath12 is the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) intensity normalized to the solar neighbourhood value .",
    "we also included the photoelectric heating of the gas due to interstellar fuv radiation @xcite .",
    "the heating rate was calculated using : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fraction of fuv radiation absorbed by grains , which is converted to gas heating ( i.e. heating efficiency ) .",
    "note that @xmath15 depends on the value of @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the number density of electrons ; see fig",

    "* ) and decreases by a factor of 10 for @xmath18 .",
    "although the high-@xmath16 situation corresponds to environments with high @xmath12 , high @xmath19 , or low density , sn heating or @xmath1-region heating is predominant in these environments .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we used @xmath20 for gas with @xmath21 k and @xmath22 for @xmath23 k which is the typical range for a neutral gas .    in the present study , we adopted different methods of evaluating @xmath12 depending on whether or not an sph particle was heated by stellar feedback ( sne or @xmath8-regions ) .",
    "for the sph particles heated by stellar feedback , we used @xmath24 in order to force the sph particles to have @xmath25 . for the non - heated sph particles , we calculated @xmath12 using the following equation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total column density of hydrogen , @xmath28 is the effective cross - section for dust extinction at @xmath29 @xcite , and @xmath30 is a normalized fuv intensity in optically thin limit . in this study , @xmath27 was estimated by using a sobolev - like approximation @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the number density of hydrogen and the mass density of an sph particle , respectively , and the evaluation of @xmath34 is based on the standard sph formulation .",
    "in contrast , @xmath30 is given by a summation over all stellar particles @xcite : @xmath35 where the numerical value of @xmath36 is the observed fuv intensity in the solar neighbourhood @xcite , and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the mass , time - dependent specific fuv luminosity , and distance of the @xmath40-th stellar particle , respectively .",
    "the tree method was used to compute this summation .",
    "we determined @xmath38 of the @xmath40-th stellar particle by following its age by using the stellar population synthesis modelling software pegase @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fuvluminosityssp]a shows the time evolution of @xmath38 .",
    "we implemented a sub - grid model for star formation into our simulation as follows .",
    "each stellar particle was considered to be a simple stellar population ( ssp ) having its own age , metallicity and initial mass function ( imf ) . throughout this study",
    ", we assumed that the imf was the salpeter type @xcite , which has lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 @xmath41 and 100 @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "if an sph particle satisfied the criteria ( 1 ) @xmath42 ; ( 2 ) @xmath43 ; and ( 3 ) @xmath44 , it created star particles in a probabilistic manner following the schmidt law with a local dimensionless star formation efficiency , @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the global star formation properties , such as the star formation rate and schmidt  kennicutt relation ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , are insensitive to the adopted value of @xmath46 and are instead primarily controlled by the global evolution of the ism from reservoir to dense gas , where stars are formed @xcite .",
    "we also note that @xcite adopted a density criterion of @xmath47 in hydrodynamic simulations at a mass resolution level similar to that considered in the present investigation .",
    "type - ii sn feedback was included in the thermal energy , and the times at which the sn events occurred were determined probabilistically , as in @xcite . in our probabilistic treatment ,",
    "all of the sn events in a stellar particle were assumed to occur simultaneously , as a single event . assuming that stars with masses larger than @xmath48 exploded as type - ii sn , the probability of a stellar particle undergoing an sn explosion during a time - step @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the age of a stellar particle , @xmath52 is the type - ii sn rate for the stellar particle , and @xmath53 is the lifetime of an @xmath48 star ( i.e. @xmath54 myr ) .",

    "we incorporated the @xmath1-region feedback as pre - sn feedback using a stromgren volume approach , in which the gas around young stars that extend out to a radius sufficiently large for ionization balance is simply set to a temperature of @xmath59 k ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , the gaseous arms are located upstream from the spiral arms at @xmath218 -20 myr , on the spiral arms at @xmath140 myr , and downstream from the spiral arms at @xmath218 4 myr .",
    "such oscillating or stochastic behaviours drive the complicated flows within spiral arms and result in the destruction of the evolutionary sequences of gmcs across spiral arms , which would be expected simply based on the traditional spiral model .",

    "investigations of whether gmcs show evolutionary sequences across spiral arms in _ a wide radial range _ will be a possible means of discriminating the origins of spiral arms .",
    "these studies will require high spatial resolution and wide - field mapping of molecular gas in spiral galaxies with equipment such as the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "2 .   the simulated gmcs were highly dynamic and exhibited eventful lives involving collisional build - up , collision - induced star formation , and destruction via stellar feedback before all of the gas within the gmcs were transformed into stars .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the collisional build - up was driven by large - scale colliding flows associated with the spiral arm formation @xcite , as well as by nearby sn explosions .",
    "although the simulated gmcs were observed to be _ collapsing _ rather than in virial equilibrium , they followed the observed scaling relationships well .",
    "thus , our results support the dynamic picture of gmcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rather than the traditional equilibrium picture ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the global collapse of molecular clouds is supported by recent observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "4 .   the scaling relationships of the gmcs did not originate from the equilibrium state ; instead , these could be explained by considering the collapsing state .",
    "furthermore , this finding implies that a virial parameter is not a good indicator of the equilibrium state of a gmc @xcite .",
    "in contrast , through hydrodynamic simulations , @xcite demonstrated that gmcs are predominantly gravitationally unbound objects , although their arguments were based on the virial parameter .",
    "in fact , even if gmcs have @xmath220 , the gmcs would indicate @xmath221 , suggesting that the gmcs are collapsing .",
    "the effects of galactic tides and external pressure on the self - gravitational energy of the simulated gmcs were found to be non - negligible .",
    "this result suggests that both galactic tides ( in particular , the components toward the galactic plane ) and external pressure contributes to gmc collapse .",
    "thus , our model suggests that a part of star formation activity in spiral arms is induced through the combined effects of increased rates of cloud - cloud collisions and compressions by sn explosions .    according to our numerical resolutions and feedback models ,",
    "gmcs are likely destroyed by stellar feedback ( in particular , @xmath8-region feedback ) .",
    "nevertheless , some previous studies suggested that @xmath8-region feedback only weekly affects gmc destruction .",

    "they argued that @xmath8-region heating is not expected to destroy clumps but is likely to modify their inner structures and the ongoing star formation .",
    "more recently , @xcite applied the post - process calculation of radiative transfer to a time series of sph simulations of a spiral galaxy , and then suggested that the @xmath8-region feedback may play only a minor role in the regulation of star formation .",
    "one possible reason for the discrepancy between the results of our study and those of the previous studies is the different numerical resolutions .",
    "if the stellar feedback is input into the neighbouring particles or cells , the use of a coarse resolutions could cause a large amount of gas to be affected .",
    "however , local - scale hydrodynamic simulations of individual gmcs , which were based on a simple ray - tracing algorithm and a stromgren volume technique , showed that gmcs with masses up to @xmath160 could be readily destroyed by the @xmath8-region feedback @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effect of stellar feedback could depend on the numerical resolutions , hydrodynamic schemes ( amr or sph ) , and how the @xmath8-region feedback is introduced into the simulations ( see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein ) . to reach a conclusion , a more sophisticated treatment of stellar feedback within a gmc , as well as higher resolutions ,",

    "thus , to understand formation and evolution of gmcs , as well as star formation in galaxies , more sophisticated treatment of stellar feedback within gmcs should be coupled with galactic - scale simulations . to explore the dynamical interactions between the ism and time - dependent stellar structures such as spiral arms and bars , along with their environmental dependence , we will present detailed studies of these subjects using self - consistent simulations ( with parsec - scale resolution ) of barred spiral galaxies in forthcoming papers ( baba et al . in preparation ) .",

    "<S> the formation and evolution of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in spiral galaxies have been investigated in the traditional framework of the combined quasi - stationary density wave and galactic shock model . in this study , we investigate the structure and evolution of gmcs in a dynamically evolving spiral arm using a three - dimensional @xmath0-body / hydrodynamic simulation of a barred spiral galaxy at parsec - scale resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this simulation incorporated self - gravity , molecular hydrogen formation , radiative cooling , heating due to interstellar far - ultraviolet radiation , and stellar feedback by both @xmath1 regions and type - ii supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to a simple expectation based on the traditional spiral model , the gmcs exhibited no systematic evolutionary sequence across the spiral arm . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation showed that the gmcs behaved as highly dynamic objects with eventful lives involving collisional build - up , collision - induced star formation , and destruction via stellar feedback . </S>",
    "<S> the gmc lifetimes were predicted to be short , only a few tens of millions years . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that , at least at the resolutions and with the feedback models used in this study , most of the gmcs without @xmath1 regions were collapsing , but half of the gmcs with @xmath1 regions were expanding owing to the @xmath1-region feedback from stars within them . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the dynamic and feedback - regulated gmc evolution scenario . </S>",
    "<S> although the simulated gmcs were converging rather than virial equilibrium , they followed the observed scaling relationship well . </S>",
    "<S> we also analysed the effects of galactic tides and external pressure on gmc evolution and suggested that gmcs can not be regarded as isolated systems since their evolution in disc galaxies is complicated because of these environmental effects .    </S>",
