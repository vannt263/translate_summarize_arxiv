    "studies of the molecular medium in distant galaxies provide key diagnostics about the evolutionary state of galaxies in the high  redshift universe . to date ,",
    "@xmath14200 high  redshift galaxies have been detected in co emission , the main tracer for molecular gas ( e.g. , review by * ? ? ?",
    "essentially all these detections were obtained by targeted observations of galaxies that had been pre  selected through their star forming properties ( e.g. uv or fir emission ) .",
    "advances in millimeter technology now allow spectral - line scans across full atmospheric windows .",
    "scans over a broad frequency range now allow meaningful attempts at redshift determinations in heavily - obscured , high-@xmath13 galaxies , through the detection of molecular gas tracers . in turn , they enable studies of the molecular gas emission over large cosmic volumes .",
    "such studies have been out of reach until very recently , because of limitations both in sensitivity and instantaneous frequency coverage of existing millimeter facilities .",
    "here we present the first blind molecular line scan of an optical deep field , i.e. a region in the sky for which superb multi  wavelength data is available .",
    "our target of choice is a region in the hubble deep field north ( hdf  n , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of the best studied optical / nir deep fields .",
    "we have used the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) to scan the 3 mm atmospheric band , to search for co transitions .",
    "this band is particularly well suited for co surveys of high-@xmath13 galaxies , as it targets the lowest  j co transitions , which are collisionally excited by h@xmath15 at low temperatures . as shown in fig .",

    "this search allowed us to unambiguously establish the redshift of this luminous galaxy ( @xmath7 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a similar ` blind line search ' approach was presented in @xcite , who performed a scan of the 3 mm window with alma to obtain redshifts for 26 strongly  lensed sub - mm galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "this search resulted in the discovery of 44 lines , and in the identification of 20 unambiguous redshifts .",
    "the alma observations presented in @xcite have a typical rms noise level of 2 mjybeam@xmath10 per 50 - 60 channel , i.e. , a 4-@xmath8 line luminosity limit of @xmath20 ( assuming a line width of 300 ) .",
    "this depth is insufficient to probe any co emission arising from main sequence galaxies in the targeted fields .    , @xmath21 , and at any @xmath22 , as highlighted by the shaded area .",

    "we have obtained the first frequency scan of the 3 mm window ( 79.7114.8ghz ) in the hubble deep field north ( hdf  n ) using the plateau de bure interferometer .",
    "this molecular line scan constitutes the first blind survey of co emission in ` normal ' galaxies ( i.e. , non  smgs ) at high @xmath13 .",
    "our main observational results can be summarized as follows :    * we achieved approximately uniform sensitivity ( @xmath25 mjybeam@xmath10 per 90 channel ) over the entire scan , which allows us to probe the co line luminosities down to @xmath26 at any @xmath3 . * using different search algorithms we have identified 17 positive line candidates ( and 4 negative ones ) .",
    "typical fluxes are in the range 0.160.56 , while line widths are between 110 and 500 .",
    "we estimate that our completeness is @xmath27% for the faintest targets , and close to 100% for the brightest .",
    "the rate of false positives is about @xmath28 in the whole scan . *",
    "two line detections ( id.08 and id.17 ) are spatially consistent with the smg hdf850.1 at @xmath7 @xcite . in the appendix of this paper we present new 2 mm observations encompassing the co(7 - 6 ) and @xmath29 lines of this source . *",
    "no second line is reported at the position of any of the other line candidates , suggesting that , if real , the candidate lines belong to galaxies at intermediate to low redshift ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "* besides hdf850.1 , two line candidates ( id.03 and id.19 ) are considered ` secure ' , being independently confirmed by corollary data .",
    "id.03 is the brightest line in our scan .",
    "it is associated with a fir  bright bzk galaxy .",
    "our follow - up observations with pdbi at 2 mm and with jvla in q band allow us to pin down the redshift of this source @xmath5 , in excellent agreement with the photometric redshift and its sed .",
    "this galaxy lies within the scatter of the ` main sequence ' relation of galaxies . for this source ,",
    "we report a higher co excitation than what has been observed in other bzk galaxies to date .",
    "the other secure line , id.19 , has also an optical / nir counterpart , and fulfills the classification of a bzk galaxy .",
    "this source has an available ( grism ) redshift , consistent with the one inferred from our co detection , at @xmath31 . among the remaining line candidates , nine ( id.01 , 02 , 05 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 15 ,",
    "18 , 20 ) are considered ` high  quality ' .",
    "* we present a detailed study of optical / nir counterparts of our line candidates .",
    "we found one or more optical / nir galaxies that are located within the positional uncertainties of 7 line candidates ( id.02 , 03 , 04 , 12 , 19 , 20 , 21 ) .",
    "we model the optical / nir / mir photometry of these tentative counterparts assuming various co identifications of the line candidates , and we use the goodness of the fit as a criterion to discriminate among different redshift scenarios , when no corollary spectroscopic information is available . we note that some high  quality co line candidates in our survey ( e.g. , id.18 ) lack of any counterpart at other wavelengths , despite the exquisite depth of the available optical / nir / mir data . * we report a possible excess in the fluxes of our line candidates with respect to the predictions based on the evolution of galaxy luminosity functions @xcite as well as extrapolation from optical / nir emissions @xcite .",
    "however , we caution that this comparison includes all the ` secure ' and ` high  quality ' line candidates , although some of them may not be real ( as they still need to be confirmed through follow  up observations of higher@xmath32 lines ) . in an accompanying paper ( w13 )",
    ", we use our measurements to constrain the co luminosity function and the evolution of the h@xmath15 mass density as a function of lookback time . * by collapsing our data cube along the frequency axis , we obtain the deepest 3 mm continuum image available to date .",
    "we clearly detect hdf850.1 , and three additional continuum candidates at @xmath33-@xmath8 level . only one of these fainter sources show a tentative association with a line candidate ( id.01 ) .",
    "neither hdf850.1 nor any of the three other continuum candidates is detected in any optical or ir survey . * using various samples of galaxies selected based on their optical or mir emission , we place sensitive constraints on the dust continuum emission of galaxies at 3 mm .",
    "our results suggest that , at @xmath34 , optical and mir bright galaxies with @xmath35 contribute only to a fraction ( @xmath11% ) of the sfrd at those redshifts , unless their dust sed is better described by starburst template ( m82like , with @xmath36 k ) than by local spiral galaxies ( m51like , with @xmath37 k ) .",
    "this study proves the feasibility of sensitive blind molecular line searches in distant galaxies .",
    "parallel endeavors in the radio window ( e.g. , using jvla to target low-@xmath32 co transitions of high-@xmath13 galaxies ) and at @xmath38 mm wavelengths ( e.g. , in the near future capitalizing on the upgraded capabilities of noema / pdbi and alma ) , will provide us with a new , complete description of the molecular gas properties of star  forming galaxies through cosmic times .",
