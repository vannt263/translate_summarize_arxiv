    "attempts to understand the proton spin in terms of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) have discussed for long time . the european muon collaboration ( emc ) in 1987 showed that one can not explain the proton spin only by quarks in the proton @xcite .",
    "the experiment implied that one should consider the effects not only from the constituent - quark spin , but also from sea quarks , gluons , and corrections at a higher order ( see reviews for the spin problem and related topics in refs . @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "after the experiment , this topic is often called  spin crisis \" or  spin puzzle \" and this is one of challenging problems in qcd even now .    in the point of view of the quantum field theory ,",
    "one expects that one will be able to define the operator definition of the contribution from the quark ( gluon ) spin and quark ( gluon)-orbital - angular - momentum ( oam ) operator in a gauge - invariant way .",
    "although the expectation value for an operator with a state is more important than the operator itself , a couple of decompositions for the total - angular - momentum operator of quarks and gluons in qcd are proposed .",
    "in addition to the spin decomposition , the energy - momentum tensor is closely related to the oam tensor in the quantum field theory and hence the decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor is sometimes discussed in the context of the spin puzzle .",
    "the canonical - energy - momentum tensor in qcd through noether s theorem does not give a gauge - invariant definition , on the other hand , belinfante s definition @xcite is known as the gauge - invariant expression by adding a surface term to the canonical definition ; of course , the surface term does not change the conservation law .",
    "the canonical - energy - momentum tensor derived from noether s theorem leads to so - called jaffe - manohar decomposition @xcite and it perfectly separetes the total contribution into the sum of four terms ; quark - spin , quark - oam , gluon - spin , and gluon - oam with a gauge - variant way . on the other hand ,",
    "belinfante decomposition separetes the quark part from the gluon part in a gauge - invariant way , however , each term is not separeted into the spin and oam term .",
    "the author in ref . @xcite considered the further decomposition of the quark sector and it separates the total - quark - angular - momentum term into the sum of the quark - spin and quark - oam term , and the gluon term is not separated anymore .    in 2008 ,",
    "a new type of gauge - invariant expression for the angumar - momentum and momentum operator was proposed by chen _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite by using split fields for the gluon filed .",
    "this result was applied to the anomalous dimension appeared in the rernormalization group equation ( rge ) of the energy - momentum tensor for quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "this application gives that the momentum fraction carried by gluons in a nucleon at high energies is about one - fifth and this value contradicts to the well - known value , about half , derived by the standard qcd in ref .",
    "the papers by chen _",
    "_ caused intensive debates and a lot of questions .",
    "for example , the uniquness of the decomposition , the dependence of lorentz frame , nonlocarity , and gauge invariance and so on ( see recent reviews @xcite on these debates ) . currently two different decompositions are known as the gauge invariant expressions , namely , the gauge - invariant - canonical ( gic ) decomposition and gauge - invariant - kinetic ( gik ) decomposition . after the paper by chen _",
    "_ appeared , the author in ref .",
    "@xcite extended the original decomposition by chen _",
    "_ to the covariant form in the four dimension , since the original one was the three dimensional one and hence it is not covariant under lorentz transformation .",
    "the gauge transformations to each split field are same with those to the background field and the quantum field in the background field method ( bfm ) .",
    "the bfm is an alternative way to quantize a field theory and it gives the consistent results with those derived by the standard quantization .",
    "originally the bfm was introduced by dewitt for the gravity theory @xcite and applied to gauge theories @xcite . in the bfm",
    ", one adds the _ background - gauge - fixing term _ to the classical yang - mills lagrangian to quantize the theory ; this gauge - fixing term is different from the standard one .",
    "the bfm splits the gauge field into two pieces , namely , the background ( alternatively classical or external ) field and the quantum field . the original gauge transformation to the total gauge - field is separated into two transformations .",
    "this separation of the gauge transformation is not unique and hence a useful one is chosen .",
    "typically we use the gauge transformations so that the background field transforms like the standard gauge - transformation and the quantum field transforms like the simple rotation in the space of the gauge group .",
    "the quantum field is integrated out from the theory in the sense of the path integral and the effective theory after this integration is described by the background field .",
    "one of the advantages of the bfm is the the manifest gauge - invariance of the theory by using the gauge transformation for the background field . the bfm greatly simplifies loop calculations and typically it is used to calculate the beta function of a given theory .",
    "for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the textbook @xcite for calculating the beta function of the non - abelian gauge theory by using two - different ways , respectively ; and see the paper @xcite for the relations among the bfm and ( anti)brst symmetry @xcite , the effective action , and ward identity .",
    "the similarities between the gauge transformations for split gauge fields were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in terms of a path dependence of wilison line and noether s current under the presense of the background gauge field and in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of gluon helicity and a little group in the lorentz group .",
    "acutally the author in ref .",
    "@xcite evaluated the anomalous dimension of the gic - energy - momentum tensor again and concluded that the results was same with the result in ref .",
    "however the author calculated it by own method @xcite . on the other hand , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite adopted the coulomb gauge .",
    "hence , an analysis based on the bfm with a covariant way at the one - loop order was not carried out .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the one - loop corrections to the anomalous dimensions based on the bfm , because the gic decomposition includes split gauge - fields obeying the same gauge - transformation laws for the background and quantum field in the bfm .",
    "the results show that the application of the bfm correctly reproduces two results in the quark sectors of chen _ et al . _",
    "s anomalous - dimension matrix ; however , the results in gluonic sectors show the inconsistency in the renormalization for the gluon field in the bfm .",
    "then we considered a trick to overcome this inconsistency and the method led two results : 1 ) the third result of chen _ et al . _",
    "s anomalous dimensions is recovered , 2 ) on the other hand , the fourth result does not coincide with chen _",
    "s result .",
    "even worse , the gauge dependence dose not cancels in the result .",
    "these results seem to show that the application of the bfm to this problem ( at least quark sectors ) works well , however , the treatment of the gluonic sector is not perfect .",
    "motivated by our observations , in this paper , we focus on the evaluation of the anomalous dimensions by the bfm , in particular , we compare the anomalous dimensions derived from the belinfante - improved - energy - momentum tensor by the bfm with those derived from the gic - energy - momentum tensor by the bfm .",
    "the analysis in this paper shows that the possible origin of the inconsistency and the imperfect result are from the condition @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we point out two checkpoints to test the gic decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor ; namely , the gauge independence in the gluon - to - gluon sector and the zero eigenvalue in the anomalous - dimension matrix .",
    "the rge for the energy - momentum tensor in qcd is briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec.short.review.rge ] . in particular , the gauge cancellation of the feynman diagrams and the asymptotic behavior of the momentum fraction carried by gluons in a nucleon at high energies are focused .",
    "the same results of the anomalous dimension can be obtained by the bfm in qcd .",
    "the gauge cancellation in the feynman diagrams by the bfm is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec.short.review.gamma.bfm ] .",
    "our analysis of the anomalous dimension based on the gic - energy - momentum tensor by the bfm is showed in sec .",

    "_ s results in the quark sector of the anomalous dimension are derived by the bfm and how gluonic sectors lead to the problems .",
    "we consider a trick to overcome these problems in the gluonic sectors .",
    "in particular , the detail of comparison of our results with the literature is discussed and two checkpoints for testing the gic decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor are pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec.discussion ] .",
    "last , sec .",
    "[ sec.conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion of this paper and to show a future perspective .",
    "the asymptotic limit of the momentum fraction carried by gluons in a nucleon at high energies can be predicted by the standard qcd @xcite . in this section , we briefly review two topics : 1 ) how the gauge dependence is canceled and 2 ) how the asymptotic limit is derived .",
    "we begin with the definition of belinfante - improved - energy - momentum tensor : @xmath1 where the symbol @xmath2 is the symmetrization symbol and the terms including @xmath3 are ignored since that do not contribute to the three - dimensional - momentum operator of the quark and gluon . the related feynman - rules for these operators can be easily derived .",
    "for example , the feynman rules for the quark - quark vertex with a momentum @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and for the quark - quark - gluon interaction with the gluon of the lorentz index @xmath6 and the color @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are given by @xmath9 the feynman rule for the vertex @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12 , \\label{fig.feynman.rule.qcd.2g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the feynman rule for the @xmath13 vertex , @xmath14 , is given by @xmath15 ,                    { \\nonumber}\\\\ \\label{fig.feynman.rule.qcd.3g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all momentum is incoming .",
    "to evaluate the anomalous dimension for the energy - momentum tensor in eq .",
    "( [ eq.bel.tmunu ] ) by the standard qcd , we have to extract divergences of the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.qcd](a ) ,  ( b ) ,  ( c ) , and ( d )",
    ". basically we focus on the one - particle - irreducible part of the diagrams without external lines ; however the external lines are assumed to combine with the one - particle - irreducible part .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     first , we consider the quark sector @xmath16 .",
    "it is obvious that fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](a ) does not have the second and third diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.bfm](a ) .",
    "this difference can be easily understand by the bfm , namely , the background field can not propagate in loop diagrams in order to keep the gauge invariance of final results .",
    "taking into account this difference , we can reproduce the first chen _ et al . _",
    "s result , @xmath17 , namely : @xmath18 in addition , the feynman rule in eq .",
    "( [ eq.feynman.rule.gic.2g ] ) is different from the standard rule in eq .",
    "( [ eq.feynman.rule.bfm.2g ] ) and hence fig .  [ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](c ) reproduces the second chen _",
    "s result @xmath19 as @xmath20    next , we consider the gluonic sector @xmath21 .",
    "it is easy to see that fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](b ) gives the same divergent structure with that in the standard qcd , because the bfm does not change the loop structure like vertexes and fermion propagators in the diagrams .",
    "hence , at first glance , we may conclude the result , @xmath22 . however , this is not correct and we encounter the problem at the renormalization of this result in the bfm , namely , the absence of the counter terms for the external lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](b ) .",
    "although we have to renormalize the theory by the external field @xmath23 according to the bfm , we have no such a term in the original definition of @xmath24 . consequently , we can not remove the divergence and can not define the anomalous dimension of @xmath25 by using the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq.gic.tmunu ] ) in the bfm . moreover , the same problem appears in the gluon - to - gluon sector , namely , fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](d ) in computing @xmath26 .",
    "here we consider an adhoc method to avoid the problem appeared in the previous subsection .",
    "one of the reasons why the counter term disappeared is because of the condition @xmath0 .",
    "we have already used this condition in deriving the definition of @xmath27 .",
    "hence we may try to keep this condition nonzero and set it zero at the end of the calculation . in order to improve the gluonic sector , we go back to the definition of @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.gic.tmunu ] ) and keep @xmath28",
    ". then we find that eq.([eq.gic.tmunu ] ) should be corrected by the new definition : @xmath29 , \\label{eq.gic.prime.tmunu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript  gic@xmath30  \" stands for the new definition of the gic - energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this new definition does not change the @xmath31 interaction . by using the new definition",
    ", we can recover the gluonic counter term to remove the divergence and it reproduces the third result of chen _ el al . _",

    "( [ eq.symm.factor ] ) lead to the following result for @xmath33 : @xmath36 where this result depends on the gauge parameter .",
    "this adhoc method partially works to recover the gluonic counter terms and to reproduce @xmath37 and seems to fail in @xmath33 due to the additional term .",
    "first , the naive application of the bfm to the anomalous dimension for the gic - energy - momentum tensor succeeded to reproduce chen _",
    "_ s anomalous dimension correctly , except for the gluonic sectors .",
    "our results contradicted to ref .",
    "the author in ref .",
    "@xcite developed own method introducing the projection operator to pick up the physical degree of freedom for @xmath38 @xcite ; the autor s conclusion was that the gic - energy - momentum tensor gives the standard results derived by ref .",
    "however , in generally speaking , the gic - energy - momentum could give a different result , because the gic definition is different from the belinfante definition by the surface term .",
    "our explicit calculations based on the bfm give the different feynman - diagrams and feynman - rules and finally recovered the most of chen _ et al . _",
    "s anomalous - dimension matrix .",
    "we can remember a good example in the belinfante definition to see how a surface term changes physics . as it is known well that the canonical - energy - momentum tensor derived from noether s theorem is not always gauge invariant , the belinfante - improved - energy - momentum tensor derived from the canonical - energy - momentum tensor by adding the surface term is gauge invariant and it gives the gauge independent results at the one - loop order @xcite and even at the two - loop order @xcite .",
    "next , we focus on how our results can be different from the standard results and how chen _ et al . _",
    "s results are derived from the bfm .",
    "first , we consider @xmath39 . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.bfm](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](a ) , it is clear that the gic definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq.gic.tmunu ] ) does not generate the second and third diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.bfm](a ) , because eq .  ( [ eq.gic.tmunu ] ) does not include the propagating field @xmath38 in the bfm .",
    "the absence of the propagating field comes from the surface term , namely , the potential - momentum term .",
    "hence this difference gives our first - result , @xmath40 .",
    "second , we consider @xmath41 derived from fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](c ) .",
    "although the related feynman - diagram is same between fig .  [ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.bfm](c ) , the related feynman - rule for @xmath31 interaction is different to each other .",
    "this change also comes from the surface term .",
    "hence this difference gives our second - result , @xmath42 .",
    "third , on the evaluation @xmath37 , the loop structures of fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](b ) is same with that of fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.bfm](b ) and it seems to give the same divergence .",
    "although there was no corresponding counter term to remove this divergence in the original definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq.gic.tmunu ] ) , now we have the counter term thanks to the new definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq.gic.prime.tmunu ] ) .",
    "the absence of this counter term is related to the treatment of @xmath43 appeared in the surface term . if we keep it nonzero , we can keep the suitable counter term to reproduce the anomalous dimension @xmath37 .",
    "hence we can reproduce our third - result , @xmath44 .",
    "last , we focus on the anomalous dimension @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](d ) and in particular how it is different from fig .  [",
    "fig.feynman.diagram.bfm](d ) .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](d ) is the same with fig .",
    "[ fig.feynman.diagram.gic.bfm](d ) , the feynman rules in eqs .",
    "( [ eq.feynman.rule.gic.2g ] ) and ( [ eq.feynman.rule.gicprime.3g ] ) are different from the standard qcd with the bfm ; hence the cancellation of the gauge dependence which works both in the standard method and in the bfm is altered .",
    "actually , we obtain the gauge - dependent result because of this altered gauge - cancellation .",
    "these results mean that the application of the bfm itself will be consistent with the chen _",
    "s quark - sector results , however , the adhoc method to improve the gluonic sectors is not enough to reproduce the gluonic results perfectly .",
    "furthermore , the problem of the gluonic term is the counter term and it seems to be related to the condition @xmath0 . in particular , the gluon - to - gluon sector , @xmath33 ,",
    "is sensitive to the way how we treat this condition and our adhoc method lead to the strange result that the  gauge - invariant - canonical \" definition gives the gauge - dependent result .",
    "this strange result will be improved , if we can correctly treat the condition of @xmath0 at the one - loop order within the bfm .",
    "most importantly , it is not quite obvious whether we can exactly reproduce chen _",
    "s @xmath45 or not ; namely , we may obtain a gauge - independent result like the form @xmath46 with @xmath47 , even after we correctly handle the condition @xmath0 at the one - loop order within the bfm by an improved method .",
    "this is because that the calculation of the anomalous dimension for the gic - energy - momentum tensor is not explicitly checked by a covariant way within the bfm .",
    "therefore , the gauge independence and the gluonic contribution which is proportional to @xmath48 factor in @xmath26 are nontrivial .",
    "however , if we obtain the gauge - invariant result like @xmath49 with @xmath50 , then such a solution of the rge will give a scale - dependent result for the total energy - momentum tensor and can not be a physical result .",
    "this is because that the scale independence in the total - energy - momentum tensor is the consequence of the energy - momentum conservation and it is achieved by the zero eigenvalue in the anomalous - dimension matrix at the one - loop order ; the zero eigenvalue requires @xmath51 .",
    "hence we expect that the improved method to handle the gluonic sectors of the anomalous dimensions will give the result @xmath52 , if the gic definition is physically correct .",
    "in other words , the gic definition of the energy - momentum tensor is unphysical , if @xmath53 with @xmath54 for @xmath55 .    in any case , one needs more theoretical developments on the treatment of the gluonic terms at a higher order with a covariant way within the bfm .",
    "one of the possible way is a method of lagrange multiplier to handle this condition in the quantum field theory @xcite and we will discuss it in the future publication .",
    "we have studied the anomalous - dimension matrix for the gauge - invariant - canonical definition of the energy - momentum tensor by the background field method .",
    "the analysis reproduced chen _",
    "s anomalous - dimension matrix except for the gluonic sectors and the reason why we could not derive the gluonic sectors is the absence of the gluonic counter term ; namely , the naive gic - definition has the inconsistency in the renormalization in the bfm .",
    "this inconsistency comes from the condition @xmath0 , that is , how we treat this condition in the whole calculation .",
    "then we considered an adhoc method to overcome this problem by keeping @xmath43 nonzero by the end of the all calculation and the anomalous dimension @xmath56 in chen _",
    "s result was correctly derived ; however , @xmath57 was not derived and the gauge dependence remains in the final result .",
    "this means that we could reproduce three - quarter of chen _ et al .",
    "_ s results , @xmath17 , @xmath19 , and @xmath56 by the bfm .",
    "the current results in the attempt to derive the anomalous dimensions of the gic - energy - momentum tensor by the bfm implies that we have to develop a method to handle the condition @xmath0 correctly without losing the renormalizability in the bfm",
    ". a possible way will be to introduce a lagrange multiplier to this condition .",
    "in particular , the explicit path integral formalism will be necessary to achieve this purpose .",
    "furtheremore , we pointed out _ two checkpoints _ to test the validity of the gic - energy - momentum tensor ; that is , gauge - invariant results for all matrix element of the anomalous dimension and the zero eigenvalue .",
    "although we focused on the renormalization group equation and the anomalous dimension of the gic - energy - momentum tensor , this application of the bfm to the gic decomposition of the total - angular - momentum tensors for the quark and gluon should be considered in the future , because the anomalous dimensions of the total - angular - momentum tensor is related to those of the energy - momentum tensor @xcite .",
    "therefore the complete treatment of the gic and gik decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor based on the bfm is important and it is necessary to check its consistency in the renormalization of the gluonic term at a higher order .",
