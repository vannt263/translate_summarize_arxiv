    "in the millennium year we celebrated the 30_th _ anniversary of the famous eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the basic result of polyakov and of koba , nielsen and olesen concerning the asymptotic behavior of the multiplicity distributions  @xcite .",
    "these authors put forward the hypothesis that at very high energies  @xmath6 the probability distributions @xmath7 of producing @xmath8 particles in a certain collision process should exhibit the scaling ( homogeneity ) relation @xmath9 as @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the average multiplicity of secondaries at collision energy  @xmath6 .",
    "this so - called kno scaling hypothesis asserts that if we rescale @xmath7 measured at different energies via stretching ( shrinking ) the vertical ( horizontal ) axes by @xmath11 , these rescaled curves will coincide with each other .",
    "that is , the multiplicity distributions become simple rescaled copies of the universal function @xmath12 depending only on the scaled multiplicity @xmath13 . in the picturesque terminology of stanley  @xcite the rescaled data points @xmath7 measured at different energies  @xmath6 collapse onto the unique scaling curve @xmath12 . after koba  @xcite ,",
    "let me illustrate this schematically :     @xmath14     the data collapsing behavior is a fundamental property of homogeneous functions . according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , at very high energies the multiplicity distributions @xmath7 are homogeneous functions of degree @xmath15 of @xmath8 and @xmath11 .",
    "homogeneity rules play a central role in the theory of critical phenomena  @xcite . near the critical point of a physical system",
    "the thermodynamic functions exhibit homogeneous form which implies the existence of a law of corresponding states : using a suitably chosen scaling transformation it is possible to bring different states of the same system to coincidence and thus to compress many experimental or theoretical results into a compact form . the kno scaling hypothesis eq .",
    "( 1 ) is just such a law of corresponding states .",
    "in the celebrated paper  @xcite koba , nielsen and olesen showed that the validity of feynman scaling is a sufficient condition for eq .",
    "( 1 ) to hold .",
    "it is worth mentioning however that the mathematical rigor of their derivation was criticized by several authors .",
    "moreover , the precise finding of ref .",
    "@xcite was the energy independence of the moments @xmath16 in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "the scaling hypothesis eq .",
    "( 1 ) was formulated with the additional assumption that the moments @xmath17 determine uniquely the scaling function @xmath12 .",
    "polyakov arrived at the asymptotic multiplicity scaling law eq .",
    "( 1 ) two years earlier than koba , nielsen and olesen by formulating a similarity hypothesis for strong interactions in @xmath18 annihilation ; see later .",
    "somehow this fundamental and elegant work was almost completely ignored in the early 70s and eq .",
    "( 1 ) became known as the kno scaling hypothesis in the high - energy physics community .",
    "the scaling relation eq .",
    "( 1 ) can hold only approximately since multiplicity  @xmath8 is a discrete random variable whose stretching or shrinking by a scale factor leaves the probabilities  @xmath0 unaltered .",
    "the proper meaning of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is that with increasing collision energy  @xmath6 the discrete multiplicity distributions @xmath0 can be approximated with increasing accuracy by a continuous probability density function @xmath19 via @xmath20 ( kno prescription ) or by @xmath21 ( called kno - g `` scaling '' ) where , in the most popular modification of the original scaling rule , @xmath19 has the generic czyewski - rybicki form  @xcite f(x)= ( ) with scale parameter @xmath22 and location parameter @xmath2 . data collapsing behavior is observed if the only @xmath6-dependent parameters of the approximate shape function @xmath19 are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i.e. if @xmath19 depends on collision energy only through a change of location and scale in  @xmath23 .",
    "the variation of @xmath3 with increasing  @xmath6 reflects the growth of average multiplicity , whereas the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath2 is usually associated with leading particle effects ( so - called akno or kno-@xmath24 scaling ) .",
    "other physical explanations are also possible , see e.g. the contribution of marek poszajczak on @xmath25-scaling .",
    "taking into account a possible location change ( shift ) in multiplicity rarely proved to be sufficient to restore the data collapsing behavior of @xmath0 when the original scaling law eq .",
    "( 1 ) is violated at very high energies ( hence we use ) .",
    "nevertheless , the principle of scale _ and _ location change in the shape of multiplicity distributions can be extremely powerful through the following generalization of the kno scaling rule . consider that the multiplicity distributions , more precisely the continuous probability densities @xmath19 approximating @xmath0 generate @xmath6-dependent shifting and rescaling in mellin space .",
    "the mellin transform of a probability density @xmath19 is defined by @xmath26 and it provides the @xmath27_th _ moment @xmath28 . via the functional relation @xmath29 one can introduce translation and dilatation in the moments rank @xmath30 by performing the transformation @xmath31 of the probability densities approximating the shape of @xmath0 . in the followings",
    "i shall illustrate the utility of performing a location or scale change in mellin space ; for further details , see refs .  @xcite .",
    "there are several possible dynamical explanations of a shift in mellin space .",
    "the basic idea is simply the following . recall that in eq .",
    "( 1 ) the normalization of the kno function reads @xmath32 that is , @xmath33 .",
    "assume that violation of kno scaling is observed and we measure @xmath6-dependent `` scaling '' functions @xmath12 . in order to arrive at data collapsing behavior of @xmath0",
    "the simplest possibility is to rescale the function @xmath34 by its first moment given by @xmath35 . in terms of @xmath0 and",
    "the moments @xmath36 this corresponds to rescaling the distribution @xmath37 by its mean @xmath38 . the distribution @xmath39 is known in the mathematical literature as the first _ moment distribution _ of @xmath0 .",
    "if the rescaling of @xmath39 by @xmath40 is not sufficient to arrive at data collapsing behavior , one can try the same recipe for the higher - order moment distributions @xmath41 .",
    "the generalization is straightforward .",
    "let me show you now an example when eq .",
    "( 1 ) is clearly violated , but performing a shift in mellin space can restore the collapse of different @xmath0 curves onto a single scaling curve .",
    "the most obvious example is intermittency . as it turned out during the past 15 years",
    ", multiparticle production often yields scale - invariant density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "this can be observed through the power - law scaling @xmath42 of the normalized moments @xmath43 of @xmath44 as the bin - size  @xmath45 in phase - space is varied ( for clarity , we neglect here the influence of low count rates ) .",
    "assuming that the fluctuations show monofractal structure , the so - called intermittency exponents @xmath46 are given by  @xmath47 and the anomalous fractal dimensions @xmath48 are , @xmath49 .",
    "the normalized moments @xmath50 of @xmath44 take the form @xmath51^{\\,q-1}\\qquad\\mbox{for}\\quad q>2\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath52 independent of bin - size  @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "of course eq .",
    "( 1 ) , with @xmath53 , is violated since we observe @xmath54 .    in the restoration of data collapsing behavior of @xmath0 for self - similar fluctuations",
    "the basic trick is the investigation of the higher - order moment distributions defined before .",
    "their moments are @xmath55 , that is , the moments of the original @xmath0 are transformed out up to @xmath56th order via performing a shift in mellin space , see eq .",
    "( 3 ) . for @xmath57",
    "the normalized moments of the first moment distribution @xmath39 are found to be @xmath58^{\\,q } $ ] in terms of the original @xmath50 and comparison to eq .",
    "( 4 ) yields @xmath59 for monofractal multiplicity fluctuations . since the coefficients @xmath52",
    "are independent of bin - size  @xmath45 , we see that monofractality yields not only _ power - law scaling _ of the normalized moments of @xmath0 but also _ data collapsing _ behavior of the first moment distributions @xmath39 measured at different resolution scales @xmath45 . increasing the ( possibly fractional ) rank  @xmath56 of the moment distributions allows the restoration of data collapsing behavior in the presence of increasing degree of multifractality of scale - invariant multiplicity fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the effect of low multiplicities ( poisson noise ) can be taken into account via the study of _ factorial _ moment distributions @xmath60}p_n/\\langle n^{[r]}\\rangle$ ] and their factorial moments .      in recent years",
    "considerable interest has been devoted to the ginzburg - landau theory of the phase transition from quark - gluon plasma to hadronic matter  @xcite . instead of a strict power - law scaling @xmath61 of the normalized factorial moments , a so - called @xmath62-scaling behavior @xmath63^{\\beta_q}$ ]",
    "is obtained with @xmath64 . for second - order transition @xmath65 and in case of a first - order transition @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath62-scaling rule of the above form makes difficult to identify the family of probability laws @xmath0 belonging to the model . but",
    "considering @xmath39 instead of @xmath0 the corresponding factorial moments turn out to be @xmath67^{\\beta_q}$ ] with @xmath68 and hence  @xcite @xmath69^{\\beta_q}\\qquad\\mbox{with}\\quad          \\beta_q=\\frac{q^\\nu - q}{2^\\nu-2}.\\ ] ] this form of @xmath62-scaling is the familiar log - lvy law  @xcite with stability index @xmath70 .",
    "thus , via moment shifting , we succeeded in identifying @xmath39 for the ginzburg - landau formalism with a strict bound on the essential parameter  @xmath71 of the model .",
    "the theoretically relevant values are within the allowed range .",
    "although this particular example is not related directly to data collapsing behavior of multiplicity distributions , it illustrates the utility of the moment distributions @xmath72 which correspond to translation in mellin space .",
    "the most important reason of a possible change of scale in mellin space comes from qcd . in higher - order pqcd calculations , allowing a more precise account of energy conservation in the course of multiple parton splittings , the natural variable of the multiplicity moments is the _ rescaled _ rank @xmath73 instead of rank @xmath30 itself  @xcite with @xmath74 being the multiplicity anomalous dimension of qcd . because of the running of the strong coupling constant @xmath75 , it is inevitable to adjust an energy dependent scale factor in mellin space if one wants to arrive at data collapsing behavior of the multiplicity distributions @xmath7 .      in the very first paper",
    "predicting the multiplicity scaling law eq .",
    "( 1 ) , polyakov constructed a model for the short - distance behavior of strong interactions based on the hypothesis of asymptotic scale- and conformal invariance  @xcite . when applied to the process of @xmath5 annihilation to hadrons at asymptotically high collision energies ,",
    "the model predicts that multihadron production goes in a cascade way .",
    "first , a few heavy virtual objects , called jets , are formed .",
    "these are repeatedly diminished in a branching process until the masses of the subsequent generation jets become at some very late stage comparable to the hadronic masses .",
    "this cascading mechanism gives rise to multiplicity distributions @xmath7 satisfying eq .",
    "( 1 ) and the scaling function @xmath12 behaves as @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 being a monomial .",
    "up to a scale factor , @xmath12 is a negative binomial type scaling function , that is , a gamma distribution  @xcite in the rescaled and power - transformed multiplicity  @xmath79 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the above result was achieved years earlier than the emergence of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "interestingly , the predictions of qcd obey some important similarities to the findings of polyakov :    _ 1 ) _ hadronic jets produced in hard processes are expected in qcd to be self - similar objects composed of subsequent parton branching decays  @xcite . a highly virtual quark or gluon decays into secondaries which are less off - shell and less energetic .",
    "each of these intermediate decay products splits into novel ones .",
    "the subsequent decay chain steps form a scale - invariant branching process which continues until the virtual mass of the quanta becomes approximately 1  gev .",
    "_ 2 ) _ the fragmentation of partons in qcd leads to the typical characteristics of branching processes , in particular , to long - range correlations and to the validity of kno scaling  @xcite .",
    "further , it was shown  @xcite that kno scaling in @xmath5 annihilation is the consequence of the scale - invariance ( asymptotic freedom ) in the presence of gluon self - coupling .",
    "it is thus the manifestation of the essence of the non - abelian gauge theory of strong interactions .",
    "_ 3 ) _ taking into account the higher pqcd effects responsible for energy - momentum conservation in parton jets , the kno scaling function in @xmath5 annihilation was shown  @xcite to be identical to polyakov s form : ( z)=nz^k-1(-[dz]^ ) where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 is a scale parameter depending on @xmath84 , with @xmath84 being the qcd anomalous dimension , @xmath85 at lep1 .",
    "hence , the conservation laws strongly reduce the width of the kno scaling function as compared to the exponential fall - off obtained by lower - order pqcd calculations .",
    "the experimental data at @xmath86  gev ( dots ) confirm the prediction ( curve ) as illustrated in the figure  a ) below ( with the exception that @xmath87 turns out to be larger , @xmath88 ) .",
    "the crucial difference between the qcd prediction and polyakov s result lies in the fact that the scaling function @xmath12 given by the polyakov - dokshitzer form eq .",
    "( 5 ) _ depends _ on collision energy  @xmath6 in qcd .",
    "that is , qcd predicts violation of kno scaling in @xmath5 annihilation which becomes clearly visible at higher energies .",
    "this effect is due to the running of the strong coupling constant @xmath75 , hence @xmath89 as @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath90 asymptotically  @xcite .",
    "therefore the tail of @xmath12 widens with increasing  @xmath6 which gives rise to the kno scaling violation pattern shown in the figure  b ) below .",
    "asymptotically the exponential fall - off predicted by the double logarithmic approximation is recovered ( solid curve ) i.e. the negative binomial type scaling form of @xmath7 .",
    "thus we have learned that the pre - qcd and qcd - based descriptions of @xmath5 annihilation to hadrons make essential use of self - similar branching processes , further , both predict the rescaled and power - transformed multiplicity variable  @xmath79 to be gamma - distributed .",
    "but in the pre - qcd approach the exponent @xmath91 is independent of collision energy  @xmath6 and kno scaling holds valid , as expected for scale - invariant branching with _ fixed coupling_. on the contrary , the qcd - based calculations predict violation of kno scaling since @xmath91 varies with collision energy  @xmath6 , due to the _ running _ of @xmath75 .",
    "note however that in the latter case data collapsing can be restored in a simple way using _ logarithmic _ scaling variable . for the polyakov - dokshitzer form of @xmath12 given by ( 5 ) we have @xmath92 since only the exponent @xmath91 and scale parameter @xmath83 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) are expected to depend on collision energy  @xmath6 through the variation of @xmath74 , kno scaling violated by qcd effects is recovered by plotting @xmath93 as displayed in the figure  c ) .",
    "the scale change in logarithmic multiplicity is governed by the qcd multiplicity anomalous dimension .",
    "this particular type of data collapsing of the multiplicity distributions @xmath7 is called log - kno scaling  @xcite since we have the behavior of type eq .",
    "( 2 ) except that distributions of the logarithmic multiplicity satisfy it .      it may turn out that the log - kno scaling law has ubiquitous appearance in multiparticle dynamics .",
    "random multiplicative cascades play a distinguished role in the dynamics underlying multihadron production , both in soft and hard processes .",
    "the multiplicative cascade models like for example the @xmath24-model and @xmath94-model are in the focus of interest since the pioneering work of biaas and peschanski  @xcite , see also  @xcite for a review .",
    "recently , frisch and sornette developed a theory of extreme deviations  @xcite which predicts for multiplication of random variables the generic presence of stretched exponential distributions @xmath95 with @xmath96 . to be specific ,",
    "consider the product @xmath97 of independent random variables @xmath98 distributed identically according to the probability density @xmath99",
    ". the above product can arise in a cascade process if primary entities ( e.g. particle density ) of initial size @xmath100 are repeatedly diminished in random proportions , so that after @xmath101 cascade steps we have the product .        in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that under mild regularity conditions the distribution of the product variable @xmath102 exhibits the asymptotic behavior _",
    "n(x)~^n xand for finite  @xmath101 . frisch and sornette call attention to the intuitive interpretation of ( 6 ) : the tail of @xmath103",
    "is controlled by the realizations where all terms in the product are of the same order hence @xmath103 is , to leading order , just the product of the @xmath101 densities @xmath94 , each having the common argument @xmath104 . when @xmath105 is chosen to be @xmath106 with @xmath107 , then eq .",
    "( 6 ) leads to stretched exponential tails @xmath108 for large @xmath101 , with stretching exponent @xmath109 . expecting the cascade depth @xmath101 to be an increasing function of collision energy @xmath6 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) breaks down but data collapsing can be recovered in the log - kno manner discussed previously .",
    "the most exciting and challenging task in developing novel scaling relations is testing them on real data . in case of multiplicity distributions the kno scaling laws eqs .",
    "( 1 - 2 ) are known to be strongly violated above isr energies .",
    "this violation is most visible for the multiplicity data measured by the e735 collaboration  @xcite see also  @xcite for more details . in the followings i provide a very brief summary of some preliminary results of a study of the e735 data .",
    "the e735 collaboration recently published the full phase - space multiplicity distributions in @xmath110 and @xmath4 collisions at c.m .",
    "energies @xmath111 300 , 546 , 1000 and 1800 gev at tevatron  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 curves corresponding to @xmath111 300 and 1800 gev are displayed in the following two figures .",
    "it is apparent that bimodal shape of the @xmath0 curves arises at tev energies , obeying a ( not too pronounced ) shoulder structure like at sps .",
    "it is argued  @xcite that the low - multiplicity regimes are affected mainly by single parton collisions and exhibit kno scaling , whereas the tail of the distributions is influenced more heavily by double parton interactions and violate kno scaling substantially",
    ". another possible explanation of the observed @xmath0 shape is the weighted superposition of a soft and semihard component , the latter one being dominated by minijet production .",
    "these components are responsible of the kno scaling and kno - violating regimes of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the solid curves in the previous two plots represent the polyakov - dokshitzer parametrization eq .",
    "( 5 ) fitted to the kno - violating @xmath112 component of the e735 data .",
    "the quality of fits is reasonably good ( for all data sets ) as can be depicted from the figures .",
    "the fits correspond to @xmath113 kept fixed and @xmath91 decreasing from @xmath114 to @xmath115 as one goes from @xmath111 300 gev to 1800 gev .",
    "our findings indicate that the kno violating component of the e735 multiplicity distributions can be collapsed onto a single scaling curve in the log - kno manner discussed previously .",
    "it is illustrated below .    in the upper figure",
    "the @xmath111 300 and 1800 gev data sets are displayed only , whereas in the lower plot all the four data sets measured by the e735 experiment .",
    "the collapse of the data points onto a unique scaling curve is apparent .",
    "this very preliminary investigation suggests that the pattern of kno scaling violation by double parton collisions , or by semihard processes dominated by minijet production , is similar to that of @xmath5 annihilations where log - kno behavior is expected to arise as well at high energies ( see before ) .",
    "but note that in parameter @xmath87 there is an order of magnitude difference between @xmath5 and @xmath4 collisions , that is , the scaling functions have different shapes in the two reactions .",
    "one of the earliest reviews  @xcite of polyakov s pioneering work concluded with the following speculative note : `` could it be that as in the theory of critical phenomena , while the basic physics ( hamiltonians ) between @xmath5 annihilation and hadronic multiparticle production could be entirely different , multiplicity scaling may yet still be a feature shared by both ? '' in the light of our findings the answer to this question is _ yes _ but the scaling behavior foreseen 30 years ago arises in the logarithm of multiplicity instead of multiplicity itself .",
    "in the past 30 years , data collapsing of multiplicity distributions @xmath0 according to the generic kno scaling relation eq .",
    "( 2 ) was one of the most extensively studied topics in soft physics .",
    "unfortunately , more and more experimental and theoretical results confirm that eq .",
    "( 2 ) is too simple to be true .",
    "the information content of @xmath0 can be represented in an equally convenient manner making use of the multiplicity moments .",
    "for example , validity of eq .",
    "( 2 ) corresponds to constancy of the normalized central moments for appropriately chosen @xmath2 and @xmath3 . what can we do if the kno scaling rule  ( 2 ) breaks down ?",
    "how data collapsing behavior of @xmath0 can be restored , if it is  possible at all ?",
    "the approach presented here is extremely simple : let s perform the original scaling transformation ( shifting and ) in the multiplicity moments rank , that is , in mellin space , rather than in multiplicity .    the functional relation eq .",
    "( 3 ) tells how things transform at the level of @xmath0 .",
    "translation in mellin space ( moment shifting ) corresponds to changing from @xmath0 to the moment distributions @xmath72 .",
    "this makes possible to arrive at data collapsing for intermittency phenomena : e.g. @xmath39 scales for monofractal fluctuations , @xmath116 for bifractals and so on .",
    "dilatation in mellin space ( rescaling of moments rank ) corresponds to the transformation @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "therefore data collapsing arises in rescaled logarithmic multiplicity ( log - kno ) .",
    "such behavior is expected to occur for phenomena governed by running coupling effects or in multiplicative cascades of varying length .",
    "considering the physical significance of the mentioned examples in multiparticle dynamics , it will be interesting to see how the proposed scaling behaviors show up in the experiments of the third millennium .",
