    "the properties of the faintest regions of galactic disks are linked to the mechanisms involved in the growing and shaping of galaxies .",
    "these outer parts are affected by interactions with the nearby galaxies and so their characteristics are connected with the evolution followed by the galaxies . in other words ,",
    "the stellar structure of the outer parts of galactic disks is a fundamental element of evidence for understanding the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies . since patterson ( 1940 ) , de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) and freeman ( 1970 ) we know that the slope of the radial , stellar light distribution is described by an exponential decline .",
    "however , this exponential light distribution does not always extend to arbitrarily large radii , but it is often truncated at a well - defined @xmath0 ( van der kruit 1979 , de grijs et al",
    ".  2001 ; pohlen et al .",
    ". in the optical this break occurs at galactocentric distances of typically 2 - 3 radial scale - lengths ( pohlen & trujillo 2006 ) and it is best described with a broken exponential with a clear break and a _ downbending _ , steeper outer region ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this truncation radius could be used as a new intrinsic parameter measuring the size of galactic disks and may be linked to their formation and evolution as shown by trujillo & pohlen ( 2005 ) . at present , we do not have a secure understanding for the origin of these _ outer edges _ , and the hypotheses proposed range from explaining truncations as remains of the initial galaxy formation process ( van der kruit 1987 ) being a relic of the galaxy evolution over the lifetime ( seiden et al .",
    "another possible and interesting explanation assumes the existence of a critical co density acting as a star formation threshold .",
    "if the observed falloff in the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the outer parts persists for sufficient time , it should introduce a visible truncation of the stellar luminosity profile at that radius .",
    "a typical threshold of the molecular gas density , below which the star formation process is inhibited , is in the range from 3 to 10 m@xmath1 pc@xmath2 according to schaye ( 2004 ) .",
    "this threshold may be observed by measuring the local column density of molecular gas and correlating it with the current sfr in the same galaxy regions .",
    "we are interested to find a change in the local co emission across the optical break radius ( or the typical position for it ) , while comparing truncated with non - truncated galaxies .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "these first results encourage us to continue to explore with new observations the extension of co beyond the optical radius and to see whether this is different for truncated or untruncated galaxies .",
    "this possible difference could allow us to test the theory that assumes the existence of a critical co density acting as a star formation threshold .",
    "we will also compare with other gas tracers in the outer parts of galaxies .",
    "indeed the co tracers might suffer from caveats : the co line emission requires excitation , that could be lacking in the absence of new stars around .",
    "co emission also depends on metallicity , which is decrasing in the outer parts of galaxies .",
