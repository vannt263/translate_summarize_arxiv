    "at the star experiment we can collect hundreds of million ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "light nuclei and anti - nuclei emerge from these collisions during the last stage of the collision process .",
    "the quantum wave functions of the constituent nucleons or anti - nucleons , if close enough in momentum and coordinate space , will overlap to produce composite systems .",
    "the production rate for the systems with baryon or anti - baryon b is proportional to the baryon or anti - baryon density in momentum and coordinate space , raised to the power @xmath3b@xmath3 , and therefore exhibits exponential behavior as a function of @xmath3b@xmath3 .",
    "figure 1 shows the exponential@xcite invariant yields versus baryon number in @xmath4=200 gev central au+au collisions .",
    "empirically , the production rate reduces by a factor of 1.1 x @xmath5(1.6 x @xmath5 ) for each additional nucleon ( anti - nucleon ) added .",
    "the measurement of hundreds of million of events make it possible to probe up to a scale of five in baryon number .",
    "the baryon four data points come from a star measurement published in ref.@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there are no baryon five nuclear fragments that live long enough or decay weakly such that they would have a displaced vertex@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner :    sec .",
    "1 explores nuclear states that have been measured .",
    "sec . 2 explores the possibility of detecting strongly decaying exotic states .",
    "the dibaryon(2.15 ) @xmath0 = @xmath1 state which decays into d @xmath2 is considered .",
    "in the above section the states decayed by the weak interaction . the possibility of detecting strongly decaying exotic states is considered using the dibaryon(2.15 ) @xmath0 = @xmath1 state which decays into d @xmath2 as an example . in the qgp(quark gluon plasma ) six quarks or anti - quarks could come together to form a deuteron or anti - deuteron .",
    "however such states are loosely bound and easily destroyed in the hadronic phase .",
    "the cross section for @xmath6 @xmath2 scattering is 240 mb .",
    "this implies that the deuteron can only be formed in the final freeze - out of the hadronic system . at the time of freeze - out many hadrons scatter and",
    "coalesce into compound or excited states(see figure 2 ) .",
    "the dibaryon state interacts in three two - body scattering channels .",
    "its mass is 2.15 gev and has a strong interaction resonance decay width of 100 mev .",
    "it interacts in the @xmath7 @xmath7 d - wave spin anti - aligned@xcite , @xmath6 @xmath2 p - wave spin aligned@xcite , and @xmath8 @xmath7 s - wave spin aligned@xcite .",
    "the dibaryon system mainly resonates in the s - wave @xmath8 @xmath7 mode with a pion rotating in a p - wave about a spin aligned @xmath7 @xmath7 system which forms a isospin singlet .",
    "the pion moves back and forth forming @xmath8 states with one nucleon and then the other(see figure 3 ) .",
    "all three isospin states of the pion can be achieved in this resonance .",
    "thus we can have @xmath9 @xmath6 , @xmath10 @xmath6 , and @xmath11 @xmath6 states . if the pion is absorbed by any of the nucleons it under goes a spin flip producing a d - wave @xmath7 @xmath7 system .",
    "the resonance decays into @xmath7 @xmath7 , @xmath2 @xmath6 , or @xmath2 @xmath7 @xmath7 . in a meson system an analogous resonance is formed where a pion is orbiting in a p - wave about a @xmath12 in a s - wave@xcite(see figure 4 ) .",
    "both systems have a similar lifetime or width of @xmath13 .100 gev .    in order to predict the rate for dibaryon production we turn to a monte carlo heavy ion event generator@xcite .",
    "this generator was a cradle to grave going from initial partons to final state hadrons .",
    "figure 5 shows the time line in the center - of - mass frame for partons , then pre - hadrons and final hadrons .",
    "what is happening in the early times of the collision is of no importance for dibaryon formation , while the conditions of the hadrons at later times will determine the dibaryon production . for @xmath4=200 gev central au+au collisions the spectrum is well measured .",
    "therefore we can start the monte carlo at the intermediate times with a fireball of excited hadrons and let it evolve to the final state .",
    "we start with an expanding cylinder of radius 10.0 fermi filled with excited hadrons with density and @xmath14 distribution that reproduces the @xmath4=200 gev central au+au collisions .",
    "figure 6 gives the measured au+au spectrum which we will tune for .",
    "mesons in the fireball cascade include @xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath33 and @xmath34 was determined from s - matrix phase shifts , while for @xmath35 we used the production of @xmath21 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27,and @xmath32(see figure 7 ) . for @xmath36",
    "cross sections we used the production of @xmath28 , @xmath37 , and @xmath27 , while for @xmath38 we used the production of @xmath23 . for @xmath39 we used @xmath29 and @xmath30(see figure 8) .",
    "finally for @xmath40 we used @xmath31 and @xmath41 we used @xmath25 and @xmath27 . for all other meson meson cross section we used the additive quark model .",
    "the particles produced from such scatterings were determined by a multi - pomeron chain model using a field - feymann algorithm(see figure 9 ) .",
    "since we are detecting baryons and anti - baryons the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 cross section and scattering ratios are obtained from data and extracted s - matrix amplitudes(see figure 10 ) . all other cross sections for baryon meson and baryon baryon systems we use the additive quark model(see figure 11 ) .",
    "the particles produced from such scatterings are determined by a multi - pomeron chain model using a field - feymann algorithm . for baryon(@xmath46 ) anti - baryon(@xmath47 ) scattering and cross section , data is used for @xmath48 annihilation and elastic scattering . for annihilation yields ,",
    "we use a flavor consistent meson meson multi - pomeron chain model .",
    "for the rest of the yield a @xmath49 multi - pomeron chain model is used .",
    "the elastic scattering obtained by this method is close to the data for the @xmath48 system .",
    "the annihilation threshold effect is scaled to other @xmath49 scatterings using the @xmath48 ratios obtained in the above algorithm .",
    "we need to add the production of d s into the monte carlo code .",
    "let us assume that the formation of the @xmath50 dibaryon state is the driving source of d s .",
    "we fit the d - wave @xmath42 elastic scattering@xcite , p - wave @xmath51 elastic scattering@xcite , and p - wave @xmath51 to d - wave @xmath42@xcite .",
    "a three channel k - matrix was used to form a s - matrix , where the channels are d - wave @xmath42 , p - wave @xmath51 , and s - wave @xmath45 data .",
    "we are able to fit the above data if we use one k - matrix pole to generate the dibaryon 2.15 gev state plus a far away pole and a flat none factorable background .",
    "figure 12 shows the fit to elastic @xmath42 scattering amplitude .",
    "figure 13 shows the fit to @xmath51 elastic scattering , while figure 14 is the connection between @xmath42 going to @xmath51 .    the cross sections for @xmath7 @xmath7 @xmath52 @xmath2 @xmath6 , @xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath52 @xmath2 @xmath6 , @xmath2 @xmath6 @xmath52 @xmath8 @xmath7 and @xmath7 @xmath7 where added to the hadron cascade part of the code .",
    "when we consider the known cross sections for @xmath42 and @xmath45 , the yield for charge pairs of @xmath51 can be calculated and is plotted in figure 15 . in our hadron cascade",
    "these scatterings are the only source of d s .",
    "the production of d s and anti - d s is close to the values measured in figure 1",
    ". the value of d s in the cascade would be much larger than the measured value except d s are destroyed by interacting with pions .",
    "figure 16 show the large @xmath51 cross section of @xmath13 250 mb .",
    "about 3/4 of these scattering remove the d s from the cascade .",
    "we achieve the yield and spectrum for au+au @xmath4=200 gev central collisions by adjusting the excited hadrons in our cylinder of radius 10.0 fermi .",
    "we generate enough events at @xmath4=200 gev central au+au collisions in order to obtain 1 million @xmath6 or @xmath53 events in the star acceptance .",
    "out of the 1 million events there were 230,000 pairs of either @xmath6 @xmath2 or @xmath53 @xmath2 which decayed in the star acceptance . the effective mass distribution of these pairs are plotted as solid points in figure 17 .    in order to obtain the mass spectrum from the data , we need to determined the uncorrelated background of either @xmath6 or @xmath53 paired with a charge particle in a average event .",
    "for each of the 1 million events we can pair up either the @xmath6 or @xmath53 with all charge particles(which then is assumed to be a pion ) in that event and plot the total number of pairs as a function of effective mass . from this pair spectrum",
    "we then subtract the average uncorrelated spectrum times the number of events .",
    "we can determine this average uncorrelated spectrum by mixed event methods taking the same @xmath6 and @xmath53 paired with the charged particles from other events .",
    "the subtracted effective mass spectrum is the open points of figure 17 .",
    "we see that we have recovered the mass spectrum .",
    "in the first section of this manuscript we consider baryons and anti - baryons up to a baryon number five .",
    "these states decayed by the weak interaction .",
    "the exotic states that decay strongly is considered in the second section . in order to develop methods for such research we consider a dibaryon(2.15 ) @xmath0 = @xmath1 state which decays into d @xmath2 .",
    "we create a monte carlo simulation that should give realistic events structure with realistic dibaryon production . with the ability to measure hundreds of million ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions",
