    "the response of a periodic system to stimuli can be characterized by measuring the phase shift occurring as a result of a stimulus , i.e. by quantifying the difference between the collective phases of the perturbed and the original system .",
    "the phase shift s dependence on the phase value at which the perturbation occurred is termed _ phase resetting curve _ ( or phase response curve , prc ) , and is an inherent characteristic of any oscillatory system  @xcite . study and applications of prcs are currently receiving a growing attention through their theoretical and experimental aspects  @xcite .",
    "periodic biological systems are often composed of many interacting units , whose collective behavior emerges from the dynamical properties of the single units  @xcite .",
    "the collective ( macroscopic ) phase response of an empirical oscillator is generated from stimuli that act on the level of individual ( microscopic ) units , and composed of their individual phase responses .    in the context of neural oscillations",
    "various methods have been developed for the empirical measurement of prcs , both _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro_. the methods depend on the type / size of the neural ensemble , and are typically involving electric stimulation of neurons that induce a measurable phase shift in their spiking behavior  @xcite .",
    "recently , the epileptiform activity in rats was characterized through experimental prcs , obtained by stimulating thalamus and cortex of epileptic animals during spike and wave seizures  @xcite .",
    "investigation of prcs is relevant for understanding the interaction properties of the neural networks , such as their stability  @xcite , or synchronization and clustering  @xcite .",
    "the assumption of weak inter - neuron coupling was experimentally tested via infinitesimal prcs  @xcite .",
    "a new technique of prc construction from data , based on weighted spike - triggered averaging was recently proposed  @xcite . while mostly studied in the domain of neurons , prcs",
    "are also explored in other natural rhythmic systems , that can be modeled as ensembles of many oscillatory elements .",
    "empirical and theoretical examination was thus conducted in coupled circadian clocks of insects  @xcite , and the periodically driven saline oscillator  @xcite .    due to its global periodic behavior ,",
    "dynamics of neurons / oscillators and the resulting prcs can be easily studied analytically or modeled computationally  @xcite . on the level of few neurons , extensive analytical results including bifurcation diagrams are available for various neuron models and types of interaction  @xcite . on the other hand , global cooperative behavior in large neuron ensembles",
    "is typically examined numerically by modeling single elements as simple phase - oscillators . in this context , kuramoto - type oscillators  @xcite",
    "are usually employed for their elegant and useful synchronization properties  @xcite , that are well understood for various topologically and structurally different networks  @xcite .",
    "a recent study of the phase response of stochastic oscillators revealed the interplay between microscopic and macroscopic collective phase sensitivity , for ensembles of globally coupled  @xcite , and network coupled elements  @xcite .",
    "phase resetting in globally coupled ensembles of oscillators was investigated in relation to the symmetry properties of the coupling function  @xcite , emphasizing the peculiarity of non - odd coupling functional forms .",

    "phase response behavior of complex oscillator networks , besides giving insights into their interaction patterns  @xcite , can also assist in revealing the details of their network connectivity  @xcite .",
    "while the prcs of a single ( or few ) oscillators are very well understood  @xcite , the results for ensembles of oscillators are still rather scarce and often limited to numerical investigations only  @xcite .",
    "namely , the difficulty here is that there are two contributions to the phase resetting .",
    "apart from the phase shift immediately caused by the perturbation , the relaxation of the ensemble into a stationary state may induce an additional ( potentially significant ) phase shift , since any finite stimulus in general perturbs the system out of its equilibrium .",
    "in this paper we consider a globally coupled ensemble of sakaguchi - kuramoto oscillators  @xcite , interacting via a non - odd coupling function .",
    "the system is perturbed from its dynamical equilibrium by applying the kick ( of controllable form and strength ) to the individual oscillators .",
    "we employ the watanabe - strogatz ansatz  @xcite in the recently proposed ott - antonsen ( oa ) formulation  @xcite , and calculate analytically the effect of the relaxation of system s collective phase .",
    "as we show , an additional phase reset is induced , and its properties can be obtained from the ensemble s state measured immediately after the perturbation .",
    "we confirm our theoretical results through a series of numerical simulations , considering both identical and non - identical oscillators .",
    "the extent of our theory is illustrated by considering the phase - resetting in an ensemble of stuart - landau oscillators .    in opposition to  @xcite , here we consider deterministic oscillators and perturbations of arbitrary strength ( not infinitesimal ) , thus allowing the exploration of the phase reset s time evolution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec - formulation ] we formulate our model of kicked oscillator ensemble , define the concept of phase resetting and describe our implementation of perturbation . in section  [ sec - analyticalz0 ] we show some analytical results regarding calculation of the immediate prc . in section  [ sec - time - evolution ]",

    "eq - oamanifold , but using @xmath194 instead of @xmath195 .",
    "namely , the kick of a strength @xmath196 described by the equations above produces different shift in the collective phase , roughly five times smaller than a kick of strength @xmath195 given by eq .",
    "eq - kickjump ( since it affects both @xmath24 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "nevertheless , there is a good agreement between numerical and analytical curves , despite having considered a completely different ( complex , i.e. two - dimensional ) class of oscillators .",
    "this suggests that the range of application of both oa theory and our phase - resetting theory extends beyond simple phase - oscillators .",
    "we constructed a theory of the phase resetting of the collective phase for ensembles of sakaguchi - kuramoto oscillators interacting globally via a non - odd coupling function . by employing the ott - antonsen theory we showed that the final phase resetting curve can be recovered from the collective system s state @xmath86 , measured immediately after the perturbation .",
    "we confirmed our theory on a series of numerical examples involving small and large ensembles of identical and non - identical oscillators , using various kicking patterns and strengths .",
    "in particular , we showed an example where the entire prc - problem was solved analytically ( eq .  eq - walphasolution ) .",
    "finally , by investigating prc of an ensemble of stuart - landau oscillators , we showed that our theory is valid beyond phase - oscillator models .",
    "* _ numerically _ , from ( a long ) run ( dark / blue symbols in figs .  [ fig-3]-[fig-7 ] ) , * _ analytically _ , by calculating the curve @xmath56 using eqs.eq-defiprc&eq-deltar ( full thick curve in figs .  [ fig-3]-[fig-7 ] ) , * _ semi - analytically _ , by applying the eq .",
    "eq - deltar to the numerically obtained curves @xmath55 and @xmath146 ( squares in fig .  [ fig-4 ] ) .",
    "our findings suggest that the system s relaxation after the perturbation can significantly alter its final prc . in agreement with  @xcite",
    ", we found that the initial and the final phase resets coincide for odd interaction functions ( @xmath149 ) or perturbations that leave the collective state unchanged ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "however , once the collective radius @xmath145 is perturbed , different rotation speeds of the collective phases of the original and kicked systems ( proportional to @xmath198 ) induce an additional non - trivial phase reset at the limit .",
    "it is worth noticing the case of @xmath199 : here our theory no longer holds , since the mean field is zero @xmath200 , and therefore the collective phase is not well defined .",
    "this renders impossible to generally define the concept of phase - resetting .",
    "however , in this case the kick transiently induces @xmath201 contrasting the disordered behavior for @xmath200  this situation can perhaps be used to model the dynamical behavior underlying the appearance of event related potentials , which are of great current interest in neuroscience and psychology  @xcite .",
    "our theory is valid for arbitrary sakaguchi - kuramoto - type ensembles of identical oscillators ( e.g. , a nonlinear coupling  @xcite can be easily incorporated ) , and ensembles of non - identical oscillators with lorentzian frequency distribution .",
    "its limitations are in principle given by the range of validity of oa theory  @xcite ; nevertheless , our numerical results indicate that our analytical findings apply even for conditions that are formally not included in the oa theory , such as small ensembles ( far from thermodynamic limit )",
    ".    an important extension of our results regards the generalization on complex networks .",
    "a general network connection topology will generate a more complicated post - kick time evolution of the collective phase , which is not covered by the oa theory .",
    "understanding evolution of the phase reset on complex networks is of high relevance for problems related to the reconstruction of the network structure from the experimental data . by investigating the properties of the empirical prcs",
    ", one might be able to recover the connectivity patterns of the underlying network  @xcite .",
    "another relevant question revolves around the stochastic periodic systems , and different methods of defining their prcs  @xcite .",
    "a complete theory of stochastic prcs will be of great help in constructing the prc from periodic ( but noisy ) experimental data . finally ,",
    "since a prc can be generally defined for any rhythmic system , our results can be extended to other types / models of oscillators , such as different models of neural cells .",
