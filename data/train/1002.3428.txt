    "the rising blue continuum is consistent with an origin in the rayleigh - jeans tail of cyclotron emission ; a similar conclusion was reached by harrop - allin et al .",
    "however , the rising continuum is also consistent with the spectral energy distribution in this region for k and early m stars .",
    "we clearly detect secondary star features as absorption lines due to na i , ca i , and mg i. figure 4 compares our ir spectrum to single star templates covering k0v to m0v with a best fit ( based on line ratios ) of k6-k8 .",

    "ss aur is one of the rare dn which have relatively normal co.    the @xmath0-band spectrum shown in figure 5 is consistent with solar abundances in that the line ratios agree with our m4v template while the bluer slope herolds the the presence of a hot white dwarf and accretion disk in the ss aur system .",
    "according to aavso records our spectrum was obtained in quiescence , 10 - 12 days prior to a normal outburst .",

    "our ir spectrum reveals no evidence for this behavior , however that is completely expected as chromospheric activity does not manifest itself in the higher energy hydrogen lines due to their formation deep in the stellar photosphere ( see  4.2 , howell et al . , 2006 ) .",

    ", this velocity width would be expected to be near 200 km / sec , essentially at our spectral resolution but in agreement with the single - peaked line we see .",
    "our @xmath0-band spectrum has moderate s / n in the continuum but no explicit absorption features from the secondary star are detected .",
    "however it does seem that the co band ( + water vapor ) continuum break , present in m8 - 9 stars and l type brown dwarfs ( see kendall et al .",
    "2004 ) , may be marginally detected starting at 2.29 microns and extending redward .",
    "given the strength of the white dwarf continuum ( szkody et al .",
    "have shown that the uv and optical continua are dominated by the wd ) and some accretion disk contribution ( based on the presence of emission lines and the low inclination ) we are not surprised at the lack of secondary star absorption features .",
    "if we are detecting the co continuum break , our best fit donor star would be of spectral type later then m9 v having a mass of less than 0.06 m@xmath16 .",
    "szkody et al . , ( 2002 ) determined a mass of 0.8 m@xmath16 for the pulsating white dwarf in gw lib from fitting the hst spectrum with a dual temperature white dwarf model .",
    "taking k1=40 km / sec , as found by szkody et al . and thorstensen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from optical spectroscopy and our mass limit above , @xmath17 @xmath180.075 and the k2 velocity amplitude would be near 500 km / sec .",
    "our sample of pre- and present day cvs , both with magnetic and non - magnetic white dwarfs , was obtained in order to provide a more coherent picture of the presence or absence of co absorption in the ir spectra of these stars .",
    "harrison et al . ( 2004,2005 ) set the stage by showing the apparent presence of normal co absorption in polars and the apparent lack of or weak co absorption ( but the presence of o ) in dwarf novae .",
    "taking this information , it has been suggested that the secondary stars in dwarf novae are highly evolved cno burners , while those in polars are younger main sequence stars of near solar abundance .",
    "this scenario requires a different evolution for pre - cvs which become dwarf novae as compared to pre - cvs that become polars - the latter group being essentially unknown ( liebert et al .",
    "the results presented here appear to add further confusion to the issue of the evolutionary path of cvs .",
    "we find that the polar v1309 ori has extremely weak co features , in contrast to the result for all other polars ( harrison et al .",
    "2005 ) , while the secondary in the mainstream non - magnetic cv , ss aur , appears to have normal co features .",
    "both of these objects have a few characteristics that set them apart from other members of their respective classes , but they certainly do not show any behavior that is not seen in other members of their classes .",
    "we confirm the suggestion by dhillon et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that there is no evidence for enhanced 13co absorption in v471 tau .",
    "thus , none of the so - called pre - cvs presented here , or elsewhere , show any sign of abundance peculiarities .",
    "the objects observed in this study are listed in table 2 and our former @xmath0-band studies in the literature are listed in table 3 . taken together , these observations seem to cloud the issue of co absorption as we find that all the pre - cvs , which all have non - magnetic white dwarfs and are thought to evolve into dwarf novae , show apparent normal abundances including co absorption .",
    "we also find that the supposedly hibernating cv , qs vir , shows normal co absorption as well .",
    "in addition , one polar ( v1309 ori ) , does not show co absorption but has the somewhat non - typical polar properties of a very long orbital period and a subgiant secondary .",
    "there is no single theory to reconcile these results that does nt strain credulity .",
    "if magnetic and non - magnetic cv evolution is identical , then we must ignore the growing evidence from uv and ir observations that there appear to be abundance issues in non - magnetic cv systems .",
    "this requires us to find a method to preferentially obscure the co features in the secondary star of disk - accreting systems ( co emission from the accretion disk ? ) , and ( simultaneously ) excite nitrogen emission over that of carbon . or we must come up with a method that strongly enhances n , and depletes c , between the pre - cv phase and contact , that _ only _ occurs in disk - accreting cvs .",
    "this also relegates some subset of cvs , including u gem , wz sge , vy aqr , v1309 ori , ae aqr , gk per , ch uma , and perhaps even ss cyg ( robinson & bitner 2009 ) and ru peg , to the `` oddball '' bin .",
    "the idea of actual low c abundance would likely mean that some of the secondary stars follow a different evolution to become a cv with a seemingly high dependence on their white dwarf s magnetic properties .",
    "another possibility is that some of the present day cvs we observe are simply systems which contain older secondary stars , stars that are highly evolved nearing or just past their main sequence lifetime .",
    "if this latter idea is true , then it implies that essentially all polars are younger systems and any containing evolved secondaries are essentially unknown or observationally selected against .",
    "additionally , the present sample of pre - cvs seems not to contain any evolved stars soon to be cv donors . we could try to accept that pre - cvs secondaries go through an extremely rapid evolution including cno burning between the present epoch and their becoming a dwarf novae or that all the present day pre - cvs will not actually end up as dwarf novae . but both of these scenarios seem highly ad hoc .",
    "it may be that the entire binary undergoes a different evolutionary path depending on the formation of a magnetic or non - magnetic wd ( tout et al . , 2008 ) with some non - magnetic systems taking longer until contact allowing some donors to evolve .",
    "another scenario for low c abundance may be that the secondary star collects cno processed material from the white dwarf during dn outbursts and this material covers and hides the normal abundance photosphere providing us with a view showing an apparent lack of co. this idea has many flaws , not the least of which are the amazingly small solid angle the secondary subtends in which to receive most of the material , the problem that this material would have to spread to cover the entire secondary star surface , and the fact that a convective atmosphere will mix the material into the star s interior very fast , a few tens of minutes ( kawaler 2008 , priv .",
    "comm ) .    exploring another option , howell et al .",
    "( 2004 ) noted that wz sge , a non - magnetic cv , shows co _ emission _ in its @xmath0-band spectrum . the most likely formation site for the co emission was in the outer cool dense regions of the accretion disk .",
    "these regions are dense and cool enough to shield the co molecules from the uv emission able to disassociate them .",
    "furthermore , howell et al . (",
    "2008 ) found that the outer accretion disk regions in wz sge were indeed very cool , cool enough for dust to form .",
    "the common property linking many of the cvs which show no or weak co absorption is the fact that they have accretion disks  most of those without accretions disks show normal co absorption .",
    "qs vir may be the most interesting .",
    "it is supposed to be a hibernating non - magnetic cv , thus it was a dn with an accretion disk and will be again , yet it has a normal looking secondary star including co absorption .    can co emission from the accretion disk fill in the secondary star co absorption and account for the weak or missing lines ? to see if this might work , we choose to model the dwarf nova u gem which is noted to have very weak to no co absorption present in its @xmath0-band spectrum ( harrison et al . , 2005b ) .",
    "we produced an artificial co emission spectrum , and using the fact that the br@xmath2 disk emission line in u gem has a fwhm velocity of @xmath11750 km / s , we broadened our model co emission by 1500 km / s so as to approximate a more  distant \" emission region ( i.e. , the outer disk ) .",
    "we next took an m4v template spectrum ( the spectral type of the secondary star in u gem ) and summed it with our co emission model .",
    "the m4v template spectrum we used is shown at the bottom of the plot .",
    "it has a velocity broadening of 90 km / s applied to get it to look more or less like the observed secondary star features present in the u gem spectrum .",
    "we normalized the first overtone of the co emission spectrum to exactly match the absolute depth of the co overtone absorption band in the template spectrum to make a best attempt to `` fill - in '' the co absorption spectrum .",
    "we then replaced the red end ( redward of 2.28 microns ) of the u gem @xmath0-band spectrum ( orbital phase 0.20 ) with our summed model scaled to match the observed continuum at 2.28 microns ( figure 11 ) .",
    "while we did not produce a full disk model spectrum with added co emission , this exercise was intended to illustrate whether co emission could fill - in or hide the expected m star molecular absorption .",
    "the spectrum labeled  100% \" in fig .",
    "11 is our initial model as just described while the one labeled ",
    "50% \" is the same process but with the co overtone emission at only 50% of its initial strength .",
    "we note that in the 100% case , the narrow co absorption features create troughs at the emission line peaks ( similar to the hi lines in gk per and ss cyg as shown in fig .",
    "10 of harrison et al . ,",
    "2009 ) . even in the",
    " 50% \" spectrum is choppy with emission humps on both sides of each of the narrower co absorption features .",
    "however , when the s / n of the red continuum is poor , this choppiness may not be noticeable as in , for example , the spectrum presented here for rz leo and other fainter dn with @xmath0-band spectra in the literature .",
    "if co emission from the accretion disk is the cause of the weak or absent secondary star co absorption then why do not the systems where the @xmath0-band spectra are completely dominated by disk emission show co emission ? only wz",
    "sge has shown clear co emission and we noted earlier that this same star is also the only cv which is carbon rich .",
    "the cv systems where the disk flux dominates the @xmath0-band ( i.e. , no secondary star seen ) are ones with high mass transfer rates and hot accretion disks , perhaps too hot to contain cool regions able to form co. or they are low inclination systems where the hot inner disk and white dwarf continuum light outshine the remaining disk ( including any co emission present ) .    there are some non - magnetic cvs which show weak or normal co absorption strengths yet also have accretion disks .",
    "we could try to make arguments such as in rz leo we see only weak co absorption perhaps related to its high inclination ( @xmath15=65 degrees ) or its low mass transfer rate .",
    "ss aur , on the other hand , has a moderate inclination ( @xmath15=38 degrees ) but contains a hot ( 30,000k ) wd .",
    "perhaps this hot star provides sufficient uv flux so as to not allow co to form in the disk .",
    "maybe the carbon abundance is just not high enough to produce co emission in the accretion disk ?",
    "do accretion disks _ know _ how to make just enough co emission to fill - in the secondary stars co absorption in the  no \" cases and just too little in the weak cases ?",
    "why is wz sge so far the only disk system to show co emission ?",
    "does the lack of co absorption in a dn remain constant over the orbit and over time ?",
    "all good questions without good answers .    based on weak co absorption , parallaxes , and other abundance anomalies , harrison et al .",
    "( 2004a ) have argued that the cvs ss cyg , ru peg ae aqr , and gk per contain subgiant secondary stars .",
    "we show in this paper that the long - period polar v1309 ori is likely to contain a subgiant secondary as well .",
    "binary evolution models of cvs ( e.g. , howell et al . , 2001 ) show that systems in the range of about 3 to 5 hours have bloated secondary stars , that is their secondaries are too large for their mass compared to main sequence models .",
    "this fact may make some secondaries appear to be subgiants but can not alone explain the weakness of co absorption , 13co , or other anomalies in the spectra .",
    "beuermann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) explored evolutionary scenarios in which the secondary stars had undergone nuclear evolution prior to mass transfer leading to the suggestion that many long period cvs should have evolved donor stars .",
    "barraffe and kolb ( 2000 ) have shown that some observational properties of cvs above the period gap can be explained if evolutionary models include secondary stars which have some h depletion in their core , including secondaries which are substantially evolved off the main sequence ( i.e. , subgiants ) .",
    "detailed abundance studies of cv secondaries , while a difficult observational task , is needed to place any of these arguments on a firm foundation .",
    "the reality is that we do not know the exact mechanism by which co emission could be produced in the accretion disks or in what fraction of disks it might be produced .",
    "some cvs show evidence in both the uv ( high n / c ratios ) and the @xmath0-band ( weak or absent co ) to suggest that the secondary stars are highly evolved .",
    "our sample of 24 disk systems discussed here does not provide any consistent clues to settle the discussion .",
    "perhaps a variety of mechanisms are operating simultaneously within the binary systems . to date",
    ", there does not seem to be a single answer which can account for all the observations regarding the weak or absent co absorption in the secondary stars of cataclysmic variables .",
