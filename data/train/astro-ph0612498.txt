    "our ellipse must be understood as an average model of the knots traced by deconvolution and this picture shows the good consistency of both techniques.,height=170 ]    the application of a model ( containing _ a priori _ information on the source ) allows to extrapolate high - spatial frequency visibilities from the low spatial frequency ones and then to estimate structures smaller than the diffraction limit ( @xmath2  320  mas at 12.8  @xmath0 m ) . in this way , the model accounting for the _ visir visibilities _ considers two main contributions to the mir flux : ( i ) a small component of @xmath3  85  mas , well below the diffraction limit and in full agreement with the sizes of the dusty torus from @xcite and @xcite ; ( ii ) a ns elongated one at p.a .",
