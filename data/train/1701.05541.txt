    "among the giant planets , saturn and uranus lack a significant present - day population of small bodies subjected to their respective 1:1 mean motion or co - orbital resonances ( quasi - satellite , trojan , horseshoe or combinations of these three elementary resonant states ) .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of trojans or minor bodies librating 60 ahead ( l@xmath2 lagrangian point ) or behind ( l@xmath4 ) a host planet in its orbit .",
    "trojans describe a shifting path in the shape of a tadpole around the associated lagrangian point when seen in a frame of reference centred at the sun and rotating with the host planet ( for further details , see e.g. murray & dermott 1999 ) .",

    "2011 ; nesvorn , vokrouhlick & morbidelli 2013 ) and neptune may have a similarly large population including both primordial or long - term stable trojans ( e.g. kortenkamp , malhotra & michtchenko 2004 ; nesvorn & vokrouhlick 2009 ; sheppard & trujillo 2006 , 2010 ) and transient or recently captured ones ( e.g. de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2012b , c ) .",
    "in contrast to the cases of jupiter and neptune , any existing trojans of saturn still remain to be detected and the first trojan of uranus a transient one , 2011  qf@xmath0 was announced in 2013 ( alexandersen et al .",

    "asteroid 2011  qf@xmath0 could be a former member of the centaur population and it may return to it after being scattered away at the end of its current co - orbital episode .",
    "the present - day dynamical status as uranian trojan of 2011  qf@xmath0 was further confirmed by de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2014 ) who showed that a three - body mean motion resonance is responsible for both its insertion into uranus co - orbital region and its eventual escape from there .",
    "the critical role of three - body resonances as source of instability for uranian trojans was first discussed by marzari , tricarico & scholl ( 2003 ) . here , we identify a second trojan of uranus , 2014  yx@xmath1 , and explore numerically its past , current and future dynamical evolution .",

    "if the analysis in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2015 ) showed that there is enough theoretical ground to assume that a population of high orbital inclination uranian co - orbitals may exist , the identification of this trojan shows that there are also robust observational grounds , adding more weight to the hypothesis . both 2014  yx@xmath1 and 472651 are comparatively large and bright",
    ", making them easier to detect ; finding any fainter , hypothetical bodies moving in somewhat similar orbits may require a carefully planned survey though .",
    "dvorak , bazs & zhou ( 2010 ) investigated the stability of putative primordial uranus trojans and found stable islands at the inclination intervals ( 0 , 7 ) , ( 9 , 13 ) , ( 31 , 36)and ( 38 , 50 ) .",
    "asteroid 2011  qf@xmath0 , the first uranian trojan , inhabits one of these stable areas as its current value of the orbital inclination is nearly 11 ; however , this object is not a primordial uranus trojan ( alexandersen et al . 2013b ; de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 ) .",
    "in contrast , 2014  yx@xmath1 currently occupies ( see fig .",
    "[ controlyx49 ] , e - panels ) an unstable region between two of the stable islands described in dvorak et al .",
    "( 2010 ) as its current value of the inclination is nearly 26 .",
    "in addition , its inclination remains in the range 2027 for most of the studied time .",
    "however , our analysis shows that even if 2014  yx@xmath1 is less dynamically stable than 2011  qf@xmath0 , it can still remain as transient trojan of uranus for a relatively long period of time .",
    "the situation is similar to that of 472651 , although this object moves in a higher inclination orbit .",
    "our results provide additional confirmation that overlapping mean motion resonances can trigger transitions between co - orbital states and also deliver minor bodies inside the co - orbital zone of a planetary body as well as evict them from there .",
    "the duration of these episodes is short , typically 1020  kyr in the cases of captures as co - orbitals or ejections from the co - orbital zone , and about 5  kyr when inducing transitions between the various co - orbital states ( see figs [ examples ] and [ transition ] ) .",
    "the dynamical effects of three - body mean motion resonances have been studied recently by gallardo ( 2014 ) .",
    "in this paper , we provide a detailed exploration of the past , present and future orbital evolution of 2014  yx@xmath1 , the second trojan of uranus .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "a.   asteroid 2014  yx@xmath1 is a transient l@xmath2 trojan of uranus , the second minor body to be confirmed as currently engaged in this type of resonant state .",
    "its current libration period is over 5100  yr .",
    "b.   although 2014  yx@xmath1 may have remained in its current trojan state for about 60  kyr , it can continue doing so for another 80  kyr .",
    "our calculations suggest that it may stay within uranus co - orbital zone for nearly 1  myr .",
    "c.   in addition to being a uranian trojan , 2014  yx@xmath1 is currently trapped in the 7:20 mean motion resonance with saturn ; therefore , this minor body is currently subjected to a three - body resonance .",
    "it is also engaged in a long - term secular resonance with neptune .",
    "d.   the dynamical mechanism behind the insertion of 2014  yx@xmath1 in uranus co - orbital zone involves a brief episode of concurrent resonant behaviour with jupiter ( 1:7 ) and neptune ( 2:1 ) .",
    "a virtually identical mechanism is also responsible for scattering 2014  yx@xmath1 away from the 1:1 commensurability with uranus .",
    "e.   transitions between the various states within the 1:1 mean motion resonance with uranus are mainly triggered by ephemeral resonant episodes with jupiter .",
    "f.   our analysis shows that 2014  yx@xmath1 shares a number of dynamical characteristics with ( 472651 ) 2015  db@xmath17 , another uranian co - orbital that follows a relatively high - inclination orbit .",
    "as these two objects are comparatively rather bright / large , the presence of fainter / smaller minor bodies following somewhat similar paths is highly probable and this plausible conjecture lends credibility to the idea that a population of temporary uranian co - orbitals may exist at relatively high orbital inclinations .    our investigation of the dynamics of 2011  qf@xmath0",
    ", 472651 and 2014  yx@xmath1 shows that ephemeral multibody mean motion resonance episodes are behind the events that lead to the capture and ejection of transient uranian co - orbitals .",
    "this general mechanism may have also played some role in the loss of any putative primordial uranus trojans early in the history of the solar system .",
