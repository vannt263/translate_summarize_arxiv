    "that upper bound implies that    @xmath31    for @xmath32 , and    @xmath33    for @xmath34 .",
    "it also implies that every graph with more than @xmath35 edges has fewer than @xmath2 cycles . the graph @xmath36 ( the cycle of length @xmath0 with every edge doubled ) is @xmath4-regular , and has therefore @xmath37 edges , and has precisely @xmath38 cycles .",
    "this shows that we can not omit the @xmath39 term above .",

    "this problem was raised by entringer and slater @xcite who observed that no connected graph @xmath10 can have more than @xmath15 cycles .",
    "this follows from the trivial upper bound because there is a binary @xmath63 $ ] code @xmath11 called the _ cycle code _ of the graph .",
    "its codewords are defined on the edge set and are the indicator vectors of the edge disjoint unions of cycles .",
    "the minimal codewords of @xmath11 are the indicator vectors of the cycles of @xmath10 .",
    "entringer and slater @xcite also observed that there are graphs having slightly more than @xmath2 cycles and asked if this is ( essentially ) the maximum .",
    "finally , entringer and slater @xcite observed that the maximum is attained for cubic graphs .",
    "the first bound significantly below the trivial bound was obtained by aldred and thomassen @xcite who proved that no connected graph @xmath10 can have more than @xmath64 cycles .",
    "this is the best known upper bound for cubic graphs .",
    "but , for graphs of average degree @xmath65 there are better bounds , and in fact , the question by entringer and slater has been answered for all graphs of average degree slightly greater than @xmath4 .",
    "the agrell bound ( theorem 2 ) immediately implies the following .",
    "if @xmath10 is a connected graph on @xmath0 vertices and with @xmath1 edges satisfying @xmath66 , then its number of cycles is at most @xmath67    we shall prove the following .    if @xmath10 is a connected graph on @xmath0 vertices and with @xmath1 edges , and we write @xmath68    where @xmath69 are nonnegative integers , and @xmath70    then its number of cycles is at most @xmath71    if we fix the ratio @xmath72 and let @xmath0 tend to infinity , then the bounds in corollary 1 and theorem 2 are essentially exponential functions .",
    "the exponential function in theorem 2 is in a sense best possible , as we point out below . also , both results answer the question of entringer and slater ( asking if a graph can have significantly more than @xmath2 cycles ) for graphs of average degree slightly more than @xmath4 . corollary 1",
    "shows that counterexamples ( if any ) can have at most @xmath73 edges .",
    "theorem 2 goes further and says that they must have at most @xmath35 edges",
    ". it would be interesting to answer the question for all graphs of average degree at least 4 .",
    "theorem 2 is a consequence of theorem 3 below .",
    "a * path * is a graph with vertices @xmath74 and edges @xmath75 a * multipath * is obtained from a path by replacing some edges with multiple edges .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the maximal number of paths from @xmath77 to @xmath78 in a multipath with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 edges .",
    "this maximum is attained if no two edge multiplicities differ by more than @xmath79 .",
    "so , if @xmath80 divides @xmath1 , then    @xmath81    if @xmath82",

    "so @xmath10 has at most @xmath92 paths from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "as @xmath89 is the number of paths between the ends in a multipath with @xmath80 vertices and @xmath93 edges , we may interprete @xmath92 as the number of paths between the ends in a multipath with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 edges , where the first edge multiplicity in the multipath is @xmath42 . by the maximum property of @xmath76",

    "* proof : *    by the definition of @xmath95 , there exists a multipath with @xmath0 vertices , @xmath96 edges , and precisely @xmath97 paths between the ends .",
    "if we add an edge between the ends we get a graph with @xmath0 vertices , @xmath1 edges , and at least @xmath97 cycles .    to prove the last statement , consider any edge @xmath98 in @xmath10 .",
    "the number of cycles in @xmath10 containing @xmath99 is the number of paths in @xmath100 from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . by lemma 1 ,",
    "this number is at most @xmath101    this completes the proof .    because of the logarithm in the definition of @xmath102 , theorem 3 gives the right @xmath102-value for the graphs of a fixed average degree .",
    "it is still interesting , though , to decide if the bound @xmath103 can be lowered to about @xmath104 .",
    "does the maximum number of cycles occur in graphs similar to @xmath105 ? are there graphs of average degree @xmath106 without multiple edges that have the same number or a larger number of cycles ?",
    "these questions are open even for cubic graphs .",
    "as mentioned earlier , entringer and slater @xcite observed that a cubic graph on @xmath0 vertices may have as many as @xmath107 cycles .",
    "it has been open for several years if this is close to the right number . for planar cubic graphs",
    "this was verified by aldred and thomassen @xcite . for general cubic graphs they lowered the trivial upper bound @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "we can now answer the question by entringer and slater @xcite for all graphs with average degree slightly more than @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a graph with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 edges . if @xmath110 , then @xmath10 has at most @xmath2 cycles .    * proof:*consider first the case where @xmath111 .",
    "the upper bound on the number of cycles provided by theorem 2 is @xmath112 , which is more than @xmath113 .",

    "this number is @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we can now determine @xmath118 completely .    for @xmath119 @xmath120",
    "if @xmath18 is of the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 is a natural number @xmath123 , then @xmath124    the function @xmath118 is continuous and linear in each closed interval from @xmath121 to @xmath125 , where @xmath122 is a natural number @xmath123 .",
    "* proof : *    assume first that @xmath126 .",
    "for any two natural numbers @xmath127 we let @xmath128 be obtained from @xmath36 by subdividing one edge @xmath129 times .",
    "then @xmath128 has @xmath130 vertices and @xmath131 edges .",
    "thus the dimension of the cycle code is @xmath132 , and the rate of the cycle code is @xmath133 . for each natural number @xmath0",
    "we let @xmath129 be the largest natural number such that @xmath134 .",
    "then @xmath135 . also , @xmath136 .",
    "recall that the number of cycles in @xmath36 and hence also in @xmath128 is @xmath137 . substituting these values in the definition of @xmath138 and letting @xmath0",
    "tend to infinity , we conclude that @xmath139 .",
    "the trivial upper bound shows that this inequality is , in fact , an equality .",
    "consider next the case where @xmath140 for where @xmath122 is natural number @xmath123 .",
    "let @xmath105 be the cycle of length @xmath0 where each edge has been duplicated @xmath122 times .",
    "this graph has @xmath0 vertices and @xmath141 edges .",
    "the number of cycles in this graph is    @xmath142 the first term counting cycles of length @xmath0 and the second cycles of length @xmath143 the graph is regular of degree @xmath106 .",
    "hence it has @xmath144 edges and has rate @xmath145 .",
    "hence its cycle code is an @xmath146$]-code .",
    "if we delete an edge , then we get an @xmath147$]-code . deleting an edge",
    "reduces the number of cycles only slightly . letting @xmath0 and",
    "hence also @xmath46 tend to infinity , we conclude that    @xmath148    now assume that @xmath149 , where @xmath122 is a ( fixed ) natural number @xmath123 .",
    "then we let @xmath150 denote the graph obtained from @xmath105 by adding @xmath129 edges between neighboring vertices such that all edge multiplicities are @xmath122 or @xmath151 .",
    "the resulting graph @xmath150 has @xmath0 vertices and @xmath152 edges .",
    "thus the dimension of the cycle code is @xmath153 , and the rate of the cycle code is @xmath154 .",
    "we first choose any @xmath0 so large that the rate of @xmath105 , which is @xmath145 , is smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "then we let @xmath129 be the largest natural number such that the rate of @xmath150 , which is @xmath155 , is smaller than or equal to @xmath18 .",
    "that is , @xmath156 .",
    "then the cycle code of @xmath150 is an @xmath157$]-code , where @xmath158 is the number of edges of @xmath150 .",
    "the number of cycles in @xmath150 is @xmath159 .",
    "if we substitute these values in the definition of @xmath138 and let @xmath0 tend to infinity , then we conclude that    @xmath160    the right hand side is clearly a linear function . for @xmath18",
    "equal to @xmath121 or @xmath125 the right hand side has the same values as the lower bounds we obtained for those two values of @xmath18 .",
    "so we have obtained a lower bound for @xmath118 which is continuous and piecewise linear .",
    "we claim that this lower bound is also an upper bound .",
    "we used the graph @xmath150 above .",
    "if we put @xmath161 , then @xmath150 has the maximum number of cycles among those graphs with @xmath1 edges which are obtained from a cycle of length @xmath0 by duplicating edges .",
    "the graphs used to give the lower bound @xmath97 in theorem 3 are also graphs of this type .",
    "hence @xmath150 has at least @xmath97 cycles .",
    "on the other hand , theorem 3 says that any graph with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 edges has at most @xmath103 cycles .",
    "so no graph with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 edges has more than @xmath1 times as many cycles as @xmath150 .",
    "hence the lower bound for @xmath118 obtained from the graphs @xmath150 is also an upper bound .",
    "the function @xmath118 is less than the matroid upper bound for all @xmath18 and also less than the random upper bound for @xmath28 .",
    "the agrell upper bound gives the same upper bound on @xmath102 as the trivial upper bound .",
    "figure 1 shows these bounds .",
    "cycle codes of cubic ( that is , @xmath162-regular ) graphs have enjoyed particular attention because in order to answer the afore - mentioned question by entringer and slater @xcite , it suffices to consider cubic graphs .",
    "the investigations in this paper indicate that the @xmath4-regular graphs also deserve attention .",
    "first of all , their cycle codes have rate @xmath163 , and this is the smallest value of @xmath18 for which the function @xmath118 changes shape . here",
    "we shall provide another reason .",
    "although it is merely an observation we call it a theorem because of the striking exceptions that appear in the statement .",
    "a graph is _ eulerian _ if it is connected and all vertices have even degree .",
    "these graphs are particularly interesting in the present context because the vector @xmath164 consisting of ones is a code word .",
    "recall that a _ hamiltonian cycle _ in a graph is a cycle containing all vertices .",
    "if @xmath10 is an eulerian graph with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath1 edges , then @xmath10 has at most @xmath2 cycles unless @xmath10 is a subdivision of a @xmath4-regular graph which is a union of two hamiltonian cycles .",
    "* proof:*the map sending a codeword @xmath165 into the codeword @xmath166 is a map from the cycle code into itself . if the codeword of every cycle is mapped into a codeword which does not correspond to a cycle , then at most half of the @xmath15 codewords correspond to cycles , and the result follows .",
    "so we may assume that @xmath10 has a cycle @xmath7 such that both its codeword @xmath165 and also the codeword @xmath166 correspond to cycles , say @xmath167 .",
    "hence @xmath10 can not have a vertex of degree @xmath168 or more .",
    "each of @xmath167 contains precisely two edges incident with each vertex of degree @xmath4 . and each edge of @xmath10 belongs to precisely one of @xmath167 .",
    "so @xmath167 is a partition of @xmath10 into two hamiltonian cycles after the vertices of degree @xmath169 have been replaced by edges .     versus @xmath18 ]",
    "figure 1 shows as a function of @xmath17      the function @xmath118 is known exactly .",
    "it is @xmath173 for @xmath174 and @xmath175 for @xmath176 the function @xmath102 seems more problematic .",
    "thus @xmath177 for @xmath174 while for @xmath28 we only have the bounds @xmath178 the best known upper bound for @xmath28 .",
