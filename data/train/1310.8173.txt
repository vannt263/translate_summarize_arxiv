    "in this section , we compare the approaches based on mean - field theory , dispersive theory , and our variational ansatz , to predict the ground - state of the spin - boson lattice model in eq .  . for concreteness",
    ", we restrict to an anti - ferromagnetic one - dimensional chain of @xmath131 spins and @xmath131 bosons with all relevant parameters defined below eq .  ,",
    "@xmath132 although we note that the approaches can be generalized to other cases straightforwardly .",
    "there is a variety of mean - field ( mf ) approximations in many - body problems  @xcite , all of which share the property of neglecting the correlations among the different particles of the system .",
    "we focus on variational mean - field theory  @xcite , which looks for an upper bound of the ground - state energy by minimising over a family of variational product states ( i.e. no correlations ) . for spin systems",
    "@xcite , one can propose a mean - field ansatz based on a product of spin coherent states  @xcite .",
    "this procedure can be generalized to the spin - boson model   by considering the _ mean - field ansatz as a product state of both spin and bosonic coherent states_. this approach has been used previously for the rabi lattice model in  @xcite , where due to the boson - boson coupling , the correct basis for the coherent states is given by the delocalized collective modes . in our case  ,",
    "as the bosons form a localized flat band , we can use the local modes as a basis , such that our mean - field ansatz is @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the set of variational parameters , such that @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in the definition of the coherent states , we use as reference states @xmath137 , and the vacuum @xmath138 .",
    "although this ansatz neglects all possible correlations in the system , it is a good starting point to gain a qualitative understanding .",
    "the variational minimization , @xmath139 , leads to an algebraic system of @xmath140 equations . assuming periodic boundary conditions , and introducing the mean - field coupling @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , the solution to this system of equations is @xmath143 where @xmath144 , and @xmath41 is the heaviside step function ( i.e. @xmath145 if @xmath146 , and zero elsewhere ) .",
    "hence , the mean - field ground - state can be written as follows @xmath147 which has the energy @xmath148 .",
    "we can identify two phases :    _ ( i ) hybrid paramagnetic phase _ : if @xmath149 , the variational parameters corresponding to the minimum are @xmath150 , and @xmath151 .",
    "the mean - field ground - state is thus @xmath152 corresponding to a paramagnetic phase with all spins pointing anti - parallel to the transverse field @xmath153 , and the bosonic vacuum .    _",
    "( ii ) hybrid anti - ferromagnetic phase : _ if @xmath154 , we find that @xmath155 , @xmath156 , such that the ground - state displays an alternating order @xmath157 of both spin and boson polarisations . here , @xmath158 are bosonic coherent states , and @xmath159 , @xmath160 are the spin states .",
    "let us note that for @xmath161 , we obtain @xmath162 , and thus recover a hybrid ground - state that resembles a nel - ordered state @xmath163 .",
    "the mf theory thus predicts a paramagnetic to anti - ferromagnetic phase transition at @xmath164 , namely @xmath165 .",
    "this is the parabola represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : statics]*(a ) * ( black @xmath30 ) . as customary in mf theories , the exact location of the critical point ( or line ) differs markedly from the prediction .",
    "yet , mf theory is useful to understand qualitative the hybrid magnetism that will involve the spontaneous polarization of both spins and bosons .",
    "in fact , it predicts @xmath166 as outlined in the main text , the magnetic critical exponent would be @xmath44 , since @xmath167 in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath168 .",
    "considering the mf results , we have seen that the phase transition depends on the competition of two energy scales , @xmath169 and @xmath141 .",
    "the dependence of the latter on the hamiltonian parameters , namely @xmath170 , suggests that it arises from the spin - boson coupling in second - order perturbation theory @xmath171 .",
    "since the spin - phonon coupling is highly off - resonant @xmath172 in this regime ( i.e. the so - called dispersive regime ) , it will only excite bosons virtually .",
    "thus , it is possible to trace the bosons out , and obtain a spin dynamics where the _ spin - spin interactions are mediated by the exchange of such virtual bosons_.",
    "the leitmotiv is that , by tracing out the bosons , it might be possible to improve on the mf by keeping the spin correlations in the theory .",
    "this can be formalized by a _",
    "schrieffer - wolff transformation _",
    "@xcite , as already used for jaynes - cummings and rabi models on the lattice  @xcite . for such models ,",
    "the finite bandwidth of the collective bosonic modes leads to a spin - spin interaction whose range depends on the boson - boson coupling . in the present case  , as the bosonic modes are localized , the emerging spin - spin interactions will be short - ranged ( i.e. nearest neighbor ) . to obtain the effective model",
    ", the first step is to realize that for @xmath171 , the hilbert space will be clustered in manifolds characterized by the total number of bosons @xmath173 separated in energies by @xmath97 .",
    "then , two distant spins couple by the virtual exchange of a boson either _",
    "( i ) _ going through the manifold of one extra boson @xmath174 , or _",
    "( ii ) _ through a lower - energy manifold with deficit of one boson @xmath175 . since these virtual processes have opposite detunings , their amplitudes cancel @xmath176 unless the exchanged boson belongs to the same site @xmath177 . in that case ,",
    "bosonic commutation rules imply that the amplitude is @xmath178 .",
    "accordingly , this schrieffer - wolff transformation leads to the effective hamiltonian @xmath179 where we have introduced the dispersive couplings @xmath180 and @xmath142 .",
    "we thus obtain a nearest - neighbor anti - ferromagnetic ising model in a transverse field , and a collection of uncoupled bosons .",
    "let us highlight that the nearest - neighbor character of the interactions is due to the design of the spin - boson interconnectivity in the lattice model  .",
    "we also note that the mf theory overestimates the spin couplings @xmath141 in comparison to the dispersive limit @xmath180 valid at @xmath171 .",
    "the effective model   can be diagonalised exactly  @xcite by using the so - called _ jordan - wigner transformation _",
    "@xcite , which writes the spin operators in terms of spinless fermions . to set the notation for the following sections , we review this solution here .",
    "the first step is to introduce the jordan - wigner fermions @xmath181 where @xmath182 are fermionic creation - annihilation operators .",
    "this turns the hamiltonian   into a quadratic model of decoupled fermions and bosons @xmath183 , where the bosonic part is already diagonal , and the fermionic one can be diagonalised by going to momentum space @xmath184 , assuming periodic boundary conditions , and using an additional _ fermionic bogoliubov transformation _",
    "@xcite , which reads @xmath185 where we have introduced @xmath186^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath187^{1/2}$ ] in terms of @xmath188 , and @xmath189^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this transformation diagonalizes the dispersive hamiltonian   @xmath190 from this expression , it is clear that the lowest - energy state will correspond to a product state composed of a fermi sea with all the negative - energy levels filled and a bosonic vacuum .",
    "hence , @xmath191 whose energy is given by @xmath192 .",
    "as announced above , this dispersive theory retains the correlations between the spins , at the expense of working in a regime @xmath171 where the bosonic ground - state can not spontaneously polarize .",
    "in fact , the equivalent of eq .   for the polarizations in the dispersive ground - state   becomes @xmath193 where @xmath194 .",
    "this predicts a critical line at @xmath195 , which amounts to the parabola @xmath196 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : statics]*(a ) * ( white @xmath31 ) .",
    "we observe in this figure that , although the prediction is better than the mf theory for @xmath172 , it underestimates the value of the critical point at larger couplings .",
    "moreover , although the theory captures the correct critical exponent @xmath197 in the qubit s polarization @xmath198 , it also predicts @xmath199 , which will turn out to be strictly correct only in the limit @xmath200 .",
    "hence , the dispersive theory misses completely the hybrid character of the emerging magnetism of our spin - boson lattice model  .      in this section ,",
    "we introduce a many - body ansatz that combines the best of the two previous approximations : _",
    "( i ) _ it captures the hybrid character of the magnetic order , and _",
    "( ii ) _ it keeps correlations to have a more accurate description of the phase transition . to comply with these requirements , we make use of a _ lang - firsov - type transformation _",
    "@xcite for our spin - boson lattice model   @xmath201 we note that similar transformations have already been used to study rabi lattice models in the dispersive regime @xmath171 in the context of trapped ions  @xcite . in this regime , this _ lang - firsov transformation absorbs all the relevant spin - boson correlations _ , and the unitarily - transformed hamiltonian consists of a set of interacting spins decoupled from the bosons ( i.e. analogous to eq .  ) .",
    "our idea is to incorporate this transformation into a many - body ansatz @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is some reference state , such that the ansatz is capable of exploring more general regimes ( i.e. ultra - strong coupling @xmath204 ) .",
    "our intuition to choose this reference state is the following : _",
    "( i ) _ as the transformation   captures most of the spin - boson correlations , we can use a reference state with no additional spin - boson entanglement . _",
    "( ii ) _ as the bosons in eq .   are not directly coupled , we can use a reference state with no boson - boson correlations . _",
    "( iii ) _ as the transformation   leads to some effective spin - spin interactions , we have to use a reference state that allows for spin - spin correlations .",
    "we thus propose @xmath205 where @xmath206 is a set of @xmath207 complex constants spanning the full spin hilbert space , and @xmath208 is a set of @xmath131 real constants used to define the bosonic coherent states .",
    "a variational minimization for   leads to @xmath209 , where the transformed hamiltonian @xmath21 reads @xmath210 here , the effective spin - spin interactions have a strength @xmath180 that coincides with the dispersive calculation  . using standard properties of the bosonic coherent states , we find @xmath211 and @xmath212 since @xmath213 .",
    "accordingly , the variational minimization over the spin and bosonic parameters completely decouples , and we obtain @xmath214 with the following ansatz s spin hamiltonian @xmath215 which corresponds to an _ anti - ferromagnetic ising model in a renormalized transverse field _ @xmath216 .    the variational problem can be easily solved by following the steps in eqs .  - , making the corresponding substitution @xmath217 in all expressions .",
    "we thus find that @xmath150 , and the constants @xmath218 correspond to the bogoliubov fermions in the spin - representation . for concreteness , we rewrite the expressions of the bogoliubov modes @xmath219 where we have introduced @xmath220^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath221^{1/2}$ ] , in terms of @xmath222 , and @xmath223^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "hence , our variational ansatz predicts the ground - state @xmath224 which has the energy @xmath225 .",
    "let us highlight that , although the result seems equal to the dispersive ground - state  , there are two crucial differences : _ ( i ) _ the bogoliubov fermions in @xmath47 correspond now to a different transverse field @xmath226 , the renormalisation of which can be understood as the effect of the vacuum fluctuations of the lattice bosons . _",
    "( ii ) _ the presence of the lang - firsov transformation @xmath227 in eq .",
    "accounts for the fundamental spin - boson entanglement , and the hybrid nature of the magnetic order .",
    "in fact , the analogue of eq .   for the polarisations within our ansatz is @xmath228 where @xmath40 .",
    "this predicts a critical line at @xmath229 , which amounts to the curve @xmath230 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : statics]*(a ) * ( red dashed line ) .",
    "we observe a remarkable agreement of our prediction with the numerics , even when approaching the ultra - strong coupling regime @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , our many - body ansatz captures the correct critical exponent @xmath43 in both the qubit s and the boson s polarization .",
    "hence , we can conclude that both spins and bosons display a quantum phase transition whereby their polarization scales according to the ising universality class .",
    "more importantly , the accuracy of our ansatz is preserved all the way , from weak to strong coupling regimes .",
    "in this section , we clarify the origin of the model adopted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) , and discuss the role of the diamagnetic @xmath111 term .",
    "such a term forbids a superradiant phase transition in the dicke model describing an ensemble of two - level atoms interacting with a single mode of the electromagnetic field  @xcite . in particular , a sum rule for the dipole oscillator strengths in cavity qed imposes a constraint that is incompatible with the parameter regime where a superradiant phase would occur .",
    "in contrast , it was recently shown that a superradiant phase transition can take place in a circuit - qed version . here ,",
    "superconducting qubits are capacitively coupled to a single resonator , which also leads to the equivalent of the diamagnetic @xmath111 term  @xcite .",
    "considering our specific setup of interspersed qubits and resonators in circuit - qed , we show that this diamagnetic term does not impede the existence of the @xmath231 hybrid quantum phase transition either , and that the predictions made with the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) remain valid if one renormalizes the hamiltonian parameters adequately .",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian of the lattice of microwave resonators coupled to the charge qubits displayed in fig .",

    "similarly , we have the charge @xmath237 and magnetic flux @xmath238 for the charge qubits , and the josephson energy term @xmath239 with amplitude @xmath240 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath241 , @xmath242 describe the effective gate charge and gate capacitance , respectively .",
    "given the cooper pair charge @xmath243 , and the uniform charge energy @xmath244 , we may also fix the capacitive term @xmath245 of the charge qubit .",
    "this hamiltonian contains three types of terms , which in order of appearance are : _ (",
    "i ) _ the resonator hamiltonian , _",
    "( ii _ ) the qubit hamiltonian , and _",
    "( iii ) _ the coupling term . in this last term ,",
    "in addition to the qubit - resonator coupling , one also finds a renormalization of the frequency of the resonator , @xmath246 , and of the qubit itself , @xmath247 .",
    "the @xmath248 term , when written in terms of fock operators of the resonator , is the well known @xmath111 term that prevents the dicke phase transition in a model with many qubits in the same optical cavity .",
    "we will now show that in our case , this term does not forbid the spin - boson quantum phase transition .",
    "we will first isolate the harmonic oscillator or bosonic terms . introducing the coordination number of the lattice , that is the number of qubits that talk to the same cavity ( i.e. @xmath249 in fig .",

    "this is in clear contrast to the dicke model , where the frequency of the bosonic mode is renormalized by its coupling with all two - level atoms , and thus depends on the total number of qubits @xmath131 , which may increase to large numbers .",
    "let us also note that the new bosonic operators @xmath256 for the renormalized frequency @xmath257 can be expressed in terms of the original operators @xmath258 at the bare frequency @xmath259 by means of a bogoliubov transformation , and therefore can be understood as squeezed modes of the resonator .",

    ", we can still find a sweet spot where the two lowest energy levels are formed by linear superpositions of states containing a different numbers of cooper pairs @xmath263 separated by a qubit energy @xmath264 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath265 , where @xmath266 .",
    "we thus see that the qubit - resonator coupling only modifies the condition on the sweet spot , but not the qubit frequency .",
    "finally , the qubit - resonator or spin - boson coupling is provided by the following term @xmath267 after expressing the resonator charge operator in terms of the fock operators  , and the qubit charge operator in the two - level approximation @xmath268 , where @xmath269 , we find that @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the spin - boson coupling strength , and the purely bosonic terms cancel due to the summation .",
    "altogether , the final model , including the renormalizations mentioned above due to the @xmath111 terms , reads @xmath272 which is essentially a renormalized version of the form adopted in the manuscript in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) with an imaginary spin - boson coupling strength . in the following section , we will show that this slightly modified model still displays a quantum phase transition , and does not suffer from any no - go theorem .",

    "the critical line corresponds to @xmath278 , or equivalently @xmath279 as explained in the text .",

    "@xcite , the renormalization of the cavity frequency due to the @xmath111 terms is independent from the qubit frequency itself . in other words",

    "this falls well within the dynamic range of @xmath114 : the value of this frequency can be tuned replacing the junction with a squid , so that the total value of @xmath114 is upper bounded by the josephson energy normally @xmath283 by one or two orders of magnitude , and it can be continuously switched down to almost zero .     vs. coupling strength @xmath284 , all relative to the qubit gap @xmath114 .",
    "this representation is useful because the ratio @xmath285 must be bounded to preserve the anharmonicity of a transmon qubit . ]",
    "the previous is a very particular argument that relies on a charge qubit in our microscopic model .",
    "however , using any other qubit transmons , phase qubits , flux qubits one would arrive to the same quantum hamiltonian ( [ modified_h ] ) with probably larger coupling strengths and better coherence properties . instead of studying again the capacitances and inductances that would make the phase transition possible and taking into account the renormalization effects ,",
    "a very simple idea is to just replace @xmath286 with typical values of cavity , qubit and coupling energies obtained in different experiments .",
    "note that doing so _ we already take into account the renormalization _ effects that have been suffered by the qubit and the cavity : as current experiments have been done with one to four qubits , these effects are already larger than those for a setup with coordination number @xmath249 introduced before .    to simplify the analysis we have produced fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] above , which relates the critical cavity frequency to the relative coupling strength .",
    "let us assume for instance a transmon with coupling strength around @xmath287 , a value which is still below the anharmonicity and preserves the qubit nature of this circuit .",
    "assuming @xmath288ghz , the cavity should be around 200 mhz , which is still above significant thermal excitations .",

    "<S> @xmath100  @xcite for flux qubits . in all cases , the critical point and </S>",

    "<S> note also that in all the qubits considered so far , the resulting figures are above typical decoherence times @xmath106s , and for flux qubits the spin couplings can reach values of ghz , competitive with state - of - the - art ising interactions in d - wave setups  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> note that , while spin interactions are a recurrent topic in superconducting circuits , the setup proposed in this work represents a non - incremental development that preserves the best features of circuit - qed ( strong coupling , fast dynamics , large quality factors ) and introduces new detection capabilities . unlike models  @xcite based on direct capacitive  @xcite or inductive  @xcite qubit - qubit interactions , the presence of cavities as mediators introduces a non - invasive place for local control and measurement of the quantum magnet . moreover , our model and theory work with strong and ultra - strong spin - spin interactions @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with earlier ideas of quantum magnetism in coupled cavities , which either demand weak cavity - cavity couplings to map the polariton physics onto spin models , @xmath108  @xcite , or are based on dispersive couplings  @xcite , which are weak by definition @xmath109 .    to perform the measurements , instead of probing the qubits </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest using weak links to the individual cavities . these antennae can be permanent , or they can be mobile  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they can also measure all cavities , in which case the transform   would be immediate , but it is also possible to recover the dispersion relation from measuring three consecutive cavities and relating their spectra through appropriate linear equations .    using the same setup it should be possible to do simple transmission - reflection experiments , which are enough to characterize the closing of the gap and extract the static critical exponent . moreover , relying on incident non - classical states , such as single - photons , opens the door to nonlinear phenomena which are beyond the scope of this work , such as pauli exclusion and blockade induced quantum gates in the transported excitations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally comment on the possibility of no - go theorems for the existence of quantum phase transitions , such as those for the dicke model  @xcite . in these theorems </S>",
    "<S> , the physical qubit - cavity coupling induces an additional renormalization of the cavity frequency @xmath97 , which depends on the coupling strength @xmath110 , and prevents any phase transition in optical setups  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are two ways to elude a no - go theorem in our case : _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ we can use flux qubits , where the magnetic dipolar coupling is linear and lacks @xmath111 terms . </S>",
    "<S> a state - of - the - art flux qubit can reach @xmath112  @xcite , implying that the phase transition happens at @xmath113 , a reasonable value . </S>",
    "<S> _ ( ii ) _ we can use charge qubits , where even though capacitive couplings introduce @xmath111 terms , there are enough free parameters to satisfy the critical relation , as shown in  @xcite for the dicke model , and elaborated in  @xcite for the present setup . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even if @xmath7 depends non - linearly on the qubit - cavity capacitance , tuning the josephson energy of the qubit changes @xmath114 , such that the critical point is accesible . in particular , for @xmath115 the qubit frequency must be adjusted within @xmath116 . to be more concrete </S>",
    "<S> , we note that renormalization effects depend on the lattice coordination number ( e.g. 2 in 1d )  @xcite , and can thus never be larger than experimentally observed values with two or more qubits inside a resonator . </S>",
    "<S> we thus use typical measured values of @xmath117 and @xmath114 to understand whether the phase transition is within reach . for transmons with a coupling @xmath118 not exceeding their anharmonicity  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the critical point is reached for @xmath101ghz and @xmath119mhz , values within experimental reach and within the regime in which thermal fluctuations would not affect the preparation of the ground state .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions. _ in this work , we have presented a hybrid spin - photon model that implements strong quantum magnetism and ising - type quantum phase transitions even in regimes of ultrastrong photon - qubit couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how to recover information about the phase transition and critical exponents from static measurements and many - body spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> we have also developed a simple yet powerful theory that explains the phase transition and the low - energy excitations .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , and most importantly , our setup allows for very flexible geometric and dynamical design of the interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the possibility of : _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ arbitrary 2d and 3d geometries by a proper design of the qubit - resonator interconnectivity in eq .  ; _ ( ii ) _ locally choosing ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions or introducing disorder , or _ ( iii ) _ modulating the cavities and qubits to move from ising to xy models . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this architecture combines the flexibility of the d - wave setup for ising interactions  @xcite , with the speed of resonant ultra - strong qubit - photon couplings . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be interesting to combine this setup with the effect of dissipative environments  @xcite .    </S>",
