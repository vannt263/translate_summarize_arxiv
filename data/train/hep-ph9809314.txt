    "<S> jet quenching as observed via high @xmath0 hadron production is studied in the hijing1.35 model . </S>",
    "<S> we test the model on recent wa98 data on 160 agev @xmath1 up to @xmath2 gev / c . </S>",
    "<S> the results depend sensitively on the model of the cronin effect . </S>",
    "<S> at ( rhic ) collider energies ( @xmath3 agev ) , on the other hand , semi - hard hadron production becomes insensitive to the above model and is thus expected to be a cleaner probe of jet quenching signature associated with non - abelian radiative energy loss .    </S>",
    "<S> = cmr8 1.5pt    wa98 @xmath1 data  @xcite in the @xmath4 range were analyzed recently by wang  @xcite via a parton model . </S>",
    "<S> he showed that the parton model  @xcite is capable of reproducing the observed @xmath5 invariant inclusive cross sections simultaneously in @xmath6 , @xmath7  @xcite , and central @xmath8  @xcite in the cern / sps energy range , @xmath9 agev . that analysis is interesting because it seems to imply the absence of quenching of high transverse momenta hadrons that should arise if partons lose energy in dense matter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 and @xmath8 data clearly reveal , on the other hand , the expected cronin enhancement  @xcite of moderate @xmath10 pions , as seen first in @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 data confirm the need to supplement the lla with non - perturbative intrinsic @xmath13  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we address this problem here , following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , using the hijing event generator  @xcite .    figure  [ fig : spectra ] displays the prediction of venus  @xcite and fritiof  @xcite models also for the pb+pb collision . </S>",
    "<S> it can be clearly seen that at high @xmath0 venus overpredict the experimental data of wa98 by a factor of 2.5 and fritiof underpredict it by order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> a similar discrepancy was reported for s+au collisions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve in figure  [ fig : spectra ] is the parton model result  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectra ]    we note that the spectra can also be fit well with a simple boosted fireball model  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : thermosau ] for s+au ) . </S>",
    "<S> however such fits are far less informative than the parton model model one since the observed @xmath14 scaling of the high @xmath0 tails is predicted and in accord with the parton model , while that dependence is not predicted in the fireball model . the wa98 data  @xcite can also be reproduced by more detailed scaling hydrodynamic calculations with suitable initial and final freeze - out criteria  @xcite . again </S>",
    "<S> the real power of pqcd is its prediction without parameters of the @xmath15 dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : thermosau ]    in central heavy ion reactions at the sps , conservative estimates of the initial energy density suggest that @xmath16 gev/@xmath17 , are reached . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon radiative energy loss of partons in such dense matter is expected to exceed @xmath18 gev / fm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical analysis  @xcite predicts in fact a much larger non - linear energy loss @xmath19 gev/@xmath20 if a parton traverses a quark - gluon plasma of thickness @xmath21 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the wa98 data seem to rule out @xmath22 gev / fm , as wang showed in ref .  @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we consider this problem using the nuclear collision event generator , hijing  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recall that in the lla , pqcd predicts that the single inclusive hadron cross section is given by refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite @xmath23 this formula convolutes the elementary pqcd parton - parton cross sections , @xmath24 , with non - perturbative lowest order fits of the parton structure functions , @xmath25 , and the parton fragmentation functions , @xmath26 , to @xmath27 and @xmath28 data . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath29 are the intrinsic transverse momenta of the colliding partons . </S>",
    "<S> the model includes a @xmath30 factor to simulate next - to leading order corrections  @xcite at a hard scale @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependence of the structure and fragmentation functions account for the multiple soft collinear radiative effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , below energies @xmath32 gev , it is well known  @xcite that lla significantly underpredicts the @xmath33 gev cross section , and additional non - perturbative effects must be introduced to bring lla into agreement with data . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , as emphasized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the results are then quite model dependent below collider ( rhic ) energies . as we show below </S>",
    "<S> , the good news is that this @xmath0 broadening dependence is reduced significantly at collider ( rhic ) energies .    in spite of the inherent ambiguity of the parton model analysis at sps energies , </S>",
    "<S> a successful phenomenological approaches to this problem has been developed via the introduction  @xcite of intrinsic transverse momenta of the colliding partons as in ( [ parton ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> originally , a gaussian form for that distribution with @xmath34 gev@xmath35 was proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to reproduce @xmath12 data more accurately and to take into account the cronin effect , the gaussian ansatz was generalized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to include @xmath36 and @xmath15 dependence . with @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> excellent fits  @xcite to the wa98 data could be obtained assuming a factorized gaussian distribution with @xmath38 where @xmath36 is measured here in ( gev / c)@xmath35 . in ( [ kick ] ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath39 is the average number of inelastic scatterings a nucleon suffers traversing nucleus @xmath15 at impact parameter @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear thickness function , @xmath41 , is normalized as usual to @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([kick ] ) is the main source of the model dependence in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the hijing1.35 monte carlo model  @xcite incorporates pqcd jet production together with initial and final state radiation according to the pythia algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it incorporates a variant of the soft string phenomenology similar to the lund / fritiof  @xcite and dpm  @xcite models to simulate beam jet fragmentation and jet hadronization physics . </S>",
    "<S> low transverse momenta inelastic processes are of course highly model dependent , and the parameters must be fit to @xmath12 and @xmath43 data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to apply hijing to the present study because it incorporates in addition to the above soft and hard dynamics , a model of soft ( cronin ) multiple initial state collision effects as well as a simple jet quenching scheme . with these features </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to study how competing aspects of the reaction mechanism influence hadronic observables and explore the magnitude of theoretical uncertainties .    in the hijing model , excited baryon string are assumed to pick up random transfer momentum kicks in each inelastic scattering according to the following distribution @xmath44 where @xmath45 gev / c were chosen to fit low energy ( @xmath46 gev / c ) multiparticle production data in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . a flag , ihpr2(5)(=1 or 0 ) , </S>",
    "<S> makes it possible to compute spectra with and without this effect as shown in part ( a ) of figure  [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the present study is the first test of this model up to @xmath2 gev / c in the sps energy range .    </S>",
    "<S> jet quenching is modeled via gluon splitting according to the number of mean free paths , @xmath47 fm , traversed by a gluon through the cylindrical nuclear reaction volume . in each partonic inelastic interaction a gluon of energy @xmath48 is assumed to be split off the parent jet and incorporated as a kink in another baryonic string  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( constant ) energy loss per unit length is an input parameter ( hipr1(14 ) in hijing  @xcite ) and can switched on and off via ihpr2(4 ) ( = 1 or 0 ) to test the sensitivity of spectra to jet quenching as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] compares the predictions of hijing1.35  @xcite without jet quenching ( @xmath49 ) for the invariant @xmath50 cross section in central nuclear collisions at sps and rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for central @xmath51 collisions are computed integrating over the impact parameters up to @xmath52 chosen to reproduce experimental trigger cross sections . for wa98 @xmath8 and rhic @xmath53 we took @xmath54 fm , while for the wa80 @xmath7 we took @xmath55 fm . </S>",
    "<S> the multiple collision eikonal geometry in hijing is based on standard wood - saxon nuclear densities .    </S>",
    "<S> the parton model fit to the wa98 data are labeled by wang from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the normalization of both the wa98 data and wang s latest calculations ( not shown ) have increased @xmath56 relative to ref .  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> we note that the hijing1.35 calculation for this interaction given by the solid jagged line also reproduces remarkably well the @xmath5 invariant cross sections without jet quenching . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the lighter @xmath7 reaction , hijing , underestimates the @xmath57 gev / c tail significantly . </S>",
    "<S> this error is traced to the failure of the model to reproduce the @xmath12 high @xmath10 data at these energies , in contrast to its successful account of higher energy data  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen by comparing the filled squares to the dot - dashed curves as explained below . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we find that the agreement with the wa98 data is accidental and the observed @xmath15 scaling of the high @xmath10 region at sps energies is not reproduced .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3]a shows that the soft transverse momentum kick model is the source for the agreement of hijing with the @xmath8 data . </S>",
    "<S> the dot - dashed curves show what happens if the soft @xmath10 kicks modeled with eq.([hjpt ] ) is turned off . </S>",
    "<S> the very strong decrease of the pion yield in the @xmath8 case and the somewhat smaller but still large decrease in the @xmath7 case shows clearly the important role multiple transverse kicks at these energies . </S>",
    "<S> in fact both @xmath7 and @xmath8 dot - dashed curves are found to coincide with the calculated @xmath58 differential cross section scaled by the wounded nucleon factor @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the average number of wounded projectile nucleons and @xmath61 mb for @xmath62 .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the data follow closely the shape of the measured @xmath63 data taken from @xcite and scaled to @xmath64 by multiplying by the glauber binary collision number factor , @xmath65 . from hijing the average number of binary collisions in these systems </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath66 , @xmath67 resp . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the wa98 data scale with the above glauber factor within a factor of three , suggests that the additional @xmath10 broadening due to initial state collisions is relatively small . </S>",
    "<S> the very large @xmath15 dependence of the hijing @xmath10 tail at sps energies is due to the @xmath68 times convolution of the distribution ( [ hjpt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is avoided in the parton model calculation  @xcite using ( [ kick ] ) through the separation of larger intrinsic momentum effects and smaller @xmath68 dependent contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the missing intrinsic transverse momentum component of hijing precludes an accurate simultaneous reproduction of of @xmath69 data at sps energies . however , unlike the parton model where no global conservation laws have to be enforced , it is not clear how to incorporate intrinsic momenta in a global event generator like hijing without destroying the satisfactory reproduction of _ low _ @xmath46 gev / c data . </S>",
    "<S> we do not attempt to solve this problem here .    </S>",
    "<S> our main point is that this problem goes away fortunately at higher ( rhic ) collider energies ( @xmath70 agev ) . </S>",
    "<S> as seen in figure  [ fig3]a the effect of multiple soft interactions is very much reduced at that energy . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the well known effect that as the beam energy increases , the @xmath10 spectra become harder and additional @xmath10 smearing from initial state effects becomes relatively less important . </S>",
    "<S> it is the extreme steepness of the cross sections at sps energies that amplifies so greatly the sensitivity of the moderate @xmath10 yields to this aspect of multiple collision dynamics .    in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b we consider next the sensitivity of the pion yields to the sought after parton energy loss dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the striking difference between figure  [ fig3]a and figure  [ fig3]b is that in figure  [ fig3]b the sps yield is not sensitive to the energy loss model in hijing , while at rhic energies the suppression of semi - hard hadrons is seen to be sensitive to jet quenching as predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this seems counter intuitive at first because the increasing steepness with decreasing beam energy is naively expected to result in greater quenching for a fixed jet energy loss . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this model the observed @xmath10 range is dominated by multiple soft collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the moderate @xmath71 gev quarks , which fragment into the observed pions , are not produced in rare pqcd semi - hard interactions but are gently nudged several times into that @xmath10 range . since in hijing jet - quenching is restricted to only those partons that suffer a semi - hard pqcd interaction with @xmath10 at least @xmath72 gev / c ( the mini - jet scale ) , no quenching arises at this energy .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we found that hijing1.35 fits the wa98 data with or without jet quenching . </S>",
    "<S> however , this model fails to account for the weak @xmath15 dependence of the data that scale approximately with the glauber @xmath73 factor , and therefore the fit must be viewed as accidental . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrodynamic model fits  @xcite of wa98 data  @xcite unfortunately make no prediction for the a dependence . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , another monte carlo parton cascade model  @xcite overpredicted the @xmath5 cross section at @xmath2 gev / c by a factor of 10 . </S>",
    "<S> those results and ours emphasize the strong model dependence of the sps spectra due to non - perturbative aspects of the problem . those aspects , while phenomenologically interesting , make it difficult to identify perturbative qcd phenomena and search for jet quenching .    </S>",
    "<S> the main point of this work is to emphasize the good news that at collider energies there is much less sensitivity to the above uncertain element of the reaction mechanism . at @xmath74 agev the expected  @xcite jet quenching signature should be readily observable in the @xmath75 gev range . such experiments will commence in 1999 at rhic and should provide important tests of the theory of non - abelian multiple collisions and energy loss  @xcite . </S>"
