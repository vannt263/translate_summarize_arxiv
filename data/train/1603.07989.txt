    ", the study of topological band theory has been extended to bosonic systems .",
    "a natural extension of topological properties of fermionic systems to bosonic systems can be achieved by replacing the lattice sites of fermions with bosons @xcite .",
    "hence , the fermionic operators can be regarded as bosonic operators obeying a different commutation relation .    in the hardcore limit , the bosonic systems map to spin-@xmath0 quantum magnets @xcite .",
    "this correspondence is very crucial as it paves the way to interpret results in terms of bosons as well as spin variables .",
    "it also means that the excitations of hard - core bosons must be the underlying spin wave excitations ( magnons ) of the corresponding quantum spin model .",
    "therefore , the topological properties of the bosonic excitations must be similar to that of spin wave excitations . in this regard , the haldane spin - orbit coupling @xcite in the hardcore limit maps to an out - of - plane dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) , which induces a nonzero berry curvature and thermal hall effect of magnetic spin excitations @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to fermionic systems , there is neither a fermi energy nor a filled band in bosonic systems .",
    "this means that the topological invariant quantity usually called the chern number must be independent of the statistical nature of the particles .",
    "it simply predicts the existence of edge state modes in the vicinity of the bulk energy gap as a result of the bulk - edge correspondence .",
    "this leads to edge states in bosonic systems .",
    "unfortunately , many topological bosonic models have a numerical sign problem that hinders an explicit quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation due to an imaginary statistical average . in a recent study ,",
    "guo _ et al _   @xcite have investigated the bose - hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice using qmc .",
    "this model is devoid of the debilitating qmc sign problem as there is no imaginary phase amplitude .",
    "it is analogous to fermionic graphene model without spin - orbit coupling in the presence of a biased potential @xcite .",
    "the authors have explicitly mapped out the bosonic quantum phase diagram , the berry curvature and edge states characterizing the topological properties of the system induced by a staggered on - site potential .    in this paper , we present another perspective of their qmc results using a semiclassical approach .",
    "the qmc results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite utilized the electronic analogue of the bose - hubbard model . here",
    ", we show that the entire qmc analysis can be understood semi - classically .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hardcore - bose - hubbard model is merely a spin-@xmath0 quantum xy model with competing sublattice magnetic fields , thus the results can also be interpreted in terms of magnetic spins and the semiclassical approach is known to be suitable for such models @xcite .",
    "we find that the quantum phase diagram uncovered by qmc can actually be understood by mean - field theory .",
    "we uncover the same three insulating phases : superfluid ( sf ) , mott insulator phase , and charge - density - wave ( cdw ) insulator .",
    "the latter insulating phase is a consequence of the competing sublattice magnetic fields .",
    "as mentioned above , the correspondence between hard - core bosons and quantum spin systems suggests that the spin wave excitations correspond to the bosonic excitations .",
    "as qmc showed , the topological properties of this system is manifested by a nonzero berry curvature .",
    "we show that the berry curvature of the magnon excitations in the @xmath1 cdw insulator has the same trend as the one obtain by qmc simulation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to dmi induced edge states with nonzero chern number @xcite , the chern number of the present model vanishes . nevertheless , we observe zigzag bosonic magnon edge states which do not have the same origin as those in dmi system @xcite .",
    "it is noted that nontrivial topology has been realized in two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical fermionic @xcite and bosonic @xcite atoms .",
    "thus , our results are applicable to these systems .",

    "the main purpose of this paper is to show that the magnon excitation of the bose - hubbard model [ hardcore ] embodies the topological properties of this system .",
