    "in recent years more attention is given to rare explosions and outbursts in the energy gap between novae and supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "those outbursts , known as intermediate - luminosity - optical - transients ( ilots ) form a family that has a number of sub - groups ( for a detailed nomenclature see @xcite ) . among these",
    "are found giant eruptions in massive stars ( aka supernova [ sn ] impostors ) , such as the great eruption of , merger - bursts ( also termed red novae or luminous red novae or red transients ) like v838  mon , and intermediate - luminosity red transients ( iltrs ) like sn  2008s .",
    "researchers have taken several different approaches in modeling ilots .",
    "these can generally be divided to a class of single - star models ( e.g. , @xcite for ilrts and ofek et al .",
    "2013 for a sn impostor ) , and a class of rich variety types of binary interaction ( @xcite ) .    binary interaction that might lead to ilots include also the common envelope evolution ( cee ) or the onset of the cee @xcite , as well as mass loss through the second lagrangian point @xcite .",
    "a useful tools to characterize ilots include a diagram of peak luminosity versus eruption duration ( time scale ) @xcite , and the energy - time diagram ] ( etd ) , where the ilot total energy is plotted versus their eruption duration @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : etd ] shows the etd with the ots and the ilots that populate it .",
    "many of the ilots sit on the optical transient stripe ( ots ) in the etd , suggesting they are powered by a similar source of energy .",
    "we will present the new ingredients in the etd presented in figure [ fig : etd ] in section [ sec : etd ] .",
    "one group of ilots is the luminous red novae ( aka red transients or merger - bursts ) .",
    "these ilots are powered by a complete merger of two stars .",
    "as one star is destroyed on to the other , gravitational energy is released and powers the transient .",
    "examples for such outbursts are v838  mon @xcite and v1309  sco @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that a v838  mon like merger - burst can happen on smaller scales and low energies  between a planet and a low mass main - sequence ( ms ) star , between a planet and a brown dwarf ( bd ) or between two planets . in this process",
    "the planet is tidally shredded into a disc , and the accretion of the gas in the disc onto the star / bd / other planet leads to an outburst . according to this model the destruction of the planet before it approaches the more massive object occurs since the density of the planet is lower than the density of the more massive object . taking the lowest mass of the destroyed planet to be @xmath1 ,",
    "these outbursts are suggested to populate the lower left part of the ots , with timescales of a few days and total energies of @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the thorough study by @xcite established the star - planet merger process as member of the ilot heterogeneous group .",
    "they studied interaction between a sun - like star and planets of @xmath4 , and found that different event are expected to happen depending on the ratio of the mean densities of the planet and the star . for low enough mean density of the planet , the interaction can either lead to tidal - dissipation event where the planet transfers mass at about steady rate to the star . for ratio in the range",
    "@xmath5@xmath6 @xcite found that the mass transfer is unsteady , resulting in a dynamical disruption of the planet into an accretion disc around the star .",
    "@xcite further calculated the luminosity of such a transient to be in the order of @xmath7 and time scale to be in the order of a few weeks .",
    "the all - sky automated survey for supernovae ( asas - sn ) variability survey @xcite discovered an outburst designated asassn-15qi ( also referred to as 2mass j22560882 + 5831040 ) on jd 2,457,298 ( 2 october 2015 ) . @xcite reported the observational properties of asassn-15qi in detail .",
    "the following make the asassn-15qi outburst interesting .",
    "( 1 ) its location among young objects , suggesting it is associated with a young stellar object ( yso ) .",
    "( 2 ) it showed a fast brightening of 3.5 mag in the optical bands in less than 23 hours .",
    "( 3 ) it blew a fast wind that faded as the outburst decayed over 4 - 5 months .",
    "@xcite calculated the outburst radiative energy to be @xmath8 over a duration of 6 months ; the kinetic energy might be much larger .",
    "@xcite mentioned that other yso outbursts , such as v899  mon and z  cma , share some similar spectroscopic features with asassn-15qi .",
    "they speculated that asassn-15qi might be either a mass transfer event , related to interactions between a star and a planet on an eccentric orbit , formation of an excretion disc , or by some magnetic reconnection and outflow event .",
    "considering the energy and timescale of asassn-15qi , the outburst can be placed on the etd close to our proposed merger of a planet with a low - mass ms star @xcite , but with lower energy . in this paper",
    "we propose an ilot model for asassn-15qi .",
    "we construct an ilot scenario for the yso outburst asassn-15qi , where a sub - jupiter young planet was tidally destroyed on to a young ms star . if our proposed scenario holds , this ilot is unusual in two regards .",
    "first it is not ` intermediate ' between novae and supernovae , as its luminosity is like that of novae .",
    "second , it is not red _ in situ _ as was argue for other ilots that are not lbv major outbursts , though it will appear red as a result of extinction .",
    "if a planet is to be tidally destroyed by a star , it must not be too dense . for this requirement to hold",
    ", the planet must be still larger than its final radius , namely , be very young .",
    "a saturn like planet ( mass of @xmath9 ) , for example , has a radius of @xmath10 at an age of @xmath11 myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) , compared to its final radius of @xmath12 .",
    "models for the radii at early evolution of planets depend on many parameters .",
    "the important ones are the planet composition , the size of the core , the accretion rate onto the core , the planet pressure profile , and the efficiency of cooling with the presence of stellar irradiation and tidal heating ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in a recent review @xcite present some modern calculations of planet radii at early evolution , still with a wide range of parameters . at an earlier age of @xmath13 myr the modeled radius is in a range given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the final radius of the planet .",
    "as the range is so large , and depends on so many factors ( including the age ) that we do not know for asassn-15qi , we shall use the most conservative , i.e. , pessimistic , value of @xmath16 .    equation ( [ eq : rp ] ) implies that the young planet is tidally destroyed at a larger reditus than for old planets .",
    "this tidal shredding radius is given by ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the star taken from @xcite .",
    "this radius is larger than the radius of the star . at this tidal destructed radius",
    "the keplerian time is @xmath19 days , which is well within the 23 hours constrain for the increase in luminosity of asassn-15qi @xcite . moreover , if the planet approaches at an eccentric orbit and periastron distance is smaller even , then the accretion process will be shorter even .",
    "a more extended study of the dependence of the outcome of a star - planet merger on the density ratio of the two bodies has been conducted by @xcite .",
    "we here study a case where the planet is destroyed outside the star , hence the density ratio requires a young planet .",
    "based on the behavior of some other ilots where there is more information on the kinetic energy of the ejected gas , e.g. , v838  mon @xcite , we crudely scale with a kinetic energy of this ilot that is an order of magnitude larger than the radiated energy , @xmath20 .",
    "for example , a mass of @xmath21 that is ejected at the observed velocity of @xmath22 @xcite has this kinetic energy .",
    "the accreted mass releases an energy of @xmath23    as suggested by @xcite , the accreted mass will plausibly form an accretion disc or an accretion belt around the star . as the object is young the disc",
    "is not expected to be flat .",
    "we will therefore calibrate @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the thickness of the disc and @xmath26 is the distance from of the accretion .",
    "the accretion time should be longer than the viscous time scale for the accreted mass to lose its angular momentum @xmath27 where in the equation above @xmath28 is the sound speed , @xmath29 is the disc viscosity parameter , @xmath30 is the keplerian velocity and @xmath31 is the viscosity of the disc",
    ".    a close look at the light curve of asassn-15qi shows that for about 5 days the decline in luminosity is very steep , and only after that it becomes more moderate .",
    "this might be related to the viscosity time of the proposed disc .",
    "why is this ilot not red ?",
    "the answer is the very low mass that is accreted and hence the very low mass that is potentially available to inflate an envelope and become a giant . in v838",
    "mon the destroyed low mass ms star gas inflated a giant envelope .",
    "the envelope of the merger product has a structure of an agb star .",
    "the luminosity of asassn-15qi is like that of an agb or an upper rgb star .",
    "however , when the envelope mass of agb stars decreases to @xmath32 they start to shrink , and when the envelope mass becomes several@xmath33 the envelope radius decreases to only several  @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this ilot",
    "the accreted mass was too low to be inflated to the size of a giant .",
    "the star stayed hot , and not much dust was formed .",
    "this ilot , although is under the name of ` luminous red nova ' ( see @xcite ) , is not red _ in situ_.    a similar scenario that leads to similar ilot properties can be constructed for a more massive young planet , like a young jupiter - like planet , whose periastron is such that only its low - density outer envelope is removed .",
    "namely , a mass of @xmath35 is removed from the planet and accreted by the star , but the planet survives the encounter .",
    "to add asassn-15qi to the etd we need to evaluate both the total energy and the eruption timescale .",
    "for the total energy we take @xmath36 , for the reasons explained above ( section [ sec : model ] ) .    estimating the timescale based on the lightcurve is somewhat complicated for the case of asassn-15qi .",
    "the criterion we usually use for the timescale for ilots is the time it takes for the lightcurve in the visible to decline by 3 magnitudes from the peak .",
    "this criterion is based on the fact that the v and r bands usually contain most of the energy for ilots , and that ilots have a characteristic lightcurve .",
    "namely , that ilots have similarity in the shape of their lightcurve from peak to decline by @xmath37 magnitudes , when scaling the time axis @xcite .",
    "the shape of the lightcurve of asassn-15qi does not resemble the characteristic lightcurve for any scaling in the time axis .",
    "the reason is related to asassn-15qi not being a regular ilot but rather a young ilot and with a low peak luminosity .",
    "namely , the peak luminosity is not much more than 3 mag above the pre and post outburst luminosity of the star .",
    "the lightcurve of asassn-15qi shows a few breaks at @xmath38 and @xmath39 after the peak .",
    "@xcite find an exponential decay of 1 magnitude in 6 days .",
    "it might be possible to fit the lightcurve with two or more power - laws fairly well , but we do not find a justified physical motivation to do so . we do notice that extrapolating the slope of the late decline after 90 days after the peak backwards in time , intersects the lightcurve at about 20 days after the peak , where there is one of the breaks .",
    "we do not claim it necessarily means anything , but it might indicate that the decline has two main phases , with a transition around 20 days after the peak . as we have no good determination of the timescale , we take it to be in the range @xmath40 .",
    "we place the marker on @xmath41 , though again , there is uncertainty in this value .",
    "figure [ fig : etd ] shows the etd with the new object added .",
    "we also extended the merger models of @xcite to include a set of collisions with a smaller merging planet with mass of @xmath42 .",
    "asassn-15qi has energy well below the energy of low energy novae",
    ". therefore it is not positioned on the ots .",
    "nevertheless we suggest that the physical mechanism that caused the eruption of asassn-15qi has similarities to ilots on the ots .",
    "namely , asassn-15qi is also a result of a merger process but has two significant differences from ilots on the ots : ( 1 ) the merging object is much lower in mass ( see section [ sec : model ] ) , and ( 2 ) the mean eddington ratio is much smaller @xmath43 compared to typical values on the ots @xmath44 . in the above equation @xmath45 is the opacity , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 have their usual meanings .",
    "we note that in some cases the energy of the transient can be larger , if extra energy comes from e.g. , hydrogen recombination .",
    "the first difference mentioned above , a lower mass merging object ( planet ) , is directly related to its age . if an evolved ( i.e. @xmath48  gyr )",
    "planet would collide with a planet / bd / star as in the set of models of @xcite that we extend here to lower masses planets , we would _ not _ expect an ilot .",
    "the reason , as we mention in section [ sec : model ] , is that the planet is expected to be too dense to be destructed by tidal force of the more massive object .",
    "namely @xmath49 ( equation [ eq : rs ] ) decreases with age , and can become smaller than the radius of the more massive object .",
    "it would therefore not form an accretion disc and would not create an ilot , but rather collide or just sink into the more massive object , not radiating much energy during the merger process .",
    "the ots , as discussed in previous papers , was plotted for evolved objects .",
    "we here extend it to younger objects , that are of lower mean density and can undergo tidal destruction , that would not have happened had they been @xmath48  gyr of age .",
    "we mark this region hatched - green in figure [ fig : etd ] .",
    "we examined the possibility that the unusual outburst of the yso asassn-15qi is an ilot event ( red nova ; merger - burst ) , similar in many respects to v838  mon , but much weaker .",
    "as v838  mon , the eruptive star was young , but unlike the model for v838  mon , the secondary star that had been destroyed was suggested here to be a saturn - like planet rather than a low mass ms star .",
    "the young age in both systems is crucial .",
    "the reason is that along most of the ms the density decreases as mass increases .",
    "therefore , low mass stars on the ms will not suffer a tidal destruction by more massive ms stars .",
    "this holds for sub - stellar secondary objects as well . in young systems ,",
    "the time scale on which the object shrinks to its final radius increases as mass decreases .",
    "therefore , young low - mass objects have lower density than their final density .",
    "the density can be low enough to allow tidal destruction if the secondary object comes close enough to the primary star .",
    "in old systems very low - mass main sequence stars and brown dwarfs have high density .",
    "therefore , in old systems planets can be tidally destructed on to them , as indicated by the three lines in the lower left of figure [ fig : etd ] .    the destruction of young planets on stars results in weak ilots , as we suggest here for asassn-15qi .",
    "the region on the etd of such event is marked by the hatched - green region in figure [ fig : etd ] .",
    "the luminosity of these events is not above novae , and they are not red _ in situ_. so they are not really ` intermediate ' and they are not internally red .",
    "the difference in the mass of the destroyed object between v838  mon and asassn-15qi brings a significant difference in the properties of the merger product , in addition to the difference in the peak luminosity and outburst energy .",
    "the luminosity of the outburst in both cases is in the range of giant stars . in the case of v838",
    "mon , part of the mass of the destroyed secondary star inflated a huge envelope . in our proposed model for the outburst of asassn-15qi , the mass that is available to inflate an envelope os @xmath50 .",
    "as is known from the evolution of post - agb stars , this mass is too low to build a large envelope .",
    "this is the reason that asassn-15qi was not intrinsically red , and did not form large amount of dust .",
    "ilots constitute an heterogeneous group of objects that covers a large area in the energy - time diagram ( etd ) or the luminosity - time diagram .",
    "we here suggest that this group that is powered by gravitational energy in binary systems is more heterogeneous and covers a larger area in these diagrams than the conventional view until now ."
