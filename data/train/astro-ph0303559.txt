    "classical  local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) , plane - parallel , horizontally homogeneous , hydrostatic equilibrium  model stellar atmospheres have been providing a basic tool for stellar spectroscopy for several decades , but are now known to suffer from various weaknesses when applied to accurate observations of individual stars .",
    "several lines of research have been adopted to improve the models .",
    "for example , in the context of late - type stars , we mention here three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of surface convection ( e.g. stein & nordlund 1998 , asplund et al .",
    "2000 ) ; improvements in molecular opacities ( e.g. hauschildt et al . 1999a",
    "; tsuji 2002 ) ; the adoption of spherical geometry ( e.g. plez , brett , & nordlund 1992 ; hauschildt et al .",
    "1999b ) ; and semi - empirical modeling ( e.g. allende prieto et al . 2000 ) .",
    "lte has been one of the strongest hypotheses invoked extensively in solving the coupled problems of radiative transfer and structure in stellar atmospheres .",
    "this assumption enormously simplifies the complexity of the calculations , since the populations of all ions and molecules involved follow from the boltzmann and saha formulae . yet",
    ", lte has been recognized to be inappropriate in many areas of the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "models that take departures from lte into account are traditionally labeled non - lte ( or nlte ) models .",
    "the main area where the nlte models have been applied are hot stars ( types o , b , a , hot white dwarfs and subdwarfs , and other objects with high - temperature atmospheres ; see , e.g. , hubeny & lanz 1995 ) .",
    "however , the advent of large telescopes with high - dispersion spectrographs , and the subsequent refinement of observations of late - type stars , call for an assessment of the possible departures from lte on the model atmospheres for these stars .",
    "non - lte calculations require detailed radiative and collisional rates of all involved transitions in order to solve the statistical equilibrium equations .",
    "the role of photoionization cross - sections should be emphasized , because changes of the degree of ionization ( with respect to the lte ionization equilibrium ) are a major non - lte effect in stellar atmospheres .",
    "not all of the required energies and cross - sections for the atomic / molecular processes that play a role in a stellar atmosphere are available .",
    "nonetheless , the available data has been expanded in recent years .",
    "large collaborative projects , such as the opacity project ( see , e.g. , cunto et al .",
    "1993 ) , the iron project ( see , e.g. butler 1998 ) , and sam ( see , e.g. brage , judge , & brekke 1996 ) have been enormously helpful .",
    "long - term efforts on compilation of data , such as chianti ( e.g , dere et al .",
    "1997 ) , vald ( kupka et al . 1999 ) , and the atomic spectroscopic database ( asd ) at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , suplemented by numerous contributions from individuals and small groups , are to be noted .",
    "the model atoms presented here are built for use in the model stellar atmosphere code tlusty ( hubeny 1988 , hubeny  & lanz 1995 ) .",
    "a family of model atoms and ions , primarily in the context of hot stellar atmospheres , has been made publicly available with the code .",
    "these models are briefly described in  2 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the new set of model atoms , describing the numerical details of the smoothing process applied to the photoionization cross - sections , and the construction of model atoms .",
    "some comments on the limitations and practicalities for using these data , as well as a summary , are outlined in  4 .",
    "in the context of hot stellar atmospheres , a collection of model atoms for , , ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and  was prepared , ranging from very simple to quite complete structures .",
    "these models are essentially based on data extracted from topbase . to manipulate these large sets of atomic data , an interactive , idl - based tool , was developed : modion ( varosi et al . 1995 ; see also lanz et al .",
    "this interface program works with three files for each ion , containing the level energies , the line oscillator strengths , and the photoionization cross - sections , as extracted from topbase .",
    "the energy files have been updated with observed energies extracted from asd / nist ( martin 1997 ; wiese 1997 ) , so that all transitions will be calculated at their actual frequency .",
    "modion allows model atoms of various sophistication to be built by displaying a grotrian diagram from which the explicit nlte levels are interactively selected . although it might seem desirable to include as many levels as possible , this is often impracticable due to computing time and memory limitations . to overcome these limitations , some individual levels",
    "are merged into superlevels ( see hubeny  & lanz 1995 ) .",
    "low - excitation levels are generally considered as individual levels , while levels of higher excitation are merged .",
    "the most excited levels are often not treated explicitly , but are assumed to be in lte with respect to the ground state of the next ion .",
    "model atoms and ions have been built for different purposes : simple model atoms ( typically less than 15 explicit levels ) are often quite appropriate for inclusion in photospheric structure calculations , while very detailed models ( over 40 explicit levels ) may be required for detailed line formation studies .",
    "after the level selection step , modion builds a list of bound - bound and bound - free transitions .",
    "oscillator strengths from topbase are assigned to bound - bound transitions between individual levels .",
    "modion takes care of the appropriate summing and averaging for transitions between superlevels , supplementing topbase data with hydrogenic values when data are missing .",
    "the necessary sums are similarly performed for photoionization cross - sections .",
    "tlusty is able to deal with detailed and complex representations of the cross - sections , but in most cases we use approximate , yet adequate , representations . using modion , we display the cross - sections in a @xmath0 plot of the photoionization cross - section vs. frequency , and hand - pick some points with a cursor .",
    "the approximate cross - sections are selected to be the lower envelopes of the detailed cross - sections , thus the autoionization resonances are mostly neglected .",
    "finally , when the selections have been completed , modion writes out a data file in the format required by tlusty .",
    "some limited upgrades have been made in a later stage to incorporate stark profiles for strong resonance lines or to introduce fine - structure in strong resonance doublets like @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "this new set of model atoms is , like the modion models , based on data from topbase and nist .",
    "they treat , however , the photoionization cross - sections differently , and in more detail . as they are new and have never been used in calculations of radiative transfer and model atmospheres before , we describe them in depth .",
    "these models are , at the time of this writing , available for neutral na and s , singly ionized ne , and neutral and singly - ionized li , be , b , c , n , o , f , mg , al , si and ca .      it has been acknowledged that errors in the computed energies of the atomic levels may result in spurious shifts of the frequencies at which strong photoionization resonances are predicted by theoretical calculations .",
    "consequently , several authors have suggested different procedures to smooth the opacity project data ( see , e.g. , verner et al .",
    "1996 ; bautista , romano , & pradhan 1998 ) . in addition , smoothing the cross - sections reduces sometimes the number of data points to a more manageable level .",
    "bautista et al ( 1998 ) suggest a recipe for a convenient gaussian smoothing .",
    "they recommend a value for the width of the gaussian of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the energy of the ionizing photon .",
    "they apply such a smoothing to the photoionization cross - sections of ground levels of all atoms and ions included in topbase and to new data on @xmath5 provided by the iron project , producing resonance - averaged photoionization ( rap ) cross - sections . while in low - density environments , such as gaseous nebulae ,",
    "virtually all atoms and ions are in ground states , this is not the case for stellar atmospheres . extending the calculations of rap cross - sections to the rest of the levels is therefore desirable .",
    "we deal with neutral and singly - ionized species of the elements included in topbase that have been described by @xmath6 coupling in asd / nist , excluding h and fe .",
    "in fact , the list covers most of the atomic species of relevance for studying late - type stellar atmospheres .",
    "we have closely followed the procedure described by bautista et al .",
    "the rap cross - section at a given energy , @xmath7 , is computed from the topbase photoionization cross - section , @xmath8 , through the integral    @xmath9 } dx}{\\displaystyle \\int_{e_0}^{\\infty } { \\displaystyle   \\exp \\left [ \\frac{-(x - e)^2}{2 ( \\delta e)^2 } \\right ] }    dx}\\ ] ]    where @xmath10 is the ionization threshold energy , and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath10 is slightly lower than the energy difference between the level and the continuum , due to line merging near the series limit .        to speed up the calculations , without losing accuracy , we restricted the limits of the integral ( 1 ) to @xmath12 . in order to avoid unwanted systematic effects at the minimum ( threshold ) and maximum energies in the topbase calculations , we performed a linear interpolation over the energies for which less than five points were available within @xmath13 .",
    "the rap cross - sections were derived at energies separated by the smallest steps allowed by the sampling theorem , using the recurrence formula @xmath14 from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "figure 1 shows two examples corresponding to the ground levels of , and : the thin solid line corresponds to the original cross - sections , and the filled dots represent the rap cross - sections .",
    "the following sections describe how radiative and collisional processes are accounted for in the the rap model atoms .",
    "only collisions with electrons are included .",
    "collisions with neutral h atoms may be important in late - type stars , but lacking term - dependent or species - dependent data , they are not considered in these models .",
    "the phenomenological approximations usually found in the literature are best implemented directly in the nlte codes , rather than in the input data files .",
    "the opacity project provides energies and oscillator strengths for atomic levels and radiative transitions among them .",
    "however , even though this database provides a large amount of atomic data of sufficient quality for many purposes , theoretical calculations can not , with few exceptions , predict the energies of the levels with accuracy . as a result",
    ", the wavelengths of the lines can not be predicted to the precision available to laboratory spectroscopists .",
    "there are also measurements of transition probabilities that may be more accurate than those in the op database .",
    "we have chosen to use the atomic energy levels and the spectral lines included in asd / nist , version 2.0 , to build models for the same atoms and singly - ionized ions for which the have derived rap cross - sections from topbase data .",
    "the photoionization cross - sections are given as a function of the energy from the threshold , and therefore they are simply shifted to the observed energy levels .",
    "topbase ignores fine structure , and so have we , by grouping the split levels into a single one with an averaged energy , using @xmath17 as weights ( where j is the quantum number that represents the total angular momentum ) , according to the relative populations of the levels expected in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "transitions between fine - structure states of a given level are ignored .",
    "a scaled hydrogenic photoionization cross - section has been assigned to the levels whose photoionization cross - sections were not listed in topbase , assuming that the ionization takes place to the ground state of the next ion :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is planck s constant , @xmath20 is the quantum principal number of the last electron in the configuration , @xmath21 the frequency , @xmath22 the charge of the ion ( i.e. , @xmath23 for neutrals , @xmath24 for once ionized , etc . ) , and @xmath25 the gaunt factor expressed as    @xmath26    with the coefficients @xmath27 given by mihalas , heasley , & auer ( 1975 ) .",
    "units are used throughout the paper .",
    "the radiative transitions between fine - structure states ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) of two levels ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) have been summed to a single one with a @xmath32-value :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 represents the statistical weight of a fine structure level .    allowed and forbidden radiative transitions whose @xmath35-values are listed in the nist database have been included in the models . also ,",
    "allowed radiative transitions not listed in nist have been included , assuming a scaled hydrogenic transition probability    @xmath36    when more than one level in topbase  with separate photoionization cross - sections ",
    "was listed with identical energies in the nist lists , they were included in the models with their respective rap cross - sections .",
    "the states described in the nist database with a coupling other than @xmath6 have not been included , but states with configurations , terms , or energies listed as uncertain are included when matched by the topbase states within 0.08 ryd .",
    "only levels with energies lower than the series limit are kept . as an example ,",
    "figure 2 displays the grotrian diagrams for and . table 1 lists the number of levels and radiative transitions considered for each model .",
    "we have formatted the described data to be read by the program tlusty .",
    "the code is designed to build non - lte model atmospheres , and it will be the tool we shall employ in future analyses of stellar spectra .",
    "there are several documents explaining the data format in detail ( hubeny 1988 ; hubeny & lanz 1997 ) , hence we shall not describe it here . in the files , a series of _ options _ that apply to the solution of the statistical equilibrium equations have been chosen .",
    "these options set several input parameters ( e.g. collisional ionization and excitation , depth - dependency of the line absorption profiles , etc . ) , which are briefly described below , but they can be changed at ease by the user ( see hubeny 1988 ) .",
    "free - free absorption for metals is accounted for by a hydrogenic cross - section with the gaunt factor set to one , while the exact gaunt factors are used for h and he ii . the line absorption profiles are assumed gaussian and depth - independent .",
    "all levels are connected with each other and with the continuum by collisions with electrons .",
    "how these collisional processes are treated is described in more detail below .",
    "mostly , but not all , applies as well to the modion models .      the collisional rate for the transition @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number density of electrons and @xmath40 is the excitation rate coefficient .",
    "excitations induced by electron collisions between states connected by radiatively permitted transitions are accounted for using van regemorter s formula ( van regemorter 1962 , mihalas 1972 ) , with the excitation rate coefficient as :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the bohr radius , @xmath43 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath44 is the mass of the electron , @xmath45 is the threshold ionization energy for hydrogen , @xmath46 is the electron temperature , @xmath47 , and for ions    @xmath48\\ ] ]    with @xmath49 ( transitions between levels with the same principal quantum number ) or @xmath50 ( otherwise ) ( mihalas 1978 ) , @xmath51 is the first - order exponential integral , but for neutral atoms    @xmath52    ( auer & mihalas 1973 ) .",
    "collisional excitation between levels linked by forbidden radiative transitions is considered by means of the eissner - seaton formula ( seaton 1962 ) :    @xmath53    adopting , @xmath54 for all cases .",
    "pradhan & peng ( 1995 ) and pradhan & zhang ( 2000 ) review some of the detailed calculations and scaling laws of effective collisional strengths that are available for particular ions .",
    "those data should update the approximate values adopted here .",
    "we also used an approximate formula ( seaton 1962 ) to evaluate collisional ionizations :    @xmath55    with the photo - ionization cross - section at the threshold ( @xmath56 ) from topbase cross - sections ( when available ) , or the hydrogenic approximation ( with the gaunt factor equal to one )    @xmath57    where @xmath20 is again the principal quantum number of the last electron and @xmath22 the charge of the ion .",
    "collisional recombinations and de - excitations follow from the principle of detailed balance .",
    "detailed calculations should replace these approximate values where available ( see , e.g. , nahar & pradhan 1997 and nahar 1999 ) .",
    "we have smoothed the photoionization cross - sections of the opacity project for neutral na and s , singly ionized ne , and neutral and singly - ionized li , be , b , c , n , o , f , mg , al , si and ca , using a gaussian profile with @xmath58 , where @xmath4 is the energy of the ionizing photon .",
    "this procedure follows bautista et al .",
    "the smoothed cross - sections have been merged with the energy levels and line transition probabilities listed in the atomic and spectroscopic database at nist to derive model atoms and ions suitable for non - lte calculations of model atmospheres and line formation .",
    "this new collection of model atoms complements and , for the species in common , supersedes a previous dataset , the modion model atoms , developed for early - type stellar atmospheres .    as an example",
    ", we show the results of two calculations involving the rap models .",
    "figure 3 shows the relative importance of neutral c , n , o , and mg on the continuum absorption in the near - uv spectrum of the sun ( @xmath59 k ; @xmath60 dex ; [ fe / h]=0.0 dex ) and procyon ( @xmath61 k ; @xmath62 dex ; [ fe / h]=0.0 dex ) .",
    "the spectral synthesis assumes lte and makes use of kurucz s atmospheric structures ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "although the models are based on observed energy levels and lines , together with detailed calculations of photoionization cross - sections , judging their appropriateness for non - lte calculations in stellar atmospheres is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "several approximations and simplifications are implicit in the models and , therefore , caution is required .",
    "only detailed comparison with high quality observed spectra will determine the models usefulness .",
    "more complex ions not yet included in topbase are of interest .",
    "iron is at the head of this group , and new calculations of photoionization cross - sections are available ( bautista 1997 )  but not as part of topbase at the time of this writing .",
    "many other sources of data , although with a significant heterogeneity , exist and should be used to complement , check , and improve these models . such tasks and a detailed comparison with high - quality observations for a series of standard stars are in progress and will be reported in the future .",
