    "/lat was also observing during both  epochs but did not detect the source .",
    "we analyzed the `` pass@xmath37 '' data with the fermi science tools v9r31p1 and the p7source_v6 version of the instrument response functions , and using the public galactic diffuse model and the isotropic spectral template available at http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov / ssc/. for each epoch , we selected all the events within a region of interest ( roi ) with a radius of 10@xmath11 around the position of the grb , excluding times when any part of the roi was at a zenith angle @xmath12 .",
    "the latter requirement greatly reduces contamination from the diffuse gamma - ray emission originating from the earth s upper atmosphere , peaking at a zenith angle of @xmath2110@xmath13 .      for each epoch",
    "we performed an unbinned likelihood analysis over the whole energy range ( 0.1@xmath3@xmath3100@xmath3gev ) , using a model composed of the two background components ( galactic and isotropic ) and a point source with a power - law ( pl ) spectrum ( the grb ) , plus the contribution from all the known gamma - ray point sources in the roi @xcite .",
    "we did not obtain a detection in either epoch , and so we computed upper limits ( uls ) .",
    "we froze the normalization of the background components , and fixed the photon index of the grb model to @xmath14 , which is the best fit value from the smoothly - broken power - law ( sbpl ) fit during the first  epoch as reported in ",
    "@xmath3[sec : broadband ] ( the uls change by less than 10% for any choice of the photon index between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "we then independently fit the grb model in 3 energy bands ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19gev ) , using an unbinned profile likelihood method to derive the corresponding 95% lat uls @xcite .",
    "the information contained in such uls is important to constrain the spectrum , but can not be handled by a standard fitting procedure .",
    "we , therefore , turn to an alternative ( but equivalent ) method to include the lat observations in a broadband spectral fit .",
    "we obtained the count spectrum of the observed lat signal ( source+background ) using _ gtbin _ , and the background spectrum using _ gtbkg _ , which computes the predicted counts from all the components of the best fit likelihood model except the grb . since there is no significant excess above the background , the two spectra are compatible within the errors , although they are not identical",
    ". we also ran _ gtrspgen _ to compute the response of the instrument in the interval of interest , and loaded these files in xspec@xmath3v.12.7 .",
    "this software compares the observed net counts to the number of counts predicted by the model folded with the response of the instrument . by minimizing a statistic based on the poisson probability",
    "we can treat equivalently a spectrum containing a significant signal , and a spectrum which is compatible with being just background .",
    "while the former will constrain the model to pass through the data points , the latter will constrain it to predict a number of counts above background compatible with zero .",
    "the best - fit model obtained using the lat spectra computed in this way is , as expected , below the uls computed with the profile likelihood method .",
    "the high - energy ( @xmath7mev ) photon and energy flux lightcurves are well described by a broken power law ( bpl ) and pl , respectively , as reported in @xcite . to extrapolate such lightcurves to the  epochs we adopted a general approach , based on the well - known markov chain monte carlo technique , which takes into account the uncertainties on the best fit parameters along with all their correlations , as follows .",
    "each data point in fig.@xmath3[fig : lat ] represents a photon flux derived from a likelihood fit with 1@xmath10 confidence intervals @xcite .",
    "hence , we can assume a gaussian joint likelihood @xmath20 and minimize the corresponding @xmath21 to find the best - fit parameters , which is equivalent to a standard least - squares fit ( or to minimize @xmath22 ) .",
    "we can then apply the bayes rule that the posterior distribution for the parameters is directly proportional to the prior distribution multiplied by the likelihood .",
    "if we take an uninformative prior , then the posterior distribution is directly proportional to the likelihood itself .",
    "therefore , sampling the likelihood function with a markov chain monte carlo technique is equivalent to sampling the posterior distribution . by using _",
    "e.g. , _ the @xcite algorithm , we can then obtain many sets of parameters distributed as in the posterior distribution , with all the relations between them taken into account . using these sets of parameters , @xmath23",
    ", we can build a distribution of a certain quantity of interest @xmath24 . taking the median and the relevant percentiles of the distribution we",
    "can then extract a measure of @xmath25 and its 1@xmath10 confidence interval . in this way",
    ", we computed the shaded region in fig.@xmath3[fig : lat ] and the expected flux only in the first  epoch , which starts shortly after the last detection from /lat .",

    "only data points used for the bpl fit ( i.e. , after @xmath26s ) are included . ]",
    "we extracted lightcurves and spectra during the  epochs from /ultra - violet / optical telescope ( uvot ) , and /xrt using the standard heasoft reduction pipelines and the /xrt team repository @xcite , as well as liverpool telescope data using in - house software @xcite .",
    "for the first epoch , we compare the extrapolation of the lat temporal and spectral behavior @xcite to our multi - wavelength lightcurves and spectra .",
    "fig.@xmath3[fig : sed ] shows two spectral energy distributions ( seds ) spanning from optical ( i band ) to @xmath6-rays ( @xmath2gev ) .",
    "we first fit both epochs independently ( excluding /lat data ) with two functional forms ( table  1 )  single pl and bpl  each multiplied by models for both fixed galactic and free intrinsic ( host ) extinction ( zdust ) and absorption ( phabs ) , respectively , and a free cross - calibration constant .",
    "we find that both epochs can be fit with a pl ; however , the second epoch fit is better ( @xmath27 versus 1.08 for the first epoch ) . for the first epoch",
    "a bpl is significantly better , with an f - test - value of 19.1 ( chance probability @xmath28 , see also table  1 ) .",
    "we then fit the first epoch only with a physically motivated sbpl spectrum described in @xcite , with a fixed sharpness of the break , @xmath29 , and including the broadband lat ul .",
    "we performed two fits : ( i ) keeping the two power - law indices free , and ( ii ) requiring them to differ by @xmath30 according to the synchrotron radiation theoretical expectation @xcite .",
    "the sbpl fit was better ( table  1 ) and is shown at the top panel of fig.@xmath3[fig : sed ] , together with the lat uls , as well as the extrapolation of the lat lightcurve to this epoch ; the extrapolation was not used in the fit but plotted for comparison with the model .",
    "both are consistent with the sbpl fit ",
    "the curvature in the  data is also clearly exhibited in the inset in the top panel .",
    "the lower panel shows the sed with the second  epoch fit with a pl and with the first epoch fit shifted and superposed on the plot ; although the data do not constrain such a fit , they are consistent with it .",
    "finally , we performed broadband fits removing the  data ( including only optical , /xrt , /uvot data , and /lat uls ) and found that the break energies could not be constrained .",
    "therefore , the  data are _ essential in constraining the shape of the broadband spectra_.    our results are broadly consistent with those of @xcite who derived radio to gev afterglow spectra of grb@xmath3130427a covering @xmath31days after trigger .",

    "such an eruption might also account for a variable external density profile , where a transition from a flatter profile to a steeper one might be responsible for the steepening of the optical - to - x - ray lightcurves after several hours @xcite .",
    "the density profile might have been relatively steep ( @xmath62 ) during the first few hundred seconds , shortly after the outflow deceleration time , possibly accounting for the early reverse shock emission @xcite .",
    "the  power - law distributions in time and frequency support an afterglow synchrotron origin @xcite .",
    "synchrotron radiation models predict a maximum synchrotron photon energy , @xmath63 , derived by equating the electron acceleration and synchrotron radiative cooling timescales , assuming a single acceleration and emission region @xcite . in the context of late - time /lat",
    "high - energy photons , this was first briefly mentioned as a problem for a synchrotron origin for grb090902b @xcite , and later discussed more generally and in depth by @xcite .",
    "the long - lasting ( @xmath21@xmath3day ) /lat afterglow included a 32@xmath3gev photon after 34@xmath3ks , and altogether five @xmath430@xmath3gev photons after @xmath4200@xmath3s .",
    "all five significantly exceed @xmath63 , by factors of 625 for @xmath60 , and 920 for @xmath61 ( using eq.@xmath3(4 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "this led to suggestions that the /lat high - energy photons were not synchrotron radiation , but instead arose from a distinct high - energy spectral component @xcite .",
    "such a component may arise for example , from synchrotron self - compton @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was predicted to dominate at high photon energies at late times @xcite , but has rarely been detected in the late x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "other possible origins of the high - energy emission involve long - lived activity of the central source , producing a late relativistic outflow that provides seed synchrotron photons or relativistic electrons that might scatter either their own synchrotron emission or that of the afterglow shock @xcite . in grb@xmath3130427a , however , there are no signs of prolonged central source activity ( such as x - ray flares ) beyond hundreds of seconds .",
    "another option is a `` pair echo '' involving tev photons emitted promptly by the grb , which pair - produce with photons of the extragalactic background light ; for low enough intergalactic magnetic fields the resulting pairs can produce detectable longer - lived gev emission by up - scattering cosmic microwave background photons @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the flux decay rate is expected to gradually steepen and the photon index to soften , in contrast with observations .",
    "a different possibility is pair cascades , induced by shock - accelerated ultra - high - energy cosmic rays @xcite .    for any of these alternative models to work , there needs to be a transition from synchrotron emission ( at low photon energies ) to the alternative model ( at high energies ) .",
    "we expect that if a distinct spectral component dominated the emission at gev energies , it would naturally show up in a broad - band sed . by combining optical , xrt ,  and /lat ul data",
    ", we have shown that the sed at @xmath21.5@xmath3days is perfectly consistent with the theoretically expected sbpl spectral shape from optical to gev energies , without any unaccounted - for flux , and that the flux at all these energies decays at a similar rate .",
    "this strongly suggests a single underlying spectral component over a wide energy range . for low energies ,",
    "the most viable emission mechanism for such a spectral component is synchrotron radiation , suggesting that the entire sed is produced by synchrotron emission .",
    "therefore , our results strongly suggest that the late - time /lat",
    "high - energy photons in grb@xmath3130427a are indeed afterglow synchrotron radiation , and provide the strongest direct observational support to date for such an afterglow synchrotron origin of late - time @xmath410@xmath3gev /lat photons . as was already pointed out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such an origin challenges particle acceleration models in afterglow shocks .",
    "in particular , at least one of the assumptions in estimating @xmath64 must be incorrect , requiring a modification of our understanding of afterglow shock physics . while many authors were aware of this potential problem ,",
    "the nustar results make it much harder to circumvent .",
    "one possible solution may lie in changing the assumption of a uniform magnetic field into a lower magnetic field acceleration region and a higher magnetic field synchrotron radiation region @xcite .",
    "these might arise for diffusive shock acceleration ( fermi type  i ) if the tangled shock - amplified magnetic field decays on a short length scale behind the shock front ( where most of the high - energy radiation is emitted ) , while the highest energy electrons are accelerated in the lower magnetic field further downstream @xcite .",
    "another possibility is direct linear acceleration in the electric field of magnetic reconnection layers , which have a low magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this would require , however , a significant fraction of the total energy in the flow to reside in magnetic fields of alternating sign .",
    "this is not expected in grb afterglows , but it could occur in the magnetic - reconnection induced decay of the tangled shock - amplified field mentioned above , which initially reaches near - equipartition values just behind the shock . while the exact solution is still unclear , our results provide an important challenge for our understanding of particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in relativistic shocks ."
