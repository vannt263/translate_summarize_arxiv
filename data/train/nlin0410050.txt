    "the cascade of energy to low wavenumbers in two - dimensional turbulence @xcite , more than other turbulence problems , is suited to the standard methods of statistical field theory and the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "these methods @xcite , originating in quantum field theory , show that arbitrary short - distance interactions lead to long - distance behavior described by a local , renormalizable action  an effective field theory .",
    "correlation functions computed from this action contain ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences that can be eliminated by redefining the parameters and fields .",
    "the divergences leave their mark , however , in the dependence on the renormalization scale and the resulting anomalous scaling laws .",
    "the classic application of statistical field theory is to critical phenomena ( second - order phase transitions ) in condensed matter @xcite .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) scale invariance of correlation functions at the transition temperature is explained by a fixed point of the rg flow . the inverse energy cascade of two - dimensional turbulence is likewise believed to be nearly scale invariant , and one might suspect that a similar fixed point is responsible .",
    "we will see , however , that no fixed point can reproduce the observed @xmath4 energy spectrum .",
    "rather , we will argue that the inverse cascade arises from a nontrivial rg flow and thus is not expected to be completely scale invariant .    in the study of turbulence , a deviation from scale invariance ( a dependence of dimensionless physical quantities on scale )",
    "is referred to as intermittency @xcite . while intermittency is recognized as a property of the three - dimensional direct cascade of energy , its existence in the two - dimensional inverse cascade is unsettled . for a nonstationary inverse cascade ,",
    "in which energy is not dissipated but progresses to ever - lower wavenumbers , intermittency is not observed in numerical simulations @xcite ; a theoretical explanation has been given @xcite . in this paper",
    "we deal solely with the stationary regime , where an inverse cascade requires a low - wavenumber energy sink . with few exceptions , simulations of such a cascade confirm the @xmath4 energy spectrum initially predicted @xcite on the basis of scale invariance .",
    "but one set of simulations @xcite finds strong intermittency in fourth- and higher - order velocity correlations .",
    "other simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite , though , find no significant intermittency .",
    "the various studies differ mainly in the precise form of the dissipation terms .",
    "the evidence suggests that intermittency in the stationary inverse cascade , permitted by our theory , is at least possibly realized .",
    "it is our restricted focus on the inverse cascade that allows us to work with a purely local field theory .",
    "the random force that stirs the fluid is correlated over a limited range and is effectively local in a long - distance description . as with the rg treatment of quantum fields and condensed matter",
    ", we expect all short - distance details to become irrelevant except as they are manifested in local , renormalizable couplings . the two - dimensional direct cascade of enstrophy to high wavenumbers @xcite thus falls outside our scope . a previous rg analysis of two - dimensional turbulence @xcite is formally similar to ours ,",
    "but it follows three - dimensional studies by adopting the long - range force correlations necessary for a direct cascade ; even its derivation of the inverse cascade relies on nonlocal forcing .",
    "here we apply rg methods in the familiar domain of local field theory , which should allow a physical treatment of the inverse cascade .",
    "the explanation of the direct enstrophy cascade may rest on entirely different foundations , such as conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "the work most closely aligned with our theoretical approach is due to forster , nelson , and stephen ( fns ) @xcite . at the technical level ,",
    "our contribution is to add linear friction to fns model a in @xmath5 and compute the rg flow to the next order of perturbation theory , two loops .",
    "the inclusion of friction , which dissipates energy at low wavenumbers , makes our theory capable in principle of describing the inverse cascade and its @xmath4 spectrum  unlike fns model a , which gives a @xmath6 spectrum corresponding to energy equipartition in @xmath5 .",
    "we also note a difference in our viewpoint from that of fns and others @xcite who apply rg methods to turbulence by analogy with critical phenomena .",
    "these authors seek a controlled ir - stable fixed point by starting with a logarithmically divergent field theory and then decreasing the dimension of space or the exponent of the stirring - force correlation by @xmath7 .",
    "this adds to the @xmath0 function a negative linear term proportional to @xmath7 . with the usual positive one - loop term",
    ", there exists an ir - stable fixed point at a coupling that goes to zero with @xmath7 ; the fixed - point theory can then be expanded in @xmath7 instead of the original coupling . like fns , we work in @xmath8 to regulate uv divergences , but we ultimately take @xmath9 , so that the fixed point is trivial . our inverse - cascade model lies not at a fixed point but in the region of large dimensionless coupling .    naturally the use of perturbation theory is questionable for strong coupling .",
    "our perturbative results will have direct quantitative application only to the extreme ir limit controlled by the trivial fixed point , which is of some interest in itself .",
    "nevertheless , we will make reasonable conjectures about the theory s strong - coupling behavior that are consistent with the inverse cascade , bearing in mind the dangers of the nonperturbative regime .",
    "besides the concern with the numerical accuracy of extrapolations , there are fundamental difficulties at strong coupling .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of operators may be large , and the relevance of terms in the action may differ from the weak - coupling case .",
    "furthermore , at strong coupling , there is no simple relation between the couplings in different renormalization schemes , such as the wilsonian cutoff ( useful for physical interpretation ) and minimal subtraction ( convenient for systematic calculation ) .",
    "we may hope that these subtleties do not affect the main conclusions even at very strong coupling .",
    "at least we know that the theory of critical phenomena in @xmath10 is extrapolated to @xmath11 ( moderate coupling ) with acceptable results .    in sec",

    "the consequences of galilean invariance and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem have been systematically derived based on the underlying symmetries of the action . after taking these symmetries into account ,",
    "we have evaluated the necessary two - loop diagrams in dimensional regularization to obtain the two - loop @xmath0 function @xmath321 which is independent of the renormalization scheme to precisely this order .    because the anomalous dimensions vanish identically in minimal subtraction , no rg fixed point can yield the observed @xmath4 energy spectrum of the inverse cascade .",
    "instead , we have found that the inverse cascade could plausibly arise from nonperturbative strong - coupling effects in the presence of friction .",
    "the apparent anomalous dimension of the velocity must arise from the rapid rg flow of the coupling .",
    "cutoff independence of the energy dissipation rate ( or constancy of the energy flux ) requires the strong - coupling behavior @xmath322 and we have also obtained this in a heuristic way from a borel transformation of the two - loop @xmath0 function .",
    "the observed energy spectrum in the inertial range has been matched with perturbative results at the wavenumbers where dissipation becomes important .",
    "inertial - range intermittency ( violation of scale invariance ) is generically expected because the coupling flows rapidly with scale , but the evidence on intermittency from numerical simulations is mixed . on the other hand ,",
    "a similar rg analysis of the one - dimensional burgers equation confirms the simpler behavior of that model , controlled by a strong - coupling fixed point .",
    "our greatest difficulty is that the inverse cascade appears to be intrinsically a nonperturbative phenomenon . to make quantitative predictions , such as the exponent of the energy spectrum or the value of the kolmogorov constant",
    ", it may be useful to combine a high - order perturbative calculation with an appropriate resummation method , as in our analysis of the strong - coupling @xmath0 function .",
    "of course evaluating additional diagrams with two or more loops will be very challenging , especially if the finite parts are needed . at the present stage ,",
    "the most intriguing prediction of our theory is that substantial intermittency should be expected in the stationary inverse cascade",
    ". it would be helpful to have more robust and consistent results from experiments and simulations to determine whether this expectation is realized , and if it is not , to identify the field - theoretic explanation .",
