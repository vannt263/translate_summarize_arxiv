    "the study of entanglement in quantum systems has been a major field of research in the last two decades .",
    "motivations for this are various and important since entanglement provides not only a characterization of quantum states @xcite and a pathway on how to simulate them with numerical tools such as dmrg @xcite and tensor network states @xcite , but it helps also to characterize quantum phase transitions @xcite and to detect novel quantum phases , including topological phases .",
    "non - trivial , explicit examples of the use of entanglement - related quantities , such as entanglement spectrum and negativity , range from quantum hall states @xcite to bose - hubbard @xcite and kondo models @xcite .",

    "@xcite for the ee refers to the fact that typically the ee grows as the boundary of the subsystem @xmath0 : i.e. , for a system in @xmath9 dimensions and a subsystem of size @xmath10 having volume @xmath11 and area @xmath12 , @xmath13 according of the area law @xcite .    the study of ee in various models has been recently a subject of intense research : ee can be explicitly computed in non - interacting systems of bosons and fermions @xcite , including trapped fermions @xcite , in integrable @xcite and 1d critical models @xcite , and in spin chains with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "an important result is that , for gapless @xmath14 integrable systems , the ee grows as @xmath15 , and that the prefactor is proportional to the central charge of the model .",
    "the next - leading term of the ee has been studied as well : e.g. , for @xmath16 systems the size - independent constant entering @xmath17 is the so - called topological ee @xcite .",

    "fermi liquids are expected to obey the area law while non - fermi liquids in @xmath16 , although have been shown to satisfy the area law , are at the border between area law and non - area law ee @xcite .",
    "a construction of a translation invariant fermionic state violating the area law was explicitly given in @xcite , when the fermi surface is a cantor - like set .",

    "an analysis of ee in spin chains having long - range interactions and a fractal fermi surface for the associated jordan - wigner fermions has been presented in @xcite : in particular in @xcite it was shown that ee for all translational - invariant pure states is at least logarithmic and there is an arbitrary fast sublinear entropy growth .",
    "states supporting an area law for the ee are not maximally entangled and yet maximally entangled states have been deeply studied both for their intrinsic interest and in connection to quantum information protocols : maximally multiqubit entangled states up to eight qubits in qubit registers were reported in @xcite , while applications of absolutely maximally entangled states ( i.e. , multipartite quantum states maximally entangled with respect to any possible bipartition ) to a variety of quantum information protocols , including quantum secret sharing schemes @xcite and open - destination teleportation protocols @xcite .    in this paper we show that a volume law for the ee of the ground state may emerge in fermionic lattices : to avoid ambiguities , we say that the a violation of the area law is obtained if , apart from logarithmic corrections , the ee scales as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . in particular , for @xmath14 chains , a violation of the area law corresponds to @xmath22 and for @xmath6 we have the volume law . to set the notation",

    "one might think that a volume law could emerge only as a result of introducing a long - range hopping matrix @xmath25 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "our analyses shows that this is not the case since , at least for translational invariant systems , it is rather the topology of the fermi surface which really matters , as also pointed out in previous analysis @xcite .",

    "[ sec : random ] we analyze the violation of the area law of the ground state for a free fermionic model which is not translational invariant .",
    "in this section we focus our attention on a translationally invariant one - dimensional chain , with non - local hopping matrix @xmath49 given by @xmath50 where the distance @xmath51 , due to periodic boundary conditions , is defined as @xmath52 the hopping matrix , being translationally invariant , is readily diagonalized : its eigenstates are given by plane waves and , in the thermodynamic limit , the energy spectrum is @xmath53 where @xmath54 belongs to the first brillouin zone ( @xmath55 for even @xmath24 ) and @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 ) . as usual , even if for @xmath58 the ground - state energy in the thermodynamic limit diverges , one can make the energy extensive by the so - called kac rescaling @xcite .    the function @xmath59 is plotted for two values of @xmath57 in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "one sees that the spectra are monotonic for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and , thus , the filling of the momentum eigenstates leading to the occupation of the fermi sea is the same for each value of @xmath57 .",
    "the same result holds also for @xmath62 for any finite number of sites ( appendix [ app : lrphase ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the ee does not change since the correlation matrix ( [ correl_intr ] ) depends only on the ground state ( and not on the spectrum ) ; in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath63 for each @xmath64 for any filling @xmath48 , just as it happens if the hopping @xmath25 was short range @xcite . a similar analysis , yielding the same results ,",
    "may be carried out also for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    "in addition , the fermi surface passes from a two - point set ( as it happens for @xmath64 ) to a continuous set . in appendix",
    "[ app : fcn ] we show that , for @xmath77 , @xmath78 ; \\label{s_fully}\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "this corresponds to an equal _ a priori _ probability of occupation of all degenerate states by the available particles .",
    "the fully connected hopping model does not have a specific dimensionality @xmath9 : however , if we think it as the @xmath81 limit of a @xmath9-dimensional long - range hopping model and @xmath0 is a cubic subsystem with size @xmath82 , then the number @xmath10 of sites of @xmath0 is given by @xmath83 .",
    "it appears as we already obtained a volume law for the ee .",
    "unfortunately , for the fully connected hopping model , the number of sites @xmath10 of the subsystem @xmath0 is at the same time the volume and the surface of @xmath0 in the sense that all the @xmath10 sites of @xmath0 are linked with the other sites of the rest of the system @xmath1 .",
    "in addition the mutual information between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is vanishing for @xmath77 and , thus , the emergence of a volume law corresponds here to nothing but the transition to a classical state .",
    "the analysis carried out in this section shows that , for translational invariant systems , long - range hoppings alone are not enough to guarantee the emergence of the volume law for the ee and it appears that the structure of the fermi surface is bound to play a key role in the behavior of the ee . in particular , for a translational invariant chain and a quadratic hamiltonian of the form , all the models having fermi wave vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 at the points @xmath86 of fig.[fig1 ] have the same correlation matrix , which , in the continuum limit , reads @xmath87 leading to the same ee ( we remind that our hamiltonian does not include any `` superconducting '' @xmath88 terms , that would change the correlation matrix ) . if @xmath89 then the well known result @xmath90 } / \\left [ \\pi \\left ( i - j \\right)\\right]$ ] of the nearest - neighbor free fermionic chain is recovered @xcite .    to better clarify the role played by the fermi surface",

    "as a result , the ee depends only on @xmath92 and not on other details of the energy spectrum .",
    "in order to elucidate the role played by the fermi surface for constructing a maximal entangled state in a translationally invariant free fermionic lattice , it is instructive to look at _ all _ the possible fermi surfaces arising in 1-dimensional systems of small size @xmath24 .",
    "this task is simplified if one notices that circular shifts ( @xmath96 ) and reflections ( @xmath97 ) of the fermi surface do not alter the ee . as a result",

    "the result is shown in fig.[fig2 ] for a system with @xmath98 sites at half - filling .",
    "as one can see , the fermi surfaces exhibiting the maximal ee are realized with an alternating filling of the wave vectors periodic in @xmath70-space with period @xmath99 , while fermi surfaces exhibiting higher periodicity in @xmath70-space , have a piecewise linear behavior .",
    "the minimal ee for a system of @xmath100 sites at half filling is achieved with a fermi surface made up of two points , i.e. made occupying @xmath101 states with adjacent wave vectors .",

    "of course , additional vectors will not give rise to nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath133 thus we can limit ourselves to @xmath147 i.e. we are determining @xmath107 up to vectors orthogonal to @xmath42 @xcite .",
