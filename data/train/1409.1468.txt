    "quantum non - markovianity ( nm ) is currently the focus of a widespread interest @xcite . until recently such concept  which is not as clear in the quantum realm as in classical physics  has been associated with any open dynamics which is not governed by the well - known kossakowski - lindblad master equation @xcite .",
    "such paradigm has been considerably refined in the last few years through various investigations , which put forward quantitative measures of nm ( see @xcite and references therein ) . here , we make use of these developments in order to shed light on the occurrence of nm in the emission process of a quantum emitter (  atom \" ) in a so - called half - cavity .",
    "such model consists of a two - level system coupled to the electromagnetic field in the presence of a single perfect mirror . by hypothesis ,",
    "the field is constrained to travel along a one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide .",
    "one can think of a semi - infinite waveguide whose termination behaves as an effective perfect mirror .",
    "such model was first studied in the 80s @xcite and , more recently , revisited and further developed in refs .",
    "studying nm in this system is especially interesting as the mirror clearly introduces a feedback mechanism , which can intuitively establish memory effects .",
    "one can however wonder whether or not these take place at any finite atom - mirror distance as well as if , and how , they are affected by interference phenomena occurring within the atom - mirror interspace .    in general , the emission process under study is quite complex @xcite .",
    "the atomic excitation probability amplitude can be worked out exactly , although in the form of a function series featuring a number of terms that grows with time .",
    "thereby a comprehensive analysis of nm , which will be the focus of an extensive publication @xcite , can not be attained in a fully analytical way .",
    "nevertheless , there is numerical evidence that many distinctive qualitative traits of nm can be captured @xcite even if one restricts the analysis to times that are shorter than @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the duration of a round trip over the atom - mirror path .",
    "in such a case , the aforementioned series reduces to two terms only and an analytical description can be carried out . in this short work ,",
    "we focus on such early stage of the time evolution ( @xmath2 ) and demonstrate the existence of a _ threshold _ separating the markovian and non - markovian regions as a function of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the spontaneous emission rate in the no - mirror case ) and @xmath5 , the latter being the phase shift corresponding two twice the atom - mirror optical path .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we present our model and review basic properties of the atomic emission process in a half - cavity . in section [ criterion ] , we describe the criterion we use to assess occurrence of nm . in section [ threshold ] , we show the existence of a threshold beyond which nm is exhibited .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we give our conclusions .",
    "we consider a two - level atom , with levels @xmath6 separated by the frequency @xmath7 , interacting with a 1d continuum of bosonic modes @xmath8 , such that @xmath9=\\delta(k\\!-\\!k')$ ] .",
    "let the atom be placed at @xmath10 , the @xmath11-axis being along the propagation direction of the field .",
    "we assume that the amplitude profile of the @xmath12-th mode is @xmath13 , which is equivalent to imposing the hard - wall boundary condition enforced by a perfect mirror lying at @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the group velocity of a photon ( we assume a linear photonic dispersion relation ) .",
    "as we work under the rotating wave approximation , the specific value of the cut - off wave vector @xmath19 is unimportant and hence we can make the approximation @xmath20 @xcite . in this paper , we study the evolution of an arbitrary atomic state when the field is initially in the vacuum state @xmath21 .",
    "since the ground state evolves trivially ( @xmath22 is an eigenstate of @xmath23 ) , we can focus on the evolution of the atomic excited state @xmath24 only .",
    "thus , at a time @xmath25 owing to conservation of the total number of excitations the joint atom - field wave function can be written as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the atomic excitation probability amplitude and @xmath28 is the single - photon amplitude in @xmath12-space . by imposing the time - dependent schrdinger equation , and eliminating the field modes in terms of @xmath27 ,",
    "one ends up with the delay differential equation @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the _ time delay _",
    ", @xmath31 is a phase ( optical path associated with @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 is the heaviside step function . for the initial condition @xmath35 the solution of eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) reads @xmath36 this suggests a natural splitting of the time - axis into intervals of duration @xmath0 . in the first of such intervals the series in eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) features only one term .",
    "when passing to the next interval , it acquires an extra term .",
    "it is easy to check that an arbitrary atomic initial state @xmath37 at a later time @xmath25 evolves into @xmath38",
    "to assess whether or not the emission dynamics exhibits nm , we use the following criterion based on the derivative of @xmath39 .",
    "this is best expressed as @xmath40 hence , nm takes place if and only if @xmath39 ( and in turn the atom s average energy ) grows at a some stage of the evolution .",
    "the use of such criterion is justified by the fact that it can be proven @xcite that an open dynamics of the form ( [ matrice ] ) is divisible if and only if @xmath41 at any time , where indivisibility is recognized as major trait of nm @xcite . moreover ,",
    "relevant and in general non - equivalent measures of nm , such as those in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the specific case of this dynamics vanish if and only condition ( [ cond ] ) holds .    in the process under study , at times @xmath42 no memory effect can take place since a photon is not able to complete one round - trip between the atom and mirror . indeed , ( [ eps ] ) yields @xmath43 thus fulfilling ( [ cond ] ) at any time @xmath44 [ 0,@xmath45",
    ". however , this may not be the case for @xmath46 . to carry out our analysis",
    ", we first note that condition ( [ cond ] ) is equivalent to the analogous condition @xmath47 .",
    "this , in the light of condition ( [ cond ] ) and with the help of eq .",
    "( [ de ] ) and its c.c .",
    ", entails that in our case the system is markovian iff @xmath48\\le0\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\forall\\,t\\geq t_d.\\label{cond2}\\ ] ]",
    "here , we focus on the conditions for occurrence of nm ( in terms of the relevant parameters entering our open dynamics ) in the first nontrivial time domain , namely @xmath50 $ ] . based on the previous section , in order to assess nm in the interval",
    "@xmath49 $ ] it is enough to analyze the time domain @xmath51 $ ] . for such times , eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) entails @xmath52\\,.\\ ] ] this and eq .  ( [ cond2 ] )",
    "then yield @xmath53 where we have set @xmath54 . here , the coefficients specifying the second - degree polynomial @xmath55 are given by @xmath56 as the factor multiplying @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ px ] ) is always negative , we see that the condition @xmath57 for any @xmath58 is equivalent to @xmath59\\,.\\label{cond3}\\ ] ] if eq .",
    "( [ cond3 ] ) holds then , in particular , it must be @xmath60 . also , note that since @xmath61 for any @xmath62 the parabola @xmath55 is convex . in virtue of these considerations , we see that eq .",
    "( [ cond3 ] ) is fulfilled iff one of the following conditions holds    * \\(i ) @xmath63 and @xmath64 , * \\(ii ) @xmath63 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , * \\(iii ) @xmath63 , @xmath65 and @xmath67 ,    where @xmath68 is the discriminant of the second - degree equation @xmath69 , while @xmath70 are the two real roots of @xmath55 ( when @xmath71 ) . through elementary calculations @xmath72 by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ c0 ] ) and ( [ delta ] ) it is easy to check that @xmath64 implies @xmath63 , so that ( i ) reduces to the simple inequality @xmath73 .",
    "+ let us now address condition ( ii ) . the requirements @xmath63 and @xmath65",
    "imply that it must be @xmath74 and @xmath75 . by imposing @xmath66",
    ", we find the further constraint @xmath76 . + as for ( iii ) , the previous considerations for ( ii ) hold unchanged except the condition on the root which is to be replaced with @xmath67 .",
    "this results in the inequalities @xmath77 and @xmath78-{\\rm e}^{-\\gamma t_d/2}$ ] .    in fig .",
    "[ faiga ] , we display the three domains ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) in the parameter space @xmath5-@xmath3 ( each region is intended as the domain within which the corresponding condition is fulfilled ) .",
    "nm occurs at points which do not lie within any of the three domains .",
    "the threshold ( blue thick line ) separating the two regimes stems from the three domains ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "[ faiga ] ]    by looking at fig .",
    "1 , it is thus evident that the three domains in fact define a threshold in the parameter space separating the markovian region from the non - markovian one ( thick line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "remarkably , the threshold value of @xmath3 beyond which nm is exhibited turns out to depend crucially on the phase @xmath5 , hence witnessing occurrence of significant interference phenomena .    as observed in the introduction , despite being limited to the early stage of the evolution ,",
    "the above finding can be shown to capture some qualitative features arising from the analysis of the full evolution @xcite ( the latter is clearly demanded for a comprehensive and conclusive study of nm ) . intuitively , this is is because the time interval that we considered here is long enough for the system to exhibit crucial phenomena such as retardation , feedback and interference .",
    "notwithstanding , some _ general _ conclusions ( on the entire dynamics ) based on our outcomes can be given .",
    "indeed , a look at ( [ cond ] ) should make clear that the condition that we found for occurrence of nm in terms of @xmath3 at a set value of @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 and related discussion ) is a _ sufficient _ one with respect to the entire time evolution .",
    "hence , we conclude that the threshold arising from the full dynamics ( if any ) is upper bounded by the one in fig .  1 . in particular , two general properties can be established . first , for @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is an integer number ) the system is certainly non - markovian _ regardless of @xmath3 _ ( no threshold ) .",
    "such feature is physically reasonable since it can be shown that these values of @xmath5 are the only ones for which an atom - photon bound state is formed @xcite .",
    "second , nm surely occurs _ independently of @xmath5 _ when @xmath81 .",
    "this is indeed the maximum value of @xmath3 along the threshold , which occurs for @xmath82 ( and even integer multiples of it , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we investigated the occurrence of nm for a two - level atom emitting in a 1d photonic waveguide in the presence of a perfect mirror . as a reliable criterion for assessing nm",
    ", we used the negativity of the time derivative of the atomic excitation probability .",
    "the study of nm has been limited to the early stage of the evolution , which allows to carry out most calculations analytically .",
    "we found the emergence of a threshold separating the markovian and non - markovian regions in the space of physical parameters . based on this",
    ", we were able to highlight some properties concerning the full open dynamics .",
