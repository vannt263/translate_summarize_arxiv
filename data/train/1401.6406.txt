    "shallow water theory has been widely applied to the jovian atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the cloud deck is treated as a homogeneous layer separated from a much deeper and relatively quiescent lower layer by a sharp density contrast , which may be linked to the latent heat released by water vapour condensing at this depth .",

    "simulations of the latter model without height damping produce a sub - rotating equatorial jet .",
    "the global qg forms of the three different shallow water models produce equatorial jets in the same directions as their parent models .",
    "the mechanism responsible for setting the direction of equatorial jets must therefore lie within qg theory , which justifies our subsequent neglect of the inertia - gravity , kelvin and yanai waves .",

    "a key difference is that the mean zonal accelerations at the equator calculated by @xcite were always westward ( @xmath34 in the notation of  [ sect : mom ] ) and so could not explain the formation of super - rotating equatorial jets .",
    "however , @xcite studied the limit of large vertical wavenumber for waves in a stratified fluid , while shallow water theory describes the opposite limit of zero vertical wavenumber .",

    "the other terms are all smaller .",
    "the contribution from the advection of absolute vorticity by the mean meridional circulation is directed westward for dissipation due to friction , and eastward for dissipation due to cooling .",
    "the same conclusion holds for @xmath174 , shown in figure  [ fig : zonalacc_23_n_2 ] , except terms 3,4,5 vanish at the equator .",

    "term 2 , the eliassen  palm flux convergence , is primarily responsible for the positive zonal acceleration in the near - equatorial region due to cooling for @xmath170 .",
    "however , the net zonal acceleration at higher latitudes created by cooling is now primarily due to term 1 , the advection of absolute vorticity by the mean meridional circulation .",
    "this term creates large , negative values of @xmath163 at higher latitudes .",
    "by contrast , the eliassen  palm flux convergence was the dominant contribution at all latitudes in the height - damped shallow water model .    for dissipation by friction and @xmath170 , the eliassen  palm flux convergence contributes a positive zonal acceleration close to the equator , but is outweighed by a large , negative contribution from term 5 due to changes in @xmath196 .",
    "at other latitudes , the eliassen  palm flux convergence is the dominant contribution . for @xmath174 , the eliassen  palm flux convergence is the dominant contribution to @xmath163 at all latitudes , except for two intermediate regions where term 5 is both dominant and negative . for @xmath172 ( not shown ) the eliassen  palm flux convergence is again the main contribution to @xmath177 near the equator .",
    "we have performed a similar analysis for decaying equatorially trapped kelvin , yanai , and inertia - gravity waves in our height - damped and thermal models .",
    "the zonal accelerations due to these waves are at least an order of magnitude smaller than those due to decaying rossby waves of the same amplitude .",
    "thus , as expected from our global quasi - geostrophic simulations , these other types of wave make no significant contribution to setting the direction of the equatorial jet .",
    "our simulation parameters gave a dimensionless cooling rate @xmath197 roughly 23 times larger than our dimensionless frictional rate @xmath198 . in ",
    "[ subsec : mom_h ] we established an antisymmetry in @xmath177 between the cases of small cooling ( @xmath122 and @xmath116 ) and small friction ( @xmath119 and @xmath123 ) for the height - damped shallow water equations .",
    "for @xmath199 , our theory gives @xmath169 in a region near the equator , consistent with the super - rotating equatorial jet in our simulation .",
    "conversely , for the purely frictional case ( @xmath119 ) the zonal mean zonal acceleration is negative throughout the equatorial region ( see figure [ fig : zonalacc ] ) , consistent with the sub - rotating equatorial jet in our simulation .",
    "no corresponding symmetry between @xmath109 and @xmath108 exists in our thermal shallow water model , but the analogue of figure [ fig : zonalacc_t ] for @xmath197 and @xmath198 shows that the positive magnitude of @xmath177 due to dissipation by cooling is significantly larger than the negative magnitude of @xmath177 due to dissipation by friction in the equatorial region .",
    "our theory thus suggests @xmath169 in the equatorial region , again consistent with the formation of a super - rotating equatorial jet in our simulations . for @xmath170 and @xmath172",
    "there is a very small region at the equator where decaying rossby waves produce @xmath187 , but there is a much larger positive contribution from @xmath174 .",
    "our theory thus still suggests a super - rotating equatorial jet , if we assume that waves with even and odd @xmath178 are excited with comparable amplitudes .",
    "numerical simulations of shallow water equations on a sphere with isotropic random forcing reliably produce mixtures of coherent vortices and alternating zonal jets .",
    "these simulations typically include rayleigh friction to absorb the gradual inverse cascade of energy past the rhines scale that otherwise causes the zonal jets to break up into domain - sized coherent vortices after very long times .",
    "such simulations invariably produce sub - rotating equatorial jets when run with jovian parameters @xcite .",
    "however , simulations that model radiative effects by relaxing the height field produce a super - rotating equatorial jet @xcite , as do simulations of the thermal shallow water equations with a newtonian cooling term in their separate temperature equation ( see  [ sect.num ] and * ? ? ?",
    "simulations of the global quasi - geostrophic versions of these three different models produce equatorial jets in the same directions as their parent models @xcite .",
    "we have provided an explanation for the different directions of the equatorial jets in the three different models .",
    "we identified the different contributions to the equation for @xmath163 , the zonal mean zonal acceleration , for small perturbations to a uniform rest state , and evaluated them for equatorially trapped rossby waves decaying through a combination of newtonian cooling and rayleigh friction .",
    "for the standard shallow water equations , with or without height - damping , the resulting zonal acceleration arises predominantly from the convergence of the eliassen  palm flux @xmath200 due to small - amplitude disturbances in shallow water .",
    "this flux vanishes for undamped rossby waves , due to the phase relation between @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "dissipation alters this phase relation to create a net flux of zonal momentum in the meridional direction .",
    "the varying spatial structure of this flux for different values of the dissipation parameters is consistent with the formation of super - rotating equatorial jets in simulations damped primarily by newtonian cooling , and the formation of sub - rotating equatorial jets in simulations damped solely by rayleigh friction .",
    "moreover , the spatial structure is consistent with the presence and locations of two `` horns '' , or peaks of maximal eastward velocity , near the edges of the broad jovian equatorial jet , and a slightly smaller velocity precisely on the equator ( see figure [ fig : ubardata ] ) .",
    "we also performed an equivalent analysis for our thermal shallow water model .",
    "the overall zonal mean zonal acceleration @xmath203 due to equatorially trapped rossby waves decaying due to newtonian cooling is again consistent with the formation of super - rotating equatorial jets in simulations for which cooling is the primary source of dissipation .",
    "however , the eliassen  palm flux convergence is only the largest contribution to @xmath203 very close to the equator . instead , the zonal acceleration due to the advection of absolute vorticity by the mean meridional circulation dominates at higher latitudes .",
    "moreover , a net positive @xmath163 at the equator only arises from newtonian cooling if the positive contributions from even mode numbers ( @xmath174 is shown ) outweigh the smaller negative contributions from odd mode numbers ( @xmath170 and @xmath172 are shown ) under the assumption that both odd and even wave modes are excited with roughly equal amplitudes .",
    "our work relies upon two major simplifying assumptions .",
    "we considered trapped equatorial rossby waves on a background rest state , which allowed us to use the known analytical expressions for these waves in terms of hermite polynomials .",
    "a more complete theory would calculate the rossby wave spectrum supported by a background mean zonal flow @xmath204 .",
    "secondly , we calculated the mean zonal accelerations due to freely decaying rossby waves .",
    "we thus assumed that the waves are excited by sources outside the equatorial region , and neglected the effect of this excitation on the zonal mean flow .",
    "some support for this second assumption is offered by the profiles shown in figures [ fig : source ] and [ fig : sourcez ] for the quantity @xmath69 used by @xcite to diagnose sources of rossby waves .",
    "these sources are located predominantly away from the equatorial regions in our simulations .",
    "although our work falls short of a full wave - mean flow interaction theory in these two respects , we believe it offers at least a step towards a theoretical explanation of the origins of equatorial super- or sub - rotation in numerical simulations .",
