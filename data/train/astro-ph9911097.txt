    "our low value fits well into this group of stars of low fractional abundance .    in their plot ,",
    "savage et al .",
    "( @xcite ) show theoretical curves from equilibrium models of black for different hydrogen densities , radiation densities , and molecule formation rates . according to this ,",
    "our value is described by black s `` model @xmath174 '' , which assumes a density @xmath308 of 100  @xmath309 at a temperature of about @xmath310  k , in accordance to the temperature derived above .",
    "the radiation density at @xmath311    has then a value of @xmath312  erg@xmath309@xmath31 if the molecule formation rate is @xmath313  @xmath314s@xmath31 .      from the and column densities we obtain a deuterium abundance on this line of sight of @xmath315 .",
    "we also tried to identify absorption lines of hd , but without success .",
    "taking the h@xmath4 column density of only @xmath316@xmath2 one would expect hd column densities as low as about @xmath317@xmath2 , which is definitely below the detection limit of @xmath318@xmath2 for the spectra available .",
    "it can be ruled out that any significant amount of deuterium is hidden in hd .",
    "deuterium depletion by interactions with dust grains is unlikely in a warm ism component with low gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the abundance is a value for the whole line of sight , possibly an average over more than one cloud with different @xmath10 ratios .",
    "the uncertainties are rather large , but the value is reliable within its limitations .",
    "there was no need for assumptions about the velocity structure of the absorption ( as it is necessary for line modelling ) since the hydrogen column density determination is mainly based on fully damped absorption while the deuterium lines lie in the linear part of the curve of growth . in both cases",
    "the curve of growth is insensitive to effects arising from clouds of different @xmath55-values and column densities .",
    "furthermore , a model of the stellar spectrum was used only for lyman @xmath0 fitting .",
    "the uncertainty arising from modelling is neglegible because the centres of the stellar and interstellar absorption lines are well separated due to the high radial velocity of the star .",
    "varying scattered light may affect the measured equivalent widths , as mentioned in sect .",
    "however , we do not find evidence for systematic background substraction errors beyond the @xmath319% level in all analyzed h and d lines and the scatter of the equivalent widths is not larger than expected for the estimated errors .",
    "the effect of systematic errors would be rather small .",
    "for example , if all h and d equivalent widths were larger by @xmath148  % than measured due to wrong background substraction , the di column density also would rise by @xmath320% while the hi column density resulting from curve of growth analysis and lyman @xmath0 fitting would change even less .",
    "thus the @xmath10 ratio would be increased by less than @xmath148  % and would remain well within the given range .",
    "mccullough ( @xcite ) finds all _ copernicus _ and _ iue _ ism deuterium abundance measurements to be consistent with @xmath321 .",
    "this value was confirmed for the local interstellar cloud by _ ghrs _ observations towards ( linsky et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ( piskunov et al .",
    "@xcite ) yielding @xmath322 and @xmath323 respectively . for a summary of _ ghrs",

    "the mean of the results of the latter observations is @xmath328 .",
    "our result based on 5 deuterium lines lies below this value though it is consistent within its uncertainty .",
    "recent determinations of @xmath10 for example by vidal - madjar et al .",

    "( @xcite ) using _ imaps _ spectra of ( @xmath331 ) indicate smaller values towards early type stars with @xmath332pc . as vidal - madjar et al . and jenkins et al .",
    "state , a possible explanation may be blending of the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) contribution with that of more distant deuterium - poor clouds .",
    "small scale spatial inhomogeneities of @xmath10 could be the result of the production of significant amounts of deuterium in stellar flares , as mullan & linsky ( @xcite ) suggest .",
    "this discussion remains open since sahu et al .",

    "however this may be , the various determinations of @xmath10 all are consistent with @xmath334 .",
    "the uncertainty in each individual value is influenced by the spectral resolution of the instrument , by the number of d lines used , and by the actual d column density .",
