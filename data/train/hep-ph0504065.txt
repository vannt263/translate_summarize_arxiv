    "<S> the recently discovered sharp peak in the @xmath0 ratio in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is discussed in the framework of the thermal model . in this model a rapid change is expected as the hadronic gas undergoes a transition from a baryon - dominated to a meson - dominated gas . </S>",
    "<S> the transition occurs at a temperature @xmath1 = 140 mev and baryon chemical potential @xmath2 = 410 mev corresponding to an incident energy of @xmath3 = 8.2 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermal model has been extremely successful in bringing order to a very large number of experimental results on particle yields in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the temperature and baryon chemical potential have been found to be consistent with having @xmath4 gev from the lowest beam energies up to the highest ones . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eovern ] which combines results from sis up to rhic . </S>",
    "<S> + the na49 collaboration has recently performed a series of measurements of pb - pb collisions at 20 , 30 , 40 , 80 and 158 agev beam energies . when these results are combined with measurements at lower beam energies from the ags and sis they reveal an unusually sharp variation with beam energy in the @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , and in the @xmath0 ratios . such a strong variation with energy </S>",
    "<S> does not occur in pp collisions and therefore indicates a major difference in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this transition has been referred to in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as the `` horn '' . </S>",
    "<S> a strong variation with energy of the @xmath5 ratio has been predicted on the basis of arguments put forward in  @xcite . in  @xcite another , less spectacular , possibility for the origin of the sharp maximum , namely as being due to the transition from a baryon - dominated to a meson - dominated hadronic gas has been suggested ; the distinction being based on whether the entropy of the hadronic gas is dominated by baryons or by mesons . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> various quantities along the freeze - out curve  @xcite as a function of @xmath3 have been studied in  @xcite .    in the thermal model a steep rise at low energies and a subsequent flattening off leading to a mild maximum in the @xmath0 ratio , was predicted many years ago  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sharpness of the observed peak therefore comes as a surprise . on the other hand , a sharp peak in the @xmath5 ratio </S>",
    "<S> was predicted by the thermal model  @xcite and is in good agreement with the data . while the thermal model can not explain the sharpness of the peak in the @xmath0 ratio , there are nevertheless several phenomena , giving rise to the rapid change , which warrant a closer look at the model .    to get a better estimate of the thermal parameters </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the entropy density as a function of beam energy following the freeze - out curve given in @xcite ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . there is a clear transition from a meson to a baryon - dominated hadronic gas at @xmath3 = 8.2 gev . above this value </S>",
    "<S> the entropy is carried mainly by mesonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the entropy density divided by @xmath7 is constant over the entire freeze - out curve , except for the low - energy , sis , energy region . </S>",
    "<S> the line denoting the transition from a baryon - dominated to a meson - dominated hadron gas is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ entropy_s ] . </S>",
    "<S> this line crosses the freeze - out curve at a temperature of @xmath8 mev , when the baryon chemical potential equals @xmath2 = 410 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding invariant energy is @xmath3 = 8.2 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong decrease in the net baryon density is due to the fact that low energies are characterized by a very low multiplicity of mesons and , correspondingly , a very large baryon - to - meson ratio . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the baryon chemical potential is also very large . </S>",
    "<S> as the beam energy is increased , meson production increases and the baryon chemical potential decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the number of strange baryons produced in heavy - ion collisions at different collision energies will follow the net baryon density since a large baryon chemical potential will also enhance the number of hyperons . </S>",
    "<S> as is well - known  @xcite , the thermal model description leads to a mild maximum in the @xmath0 ratio which does not reproduce the so - called `` horn '' observed by the na49 collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed deviations at the highest sps energy have been interpreted as a lack of full chemical equilibrium in the strangeness sector , leading to a strangeness suppression factor , @xmath9 , deviating from its equilibrium value by about thirty percent . </S>",
    "<S> detailed fits using the thermal model in the region of the `` horn '' show rapid variations in @xmath9 @xcite which do not lend themselves to any interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> there is no corresponding peak in the @xmath10 ratio because the production of @xmath11 is not tied to that of baryons . </S>",
    "<S> as the relative number of baryons decreases with increasing energy , there is no corresponding decrease in the number of @xmath11 as is the case with @xmath12 as these must be balanced by strange baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the maxima in the ratios for multi - strange baryons occur at ever higher beam energies . </S>",
    "<S> the higher the strangeness content of the baryon , the higher in energy is the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is due to a combination of the facts that strangeness has to be balanced , the baryon chemical potential decreases rapidly and the multi - strange baryons have successively higher thresholds . the dependence of the baryon chemical potential on the beam energy is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mub_e ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be expected that if these maxima do not all occur at the same temperature , i.e. at the same beam energy , then the case for a phase transition is not very strong .    in conclusion , while the thermal model can not explain the sharpness of the peak in the @xmath0 ratio , its position corresponds precisely to a transition from a baryon - dominated to a meson - dominated hadronic gas . </S>",
    "<S> this transition occurs at a temperature @xmath13 140 mev , a baryon chemical potential @xmath14 410 mev and an energy @xmath15 8.2 gev . in the thermal model </S>",
    "<S> this transition leads to a sharp peak in the @xmath5 ratio , and to moderate peaks in the @xmath0 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these peaks are at different energies in the thermal model . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal model predicts that the maxima in the @xmath5 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 occur at increasing beam energies . if the change in properties of the above excitation functions were associated with a genuine deconfinement phase transition one would expect these changes to occur at the same beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that more data are needed to clarify the precise nature of the sharp variation observed by the na49 collaboration . </S>"
