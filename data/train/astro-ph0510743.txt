    "it is generally believed at present @xcite that approximately 23% of the energy density of the universe is in the form of  cold dark matter \" ( cdm ) .",
    "the cdm particles must be non - baryonic , collisionless , and of small primordial velocity dispersion .",
    "particle physicists have put forth several candidates with the required properties .",
    "two among these , the axion and the neutralino , have the distinction of having been originally postulated for purely particle physics reasons .",
    "the axion solves the",
    " strong cp problem \" , whereas the neutralino is a prediction of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "the primordial velocity dispersions of these two candidates are very small , of order @xmath0 for axions and @xmath1 for neutralinos .",
    "a central problem in dark matter studies is the question of how cdm is distributed in the halos of galaxies , and in particular in the halos of spiral galaxies such as our own milky way .",
    "indeed knowledge of this distribution is essential for understanding galactic dynamics and for predicting signals in direct and indirect searches for dark matter on earth .",
    "three main approaches towards determining the dark matter distribution in galactic halos have been put forth .",
    "the first assumes that galactic halos are isothermal @xcite .",
    "this assumption is highly predictive and , in fact , some of the predictions of the isothermal model agree with observation , to wit the flatness of rotation curves and the existence of core radii @xcite .",
    "however , even if galactic halos were thermalized in the past , they do not remain so because surrounding dark matter keeps falling onto them @xcite .",
    "there is no mechanism which thermalizes the flows of axions or neutralinos which fall late onto the galaxy .",
    "the second approach is to carry out @xmath2-body simulations of the halos @xcite .",
    "this does presumably give a correct description if the number @xmath2 of particles in the simulations is sufficiently large .",
    "however present simulations have only @xmath3 and , as a result , suffer from 2-body relaxation @xcite and from inadequate sampling of phase space @xcite .",
    "the third approach exploits the fact that the cdm particles lie on a 3-dim .",
    "hypersurface in 6-dim",
    ". phase space @xcite .",
    "this implies that the velocity distribution of dark matter particles at every point in physical space is discrete and that there are surfaces in physical space , called caustics , where the density of dark matter particles is very large .",
    "we have recently argued @xcite that these discrete flows and caustics are a robust prediction of cold dark matter cosmology . the reader may wish to consult ref .",
    "@xcite for background information and a list of references .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the catastrophe structure of the caustic formed in a flow of cold collisionless dark matter particles falling in and out of a galactic gravitational potential well .",
    "we call the caustics thus formed the  inner caustics \" of the galactic halo .",
    "galactic halos also have  outer caustics \" .",
    "an outer caustic occurs near where an outflow of dark matter turns around before falling back in @xcite .",
    "the catastrophe structure of outer caustics is simple .",
    "they are _ fold _",
    "( @xmath4 ) catastrophes @xcite located on topological spheres surrounding the galaxy .",
    "we will see below that the catastrophe structure of inner caustics is relatively more complicated .",
    "we start off below ( section ii ) by proving that there always is an inner caustic , i.e. that it is impossible for cold collisionless particles to flow from all directions in and out of a region without forming a caustic .",
    "the proof indicates that the inner caustic occurs near where the particles with the most angular momentum are at their distance of closest approach to a central point of the region .",
    "this suggests that the structure of an inner caustic depends mainly on the angular momentum distribution of the infalling particles .    in previous work @xcite",
    ", it was shown by analytical methods that the inner caustic is a tricusp ring when the initial velocity field @xmath5 of the infalling particles is dominated by net overall rotation .",
    "a tricusp ring is a closed tube whose cross section is a section of an _",
    "elliptic umbilic _",
    "catastrophe @xcite .",
    "we confirm this result in section iv .",
    "[ axial - b ] shows an axially symmetric tricusp ring as it appears in our simulations .    however , as will be shown below ( section iii ) , the leading theory for the origin of the angular momentum of galaxies , namely tidal torque theory @xcite , predicts that the initial velocity field of dark matter particles is a pure gradient .",
    "a pure gradient field is of course irrotational ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "it can nonetheless carry net angular momentum @xmath7 because the density @xmath8 is inhomogeneous .    motivated by tidal torque theory , we want to determine the structure of the inner caustics of galactic halos when the initial velocity field is irrotational and , more generally , when the initial velocity field is not dominated by net overall rotation .",
    "we address this issue by simulating the infall of cold collisionless particles in a fixed gravitational potential well .",
    "the inner caustic is revealed by finding the locus of points where the jacobian of the map between the initial and final positions of the particles vanishes , i.e. where the map is singular .",
    "we consider all initial velocity fields which are linear in position @xmath9 , i.e. fields of the type @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a @xmath12 real matrix .",
    "we set @xmath13 and more generally ignore the radial component @xmath14 because it does not contribute to angular momentum and hence does not have much influence upon the inner caustics .",
    "tidal torque theory predicts @xmath15 , but we consider the more general case in which @xmath11 has both symmetric and anti - symmetric parts .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section  [ two ]",
    ", we introduce the formalism of zero velocity dispersion flows and caustics , and give an existence proof of inner caustics . in section",
    "[ three ] , we discuss our numerical techniques and the initial conditions expected from tidal torque theory . in section iv , we simulate flows which are dominated by net overall rotation , confirm that the inner caustic is a tricusp ring in that case , and demonstrate the stability of the tricusp ring under small perturbations . in section",
    "[ five ] we simulate flows which are not dominated by overall rotation and derive the structure of inner caustics for those cases . in section",
    "vi , we summarize our conclusions .    in this paper , unless stated otherwise , the words  circle \" and  sphere \" will be used in their topological , rather than geometrical , sense .",
    "so an ellipse will be called a circle , etc .",
    "consider a flow of cold collisionless particles falling from all directions in and out of the gravitational potential well of a galaxy . that the particles are collisionless means that they move under the influence of purely gravitational forces .",
    "we assume in this paper that newtonian gravity applies , and so the particles obey the equation of motion @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "note however that the existence proof of inner caustics given below would hold equally well in general relativity . that the particles are cold means that they have negligible velocity dispersion .",
    "we set the velocity dispersion equal to zero .",
    "however , the presence of a small velocity dispersion does not affect the existence of caustics , and does not change their structure .",
    "it only cuts off the divergence of the dark matter density at the location of the caustics .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , cdm particles lie on a 3-dim .",
    "hypersurface in 6-dim . phase space .",
    "because the number of particles is huge - of order @xmath18 axions and/or @xmath19 neutralinos per galactic halo - the particles can be labeled by three continuous parameters @xmath20 which are chosen arbitrarily .",
    "for example , one may choose @xmath21 to be the position @xmath22 of the particle at some early initial time @xmath23 , before shell crossings have occurred",
    ". other parametrizations may be more convenient however , depending on the problem at hand .",
    "let @xmath24 be the position of the particle labeled @xmath21 , at time @xmath25 .",
    "after shell crossings have occurred , there will in general be particles with different values of @xmath21 at the same location @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , be the solutions of @xmath28 .",
    "thus @xmath29 is the number of distinct flows at location @xmath9 at time @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath30 is always a positive odd integer because @xmath31 to start with ( before shell crossings have occurred ) and the number of solutions of @xmath28 can only change by two at a time .",
    "let @xmath32 be the number density of particles in the chosen parameter space .",
    "the mass density of particles in physical space is then @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the particle mass and @xmath35 the magnitude of @xmath36 is the jacobian of the map @xmath37 .",
    "caustics occur where @xmath38 , _ i.e. _ where the map is singular .",
    "note that , although @xmath36 is not reparametrization invariant , the density @xmath39 and the caustic condition @xmath38 are reparametrization invariant .",
    "caustics lie generically on 2-dim .",
    "surfaces because , in general , the condition @xmath38 defines a surface in physical space . only in special cases",
    "does the condition @xmath38 define an isolated line or point .",
    "hence isolated line caustics and isolated point caustics are degenerate cases ; they are unstable towards becoming caustic surfaces .",
    "finally note that the map @xmath40 is singular where the number of flows @xmath30 changes .",
    "so caustics lie generically at the boundaries between regions which have different numbers of flows .",
    "on one side of a caustic surface are two more flows than on the other .",
    "we now show that a continous flow of cdm particles falling in and out of a gravitational potential well can not be free of caustics .",
    "let us define a geometrical sphere of radius @xmath41 surrounding the potential well .",
    "the precise value of @xmath41 and the precise location of the sphere s center do not matter .",
    "let us label the particles by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the time when the particle crosses the sphere on its way into the well , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the polar coordinates of its crossing point on the sphere .",

    "we will show that , at any @xmath25 , @xmath47 vanishes at at least one point inside the sphere .",
    "the flow is considered at an arbitrary fixed time @xmath25 .",
    "we will suppress the label @xmath25 henceforth .    for each @xmath48 , the initial",
    "crossing time parameter @xmath43 has some range : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial crossing time of particles presently crossing the sphere on the way in ( out ) . [",
    "the careful reader may notice that @xmath51 , but this does not play a special role in what s to follow .",
    "] let us choose the origin @xmath52 at the center of the sphere and consider the function of three variables @xmath53 .",

    "@xmath58 is the closest distance to the origin among all particles labeled @xmath48 .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath59 for some @xmath60 .",
    "we will return later to the opposite case , where @xmath61 for all @xmath48 .",

    "( [ partau ] ) and ( [ parthetaphi ] ) imply that @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are all perpendicular to @xmath72 .",

    "this implies that @xmath72 is the location of a caustic .",
    "note that @xmath72 depends on the choice of origin .",
    "if we move the origin about , @xmath72 will move too .",
    "thus the inner caustic is in general spatially extended .",

    "@xmath80 for small @xmath43 .",
    "hence @xmath81 since @xmath38 at @xmath82 , the origin is the location of a caustic .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "note that the case @xmath83 is special since the whole inner caustic has collapsed to a point .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us remark that in the situation discussed here , where cdm particles fall in and out of a gravitational potential well , the number of participating flows inside the sphere with radius @xmath41 is everywhere an even integer .",
    "indeed just inside the @xmath84 surface there are two flows , one going in and one going out , and ( as remarked earlier ) the number of flows can only change by two at a time .",
    "the reader may wonder how this fits with the statement that the number of flows is everywhere odd .",
    "the resolution of this little puzzle is that , in actual realizations such as a galactic halo , there is always an odd number of additional flows present which are not participating in the in and out flow under consideration .",

    "net rotation is a striking property of isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "yet it is not clear at present that the origin of this net rotation is well understood @xcite .",
