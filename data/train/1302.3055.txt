    "recent cosmological observations have revealed that our universe is currently undergoing an accelerating phase of expansion @xcite .",
    "this transition to the accelerating phase has been occurred in the recent cosmological past .",
    "several approaches have been proposed to explain this late - time acceleration of the universe . introducing some sort of unknown energy component ( dubbed `` _ _ dark energy _ _ '' ) , with negative pressure , is one of these various approaches @xcite .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant .",
    "however , the cosmological constant suffers from serious problems such as huge amount of fine - tuning required for its magnitude and other theoretical problems such as unknown origin and lake of dynamics @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the standard cosmological model with a cosmological constant has no internal problems or inconsistencies both at the classical and quantum levels@xcite .    in this regard ,",
    "the scalar fields such as quintessence @xcite , phantom fields @xcite , tachyon fields @xcite and so on , provide a simple dynamical model for dark energy which can explain cosmic accelerating expansion .",
    "the scalar fields can directly couple to matter lagrangian , or indirectly couple to the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "if there are negligible self - interactions for scalar fields , then the experimental bounds on such fields require it to either couple to the matter much more weakly than the gravity does , or to couple very strongly @xcite .",
    "such fields must be very light ( their mass must be of the order of @xmath0 , the present hubble parameter ) in order to evolve cosmologically today . also , in order to have consistency with equivalence principal , their coupling to the matter must be extremely small .",
    "chameleon cosmology @xcite is a scenario which can address this problem suitably . in the chameleon cosmology ,",
    "the scalar fields evolve on the cosmological time scales today , while according to the expectations from string theory they have couplings of order unity to the matter and at the same time remain very light on the cosmological scales .",
    "in fact , the mass of the scalar field is not constant and instead , it depends on the local matter density . in the high density regime ,",
    "the mass of the scalar fields is large , so that the resulting violations of the equivalence principal are exponentially suppressed . on the cosmological scales , where the density is very low",
    ", the mass of the fields can be of the order of the present hubble parameter ( @xmath0 ) and cause the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "such a scalar field is dubbed `` chameleon '' because its physical properties , such as its mass , depend on its environment @xcite .",
    "we note that this definition of the `` chameleon '' field is too wide and includes situations such as plasma density dependence of plasmon mass and also density and temperature dependence of elementary particles masses through their effective potentials . in our setup",
    "the term chameleon has sense only in the case of specific exponential coupling of known quantum fields of matter to the chameleon field @xcite .",
    "the present work has been organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the idea of chameleon cosmology .",
    "we consider a quintom scalar field which is non - minimally coupled to the matter ( a quintom field is a hybrid of a quintessence and a phantom field @xcite ) . in this section , by means of the conservation equation , we derive the matter energy density which depends on the hybrid scalar field .",
    "we study the effective chameleon potential , its minimum and the mass of two fields about the minimum of the potential .",
    "we show that the value of the scalar fields and their masses at the minimum depend on local energy density . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the cosmological dynamics of the model in the dynamical system approach and we provide a detailed phase space analysis of the model .",
    "we find that in the parameters space of the model it is possible to have a chameleon dominated stable attractor which has a negative effective equation of state .",
    "we also show that in this setup , the effective equation of state parameter of the model crosses the phantom divide line and the deceleration parameter becomes negative in the past .",
    "so this model has the capability to explain the late - time cosmic speed - up .",
    "the action of a two - field chameleon model in 4-dimensions can be written as follows    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the gravitational coupling and @xmath3 represents the lagrangian density of the matter fields . also , the matter fields @xmath4 are coupled to the scalar fields by the definition @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are dimensionless constants . in this paper , we assume just a single matter energy density component ( @xmath7 ) with coupling @xmath8 . also , according to the expectations from string theory , we allow @xmath8 to be of the order of unity .    in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker background ,",
    "variation of action ( 1 ) with respect to the metric , leads to the following equations @xmath9 @xmath10 to derive these equations we have assumed that the matter field of the universe is a perfect fluid , so that @xmath11 . variation of the action ( 1 ) with respect to the scalar fields gives the following equation of motion @xmath12    equations ( 2)-(4 ) give us the energy conservation equation of the model as follows @xmath13 the right hand side of equation ( 5 ) shows the non - conservation of the energy density in this setup , which is due to the presence of non - minimal coupling between the hybrid scalar field and matter lagrangian ( in other words , it is due to the presence of the chameleon field ) . in the absence of chameleon field ( the case that @xmath8 goes to zero ) , equation ( 5 ) simplifies to the ordinary conservation equation .    if we integrate equation ( 5 ) , we reach the following expression for the matter energy density @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "this equation shows that the scalar fields and the matter energy density are related to each other via the chameleon coupling term .    by using equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 )",
    ", we can deduce the effective equation of state parameter in our setup as follows @xmath16    equation ( 4 ) shows that dynamics of hybrid scalar field in this case does not depend just only to the @xmath17 , but instead it depends on an effective potential which is defined as follows @xmath18 which is usually dubbed chameleon effective potential .",
    "this effective potential depends explicitly on the matter density @xmath7 .",
    "we note that we assume a runaway potential defined as @xmath19 which decreases by increment of the scalar fields .",
    "also , the coupling term ( @xmath20 ) increases as the scalar fields increase ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "so , if @xmath21 , @xmath22 has minimum .",
    "the behavior of the effective potential with respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 is shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "we denote the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where the effective potential becomes minimum ( the derivative of the effective potential becomes zero ) , by @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "then , the minimum of the effective potential in our model occurs at    @xmath27    the above expression shows that , the minimum of the effective chameleon potential is a line .",
    "since we deal with positive scalar field , @xmath26 leads us to a constraint on @xmath23 as follows @xmath28 this means that if @xmath23 satisfies the constraint equation ( 11 ) , there is a minimum for effective potential as is shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",

    "the effective chameleon potential reaches a minimum ( a line in this case ) during its evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    the mass of the scalar field @xmath23 about the minimum is obtained from the following relation @xmath29 so , we find @xmath30 also the mass of the scalar field @xmath24 is given by @xmath31 leading to the result @xmath32 as equations ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) show , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are increasing functions of local matter density , @xmath7 .",
    "this means that , the larger values of matter density lead to larger values of the chameleon field s mass .",
    "in this section , we are going to study cosmological dynamics of the hybrid chameleon model introduced in previous section in the framework of dynamical system analysis and phase space trajectories of the model . in this regard",
    ", we should firstly introduce some new convenient dimensionless variables .",
    "these dimensionless quantities help us to translate our equations of the cosmological dynamics in the language of the autonomous dynamical system . in our setup , the dimensionless parameters are defined as follows @xmath35 by rewriting the friedmann equation ( 2 ) in terms of the new variables , we reach a constraint on the parameters space of the model as follows @xmath36 by which we can express one of the dimensionless variables in terms of the others .    by introducing a new time variable @xmath37 , we obtain the following autonomous system in our setup @xmath38,\\ ] ] @xmath39,\\ ] ] @xmath40,\\ ] ] @xmath41.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , in order to analyze the cosmological evolution in the dynamical system approach , we should find fixed ( or critical ) points of the model .",
    "fixed points are defined as those points that autonomous equations ( 18)-(21 ) all vanish .",
    "eliminating @xmath42 by using constraint equation ( 17 ) , we obtain the critical points of our setup . we find four critical points ( * m * , * n * , * p * , * q * ) and two critical lines ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) in our setup which we have summarized their properties in tables  [ tab : table1 ] ,  [ tab : table2 ] and  [ tab : table3 ] .
