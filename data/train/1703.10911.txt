    "the formation of excitonic quantum condensates is an intensively studied continuous problem in condensed matter physics  @xcite . whilst theoretically predicted a long time ago  @xcite , no conclusive experimental proof of the existence of the excitonic condensation has been achieved yet .",
    "however , the latest experimental studies of materials with strong electronic correlations showed that promising candidates for the experimental verification of the excitonic condensation could be @xmath8  @xcite,@xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , or a double bilayer graphene system  @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the mixed valence compound @xmath8 was argued to exhibit a pressure - induced excitonic instability , related to an anomalous increase in the electrical resistivity  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the detailed studies of the pressure - induced semiconductor - semimetal transition in this material ( based on the hall effect , electrical and thermal ( transport ) measurements ) showed that excitons are created in a large number and condense below 20  k. on the other hand , in the layered transition - metal dichalcogenide @xmath9 , a bcs - like electron - hole pairing was considered as the driving force for the periodic lattice distorsion  @xcite .",
    "moreover , quite recently , the excitonic - insulator state was probed by angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy in the semiconducting @xmath10 compound  @xcite . at present",
    ", it is generally accepted that the minimal theoretical model for a description of excitonic correlations in these materials could be the falicov - kimball model  @xcite and its extensions  @xcite .",
    "the original falicov - kimball model describes a tight - binding system of itinerant @xmath6 electrons interacting via the on - site coulomb repulsion with localized @xmath5 electrons ( the spin degrees of freedom of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 electrons are not included ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron in the localized state at lattice site @xmath14 with binding energy @xmath7 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the creation and annihilation operators of the itinerant spinless electrons ( with the nearest - neighbor @xmath6-electron hopping constant @xmath17 ) in the @xmath6-band wannier state at site @xmath14 .",
    "in what follows we consider @xmath18 and all energies are measured in units of @xmath17 .    since the local @xmath5-electron number @xmath19 is strictly conserved quantity , the @xmath6-@xmath5 electron coherence can not be established in this model . one way to overcome",
    "this shortcoming is to include an explicit local hybridization @xmath20 between the @xmath6 and @xmath5 orbitals .",
    "this model has been extensively studied in our previous work  @xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis of the excitonic momentum distribution @xmath21 ( with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the number of lattice sites ) showed that this quantity diverges for @xmath2 , signalizing a massive condensation of preformed excitons at this momentum .",
    "the stability of the zero - momentum ( @xmath2 ) condensate against the @xmath5-electron hopping has been studied in our very recent paper  @xcite . it was found that the negative values of the @xmath5-electron hopping integrals @xmath24 support the formation of zero - momentum condensate , while the positive values of @xmath24 have the fully opposite effect .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the fully opposite effects on the formation of condensate exhibit also the local and nonlocal hybridization with an inversion symmetry .",
    "the first one strongly supports the formation of condensate , while the second one destroys it completely .",
    "however , in the real @xmath6-@xmath5 systems , the on - site hybridization @xmath1 is usually forbidden for parity reasons  @xcite , and therefore the fact that the nonlocal hybridization with an inversion symmetry does not support the formation of excitonic condensate strongly limits the class of materials , where this phenomenon can be observed .",
    "in this situation , the most promising candidates for studying this phenomenon seem to be the systems with equal parity orbitals , where the nonlocal hybridization @xmath25 can be written as : @xmath26 in such systems , the local hybridization @xmath1 is allowed , and thus one can examine the combined effects of the local and nonlocal hybridization within the unified picture .",
    "the weak ( @xmath27 ) and strong ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) coupling limits of the model hamiltonian @xmath30 have been analyzed recently by zenker et al . in  @xcite , and the corresponding mean - field quantum phase diagrams were presented as functions of the model parameters @xmath31 and @xmath7 for the half - filed band case @xmath32 and @xmath33 . moreover , examining effects of the local @xmath1 and nonlocal @xmath3 hybridization they found that in the pseudospin space ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) the nonlocal hybridization @xmath3 favors the staggered ising - type ordering allong the @xmath36 direction , while @xmath1 favors a uniform polarization along the @xmath36 direction and the staggered ising - type ordering along the @xmath37 direction .    in the current paper",
    "we examine model for arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath3 and unlike the paper of zenker et al .",
    "@xcite we focus our attention primarily on a description of process of formation and condensation of exitonic bound states .",
    "for this reason we calculate ( by the dmrg method ) various ground state characteristics of the model such as the excitonic momentum distribution @xmath0 , the density of zero momentum excitons @xmath38 , the total exciton density @xmath39 , the total @xmath6-electron density @xmath40 and the total density of unbound @xmath6 electrons @xmath41 , and analyze their bahaviours as functions of the local / nolocal hybridization and the @xmath5-level position @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that such a study could be very valuable from the point of view of real materials , since taking into account the parametrization between the external pressure and the position of the @xmath5 level ( @xmath42 ) , one could deduce from the @xmath7 dependencies of the ground state characteristics also their @xmath43 dependencies , at least qualitatively  @xcite . as shown at the end of this paper a simple model based on the above mentioned parametrization can yield a reasonable explanation for the pressure - induced resistivity anomaly observed experimentally in @xmath8 compound  @xcite .",
    "to examine combined effects of the local @xmath1 and nonlocal @xmath44 hybridization on the formation and condensation of excitonic bound states in the extended falicov - kimball model we have performed exhaustive dmrg studies of the model hamiltonian @xmath45 for a wide range of the model parameters @xmath46 and @xmath7 at the total electron density @xmath47 ( the half - filled band case ) . in all examined cases we typically keep up to 500 states per block , although in the numerically more difficult cases , where the dmrg results converge slower , we keep up to 1000 states .",
    "truncation errors  @xcite , given by the sum of the density matrix eigenvalues of the discarded states , vary from @xmath48 in the worse cases to zero in the best cases .",

    "3b and it clearly demonstrates that different behaviour of of @xmath72 below and above @xmath1 is obviously caused by the cdw order , which supports formation of the zero - momentum condensate .",
