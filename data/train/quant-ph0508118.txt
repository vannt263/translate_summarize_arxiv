    "quantum information , an ingenious application of quantum mechanics within the field of information has attracted a lot of attentions @xcite . in particular almost all the branches of quantum communication",
    "have been developed quickly since the original protocol was proposed by bennett and brassard @xcite in 1984 , such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , quantum secure direction communication ( qsdc ) @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum secret sharing ( qss ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "qkd provides a secure way for creating a private key between two remote parties . with a private key ,",
    "most of the goals in classical secure communication can be accomplished .",
    "for example , a classical secret message can be transmitted securely by using classical one - time pad crypto - system with a private key . to date",
    ", qkd has progressed quickly and becomes one of the most mature applications of quantum information .",
    "qss is likely to play a key role in both transmitting of a classical information and protecting a secret quantum information , such as in secure operations of distributed quantum computation , sharing difficult - to - construct ancillary states and joint sharing of quantum money @xcite .",
    "suppose a banker , alice , wants her two agents , bob and charlie who are at remote places to deal with her business according to her message ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "however alice doubts that one of them may be dishonest and the business may be destroyed if the dishonest one manages it independently .",
    "moreover alice does not know who the dishonest one is , but she knows that the number of dishonest person is less than two . to prevent the dishonest man from destroying the business , classical cryptography provides the secret sharing scheme @xcite in which alice splits her message ( @xmath2 ) into two sequences ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and sends them to bob and charlie , respectively .",
    "they can read out the message @xmath5 if and only if they cooperate , otherwise they will get nothing .",
    "qss is the generalization of classical secret sharing @xcite into quantum scenario and supplies a secure way for sharing not only a classical information @xcite but also a quantum information @xcite . in the latter , the sender",
    ", alice will send an unknown quantum state to her @xmath1 agents and one of them can recover it with the help of the others @xcite . compared with qkd , qss can reduce the the resources necessary for the communication @xcite for a classical secret information . moreover ,",
    "the sharing and the splitting of an unknown quantum state should resort to qss with quantum entanglement , which is called quantum state sharing @xcite ( abbreviate it as qsts for the difference from qss of a classical information @xcite ) recently , and can not be implemented in only a classical way .",
    "for example , li et al . proposed a qsts scheme for sharing an unknown single qubit with @xmath1 agents . in their scheme ,",
    "alice shares @xmath1 einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs with the @xmath1 agents , and she performs an @xmath6-particle greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state measurement on the unknown quantum system and her @xmath1 epr particles .",
    "@xmath7 agents take a single - particle measurement on their epr particles and the last agent can recover the original unknown state with the helps of all the other agents .",
    "quantum teleportation @xcite is a quantum technique with which the two remote parties , the sender alice and the receiver bob , exploit the nonlocal correlations of the quantum channel shared in advance , such as an einstin - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pair , to teleport an unknown quantum state @xmath8 .",
    "the task can be accomplished by means that alice makes a bell - basis measurement on her epr particle and the unknown quantum system @xmath9 , and bob reconstructs the state @xmath10 with a local unitary operation on his epr particle according to the classical information published by alice @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will propose a protocol for multiparty quantum secret splitting with epr pairs following some ideas in refs .",
    "it has the high intrinsic efficiency and source capacity as almost all the instances are useful and each epr pair carries two bits of message securely .",
    "moreover , we modify it for multiparty quantum state sharing ( mqsts ) of an arbitrary @xmath1-particle entangled state based on quantum teleportation @xcite . the parties exploit epr pairs and bell - state measurements to accomplish this task , which makes this protocol more convenient in a practical application than others .",
    "in a qss , its security is simplified to prevent the dishonest agent from eavesdropping freely as the parties can detected any eavesdropper if they can find out the dishonest one in the agents @xcite .",
    "our multiparty quantum secret splitting ( mqssp ) protocol inherits this feature . for convenience ,",
    "let us first describe a three - party quantum secret splitting protocol , and then generalize it to the case with @xmath0 agents , similar to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an epr pair is in one of the four bell states shown as following @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the two eigenvectors of a two - level quantum system , and the subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the two particles in an epr pair . the four local unitary operations @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) can transform one of the bell states into another .",

    "suppose the three parties in the mqsts are the sender alice and her two agents , bob and charlie .",
    "the basic idea of our mqsts protocol is that the two photons in each epr pairs prepared by the agent bob are not transmitted simultaneously in the insecure quantum channel , and alice codes her message with four local unitary operations after confirming the security of the channel , same as the two - step qsdc scheme @xcite .",

    "<S> a protocol for multiparty quantum secret splitting is proposed with an ordered @xmath0 einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs and bell - state measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it is secure and has the high intrinsic efficiency and source capacity as almost all the instances are useful and each epr pair carries two bits of message securely . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we modify it for multiparty quantum state sharing of an arbitrary @xmath1-particle entangled state based on quantum teleportation with only bell - state measurements and local unitary operations which make this protocol more convenient in a practical application than others . </S>"
