    "the fitness landscape metaphor appears most commonly when describing the dynamics of evolutionary algorithms , and its origins are attributed to the population geneticist sewall wright @xcite .",
    "however , the metaphor can be used for computational search in general ; the search space can be regarded as a spacial structure where each point ( candidate solution ) has a height ( objective function value ) forming a landscape surface . in this scenario",
    ", the search process would be an adaptive - walk over a landscape that can range from having many peaks of high fitness boarding deep cliffs to valleys of low fitness , to being smooth , with low hills and gentle valleys .",
    "identifying the landscape features affecting the effectiveness of heuristic search algorithms is relevant for both predicting their performance and improving their design .",
    "some properties of landscapes that are known to have a strong influence on heuristic search are the number of local optima or peaks in the landscape , the distribution of the local optima in the search space , the correlation between fitness values of neighboring points in the landscape , the topology of the basins of attraction of the local optima , and the presence of neutrality ( different search points having the same objective value ) .",
    "statistical methods have been proposed to measure some of these properties , for example , fitness - distance correlation  @xcite , distributions of solutions density  @xcite , landscape correlation functions  @xcite , and the negative slope coefficient  @xcite .",
    "these metrics work by sampling the landscape surface to provide an approximation of its shape .",
    "an alternative view , first introduced in chemical physics in the study of energy landscapes  @xcite , is to construct a network formed by the landscape local optima ( minima or maxima ) . in this view of energy surfaces , the network s vertices are energy minima and there is an edge between two minima if the system can jump from one to the other with an energy cost of the order of the thermal energies .",
    "usually this `` transition state '' goes through a low energy barrier such as a saddle point in the surface .",
    "the resulting graph has been referred to as _ inherent network_. recent work by doye and coworkers and by caflish and coworkers  @xcite has shown the benefits of this approach : it provides a synthetic view of the energy landscape and the network can be studied using appropriate statistical methods to characterize it in various ways  @xcite . for example , doye et al .",
    "@xcite found that the inherent networks of the energy landscapes of small atomic clusters are often of the scale - free type with a power - law degree distribution function , featuring a kind of single or multiple `` funnel '' structure .",
    "the global energy minimum is the most highly connected node at the bottom of the funnel .",
    "this means that the path to the global energy minimum is easy to follow starting anywhere in the energy landscape .",
    "the concept of community structure of a network , introduced first for social networks  @xcite , has also been applied , showing that in some cases energy minima split into almost separate groups or communities  @xcite .",
    "this effect is even more spectacular for polypeptides  @xcite .",
    "this kind of information is invaluable for understanding the dynamics induced on the energy landscape such as cluster rearrangements or protein folding .",
    "the _ local optima networks _ fitness landscape model , described in this chapter , adapts the notion of the inherent network of energy surfaces to the realm of combinatorial ( discrete ) search spaces . as for energy surfaces ( which exist in continuous space )",
    ", the vertices correspond to solutions that are minima or maxima of the associated combinatorial problem , but edges are defined differently .",
    "the combinatorial counterpart considers oriented and weighted edges . in a first version , the weights represent an approximation to the probability of transition between the respective basins in a given direction @xcite .",
    "this definition , although informative , produced densely connected networks and required exhaustive sampling of the basins of attraction . a second version ,",
    "_ escape edges _ was proposed in @xcite , which does not require a full computation of the basins . instead",
    ", these edges account for the chances of escaping a local optimum after a controlled mutation ( e.g. 1 or 2 bit - flips in binary space ) followed by hill - climbing . as a first benchmark case in the study of local optima networks , the well studied family of abstract landscapes , the kauffman s @xmath0 model ,",
    "was selected @xcite . in this model",
    "the ruggedness , and hence the difficulty of the landscape , can be tuned from easy to hard .",
    "two nk models incorporating _ neutrality _",
    "( i.e. extended regions of equal or quasi - equal fitness ) were considered : the @xmath1 ( ` probabilistic ' @xmath0 )  @xcite , and @xmath2 ( ` quantized ' @xmath0 )  @xcite families .",
    "subsequently , a more complex and realistic search space was studied . specifically , the quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) introduced by koopmans and beckmann  @xcite , which is known to be np - hard  @xcite .",
    "the local optima network model captures in detail the number and distribution of local optima in the search space ; features which are known to be of utmost importance for understanding the search difficulty of the corresponding landscape .",
    "this understanding may be exploited when designing efficient search algorithms .",
    "for example , it has been observed in many combinatorial landscapes that local optima are not randomly distributed , rather they tend to be clustered in a  central massif \" ( or  big valley \" if we are minimizing ) .",
    "this globally convex landscape structure has been observed in the @xmath0 family of landscapes @xcite , and in many combinatorial optimization problems , such as the traveling salesman problem @xcite , graph bipartitioning  @xcite , and flowshop scheduling @xcite .",
    "search algorithms exploiting this global structure have been proposed  @xcite . for the travelling salesman problem , the big - valley structure holds in much of the search space .",
    "however , it has been recently found that the big - valley structure disappears , giving rise to multiple funnels , around local optima that are very close to the global optimum @xcite .",
    "a specialized crossover operator has been proposed to exploit and overcome this multi - funnel structure @xcite .",
    "the analysis of local optima networks so far has shown interesting correlations between network features and known search difficulty on the studied combinatorial problems .",
    "this chapter overviews the conception and analysis of local optima networks .",
    "a brief account of the science of complex networks is given before describing the combinatorial landscapes , relevant definitions and methods employed .",
    "a summary of the most relevant results of the analysis is presented , and finally , the prospects of this research effort are discussed .",
    "the last few years have seen an increased interest in the structure of the big networks that form part of our daily environment such as the world wide web , the internet , transportation and electrical power networks , web - based social networks such as facebook , and many others .",
    "these networks have properties that are unparalleled in simple graphs such as lattices , properties that are akin to those of _ complex systems _ in general . in these systems , it is difficult or even impossible to infer global behaviors given the rules that are obeyed by the system components and their interactions . for this reason ,",
    "these big networks are called _ complex networks _ and their structure gives rise to a wide range of dynamical behaviors .",
    "since this chapter draws heavily on complex network nomenclature and methods , to make it self - contained to a large extent , we give a brief introduction to the field .",
    "there exist many references on complex networks : a technical but still very readable introductory book is  @xcite , while  @xcite is a comprehensive reference .",
    "mathematically , networks are just _ graphs _",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the set of _ vertices _ and @xmath5 is the set of edges that join pairs of vertices . a complex network class that enjoys a precise mathematical description is _ random graphs _ which are introduced below .",
    "random graphs are a useful abstraction that can sometimes be used to model real networks or , at least , to compare with actual complex networks .",
    "the random - graph model was formally defined by erds and rnyi at the end of the 1950s . in its simplest form ,",
    "the model consists of @xmath6 vertices joined by edges that are placed between pairs of vertices uniformly at random .",
    "in other words , each of the possible @xmath7 edges is present with probability @xmath8 and absent with probability @xmath9 .",
    "the model is often referred to as @xmath10 to point out that , rigorously speaking , there is no such thing as a random graph , but rather an ensemble @xmath10 of equiprobable graphs .",
    "another closely related model of a random graph considers the family of graphs @xmath11 with @xmath6 vertices and exactly @xmath12 edges . for @xmath13 , there are @xmath14 graphs with @xmath12 edges . if the probability of selecting any one of them is @xmath15 , then the ensemble @xmath11 is called the family of uniform random graphs . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the two models are very similar , but we shall use @xmath10 in what follows .",
    "a few simple facts are worth noting about random graphs .",
    "the _ average degree _",
    "@xmath17 of a graph @xmath18 is the average of all the vertex degrees in @xmath18 : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the degree of vertex @xmath21 . if @xmath22 is the number of edges in @xmath18 , then @xmath23 , since @xmath24 ( each edge is counted twice ) .",
    "the expected number of edges of a random graph belonging to @xmath10 is clearly @xmath25 , but since each edge has two ends , the average number of edge ends is @xmath26 , which in turn means that the average degree of a vertex in a random graph is    @xmath27    for sufficiently large @xmath6 .",
    "an important property of a connected random graph is that the average path length , i.e the mean distance between nodes , is of the order of @xmath28 , which means that any two nodes are only a short distance apart since @xmath28 grows very slowly with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "random graphs are interesting objects as they obey , in a probabilistic sense , general mathematical properties .",
    "they are also a useful model for generating problem instances for testing network algorithms , and they are used in other ways too . but are random graphs a useful model of the networks that permeate society ? actually , social scientists felt qualitatively as early as the 1950s that social and professional links and acquaintances did not follow a random structure .",
    "for example , if a person has some relationship with two others , then the latter two are more likely to know each other than are two arbitrary persons .",
    "this does not fit the random - graph model , however , where the likelihood that two given nodes are connected is the same independent of any other consideration . in a ground - breaking paper , watts and strogatz  @xcite proposed a simple network construction algorithm that gives rise to graphs having the following properties : the path length from any node to any other node is short , as in random graphs ; but , unlike random graphs , there is local structure in the network .",
    "watts and strogatz called their networks _ small - world networks _ , a term that has been in use for a long time in the field of social games to indicate that there is a small separation between any two persons in a large social network .    the discovery of these new properties was made possible by the abundance of online network data and the computer power to analyze these data ; something that was not available to social scientists at earlier times .",
    "many networks have been studied since , both man - made and natural : the internet , the world wide web , scientific collaboration and coauthorship networks , metabolic and neural networks , air traffic , telephone calls , e - mail exchanges , and many others  @xcite . most of these studies have confirmed that , indeed , real networks are not random in the sense of random - graph theory , and they possess a number of quite interesting properties .    some definitions of global and local network properties that will be used in the rest of the chapter are described below .      drawing and visualizing",
    "a network with up to a few tens of nodes may help in understanding its structure .",
    "however , when there are thousands of nodes , this is no longer possible .",
    "for this reason , a number of statistics have been proposed to describe the main features of a graph . taken together ,",
    "these statistics characterize the nature of a network .",
    "four statistics are particularly useful : the average degree , already defined in sect .",
    "[ rand - graphs ] , the _ clustering coefficient _ , the _ average path length _ , and the _ degree distribution function_. we shall now briefly describe these graph measures .",
    "a fuller treatment can be found in  @xcite .",
    "[ [ clustering - coefficient . ] ] clustering coefficient .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    here we use the following definition of clustering : consider a particular node @xmath21 in a graph , and let us assume that it has degree @xmath29 , i.e. it has @xmath29 edges connecting it to its @xmath29 neighboring nodes .",
    "if all @xmath29 vertices in the neighborhood were completely connected to each other , forming a clique , then the number of edges would be equal to @xmath30 .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath31 of node @xmath21 is defined as the ratio between the @xmath32 edges that actually exist between the @xmath29 neighbors and the number of possible edges between these nodes    @xmath33    thus @xmath31 is a measure of the `` cliquishness '' of a neighborhood : the higher the value of @xmath31 ,",
    "the more likely it is that two vertices that are adjacent to a third one are also neighbors of each other .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ cc ] , the leftmost case has @xmath34 since none of the links between node @xmath21 s neighbors is present . in the middle figure ,",
    "three out of the possible six links are present and thus @xmath35 , while in the rightmost case @xmath36 since all six links between @xmath21 s neighbors are present .    [ !",
    "ht ]    , @xmath37 since there are no links among @xmath21 s neighbors . in the middle image @xmath38 because three out of the possible six edges among the neighbors of @xmath21 are present . in the right image @xmath39 as all the edges that could be there are actually present ( it is a clique ) .",
    "[ cc],title=\"fig : \" ] +    the _ average clustering coefficient _ @xmath40 is the average of @xmath41 over all @xmath6 vertices @xmath42 : @xmath43 the clustering coefficient of a graph @xmath18 thus expresses the degree of locality of the connections .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a random graph is simply @xmath44 , where _",
    "n _ is the total number of vertices and @xmath8 is the probability that there is an edge between any two vertices since all edges are equiprobable and uncorrelated .",
    "one thus sees that the clustering coefficient of a random graph decreases with the graph size @xmath6 and approaches @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a complete graph is @xmath47 , since each of a node s neighbors are connected to each other by definition .",
    "[ [ average - path - length . ] ] average path length .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the _ distance _ between two nodes @xmath48 and @xmath21 is defined as the number of edges between @xmath48 and @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the shortest path between nodes @xmath49 by @xmath50 as being the path with the shortest distance .",
    "the average , or mean , path length @xmath51 of @xmath18 is then defined as    @xmath52    the normalizing constant @xmath53 is the inverse of the total number of pairs of vertices .",
    "if there is no path between any two nodes , their distance is conventionally set to @xmath54 ( note that eq .",
    "[ eq : av - path - len ] does not hold in this case ) .",
    "the mean path length gives an idea of `` how long '' it takes to navigate a connected network .",
    "random graphs and small - world networks share the property that @xmath55 scales as @xmath28 and thus most vertices in these networks are connected by a short path .",
    "this is not the case in @xmath56-dimensional regular lattice graphs , where @xmath51 scales as @xmath57 .",
    "for instance , in a ring @xmath51 scales linearly with @xmath6 and is inversely proportional to @xmath29 , the number of neighbors .",
    "[ [ degree - distribution - function . ] ] degree distribution function .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the degree distribution @xmath58 of an undirected graph @xmath18 is a function that gives the probability that a randomly selected vertex has degree @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath58 can also be seen as the fraction of vertices in the graph that have degree @xmath29 .",
    "similar definitions also apply for the in - links and out - links of the vertices in a directed graph for which one can define a degree distribution function for both the outgoing @xmath59 and the the incoming @xmath60 links .    for a random graph with connection probability @xmath8 ,",
    "the probability @xmath58 that a random node has degree @xmath29 is given by @xmath61    this is the number of ways in which @xmath29 edges can be selected from a certain node out of the @xmath62 possible edges , given that the edges can be chosen independently of each other and have the same probability @xmath8 .",
    "thus @xmath58 is a binomial distribution peaked at @xmath63 , as already found in equation ( [ eq : av - degr - rg ] ) .",
    "since this distribution has a rapidly diminishing tail , most nodes will have similar degrees .",
    "low- and high - degree nodes , say a few standard deviations away from the mean , have a negligible probability , since the tails fall off very rapidly .",
    "networks having this degree distribution will thus be rather homogeneous as far as the connectivity is concerned . for large @xmath6 and for @xmath64 constant",
    ", the binomial distribution can be well approximated by the poisson distribution of mean @xmath65 : @xmath66 + another rapidly - decaying degree distribution function that appears in model graphs is the exponential distribution : @xmath67 this degree distribution results when nodes are progressively added to a growing network such that a new node has the same probability of forming a link with any of the already existing nodes .",
    "most real networks , however , do not show this kind of behavior .",
    "instead , the so called _ scale - free networks _ , a model of which was first proposed by barabsis and albert  @xcite , seem to be closer to real life networks . in these networks",
    ", @xmath58 follows a power - law distribution : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are positive constants .    in scale - free networks , while most nodes have a low degree , there is a small but non - negligible number of highly connected nodes .",
    "this structure has a profound influence on the dynamics of processes taking place on those networks .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this model has been recently criticized @xcite as it turns out that , upon close inspection , many empirical data - sets in the literature that were previously assumed to have a power - low distribution are better modeled by alternative distributions .",
    "poisson , exponential , and power - law distributions are characteristic of model random and scale - free graphs respectively .",
    "the empirical distribution functions found for real - life graphs are seldom of this type though , because it is almost impossible to find such `` pure '' networks among finite sampled ones .",
    "however , most real networks have degree distributions that are fat - tailed , i.e. the right part of the distribution extends to regions that would have negligible probability for a poisson distribution ; in other words , nodes with high degree exist with non - negligible probability .",
    "two distributions that have been useful to fit real data are the _ power - law with exponential cutoff _ and the _ stretched exponential_. both forms take into account that in a finite network there must be a maximum finite degree . as an example , the following is an exponentially - truncated power - law : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a  critical connectivity \" .",
    "when @xmath29 approaches @xmath72 the exponential term tends to @xmath45 and @xmath58 decreases faster than a power - law due to the exponential cutoff .    to conclude , we can say that the degree distribution function , together with the other statistics , are a kind of rough `` signature '' of the type of network and can be helpful in predicting the main aspects of the properties of the network .",
    "the reader should be aware that there are other measures beyond those described here , such as those that say which are the most `` central '' actors .",
    "likewise , the picture has been one of static networks : their dynamical properties , have been neglected here .",
    "a good source for advanced material is  @xcite .",
    "weighted networks are a useful extension of the network model .",
    "weights @xmath73 are assigned to edges @xmath74 and could represent , for instance , the bandwidth of a communication line , the number of passengers transported on a given air route , the distance between two metro stations , and many other real - life aspects of networks . here , weights will represent transition probabilities among optima and their basins in fitness landscapes .",
    "we denote @xmath75 as the transition probability between local optima @xmath48 and @xmath21 , which in our model is generally different than the transition from @xmath21 to @xmath48 , denoted by @xmath76 ( see section [ edges ] for more details ) .",
    "statistics for weighted networks are more or less straightforward extensions of those used for unweighted networks . those that will be used in the rest of the chapter are briefly outlined below .",
    "the reader is refereed to  @xcite for more details .",
    "suitable distribution functions can also be defined for weighted networks . for example , it can be of interest to know the function @xmath77 which indicates the frequency of weight @xmath78 among the edges @xmath32 in a given weighted network .",
    "since our networks are directed , we use @xmath79 and @xmath80 which give the probability that any given edge @xmath32 has incoming or outgoing weight @xmath78 .    [ [ strength . ] ] strength .",

    "[ [ weighted - clustering - coefficient . ] ] weighted clustering coefficient .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the standard clustering coefficient ( described in section [ graph - stat ] ) does not consider weighted edges .",
    "we thus use the _ weighted clustering _ measure proposed by  @xcite , which combines the topological information with the weight distribution of the network :    @xmath84 where @xmath81 is the vertex strength , @xmath82 , @xmath85 if @xmath86 , @xmath87 if @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this metric @xmath90 counts , for each triple formed in the neighborhood of vertex @xmath48 ( indicated in the equation by @xmath91 ) , the weight of the two participating edges of vertex @xmath48 .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    for weighted graphs , computing the shortest paths depends on the meaning of the edge weights .",
    "for example , if the weight represents e.g. a frequency of interaction , an electrical load , the number of passengers transported or a probability of transition , then the higher the weight , the `` nearer '' the two end points . in this case the path length between any two connected vertices is taken as the sum of the reciprocal of the weights @xmath97 where the sum is over all edges @xmath98 traversed along the path from the start node to the end node . on the other hand , if weights represent `` costs '' of some kind and the aim is to have low total cost , then the length is simply the sum of the costs of all edges along the path and the minimal length is that of the path with minimum cost .    in the local optima network model , we measure the shortest distance between two nodes as the expected number of operator moves to go from one node to the other .",
    "given that the transition probability between two nodes @xmath48 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath75 , we calculate the distance between them as @xmath99 .",

    "a last theme in this section that we want to treat briefly is the `` intermediate '' structure of large networks since it will play a role in the following and is an important feature of complex networks .",
    "model networks grown according to the barabsi ",
    "albert recipe @xcite or randomly generated have little structure in the sense that there are few or no recognizable sub - networks .",
    "that is , if one looks at a picture of the network it appears to be rather homogeneous on a global scale .    on the contrary , many observed networks , especially those arising from social interactions , show the presence of clusters of nodes .",
    "these clusters are called _",
    "communities_. it is difficult , if not impossible , to give a precise and unique mathematical definition of a community .",
    "an intuitive definition of a community is the following : nodes belonging to a community are more strongly associated with each other than they are with the rest of the network . in other words , the intra - community connectivity is higher than the inter - community connectivity .",
    "of course , the definition is somewhat circular but in the last few years several algorithms have been proposed for community detection . since this task is a hard computational problem , machine learning algorithms and heuristics have been used and in practice these work satisfactorily .",

    "the @xmath103 variables that form the context of the fitness contribution of gene @xmath81 can be chosen according to different models .",
    "the two most widely studied models are the _ random neighborhood _ model , where the @xmath103 variables are chosen randomly according to a uniform distribution among the @xmath62 variables other than @xmath81 , and the _ adjacent neighborhood _ model , in which the @xmath103 variables are closest to @xmath81 in a total ordering @xmath111 ( using periodic boundaries ) .",

    "therefore , the study in this chapter considers the more general random model .",
    "the quadratic assignment problem ( qap ) is a combinatorial problem in which a set of facilities with given flows has to be assigned to a set of locations with given distances in such a way that the sum of the product of flows and distances is minimized .",

    "several questions can be raised .",
    "are they uniformly distributed , or do they cluster in some non - homogeneous way ?",
    "if the latter , what is the relation between objective function values within and among different clusters and how easy is it to go from one to another ?",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : community ] , clusters or communities in networks are groups of nodes that are strongly connected between them and poorly connected with the rest of the graph .",
    "the topological distribution of local optima can be directly investigated by means of community detection on the local optima network . in  @xcite",
    ", we conducted a community detection study on the two classes of qap instances .",
    "problems of size of @xmath125 for the real - like class and @xmath126 for the uniform class were considered as lons for these two cases have comparable sizes in terms of number of vertices .",
    "community detection is a difficult task , but today several good approximate algorithms are available  @xcite . in  @xcite , we used two of them : ( i ) a method based on greedy modularity optimization , and ( ii ) a spin glass ground state - based algorithm in order to double check the community partition results . figure  [ fig : box - qap ] shows the modularity score ( @xmath127 ) distribution for each algorithm / instance - class . the higher the @xmath127 score of a partition , the crisper the community structure  @xcite .",
    "the plot indicates that the two instance classes are well separated in terms of @xmath127 , regardless of the algorithm used .     on the y - axis with respect to class problem ( rl stands for real - like and uni stands for random uniform ) and community detection algorithm ( 1 stands for fast greedy modularity optimization and 2 stands for spin glass search algorithm).,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the real - like instances have significantly more cluster structure than the uniform instances",
    "this can be appreciated visually in fig .",
    "[ fig : qap - comm ] illustrating the community structures of two particular instances .",
    "these two selected cases have the highest @xmath127 values of their respective classes , but they represent a general trend . for the real - like instance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qap - comm ] , right ) the groups of local optima are recognizable and form well separated clusters ( encircled with dotted lines ) , which is also reflected in the high corresponding modularity value @xmath128 .",
    "in contrast , the the lon of the uniform instance ( fig .  [",
    "fig : qap - comm ] , left ) has some modularity , with a @xmath129 , but the communities are hard to represent graphically , and thus are not shown in the picture .",
    "the lons community structure is likely to have consequences on the heuristic algorithms used to search the corresponding landscapes .",
    "according to the level of modularity , different search strategies would be more efficient . for example",
    ", we can envision that for real - like instances , a local search algorithm may require stronger perturbation mechanisms to escape a cluster of local optima with poor quality solutions .",

    "a network - based model of combinatorial landscapes is described and a thorough analysis is presented for two example combinatorial landscapes : @xmath0 landscapes and the quadratic assignment problem .",
    "a network model requires defining its nodes and edges .",
    "nodes are the landscape local optima obtained with a best - improvement hill - climbing algorithm ; edges are defined in two alternative ways : one is based on the transition probabilities between basins of attraction , the other on the transition ( escape ) probabilities from local optima .",
    "the model , therefore , compresses the fitness landscapes into a more manageable mathematical object .",
    "new features can be measured in this model , coming from the science of complex networks such as the degree distribution , clustering coefficient , shortest path length , disparity and community structure .",
    "results from the studied landscapes show that local optima networks share some features with complex networks : basin sizes are not uniformly distributed , weight distributions are not normal , path lengths to the global optimum can be short , clustering coefficients can be high , and networks can have community structure .",
    "the results clearly show that the search difficulty on the studied landscapes , which may be either known a priori or empirically estimated , correlate with some fundamental lon features such as the number of nodes , size of basins , shortest path length to the global optimum , out - degree , disparity , and degree of assortativity .",
    "indeed , some of these metrics were used successfully to construct a statistical predictive model of search performance .",
    "the network analysis also revealed interesting topological differences on the distribution of local optima for different classes of problem instances .",
    "these differences may lead to designing search heuristics that can adapt and thus exploit the landscape structure .",
    "local optima networks can be seen as a generic model of combinatorial landscapes based on defining convergence points of simple heuristics in the search space . in this work ,",
    "the convergence points are local optima , and edges are transition probabilities between these points which also reflect the path of a local search . from a mathematical point of view , lons reduce the study of the whole transition matrix between solutions of a local search by a smaller transition matrix between local optima .",
    "the search dynamic is then decomposed into two time scales : one to reach local optima , the other to traverse between local optima . from lon graphs and their corresponding transition matrices",
    ", it should be possible to conduct a markov chain analysis and thus compute running times or expected performance .",
    "another research direction is to use lons for automated parameter tuning and design of heuristic search methods .",
    "some network metrics can be estimated without knowing the global optimum beforehand .",
    "these metrics coupled with adequate performance prediction models open up exciting possibilities .",
    "our current analysis requires the exhaustive enumeration of the search space ; with standard sampling methods , larger search spaces could be studied .",
