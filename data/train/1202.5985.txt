    "biometrics  @xcite is a technology allowing to recognize people through various personal factors .",
    "it is an active research field which design new biometric traits from time to time ( like finger knuckle recognition  @xcite ) .",
    "we can classify the various biometric modalities among three main families :    * _ biological _ : the recognition is based on the analysis of biological data linked to an individual ( _ e.g _ , dna , eeg analysis , ... ) . * _ behavioural _ : the recognition is based on the analysis of the behaviour of an individual while he is performing a specific task ( _ e.g _ , signature dynamics , gait , ... ) . * _ morphological _ : the recognition is based on the recognition of different physical patterns , which are , in general , permanent and unique ( _ e.g _ , fingerprint , face recognition , ... ) .",
    "it is mandatory to evaluate these biometric systems in order to quantify their performance and compare them .",
    "these biometric systems must be evaluated in order to compare them , or to quantify their performance . to evaluate a biometric system ,",
    "a database must be acquired ( or a common public dataset must be used ) .",
    "this database must contain as many users as possible to provide a large number of captures of their biometric data .",
    "these data are separated into two different sets :    * _ the learning _ set which serves to compute the biometric reference of each user * _ the validating _ set which serves to compute their performance .    when comparing test samples to biometric references , we obtain two different kinds of scores :    * _ the intrascores _ represent comparison scores between the biometric reference ( computed thanks to the learning set ) of an individual and biometric query samples ( contained in the validating set ) * _ the interscores _ represent comparison scores between the biometric reference of an individual and the biometric query samples of the other individuals .    from these two sets of scores ,",
    "we can compute various error rates , from which the eer is one functioning point which represents a very interesting error rate often used to compare biometric systems . in order to have reliable results ,",
    "it is necessary to evaluate the performance of biometric system with huge datasets .",
    "these huge datasets produce numbers of scores .",
    "as the time to evaluate the performance of a biometric system depends on the quantity of available scores , we can see that evaluation may become very long on these large datasets . in this paper , we present a very fast way to compute this error rate , as well as its confidence interval in a non parametric way , on different datasets of the literature",
    ".    nevertheless , there will always be users for which one modality ( or method applied to this modality ) will give bad results .",
    "these low performances can be implied by different facts : the quality of the capture , the acquisition conditions , or the individual itself .",
    "biometric multi - modality ( or multibiometrics ) allows to compensate this problem while obtaining better biometric performances ( _ i.e. _ , better security by accepting less impostors , and better usability by rejecting less genuine users ) by expecting that the errors of the different modalities are not correlated .",
    "so , the aim of multibiometrics is to protect logical or physical access to a resource by using different biometric captures .",
    "we can find different types of multibiometrics systems .",
    "most of them are listed in  @xcite , they use :    1 .",
    "different sensors of the same modality ( _ i.e. _ , capacitive or resistive sensors for fingerprint acquisition ) ; 2 .",
    "different representations of the same capture ( _ i.e. _ , use of points of interest or texture ) ; 3 .",
    "different biometric modalities ( _ i.e. _ , face and fingerprint ) ; 4 .",
    "several instances of the same modality ( _ i.e. _ , left and right eye for iris recognition ) ; 5 .",
    "multiple captures ( _ i.e. _ , 25 images per second in a video used for face recognition ) ; 6 .   an hybrid system composed of the association of the previous ones .    in the proposed study , we are interested in the first four kinds of multi - modality .",
    "we also present in this paper , a new multibiometrics approach using various fusion functions parametrized by genetic algorithms using a fast eer ( equal error rate ) computing method to speed up the fitness evaluation .",
    "this paper is related to high performance computing , because algorithms are designed to work in an infrastructure managing the biometric authentication of millions of individuals ( _ i.e. _ , border access control , logical acces control to webservices ) . to improve the recognition rate of biometric systems , it is necessary to regularly update the biometric reference to take into account intra class variability . with the proposed approach , the time taken to update the biometric reference would be lowered .",
    "the faster is the proposed method , the more we can launch the updating process ( or the more users we can add to the process ) .",
    "we also propose an adaptation of the proposed eer computing method which gives confidence intervals in a non parametric way ( _ i.e. _ , by computing the eer several times through a bootstraping method ) .",
    "the confidence intervals are computed on a single cpu , on several cpus on the same machine and on several machines .",
    "+ the main hints of the papers are :    * the proposition of a new method to approximate the eer and its confidence interval in a fast way * the proposition of two original functions for multibiometrics fusion .",
    "the plan is organized as following .",
    "section 2 presents the background of the proposed work .",
    "section 3 presents the proposed method for computing the approximated value of the eer and its confidence interval .",
    "section 4 validates them .",
    "section 5 presents the proposed multibiometrics fusion functions and their performance in term of biometric recognition and computation time against the baseline .",
    "section 6 gives perspectives and conclusions of this paper .",
    "despite the obvious advantages of this technology in enhancing and facilitating the authentication process , its proliferation is still not as much as attended @xcite . as argued in the previous section , biometric systems present several drawbacks in terms of precision , acceptability , quality and security .",
    "hence , evaluating biometric systems is considered as a challenge in this research field .",
    "nowadays , several works have been done in the literature to evaluate such systems .",
    "evaluating biometric systems is generally realized within three aspects as illustrated in figure [ fig : evaluation_aspects ] : usability , data quality and security .",
    "( root ) [ event ] evaluation of biometric systems childnode ( data quality ) data quality childnode ( usability ) usability childnode ( quantitative ) quantitative childnode ( efficiency ) efficiency childnode ( effectiveness ) effectiveness childnode ( qualitative ) qualitative childnode ( acceptance and user satisfaction ) acceptance and user satisfaction childnode ( security ) security ;      according to the international organization for standardization iso 13407:1999 @xcite , usability is defined as `` _ _ the extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness , efficiency , and satisfaction in a specified context of use _ _ '' .",
    "* _ efficiency _ which means that users must be able to accomplish the tasks easily and in a timely manner .",
    "it is generally measured as task time ; * _ effectiveness _ which means that users are able to complete the desired tasks without too much effort .",
    "it is generally measured by common metrics include completion rate and number of errors such failure - to - enroll rate ( fte ) @xcite ; * _ user satisfaction _ which measures users acceptance and satisfaction regarding the system .",
    "it is generally measured by studying several properties such as easiness to use , trust in the system , _ etc . _",
    "the acceptability of biometric systems is affected by several factors . according to @xcite",
    ", some members of the human - computer interaction ( hci ) community believe that interfaces of security systems do not reflect good thinking in terms of creating a system that is easy to use , while maintaining an acceptable level of security .",
    "existing works @xcite show also that there is a potential concern about the misuse of personal data ( _ i.e. _ , templates ) which is seen as violating users privacy and civil liberties .",
    "moreover , one of our previous work @xcite shows the necessity of taking into account users acceptance and satisfaction when designing and evaluating biometric systems .",
    "more generally speaking , even if the performance of a biometric system outperformed another one , this will not necessarily mean that it will be more operational or acceptable ; +      it measures the quality of the biometric raw data @xcite .",
    "low quality samples increase the enrollment failure rate , and decrease system performance .",
    "therefore , quality assessment is considered as a crucial factor required in both the enrollment and verification phases . using quality information ,",
    "the bad quality samples can be removed during enrollment or rejected during verification .",
    "such information could also be used in soft biometrics or multimodal approaches @xcite .",
    "such type of assessment is generally used to quantify biometric sensors , and could be also used to enhance system performance ; +      it measures the robustness of a biometric system ( algorithms , architectures and devices ) against attacks .",
    "many works in the literature @xcite show the vulnerabilities of biometric systems which can considerably decrease their security .",
    "hence , the evaluation of biometric systems in terms of security is considered as an important factor to ensure its functionality . the international organization for standardization iso / iec fcd 19792 @xcite addresses the aspects of security evaluation of such systems .",
    "the report presents an overview of biometric systems vulnerabilities and provide some recommendations to be taking into account during the evaluation process .",
    "nowadays , only few partial security analysis studies with relation to biometric authentication systems exist . according to iso / iec fcd 19792 @xcite , the security evaluation of biometric systems is generally divided into two complementary assessments : 1 ) assessment of the biometric system ( devices and algorithms ) and 2 ) assessment of the environmental ( for example , is the system is used indoor or outdoor ? ) and operational conditions ( for example , tasks done by system administrators to ensure that the claimed identities during enrolment of the users are valid ) .",
    "a type-1 security assessment method is presented in a personal previous work @xcite .",
    "the proposed method has shown its efficiency in evaluating and comparing biometric systems .",
    "the performance evaluation of biometric systems is now carefully considered in biometric research area .",
    "we need a reliable evaluation methodology in order to put into obviousness the benefit of a new biometric system . nowadays ,",
    "many efforts have been done to achieve this objective .",
    "we present in section [ sec : performance_evaluation ] an overview of the performance metrics , followed by the research benchmarks in biometrics as an illustration of the evaluation methodologies used in the literature for the comparison of biometric systems .",
    "by contrast to traditional methods , biometric systems do not provide a cent per cent reliable answer , and it is quite impossible to obtain such a response .",
    "the comparison result between the acquired biometric sample and its corresponding stored template is illustrated by a distance score .",
    "if the score is lower than the predefined decision threshold , then the system accepts the claimant , otherwise he is rejected .",
    "this threshold is defined according to the security level required by the application .",
    "figure [ fig : scores_distribution ] illustrates the theoretical distribution of the genuine and impostor scores .",
    "this figure shows that errors depend from the used threshold .",
    "hence , it is important to quantify the performance of biometric systems .",
    "the international organization for standardization iso / iec 19795 - 1 @xcite proposes several statistical metrics to characterize the performance of a biometric system such as :    * _ failure - to - enroll rate ( fte ) _ : proportion of the user population for whom the biometric system fails to capture or extract usable information from biometric sample ; * _ failure - to - acquire rate ( fta ) _ : proportion of verification or identification attempts for which a biometric system is unable to capture a sample or locate an image or signal of sufficient quality ; * _ false acceptation rate ( far ) _ and _ false rejection rate ( frr ) _ : far is the proportion of impostors that are accepted by the biometric system , while the frr is the proportion of authentic users that are incorrectly denied .",
    "the computation of these error rates is based on the comparison of the scores against a threshold ( the direction of the comparison is reversed if the scores represent similarities instead of distances ) .",
    "frr and far are respectively computed ( in the case of a distance score ) as in ( [ eq : frr ] ) and ( [ eq : far ] ) , where @xmath0 ( respectively @xmath1 ) means the intra score at position @xmath2 in the set of intra score ( respectively inter score at position @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 is the cardinal of the set in argument , @xmath4 is the decision threshold , and @xmath5 is the indicator function .",
    "+ @xmath6 + @xmath7 * _ receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve _ : the roc curve is obtained by computing the couple of ( far , frr ) for each tested threshold .",
    "it plots the frr versus the far .",
    "the aim of this curve is to present the tradeoff between far and frr and to have a quick overview of the system performance and security for all the parameters configurations . *",
    "_ equal error rate ( eer ) _ : it is the value where both errors rates , far and frr , are equals ( _ i.e. _ , far = frr ) .",
    "it constitutes a good indicator , and the most used , to evaluate and compare biometric systems . in other words , lower the eer value is , higher the accuracy of the system . using the roc curve ,",
    "the eer is computed by selecting the couple of ( far , frr ) having the smallest absolute difference ( [ eq : precision ] ) at the given threshold @xmath8 : + @xmath9 + and returning their average ( [ eq : eer ] ) : + @xmath10 + by this way , we have obtained the best approaching eer value with the smallest precision error .",
    "the classical eer computing algorithm is presented in the figure  [ fig : sloweer ] . from figure",
    "[ fig : sloweer ] , we can see that the complexity is in @xmath11 with @xmath12 the number of thresholds held in the computation , and , @xmath13 the number of scores in the dataset .",
    "as it is impossible to reduce @xmath13 , we have to find a better method which reduces @xmath12 .",
    "we did not find , in the literature , methods allowing to reduce computation time in order to obtain this eer .",

    "it takes a lot of time and energy to build a large and significant dataset .",
    "it is very convenient to download one for research purposes .",
    "we present in this section an overview of the used datasets in this paper .",
    "table [ tab : databases ] presents a summary of these datasets .    * * biometric scores set - release 1 ( bssr1 ) * + the bssr1  @xcite database is an ensemble of scores sets from different biometric systems . in this study , we are interested in the subset containing the scores of two facial recognition systems and the two scores of a fingerprint recognition system applied to two different fingers for @xmath28 users .",

    "* private * + the last database is a chimeric one we have created for this purpose by combining two public biometric template databases : the ar  @xcite for the facial recognition and the greyc keystroke  @xcite for keystroke dynamics  @xcite .",

    "we can see that this improvement depends both on the cardinal of the set of scores and the function to evaluate : there are better improvements for ( [ eq : ga1 ] ) .",
    "the best gain is about 78% while the smallest is about 28% .",
    "once again , we can observe the interest of our eer estimation method which allows to obtain results far quickly .",
    "we can note that the generated function all generate a monotonically decreasing roc curve which allows to use our method .",
    "if the roc curve does not present this shape , we would be unable to obtain the estimated eer ( such drawbacks as been experimented using genetic programming  @xcite instead of genetic algorithms ) .",
    "the contribution of this paper is twofold : a fast approximated eer computing method ( associated to its confidence interval ) , and two score fusion functions having to be parametrized thanks to genetic algorithms .",
    "using these two contributions together allows to speed up the computation time of the genetic algorithm because its fitness function consists on computing the eer ( thus , allows to use a bigger population ) .",
    "the fast eer computing method has been validated on five different biometric systems and compared to the classical way .",
    "experimental results showed the benefit of the proposed method , in terms of precision of the eer value and timing computation .",
    "the score fusion functions have been validated on three significant multibiometrics databases ( two reals and one chimerical ) having a different number of scores .",
    "the fusion functions parametrized by genetic algorithm always outperform simple state of the art simple functions ( @xmath37 , @xmath39 , @xmath38 ) , and , the two new fusion functions have given better are equal results than the simple weighted sum . using the proposed fast eer computing method",
    "also considerably speed up the timing computation of the genetic algorithms .",
    "these better results imply that the multibiometrics system has a better security ( fewer impostors can be accepted ) and is more pleasant to be used ( fewer genuine users can be rejected ) .",
    "one limitation of the proposed method is related to the shape of the roc curve and the atended precision wanted . in some cases ,",
    "the method is unable to get the eer at the wanted precision , and , is not able to return the result ( we did not encounter this case in these experiments ) .",
    "our next research will focus on the use of different evolutionary algorithms in order to generate other kind of complex functions allowing to get better results .",
