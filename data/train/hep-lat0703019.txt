    "the origin of mass is one of the fundamental and fascinating subjects in physics for a long time .",
    "a standard interpretation of mass origin is the yukawa interaction with the higgs field @xcite , of which observation is one of the most important aims of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment at cern .",
    "however , the mass of higgs origin is only about 1% of total mass in the world , because the higgs interaction only provides the current quark mass ( less than 10mev for light quarks ) and the lepton mass ( 0.51mev for electrons ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "apart from unknown dark matter , about 99% of mass of matter in the world originates from the strong interaction , which actually provides the large constituent quark mass @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "such a dynamical fermion - mass generation in the strong interaction can be interpreted as spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , which was first pointed out by y.  nambu  et  al .",
    "@xcite . according to the chiral symmetry breaking , light quarks are considered to have a large constituent quark mass of about @xmath24 @xcite . in terms of the mass - generation mechanism , it is interesting to investigate high density and/or high temperature systems , because chiral symmetry is expected to be restored in the system @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies suggest that such a restoration affects the hadron nature @xcite .",
    "actually , the experiments at cern sps @xcite and kek @xcite indicate the change of nature of the vector mesons @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath0 in finite density system .",
    "these experiments are important for the study of the mass generation originated from chiral symmetry breaking . in this way",
    ", the origin of mass and its related topics , including the higgs - particle search at lhc and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , are energetically studied in both sides of theories and experiments .",
    "then , a question arises : is there any mechanism of dynamical mass generation without chiral symmetry breaking ? to answer this question , we note the following examples supporting the existence of such a mechanism .",
    "one example is gluons , i.e. , colored vector particles in qcd . while the gluon is massless in perturbation qcd , non - perturbative effects due to the self - interaction of gluons seem to generate a large effective gluon mass as @xmath27 , which is measured in lattice qcd @xcite",
    "actually , glueballs , which are composed of gluons , have a large mass , e.g. , about @xmath28 @xcite even for the lightest glueball ( @xmath29 ) , and the scalar meson @xmath30 is one of the candidate of the lowest @xmath31 glueball in experimental side @xcite .",
    "another example is charm quarks .",
    "the current mass of charm quarks is about @xmath32 at the renormalization point @xmath33 @xcite . in the quark model , however , the constituent charm - quark mass which reproduces masses of charmonia is set to be about @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the about 400mev difference between the current and the constituent charm - quark masses can be explained as dynamical mass generation without chiral symmetry breaking , since there is no chiral symmetry for such a heavy - quark system .",
    "these examples suggest that there is another type of mass generation without chiral symmetry breaking and the higgs mechanism .",
    "then , we conjecture that , even without chiral symmetry breaking , large dynamical mass generation generally occurs in the strong interaction , i.e. , _ all colored particles have a large effective mass generated by dressed gluon effects . _",
    "this is one of the main motivations of the present study on the mass generation of the hadronic systems including light scalar - quarks , which do not have the chiral symmetry .",
    "the study is also motivated by the `` diquark picture '' of hadrons @xcite .",
    "the diquark is made of two quarks which are strongly correlated in color anti - triplet @xmath35 channel , where the one - gluon - exchange interaction between two quarks is most attractive .",
    "sometimes , diquarks are treated as point - like objects or local boson fields .",
    "degrees of freedom of diquarks seems to be important in some aspects of hadron physics .",
    "for example , nucleon structure functions can be explained by the model in which nucleon is the admixture of a diquark and a quark @xcite .",
    "diquarks are also important for hadron spectra @xcite . in an extremely high density system ,",
    "diquark condensation is considered to appear due to the attractive interaction of one - gluon exchange in color @xmath35 channel . such a phase is called color superconductivity phase @xcite and it may exist in the interior of neutron stars . however , the properties of diquarks such as the size and the mass are not well understood , in spite of the frequent use of diquarks in hadron physics .",
    "we note that point - like limit of diquarks in color @xmath35 channel can be regarded as the scalar - quark in fundamental representation of su(3)@xmath2 in scalar qcd @xcite .",
    "therefore , the theoretical study of scalar - quarks with a reliable method is expected to be a good test place to check the validity of the point - like diquark picture .    in this paper , according to these motivations , we study the light scalar - quark belonging to the fundamental representation of su(3)@xmath2 , and their color - singlet hadronic states using quenched su(3)@xmath2 lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "we investigate `` scalar - quark hadrons '' , which are the color - singlet bound states of scalar - quarks @xmath0 , and `` chimera hadrons '' , which are the bound states of @xmath0 and ( ordinary ) quarks @xmath8 . using the standard technique of the lattice gauge theory",
    ", we calculate the temporal correlators of these new - type hadrons at the quenched level , and extract their mass of the lowest energy state from the correlators . as a result , we find a large mass of the hadron including scalar - quarks @xmath0 . also we find the `` constituent scalar - quark / quark picture '' for all the new - type hadrons .",
    "namely , the mass of the new - type hadron which is composed of @xmath14 @xmath0 s and @xmath15 @xmath8 s , @xmath36 , satisfies @xmath37 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the constituent scalar - quark and quark masses , respectively .",
    "the constituent scalar - quark mass @xmath18 estimated from the masses of these new - type hadrons is found to be much larger than the constituent quark mass @xmath38 for light quarks .",
    "this result suggests that , in the system of colored scalar particles , there occurs large mass generation in the strong interaction without chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the new states including scalar - quarks , `` scalar - quark hadrons '' and `` chimera hadrons '' , are introduced . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we present the formalism of lattice qcd including scalar - quarks , the setup of the lattice calculations , and the method to extract the masses of the new - type hadrons . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we show the numerical results of the scalar - quark hadrons , i.e. , scalar - quark mesons @xmath6 and scalar - quark baryons @xmath7 , and investigate the constituent scalar - quark picture and mass generation of scalar - quarks . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we show the numerical results of the chimera hadrons , i.e. , chimera mesons @xmath9 and chimera baryons @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and analyse them in terms of the constituent scalar - quark / quark picture and their structure . sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "the lattice result for the scalar - quark mass at @xmath39 is summarized in table viii .",
    "we show in fig.13 the relation between the scalar - quark mass @xmath40 and the bare scalar - quark mass @xmath41 at @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath42-dependence of @xmath43 is found to be approximately linear . similar to the case at @xmath3 , this behavior can be explained with the constituent scalar - quark picture of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being almost @xmath41-independent . at @xmath47=6.10 , the scalar - quark meson mass @xmath40 at @xmath12",
    "is found to be about 5.5gev , and thus the self - energy for scalar - quarks is estimated as @xmath48 , which is about twice larger than that at @xmath47=5.70 .",
    "we compare the lattice result at @xmath39 with that at @xmath3 for the scalar - quark meson mass @xmath49 in the case of @xmath12 , because of @xmath50 in the constituent picture . for @xmath12",
    ", we find the approximate scaling relation as @xmath51 which indicates a large quantum correction as @xmath52 mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] . in this way , if one considers the point - like scalar - quark , its self - energy @xmath46 diverges in the continuum limit , and hence , to eliminate the divergence depending on the cutoff , one needs a fine tuning of the bare scalar - quark mass @xmath41 .",
    "for the argument of the diquark , however , there appears a natural cutoff corresponding to its intrinsic size as a composite object .",
