    "in contrast with the dissipative case , the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ solve ] ) now dominates , and it grows exponentially as @xmath280 . since the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ solve ] ) is of order unity , the constant @xmath281 must be equal to one .",
    "on the other hand , the constant @xmath281 is evaluated using the stirling formula @xmath282 to give .",
    "equating @xmath283 , we arrive at @xmath284 while the exponent rises linearly with the dimension , it exhibit different @xmath3-dependence . numerical solution of @xmath285 shows that this large dimension estimate again yields a useful approximation even at moderate dimensions .",
    "several recent studies have used a distribution of restitution coefficients to model driven granular systems , including for example , a one - dimensional gas of rods with internal degrees of freedom @xcite , and vertically vibrated layers @xcite . by tuning the distribution properly , one can have a situation were overall , energy is conserved as dissipative collisions are balanced by energy generating collisions . when the restitution coefficient is drawn from the distribution @xmath286 ,",
    "one simply integrates the collision integral in the boltzmann equation ( [ be ] ) with respect to the measure @xmath286 . in one dimension , one can check that the scaling solution @xmath287 still holds , and in particular the exponent @xmath104 is robust . in general dimension ,",
    "the exponent @xmath86 is given by @xmath288 with the decay rate @xmath289 .",
    "we conclude that algebraic large - velocity statistics extend to situations where the dissipation coefficient @xmath3 is drawn from a given distribution .",
    "we have studied inelastic gases within the framework of the maxwell model , a boltzmann equation with a uniform collision rate .",
    "we have shown that this kinetic theory is analytically tractable as closed evolution equations characterize the fourier transform and consequently moments of the velocity distribution . in the freely evolving case ,",
    "the system approaches a scaling regime , and the velocity distribution has an algebraic large velocity tail .",
    "the corresponding exponent varies continuously with the spatial dimension and the degree of dissipation .",
    "the decay exponents can be very large and therefore it may be difficult to distinguish a power law from a stretched exponential . in the driven case , we have determined the cumulants of the velocity distribution .",
    "the time dependent behavior displays a number of interesting features . moments of the velocity distribution exhibit multiscaling asymptotic behavior , and knowledge of the typical velocity is insufficient to characterize all moments .",
    "the velocity autocorrelation decays algebraically with time , and the corresponding exponent depends on the restitution coefficient only .",
    "in contrast with elastic collisions , stochastic inelastic collision processes are not effective in mixing particle velocities .",
    "the stronger the inelasticity , the stronger the history dependence , i.e. , memory of previous behavior .",
    "additionally , inelasticity can generate significant correlations between different velocity components .",
    "such correlations do develop even in the forced case , where dissipation is balanced by energy input , and one may expect that maxwellian velocity distribution emerge .    the maxwell model is truly mean field in nature with all aspects of the collision process being random . while it is not surprising that such a theory is solvable , the rich structure of the solution is somewhat unexpected .",
    "for example , the exponent follows from a transcendental equation , and can not be obtained from heuristic arguments or dimensional analysis .",
    "remarkably , even the leading asymptotic behavior in the large dimension limit remains nontrivial as it involves roots of cubic or transcendental equations .",
    "we have explored only the basic characteristics .",
    "clearly , one can study higher order velocity correlation measures as well as higher order autocorrelations .",
    "furthermore , the relaxation toward the steady state appears analytically tractable .",
    "the straightforward analysis is cumbersome and it may be useful to expand first the solutions in terms of more natural building blocks , e.g. , orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we stress that the maxwell model is exact for stochastic inelastic collision processes with random collision partners and impact angles",
    ". it may be applicable in situations where an effective stirring mechanism leads to perfect mixing .",
    "otherwise , it should be regarded as an uncontrolled approximation of the boltzmann equation .",
    "indeed , existing theoretical and numerical studies give little evidence for algebraic tails characterizing inelastic gases .",
    "the only exception was observed in a system with random restitution coefficients drawn from a broad distribution . in one dimension , both molecular dynamics simulation and direct integration of the boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres",
    "show that the velocity distribution has a power law tail @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results , combined with previous kinetic theory studies that find exponential , stretched exponential , and gaussian tails , indicate that extremal velocity characteristics can be sensitive to the details of the model , let alone parameters such as the restitution coefficient , and the dimension .",
