    "entropies are measures of the information missing from a coarse - grained description of a system .",
    "different coarse - grained descriptions give rise to different entropies .",
    "if an entropy is low at one time , it will have a general tendency to grow as its coarse - graining is translated forward in time .",
    "that is the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "usually , entropy is constructed from a coarse - grained description at a single moment in time .",
    "for example , if all that is known of the state of a system at a particular time is its total energy , the missing information is the entropy of the microcanonical ensemble  a quantity which is independent of time .",
    "if all that is known at a time are the expected values of the energy , number , and momentum densities , averaged over volumes large enough to be in local equilibrium , then the missing information per volume is the time - dependent entropy density of hydrodynamics .",
    "the jaynes procedure @xcite gives a general method for constructing the entropy of a system at a moment of time .",
    "to illustrate , let @xmath0 be the phase space of a classical system and @xmath1 be the probability distribution representing the state of the system .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is a classical quantity whose expected value @xmath3 is known , where    @xmath4    the missing information @xmath5 is constructed by maximizing the entropy functional    @xmath6 \\label{onetwo}\\ ] ]    over all @xmath7 that imply the same expected value . in symbols ,    @xmath8    however , entropy need not only apply to coarse - grained alternatives at one moment in time .",
    "more generally , one can consider the missing information of a sequence of alternatives at a succession of times .",
    "these are the entropies of coarse - grained _ histories _ of the system .",
    "a variety of such entropies have been described ( _ e.g._@xcite ) and applied to measures of coarse - graining@xcite , classicality@xcite , and effective complexity@xcite . in theories which possess a notion of history but lack a fixed notion of time ( such as certain formulations of quantum gravity @xcite )",
    "the missing information of histories may be the only notion of entropy available .    in this paper",
    "we examine the entropy of histories for classical stochastic systems  classical systems with a probabilistic law of evolution ( including deterministic evolution as a special case ) .",
    "we use isham s history space @xcite and a generalization of the jaynes procedure to give a unified view of several different kinds of entropies for histories and describe relations among them .",
    "we illustrate with numerical calculations in some simple examples .",
    "finally , we describe a modest generalization of the second law of thermodynamics applicable to the entropy of histories and test it in a simple model .",
    "our considerations are almost entirely classical , but in section v we point the way to generalizations for the quantum mechanical case .",
    "we consider classical theories with ( most generally ) a stochastic evolution law in a space @xmath0 through a finest - grained net of @xmath9 times separated by equal intervals @xmath10 .",
    "for this discussion the space @xmath0 could be a configuration space of particle positions , a spatial lattice , or a phase space .",
    "we denote a point in @xmath0 by @xmath11 .",
    "the cases when @xmath0 is a discrete space or a continuous manifold differ only formally , and can to a large extent be treated together by using a common notation .",
    "we define    [ twoone ] @xmath12 when @xmath0 is discrete , and @xmath13 when m is continuous .",
    "this notation is suggestive for the quantum mechanical case to be treated later .",
    "we also define @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the unit function on @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath16 is an integer when @xmath0 is discrete and a real number when @xmath0 is continuous .",
    "a fine - grained history is described by a sequence of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath9 for each of the finest - grained net of times .",
    "histories are therefore naturally thought of as living in a classical  history space \" @xmath20 , with one factor for each fine - grained time .",
    "a point in @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath22 , and corresponds to a fine - grained history .",
    "this is the classical analog of the  history space \" introduced by isham @xcite , and used so effectively in quantum theory by isham and linden @xcite , and isham , linden and schreckenberg @xcite .",
    "a coarse - grained set of alternative histories is a partition of the set @xmath23 of fine - grained histories into an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive regions or classes @xmath24 .",
    "each class is a single _ coarse - grained history_. we can usefully introduce projections onto these regions of @xmath23 ,    @xmath25    a sequence of coarse - grained alternatives at a series of times @xmath26 , @xmath19 , @xmath27 is an example of a coarse - grained history .",

    "@xmath43 satisfies    @xmath44    of course , @xmath43 may have special forms in particular circumstances .",
    "for example , for a markov process    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the distribution at the initial time and @xmath47 is the transition probability to arrive at @xmath11 in a time @xmath10 having started from @xmath48 .",
    "if @xmath0 were a classical phase space , deterministic evolution would be represented by ( [ twoseven ] ) with    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the phase - space point @xmath48 evolved by the time @xmath10 .",
    "the probability of a coarse - grained history is    @xmath51    for example , in the case of a sequence of alternatives like ( [ twothree ] ) at a series of times , and a markovian probability of the form ( [ twoseven ] ) ,    @xmath52    here @xmath53 is the composition of all the @xmath54 s from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the initial time , and @xmath58 is defined to be the probability of a coarse - grained history @xmath59 given that the system is initially at @xmath60 .",

    "the important property of @xmath63 is that it increases on coarse - graining .",

    "the expression ( [ a ] ) thus applies immediately in the classical case .",

    "we examine explicitly the behavior of history space entropy under fine - graining in three one - dimensional models with simple stochastic evolutionary laws .",
    "they are : a discrete random walk , continuous diffusion , and brownian motion .",
    "the random walk is the simplest model ; diffusion illustrates the modifications necessary for the continuum ; and brownian motion is a simple example of a non - markovian process . in all cases",
    "we consider a finest - grained net of @xmath9 equally - spaced times so that fine - grained histories are specified by @xmath9 positions @xmath140 .",
    "we consider coarse - grainings in which these positions are grouped into equal intervals of size @xmath141 at a series of times spaced by equal intervals @xmath142 .",
    "we then study history space entropy for these coarse - grainings as a function of @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we take an initial condition where all histories begin at the initial point @xmath143 and assume that at each timestep the particle has an equal chance of moving right ( @xmath144 ) or left ( @xmath145 ) on a discrete spatial lattice .",

    "we assume that the lattice has a large finite size @xmath16 with periodic boundary conditions relating its ends .",
    "the history space entropy is given by ( [ twofifteen ] ) where @xmath149 is the number of fine - grained histories in a coarse - grained history @xmath24 .",
    "for all histories with the coarse - graining described above this is : @xmath150    simple as this is , it is clear that as the number of fine - grained histories increases rapidly with the number of times @xmath151 , and calculating entropies by summing over all the fine - grained histories in each coarse - grained history rapidly becomes impractical .",
    "instead , we use a monte carlo approach : we generate a large sample of fine - grained histories , bin them together into coarse - grained classes , and calculate the entropies from the resulting probability estimates .",
    "this technique works in the continuous case as well .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the history space entropy @xmath65 of the random walk model as a function of the @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "we clearly see that the entropy rises steeply when the coarse - graining is increased by increasing @xmath142 and more moderately as @xmath141 is increased .",
    "increasing @xmath141 to @xmath16 at a fixed time gives the maximal coarse - graining where the only alternatives are @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , increasing @xmath141 to @xmath16 for any fixed value of @xmath142 will give the maximum possible entropy , associated with the alternative @xmath153 .",

    "the time - asymmetric increase of these entropies of the universe arises from a cosmological initial condition at which those entropies were low .",

    "the single - time entropy of these coarse - grainings is low in the early universe leading to a general tendency to increase .",
    "statements of the second law often refer to the increase of `` the '' entropy as though there were only one possible coarse - grained description for which it holds .",
    "what is meant by `` the '' entropy is usually the single - time entropy of the alternatives defining the quasiclassical realm of everyday experience described above .",
    "however , we should expect the general increase of the entropy of _ any _ set of coarse - grained alternatives which is low in the initial moments of the universe .",

    "the corresponding entropies of histories should also increase with time if they are low at the time of the system s initial condition .",
    "for example , consider a set of histories consisting of a series of alternatives @xmath240 at a sequence of time @xmath241 giving a histories entropy @xmath242 if @xmath65 is initially low , and these times are all translated forward by an amount @xmath243 , we would expect @xmath244 to increase with @xmath243 .",
