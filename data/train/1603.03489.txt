    "wave propagation through inhomogeneous materials is more subtle than an application of ray optics would suggest .",
    "when the material properties change on a scale that is comparable to the wavelength then the wave will reflect , and in general the reflection depends in an intricate way on the exact spatial dependence of the material properties . until relatively recently it was difficult to explore these subtle interactions of waves with matter , simply because the material properties could not be precisely specified as a function of position .",
    "however , this situation has now changed somewhat ; ` metamaterial ' structures  @xcite have been developed , where the material is engineered on a sub  wavelength scale so that it can be treated as a continuous function of position .",
    "such structures have been developed for controlling electromagnetic  @xcite , acoustic  @xcite , and water waves  @xcite , as well as diffusion phenomena such as heat  @xcite . to determine the necessary material properties to manipulate the wave in a desired way , one applies theories such as transformation optics  @xcite , which exploit the equivalence between inhomogeneous material properties and coordinate transformations .    the purpose of this paper is to explore how a different equivalence might be used to understand the effect of inhomogeneous media on the propagation of waves .",
    "we shall illustrate how a family of non  linear wave equations ( known as the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) hierarchy  @xcite ) can be used to manipulate the reflectivity of a planar electromagnetic material through ` evolving ' the permittivity profile @xmath0 from one functional form to another .",
    "although the literature on the relationship between the kdv hierarchy and the helmholtz equation is vast ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , the typical concern is with using the helmholtz equation as a tool for solving the kdv equation rather the reverse , and the possibility of investigating this relationship with metamaterial structures does not seem to have been considered .",
    "here we imagine a regime that seems to be possible with metamaterials , where we have a very fine control over an isotropic permittivity @xmath0 as a function of position , in comparison to the wavelength of interest , and that we can control both its real and imaginary parts .",
    "in the first part of this work we re  derive the result that ` evolving ' a permittivity profile @xmath0 in ` time ' according to the kdv equation leads to a continuous family of profiles that all have a reflectivity that is different only by a phase .",
    "this derivation is carried out in terms of the current that must be induced in a material when the permittivity profile is changed slightly . requiring that the radiation at @xmath1 produced by this current only change the field in a way that depends on field values infinitesimally close to @xmath1 leads us to the first two evolution equations in the kdv hierarchy .",
    "we then show that some recent results concerning reflectionless media  @xcite can be derived in the same way .",
    "the second part of the paper is concerned with the possible application of the kdv hierarchy to the design of planar permittivity profiles .",
    "we demonstrate the design of a family of complex materials that are reflectionless from both sides for all angles of incidence , and periodic planar media that do not exhibit a band gap for any angle of propagation .",
    "finally we demonstrate that the kdv equation can be used to modify an interface between two different values of the permittivity in such a way that the reflectivity is reduced for a range of angles of incidence . throughout this work",
    "we treat waves of a single frequency , and interest ourselves in manipulating the reflection of a planar medium as a function of angle .",
    "given the lack of many general statements one can make about wave propagation through inhomogeneous media , one line of attack is to separate out the possible functions @xmath0 into families that have closely related scattering properties .",
    "take for example monochromatic electromagnetic waves polarized along @xmath2 and propagating in the @xmath1@xmath3 plane through an inhomogeneous slab with complex permittivity @xmath4 .",

    "this results in a family of generally complex permittivity profiles with identical transmission coefficients , and reflection coefficients that change according to ( [ rev ] ) .",
    "an example of such an evolution is given by the korteweg  de vries equation ( [ kdvequation]).[schematic_fig],width=302 ]    equation ( [ field - change ] ) tells us that the field at a fixed position @xmath1 in the profile @xmath16 differs from that in @xmath17 generally depending on all other points in space . while this is not at all informative in the general case , this paper",
    "is concerned with those particular choices of evolution equation @xmath18 when the right hand side of ( [ field - change ] ) can be made to depend only on @xmath1 @xmath19 with @xmath20 some operator depending on @xmath21 and derivatives with respect to @xmath1 ( it is a local operator ) . to better understand the physical meaning of reducing ( [ field - change ] ) to ( [ local - operator ] ) , suppose we understand @xmath22 as a current , which is the source of radiation @xmath23 in ( [ field - change ] ) .",
    "our choice of @xmath24 that leads to ( [ local - operator ] ) amounts to a choice of envelope function within the current distribution @xmath25 such that the radiation that reaches @xmath1 from all other points in space cancels out , leaving only that coming from infinitesimally close to @xmath1 . that this is at all possible in any non  trivial cases is surprising , and as we shall see sometimes quite useful",
    "equation ( [ local - operator ] ) is of the same form as the time dependent schrdinger equation , and by analogy the general solution is a path ordered exponential  @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the theory we are discussing is that in many cases @xmath26 can be reduced to something independent of ` time ' ( ` @xmath11 ' ) when @xmath10 , because here the permittivity reduces to unity .",
    "the path ordering then ceases to matter and we have @xmath27 .",

    "this can be demonstrated in a rather elementary case , where the trajectory parameterized by ` @xmath11 ' simply corresponds to a translation of the permittivity profile in space .",
    "a family of permittivity profiles that are all of the same shape , but centred at different positions can be generated by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ` velocity ' at which the profile moves as a function of @xmath11 . substituting this into ( [ field - change ] ) , integrating by parts , and applying ( [ helmholtz ] ) and ( [ green ] ) we obtain @xmath38.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the boundary terms from the integral correspond to waves",

    "@xcite , an infinite set of increasingly complicated non  linear equations under the evolution of which the reflection coefficient transforms as ( [ rev ] ) .",
    "recent work  @xcite has shown that complex inhomogenous media satisfying the spatial kramers  kronig relations have curious scattering properties , being generally reflectionless from one side and in many cases having unit transmission . although not initially cast as such , this is also a case when the ` evolution ' of the field can be written asymptotically as a local operation ( [ local - operator ] ) , which we now briefly describe .",
    "suppose that our initial permittivity profile is vacuum @xmath65 , and that we consider a right  going wave @xmath66 . in this case",

    "we now consider the position as a complex variable @xmath70 , and take @xmath18 as an analytic function that tends to zero as @xmath10 in the upper half complex position plane . as we take ( [ field - derivative-0 ] ) towards infinity in the upper half plane the first term in the square brackets decays exponentially to zero as @xmath71 .",
    "the second term decays with the same exponent , as is clear if we successively integrate by parts to obtain e.g. for @xmath72 integrations @xmath73 for large @xmath72 the integral term on the second line becomes negligibly small as we move far into the upper half plane .",
    "therefore @xmath74 is analytic and asymptotically tends to zero in the upper half complex position plane . given that functions that are analytic in one half of the complex position have one  sided fourier ( @xmath75 ) spectra  @xcite this means that we can change the permittivity away from vacuum by adding in an inhomogeneous part that is analytic in one half of the complex position plane and we will not generate any counter propagating waves : _ there will be no reflection from the profile_. indeed , this is not just true for small changes of the permittivity away from vacuum , but there is never any reflection generated if we continue to change @xmath48 in such a way that it remains analytic in one half of the complex position plane . to see this , consider the formula for the second derivative of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath11 @xmath76\\label{d2s}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 from our analysis of @xmath78 we can see that , so long as @xmath79 is analytic and tends to zero in the upper half plane then @xmath80 will also have this property .",

    "this procedure can be used to iteratively show that all derivatives of @xmath6 have this property .",

    "this is because a soliton moves at a constant velocity without changing shape .",
    "therefore it s evolution is simultaneously governed by both the symmetries of sections  [ transsec ] and  [ kdvsec ] .",
    "but the reflection coefficient can not evolve according to both ( [ rtrans ] ) and ( [ rkdv ] ) except if it is zero for all @xmath52 .",
    "the same argument can also be carried out to derive complex permittivity profiles that have zero reflection coefficient from both sides , for all angles of incidence . if we demand that the solution to the kdv equation ( [ kdvequation ] ) translates in space at uniform velocity @xmath37 over ` time ' @xmath11 then the resulting profile will be reflectionless from both sides and have unit transmission , for all angles of incidence . substituting @xmath101",

    "although there has been quite a lot done to understand the properties of the complex kdv equation ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the complex solutions of this equation do not seem to have been widely examined for their properties as inhomogeneous optical media .",
    "in fact , with the freedom to choose @xmath91 , the velocity , and the two integration constants , ( [ complex_soliton ] ) defines a large number of reflectionless _ complex _ permittivity profiles that include the soliton profiles as a special case .",
    "the different profiles that are described by ( [ complex_soliton ] ) can be divided up into three kinds based on the coincidence of the roots in ( [ roots ] ) ; ( i ) @xmath107 , where the medium is complex and @xmath17 tends to the constant @xmath108 at infinity ; ( ii ) @xmath109 where the spatial extent of the profile depends on the argument of @xmath110 , e.g. it is an infinite periodic medium when @xmath111 , and confined to a finite region of space when @xmath112 ; and ( iii ) @xmath113 , which is a medium of infinite extent and may not be periodic .",
    "figure  [ invisible - fig ] shows instances of each of these cases , demonstrating the ultra low reflectivity of two confined profiles and the lack of any band gap ( as a function of angle ) for a periodic medium .",
    "a very peculiar feature of all of these profiles is that they retain their zero reflectivity and unit transmissivity as the angle of incidence is varied ( which amounts to varying the wavelength inside the medium ) , but _ not _ as the frequency is varied .",
    "this is exemplified in the final example of figure  [ invisible - fig ] where  at a fixed frequency ",
    "the ` cnoidal bragg mirror ' exhibits no band gap as a function of angle , while if the frequency is varied from the chosen value a band gap does in general appear .",

    "it is often practically useful to reduce the reflection of a wave for a range of angles as it passes from one medium to another , while keeping the length scale of the transition constant .",
    "here we use the above theory to suggest some ways of doing this .    as we have already shown , the reflection coefficient changes by an exponential factor under translation ( [ rtrans ] ) , or evolution by the kdv hierarchy ( [ rkdv ] ) .",

    "meanwhile for complex values of e.g. ` time ' @xmath11 , the reflection is exponentially increased or diminished .",
    "for example , simply translating ( [ initial - profile ] ) by an imaginary distance @xmath127 will change the reflection coefficient according to ( [ rtrans ] ) : @xmath128 .",
    "this alters the form of the profile around @xmath125 , continuously diminishing or amplifying the reflection until @xmath129 when one of the poles of the hyperbolic tangent is encountered , causing a jump in the reflectivity  @xcite . for this particular profile",
    "we can therefore diminish the reflection by at most a factor of @xmath130 through translation , which requires gain in the material parameters . despite this practical limitation , this method of translating the profile by an imaginary distance to modify the scattering properties is promising , and may be similarly applied to two and three dimensional inhomogeneous profiles .",

    "the crossover between these two cases occurs when @xmath137 , which is the smallest scale of transition where gain is not required in the material .",
    "this distributed loss must be implemented quite precisely in order to have the desired effect .",
    "there is a fascinating link between the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) equation of fluid dynamics and the time independent schrdinger equation : if the potential in the schrdinger equation is ` evolved ' subject to the kdv equation then the reflectivity as a function of energy remains unchanged for every snapshot in ` time ' . in the above work we have investigated the equivalent of this relationship for an electromagnetic wave propagating through an inhomogeneous slab of dielectric material , where the invariance of the reflectivity as a function of energy translates into invariance as a function of angle , for a fixed frequency .",
    "the relationship between the kdv equation and the reflectivity of an inhomogeneous slab was derived using an alternative method to the usual operator one , where we considered the radiation due to the current induced in the material when the permittivity is changed by a small amount . through demanding that this additional radiation change the field at @xmath1 in a way that depends only the field infinitesimally close to @xmath1 we derived the first two equations of the kdv hierarchy , as well as the kramers  kronig media recently considered in  @xcite .",
    "it may be that this provides an different physical picture of the link between the kdv hierarchy and wave propagation through inhomogeneous media .",
    "there is much more freedom to manipulate the reflectivity of a medium if the permittivity is allowed to take complex values . using an exact solution of the kdv equation ( a limiting case of which is the pschl  teller potential ) we found a very large class of both bounded and unbounded complex permittivity profiles that do not reflect from either side , for any angle of incidence , verifying this numerically . in the special case of the periodic ` cnoidal wave ' solution to the kdv equation we found that the non  reflection property translates into there being a real value of the bloch vector for all angles of propagation .",
    "finally we applied the evolution equations discussed in the first part of the paper to reduce the reflection of a wave from an interface , where the permittivity is rapidly increased from one constant value to another . in this case",
    "the kdv equation can be used to find a distribution of the dissipative response that must be added to the interface in order that the reflectivity is decreased for all angles of incidence ( although this reduction is much less for the angles far away from normal incidence ) .",
    "the overall purpose of this paper has been twofold : firstly to show that knowledge of the relationship between the kdv hierarchy and the helmholtz equation can be a useful addition to existing design tools such as transformation optics , and provides another method for controlling scattering from complex inhomogeneous media .",
    "the second purpose is to propose that metamaterials may be suitable for experimentally investigating the equivalence of scattering for media that have been ` evolved ' according to the kdv equation , a beautiful connection that has not yet been practically demonstrated .",

    "<S> there is a well explored relationship between quantum mechanical scattering from a potential and the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) equation of fluid dynamics : if the potential is ` evolved ' according to the kdv equation then it will have the same reflectivity and transmissivity as a function of energy , for each snapshot in time . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we explore this connection in optics , where the permittivity plays the role of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by deriving the relationship between the helmholtz equation and the kdv equation in terms of the current induced in a material when a permittivity profile is changed slightly . </S>",
    "<S> it is then shown that the kdv equation can be used to design a plethora of bounded complex potentials that are relfectionless from both sides for all angles of incidence , and planar periodic media that exhibit a real bloch vector for all angles of propagation . </S>",
    "<S> finally we apply the kdv equation to reduce the reflection of a wave from an interface between two media of differing refractive indices . </S>"
