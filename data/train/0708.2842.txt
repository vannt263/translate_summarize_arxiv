    "parametric decomposition of galaxy images has become a popular tool to estimate the structural parameters of different galactic components , particularly bulges and discs . through this sort of analysis , one is also able to determine the relative importance of the bulge component , with parameters such as the bulge - to - total luminosity ratio b / t , one of the major features that define the @xcite sequence .",
    "it thus provides indispensable means to investigate the formation and evolution of galaxies , and the origin of the hubble sequence , some of the key subjects in current astrophysical research .",
    "recently , the focus of studies using image decomposition shifted from relatively small samples of very nearby galaxies , where the fits can be done on a more careful , individual basis ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de jong 1995 ) ) , to include large samples of more distant galaxies , using automated procedures , that allow solid statistical analyses ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* allen  2006 ) ) .",
    "so far , most studies have ignored other components , such as bars ( but see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* laurikainen  2004 , 2005 ) ) , although the majority of disc galaxies host bars that usually contain a significant fraction of the galaxy total stellar mass .",
    "it is unclear how the parameters of bulge and disc are affected when bars are ignored .",
    "a similar issue concerns galaxies that host bright , type 1 agn : if the light contribution from the agn is not modelled , the structural parameters obtained might be incorrect .",
    "it is also not clear if the low physical spatial resolution usually found in images of more distant galaxies introduces any bias in the parameters recovered . to shed light on these issues , i performed multi - component image decomposition of a sample of very nearby galaxies and their artificially redshifted images , and verified the effects of removing the bar and agn components from the models .",
    "the results of these tests are shown in the next section [ the reader is referred to @xcite for full details on this work ] .",
    "the images used here are from @xcite . these are v and r images of 17 galaxies at @xmath1 , most of them hosting bars and agn .",
    "image decomposition is done using budda v2.1 ( see ( * ? ? ? * de souza , gadotti & dos anjos 2004 ) ) .",
    "all components are modelled as sets of concentric ellipses , with constant ellipticity and position angle .",
    "bulges are described with a srsic luminosity profile and discs are exponential .",
    "bars are described with boxy ellipses , also with a srsic profile , and the agn contribution is modelled using a circular moffat profile .",
    "when one takes advantage of the full capabilities of the code ( i.e. , all necessary components ) on these images , the results show a fairly good agreement with other studies .",
    "in addition , several known scaling relations are reproduced .",
    "0.3 cm     when one does not include the bar component in the models , the major effect is seen in the bulge models recovered : bulges get bigger , in a way to accommodate light from the bar . as a result",
    ", b / t is overestimated , on average , by 50% , but this overestimation can reach a factor of 2 .",
    "disc models are also systematically affected , but to a lesser extent : d / t is overestimated , on average , by 10% , with a maximum overestimation of 30% ( see fig . [ nobar ] ) .",
    "similar effects ( albeit restricted to the bulge component ) result when bright , type 1 agn are not considered in the models : b / t and the srsic index of the bulge @xmath2 can be overestimated by factors of 2 and 4 , respectively .    to verify if these results hold when the physical spatial resolution of the images is relatively low , i degraded the original images , thus artificially redshifting them to @xmath3 .",
    "the resolution in these images is 1.5 kpc , which is the typical resolution of sdss at this redshift .",
    "such a resolution is also typical in other works as well , and is what can be achieved at @xmath4 with hst . as with the original images ,",
    "the redshifted images were first used to perform a complete decomposition , and then to test the effects of removing the bar and agn components from the models .",
    "figure [ hz ] shows that , in general , structural parameters can be reliably retrieved through image fitting even in a low resolution regime .",
    "this is particularly true for the disc parameters .",
    "however , bulge parameters are prone to errors if its effective radius @xmath5 is small compared to the seeing radius , and b / t might suffer from systematic effects .",
    "b / t seems to be systematically overestimated , on average , by 0.05 , i.e. , 5% of the total galaxy luminosity , even when @xmath5 is similar to the seeing radius .",
    "when bars are excluded from the models to fit the redshifted images , one still sees similar effects as with the original images , namely , a significant overestimation of b / t and @xmath5 , if bars are prominent .",
    "the change in @xmath5 is even more pronounced in the redshifted images , likely because the geometrical properties of the bulge are substantially smoothed by the seeing , making it more difficult to constrain its properties . for less prominent bars",
    "these effects are reduced in strength .",
    "the effects caused by not taking into account bright agn , i.e. , the overestimation of b / t and @xmath2 , do _ not _ occur with the redshifted images , as the agn contribution is smeared out by the seeing .",
    "when bars are not taken into account , the amount of mass in stars in bulges and discs is overestimated , and the excess is an indication of the amount of mass in stars that reside in bars .",
    "@xcite estimated the @xmath6 stellar mass content in classical bulges and discs through image decomposition of @xmath7 galaxies , with a spatial resolution similar to that of the redshifted images above .",
    "bars are not taken into account in the fitted models , but these authors made a thorough quality control , removing poor fits .",
    "however , it is usually the case that , even when there is no bar in the model , when fitting a barred galaxy , one gets an acceptable ( though wrong ) fit , essentially because the bulge model is distorted . hence , with reasonable assumptions , one can use their results to obtain a _ rough _ estimate of what can be the stellar content in bars , assuming that the biases produced in a low resolution regime and by ignoring bars , as found above , can be used in this case to obtain the true bulge and disc luminosity fractions",
    "thus , the stellar content in classical bulges and discs is found to be @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . and",
    "the stellar content in bars is @xmath10 .",
    "although these are rough estimates , that need to be confirmed by further studies , they open up the possibility of bars being as important as bulges in what concerns their stellar mass content in the local universe .",
    "are disc galaxies ) from the sdss .",
    "bulges show a remarkably different distribution as compared to ellipticals , with the family of pseudo - bulges ( i.e. , those with srsic index less than about 2 ) standing out clearly.,width=340 ]    figure [ ndistr ] shows the distribution of the srsic index of bulges and ellipticals in a sample of about 200 disc galaxies and 100 ellipticals from the sdss , obtained using budda v2.1 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gadotti & kauffmann 2007 ) ) .",
    "one clearly sees the dichotomy between classical bulges , with @xmath11 , and pseudo - bulges , with @xmath12 .",
    "this figure indicates that the fraction of pseudo - bulges at @xmath6 is @xmath13 .",
    "i would like to thank martin bureau and the organisers for this very fruitful meeting .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank guinevere kauffmann for her active role in this work , with insightful comments and suggestions , and ronaldo de souza , for his help in the making of the new budda version .",
