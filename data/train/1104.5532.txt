    "eventually , both will resemble a random graph , with the average distance , betweenness centrality , efficiency , radius , diameter and resistance being close to the statistical average .",
    "the question though is how fast this state is reached .",
    "if the change is very fast , this means that a few changes in the structure are able to negate the advantages that an extremal graph is able to provide . however , if a particular property does not change much after several rewirings , we can afford to build networks with many other desirable properties without the need to follow exactly the specific architecture for every given property .",
    "we have tested the change of average distance , radius , diameter and resistance for networks of small order . refering to figure [ statisticalanalysis ] ,",
    "we find that the average distance of networks with large average shortest path length decreases very quickly after a few rewirings . convergence to the statistical average is much slower for networks that start with the smallest average distance .",
    "the number of rewirings required to get close to the statistical average is an increasing function of the order of the network when the edge density is constant , as one would expect , since there are more edges that need to be rewired in order to make a difference .",
    "the same general conclusions can be drawn for the evolution of the network radius , diameter and resistance .",
    "the general conclusion is that networks with the smallest average distance , radius and diameter and resistance are much more robust to changes in their architecture because they rely on a global pattern of interconnections , and each edge has a small role in ensuring that property , so its conservation is diffused among many edges . on the contrary ,",
    "networks with maximum distance , radius , diameter and resistance are very sensitive to change , because most vertex connections are prohibited , in the sense that if currently non - neighboring vertices are connected , there is a dramatic change towards the statistical average ."
