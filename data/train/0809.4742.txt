    "it is exactly 100 years this year since the publication of the first evidence of nuclear activity in galaxies @xcite . over the last half century or so , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have been the subject of increasingly intensive study which has resulted in tens of thousands of papers being published . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed that the huge energy release lasting for millions of years from a typical agn could be explained by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole . in such accretion ,",
    "the energy output efficiency may reach 43% of the accreting matter s rest mass energy .",
    "this gave the first estimates of lower limits to the masses of agns because the luminosity , @xmath4 , can not go much above the eddington limit , @xmath5 erg / s , so the mass of the black hole in an agn has to be of the order of several million to several billion solar masses , depending on the luminosity of the agn @xcite .",
    "while the eddington limit gives a lower limit to the mass , @xmath6 , of the black hole , the actual mass could be orders of magnitude greater than this . to understand the working of agns",
    ", @xmath6 needs to be determined observationally , so estimating @xmath6 has always been considered to be a matter of utmost importance in agn studies .",
    "if the motions of gas clouds are dominated by gravity , masses can be estimated in principle from the virial theorem if we know a velocity and an appropriate distance from the center ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity along the line of sight can easily be determined from the doppler broadening of emission lines , but determining the distance of the emitting material from the central object is difficult .",
    "it was not until the work of @xcite that an attempt was made at a consistent spectroscopic determination of the masses of the central objects for a large sample of agns .",
    "this enabled dibai to determine black hole masses and eddington ratios , @xmath7 , for dozens of agns for the first time @xcite , and to begin investigations in what promised to be ( and indeed has turned out to be ) a very fruitful area : the relationships between these quantities and other agn parameters ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) . unfortunately , this work was cut short by dibai s premature death , and in the two decades after his 1977 paper there were only a few papers by others using the dibai method to estimate black hole masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the last decade , however , there has been an enormous growth of interest in determining masses by dibai s method because of the close relationship between the masses of black holes and the masses of the bulges of their host galaxies ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is only through the dibai method that large numbers of black hole masses in agns can currently be determined , and the method has already been used in making tens of thousands of mass estimates for agns of all redshifts in the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to revisit the original dibai mass estimates and see how they compare with more recent independent estimates .",
    "@xcite showed that the emitting regions of the broad and narrow components of agn optical emission lines ( what we now call the blr and nlr respectively ) had to originate in different locations in space , and that the emitting gas , in both cases , had to have a cloudy structure , that is , to fill only a small fraction , @xmath8 , of the volume of the corresponding region .",
    "it has long been recognized ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) that blr variability timescales could be used to estimate the effective distance of the emitting gas from the black hole , and hence to get masses via the virial theorem .",
    "@xcite presented the first long - term h@xmath9 light curve for an agn . @xcite and @xcite made narrow - band observations of three agns over several months and published the first actual estimates of blr sizes from the time lag between continuum variability and line variability .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite independently developed methods for recovering information about the blr from the response of the lines to continuum variations , a subject which has now become known as `` reverberation mapping '' .",
    "determining blr sizes became practical and widespread with the introduction of cross - correlation techniques @xcite a few years later .",
    "once blr radii were being reliably obtained from cross - correlation studies , the main remaining problem in estimating masses was in establishing that the gas motions were dominated by gravity .",
    "the dominant belief from the early days of agn studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) was that emission - line gas was outflowing from agns , and the virial theorem obviously can not be applied to an outflowing wind .",
    "the idea of determining blr kinematics diagnostics by line - profile variations was first brought forward by s.  n. @xcite , then dibai s graduate student .",
    "the first velocity - resolved reverberation mapping ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) showed that the blr was not outflowing , but instead showing some net inflow in combination with keplerian and/or chaotic motion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this discovery immediately permitted the first reverberation - mapping determinations of black hole masses @xcite .    despite the promising results of the pioneering observations of @xcite and @xcite , it was emphasized by @xcite , confirming earlier calculations of @xcite and @xcite , that reliable results could only be obtained from of long time - sequences of well - sampled , high - accuracy , spectral and photometric observational data obtained through a large - scale international project .",
    "the urgent need for starting such collaborations was discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the following decades saw the progress of the _ international agn watch _ ( _ iaw _ ) program ( see @xcite , et seq . )",
    "aimed at determining the blr size and structure from reverberation mapping .",
    "that project proved to be one of the largest global astronomical monitoring programs to date .",
    "more than 200 astronomers from 35 countries cooperated for 15 years in accumulating long , densely - sampled , uv , optical , and other wavelength time series for many agn . as a result of this , and of additional optical monitoring campaigns , reverberation - mapping estimates of the agn central black hole mass have now been obtained for over 40 agns ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we make a comparison of agn central object mass values from reverberation mapping campaigns with the masses obtained by dibai over a quarter of a century ago . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the assumptions made by dibai . in section 3",
    "we compare the results yielded by the two methods .",
    "section 4 discusses the implications of the comparison .",
    "in his first ( 1977 ) paper dibai explained the basic principles of his method for estimating the masses of the black holes in agns and gave masses for 15 agns . in 1980 and 1981 further masses for many more agns were published @xcite .",
    "he then composed a catalogue of the main characteristics of 77 seyfert 1 nearby galaxies and nearby quasars and of 24 seyfert 2 galaxies , and used it as the basis for new agn mass and accretion rate estimates .",
    "what were to be the final results were published in @xcite , which did not appear until after the author s untimely death occurred in november of 1983 .",
    "dibai estimated the mass of the central region of agns under the assumption that the gas clouds responsible for broad emission line formation were moving with more or less parabolic velocities in the gravitational - field of the black hole so that @xmath10 here @xmath6 is the mass of the central object ( presumably a black hole ) , @xmath11 is the blr radius , @xmath12 is the gas velocity ( which dibai determined from the fwhm of the broad component of h@xmath9 ) , and @xmath13 is the gravitational constant .    to estimate the size of region producing the broad component of h@xmath9 dibai used the simple relationship : @xmath14",
    "where @xmath8 is the blr gas filling factor ; that is , the fraction of the blr volume filed with the emitting gas .",
    "it should be noted that since @xmath15 over many orders of magnitude @xcite , eq(2 ) means that @xmath16    dibai estimated the volume occupied by the emitting gas by assuming that the h@xmath9 line is optically thin and emitted in the low - density approximation ( the so - called `` coronal approximation '' ) ; that is , that the results obtained for classical ionized hydrogen zones may be applied to the line .    on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath17 is the luminosity in the h@xmath9 line and @xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 is emissivity for h  ii zones heated up to @xmath21 k with electron number density , @xmath22 @xmath19 .",
    "dibai based his estimate of the density on two things .",
    "firstly , the absence of broad components of forbidden spectral lines in agn spectra leads to a lower limit of @xmath23 @xmath19 . secondly , the presence of the semi - forbidden ciii ] @xmath241909 line implies an upper limit of @xmath25 @xmath19 . for the filling factor parameter ,",
    "@xmath8 , dibai adopted a value obtained for the fraction of the volume of the emitting gas in the crab nebula , @xmath26 . with these assumptions",
    "dibai then estimated @xmath6 for almost 80 type-1 seyfert galaxies and nearby quasars .",

    "the masses range from @xmath27 up to @xmath28 .",

    "1 , there is obviously a good correlation .",

    "the systematic difference in the logarithms of the masses determined by the two methods is @xmath32 the systematic difference between the two methods is therefore only 40% .",
    "the scatter in the ratio of masses determined by the two methods is @xmath33 dex , but at least some of this must be due to the errors in the reverberation - mapping estimates .",
    "the mean of the formal reverberation mass measurement errors quoted by @xcite and @xcite is @xmath34 dex . if we make the ( unlikely ) assumption that these measurement errors are the only source of error in the reverberation mass estimates , then the average error in the dibai estimates is @xmath35 dex .",
    "however , this is an approximate upper limit to the errors in the dibai method because there are other ( unknown ) errors in the reverberation mapping mass determinations .",
    "if we assume that the errors are equally distributed between the dibai method and the reverberation - mapping method , then the mean of the errors in the dibai method of black hole mass estimation is @xmath36 dex .",
    "@xcite have made a detailed examination of the effects of random and systematic observational errors on masses estimated by the dibai method .",
    "they find that with careful treatment of line profiles using high - quality spectra ( signal - to - noise ratio @xmath37 20:1 ) it is possible to get errors of @xmath38 dex in the mass if the observational uncertainties are the only source of error . since dibai did not have the advantage of modern digital spectra , the contribution of observational errors to his mass estimates must have been significantly greater than @xmath34 dex .",
    "our comparison thus tells us that under ideal circumstances , the _ intrinsic _ accuracy of the dibai method is potentially quite high .",
    "the surprising agreement of the estimated mass values implies that all the `` classical '' type-1 agns ( seyfert 1 galaxies and nearby quasars ) are very much alike in their properties and structure , and that object - to - object differences are smaller than has been hitherto thought .",
    "the agreement of the dibai and reverberation mapping results provides support for the following :    \\1 .",
    "blr gas motions are dominated by gravity , as has been shown by velocity - resolved reverberation mapping ( @xcite , etc . ) , and as is also strongly supported by the inverse correlation of line widths with the sizes of the emitting regions of different ions , and hence the consistency of mass estimates from these different ions ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus the emission comes predominantly from gravitationally - bound gas , and not gas flowing away from the nucleus .",
    "this is an assumption in common to both the dibai and reverberation mapping methods .",
    "dibai recognized from the outset @xcite that it had not yet been established that the motions were dominated by gravity .",
    "he also noted that outflow velocities in wolf - rayet stars only slightly exceed the escape velocity , so his mass estimates could also apply if the blr was a radiatively - driven outflow .",
    "the blr size scales with optical luminosity as @xmath39 .",
    "this is supported by reverberation mapping estimates of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "dibai took @xmath40 to be @xmath41 ( see eqs . 2 and 3 ) while @xcite get @xmath42 .",
    "while the slope of the line in fig .",
    "1 ( @xmath43 ) is already consistent with unity , if we adopt @xmath40 = 1/2 , rather than the @xmath40 = 1/3 dibai with @xmath44 ( see eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) , this changes the slope of the line to 0.97 .",
    "the `` warm '' gas has a similar filling factor , @xmath45 for all the type-1 agns .",
    "this means that the space between blr clouds is about 10 times bigger than the mean cloud size .",
    "since the blr is probably flattened ( see @xcite ) , the average separation between the clouds will be a little smaller .",
    "slow temperature variations of the `` warm '' ( @xmath46 k ) blr gas discussed recently by @xcite do not make significant deviations of the average value ) of blr gas emissivity @xmath47 in h@xmath9 line for the 17 agns considered here from the quantity @xmath48 erg @xmath19 s@xmath20 adopted by dibai ( 1984b ) .",
    "the possible presence of other blr emission components , such as a blr component near the jet in radio - loud agn ( see @xcite , and @xcite ) in addition to the `` standard '' blr associated with the accretion disk does not noticeably affect the average value of the porosity , @xmath8 , of the gas responsible for the blr .",
    "the contribution of non - standard blr components to the total blr emission is thus probably small , at least for the typical blrs of the 17 agns considered here .",
    "the first two of these assumptions are common to both the dibai method and reverberation mapping , and these two assumptions tell us things about blr gas flow in agns .",
    "the next two assumptions are unique to the dibai method and , in combination with the good agreement of mass estimations we have found , they tell us additional significant things about agns .",
    "the third assumption is that the physical conditions in the blr clouds are similar ( i.e. , similar densities and ionization parameters ) , and the fourth is that the seds are similar .",
    "the fifth assumption was only used to get the scale factor or zero point in the original dibai method .",
    "the large number of more recent applications of the dibai method scale the radii to reverberation mapping radii instead .",
    "nonetheless , the agreement we find between dibai s mass scale and that of reverberation mapping implies that dibai s assumption of a filling factor of @xmath49 is a good one .",
    "the agreement arises , of course , because of the agreement in estimated radii .",
    "dibai indeed noted at the outset @xcite that the estimated radii agreed with the reverberation mapping results of @xcite .",
    "taken together , the apparent correctness of the main assumptions of dibai s method reinforces the idea that , despite the wide range of masses of their black holes and the wide range of accretion rates , a large fraction of type-1 agns are surprisingly similar .",
    "this is an important result which needs to be understood and which requires further study .",
    "the final , obvious , and important conclusion that can be drawn from the good agreement we find between masses estimated by the single - epoch spectrum method pioneered by @xcite and by the reverberation mapping method ( and also the agreement that @xcite and @xcite find between their own single - epoch estimate and reverberation mapping ) is that the dibai method _ does _ give reliable black hole mass estimates .",
    "this is very important for studying cosmic evolution of black holes and host galaxies because it shows that the long - term , labour - intensive monitoring of reverberation mapping is not necessary to obtain the mass of every single agns in the sample .",
    "the reliability of the dibai method makes investigations of cosmic agn evolution , black hole growth , and the links with the properties and evolution of host galaxies considerably easier .",
    "the simple comparison we have presented here implies that we can indeed trust this method which has now been used already for obtaining mass estimates of many tens of thousands of agns .",
    "the success of the dibai method certainly does not mean that there is no need for further reverberation mapping studies .",
    "reverberation mapping is needed for testing the reliability of black hole mass determinations for agns of extreme types which are not represented in table 1 .",
    "for example : high eddington ratio agns ( so called `` narrow - line seyfert 1s '' ) and very low eddington ratio agns ( such as fr1 radio galaxies ) , which might have non - classical blrs , are not represented .",
    "the good agreement of the dibai method with reverberation mapping for the 17 agns considered here does not reduce the importance of the reverberation mapping in general .",
    "the two methods are complimentary and not mutually replaceable .    this work has been supported by the russian foundation for basic research ( rfbr ) through grant 06 - 02 - 16843 , and by the us national science foundation ( nsf ) through grants ast 03 - 07912 and ast 08 - 03883 .",
