    "it has long been speculated that zero metallicity , population iii stars exist , but as yet none of these stars have been identified . at the current epoch",
    "low mass stars are the most numerous stars in the galaxy , however the first stars are often thought to have formed with exclusively high masses . for example @xcite estimated the minimum mass of a population iii star to be a massive 1500 m@xmath3 , more recently @xcite estimated the minimum mass to be 50 m@xmath3 . on the other hand @xcite",
    "proposed a method by which stars of mass as low as 0.2 m@xmath3   could be formed from primordial material .",
    "recently using hydrodynamical simulations @xcite suggested a bi - modal population iii initial mass function with a minimum mass of between 1 and 2 m@xmath3 .",
    "the discovery of the extremely metal deficient star he0107 - 5240 @xcite which has an estimated mass of 0.8 m@xmath3   and [ fe / h]=-5.3 has added credence to the possibility that low mass primordial stars formed . all population iii stars with mass less than about 0.75 m@xmath3   should still be on the main sequence and thus could , if ever observed , provide an estimate of the age of the universe .",
    "the accuracy of stellar formation and evolution calculations is , among other things , dependent upon available opacity data . in the absence of metals",
    "the only contributors to the opacity of the atmospheres population iii stars are the various hydrogen and helium species and ions , and electrons . in a zero metallicity gas at densities common to stellar atmospheres it is h@xmath5 that dominates opacity at temperatures between about 3500 k and 7000 k. below about 3500 k it is collision induced absorption ( cia ) by h@xmath6-he and h@xmath6-h@xmath6 that dominates the opacity .",
    "many authors @xcite have commented upon how h@xmath0 can act as an electron donor in low metallicity stars , thereby increasing the abundance of h@xmath5 and hence the opacity .",
    "however none have yet investigated the effect of h@xmath0   rotation - vibration line absorption on a hydrogen - helium gas opacity .",
    "the zero metallicity opacity calculations of @xcite used the h@xmath0   partition function of @xcite , whereas the opacity calculations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite used the partition functions of @xcite .",
    "the partition functions of @xcite and @xcite are an order of magnitude smaller at t@xmath44000 k , than the latest most accurate h@xmath0   partition function of @xcite .",
    "the @xcite h@xmath0   partition function was computed by direct summation of 200  000 rotation - vibration energy levels .",
    "this most recent h@xmath0   partition function has been used extensively in the modeling of cool stellar , white and brown dwarf atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the cool stellar and brown dwarf atmospheres of @xcite have subsequently been incorporated in evolution models of brown dwarfs and low mass stars by @xcite and @xcite . in particular",
    "@xcite studied very low mass , low metallicity stars of [ m / h]@xmath72.0 and @xcite studied zero metallicity very low mass stars with the @xcite partition function .",
    "however neither the h@xmath0   partition function of @xcite or any h@xmath0   linelist has been used in evolution calculations of low mass , zero or very low metallicity stars .",
    "recent very low and zero metallicity low mass stellar evolution calculations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite use the low temperature ( t@xmath8 k ) @xcite opacities .",
    "whereas @xcite use low temperature opacities based on kurucz data , see @xcite and @xcite . the minimum mass to which these very low metallicity evolution calculations extend down to is 0.5 m@xmath3 .",
    "as we show below , zero metallicity stars of mass less than about 0.5 m@xmath3   are affected by h@xmath0   acting as an electron donor .",
    "in this paper we present new low temperature rosseland mean opacities for a zero metallicity gas in lte .",
    "these opacities have been calculated both with and without the @xcite partition function and the @xcite h@xmath0   linelist .",
    "we then incorporate these new opacity data within the cesam stellar evolution code @xcite and examine the effect of h@xmath0   on the pre - main and main sequence evolution of zero metallicity stars .",
    "for compatibility with the cesam stellar evolution code @xcite , the rosseland mean opacity must be determined from the state variables temperature ( t ) , mass density ( @xmath9 ) and hydrogen mass fraction ( x ) .",
    "the opacity of a gas is dependent upon its chemical composition , so the abundances of all the species within the gas or plasma must first be determined . for this purpose thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium",
    "are assumed , which for low densities allows the uses of the saha equation to determine the number densities of individual species . by combining these number densities with the cross sections of the relevant scattering or absorption process",
    "we can obtain the total opacity for the process in the gas .",
    "rosseland mean opacities are then computed as below .      the species that are considered in this work are listed in table [ tab : partfunc ] together with the source of the rotational - vibrational partition function if relevant .",
    "we use an iterative approach to solve for chemical equilibrium using the saha equations for each chemical species .    for the initial conditions of our calculation a neutral h@xmath6 and he gas",
    "is used , the number densities of all other species are set to zero .",
    "the initial number densities of h@xmath6 and he are determined from temperature , @xmath9 and x. for most of the values of t and @xmath9 considered in this work h@xmath6 , h or he are the most abundant species .",
    "so we first determine the dominant hydrogen species by calculating a first order number density of h from h@xmath6 using the saha equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number density of the species @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the total partition function of species @xmath12 , and @xmath14 is the dissociation energy of h@xmath6 . the total partition function , @xmath13 , which for h@xmath6 is the product of translational , rotational - vibrational and electronic partition functions . in this work",
    "we neglect electronic states higher than the ground state and set the electronic partition function equal to the degeneracy of the ground electronic state .",
    "equation [ eq : h2h ] is solved iteratively using a newton - raphson technique and forcing the conservation of h nuclei .",
    "using the saha ionization equation we then determine the first order number densities of h@xmath15 , h@xmath5 , he@xmath15 , h@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , heh@xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "again an iterative newton - raphson technique is employed , taking care to conserve charge and hydrogen and helium nuclei .",
    "the determination of the number density of h@xmath0   is slightly more difficult .",
    "the usual formation reaction of h@xmath0   in the interstellar medium is : @xmath19 see for example @xcite . in chemical equilibrium",
    "the number density of h@xmath16 is often many orders of magnitude smaller than that of h@xmath0 which in turn is many orders of magnitude smaller than the number densities of h@xmath6 and h. this can result in problems with machine accuracy .",
    "instead we estimate the number density of h@xmath0   from h@xmath6 or h , depending upon whether h@xmath6 or h is more abundant .",
    "for instance if h@xmath6 is dominant then we use the hypothetical reaction : @xmath20 .",
    "this reaction has the saha equation : @xmath21 ^ 2}{q_t({\\rm h_3^+})q_t({\\rm h } ) q_t(e^-)}\\exp \\left(\\frac{\\chi}{kt}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the difference in energy between products and reactants , this is equal to the dissociation energy of h@xmath6 ( 4.52 ev ) plus the ionization potential of h ( 13.60 ev ) minus the proton affinity of h@xmath6 ( 4.38 ev ) , so @xmath22=13.74 ev .",
    "this approach increases the stability of the calculation of the number density of h@xmath0 .",
    "it is valid because , by definition , in chemical equilibrium each species is in equilibrium with every other species .    once the first estimate for the number density of h@xmath0   has been obtained , the process is reiterated , using the new number densities , until converged values for the number density of each species are obtained .",
    "figure [ fig : n_vs_t_all ] shows an illustration of the temperature dependences of the number densities of each species at @xmath23 g @xmath24   and x=0.72 . importantly at @xmath23 g",
    "@xmath24   h@xmath0   is the dominant positive ion below 3500 k , so will have a strong effect on the abundances of ions and electrons below this temperature . figure [ fig : n_vs_ro_all ]",
    "shows an illustration of the mass density dependences of the number densities of each species at t=3500 and x=0.72 . here",
    "h@xmath0   becomes the dominant ion above @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : n_vs_t_h3p ] shows the number density of h@xmath5 and h@xmath0   calculated using the h@xmath0   rotational - vibrational partition functions of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite as a function of temperature with @xmath23 and x=0.72 .",
    "clearly the number densities of h@xmath0   and h@xmath5 are strongly dependent upon which partition function is used , indeed above 4000 k use of the @xcite partition function yields an order of magnitude more h@xmath0   than the use of other partition functions . however at this mass density h@xmath15 becomes the dominant ion above 3700 k and the effect of h@xmath0   on h@xmath5 quickly diminishes with increasing temperature . as h@xmath5 is an important source of opacity ,",
    "the opacity is sensitive to which partition function is used in the calculation .",
    "the limits of the partition functions used in this work effectively determine the temperature limits for which this equation of state is reliable .",
    "for all but h@xmath0   the partition functions extend up to at least 9000 k , and down to 1000 k. for h@xmath0   the @xcite partition function extends to 8000 k. at the densities of interest to us h@xmath0   is relatively unimportant between 8000 and 9000 k. therefore our equation of state is reliable between 1000 to 9000 k. the main short coming of the saha equation is that it does not account for pressure ionization which occurs at very high densities .",
    "this imposes an upper density limit above which our equation of state is not valid .",
    "@xcite show that for t less than 10  000 k , the upper density for which the saha equation is valid is around @xmath26 , we take this as the upper density limit for our equation of state .",
    "is readily destroyed in a dissociative recombination reaction with electrons .",
    "hence high abundances of electrons act to reduce the abundance of h@xmath0 .",
    "many species of metals have an ionization energy that is significantly lower than that of hydrogen , so that , in a gas containing metals , it is the metals that govern the abundance of free electrons . in this way",
    "metals have a strong effect on the abundance of h@xmath0 .",
    "as all known stars contain some metals we briefly investigate the effect that these metals have upon h@xmath0 .",
    "the equation of state is dependent upon the relative abundance of each metal . as the stars in which h@xmath0   is an important electron donor are likely to be metal poor we use the metal abundance mix found in the very metal poor star he0107 - 5240 , discovered by @xcite . where the abundances of these metals are unmeasured for he0107 - 5240 we use the metal abundances based upon a theoretical population iii supernova yield calculated by @xcite .",
    "in our equation of state we include what are likely to be the ten most abundant metals in he0107 - 5240 : c , n , o , ne , na , mg , si , s , ca and fe .",
    "we included the first ionization states , and the anions of the metals within our equation of state .",
    "figure [ fig : metals1 ] shows the number densities of h@xmath0 , h@xmath15 , e@xmath5 and the positive metal ions ( z@xmath15 ) as function of temperature , at a density of 10@xmath27 g @xmath24 . from this figure ,",
    "h@xmath0   is the dominant positive ion in a gas between temperatures of 3000 and 3600 k with a elemental abundances similar to he0107 - 5240 .",
    "figure [ fig : metals2 ] shows the number densities of h@xmath0 , h@xmath15 , e@xmath5 and the positive metal ions ( z@xmath15 ) , as function of metal mass fraction .",
    "we have used the same metal mix as for figure [ fig : metals1 ] with a constant hydrogen mass fraction of x@xmath280.72 and a density of 10@xmath27 g @xmath24 .",
    "the total number density of the positive metal ions only exceeds the number density of h@xmath0   for metal mass fractions above @xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted that the metal mix found in he0107 - 5240 has a very high carbon to iron ratio relative to solar ( [ c@xmath30fe]@xmath31 ) , but has a comparatively low abundance of more readily ionized elements such as na ( [ na@xmath30fe]@xmath32 ) and fe .",
    "hence this metal mix will result in fewer free electrons at low temperatures than a solar metal mix . for a solar metal mix @xcite with the same temperature and density , we find that the metals are the main electron donors for metal mass fractions above about 10@xmath27 .",
    "the relative importance of h@xmath0   as an electron donor is not only dependent upon metallicity , but also the relative abundances of the metals within the mix .",
    "density also has a role in determining the dominant positive ion , high densities favor h@xmath0   low densities favor the metal ions .",
    "hence h@xmath0   is more likely to have an effect on very metal poor low mass dwarf stars rather than low mass giants .",
    "the frequency dependent continuous opacity can now be calculated using the number densities of the various species . in this work",
    "the set of subroutines developed by @xcite were used to calculate the continuous opacity contributions from h  i , h@xmath5 , he@xmath5 , he  i , he  ii bound - free and free - free , h@xmath17 free - free , rayleigh scattering of he  i , h@xmath6 and h  i and thompson scattering by e@xmath5 .",
    "we have also included the @xcite h@xmath16 free - free and bound - free opacity data .",
    "the method used by @xcite for each absorption or scattering process is summarized in table [ tab : opasour ] along with all the other opacity sources .",
    "we have not included any photodissociation processes for heh@xmath15 as these are considered unimportant or important only at extreme ultra violet wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we have also included h  i line absorption by using the stark subroutine from the atlas12 @xcite program .",
    "h  i line absorption is important for temperatures greater than @xmath47500 k.    in this work we make use of the most recent cia data , which are in a tabular form .",
    "we use the h@xmath6-he cia data of @xcite , which covers the temperature range 1000 to 7000 k and the wavenumber range 25 to 20  000 @xmath33 .",
    "the h@xmath6-h@xmath6 data of @xcite which covers the temperature range 1000 to 7000 k and the wavenumber range 20 to 20  000 @xmath33 .",
    "the h - he data of @xcite which covers the temperature range 1500 to 10  000 k and the wavenumber range 50 to 11  000 @xmath33 .",
    "no cia data for h - he collisions were available to @xcite and @xcite , but these data have been used by @xcite in the calculation of synthetic white dwarf spectra .",
    "our calculations indicate that at low hydrogen mass fractions and @xmath34 and @xmath35 h - he cia contributes significantly to the rosseland mean opacity and is the dominant source of continuous opacity between wavelengths of @xmath43.3 to @xmath413 @xmath36 m .",
    "we have neglected h - h@xmath6 cia , however , since it has only a small effect on opacity in a narrow temperature range when h@xmath6 and h are of near equal abundances . at low hydrogen mass fractions ,",
    "low temperatures and moderate to high densities he - he cia may have an effect on opacity .",
    "we have not found any he - he opacity data , so have not been able to include this source of opacity in our calculations .    for the purposes of our calculation the cia opacity tables of @xcite",
    "are interpolated using a bicubic spline .",
    "frequencies at which cia is an important source of opacities are covered by the frequency ranges of the data tables . beyond the upper temperature limit of the cia data",
    "tables many opacity sources exceed , by several orders of magnitude , the opacity from cia .",
    "however cia from h@xmath6-he and h@xmath6-h@xmath6 collisions remains important for some temperatures below 1000 k. so the calculation of the total opacity is limited only by the lower temperature limits of the h@xmath6-he and h@xmath6-h@xmath6 cia data tables , which is 1000 k.    to investigate the effect of direct absorption by h@xmath0   the _ ab initio _",
    "rotational - vibrational linelist of @xcite was used .",
    "this linelist contains over 3@xmath37 lines between 0 and 15  000 @xmath33   all of which were used .",
    "a thermal doppler line profile was used to distribute the intensity of each line , this approximation to the true line profile is valid as all the h@xmath0   lines are weak such that the extended line wings contribute little to the overall opacity .",
    "h@xmath0   was found to contribute up to 15% of the rosseland mean opacity via line absorption .",
    "this is far smaller than the indirect effect h@xmath0   has on opacity through electron donation , which can increase the rosseland mean opacity by over a factor of 3 .",
    "however it implies that h@xmath0   lines may well be observable in cool population iii stellar spectra .",
    "we have identified a mistake in figures 1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "an incorrect degeneracy factor of 2 instead of 8/3 was used to calculate the absorption by hotter lines in these figures , which resulted in the quoted absorption and emission being reduced by up to 25% .",
    "the mistake affects only figures 1 and 2 and has no bearing on the einstein a coefficents of the @xcite linelist .",
    "the ion heh@xmath15 has a strong electric dipole moment and so will have a strong infrared spectrum .",
    "we have not been able to find an extensive set of heh@xmath15 line intensities , so we can not include heh@xmath15 line absorption into our opacity calculation .",
    "the line opacity of h@xmath0   only contributes significantly to the rosseland mean opacity when the opacity of the gas is low and the number density of h@xmath0   is high .",
    "the number densities of heh@xmath15 exceed h@xmath0   only at high temperatures , when the rosseland mean opacity is high .",
    "we would expect the total line absorption intensities of heh@xmath15 per molecule to be weaker than that of h@xmath0 .",
    "so we believe that heh@xmath15 will have little effect on the opacity , but this needs to be verified .",
    "figure [ fig : mono ] shows the frequency dependent opacity of the dominant contributors to the total continuous opacity at t=3500 k , @xmath23 g @xmath24 and x=0.72 .",
    "the total opacity is calculated by summing all the contributors to the opacity .",
    "this figure illustrates the strength of cia , h@xmath5 and h@xmath0   line absorption , hence the importance that these sources of opacity are correctly accounted for .",
    "the h@xmath0   line absorption has a clear effect on the frequency dependent opacity between 1500 and 8000 @xmath33 .",
    "this indicates that line absorption may well be observable in certain cool dense metal free stars , brown and possibly cool white dwarfs .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity is defined by : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the planck function , @xmath40 is the rosseland mean opacity and @xmath41 is the monochromatic opacity .",
    "the denominator is evaluated analytically , but the numerator must be evaluated numerically .",
    "we use 30  000 integration points , which is sufficient to account for h@xmath0   line absorption and to converge the integration .",
    "the partition functions we have used to calculate the number densities of the various species limit us to temperatures above 1000 k. we therefore only give opacity data for temperatures above 1000 k. this minimum temperature is sufficient for our stellar models .    figure [ fig : ross_prev ] show the rosseland mean opacity calculated in this work along with those of @xcite and @xcite at @xmath42 and x=0.72 .",
    "the @xcite data were interpolated using a bi - cubic spline .",
    "a density of @xmath42 is too low for the effect of h@xmath0   on the number density of h@xmath5 to be evident .",
    "however at this density h@xmath0   line opacity is strong enough to contribute 13 % of the rosseland mean opacity at 3250 k. the rosseland mean opacity of this work for t@xmath43 k is significantly higher than those of @xcite and @xcite . at these temperatures",
    "the opacity is dominated by cia and a little h@xmath0   line opacity .",
    "the older works of @xcite and @xcite do not include h@xmath0   line opacity and use older cia data which is weaker than the more recent cia data , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "so a greater opacity at these temperatures is to be expected .",
    "figure [ fig : ross_q ] shows a plot of the roseland mean opacity at @xmath44 g @xmath24   and x=0.72 . the opacities were calculated with the h@xmath0   partition functions of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and also without accounting for h@xmath0 .",
    "the rosseland mean opacity of @xcite is also plotted , but that of @xcite does not extend to these high densities .",
    "again the difference between the opacity of @xcite and this work are evident , at these temperatures collision induced absorption is important for t@xmath45 k and accounts for part of the difference .",
    "line absorption is weak making up @xmath41.1% of the rosseland mean opacity at 4000 k. but the most important factor is clearly attributable to the effect of h@xmath0   on the opacity .",
    "the partition functions of @xcite and @xcite lead to an under prediction of the abundance of h@xmath5 and hence the opacity .",
    "it would appear that h@xmath0   has an effect on the opacity several times stronger , and to about 500 k hotter , than predicted by the partition functions of @xcite and @xcite . at higher densities still , these differences are even larger and h@xmath0   electron donation becomes even more important .",
    "the contribution of h@xmath0   line absorption to the rosseland mean opacity peaks at about @xmath46 and t=3125 k , at which it is 15 % of the opacity .",
    "we give rosseland mean opacities for a range of densities , temperatures and hydrogen mass fractions in table [ tab : ross_opa ] .",
    "we use the 1d cesam stellar evolution code @xcite for our calculations .",
    "the cesam code has been widely applied to helio- and asteroseismology , but has also been used for studies low mass stars ( 0.6 m@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the basic input physics is identical to that described by @xcite , except for the nuclear reaction rates , opacities and equations of state , which are as follows .",
    "we use the recent nacre @xcite compilation of nuclear reaction rates , which had been previously incorporated into the cesam code and used for solar evolution models @xcite .",
    "the recently improved and extended opal equation of state @xcite which we refer to as opal02 is used for all temperatures and densities , from the core to the surface of the star .",
    "the most recent opal opacities @xcite which we refer to as opal96 , are used for temperatures above 9000 k and the opacity data discussed in the previous section is used for t @xmath47 9000 k. the equation of state discussed in section [ subsec : eos ] is used solely to calculate the number densities for use in the calculation of the low temperature opacities ( t @xmath47 9000 k ) .",
    "the opal02 equation of state provides the various thermodynamic quantities necessary for the calculation . to investigate the effects of h@xmath0   on these models we calculate models using 2 different low temperature opacity functions .",
    "firstly we perform a set of calculations using the @xcite h@xmath0   partition function and secondly we repeat the calculation while completely neglecting h@xmath0 .    it should be noted that the that the opal96 opacities are limited to values of @xmath48 1 , where @xmath49 .",
    "as the mass of a star decreases its density increases , such that for low metallicity stars of about 0.7  m@xmath3   and below , values of @xmath50 exceed 1 and can exceed 2 in a star of 0.4  m@xmath3 . in such circumstances",
    "we have extrapolated the opal96 opacity tables to higher values of @xmath50 .",
    "an extrapolation to @xmath51 requires an extrapolation of an order of magnitude in density or an extrapolation of just over a factor of 2 in temperature .",
    "however the region in which we are forced to extrapolate the opal96 opacities corresponds to the convective regions of the stars .",
    "as convective , and not radiative , energy transport is dominant the extrapolation of the opal96 opacities is unimportant . to test that this extrapolation is unimportant we perturbed the extrapolated opal96 opacity by multiplying by @xmath50 when @xmath521",
    "we found that the calculations performed with and without this opacity perturbation were identical .",
    "the minimum mass of star that we study is imposed by the boundaries of the opal02 equation of state tables .",
    "these equation of state tables do not cover all the temperatures and densities within our model stars of mass less than about 0.15 m@xmath3 .",
    "hence we limit our calculation to masses of 0.15 m@xmath3   and above .",
    "a gray atmosphere is used for the surface boundary condition , the temperature stratification follows a t(@xmath53 ) relationship based on hopf s law .",
    "a thorough discussion of this and other model atmospheres used in cesam can be found in @xcite . in the zero metallicity model atmospheres of @xcite ,",
    "significant differences between the gray and non - gray ( @xmath54 ) model atmospheres do occur for t@xmath55   @xmath47 4500 k. consequently for stars below this t@xmath55   gray atmospheres give relatively poor boundary conditions .",
    "non - gray atmospheres effectively increase the average atmospheric opacity relative to the gray case @xcite . in this work",
    "the inadequacies of the gray atmosphere are relatively unimportant , because this is primarily a differential study in which we seek to show that the use of the h@xmath0   partition function of @xcite causes h@xmath0   to have a greater effect on stellar evolution than previously thought . to enable us to calculate more realistic evolutionary models , we are in the process of calculating non - gray atmospheres for zero metallicity very low mass stars .    the initial conditions for our calculation are those of a collapsing pre - main sequence star at the top of the hayashi track , as described in @xcite .",
    "briefly the pre - main sequence star is in quasi - static equilibrium and energy is released only through gravitational collapse .",
    "the star is fully convective so that entropy is constant throughout the star .",
    "the initial conditions are described by a contraction constant , c. for a 1 m@xmath3   star @xcite suggests a contraction constant of 0.02 l@xmath3m@xmath56k@xmath57 . in this work",
    "we use a constant value of 0.015 l@xmath3m@xmath56k@xmath57 , we find that the value of the contraction constant has only a small effect the position of the resultant star upon the main sequence .",
    "our models are computed without mass loss and rotation .",
    "we follow @xcite and use an initial hydrogen mass fraction of x@xmath280.77 .",
    "we set the metal mass fraction to be z@xmath58 , this is low enough to make the effect of metals negligible , whist avoiding numerical problems with extremely low and zero values of z. this leaves a helium mass fraction ( y ) of marginally under 0.23 .",
    "figure [ fig : hr.to.0.4.ps ] shows the evolution paths of zero metallicity model stars between 0.4 and 0.15 m@xmath3   calculated with and without the effects of h@xmath0 .",
    "symbols are placed on the curves when the core hydrogen mass fractions are 10@xmath59 , 10@xmath60 and 10@xmath61 .",
    "initially the pre - main sequence stars of 0.4 m@xmath3   and less , with and without h@xmath0   contract along identical paths , the density within the atmosphere at this stage is too low for h@xmath0   to have any effect .",
    "as the star becomes more dense and before the stars reach the main sequences the paths separate as h@xmath0   starts to become the dominant positive ion within the atmosphere . at zero age",
    "main sequence the star with h@xmath0   has a lower t@xmath55   and luminosity , than the star in which h@xmath0   is not accounted for .",
    "this trend continues throughout the main sequence lifetime of the stars . for stars with higher masses of 0.5 and 0.45 m@xmath3",
    "we find that h@xmath0   affects the late pre - main sequence and early main sequence evolution , but that the evolutionary tracks on the main sequence converge as the star becomes hotter in the late main sequence , and h@xmath0   is destroyed .",
    "our evolution tracks are in agreement with the zero metallicity calculations of @xcite which cover masses greater than 0.7 m@xmath3   and also with @xcite which cover masses greater than 0.8 m@xmath3 .",
    "this tendency for model stars of less than 0.5 m@xmath3   with h@xmath0   to have lower t@xmath55   and luminosity than their counterparts without h@xmath0   is shown again in figure [ fig : isoc ] .",
    "this figure shows the 14 gyr isochrone for model stars calculated with and without the effects of h@xmath0 , with symbols placed at intervals of 0.05 m@xmath3 .",
    "the three curves represent models calculated using the @xcite h@xmath0   partition function , the @xcite h@xmath0   partition function and also neglecting h@xmath0 . for 14 gyr old stars of 0.15 m@xmath3 , the difference in t@xmath55   between models calculated with the @xcite partition function and those in which h@xmath0   is neglected is over 200 k and the difference in luminosity is about 18 % .",
    "the models calculated with the @xcite partition function show that h@xmath0   has a significantly greater effect , which extends to higher masses , than that predicted by models calculated with the @xcite partition function .",
    "this illustrates the importance of using the @xcite partition function in low mass evolution models .",
    "the luminosity and effective temperature of the 0.2 m@xmath3   and 0.15 m@xmath3   zero metallicity main sequence model stars of @xcite are also plotted in figure [ fig : isoc ] .",
    "as @xcite used the @xcite partition function , their results would have been expected to lie upon the isochrone calculated with the @xcite partition function .",
    "however the models of @xcite lie closer to the isochrone calculated with the @xcite partition function .",
    "@xcite used non - gray atmospheres whereas in this work we have used gray atmospheres , so the reason for this difference is likely to be due to the break down of the gray approximation in very low mass stars .",
    "@xcite commented that using non - gray models effectively increases the atmospheric opacity over gray model atmospheres .",
    "hence non - gray stars have a lower t@xmath55   than their gray counterparts .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : isoc ] that the strength of the effect of h@xmath0   increases with decreasing mass .",
    "as long as h@xmath5 remains the dominant source of opacity the strength of the effect of h@xmath0   will continue to increase with decreasing mass .",
    "the effect of h@xmath0   within the atmosphere will diminish when collision induced absorption becomes the dominant source of opacity , at about t@xmath62 k. however in a shell below the photospheres of such stars hotter denser gas exists in which h@xmath5 remains the dominant source of opacity and h@xmath0   will again affect opacity .",
    "figure [ fig : tc ] shows the evolution of the central temperature for model stars of mass 0.8 , 0.6 , 0.4 , 0.25 and 0.15 m@xmath3 , calculated with and with out the effects of h@xmath0 .",
    "again it is seen that h@xmath0   has no effect on the the central temperatures of model stars of mass 0.6 m@xmath3   and above . for the model stars of 0.25 and 0.15 m@xmath3   the increased atmospheric opacity due to h@xmath0   acts to reduce the central temperature .",
    "this in turn reduces the nuclear reaction rates and so increases the hydrogen burning lifetime of the model star .",
    "h@xmath0   also acts to reduce the pre - main sequence and early main sequence central temperatures of the 0.4 m@xmath3   model .",
    "however for most of the main sequence the central temperature of the 0.4 m@xmath3   model star which neglects h@xmath0   is cooler than the 0.4 m@xmath3   model which accounts for h@xmath0 .",
    "this results in a longer hydrogen burning lifetime for the model which neglects h@xmath0 .",
    "the reason for this is that the 0.4 m@xmath3   model star without h@xmath0   is fully convective at zero age main sequence . whereas the 0.4 m@xmath3   model star which accounts for h@xmath0   starts zero age main sequence with a radiative interior , but the model star which neglects h@xmath0   starts zero age main sequences with a fully convective interior .",
    "convective mixing in a fully convective star makes the hydrogen throughout the star available for fusion in the core .",
    "conversely in a star with a radiative interior there is only very limited mixing of material , so that only the hydrogen in the core is available for fusion .",
    "hence the convective model star without h@xmath0   has a longer lifetime than the radiative model star with h@xmath0 , even though the former is more luminous .",
    "it appears that h@xmath0   within the atmosphere , can have an effect upon the structure and energy transport mechanisms within these low mass stars that have interior temperature gradients close to the adiabatic temperature gradient .",
    "so slight changes in the temperature gradient brought about by increased atmospheric opacity can change the main energy transport method .",
    "all the stars of mass less than 0.4 m@xmath3   have a fully convective interior at zero age main sequence , all of the stars develop a radiative interior at some point later in their main sequence evolution . after developing a radiative interior",
    "the rate of evolution of the star along the main sequence increases dramatically .",
    "we have calculated new low temperature zero metallicity rosseland mean opacities using the latest collision induced absorption opacity data and with the latest h@xmath0   partition function and line opacity data .",
    "the results of this calculation confirm that at high densities and intermediate temperatures h@xmath0   becomes the dominant positive ion .",
    "furthermore using the h@xmath0   @xcite partition function instead of an older partition function , causes the temperature and density ranges at which h@xmath0   forms to expand as well as increasing its abundance by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "this in turn increases the abundance of electrons and hence h@xmath5 and other negative ions , thereby affecting the opacity of the gas by a greater degree than was previously thought .",
    "the h@xmath0   line opacity at certain temperatures and densities can contribute up to 15 % of the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "h@xmath0   lines may well be observable within cool population iii stars and all models of such stars should account for direct absorption by h@xmath0 .",
    "the new rosseland mean opacities have been included in evolution models of very low mass zero metallicity stars , enabling us to investigate the effect of h@xmath0   on the evolution of these stars . for late pre - main sequence and early main sequence stars of mass @xmath47 0.55 m@xmath3",
    "we find that h@xmath0   can cause the atmosphere to cool and the star to drop slightly in luminosity .",
    "for stars of 0.45 m@xmath3   and below this effect becomes strong enough to affect the main sequence structure and lifetime of the star .",
    "the results presented here show that as the mass of a zero metallicity star is reduced the effect of h@xmath0   upon its evolution , structure , luminosity and temperature increase . as the @xcite partition function is much larger than the partition function of @xcite , used by @xcite ,",
    "its corresponding effect on opacity is larger .",
    "hence if the effect of h@xmath0   continues to grow in objects of below 0.15 m@xmath3 , then h@xmath0   will effect the evolution of zero metallicity very low mass stars and brown dwarfs too a greater extent than previously believed .",
