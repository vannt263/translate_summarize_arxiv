    "cosmological and astrophysical observations provide growing evidence of the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in our universe .",
    "one of the favored candidates is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , a new stable neutral particle with typical mass in the 10  gev  tev range which interacts weakly  @xcite .",
    "these particles arise naturally in various extensions of the standard model of particle interactions ( sm ) , e.g. the lightest neutralino in supersymmetric models with r - parity conservation  @xcite , stable scalars in little higgs models  @xcite , the lightest kaluza - klein excitation of the sm fields in models with universal extra - dimensions  @xcite .",
    "direct searches for wimps look for the recoil energy of nuclei due to interactions with the dm particles passing through the earth  @xcite .",
    "wimp signatures can also be found indirectly , namely by observing gamma - rays , positrons , anti - protons and neutrinos produced in dark matter annihilations  @xcite . as the annihilation rate scales with the square of the dark matter density ,",
    "indirect signals are expected to be stronger where dm accumulates , as , for instance , the galactic center and astrophysical bodies .",
    "high - energy neutrinos are produced in the annihilation either directly or by subsequent decay of sm fermions and bosons  @xcite and their spectrum could provide information on the wimp mass , the wimp - proton cross section and the branching ratios of the various annihilation channels , and hence , on the dm properties .    searches for high energy neutrinos can be performed in erenkov neutrino detectors / telescopes  @xcite , as super - kamiokande ( sk ) , amanda , icecube , but no positive evidence has been found so far .",
    "however , these detectors are unable to fully reconstruct the neutrino energy and therefore can not provide information on the neutrino spectrum . in the case of small detectors with large photo - multiplier coverage , like sk",
    ", the size limits the maximum energy for which the events are contained , so only through - going muons are of interest for energies of tens of gev or higher . in the case of neutrino telescopes like icecube ,",
    "least granular , the size limits the energy threshold for detection . in both cases and for the energies of interest",
    ", these detectors can only count neutrinos above their energy threshold . on the other hand , different conceptual designs for detectors for future neutrino long baseline experiments",
    "show that magnetized iron calorimeter detectors ( mind )  @xcite , or its variants as monolith  @xcite or ino  @xcite , liquid argon time projection chambers ( lartpc )  @xcite and totally active scintillator detectors ( tasd )  @xcite are able to measure the energy and direction of the initial neutrino with good precision at energies of tens of gevs .    in the present letter",
    ", we restrict our analysis to mind , which are conceptually similar to the existing minos detector  @xcite but with a mass one order of magnitude larger . due to its ability for a precise muon charge discrimination",
    ", they have been proposed as ideal detectors for future neutrino factories .",
    "for the same reason , these detectors have also been considered as atmospheric neutrino observatories , opening up the possibility of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and the small mixing angle @xmath0 , due to matter effects in the oscillations of upward - going atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite . here , we reveal a novel aspect of mind  @xcite , showing that they might constitute excellent observatories to detect neutrinos from wimp annihilations . for a given value of the wimp mass , we study the neutrino signal from wimp annihilations in these detectors , and exploit their energy and angular resolution in order to reconstruct the neutrino spectrum and , ultimately , to study dm properties  @xcite . by measuring the branching ratios of annihilation into different channels and the wimp - proton cross section",
    ", these measurements could provide a unique opportunity for getting information on the wimp couplings with the particles of the sm .",
    "when a wimp goes through a celestial body , as the sun , it might interact elastically with the nuclei and get scattered to a velocity smaller than the escape velocity , remaining gravitationally trapped in the body .",
    "it will then undergo additional scatterings , settling in the sun core , giving raise to an isothermal distribution .",
    "the wimps so accumulated can annihilate with other wimps into sm particles , as quarks , leptons and , if kinematically allowed , gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "typically in the sun , for sufficiently high capture rate and annihilation cross section , equilibrium is reached and the annihilation rate is related to the capture rate @xmath1 as @xmath2 , which , for the sun , is given by  @xcite c _ & & 9 10 ^ 24 ^-1 ( ) ( ) ^3 + & & ( ) ( ) ^2  , where @xmath3 is the local wimps density , @xmath4 is the velocity dispersion of wimps in the halo , @xmath5 is the wimp - proton cross section , and @xmath6 is the wimp mass . the capture rate can be different by several orders of magnitude for spin - dependent and spin - independent interactions .",
    "typically , for most neutralino models as well as for kaluza - klein dm , the spin - dependent cross - section dominates over the spin - independent one .",
    "the opposite happens for scalar wimps .",
    "these scattering cross sections are constrained in direct dm searches  @xcite , which put very strong bounds on the spin - independent ones .",
    "since , in the earth , the abundance of nuclei with odd mass number is extremely small , the neutrino flux from wimp annihilations is strongly constrained by the bounds on the spin - independent cross section and would be too low to be interesting for detection in mind , lartpc or tasd .",
    "thus , for our purposes we will focus on wimp annihilations in the sun , for which the much more weakly constrained spin - dependent cross section may play the dominant role .",
    "high - energy neutrinos would be produced directly or indirectly via the decay of other products of the annihilations  @xcite .",
    "a broad spectrum of neutrinos is so generated and depends on the wimp mass and on the branching ratios into the various channels : = _",
    "i br_i  , [ eq : fluxes ] where the sum includes the possible annihilation channels with spectrum @xmath7 and branching ratio @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the sun - earth distance .",
    "if the dm is a majorana fermion , the annihilation amplitude into fermion pairs is proportional to the fermion mass , so that the neutrino channel is irrelevant and annihilations are dominated by heavy fermions , @xmath10s , @xmath11s , @xmath12s and , if kinematically allowed , @xmath13s .",
    "neutralinos can annihilate into fermions as well as gauge bosons and higgs and the dominant channels are controlled by the neutralino composition  @xcite .",
    "typically , for neutralinos lighter than the w boson , the annihilation into @xmath14 pairs gives the main contribution , with harder neutrinos from @xmath15 .",
    "for higher masses , the gauge bosons channels are allowed and can have the highest branching ratio .",
    "kaluza - klein wimps can annihilate directly into neutrinos  @xcite with a branching ratio of few per cent and would provide a specific signature with a peak in the neutrino spectrum at @xmath16 .",
    "their main annihilation channels are charged leptons and light quarks with the neutrino flux generated dominantly by the @xmath15 mode . in the following",
    ", we will treat the branching ratios as free parameters as their exact values depend on the type of particle considered and on its couplings .",
    "annihilations into @xmath11 s and gauge bosons produce a hard spectrum which peaks around 0.4  ( 0.5  ) for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) for the former channel and even at higher energies for the latter  @xcite .",
    "quarks hadronize producing a large number of mesons and baryons which subsequently decay producing a softer neutrino spectrum . for instance , neutrinos from @xmath10s and @xmath12s have a spectrum which peaks at energies @xmath19  0.15   or lower , depending on the wimp mass , and drops to zero around @xmath20  ( 0.60.7 )  @xcite .",
    "light quarks hadronize mostly in pions which , as muons , get stopped before decaying and therefore produce only low energy neutrinos .",
    "once produced , neutrinos propagate in the sun , being absorbed via charged - current interactions and loosing energy due to neutral - current ones .",
    "these effects , in addition to neutrino oscillations between different flavors , need to be taken into account  @xcite .",
    "high - energy neutrinos can be detected in neutrino detectors and stringent bounds have already been set  @xcite and will be further improved by neutrino telescopes  @xcite . however , as these experiments can not reconstruct the neutrino energy , they can only provide limited information on the neutrino spectrum . in order to reconstruct the _ neutrino spectrum _ , the analysis presented here exploits the _ energy and angular resolution _ of mind , which allow not only to measure precisely the energy and direction of muons produced by the charged current interactions ( cc ) of @xmath21 and @xmath22 but possibly also the energy of the electrons  @xcite , produced by @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) interactions .",
    "in addition , these detectors will be able to reconstruct the energy and angle of the hadron shower , so that a good energy and direction resolution for the incoming neutrino will be achieved .",
    "we show that the degeneracy among different parameters can be broken by using the muon and electron energy spectra . in particular , a larger annihilation rate",
    "could always be traded by a smaller branching ratio to a hard channel ( @xmath25 ) in absence of information on the spectrum .    in the following",
    "we will consider a light wimp candidate with @xmath26  gev and therefore , we will focus on its dominant annihilation modes for these masses , i.e. , @xmath27 ( hard ) and @xmath14 ( soft ) channels .",
    "note that the contribution from @xmath28 is similar to the one of @xmath14 but with a lower normalization  @xcite",
    ". this technique might not be competitive with neutrino observatories ( amanda and icecube ) for wimp masses @xmath29  gev , since the typical sizes of future mind , lartpc and tasd might not allow a precise measurement of high lepton energies .",
    "however , it should be noted that , even for high wimp masses , these detectors could be useful for detecting the low energy tail of the neutrino spectrum  @xcite . in our study",
    "we assume the mass of the wimp to be known and , for definiteness , we take @xmath30  gev and @xmath31  gev .",
    "let us now comment on our assumption of taking a given value for the wimp mass . by the time the detectors discussed in the present article are available , information on the wimp mass might be already available from the lhc ( large hadron collider ) and , possibly , a future ilc ( international linear collider ) as well as direct and indirect dark matter searches . with the start of lhc in 2008 , the neutral wimp candidate for the dark matter can be indirectly detected in an event looking for missing energy and missing transverse momentum . by a detailed determination of the kinematics of the quarks and leptons ,",
    "typically it might be possible to measure the wimp mass with a 10% accuracy  ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the prospected error depends strongly on the model of physics beyond the sm and the values of the parameters .",
    "for example , for the sps1a benchmark point , the lsp mass could be determined to be @xmath32  gev at the lhc and @xmath33  gev at the ilc  @xcite . for less favorable points in the parameter space , worse accuracies",
    "will be reachable .",
    "the value for the mass determined in collider searches could be used as input in our analysis , assuming that the observed wimp corresponds to the dark matter particle .    a model - independent determination of the wimp dark matter mass",
    "could also be obtained in direct dm searches which look for the nuclear recoil in an interaction between a wimp and a nucleus in the detector  @xcite .",
    "the recoil spectrum is strongly mass - dependent if @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , a supercdms - like experiment , with exposures of @xmath35 $ ]  kg  days and a spin - independent cross section close to the present bound @xmath36 , would be able to measure a light wimp mass with an accuracy of @xmath37 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for the case of spin - dependent cross sections with comparable statistics .",
    "nevertheless , these measurements are affected by the uncertainties in the wimp velocity distribution and in the local wimp distribution .",
    "a method which is independent of the wimp density and of the wimp - nucleon cross section has been also proposed  @xcite . by comparing the recoil energy spectrum in direct searches which use different detector materials ,",
    "it is found that a wimp mass smaller than 50  gev can be determined with a 1-@xmath5 error of 20% if a total statistics of 500 events is available  @xcite .",
    "information on the wimp mass could also be found from indirect dark matter searches .",
    "some information on the wimp mass could also be obtained from the angular distribution of neutrino - induced muons in large water - erenkov detectors  @xcite . on the other hand , as the wimp density in the center of galaxies is predicted to be enhanced , a high rate of wimp annihilation are expected and produce sizable fluxes of sm particles , as neutrinos , photons , quarks and leptons .",
    "high energy photons can be produced either directly or via the hadronic interactions in the interstellar medium .",
    "in the first case , the gamma spectrum presents a very clear signature with a peak at the wimp mass , allowing its precise determination . in the case of gamma - rays from primary hadrons ,",
    "the spectrum has a sharp energy cut - off in correspondence with .",
    "it has been estimated that glast could constrain the wimp mass at the 25% level , for @xmath38  gev , and future imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes , with sufficiently small energy threshold , could detect the peak from direct annihilation into photons  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the energy information in the wimp neutrino signal in the detectors considered in the present article could allow , in principle , to infer directly the wimp mass by exploiting the cutoff in the spectra .",
    "since the typical sizes of future mind , lartpc and tasd might not allow to have sufficient statistics at the tail of the spectrum , this measurement could be very challenging .",
    "a detailed analysis needs to be performed , but it is beyond the scope of the present study  @xcite .    we have computed the number of electron and muon neutrino - induced cc events for = 50  and 70  gev , by using the evolved neutrino spectra from ref .",
    "we have , conservatively , considered nine energy bins ( 5 gev bins from an energy of 5 gev for = 50  gev and 7  gev bins from an energy of 7  gev for = 70  gev ) , where the low energy cut is adopted to avoid the atmospheric neutrino background . with good statistics ,",
    "the precision in the measurement of , for @xmath39  gev , depends on the muon energy resolution of mind at energies @xmath40  gev , expected to be @xmath41 at @xmath42  gev and slightly worse for higher energies  @xcite .",
    "for an ideal detector with perfect lepton angular resolution , the atmospheric neutrino background would be reduced to the fraction of events within the angular size of the sun ( @xmath43  sr ) .",
    "however , the lepton does not travel in the same direction as the incident neutrino except when averaged over many events .",
    "we conservatively take the root mean square ( rms ) spread in direction between the incident neutrino and the lepton ( in radians ) as _ rms  , [ eq : rms ] where @xmath44 is the energy of the incoming neutrino . therefore",
    ", a very conservative approach is to sum over the atmospheric neutrino background contributions within a region of opening angle @xmath45 .",
    "the expected number of muon ( electron ) neutrino - induced events in the @xmath46-th bin is computed as a function of the wimp - proton scattering cross section and of the branching ratios into @xmath47 ( soft channel ) and @xmath27 ( hard channel ) , n_i,(e ) & = & n_t t _ e_i^e_i + de_d ( _ _ ( _ e ) ( e _ ) ^cc__(_e ) ( e _ ) . + & & . + _",

    "this fiducial volume @xmath55 is simply the detector volume @xmath56 . for muon - like contained - events , it depends on the detector geometry and on the muon range in iron @xmath57 . for a detector with cylindrical shape ,",

    "we approximate the muon energy by its averaged value , which for the energy range of interest is @xmath60  @xcite . also notice that the volume of detector available is a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath49 , which varies from 0 to @xmath61 in 12 hours .",
    "thus , for the assumed geometry , the effective volume will be maximal when the sun is at the horizon . on the other hand ,",
    "if a good energy resolution is achieved up to some energies even for partially - contained events ( by means of using the bending of the muon trajectory due to the magnetic field ) , the fiducial volume to be considered is @xmath56 .",
    "we will consider both cases , when partially - contained muon - like events are not included in the analysis and when all muon - like events with the interaction vertex in the detector contribute .",
