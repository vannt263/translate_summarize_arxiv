    "we would like to mention that recently the edge disorder effect on the electronic transport properties of graphene nanoribbons was studied using similar approach.@xcite    in the clean limit , the conductance of the zigzag ribbon can be given simply by the number of the conducting channel .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ribbon](b ) , there is always one excess left - going channel in the right valley ( @xmath4 ) within the energy window of @xmath87 .",
    "analogously , there is one excess right - going channel in the left valley ( @xmath5 ) within the same energy window .",
    "although the number of right - going and left - going channels are balanced as a whole system , however if we focus on one of two valleys , there is always one excess channel in one direction , _",
    "i.e. _ chiral mode .",
    "now let us inject electrons from left to right - side through the sample .",
    "when the chemical potential is changed from @xmath88 , the quantization rule of the dimensionless conductance ( @xmath89 ) in the valley of @xmath4 is given as @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the quantization rule in the @xmath5-valley is @xmath92 thus , conductance quantization of the zigzag ribbon in the clean limit near @xmath88 has the following odd - number quantization , i.e. @xmath93    since we have an excess mode in each valley , the scattering matrix has some peculiar features which can be seen when we explicitly write the valley dependence in the scattering matrix . by denoting the contribution of the right valley ( @xmath4 ) as @xmath94 , and of the left valley ( @xmath5 ) as @xmath95",
    ", the scattering matrix can be rewritten as @xmath96 here we should note that the dimension of each column vector is not identical .",
    "let us denote the number of the right - going channel in the valley @xmath4 or the left - going channel in the valley @xmath5 as @xmath97 .",
    "for example , @xmath98 at @xmath99 in the fig.[fig : ribbon](b ) .",

    "when the electrons are injected from the left lead of the sample and the intervalley scattering is suppressed , a system with an excess channel is realised in the @xmath5-valley .",
    "the scattering geometry is schematically drawn in fig.[fig : rmat ] .",

    "this indicates the presence of a perfectly conducting channel ( pcc ) only in the right - moving channels .",
    "if the set of eigenvalues for @xmath119 is expressed as @xmath120 , that for @xmath121 is expressed as @xmath122 , i.e. a pcc .",
    "thus , the dimensionless conductance g for the right - moving channels is given as @xmath123 while that for the left - moving channels is @xmath124 we see that @xmath125",

    "recently hirose _ et .",
    "_ pointed out that the chalker - coddington model which possesses non - square reflection matrices with unitary symmetry gives rise to a perfectly conducting channel.@xcite however , systems with an excess channel in one direction has been believed difficult to realize .",
    "therefore disordered nanographene ribbons with lri might constitute the first realistic example .",
    "it is possible to extend the discussion to generic multiple - excess channel model , where the @xmath131-pccs appear.@xcite such systems can be realized by stacking zigzag nanographene ribbons.@xcite the electronic transport due to pcc resembles to the electronic transport due to a chiral mode in quantum hall system.@xcite however , it should be noted that the pcc due to edge states in zigzag ribbons occurs even without the magnetic field .",
    "in our model we assume that the impurities are randomly distributed with a density @xmath132 , and the potential has a gaussian form of a range @xmath133 @xmath134 where the strength @xmath135 is uniformly distributed within the range @xmath136 . here",

    "the localization length is evaluated , by identifying @xmath150 . here , @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) for the system with ( without ) the perfectly conducting channel .",
    "interestingly , the variance for the lri case shown in fig.[fig : aveg](b ) has large values and slowly converges to zero toward the long wire limit . also , the variance for higher energy modes has double humps structure in the short wire regime , which is also indicating the unconventional behavior . such suppression of the fluctuation in the diffusive regime may be attributed to the level repulsion from the transmission eigenvalue of the pcc.@xcite note the variance is zero for @xmath153 , indicating the existence of the perfectly conducting channel .",
    "such peculiar features can not be seen for sri case , see fig.[fig : aveg_short](b ) for comparison .",
    "fig.[fig : dadep ] shows impurity range ( @xmath154 ) dependence of the averaged conductance for various fermi energy .",
    "clearly , it can be seen that the pcc develops in zigzag ribbons if the range of impurity gets larger than the lattice constant",
    ". however , the development of pcc gets moderate if the incident energy lies at a value close to the change between @xmath155 and @xmath156 for the ribbon without disorder .",
    "since at least one of subbands at these energy points gives zero group velocity , it can be considered that the intra - valley scattering becomes stronger .",
    "this feature is also for example visible in above calculations as the deviation from the limit @xmath157 for @xmath158 where the limiting value @xmath159 ( fig.[fig : aveg ] ) .",
    "this feature can be seen clearly in fig.[fig : fermidep ] and [ fig : fermidep4000 ] , which will be discussed later .",
    "we performed a number of tests to confirm the presence of this perfectly conducting channel .",
    "first of all , it exists up to @xmath160 for various ribbon widths up to @xmath161 for the potential range ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "moreover the perfectly conducting channel remains for lri with @xmath162 , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath163 .",
    "as the effect is connected with the subtle feature of an excess mode in the band structure , it is natural that the result can only be valid for sufficiently weak potentials . for potential strengths comparable to the energy scale of the band structure , e.g. the energy difference between the transverse modes , the result should be qualitatively altered.@xcite    as a further test we evaluate the distribution of the transmission eigenvalues and dimensionless conductance for fixed wire length . in fig.[fig : eigen5](a ) , the distribution of the eigenvalues @xmath164 of the hermite matrix , @xmath165 , is depicted for various wire lengths . with growing length @xmath140",

    ", we show the ribbon length dependence of the averaged conductance in fig.[fig : aveg_short ] . since sri causes the inter - valley scattering for any incident energy , the electrons tend to be localized and the averaged conductance decays exponentially , @xmath171 , without developing a perfect conduction channel .    in fig.[fig :",

    ", the averaged conductance also gradually decreases and the perfect conduction disappears for short - ranged impurities of @xmath173 . as we have already briefly mentioned , the sharp dips can be observed at energies where the number of conducting channels changes .",
    "also , the variances becomes relatively large at these energies .",
    "the drop of the conductance close to e=0 indicates that the two valleys are not well - separated in @xmath15-space , because the partial flat bands have finite curvature for narrow graphene ribbons such as @xmath8 . therefore , if the ribbon width widens , the perfectly conduction recovers even close to the zero - energy . in fig.[fig",
    ": fermidep4000 ] , similar figure for @xmath72 .",
    "in order to demonstrate that the qualitative difference between the two regimes , lri and sri , is indeed connected with trs , we study the effect of magnetic field coupling to the electrons through the peierls phase . for the time reversal symmetric situation resulting from sri scattering the magnetic field removing trs should have a stronger effect than for the case of lri where trs is broken already at the outset .",
    "we use the localization length @xmath174 as an indicator . in fig.[fig : xi ] , the field dependence of the inverse localization length is shown for various incident energies ( filled symbols for sri and empty symbols for lri ) .",
    "indeed the localization length displays a stronger field dependence than the lri . actually for lri",

    "as we have seen , zigzag ribbons with long - ranged impurity potentials retain a single pcc .",
    "this pcc originates for the following two reasons : ( i ) the spectrum contains two valleys ( two dirac @xmath177-points ) which are well enough separated in momentum space as to suppress intervalley scattering due to the long - ranged impurities , ( ii ) the spectrum in each valley is chiral by possessing a right- and left - moving modes which differ by one in number , and so scattered electrons can avoid in one channel backscattering . is the zigzag ribbon the only nanographene ribbon showing this effect",

    "we will show that the appearance of flat bands is a general features ( apart from armchair ribbons ) and yield a two - valley structure with chiral edge states similar to the case of zigzag edges .",
    "we start our discussion with the most simple edge shapes having translational symmetry along the zigzag axis , called _ bearded _ and _ cove_. although these two edges look rather artificial compared with the zigzag edge , they are interesting because they show very much the same non - bonding edge localization as the standard zigzag edge .    . ]    a bearded edge is derived from a zigzag edge by adding single @xmath3-electron hopping bonds on each boundary site as shown in fig.[fig2:hige2](a ) .",

    "the analytic solution of this flat band can be easily understood by the combination of two edge states for zigzag and bearded edges . in the region of @xmath257",
    ", the electrons are localized at the bearded edge , and in the region of @xmath258 , the electrons are localized at the zigzag edge . at @xmath259 ,",
    "the wavefunctions extend over the whole ribbon width .",
    "it should be noted that this ribbon is insulating at half - filling because the flat band has no dispersion and , thus , can not carry currents . moreover",
    ", there is an energy gap between the flat band and next subbands .    .",
    "]    cove edge is a zigzag edge with additional hexagon rings attached .",
    "a graphene ribbon with two cove edges is shown in fig.[fig2:cove](a ) . in fig.[fig2:cove](b ) , the band structure of a semi - infinite graphite sheet with a cove edge is shown .",
    "this case also provides a partly flat band in the region of @xmath254 like the zigzag edge .    .",
    "]    interestingly both bearded and cove graphene ribbons posses two well - separated valleys in momentum space and chiral modes in both due to the partially flat bands .",
    "thus in both case pcc are realized as long as the impurity potential is long - ranged .",
    "we extend our analysis to the electronic spectrum of nanoribbons for which the ribbon axis is tilted with respect to the zigzag axis and keep the balance between @xmath46- and @xmath47-sublattice sites .        in fig.[fig :",
    "cord](a ) , we show the definitions of coordinates and primitive vectors which specifies the geometry of the ribbon . for this purpose",
    "we introduce the two vectors , @xmath261 and @xmath262 , where @xmath263 are integers .",
    "the pure zigzag ribbon corresponds to @xmath264 and the pure armchair edge is given by @xmath265 .",
    "fig.[fig : cord](b ) and ( c ) show the energy band structures of ribbons with the general edge structures of @xmath266 and ( b ) @xmath267 and ( c ) @xmath268 are shown .",
    "as we expected , the partially flat bands due to localized edge modes appear which break the balance between left- and right - going modes in the two valleys .",
    "both examples are rather close to the zigzag edge so that the two valleys are well separated . in this case",
    "pcc can appear .",
    "if the geometry of the ribbons deviates more strongly from the zigzag condition , the valley structure will become less favorable for creating a pcc , as the momentum difference between valleys shrinks .",
    "it is important to note that the extended unit cell along these generalized ribbons reduces the valley separation drastically through brillouin zone folding .",
    "the length scale is the new effective lattice constant @xmath269 along the ribbon .   under these circumstances",
    "the condition for long - ranged impurity potentials is more stringent , @xmath270 being larger than @xmath271 and not @xmath35 .",
    "according to random matrix theory , ordinary disordered quantum wires are classified into the standard universality classes , orthogonal , unitary and symplectic .",
    "the universality classes describe transport properties which are independent of the microscopic details of disordered wires .",
    "these classes can be specified by time - reversal and spin rotation symmetry(table [ universalityclass ] ) .",
    "the orthogonal class consists of systems having both time - reversal and spin - rotation symmetries , while the unitary class is characterized by the absence of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the systems having time - reversal symmetry without spin - rotation symmetry belong to the symplectic class .",
    "these universality classes have been believed to inevitably cause the anderson localization although typical behaviors are different from class to class .",
    ".universality class [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ universalityclass ]    recently , the presence of one perfectly conducting channel has been found in disordered metallic carbon nanotubes with lri.@xcite the pcc in this system originates from the skew - symmetry of the reflection matrix , @xmath272,@xcite which is special to the symplectic symmetry with odd number of channels .",
    "the electronic transport properties such system has been studied on the basis of the random matrix theory.@xcite on the other hand , zigzag ribbons without inter - valley scattering are not in the symplectic class , since they break trs in a special way . the decisive feature for a perfectly conducting channel is the presence of one excess mode in each valley as discussed in the previous section .    in view of this classification",
    "we find that the universality class of the disordered zigzag ribbon with long - ranged impurity potential ( no inter - valley scattering ) is the _ unitary _ class ( no trs ) . on the other hand , for short - range impurity potentials with inter - valley scattering the disordered ribbon belongs to the _ orthogonal _ class ( with overall trs ) .",
    "this classification is compatible with the magnetic field dependence of the localization length @xmath149 as shown in fig.[fig : xi ] .",
    "consequently we can observe a crossover between two universality classes when we change the impurity range continuously .",
    "is the phase coherence length .",
    "@xmath273 is the width of graphene ribbons . ]",
    "analogous symmetry considerations can be applied to armchair ribbons . in this case",
    "the two valleys merge into a single one at @xmath179 .",
    "trs is conserved irrespective of the impurity potential range , if there is no magnetic field .",
    "consequently , disordered armchair ribbons belong always to the orthogonal class and do not provide a perfectly conducting channel . in view of the fact that graphene is known to be symplectic ( orthogonal ) for lri ( sri),@xcite it is quite intriguing to realize that the edges influence the universality class , as long as the phase coherence length is larger than the system characteristic size of the nanographene system . in the fig.[fig : crossover ] , the summary of the argument is visualized . in the nano - graphene ribbons with general edges ,",
    "since the two dirac points are separated in the momentum space with the order of @xmath274 , the characteristic length causing the crossover is @xmath275 .",
    "thus the ppc is expected to appear even in generic nanoribbons if the sample has only very slowly varying charge potential and the intervalley scattering is suppressed .",
    "the unusual energy dispersion due to their edge states gives rise to the unique property of zigzag ribbons . concerning transport properties for disordered systems",
    "the most important consequence is the presence of a perfectly conducting channel , i.e. the absence of anderson localization which is believed to inevitably occur in the one - dimensional electron system .",
    "the origin of this effect lies in the single - valley transport which is dominated by a chiral mode . on the other hand ,",
    "large momentum transfer through impurities with short - range potentials involves both valleys , destroying this effect and leading to usual anderson localization .",
    "the obvious relation of the chiral mode with time reversal symmetry leads to the classification into the unitary and orthogonal class depending on the range of impurity potential .",
    "since the inter - valley scattering is weak in the experiments of graphene , we may assume that these conditions may be realized also for ribbons .",
