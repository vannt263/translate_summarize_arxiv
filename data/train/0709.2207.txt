    "although currently relatively rare , redshifted absorption systems lying along the sight - lines to distant quasars are important probes of the early to present day universe . of particular interest",
    "are damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems ( dlas ) , which contain at least 80% of the neutral gas mass density in the universe @xcite .",
    "dlas are believed to be the precursors of modern - day galaxies and studies over a range of redshifts are important to establish the link between the early stages of galaxy formation and the galaxies known in detail today . however , despite their importance in the context of galactic evolution , the typical size and structure of dlas has long been an issue of much controversy , with models ranging from large , rapidly rotating proto - disks ( e.g. @xcite ) to small , merging sub - galactic systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , imaging of dla host galaxies at @xmath7 ( where the galaxy can be distinguished against the point spread function of the background qso ) , reveals a mixed bag of spiral , irregular , low surface brightness ( lsb ) and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this variety being confirmed by a blind 21-cm emission survey of local galaxies @xcite .    whatever their morphologies , the high abundance of cold neutral gas in dlas is expected to provide a reservoir for star formation at high redshift .",
    "however , abundances of ( the star forming ) molecular gas in dlas are exceedingly low ,  only being detected in a very few cases @xcite , which calls into question the ability of dlas to contribute significant star formation activity to the earlier universe @xcite . despite this , dlas exhibit a ( weak ) evolution of elemental abundance with redshift @xcite , which would be expected from the enrichment of the interstellar medium in each galaxy by successive generations of stars .",
    "additionally , for the -bearing dlas , the molecular fraction also exhibits an anti - correlation with redshift , and the fact that the metallicity evolution is significantly steeper for these dlas may suggest that these actually constitute a narrower class of objects ( or sight - lines ) than the general dla population @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the decrease of molecular fraction with look - back time indicates an evolution in the dust abundance , the general dla population shows no sign of reddening due to dust @xcite and that the -bearing dlas have optical  near - ir colours of only @xmath8 , cf .",
    "@xmath9 for the five oh absorbers towards reddened quasars @xcite . ] , which is also evident through a decrease in the dust depletion factor with redshift in the -bearing dlas @xcite .",
    "where the dla occults a radio - loud qso , the 21-cm transition can provide complementary data to that obtained from the ultra - violet lyman-@xmath0 observations ( which are redshifted into the optical band at @xmath10 ) .",
    "the former transition traces the cold gas , whereas the latter traces all of the neutral gas , thus providing a potential thermometer of the absorber .",
    "provided that the 21-cm and lyman-@xmath0 absorption arise in the same cloud complexes , the spin temperature , @xmath11 [ k ] , of a homogeneous cloud can be derived from the column density , @xmath12 [ ] , obtained from the lyman-@xmath0 , via @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the integrated optical depth of the 21-cm line . however , obtaining the spin temperature from a 21-cm observation is not quite so straightforward , since the observed optical depth of the 21-cm line also depends upon on how effectively the background radio continuum is covered by the absorber .",
    "specifically , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the depth of the line relative to the flux density and @xmath17 is the covering factor of the flux by the absorber .",
    "of the dlas searched ( and published ) in 21-cm absorption , there is currently a detection rate of slightly less than @xmath18% .",
    "most of these occur at @xmath19 , where there is a roughly equal number of non - detections .",
    "@xcite attribute this distribution to the low redshift dlas having a mix of spin temperatures , whereas the high redshift absorbers have exclusively high spin temperatures , resulting in the large number of non - detections at high redshift ( none then detected at @xmath20 ) . since all of the dlas identified as large spirals have low spin temperatures , whereas those identified with lsbs and dwarf galaxies , have higher spin temperatures , @xcite conclude that the dla host population consists mainly of the warmer dwarfs and lsbs at high redshift , which evolves to include a higher proportion of spirals at low redshift .",
    "however , there are several caveats regarding this conclusion :    1 .",
    "although @xcite have undertaken a careful analysis in order to obtain the most likely covering factors , estimating this from the flux of the compact unresolved component to the total flux of the quasar or by examining the quasar s spectral energy distribution , none of these methods provides any information on the size of the absorbing region .",
    "when such information is unavailable , more often than not in the literature the covering factor is usually assumed to have its maximum value of unity ( notable exceptions are @xcite , see table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "if in reality @xmath21 , this assumption would have the effect of assigning artificially high spin temperatures to dlas . in the case of @xcite , half of the 12 detections have @xmath21 and half @xmath22 , whereas for the non - detections , 10 out of 11 have @xmath22 , the vast majority of which ( 8) are at @xmath23 ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "if the @xmath24 degeneracy is left intact , there still remains a mix of values at low redshift , with exclusively high values at high redshift ( figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , of the non - detections only one morphology is actually known ( see fig . [ toverf ] ) , and although , due to their high `` spin temperatures '' , it is tempting to count these as non - spirals , this is not actually known .",
    "there are no host identifications at @xmath25 .",
    "4 .   furthermore ,",
    "figure 3 @xcite suggests that at @xmath26 spin temperatures in dlas are expected to exceed @xmath27 k , with half of these @xmath28 k , rendering these very difficult to detect .",
    "however , since then , 21-cm absorption has been detected at @xmath2 towards 0201 + 113 @xcite at a spin temperature of @xmath29 k ( for @xmath30 ) , when this was previously believed to have @xmath31  k @xcite . + additionally : 5 .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath32 per cent of the non - detections occult large background ( @xmath33 arc - sec ) sources and that 21-cm absorption tends to be detected towards these large sources only when the dla host has been identified as a spiral .",
    "6 .   again , although for the non - detections the morphologies are essentially unknown , lower covering factors , resulting in non - detections at high redshift , would also be consistent with hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios , where compact galaxies at high redshift evolve to include a higher proportion of larger galaxies in the more immediate universe .",
    "most recently , @xcite find that all of the @xmath34 absorbers have large dla - to - qso angular diameter distance ratios ( @xmath35 ) , whereas the @xmath36 absorbers have a mix of ratios .",
    "thus reproducing the `` spin temperature '' segregation of @xcite through geometrical effects alone . since the dlas with low ratios",
    "are almost always detected in 21-cm absorption , this and the other points suggest that the covering factor , rather than the spin temperature ( which could range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 k , @xcite ) , is the important criterion in determining whether 21-cm absorption is detected in a dla .",
    "we therefore expect 21-cm absorption to be readily detectable in dlas located along the sight - lines towards compact radio sources . in order to further address this , as well as finding new sources in which to pursue our primary objective , the measurement of cosmological variations in the fundamental constants at large look - back times ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", we are undertaking a survey for  21-cm absorption in the suitably radio - illuminated dlas yet to be searched : in section 2 we present the results of the first phase of this survey , observations of both low and high redshift dlas with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) . in section 3",
    "we discuss these and the other new results ( since @xcite ) in the context of factors affecting the detectability of 21-cm in dlas , as well as investigating correlations between the 21-cm line strength , mgii equivalent width and metallicity in these absorbers .",
    "the dlas were selected from the sloan digital sky survey damped lyman-@xmath0 survey data release 1 @xcite and the known systems also occulting radio - loud quasars ( @xmath39 jy ) as yet unsearched @xcitesjc / dla ] . of those redshifted into the wsrt s ultra high frequency ( uhf ) receiver bands , we selected an initial sample which gave a mix of low and high redshifts in order to test the arguments presented above . since we require deep observations in order to , at the very least , obtain useful limits ,",
    "each absorber was observed for 12.5 hours , which limited the number of sources to four , although a further two candidate sub - dlas were also observed along the line - of - sight to 1402 + 044 ( table [ res ] ) . with two dlas each at @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we prioritised according to highest neutral hydrogen column density , the largest background radio flux ( @xmath42 jy ) and the most compact background source size , in order to maximise the covering factor .",
    "unfortunately , this sample , prioritised by the first two criteria , gave a range of values for the radio source size ( @xmath43 , see table [ size ] ) , none of which are especially compact .",
    "however , in order to shed light on the above arguments , dlas occulting all radio source sizes should be searched .",
    "furthermore , at the time of application , the dla at @xmath44 towards 1622 + 238 was believed to be due to a spiral galaxy ( @xcite , although see @xcite ) and the background radio source size of @xmath45 is similar to that of the other spirals detected in 21-cm absorption ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all of the observations were performed in june and july of 2006 with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope in the netherlands . to cover the redshifted 21-cm line ,",
    "the uhf and 92-cm receivers were backed by a band - width of 5 mhz over 2048 channels ( dual polarisation ) , giving channel spacings of 0.85 to 1.9  ( for @xmath46 to 2.7 ) .",
    "this ensured that the observations not only covered uncertainties in the optical redshifts , but gave a fine enough resolution to avoid resolving out any possibly narrow absorption lines ; the full - width half maxima ( fwhms ) range from 4 to 53  for the dlas already detected in 21-cm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the two orthogonal polarisations ( xx & yy ) were used in order to allow the removal of any polarisation dependent radio frequency interference ( rfi ) . upon the removal of this , the polarisations were combined in order to maximise the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "for all of the observations , the quasars 3c48 , 3c147 and 3c286 were used for bandpass and flux calibration .",
    "the data were reduced using the miriad interferometry reduction package , with which we extracted a summed spectrum from the emission region of the continuum maps .",
    "0149 + 336 was observed in @xmath47 hour slots on 25 june 2006 , with the uhf - low receiver .",
    "however , in this band the rfi was severe , particularly in the xx polarisation . upon flagging this and the worst affected channels out of the yy data , rfi still dominated on each baseline at all time intervals and the remaining data were of too poor a quality to obtain an image ( fig .",
    "[ 0149 ] ) .",
    "after realising that 0149 + 336 was mistakingly observed in 10 second integrations , we switched to the default 60 seconds , making each slot 2.5 hours long , for which 0809 + 483 and the other remaining sources were observed for 5 slots .",
    "0809 + 483 ( 3c196 ) was observed on 2 july 2006 , with the uhf - high receiver .",
    "severe rfi in this band ( 783.8 to 788.2 mhz ) meant that one of the slots had to be removed completely .",
    "furthermore , for all of the slots , the xx polarisation had to be completely flagged from the baselines involving antenna 3 , leaving 76 full and partial ( xx or yy ) baseline pairs , over a total observing time of 7.5 hours , after the flagging of further time dependent rfi .",
    "the source was unresolved by the @xmath48 beam and the final extracted spectrum is shown in fig .  [ 0809 ] .",
    "1402 + 044 was observed on 1 july 2006 with the 92-cm receiver .",
    "although the strongest absorber towards this quasar would exhibit 21-cm absorption at @xmath49 mhz , the central frequency was offset from this ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ 1402 ] ) in order to also cover the other two absorbers in this band ( see table [ res ] ) .",
    "the observations were rfi free , except the last 2.5 hour slot , which was rejected along with the calibrator used after the run , 3c48 .",
    "this left 9.3 hours of good data and the rfi - free observations of 3c286 were used for the bandpass and flux calibration .",
    "thanks to the low degree of interference in this band , 91 full baseline pairs could be used .",
    "the source was unresolved by the @xmath50 beam .",
    "all but one of the features in the extracted spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ 1402 ] ) were noted to be due to rfi during the reduction process and occurred in one polarisation only .",
    "the exception is the `` absorption feature '' closest to @xmath51  ( fig . [",
    "1402 ] ) and thus the only confirmed dla ( with @xmath52 , table  [ res ] ) .",
    "this feature was present in both polarisations , each of which can be fitted by similar gaussians , giving @xmath53 & @xmath54  and fwhms of @xmath55 & @xmath56  for the xx and yy polarisations , respectively .",
    "these values agree to less than one channel width and give a redshift of 2.707 , cf .",
    "the quoted dla value of @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58 ( siii , 1526  ) and @xmath59 ( alii , 1670  ) , from the sloan digital sky survey . however , the fact that the depth of the feature differs significantly between each polarisation ( @xmath60 jy in xx & @xmath61 jy in yy ) , as well as these features also appearing at other locations in the image remote from the continuum source , forces us to conclude that this absorption feature is an artifact .",
    "1622 + 238 ( 3c336 ) was observed on 910 july 2006 with the uhf - high receiver . after flagging of time dependent rfi ,",
    "12.0 hours of good data remained , although there was some rfi remaining on some baselines , particularly in the xx polarisation .",
    "after further flagging , 63 full and partial pairs remained , resulting in a detection ( fig .",
    "[ 1622 ] ) .",
    "further details are given in @xcite , where this detection is reported and discussed .",
    "in table [ res ] we present our observations and derived results .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     references : k06 : @xcite , g07 : @xcite , k07 : @xcite , c07 : this paper .",

    "evn : ( european vlbi network @xcite , first : the very large array s `` faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres '' , nvss : `` nrao vla sky survey '' .    from this , we see that the two new high redshift end points ( 0201 + 113 & 0438436 ) occur towards the most compact background radio sources ( which are also compact in comparison to all of the dlas searched , table 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "this may indicate that the spin temperatures in these two dlas , whose host types are unidentified , are indeed higher than in the low redshift spirals , although still @xmath63  k. however , in the absence of any knowledge of the absorption cross section , this is still inconclusive .",
    "apart from these two new high redshift examples , the radio source sizes do not reveal much , with a very similar range of values between the detections and non - detections . while the only two significantly smaller radio sources illuminate dlas detected in 21-cm ,",
    "so does the largest , although the absorber towards 1622 + 238 may have an impact parameter @xmath64 kpc @xcite .",
    "the fwhm of 235 for the 21-cm absorption , which is over four times wider than any other dla and an order of magnitude wider than the average value , also suggests that this is a very extended absorption system @xcite .",
    "this emphasises the need for knowledge of the size of the absorbing region in relation to the background emission , as the size of the background source by itself gives an incomplete picture of the covering factor .      as discussed in @xcite , a major factor in determining",
    "the extent of the absorbing cross section in relation to the background emission is how much closer the absorber is to us than the emitter . at low redshifts ( @xmath65 ,",
    "see figure 3 of @xcite ) , the absorber / quasar angular diameter distance ratio ( @xmath66 ) follows the ( near ) linear increase with which we are familiar  move something twice as far and it appears to be half the size .",
    "however , beyond @xmath67 , the angular diameter distance begins to decrease and so the absorber and quasar are essentially at the same angular diameter distance for @xmath34",
    ". therefore the dla gains no advantage in its coverage by being at a lower redshift than the quasar and in fact , the larger the redshift of the quasar , the more the coverage is decreased .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ toverf ] , most of the non - detections may simply not have been searched deeply enoughsince the ordinate of fig .",
    "[ toverf ] is proportional to @xmath68 , this gives an accurate indication of the limits , although if the fwhm of the any non - detected 21-cm absorption is @xmath69 ( sect .",
    "[ these ] ) , the limits would be better than shown .",
    "the plot nevertheless gives a truer representation of the limits reached than the spin temperature plots of @xcite , where a covering factor is assigned .",
    "] , particularly if the host galaxies are non - spirals .",
    "statistically , however , combining the new with the previous results ( table [ new ] ) , at @xmath70 the binomial probability of obtaining 11 or more detections out of 13 dlas at @xmath71 splits the low redshift sample approximately in half and is where the increase in @xmath72 with redshift begins to lose its linearity .",
    "] , with 16 or more non - detections out of 22 dlas , sub - dlas and candidates and @xmath73 absorbers towards 1402 + 044 are not included .",
    "] , is 0.03% ( cf .",
    "0.06% previously ) , a significance of @xmath74 assuming gaussian statistics .",
    "this becomes 0.02% when no redshift partition is used ( @xmath75 out of @xmath76 detections at @xmath77 and @xmath78 out of @xmath79 non - detections at @xmath80 ) .",
    "now that we have recapped the factors which could determine whether 21-cm absorption is detected or not , we turn our attention to what could possibly determine the strength of the absorption , where detected .",
    "@xcite noted that , although the strength of the absorption appears to be correlated with the equivalent width of the mgii 2796   line , this is not decisive in whether absorption is detected or not : in fig .",
    "[ width ] ( top panel ) we see that the non - detections span a similar range of equivalent widths as the detections and that 21-cm absorption is detected down to w@xmath81  .",
    "although there is a strong tendency for 21-cm absorption to occur in dlas originally identified through the mgii doublet , @xcite argue that this is a mere consequence of the mgii selection bias towards low redshift absorbers and thus lower angular diameter distance ratios ( see their figure 3 ) .",
    "therefore the deciding criteria in regards to detectability may be related to the coverage , as discussed above . of course ,",
    "if the fit in fig .",
    "[ width ] ( top ) is an accurate indicator , again , the non - detections may not have been searched sufficiently deeply@xmath82 to overcome these low covering factors",
    ".    for strong ( w@xmath83  ) mgii absorption , characteristic of the dlas searched in 21-cm , the line is completely saturated and above these equivalent widths the profile traces the number of absorbing components ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". therefore the strength of the mgii absorption is dominated by the velocity structure . on the other hand ,",
    "the 21-cm absorption is optically thin , and therefore less susceptible to the same kinematics , although the top panel of fig .",
    "[ width ] suggests that this may nevertheless by important in determining the strength of the 21-cm profile . in order to verify this , in the lower two panels of fig .",
    "[ width ] we show the full width half maximum and the total velocity spread ( @xmath84 ) of the 21-cm absorption profiles ( obtained from the references given in table 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the non - parametric correlations are considerably more significant than for the line - strength correlation , suggests that the strength of the 21-cm absorption may indeed be dominated by the velocity structure and w@xmath85 , in a sample of five mgii/21-cm absorbers , was previously noted by @xcite [ figure 3.5 ] , who interpreted this as the spread of the 21-cm components being related to the mgii equivalent width and thus the number of mgii velocity components .",
    "] , although the spirals do introduce some scatter , perhaps due to a contribution from the large - scale galactic dynamics . in particular , 1622 + 238 ( fwhm = 235  and @xmath86 ) , which is more reminiscent of a large - scale emission profile , rather than the typical pencil beam absorption profile @xcite .",
    "in addition to the correlation between the mgii and 21-cm profile widths , a relationship between the velocity spreads of low ionisation lines and the metallicity has been well documented : @xcite originally noted a tentative correlation in a sample of 17 dlas , over the redshift range @xmath87 , with a similarly tentative correlation between [ zn / h ] and @xmath88 being found in a sample of 72 , over the range @xmath89 , by @xcite . from composites of 370 sdss spectra",
    ", @xcite found higher metallicities in the w@xmath90   sample than for @xmath91w@xmath92 , over both low and high redshift regimes .",
    "this was confirmed by @xcite with composites from nearly 6000 sdss spectra and metallicities obtained from zn , si , cr , fe and mn abundances .",
    "a correlation between the metallicity and velocity spread from individual systems was found by @xcite , using several low ionisation species ( oi , siii , feii , crii & sii ) , in 70 dlas and sub - dlas ( with @xmath93 ) ) by @xcite . ] over the redshift range @xmath94 .",
    "like @xcite [ and @xcite ] , the velocity spread is attributed to the galactic dynamics , indicating that the metallicity traces the mass of the galaxy with which the dla is associated .",
    "however , @xcite find , from a sample of 1806 mgii absorbers with w@xmath95  , that the halo mass and equivalent width are _ anti - correlated _ , thus leading @xcite [ see fig .",
    "[ m - w - radio ] ] to suggest that the velocity spread may be due to outflows of cold dusty gas , which enrich the gas with metals .",
    "finally , note that although the gas responsible for civ absorption is not believed to be the same as that evident through singly ionised absorption @xcite , a correlation between the metallicity and civ velocity spread has also been found @xcite .",
    "metallicity  velocity spread correlations are therefore common to both dlas and sub - dlas in a variety ionisation states .",
    "the fact the 21-cm line strength and width are both correlated with the velocity spread of the mgii therefore suggests that these should also follow the metallicity :    @xcite state that , due to redshift evolution , there is an anti - correlation between the spin temperature and metallicity in dlas , where the higher redshift absorbers have lower metallicities , resulting in higher spin temperatures @xcite . plotting this ( fig .",
    "[ kanekar ] ) , we see that with @xmath96 , the correlation is fairly significant , although treating the non - detections as detections decreases this to @xmath97 . since",
    "all but two of these are located far above the fit , the actual spin temperatures will be larger , further reducing this significance}\\lapp-2 $ ] if taking these limits as the spin temperature values . ] .",
    "the trend is , however , expected on the basis that metals provide radiation pathways ( e.g. @xcite ) , meaning that a higher metallicity gas is expected to have a higher cooling rate .",
    "furthermore , the metallicity is known to correlated with the molecular hydrogen abundance , which traces cold gas , at high redshift @xcite , further supporting a spin temperature  metallicity anti - correlation .",
    "this suggests that , for the detections at least , the covering factor estimates may be reasonable ( fig .",
    "[ kanekar ] , bottom panel ) , although it leads us to reiterate that the very high `` spin temperatures '' in the non - detections could in fact be due to overestimates in the covering factors of these dlas .",
    "as discussed previously , since the covering factor can at best be estimated for a very few sources , the spin temperature  covering factor degeneracy is best left intact , thus only utilising the values of _ known _ parameters . plotting this ( fig .",
    "[ toverf - m ] ) , we see that    there is more scatter than in the @xmath11 only plot , resulting in a slightly lower significance .",
    "however , in this case the non - detections have considerably less scatter and the fit suggests that we may be close to the sensitivities required to detect 21-cm in these dlas .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that these are still lower limits , although they are , on the whole , several factors lower than the `` spin temperatures '' implied by fig .",
    "[ kanekar ] , thus being more consistent with the implied correlation .",
    "more to the point , through retaining the @xmath98 degeneracy , only observed measurements are used .    from the enrichment of the interstellar medium by successive generations of stars ,",
    "a metallicity  redshift anti - correlation is expected . in conjunction with a possible spin temperature  metallicity correlation ( fig .",
    "[ kanekar ] ) , this could explain an increase in the spin temperature with redshift @xcite .",
    "however , from the results of @xcite and the flattening of @xmath99 at @xmath100 k ( fig .",
    "[ toverf ] ) , we believe that this may be artificial . in fig .  [ m - z ] we show the metallicity  redshift distribution for this sample , which due to the limited dataset , does not exhibit the metallicity  redshift relation , present in much larger @xcite or more homogeneous @xcite datasets .",
    "so , although a spin temperature  metallicity correlation may be expected , we suggest that this is not due to the spin temperature evolving with redshift .      in the optically thin regime ,",
    "the normalised 21-cm line strength is @xmath101 where here @xmath102 ( sect . [ these ] ) .",
    "therefore one has to be wary of over - interpreting the spin temperature ( as well as the covering factor ) : according to equation [ equ2 ] , fig .",
    "[ width ] ( top ) exhibits an increase in @xmath103 with the mgii rest frame equivalent width , which when combined with the metallicity  equivalent width relation ( fig .",
    "[ m - w - radio ] ) , would suggest that @xmath103 is correlated with metallicity , giving the anti - correlation between @xmath98 and [ m / h ] ( fig .",
    "[ toverf - m ] ) .",
    "however , @xmath103 is but a measure of the normalised 21-cm line strength ( equation [ equ2 ] ) , which , as seen from fig .",
    "[ width ] ( middle , bottom ) , may be a consequence of the kinematics , as is the mgii equivalent width .",
    "so what we are seeing here is that the velocity structure of the cold neutral atomic gas does share a degree of coupling with that of the singly ionised species .",
    "this confirms that the neutral and singly ionised gas are spatially coincident , as suggested by the correspondence of their strongest absorption components @xcite .",
    "therefore , any correlation with the metallicity could well be dominated by the left , rather than right , hand side of equation [ equ2 ] , more specifically @xmath104 , which , through its tracing of the mg ii velocity spread will also trace the metallicity . in order to determine which term on the left hand side of the equation is dominating the correlation with w@xmath85 , and thus [ m / h ] , in fig .",
    "[ tau - w ] ( top ) we show the optical depth of the 21-cm absorption against the mgii rest frame equivalent width and , as noted by @xcite , there appears to be little correlation between these two quantities .",
    "it therefore appears that the relationship between the 21-cm line strength and the mgii equivalent width ( fig .",
    "[ width ] , top ) , is predominately due to the 21-cm velocity spread ( fig .",
    "[ width ] , middle & bottom ) ( bottom ) cf .",
    "[ width ] ( middle & bottom ) , which is somewhat neutralised by normalising this by the column density ( fig .",
    "[ width ] , top ) .",
    "interestingly , although dlas at @xmath105 arise almost entirely from the mgii absorbers with @xmath106  , @xcite also find little direct correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath107 . ] .",
    "this confirms ( as shown by the statistics in fig .",
    "[ width ] ) that the kinematics of the 21-cm line is the key factor in giving a correlation between the 21-cm line strength and the mgii equivalent width , and therefore the metallicity .",
    "how this itself ties in with the right hand side of equation [ equ2 ] is more complicated , since , as discussed at length above , it is very hard to determine the degeneracy between these two unknowns . for example , a larger covering factor could well be manifest in larger observed velocity spreads of the 21-cm profiles , as seen for the spirals ( fig .",
    "[ width ] ) , particularly 1622 + 238 @xcite .",
    "conversely , the spin temperature could be anti - correlated with the velocity spread , although this would be counter - intuitive if the spin temperature is related to the kinetic temperature of the gas , a problem further compounded if the relationship in fig .",

    "[ toverf - m ] , were used . on the other hand , as expected , the spin temperature could indeed be directly anti - correlated with the metallicity ( through higher cooling rates ) , or the covering factor correlated , due to larger covering factors being associated with larger , more evolved galaxies . either , or both , of these scenarios could explain the relation seen in fig .",
    "[ toverf - m ] , although we know that for this sample the ratio between these two parameters shows no significant redshift evolution ( fig .",
    "[ toverf ] ) .    in light of these various possibilities ,",
    "once again it is prudent to leave the degeneracies intact and only conclude as far as @xmath108 } ,   \\label{equ3}\\ ] ] where the first and third terms are essentially @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "we have searched four sight - lines for 21-cm absorption in four dlas and two candidate sub - dlas with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope . this has resulted in one detection and four non - detections , with one observation being lost to severe radio frequency interference at 452 mhz . adding these to the results from other surveys since @xcite ,",
    "gives a total of six new detections ( three in confirmed dlas ) and eleven new non - detections ( five in confirmed dlas ) . from these and the previous results , we find :    1 .",
    "there is indeed a mix of spin temperature / covering factor ratios at low redshift , although at @xmath111 these are mostly close to the ( typical  k , but at redshift of @xmath112 this definitely does not contribute to an increase in the spin temperature with redshift . ] ) maximum value of @xmath113 k. this levelling off of the spin temperature at high redshift , confirmed by the two new high redshift detections @xcite , is consistent with the suggestion by @xcite that the spin temperature does not increase indefinitely with redshift .",
    "2 .   occulting extremely compact radio sources ( @xmath5 ) , these two new high redshift detections vindicate the prediction of @xcite that , despite extremely high `` spin temperatures '' , dlas should be detectable at high redshift , particularly through the targetting of those located towards compact radio sources .",
    "however , the radio sources illuminating the other new ( intermediate redshift ) detections , are not significantly smaller than those illuminating the non - detections ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the addition of the new search results increases the significance that the 21-detections generally have smaller angular diameter distances than their background quasars , thus maximising the covering factor through line - of - sight geometry @xcite .",
    "this results in a mix of distance ratios at low redshift , but exclusively high ratios at high redshift , as per the `` spin temperature '' distribution of @xcite . + as suggested by @xcite , since dlas originally identified through the mgii doublet generally have lower redshifts ( @xmath115 , in the optical bands of ground based telescopes ) than those identified through the lyman-  line ( @xmath116 ) , these will usually have low angular diameter distance ratios .",
    "this manifests itself as 21-cm absorption being more likely to be detected in mgii selected absorbers .",
    "this is evident in the fact that , although the 21-cm line strength is correlated with the mgii equivalent width , it is not decisive in whether 21-cm absorption is detected or not , with the non - detections spanning a similar range of equivalent widths as the detections .",
    "investigating this and other correlations further , we find : 4 .",
    "the relationship between the 21-cm line strength and the mgii equivalent width ( significant at @xmath117 ) is dominated by the velocity width of the 21-cm line , thus indicating a correlation between the 21-cm and mgii velocity profiles ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "since the mgii equivalent width is also correlated with the metallicity , this would suggest a 21-cm line strength ",
    "metallicity relation , which we find at a @xmath118 significance .",
    "such a correlation has previously been suggested , on evolutionary grounds , by @xcite .",
    "however , although the metallicity is known to decrease with redshift for larger or more homogeneous samples of dlas , no metallicity  redshift correlation is seen for this sample , suggesting that this relationship may be non - evolutionary in origin for the 21-cm absorbing dlas .",
    "this is confirmed by our finding that the @xmath24 ratio does not appear to exhibit an overall increase with redshift .",
    "although the relationships between these various parameters are expected to be complex and intricately interconnected , we suggest since @xmath119}\\propto{\\rm w}_{\\rm r}^{\\lambda2796}\\propto \\delta v_{\\rm mgii } \\propto \\delta v_{\\rm 21-cm}$ ] , that the observed 21-cm line strength ",
