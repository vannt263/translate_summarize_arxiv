    "one of the problems hindering wider commercial application of photonic crystals ( pcs ) is the difficulty in coupling pc waveguides to conventional dielectric waveguides or optical fibers . a possible solution consists in tapering the waveguide so as to achieve better coupling with the fiber ;",

    "the purpose of this work is to formulate a quantitative model of the beaming effect in pcs , taking explicitly into account the imaginary component of the leaky mode wave vector .",

    ", we consider a semi - infinite pc with possible surface reconstruction .",
    "the whole system is divided into three parts : the homogeneous region , the surface , and the underlying semi - infinite , but otherwise ideal , photonic crystal .",
    "the electromagnetic field in the homogeneous material is represented as a rayleigh expansion , i.e. , a linear combination of discrete plane waves , whereas in the semi - infinite crystal the field is expanded into the eigenmodes of the corresponding infinite structure ( a procedure suggested by istrate _",
    "et al._@xcite ) . since we are searching for states leaking energy _",
    "away from the surface _ , in both regions we only consider waves that propagate or decay in this direction ; the precise rules of choosing these waves are specified in the appendix . the complex band structure necessary to find the field representation in the pc is calculated by the differential method ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "the fields in the homogeneous region and in the pc are linked by the scattering matrix@xcite of the surface layer , which provides the necessary boundary conditions .",
    "this leads to a homogeneous system of linear equations , which must have a non - trivial solution for surface states to exist .",
    "the search for surface modes is thus reduced to a search for roots of the determinant of a matrix dependent on @xmath48 , @xmath49 and  @xmath50 .",

    "[ fig : freqdep ] , mentioned in the previous subsection .    the radiation pattern in the large - angle ( @xmath102 ) region is also affected by the field stemming from the outlet : the destructive interference of this field with that emitted from the corrugated surface causes an offset of the sidelobe positions .",

    "calculated with the approximate leaky mode structure factor [ i.e. , with the series in eq .",

    "[ fig : angulardep](a ) .",
    "however , the field structure at angles far from @xmath106 is seen to depend strongly on the structure factor ; in general , the radiation intensity obtained with the one - harmonic approximation is much smaller than that calculated without this simplification .",
    "this may be the reason why at low frequency values the model - predicted @xmath107 value is very small compared to that resulting from ms calculations , since for these frequency values the surface normal lies far from the direction @xmath108 .",
    "another difference between the theoretical plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : angulardep](b ) and the @xmath97 curve is a distinct dip of the latter at @xmath109 .",
    "this turns out to follow from surface wave reflections occurring at the crystal boundaries , which have been neglected in our model , but are of some importance for crystals with shallow corrugations ( involving weakly leaky modes ) or of small size ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : reflections ] .",
    "the dotted curve in fig .  [ fig : angulardep](b ) shows the radiation intensity angular dependence after taking these reflections into account , with the reflection coefficient at the surface termination calculated by the method outlined in ref .  . evidently , this curve is in excellent agreement with the results of ms simulations .",
    "lastly , let us consider the frequency @xmath110 , which lies to the right of the main peak in the @xmath111 curve shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freqdep](b ) , and for which the model - predicted radiation intensity at @xmath112 is too large . fig .",
    "[ fig : angulardep420](a ) , a counterpart of fig .  [ fig : angulardep](a ) , shows that at this frequency value the radiation stemming from the waveguide output has magnitude larger than in the low - frequency case analyzed previously .",
    "however , since in the small - angle region it is out - of - phase with the field produced by the leaky modes , the total radiation intensity becomes significantly smaller than it would be without the direct beam from the waveguide outlet .",
    "in addition , as indicated by fig .  [",
    "fig : angulardep420 ] , neglecting higher harmonics in the surface field expansion used in the model - based calculations leads to some overestimation of the leaky - mode - induced radiation intensity at @xmath113 .",
    "together , these two factors explain the theory - versus - simulation discrepancy observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : freqdep ] in the frequency range @xmath114 .",
    "as indicated in fig .  [ fig : freqdep ] , maximum beam collimation occurs at frequency value of around @xmath115 , which , according to fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersionbc ] , corresponds to surface modes with @xmath116 ( crystal  @xmath60 ) and @xmath117 ( crystal  @xmath61 ) _ rather than _ to modes from the center of the brillouin zone ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "incidentally , the @xmath118 modes , being delocalized ( propagative inside the crystal ) , could not be responsible for beaming .",
    "however , the nonzero real part of the wave vector of the surface modes for which maximum beaming is observed is easily explained on the basis of the model discussed in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "it is a consequence of the competition between the tendency to reduce @xmath119 in order to obtain better phase - matching of waves emitted from individual unit cells , and , on the other hand , the negative effect of too large a @xmath49 on the effective length of the ` grating ' . since in the negative-@xmath48 region",
    "a decrease in @xmath119 is always accompanied by an increase in @xmath49 , the most intensive beaming occurs for moderate ( ` balanced ' ) values of both parameters .",
    "the model also sheds new light on the fact that in negatively corrugated crystals the frequency value corresponding to maximum beaming lies remarkably close to that of the unperturbed surface mode from the brillouin zone center .",
    "this proves to be a resultant of two opposing effects .",
    "it has been pointed out@xcite that bringing surface cylinders closer to the bulk crystal causes a blueshift of the surface mode dispersion relation , due to a decrease of the fraction of electromagnetic energy contained within the dielectric . however , since beaming occurs at nonzero @xmath48 values , the shift starts from an initial frequency value lower than that of the brillouin - zone - center mode . as a consequence ,",
    "the resultant optimum beaming frequency is close to the original frequency of the @xmath118 mode .",
    "the accuracy of the model could be considerably improved by taking into account the radiation emitted directly from the waveguide outlet .",
    "this , however , would require a detailed investigation of the interactions between the outlet and the surface cylinders in its immediate vicinity , as these interactions determine the amount of power transferred to surface modes and that emitted directly into free space .",
    "an analytical formulation of these effects seems hardly feasible , though .",
    "we have presented a quantitative analysis of a model explaining the effect of surface corrugation on the collimation of radiation leaving the outlet of a photonic crystal waveguide , on the basis of the dispersion relation of leaky modes supported by the corrugated surface . the dispersion relation has been calculated and discussed for a number of surface terminations .",
    "the model has been shown to reproduce the basic features of the investigated effect , and the significance of the factors left out of account has been evaluated . besides clarifying the conditions necessary for optimum beaming , the model also explains the relative insensitivity of the maximum collimation frequency value to the degree of surface modulation .",
    "we believe our results will contribute to a deeper understanding of the physical grounds of the beaming effect .",

    "let us begin with the homogeneous region . here",

    "the obvious choice for the sign of @xmath124 is      so that the propagating harmonics carry energy in the @xmath126 direction , and the evanescent ones decay with @xmath127 .",
