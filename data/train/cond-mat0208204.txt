    "it has been argued @xcite that configurations at depinning can be mapped onto directed percolation in @xmath11 dimensions , which yields indeed a roughness exponent @xmath12 , a dynamical exponent @xmath13 , a velocity exponent @xmath14 and a depinning correlation length exponent @xmath15 . some higher dimensional extensions of these arguments in terms of blocking surfaces have been proposed @xcite , but there is , to our knowledge , no systematic field theoretical connection between these problems .",
    "recently we have reexamined the functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach , introduced previously @xcite to describe isotropic depinning to one loop within a @xmath16 expansion .",
    "we constructed @xcite a consistent renormalizable field theoretical description up to two loops , taking into account the main important physical feature   and difficulty   of the problem , namely that the second cumulant @xmath17 of the random pinning force becomes non - analytic beyond the larkin scale .",
    "the 2-loop result for the exponent @xmath18 shows deviations from the conjecture@xcite @xmath19 .",
    "the reason is the appearance of `` anomalous '' corrections caused by the non - analytic renormalized disorder correlator .",

    "we then introduce an equivalent description in terms of cole - hopf transformed fields .",
    "this description is not only much simpler to study in perturbation theory ( e.g. to two loops it reduces the number of diagrams by an order of magnitude ) , but it allows us to obtain a number of results to _ all orders_. we argue that the coefficient @xmath22 which measures the strength of the kpz non - linearity is uncorrected to all orders . we also determine a non - trivial subspace of the disorder correlators in the form of simple exponentials which is an exact invariant of the frg to all orders . in the cole - hopf variables",
    "it is reformulated as the field theory of a specific branching process , or equivalently reaction - diffusion process .",
    "our flow - equations allow to study both periodic disorder , relevant for charge density waves ( cdw ) , and non - periodic disorder , relevant for lines or interfaces in a random environment . in both cases",
    "we find several non - trivial fixed points .",
    "all these fixed points possess at least one unstable direction and should thus be associated to transitions .",
    "it seems that perturbatively the large scale behaviour is dominated by a runaway - flow , as it is in the standard kpz problem@xcite .",

    "analysis of the above mentioned invariant subspace suggests that the flow goes towards a specific branching process .",
    "the present rg analysis is however unable to attain the non - perturbative fixed point .",
    "thus , it also does not allow to strictly decide whether @xmath23 is the upper critical dimension of the anisotropic depinning problem , which is an open issue .",
    "finally , since there are indications that kpz terms may be needed in the description of the motion of a contact line @xcite , we have studied manifolds with long range elasticity and the simplest kpz term .",

    "it is crucial to determine whether this persists beyond one loop .",
    "if there were corrections to higher order this might allow for a non - trivial fixed point of @xmath168 and thus to fix @xmath18 . on the other hand , absence of corrections would imply that for @xmath169 , @xmath131 flows to infinity , which makes the existence of a perturbative fixed point doubtful . in the next section",

    "it is worth noting , that since kpz - terms are only generated above the larkin length , the frg flow below the larkin length ( as well as the value of this length ) is identical to the case @xmath94 .",

    "perturbation theory is performed with the standard response - function .",
    "we note a very important property : to contract @xmath190 with a disorder - insertion @xmath191 and focusing on @xmath192 ( not @xmath193 ) , one can decide to either contract @xmath192 standing outside the @xmath194 or inside . in the first place , this eliminates the factor @xmath192 , but leaves @xmath194 underived . in the second case ,",

    "one easily verifies that the latter case is reproduced upon contracting only the argument of @xmath194 . to see this , one performs the perturbation theory and finally takes the limit of @xmath202 .",

    "thus the new diagrams , in the presence of the kpz - term , can be deduced from those for @xmath94 by allowing additional contractions of a @xmath205 outside the @xmath194 . compared to performing calculations using ( [ msr ] )",

    "both fixed points should be separated by an instable fixed point , of which we will show that it is attainable perturbatively .",

    "quite generally one expects a critical value @xmath430 below which @xmath131 flows to zero and above which it runs away .",
    "a simple argument , confirmed by the more detailed analysis presented below , allows to estimate @xmath430 for small values of @xmath408 , i.e.  near @xmath431 .",

[ lf13a ] and [ lf15a ] respectively .",
    "one sees that there is a solution with a positive @xmath456 only if @xmath463 consistent with the linear stability analysis given above .",

    "one should however not expect too high a precision from this crude estimate .",
    "thus we have found a non - trivial fp for this problem .",
    "it continuously depends on @xmath470 and exists only for @xmath471 .",
    "the simplest scenario is that this fp is associated with the critical behaviour at the transition between the phase where kpz is irrelevant ( isotropic depinning ) and the phase where kpz grows ( anisotropic depinning ) . to confirm it and check that this fp has only one unstable direction one needs a more detailed numerical analysis .",
    "note that this is also indicated by an adiabatic approximation considering ( [ flowlambdalr ] ) alone and assuming that the disorder does not vary , which yields that the fp is repulsive if @xmath472 and attractive if @xmath473 .      in the periodic case ,",
    "since @xmath265 is requested at any fp , we see that we can not enforce the sr - elasticity coefficient @xmath421 to scale to 0 under renormalization , since the fp condition on @xmath131 implies that ( [ 3 ] ) vanishes .",
    "however if we start with a small ratio of @xmath474 or if the flow is such that this ratio gets small before we reach the fixed point , then it is legitimate to neglect the effect of @xmath398 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to that case , and study equations ( [ flowlambdalr ] ) , ( [ flowdeltalr ] ) searching for a fp .",
    "a more detailed numerical analysis of the flow equation is feasable .",
    "it can easily be seen that the form @xmath475 is not exactly preserved by the flow anymore ( e.g. @xmath476 yields a term proportional to @xmath477 through variations of @xmath478 which here flows ) .",
    "one can still however search for exponential fixed points since then @xmath478 does not flow .",
    "( [ flowdeltalr ] ) yields the conditions @xmath479 and we can set @xmath480 to ensure periodicity @xmath481 .",
    "we obtain the following fixed points : @xmath482 as well as two others @xmath483 and @xmath484 .",
    "the corresponding fp condition for @xmath131 gives @xmath485 the fp with a positive @xmath242 is the one of interest .",
    "it is again presumably the boundary between the zero and strong kpz phases .",
    "the value of @xmath486 is given by the positive root of @xmath487 which reproduces ( [ lf88 ] ) , @xmath488 , to lowest order in @xmath442 . one finds that @xmath489 increases monotonically with @xmath442 and diverges @xmath490 as @xmath491 .",
    "this suggests that for @xmath492 only the i d phase exist .",
    "in this paper we have reexamined the functional renormalization group approach to anisotropic depinning .",
    "this was mandatory since non - analytic renormalized disorder correlators were found to be crucial already for isotropic depinning and were neglected in previous approaches of ad .",
    "indeed we have shown that the non - analyticity of disorder arising beyond the larkin length is crucial to generate the kpz - term , a first explicit field theoretic demonstration of how these terms appear at depinning .",
    "the resulting anomalous terms in the @xmath0-function modify the flow compared to previous approaches in interesting ways .",
    "we found several non - trivial fixed points and for sr elasticity a cole hopf transformed theory which allows to simplify considerably perturbation theory and indicates that the kpz coupling @xmath22 is uncorrected to all orders .    for lr - elasticity",
    "we have found the domains of parameters belonging to i d and ad respectively .",
    "we found that for the experimentally interesting case of contact - line depinning , two phases exist , i d and ad , and that the kpz - coupling ( i.e.  the anisotropy ) should be large enough for the ad class to apply ( otherwise the i d exponents is expected @xcite ) . at the transition a larger value of @xmath493 ( with @xmath494 for the contact line )",
    "is obtained .",
    "this scenario could be checked in a numerical simulation . to make the comparison with experiments more accurate one should consider the more involved structure for the kpz terms unveiled in @xcite but this can be done by methods similar to the one introduced here .    for sr - elasticity",
    "we have found interesting new fixed points .",
    "a bit disappointingly , they possess one unstable direction and thus correspond to transient or critical behaviour , and not to the asymptotic behaviour which instead is controlled by a runaway flow to a regime not perturbatively accessible by the present method . on the other hand ,",
    "an encouraging result is that we found a class of disorder correlators ( in the form of exponentials ) which should be invariant to all orders .",
    "these correspond to a set of branching processes which look tantalizingly close to the ones introduced to describe reaction diffusion and directed percolation .",
    "more work is necessary to understand this simpler equivalent class of theories at strong coupling , as they may contain the key to this conjectured connection between anisotropic depinning and directed percolation ( in @xmath11 ) and its generalizations in terms of blocking surfaces ( in higher @xmath24 ) and ultimately an understanding of the upper critical dimension for this problem .    a posteriori , it is not suprising that the present approach yields again a flow to strong coupling kpz , as it does in the thermal version of the problem @xcite .",
    "it is possible that as in the thermal problem another representation , as e.g.  the directed polymer , better exposes the physics and in particular what is missed in the present approach .",

    "it may possess similar physics and thus be amenable to some extended frg approach which would better account ( as it does for the thermal problem ) for the coarse grained correlations in the @xmath498 direction a property clearly not taken into account by the present method , which treats correctly only correlations in the @xmath499 space .    it is a pleasure to thank m.  kardar , w.  krauth , a.  ludwig and a.  rosso for stimulating discussions .",
