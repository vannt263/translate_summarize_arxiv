    "fifth - generation ( @xmath0 g ) wireless communication systems aim to achieve ultra - high spectral efficiency ( se ) and orders - of - magnitude improved energy efficiency ( ee ) .",
    "it is also expected that @xmath0 g networks will operate in multiple tiers deploying ultra - dense small - cell base stations ( bss ) , e.g. , heterogeneous networks ( hetnets ) . however",
    ", a major bottleneck in ultra - dense hetnets is the cross - tier and co - tier interference . in order to harvest the full potentials of @xmath0 g",
    ", developing sophisticated interference handling tools is a crying need at the moment .",
    "traditional approach to dealing with the catastrophe of interference is to suppress or even kill the interference power in order to improve system performance @xcite .",
    "however , recent developments in interference exploitation techniques have revolutionised this traditional way of dealing with known interferences @xcite .",
    "constrictive interference ( ci ) precoding approaches suggest that interference power can even contribute to the received signal power if properly exploited @xcite .",
    "this concept imports a major breakthrough in designing wireless communication precoding when the interference is known at the transmitter .",
    "in particular downlink beamforming design can be significantly improved by symbol - level precoding of known interferences @xcite .",
    "the broadcast nature of wireless channels makes the communication naturally susceptible to various security threats .",
    "however , the security of wireless data transmission has traditionally been entrusted to key - based cryptographic methods at the network layer . recently , physical - layer security ( pls ) approaches have attracted a great deal of attention in the information - theoretic society since the accompanying techniques can afford an extra security layer on top of the traditional cryptographic approaches @xcite .",
    "pls exploits the channel - induced physical layer dynamics to provide information security .",
    "with appropriately designed coding and transmit precoding schemes in addition to the exploitation of any available channel state information ( csi ) , pls schemes enable secret communication over a wireless medium without the aid of an encryption key .",
    "the extent of eavesdropper s csi available at the transmitter plays a vital role in determining the corresponding optimal transmission scheme .",
    "if full csi of all the links is available at the transmitter , then the spatial degrees of freedom ( dof ) can be fully exploited to block interception @xcite .",
    "however , it is generally very unrealistic in practice . in particular",
    ", it is almost impossible to obtain perfect eavesdroppers csi since eavesdroppers are often unknown malicious agents .",
    "the situation can further worsen if multiple eavesdroppers cooperate in an attempt to maximize their interception through joint receive beamforming .",
    "hence the authors in @xcite considered robust secrecy beamforming design based on deterministic channel uncertainty models whereas @xcite considered probabilistic robust design .    to make physical - layer secrecy viable",
    ", we usually need the legitimate user s channel condition to be better than the eavesdroppers. however , this may not always be guaranteed in practice . to alleviate the dependence on the channel conditions",
    ", recent studies showed that the spatial dof provided by multi - antenna technology can be exploited to degrade the reception of the eavesdroppers @xcite . a possible way to do",
    "this is transmit beamforming , which concentrates the transmit signal over the direction of the legitimate user while reducing power leakage to the eavesdroppers at the same time .",
    "apart from this , a more operational approach is to send artificially generated noise signals to interfere the eavesdroppers deliberately @xcite .",
    "depending on the extent of eavesdroppers csi available at the transmitter , different strategies can be applied to generate the optimal an beams . if no eavesdroppers csi is available , then a popular design is the isotropic an @xcite , where the message is transmitted in the direction of the intended receiver s channel , and spatio - temporal an is uniformly spread on the orthogonal subspace of the legitimate channel ( see fig .",
    "[ sysmod_iso ] ) .",
    "this scheme guarantees that the intended receiver s ( ir s ) reception will be free from the interference by the an , while the ers reception may be degraded by the an . on the other hand , with knowledge of the eavesdroppers csi to some extent",
    ", one can block the eavesdroppers interception more efficiently by generating spatially selective an ( see fig .",
    "[ sysmod_spat ] ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , an antenna array based directional modulation scheme ( dm ) has been studied which enhances security through adjusting the amplitude and phase of the transmit signal along a specific direction by varying the length of the reflector antennas for each symbol while scrambling the symbols in other directions@xcite .",
    ".3     .3     .3     in this paper , we exploit the knowledge of interference available at the transmitter for improving security in wireless systems . in this context , we redesign an signals in the form of constructive interference to the ir while keeping an disruptive to potential eves .",
    "we consider a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) downlink system in the presence of multiple eves as shown in fig .",
    "[ sysmod_const ] .",
    "we aim at minimizing the total transmit power while boosting the received sinr at the ir as well as degrading the eves sinr in an attempt to keep the same below certain threshold .",
    "the benefits of constructive interference - based an precoding scheme is twofold compared to conventional an - based physical - layer security schemes considered in @xcite .",
    "firstly , the constructive an will boost the receive sinr at the ir as opposed to the conventional an - based schemes which attempt to suppress an signals along the direction of the ir . secondly , to achieve a predefined level of sinr at the ir , constructive interference based precoding scheme requires lower power compared to conventional an precoding , thus diminishing inter - user as well as inter - cell interferences .",
    "both perfect and imperfect csi cases have been investigated .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed constructive an precoding approach yields superior performance over conventional schemes in terms of transmit power as well as symbol error rate ( ser ) . for clarity",
    ", the contributions are summarized below :    * we first consider the case when csi is perfectly known and design two secure precoding schemes such that the an is constructive to the ir thus reducing the required transit power for given performance and secrecy constraints . * we then move one step further to design a precoder such that the an is simultentously constructive to the ir and destructive to eves , further reducing the required transmit power to guarantee security .    in all cases ,",
    "the proposed schemes outperform the conventional an - aided secure precoding schemes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_sys ] , the system model of a secret miso downlink system",
    "is introduced .",
    "the conventional sinr - constrained power minimization problem is discussed in section  [ sec_prob_form ] for the perfect csi case whereas in section  [ sec_prob_const_int ] , a constructive an - based solution to the secrecy power minimization problem has been devised . in order to further improve secrecy performance ,",
    "an is designed as constructive for the ir and destructive for eves in section  [ sec_dest_int ] considering perfect csi . on the other hand , robust constructive - destructive",
    "an precoding has been designed in section  [ sec_rob_const_dest ] .",
    "section  [ sec_sim ] presents the simulation results that justify the significance of the proposed algorithms under various scenarios .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in section  [ sec_con ] .",
    "we consider a miso downlink system where the transmitter ( bs ) equipped with @xmath1 transmit antennas intend to transmit a secret message to the ir in the presence of @xmath2 possible eavesdroppers .",
    "the ir and the eves are all equipped with a single antenna . in order to confuse the eves ,",
    "the bs injects an signals into the secret message in an attempt to reduce the receive sinrs at the eves .",
    "thus the received signal at the ir and those at the eves are given , respectively , by @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the complex channel vectors between the bs and the ir and between the bs and the @xmath8th eve , respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the additive gaussian noises at the ir and the @xmath8th eve , respectively .",
    "the bs chooses @xmath11 as the sum of information beamforming vector @xmath12 and the an vector @xmath13 such that the baseband transmit signal vector is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the confidential information - bearing symbol for the ir and @xmath16 are the an symbols in which @xmath17 denotes the number of an symbols .",
    "accordingly , the received sinr at the ir is given by @xmath18 and that at the @xmath8th eve is given by @xmath19 the transmit signal @xmath11 can also be expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "assuming constant envelop @xmath22 , the instantaneous transmit power is given by @xmath23",
    "we consider a power minimization problem for secure transmission of information to the ir . note that by minimizing the power we actually decrease the sinr at eves while maintaining the qos of signal reception at the desired destination .",
    "exploitation of the available knowledge of the an will boost the receive sinr at the ir . in order to satisfy the secrecy requirements ,",
    "conventional power minimization problem is formulated as    [ minp_conv ] @xmath24    the power minimization problem has been solved considering various system configurations @xcite .",
    "one conventional approach is to reformulate problem as the following sdp    [ minp_conv2 ] @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "conventionally , the non - convex rank constraint is dropped so that the relaxed problem can be solved using existing solvers @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been proved in @xcite that for a practically representative class of scenarios , the original problem can be solved optimally .",
    "although the solutions proposed in @xcite are optimal from stochastic viewpoint , the hidden power in the an signals has been treated as harmful for the desired information , and hence , either nullified or suppressed . in the following section , we endeavour to develop precoding schemes exploiting the an power constructively for the desired signal at the ir .",
    ".45     .45",
    "in this section , we take the above approach one step forward , by actively exploiting interference ( an in this case ) constructively for the ir to reduce the required power for a given snr threshold , while guaranteeing the secrecy constraint for the eves .",
    "we do this by optimizing the transmitted signal part ( @xmath28 in ) , which comprises of the desired symbol and the an symbols .",
    "the theory and characterization criteria for constructive interference have been expensively studied in @xcite . to avoid repetition ,",
    "we refer the reader to the above works for the details , while here we employ this consept directly to design our new optimization problems",
    ". the an signal will be constructive to the received signal at the ir if that moves the receives symbols away from the decision thresholds of the constellation ( e.g. real and imaginary axes for qpsk symbols in fig .",
    "[ const_bob ] ) .",
    "hence we intend to keep the angle of that part aligned with the angle of the corresponding desired symbol @xmath29 by appropriately designing the transmit beamforming vectors .",
    "we can do so by pushing the decision symbols towards the constructive regions of the modulation constellation , denoted by the green shaded areas ( cf .",
    "[ const_bob ] ) .    for constructive precoding ,",
    "the an signals received at the ir are not suppressed or nullified in contrast to the conventional use of an @xcite , rather optimized instantaneously such that it contributes to the received signal power .",
    "if the an signals can be aligned with the data symbols @xmath29 by properly designing the beamforming precoding vectors @xmath30 , then all an symbols will contribute constructively .",
    "accordingly , it can be shown that the receive sinr at the ir can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath31 note that the receive sinr at the ir has actually become snr after constructive an precoding .",
    "however , the sinr at the @xmath8th eve remains the same as in since no an signal has been made constructive to the eves .    thus exploiting an power constructively",
    ", the sinr constraint can be reformulated as the following system of constraints    [ sinr_const1 ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 indicates the real part of the complex number @xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the corresponding angle .",
    "note that the phases of the an signals in has been shifted by the phase of the desired symbol @xmath29 .",
    "the constraint imposes that the an fully aligns with the phase of the symbol of interest @xmath29 at the ir , whereas the constraint guarantees that the constructively precoded an signals can adequately satisfy the sinr requirement at the ir .    essentially , the angular constraint is a very strict constraint .",
    "but exploiting the concept of constructive interference , we can actually relax this constraint without losing any optimality which results in a larger feasible region .",
    "let us denote @xmath36 as the received signal ignoring the awgn at the ir , with constructive an injected , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the abscissa and the ordinate of the phase - adjusted signal @xmath39 , respectively . applying basic geometric principles to fig .",
    "[ const_bob ] , the constraints in can be equivalently represented as    [ sinr_const2 ] @xmath40    where @xmath41 indicates the imaginary part of the complex number @xmath34 .",
    "however , it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ const_bob ] that the an contaminated received signal @xmath39 does not necessarily need to strictly align the angle of the desired signal .",
    "that is , @xmath39 lays on the constructive zone of the desired symbol @xmath29 as long as the following condition is satisfied @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the constellation size .",
    "thus the strict angle constraint can be relaxed as @xmath46 interestingly , the qos constraint is embedded in .",
    "hence we do not need to explicitly include it in the constructive interference precoding optimization problem .",
    "thus the plain constructive interference based secure transmit precoding optimization problem can be formulated as    [ minp_const ] @xmath47    note that problem adopts the instantaneous transmit power ( including data symbols ) as the objective to minimize , as opposed to the average transmit power in conventional optimization framework . manipulating the constraint ,",
    "the problem can be reformulated as a standard socp , which can be optimally solved using optimization toolboxes , e.g. , cvx @xcite .",
    "note that the relaxed angular constraint allows a larger feasibility region ( entire green zone in fig .",
    "[ const_bob ] ) , which results in a lower minimum transmit power as we will observe in section  [ sec_sim ] .",
    "in this section , our attempt is to further improve the secrecy performance utilizing the concept of destructive interference for the eavesdroppers .",
    "the concept is that , we will design the an beamformers such that the an signal is constructive to the ir while destructive to the eves .",
    "as long as some knowledge of the eves channels is available at the transmitter , one can do so by pushing the received signal at the ir towards the decision thresholds ( green zone in fig .",
    "[ const_bob ] ) while pushing the received signal at the eves away from the decision thresholds ( red zone in fig .",
    "[ dest_eve ] ) .",
    "this makes correct detection more challenging for the eves by reducing the receive sinr .",
    "the benefit is that given secrecy thresholds can be guaranteed with lower transmit power .",
    "more importantly , it will be shown in the following optimization schemes that the secrecy constraints are guaranteed on a symbol - by - symbol basis , rather than the conventional statistical guarantees .    by denoting @xmath48 and @xmath49 as the real and imaginary parts of @xmath50 , respectively",
    ", @xmath51 will lay in the red zone in fig .",
    "[ dest_eve ] if either of the following two constraints is satisfied    @xmath52    that is , the sinr restriction constraints at the eves can be represented by the following system of inequalities    [ sinr_conste ] @xmath53 @xmath54    where @xmath55 . thus exploiting the knowledge of the interfering signals ( an in this case ) , the constructive an - based precoding design problem with secrecy power minimization objective can be formulated as    [ minp_dest ] @xmath56    problem is a standard second - order cone program , thus can be efficiently solved using interior - point based solvers @xcite .",
    "note that by the inclusion of the data vectors , the secrecy constraints are guaranteed on a symbol - by - symbol basis , as opposed to the conventional statistical secrecy @xcite .",
    "moreover , the virtual multicasting concept introduced in @xcite for a miso broadcast system is not applicable to the secrecy beamforming problem or .",
    "in the previous sections , it was assumed that perfect csi of all the nodes is available at the transmitter .",
    "however , that is a very strict assumption for many practical wireless communication systems . in particular , obtaining the perfect eves csi is always a challenging task .",
    "hence in this section , we study robust an precoding design for scenarios when the available csi is imperfect .",
    "we model the imperfect csi considering the widely used gaussian channel error model such that the channel error vectors have circularly symmetric complex gaussian ( cscg ) distribution .",
    "thus , the actual channels between the bs and the ir can be modeled as @xmath57 and that between the bs and the @xmath8th eve can be modelled as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the imperfect estimated csi available at the bs and @xmath61 , represent the channel uncertainties such that @xmath62 , and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "conventional an - aided downlink robust secrecy power minimization problem with sinr constraints is formulated as    [ rob_minp_conv ] @xmath64    due to the spherical channel uncertainty model , constraints and actually involve infinitely many constraints which makes the problem very difficult to solve . however , applying @xmath65-procedure ( * ? ? ? * lemma  2 ) , the inequality constraints in can be transformed into convex linear matrix inequality constraints and thus problem can be readily solved using existing solvers .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite that whenever problem is feasible , the corresponding transmit precoding solution is of rank - one hence optimal .      in this section , we aim at robust precoding design such that the an is constructive to the ir while destructive to the eves with imperfect knowledge of all csi . with the deterministic channel uncertainty model described above",
