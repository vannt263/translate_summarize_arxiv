    "<S> social networks often exhibit statistical structures that manifest themselves in scaling - laws which can be quantified through a set of characteristic exponents . maybe the three most relevant scaling laws in terms of network formation are the linking probability for new nodes joining the network as a function of degree of the existing ( linked - to ) node , the degree distribution , and the clustering coefficient of nodes as a function of their degree . in particular , the probability for a node to acquire a new link , the _ attachment kernel _ @xmath0 , often scales with the node degree @xmath1 @xcite as @xmath2 the degree distribution of social networks , i.e. the probability to find a node with a given degree @xmath1 , @xmath3 , often shows features of exponential , fat - tailed distributions @xcite or something inbetween , depending on the type of social interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they can be parameterized conveniently by the @xmath4-exponential @xcite , @xmath5 with @xmath4 a parameter that determines an asymptotic scaling exponent @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a third scaling law , which is ubiquitous in social networks @xcite , is observed for the clustering coefficients @xmath7 as function of node degree , @xmath8    despite the overwhelming empirical evidence for the scaling laws in equations ( [ scalingpi ] - [ scalingc ] ) , it is still undecided if they share a common dynamical origin , and if and how characteristic exponents are related to each other . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for growing network models , where new nodes are constantly added which link through a preferential attachment rule to already existing nodes @xcite , a relation between scaling exponents of the degree distribution and the attachment kernel @xmath9 has been found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these models can not explain the observed scaling of the clustering coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the preferential attachment process @xcite requires _ global _ information ( the degrees of all nodes in the network ) to establish a new social tie , which is clearly an unrealistic assumption for most social networks . to overcome this problem , growth and preferential attachment mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> have been extended by _ local _ network formation rules @xcite , where a node s linking dynamics only depends on its neighbors or second neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> one such local rule which is extremely relevant for social network formation is the principle of _ triadic closure _ @xcite , which means that the probability of a new link to close a triad is higher than the probability to connect any two nodes . </S>",
    "<S> scaling - laws for the degree distribution @xcite , degree distribution and clustering coefficients @xcite , and preferential attachment @xcite have been reproduced in the context of specific models using triadic closure , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> while it is instructive to see how a combination of growth , preferential attachment and clustering processes give rise to the three scaling laws above , this does not help us to understand if the existence and possible inter - relations of the three exponents can emerge from a single underlying dynamical origin , and to which extent this common origin is an actual feature of real social network formation processes . </S>",
    "<S> less is known on relations between characteristic exponents in non - growing , stationary networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that triadic closure is related to scaling - laws for the degree distribution and clustering coefficients in the stationary case @xcite .    here </S>",
    "<S> we study a simple model that simultaneously explains the three scaling laws in equations ( [ scalingpi ] - [ scalingc ] ) based on the process of triadic closure in non - growing networks . </S>",
    "<S> this process introduces a mechanism from which preferential attachment emerges , leads to fat - tailed degree distributions , and induces scaling of the clustering coefficients with node degrees . </S>",
