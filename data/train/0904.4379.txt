    "an important motivation of the theoretical search for a quantum theory of gravity is the expectation that the singularities predicted by classical general relativity would be resolved by the quantum gravity theory .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed by the recent study of certain isotropic models in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite , which is a simplified symmetry - reduced model of a full background - independent quantum theory of gravity @xcite , known as loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite . in loop quantum cosmological scenario for a universe filled with a massless scalar field ,",
    "the classical singularity gets replaced by a quantum bounce @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also revealed in the effective scenarios that there are great possibilities for a spatially flat frw expanding universe to recollapse due to the quantum gravity effect @xcite .",
    "however , as in the ordinary quantization procedure , there are quantization ambiguities in constructing the hamiltonian constraint operator .",
    "thus it is crucial to check the robustness of the key results against the quantization ambiguities .",
    "moreover , since lqc serves as a simple arena to test ideas and constructions induced in the full lqg , it is important to implement those treatments from the full theory to lqc as more as possible .    in the previous paper @xcite of this series of work , it has been shown that the above key features of lqc are robust against a quantum ambiguity arising from the quantization of the field strength of the gravitational connection . in this paper",
    "we will propose alternative versions of hamiltonian operator for isotropic lqc , which inherit more features from full lqg comparing to the conventional one so far considered in the literatures .",
    "it is well known that the hamiltonian constraint in the full theory is composed of two terms , the so - called euclidean and lorentz terms . in spatially flat and homogeneous models ,",
    "the two terms are proportional to each other .",
    "thus people usually rewrite the lorentz term in the form of the euclidean one classically and then quantize their combination @xcite . however , this treatment is impossible in the full theory , where the lorentz term has to be quantized in a form quite different from the euclidean one @xcite .",
    "the issue that we are considering is what would happen in the improved dynamics setting of lqc if one kept the distinction of the two terms as in full theory rather than mixed them .",
    "could one construct an operator corresponding to the lorentz term in a way similar to that in full lqg ?",
    "if so , could the classical big bang singularity still be replaced by a quantum bounce in the new quantum dynamics ? to answer these questions ,",
    "two alternative hamiltonian constraint operators including the lorentz terms are constructed respectively in the improved scheme in this paper , which are both shown to have the correct classical limit by the semiclassical analysis . in the spatially flat frw model with a massless scalar field ,",
    "the effective hamiltonians and friedmann equations are derived in both case .",
    "it turns out that the classical big bang is again replaced by a quantum bounce .",
    "moreover , there are still great possibilities for the expanding universe to recollapse due to the quantum gravity effect .    in the spatially flat and isotropic model",

    "one constructs a kinematical hilbert space @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the bohr compactification of the real line and @xmath15 is the haar measure on it @xcite .",
    "the abstract @xmath16-algebra represented on the hilbert space is based on the holonomies of the connection @xmath17 . in the hamiltonian constraint of lqg , the gravitational connection @xmath17 appears through its curvature @xmath18 .",
    "since there exists no operator corresponding to @xmath19 , only holonomy operators are well defined .",
    "hence one is led to express the curvature in terms of holonomies .",
    "similarly , in the improved dynamics setting of lqc @xcite , to express the curvature one employed the holonomies @xmath20 along an edge parallel to the triad @xmath21 of length @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a constant , with respect to the physical metric @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the identity @xmath26 matrix and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 are the pauli matrices ) .",
