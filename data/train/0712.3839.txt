    "since the first report giving evidence of the existence of an exotic baryon @xmath0 @xcite , many papers from both theoretical and experimental aspects have been published @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 was observed as a narrow resonance of a @xmath11 system , giving its minimum quark content as @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath0 would exist , it could have interesting consequences for non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the first observation by the leps collaboration was confirmed by several experiments @xcite .",
    "however , null results were also reported from several high energy experiments where they searched for the @xmath0 with much higher statistics @xcite . moreover ,",
    "some of the initial positive evidence was refuted by the same collaboration with higher statistics @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the leps and diana collaborations have shown new evidence supporting its existence .",
    "the leps collaboration shows a narrow peak in the missing mass spectrum of the @xmath13 reaction @xcite .",
    "the diana collaboration confirmed its initial positive evidence with two times larger statistics @xcite . in this controversial situation , it is quite important to perform other experimental searches that would reveal the production mechanism of the @xmath0 by using various reactions .",
    "if the @xmath0 exists , one of its most remarkable features would be its narrow width .",
    "the observed width is consistent with the experimental resolution in all positive experiments .",

    "such narrow width is unusual for a hadron resonance . in order to understand the narrow width",
    ", theoretical models were proposed that take into account an additional correlation between quarks @xcite .",
    "the different dynamics of several models results in different values of the spin and parity .",
    "therefore experimentally , if the @xmath17 exists , it is quite important to determine its spin and parity to understand the nature of the @xmath0 and hence its quark dynamics . for this purpose ,",
    "experiments with high statistics are needed .",
    "hadronic reactions fulfill these requirements , because the production cross section via a hadronic reaction is expected to be much larger than that of a photoproduction reaction .",
    "theoretically , the cross section of the @xmath7 reaction is expected to be @xmath1880@xmath5b @xcite .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy is another important point .",
    "because the width of the @xmath0 is expected to be narrow , high resolution is essential in order to measure its width with high experimental sensitivity .",
    "therefore we were motivated to do an experiment using a @xmath3 beam and a high resolution spectrometer to search for the @xmath0 with high statistics .    a different experiment ,",
    "the e522 collaboration , reported a search for the @xmath0 via the @xmath19 reaction @xcite , finding a bump structure near 1.53 gev/@xmath14 in the missing mass spectrum off the @xmath20 .",
    "the statistical significance of the bump was 2.5  -  2.7@xmath21 and was not sufficient to claim the existence of the @xmath0 .",
    "the upper limit of the production cross section was found to be 3.9 @xmath5b .",
    "this reaction is just the inverse reaction of @xmath22 . in both reactions ,",
    "the same coupling constants are used in the production diagrams .",
    "a deeper understanding on the production mechanism can be obtained by considering both experimental results .",
    "theoretical calculations in hadronic models using effective interaction lagrangians and form factors were made by several authors @xcite .",
    "they studied the @xmath0 production mechanism in @xmath23 and @xmath24 reactions near the production threshold comprehensively .",
    "in general all calculations predict a large production cross section for the @xmath7 reaction . for the production process",
