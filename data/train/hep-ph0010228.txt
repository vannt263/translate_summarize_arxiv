    "the quark - gluon plasma phase transition predicted by qcd @xcite may occur and manifest itself in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions through discontinuities in the initial energy density ( @xmath11 ) dependence of relevant observables .",
    "a major example of a discontinuity is seen in the @xmath6 @xcite discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we investigate here for the first time the dependence of strangeness production , in particular of kaons , on the initial energy density @xmath11 .",
    "the degree of equilibrium achieved in nuclear collisions has been intensively studied comparing hadron ratios and densities to models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we investigate here if chemical equilibrium is achieved , examining an other aspect of equilibrium states , namely the volume ( @xmath12 ) independence of hadron densities ( @xmath13 ) .    [ kaons ]    [ kaons ]",
    "the kaon density ( @xmath14=(k per collision)/v ) at the thermal freeze out in nuclear reactions , investigated as a function of the initial energy density @xmath11 ( figure 1,(a ) ) ( see @xcite for calculation details ) , exhibits a dramatic changeover around @xmath0=1.3 gev/@xmath1 , saturating for higher @xmath0 values , while it is falling below .",
    "error on @xmath11 is estimated to be @xmath7 30% .",
    "it is assumed that the number of nucleons participating in the collision ( n ) is proportional to the volume of the particle source at the thermal freeze out @xcite .",
    "the new results from si+au at 14.6 a gev and p+p at 158 a gev shown in figure 1 , which are not included in @xcite , have been estimated using data from @xcite and methods described in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 rises with n respectively with v below @xmath0=1.3 gev/@xmath1 while it does not depend on n respectively on v above @xmath0=1.3 gev/@xmath1 . to illustrate this , two values of @xmath12",
    "are noted on figure 1 .",
    "the changes of @xmath15 and @xmath16 with n within the pb+pb system , have been first realized in @xcite .",
    "a similar behaviour as the one seen in figure 1 , can be inferred for pions as well as for the @xmath17 ratio ( s.k .",
    "work in progress ) .",
    "the @xmath18 exponent of hadrons with ( u , d , s ) quarks above @xmath0=1.3 gev/@xmath1 , do not depend on the particle mass ( figure 2 , ( a ) ) . at @xmath191.3 gev/@xmath1 @xmath20 is near to one , as expected in case of a chemically equilibrated state , assuming n",
    "@xmath7 v. the deviations seen in @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 may be due to the transverse momentum acceptance . therefore , figure 2 ( a ) supports the assumption of a high degree of chemical equilibrium reached above @xmath0=1.3 gev/@xmath1 , among hadrons with u , d , s quarks .",
    "the @xmath18 exponent of kaons is found to depend strongly on @xmath24 for kaons ( figure 2,(b ) ) .",
    "therefore , below @xmath0=1.3 gev/@xmath1 , @xmath25 ( figure 1 and figure 2 ( b ) ) , @xmath26 and the @xmath17 ratio , show an increase with increasing @xmath27 respectively with @xmath12 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "firstly , kaons may achieve a higher degree of chemical equilibrium only for @xmath2 1.3 gev/@xmath1 , and may not be fully equilibrated below @xcite .",
    "the equilibration of strangeness is expected in a qgp and its observation at @xmath10 1.3 gev/@xmath1 could therefore be a sign of a transition to qgp . in this case",
    ", it is a transition from a non equilibrated hadron gas to an equilibrated qgp .",
    "it is therefore not a well defined phase transition in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "+ secondly , kaons can be in fact chemically equilibrated also below @xmath0= 1.3 gev/@xmath1 , and the change respectively the constancy of @xmath14 with @xmath28 and @xmath11 observed in figure 1 , can be a result of the increase of the freeze out temperature with @xmath11 below @xmath0= 1.3 gev/@xmath1 , respectively of the stability of @xmath29 above 1.3 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "this dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath11 , namely rising until it reaches a critical @xmath30 value and saturating above for all reactions , would strongly support the qcd phase transition appearing at @xmath31 1.3 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "this interpretation fully agrees with thermal models which suggest that particle ratios at freeze out are compatible with thermalization even in a+a collisions at 1 a gev @xcite .",
    "however the first interpretation is not in gross disagreement with @xcite , because there the thermal model description is modified ( introducing e.g. @xmath32 ) in order to describe the data at 1 a gev .",
    "furthermore , the correct interpretation can be corroborated by further investigations discussed in the following .",
    "the nonzero baryochemical potential ( @xmath33 ) , which in the reactions shown in figure 1 , happens to change with @xmath11 , makes the intepretation of figure 1 difficult .",
    "therefore , it appears that the dependence of the temperature at chemical freeze out extrapolated to @xmath34=0 , on @xmath11 , would help to identify and prove the qcd phase transition . a rising and then a for ever saturating freeze out temperature above",
    "@xmath0 1.3 gev/@xmath1 is a strong argument that the qcd phase transition occurs at this @xmath0 , and figure 1 is a direct consequence of it .",
    "the question if the qcd phase transition appears at the critical @xmath11 in any volume , or if there is additionally a critical initial volume of the particle source above which the transition takes place , can be answered comparing qgp signatures in systems with different volumes but the same @xmath11 .",
    "for example comparing @xmath35 , @xmath36 etc collisions to heavy ion collisions e.g. at the same @xmath0 .",
    "this is not yet done for the signature of the @xmath8 suppression and it has to be clarified e.g. using tevatron data @xcite . for the signature of strangeness enhancement",
    "it is suggested by figure 1 in @xcite that there is indeed a critical initial volume , only above which strangeness is enhanced over @xmath37 _ at the same @xmath11_. this conclusion follows , if we assume that tevatron reaches at least @xmath11 values similar to sps a+a collisions @xcite and if figure 1 in @xcite is not biased by the model calculation @xcite .",
    "if strangeness is indeed not equilibrated at @xmath38 gev/@xmath1 , this may explain the decrease of the double ratio ( @xmath17)(a+a / p+p ) with increasing @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , a larger strangeness annihilation is enforced by equilibrium at sps reducing the strange particle yield .",
    "however the assumption of non equilibrium of @xmath39 at low @xmath0 is not nessecary here , since the above observation can be possibly traced back to e.g. the variation of @xmath40 with @xmath24 in a+a collisions . furthermore , in the context of qgp formation , it seems irrelevant to discuss e.g. @xmath39 enhancement in a+b over p+p collisions in a nonequilibrium situation .",
    "it is the very establishment of equilibrium in the ( u , d , s ) sector , which can reveal informations on qgp .",
    "+ the kaon number densities in p+p and a+b collisions in figure 1 , ( a ) are similar , when compared at the same @xmath11 .",
    "see also @xcite for a discussion of universality of pion phase space densities .",
    "our prediction for the n dependence of hadrons at rhic and lhc is the @xmath41 thermal limit , as long as hadron yields are dominated by low transverse momentum particles .",
    "furthermore , if the changeover of @xmath25 at @xmath421.3 gev/@xmath1 shown in figure 1 is due to the qcd phase transition , we predict for rhic and lhc the same total strangeness ( or kaon ) number density and the same freeze out temperature , -after correction for the @xmath33 dependence- , as for @xmath421.3 - 3.0 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "if this change is however due to the onset of equilibrium in a hadronic gas , and the qcd phase transition takes place at higher @xmath0 , it may manifest itself through a second changeover of hadron number densities , ratios and freeze out temperatures -after correction for the different @xmath33- e.g. in rhic above @xmath43 @xmath7 3 gev/@xmath1 .    assuming that the imr dimuon enhancement seen by na50 is due to open charm",
    ", the following observations can be made : a ) open charm appears not to be equilibrated ( @xmath44 ) ( figure 2 , ( a ) ) @xcite .",
    "b ) the @xmath5 ratio deviates from p+p and p+a data also in s+u collisions ( figure 1 , ( b ) ) , above @xmath0 @xmath71 gev/@xmath1 .",
    "c ) it therefore appears that both charm and strangeness show a discontinuity near the same @xmath0@xmath71 gev/@xmath1 @xcite , similar to the critical @xmath451 - 2 gev/@xmath1 predicted by qcd @xcite .",
    "d ) the n dependence of the @xmath5 ratio can be interpreted as the @xmath8 being formed through @xmath46 coalescence @xcite .",
    "e ) finally , the enhancement factors of hadrons with u , d , s , c quarks may be connected in a simple way to the mass gain of these particles in the quark gluon plasma ( table below ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath47 are the enhancement factors of the lightest mesons with u , d , s , c quarks ( @xmath48 ) , if they are produced out of a quark gluon plasma ( e.g. @xmath49 ( 1 ) ) , as compared to their direct production from hadron interactions away from the transition point ( e.g. @xmath50 ( 2 ) ) .",
    "the gain is taken proportional to @xmath51 , as this expresses the different thresholds of reactions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . in the table below the predicted enhancement factors ( @xmath47 ) of hadrons with u ,",
    "d , s , c quarks from a qgp are compared to the experimentally measured ones ( @xmath52 ) , and are found to be similar .",
