    "mhd turbulence has attracted attention of astronomers since mid 1960s .",
    "as most astrophysical media are ionized , plasmas are coupled to the magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a simple one - fluid description known as magnetohydrodynamics or mhd is broadly applicable to most astrophysical environments on macroscopic scales . on the other hand",
    ", turbulence has been observed in various circumstances and with a huge range of scales ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as with hydrodynamics which has a `` standard '' phenomenological model of energy cascade ( kolmogorov , 1941 )",
    ", mhd turbulence has one too .",
    "this is the goldreich - sridhar model ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth gs95 ) that uses a concept of critical balance , which maintains that turbulence will stay marginally strong down the cascade .",
    "the spectrum of gs95 is supposed to follow a @xmath0 kolmogorov scaling .",
    "however , a shallower slopes has been reported by numerics , which motivated to modify gs95 ( see , e.g. , boldyrev 2005 , 2006 , gogoberidze 2007 ) .",
    "the other problem of gs95 is that it is incomplete , as it does not treat the most general imbalanced , or cross - helical case .",
    "as turbulence is a stochastic phenomenon , an average zero cross helicity does not preclude a fluctuations of this quantity in the turbulent volume .",
    "also , most of astrophysical turbulence is naturally imbalanced , due to the fact that it is generated by a strong localized source of perturbations , such as the sun in case of solar wind or central engine in case of agn jets .",
    "several models of imbalanced turbulence appeared recently : @xcite henceforth lgs07 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite henceforce pb09 , @xcite .",
    "the full self - consistent analytical model for strong turbulence , however , does not yet exist .",
    "in this situation observations and direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of mhd turbulence will provide necessary feedback to theorists .",
    "we concentrated on two issues , namely that a ) the energy power - law slopes of mhd turbulence can not be measured directly from available numerical simulations , supporting an earlier claim in bl09b , b ) the ratio of energy dissipation rates is a very robust quantity that can be used to differentiate among many imbalanced models .",
    "we believe , that taken together they resolve confusion related to the subject .    in what follows in",
    " 2 we briefly describe numerical methods ,  3 we show and discuss dissipation rates as the most robust measures in numerical turbulence , in  4 we argue that it is impossible to measure asymptotic spectral slopes of turbulence directly from currently available dns , in  5 we discuss the perspectives of using dns to constrain models , in  6 we present our conclusions .",
    "we solved incompressible mhd or navier - stokes equations :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a solenoidal projection and @xmath3 ( elsasser variables ) are @xmath4 and @xmath5 where we use velocity @xmath6 and magnetic field in velocity units @xmath7 .",
    "navier - stokes equation is a special case of equations ( 1 ) , where @xmath8 and , therefore , both equations are equivalent when @xmath9 .",
    "the rhs of this equation includes a linear dissipation term which is called viscosity or diffusivity for @xmath10 and hyper - viscosity or hyper - diffusivity for @xmath11 and the driving force @xmath12 .",
    "the special case of @xmath13 is a velocity driving .",
    "we solved these equations with a pseudospectral code that was described in great detail in our earlier publications bl09a , bl09b .",
    "table  1 enumerates latest high - resolution runs , which were performed in so - called reduced mhd approximation , where the @xmath3 component parallel to the mean field ( pseudo - alfvn mode ) is omitted and so are the parallel gradients in the nonlinear term ( @xmath14 . under these assumptions one studies purely alfvnic dynamics in a strong mean field , i.e. , alfvnic turbulence .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ experiments ]",
    "one of the most robust quantity in numerical simulations of mhd turbulence is the energy cascading rate or dissipation rate . in high - reynolds number turbulence energy has to cascade through many steps before dissipating and the dissipation is negligible on the outer ( large ) scale .",
    "therefore , nonlinear energy cascading rate and dissipation rate are used interchangeably .    in hydrodynamic turbulence",
    "the dissipation rate and the spectrum of velocity are connected by the well - known kolmogorov constant :    @xmath15    the important fact that strong hydrodynamic turbulence dissipates in one dynamic timescale @xmath16 is reflected by @xmath17 being close to unity ( @xmath18 ) . in mhd turbulence , however , there two energy cascades ( or `` elsasser cascades '' ) and there two dissipation rates , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the question of how these rates are related to velocity - like elsasser amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath22 is one of the central questions of imbalanced mhd turbulence .",
    "each model of strong imbalanced turbulence advocates a different physical picture of cascading and provides a different relation between the ratio of energies @xmath23 and ratio of fluxes @xmath24 .        goldreich - sridhar model ( gs95 ) predicts that in the balanced case the cascading is strong and each wave is cascaded by the shear rate of the opposite wave , i.e. ,    @xmath25    it is similar to kolmogorov cascade with @xmath26 s replacing @xmath27 .",
    "although this model does not make predictions for the imbalanced case , one could hope that in the case of small imbalance these formulae will still work . in this case",
    "we will obtain @xmath28 .",
    "lgs07 argued that this relation will hold even for large imbalances .    for the purpose of this short paper",
    "we mostly discuss the prediction of lgs07 , @xmath28 and the prediction of pb09 that nonlinear timescales are equal for both waves , which effectively lead to and @xmath29 over volume and time .",
    "this averaging does not take into account possible fluctuations in @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we believe , however , that these effects are small , as long as we use the second - order measures , such as energy .",
    "the issue of @xmath19 and @xmath20 fluctuations is investigated further in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath30 ( see corresponding equation in pb09 , @xmath31 ) . note , that the last prediction is also true for highly viscous flows ( @xmath32 . it could be rephrased that pb09 predicts turbulent viscosity which is equal for both components .",
    "compared to spectral slopes , dissipation rates are robust quantities that require much smaller dynamical range and resolution to converge .",
    "[ dissip ] shows energy imbalance @xmath23 versus dissipation rate imbalance @xmath24 for simulations i2 , i4 , i5 and i6 .",
    "we also use two data points from our earlier simulations with large imbalances , a7 and a5 from bl09a . i1 and i3 are simulations with normal viscosity similar to i2 and i4 .",
    "they show slightly less energy imbalances than i2 and i4 ( table  1 ) .",
    "we see that most data points are above the line which is the prediction of lgs07 . in other words",
    ", one can deduce that numerics strongly suggest that    @xmath33    although there is a tentative correspondence between lgs07 and the data for small degrees of imbalance , the deviations for large imbalances are significant .",
    "also , the numerics suggests that in the case of small imbalances the cascading smoothly transition to the balanced case , i.e. gs95 model , while in the case of strong imbalance it suggests that the strong component cascading rate is smaller than what is expected from strong cascading .    as to pb09 prediction ,",
    "it is inconsistent with data for all degrees of imbalance including those with small imbalance and normal viscosity , i.e. i1 and i3 .",
    ", of the linear dissipation written as @xmath34 , right panel : same for mhd turbulence .",
    "solid lines show @xmath35 , the conventional 3d spectra integrated over solid angle , while dashed lines show @xmath36 which is a fourier transform of a structure function . for more detail on @xmath35 and @xmath37",
    "see bl09b . ]",
    "most of the attention of the theory has been directed towards the self - similar ( or approximately self - similar ) regime between dissipation and driving which is colloquially known as `` inertial range '' ( kolmogorov , 1941 ) .",
    "although attempts to study this regime started long time ago , it it not until recently when simulations with resolution higher than @xmath38 has become commonplace . at this point",
    "the interpretation of numerical simulations of mhd turbulence has been strongly affected by experience obtained from hydrodynamic simulations .    in hydrodynamics ,",
    "the correspondence with kolmogorov slope has been fairly elusive slope for passive scalar in kolmogorov turbulence . ] for about a decade , even though the same simulations produced kolmogorov constants which were close to what has been observed earlier in experiments .",
    "the fact that such correspondence has been found in simulations with relatively small , less than a thousand , reynolds numbers , demonstrated that hydrodynamic turbulence is fairly local and in order to reproduce asymptotic cascading only a few steps in log - k space is necessary .",
    "the energy slopes , however , were affected by the bottleneck effect .    in mhd turbulence ,",
    "the observed flat ( power - law ) energy spectra has been prematurely interpreted as `` inertial range '' . however , as it turned out , the flat spectra of mhd turbulence is an indication of a _ lack _ of a good inertial range , rather than its presence . indeed , in simulations with hyperdiffusion we compared hydrodynamic and mhd slopes and found that while hydrodynamic energy spectra are highly distorted by bottleneck effect",
    ", the mhd spectra stay very flat ( see fig . [ bottle ] ) .    as it is not known a - priory what is the contribution of the _ systematic error _ of the spectral slope measurement that comes from bottleneck effect , it is therefore impossible to measure true asymptotic slopes directly . also , it is incorrect to claim that bottleneck effect is absent in simulations with second - order ( natural ) viscosity , as the existence of the effect was clearly demonstrated in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "[ bottle ] shows a comparison between hydrodynamic and mhd energy slopes in @xmath39 simulations .",
    "as we see , the spectra show a variety of bottleneck effects , depending on the order of viscosity and type of simulation ( mhd or hydro ) . also , there are two types of spectrum , @xmath35 and @xmath37 ( see bl09b ) and while @xmath35 is used in most numerical papers , it is @xmath37 , a fourier transform of the structure function which is directly predicted from kolmogorov model . while in the asymptotic regime of exact power - law scaling , @xmath37 and @xmath35 has the same slope , in a realistic numerical simulation they differ quite a lot . from fig .",
    "[ bottle ] it is not immediately obvious that mhd slopes are shallower than hydro slopes . most of the publications that made aforementioned claim had performed only mhd simulations and compared mhd slope with asymptotic kolmogorov slope , i.e. @xmath0 .",
    "our study bl09b reported that mhd turbulence is less local than hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by a ) the lack of visible bottleneck effect in mhd turbulence , while it was clearly present in hydro turbulence ( fig .",
    "[ bottle ] ) , b ) the dependence of kinetic and magnetic spectra on driving . indeed , in case with elsasser driving magnetic energy dominates by 20 - 30% ( see fig .",
    "[ 2048 ] ) , while for velocity driving this is not the case .",
    "an analytical bound for nonlocality can be obtained through hlger inequality and scalings of the turbulent fields @xcite .",
    "this bound is shown on fig .",
    "[ nonlocality ] . from practical viewpoint , however , this bound does not set a strict constraint on the `` width '' of the energy transfer window , @xmath40 , which describe the energy transfer between wavevectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 , as the maximally efficient transfer at @xmath41 could still be much lower that the estimate provided by hlger inequality .",
    "we conclude that , from practical standpoint , mhd turbulence can still be `` diffuse local '' i.e. less local than hydrodynamic turbulence despite this analytical bound .",
    "although in this short paper we mostly relied on robust quantities , such as total energies and dissipation rates , we believe that numerical simulations have a wealth of data to be analyzed by theorists .",
    "one of the most important measures not mentioned in this paper is the anisotropy of mhd turbulence . it had been considered in great detail in our earlier publication bl09a . in particular , we refer the reader to the result of bl08 , bl09a that the anisotropy of strong component is smaller than the anisotropy of weak component . this fact is inconsistent with both the naive application of gs95 critical balance ( which would have predicted the opposite ) , or the derivation in lgs07 that suggests that the both waves have the same anisotropy .",
    "we believe it is incorrect to rely only on one particular measure obtained from simulations , such as the slope of a particular type of spectrum of the _ total _ energy ( see fig .  [ 2048 ] for difference between magnetic and kinetic spectra , or fig .",
    "[ bottle ] for difference between @xmath35 and @xmath37 . ) to compare theories and simulations .",
    "( for definition , see * ? ? ? * ) which has upper bounds @xmath43 from theory , due to constraints on @xmath44",
    ". however , this upper bound , in practice , could be consistent with both rather `` local '' transfer ( upper solid curve ) or `` non - local '' or `` diffuse - local '' transfer ( lower dashed curve ) . for more study of energy transfer from simulations",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "pb09 claims that the nonlinear timescales for both components are equal , i.e. there is a turbulent viscosity which is the same for both components , regardless of the degree of imbalance .",
    "this seems counter - intuitive for transition to freely - propagating alfvenic waves ( i.e. infinite imbalance ) .",
    "the formula in pb09 , @xmath31 suggests that the asymptotic ( @xmath45 ) prediction for energy imbalance in this case will be the same as in highly viscous case ( @xmath46 ) , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "this is at odds with numerical evidence , which suggests @xmath47 .",
    "pb10 claimed that the disagreement between their model and numerics in bl09a is only exhibited in highly imbalanced simulations .",
    "this is incorrect .",
    "in fact , bl09a studied a range of imbalances @xmath48 starting with 1 ( balanced case ) and also 2 , 10 and a 30 .",
    "all of them , including one with small imbalance , showed significant inconsistencies with pb09 model .",
    "also , as we showed in this paper , the asymptotic regime of very small imbalances show the same inconsistency with pb09 .",
    "unfortunately , pb10 only dealt with the issue of the spectral slope , which is notoriously difficult to measure .",
    "we , however , believe that the total dissipation rates present a more robust measure and provides an acid test for any local theory of imbalanced turbulence .    in bl09a we discovered and described in detail an empirical fact that one can not simulate large imbalances with normal ( n=2 ) dissipation .",
    "this empirical fact also suggests that the strong component , @xmath49 in our notation , have much larger nonlinear timescale than the weak component @xmath50 .",
    "this is supported directly by the time evolution of @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "4 of bl09a ) and by the shorter inertial range of @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "10 of bl09a ) . in a subsequent publication , pb10 have found a similar empirical evidence , in particular they claim that a resolution of @xmath51 is required to simulate imbalances of @xmath52 and one needs to increase the resolution by a factor of @xmath53 where @xmath54 is @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "however , this empirical fact directly contradicts to the claim of pb09 model that both timescales are the precisely the same , due to `` dynamic alignment '' .",
    "as pb09 predicts the same nonlinear timescales for both components , they must have _ the same _ dissipation cutoffs .",
    "this is contrary with what is observed in numerics .    motivated by longer nonlinear timescales of the strong component we used hyperdiffusion in this paper , as well as bl09a .",
    "the dissipation for @xmath57 hyperdiffusion is a steep function of wavenumber ( cutoff scales as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the slope ) , this allowed us to ensure that dissipation is kept fairly close to nyquist frequency even for strong component , thus allowing us to simulate large imbalances .",
    "in this paper we mostly studied the regime of small imbalances in mhd turbulence . in this regime imbalanced mhd turbulence",
    "is similar to the balanced mhd turbulence in a sense that the cascading will be similar to one in gs95 model ( or lgs07 ) , i.e. , both waves will be cascaded strongly and the ratio of energies will be determined by @xmath28 .",
    "larger imbalances show that @xmath60 , which suggests that weak component does not have enough amplitude to provide strong cascading for opposing strong component ( bl08 ) .",
    "also we show that pb09 model that claim the same nonlinear timescales for both components due to `` dynamic alignment '' strongly contradicts numerical evidence ."
