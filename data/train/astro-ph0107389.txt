    "one of the key parameters in the standard big bang model is the density of ordinary baryonic matter , expressed as a fraction of the critical density , @xmath3 ( often quoted in combination with the hubble parameter as @xmath4 ) .",
    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) has traditionally been the primary theoretical tool for determining @xmath4 , and has recently been complemented by detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy .",
    "these results are to be compared to direct surveys of cosmic baryonic matter . while baryons are readily observable in stars or stellar remnants , galaxies , x - ray - emitting hot gas , as well as intergalactic gas , the low - redshift baryonic budget ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles @xcite ) is uncertain , and leaves some room for dark baryonic objects .",
    "conversely , at higher redshifts , ( @xmath5 to 3 ) a new estimate of @xmath4 based on the measurement of lyman alpha forest intergalactic absorption lines ( and also lines ) in the spectra of remote quasars has been done and is in good agreement with @xmath4 derived from bbn ( in the range @xmath6 to @xmath7 , riedeger @xcite , wadsley @xcite ) .",
    "this is between 3 and 20 times the observed baryon density in the luminous parts of galaxies and their presumed precursors , the damped lyman alpha intergalactic neutral hydrogen clouds , amounting to @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( proux 2001 ) .    at the local scale ,",
    "machos , with masses of about 0.5 @xmath10 and detected by gravitational microlensing towards the lmc , are possible candidates for some of the dark baryons , and amount to @xmath11 of the dark halo ( alcock 2000 ) .",
    "recently , old halo white dwarfs may have been detected in sufficient numbers to amount to @xmath12 of the dark halo .",
    "these white dwarfs , if halo members , represent a large increment , by a factor @xmath13 , relative to disk white dwarfs , and hence would have a profound impact on galactic chemical evolution . in this paper",
    "we discuss the implications of the discovery of dark baryons in the form of old halo white dwarfs for bbn , and in particular for the deuterium abundance .",
    "the standard model of bbn has enjoyed great success in its ability to predict the primordial abundances of the light element isotopes , d , 3 , 4 and 7 .",
    "indeed , in the standard model , there remains only one remaining unknown parameter , the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath14 , which can be expressed as @xmath15 .",
    "roughly , for a value of @xmath16 between 1.7 and 7.4 , ( corresponding to @xmath4 between 0.006 and 0.027 ) , we obtain concordance between the bbn predictions and the observational determination of the abundances ( nollett & burles 2000 ; vangioni - flam , coc , & cass 2001 ; cyburt , fields , & olive 2001 ) . in detail , however , there are small but perhaps not insignificant differences in the determination of @xmath4 from the different isotopes . 4 and 7 concordance is typically achieved for lower @xmath17 whereas d / h is best fit at higher values . to be sure , not every isotope serves as an equally good baryometer .",
    "in fact , because of the weak logarithmic dependence on @xmath17 , 4 is the worst element to use to fix the baryon density .",
    "while the 7 abundance strongly depends on @xmath17 , the theoretical uncertainties which stem from uncertainties in the input nuclear cross - section make it difficult to derive precise values of the baryon density .",
    "in addition , because of the functional dependence of 7 on @xmath17 , a given observational abundance of 7 gives us two predictions for @xmath17 .",
    "d / h , on the other hand , is both strongly dependent on @xmath17 and is relatively free from theoretical uncertainties .",
    "one should bear in mind however , that there are far more observational determinations of 4 and 7 at the present time than there are of d / h from quasar absorption systems .",
    "nevertheless it is the range in d / h , reported to span up to a factor of 20 , that has been the center of much controversy over the past decade because of the strong sensitivity to the baryon density .",
    "the reported d / h abundance has now converged towards the lower end of this range , but recent measurements reveal a spread by up to a factor of 3 that may reflect intrinsic variations in the d / h abundance .",
    "these variations would most plausibly arise from stellar processing of primordial gas , or possibly from non thermal processes such as photodisintegration by gamma rays , or spallation reactions induced by energetic particles .",
    "the recent results boomerang yield @xmath18 ( netterfield 2001 ) , in very good agreement with the estimate from d / h .",
    "this is also in agreement with the recent results of dasi ( pryke 2001 ) , who find @xmath19 .",
    "there have also been several new observations of d / h from quasar absorption systems .",
    "in addition to the earlier determinations by burles and tytler ( 1998a , b ) in two lyman limit systems of @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the upper limit in a third lyman limit system by kirkman ( 1999 ) of 6.8 @xmath22 , there have been three new measurements of d / h in damped lyman @xmath23 systems by omeara ( 2001 ) : @xmath24 , by dodorico ( 2001 ) : @xmath25 , and by pettini and bowen ( 2001 ) : @xmath26 all times @xmath27 .",
    "this last value is uncertain due to the poorly defined level of the continuum and the possible blending of lines ( p. petitjean , private communication ) .",
    "we note that there is also a measurement of d / h in a relatively low redshift system with significantly higher d / h ( webb 1997 ; tytler 1999 ) .",
    "this system has recently been criticized ( kirkman 2001 ) and we will not consider it further here",
    ".    is there a real dispersion in d / h in these high redshift systems ?",
    "we note two possible trends that go in a similar direction .",
    "the data may show an inverse correlation of d / h abundance with si .",
    "this may be an artifact of poorly determined si abundances , or ( as yet unknown ) systematics affecting the d / h determination in high - column density ( damped lyman-@xmath23 , hereafter dla ) or low - column density ( lyman limit systems ) absorbers .",
    "on the other hand , if the dispersion in d / h is real , it has profound consequences , as it must indicate that _ some processing of d / h must have occurred even at high redshift_. the second trend is that the data may show an inverse correlation of d / h abundance with hi column density . if real , this would suggest that in the high column density dla systems , which are most likely to have undergone some star formation , some processing of d / h must similarly have occurred , likewise at high redshift .",
    "it is interesting to note that local d values measured in the interstellar medium also appear to show a considerable dispersion .",
    "linsky @xcite summarized the observations then available and argued for a constant value in the local ism of @xmath28 .",
    "recent data ( see vidal - madjar 2001 , for a review ) are consistent with this mean value , but suggest significant variations of the d / h ratio spanning the range @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "thus , if d shows such variability , perhaps correlated to some unexpected physical processes leading to its destruction , one can , in turn , question the ability of cosmological clouds to represent the genuine primordial abundance .",
    "thus , a simple average of d / h abundance determinations does not make sense , at least without a proper enlargement of the error in the mean due to the poor @xmath31 that such a mean would produce .",
    "moreover , if deuterium destruction has occurred , we must question the extent to which any of these systems determine the value of @xmath3 .",
    "there is one obvious objection to the hypothesis that nucleosynthetic processing might have occurred in the high - redshift systems .",
    "the absorbing systems have low metallicity .",
    "we now point to seemingly unrelated observations that indicate that primordial processing may have occurred , and with substantially less enrichment than is associated with standard yields for a solar neighborhood initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "a substantial population of low luminosity white dwarfs has recently been discovered ( oppenheimer  2001 ; ibata  2000 ) .",
    "these objects were identified by their large proper motion , indicating halo kinematics .",
    "oppenheimer  find that if the objects are a halo population of white dwarfs , then they represent a fraction @xmath32 of the dark halo mass .",
    "there has been some question about whether these objects do reside in the halo ( hansen 2001 ; reid , sahu and hawley 2001 ) , but a recent re - analysis of the data by koopmans & blandford @xcite also concludes that these are halo objects , and finds a similar mass budget to that of oppenheimer we now address the potential implications of any observed dispersion in d / h in high redshift quasar absorption systems for a relationship between the possibility of d / h destruction in these systems by intermediate mass stars and the ensuing production of a population of halo white dwarfs .",
    "we summarize the importance of d as a baryometer , and its relation to the other light element abundances , in  2 . in ",
    "3 we argue that the observed dispersion in high - redshift d / h , if real , can not be accounted for by standard chemical evolution models . thus , an explanation of such a dispersion will necessarily involve nonstandard scenarios , involving , e.g. , variations in the imf , or outflows of material .",
    "we search for models which can explain this dispersion as well as the white dwarf observations .",
    "we find that such models can be constructed , assuming an initial burst of intermediate - mass star formation .",
    "it is also necessary that the c and n yields of zero metallicity stars are small , as suggested by some recent models .",
    "the prospects for testing this model and the implications for bbn are summarized in  4 .",
    "as discussed above , each of the light elements can be individually used to determine @xmath4 with varying accuracy . for example",
    ", a helium mass fraction of y = 0.238 corresponds to @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "however , the systematic uncertainties in the 4 abundance make it difficult to exclude values of y as high as 0.25 ( see for example , olive & skillman 2001 ) which because of the weak dependence on @xmath35 corresponds to @xmath36 or @xmath37 . with 7 one can do much better .",
    "a plateau value of 7/h = 1.2 @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath39 and 3.1 .",
    "however , the slightly higher value of 7/h = 2 @xmath40 ( consistent within systematic uncertainties ) yields @xmath41 and 4.5 . while there are occasional attempts to further increase the 7 abundance on the basis that some 7 has been depleted ( vauclair & charbonnel 1998 ; pinsonneault 1998,2001 ; theado & vauclair 2001 ) , it is very hard to do so , due to recent 6 observations which leave little room , if any , for 7 depletion ( fields & olive 1999 ; vangioni - flam 1999 ) and the lack of dispersion in the li data ( bonifacio & molaro 1997 ; ryan , norris , & beers 1999 ; ryan 2000 ) .    in contrast , the strong dependence of d / h on @xmath35 makes deuterium a very good baryometer , provided we have an accurate determination of d / h .",
    "the values of d / h measured in the high redshift systems however cover the range @xmath42 for d / h = 4 @xmath22 to @xmath43 for d / h = 1.65 @xmath22 . thus if the dispersion in the d / h is real ( beyond observational error as the quoted error bars imply ) , then one can question the extent that any of these determinations truly represent the primordial d / h abundance .    in the event that the dispersion is real , some amount of d / h must have been destroyed , presumably by stellar processing . since @xmath44 is monotonically decreasing in time , the primordial value should be greater than or equal to the maximum of the observed values",
    ".    stellar processing must involve short - lived stars of intermediate or even larger mass .",
    "the intermediate mass stars are the proposed white dwarf precursors .",
    "however , even an imf peaked near 2 - 8 @xmath45 could include some massive stars above 10 @xmath45 that would explode as snii and produce the heavy element enriched observed in the absorption systems .",
    "an inverse correlation of d with si abundance is a natural consequence .",
    "since these enriched systems are preferentially the more massive and advanced with respect to disk formation , as we discuss below , they might also have higher gas column densities and account for the additional inverse correlation of d with hi column .",
    "the high column density quasar absorption systems are generally considered to be protogalactic disks . in particular dlas have the kinematics and ionization characteristic of the interstellar medium of massive protodisks .",
    "lyman limit systems have a greater extent and display higher ionization than the dlas . star formation with a normal imf",
    "could not possibly have occurred in these systems to any substantial extent .",
    "typical metallicities are 0.1 to 0.01 solar , and this is consistent with these systems being predominantly gaseous .",
    "however in order for there to be enough halo white dwarfs to account for the recent observations , the primordial imf must have been very different from the present day imf , and been dominated by intermediate mass stars .",
    "these stars would have formed during the protogalactic phase , and could have destroyed significant amounts of primordial deuterium .",
    "typical stellar d / h depletion mechanisms usually predict the production of heavy elements in closed box models . indeed , by the time the metallicity reaches 0.1 solar abundance in a standard galactic evolution model , only a few percent of the initial d / h ratio has been affected .",
    "this is the main reason one is led to associate the observed d / h ratio to that of the primordial deuterium abundance .",
    "it is conceivable , however , that an early generation of stars was formed with masses only in the intermediate mass range of 2 - 8 @xmath45 .",
    "these stars would not be significant producers of heavy elements ( oxygen and above ) usually ascribed to type ii supernovae .",
    "motivation for this suggestion comes from the discovery by oppenheimer ( 2001 ) of a population of old white dwarfs in the halo of the galaxy ( see also ibata  etal 2000 ; chabrier 1999 ; gates & gyuk 2001 ) .",
    "previous studies of white dwarf halos have examined the consequences when the entire halo consists of white dwarfs .",
    "there are many objections to this extreme hypothesis , ranging from overproduction of he , excessive halo type ia supernova rates , excessive light element production in the early ( proto-)galaxy , and excessive c and n production .",
    "constraints on the high - redshift population , and possible observable signatures have been studied by several groups ( ryu , olive , & silk 1990 ; fields , freese & graff 2000 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the principal refinement we make to these ideas is to note that the old white dwarf halo population is sub - dominant , possibly amounting to as little as 2 percent of the dark halo . nevertheless , the effects on galactic chemical evolution are profound .    to see this , let consider the mass budget for deuterium destruction .",
    "in order to achieve noticeable d depletion , one must process a significant amount of material though an early generation of stars .",
    "a typical galaxy may have @xmath46 of visible baryons , mostly in the form of stars , and about @xmath47 total , the balance being dark matter .",
    "we point out that a white dwarf halo mass fraction of even 2% can have significant consequences for d destruction in protodisk and disk gas .",
    "this yields about @xmath48 in white dwarfs , and hence @xmath49 , comparable to the present disk mass , in precursor stars .",
    "all @xmath50 of the ejecta is totally astrated .",
    "hence present - day astration factors of 2 or more are easily achievable with a white dwarf halo mass fraction of 1% or less , in an interstellar medium containing some @xmath51 in atomic and molecular gas .",
    "the requirements of d astration and white dwarf production , all with little heavy element production , lead to very strong constraints on the required imf . to avoid heavy element production through type ii supernovae",
    ", we must demand that the imf is restricted to the 2 - 8 @xmath10 range ( adams & laughlin @xcite ) . at the @xmath52 end",
    ", the constraint is that too many stars would be luminous today or would have been seen as a huge population of red giants at @xmath53 , as @xmath54 gyr at this redshift in an @xmath55 and @xmath56 universe . on the @xmath57 end ,",
    "the problem is that we do not want to make a lot of metals ( oxygen and up ) from supernovae .",
    "this constraint is not as strong , and we need to add a few supernovae to get some metal production for the absorption systems .    a new result which independently demands an altered imf at high redshift comes from the far ir background . models of the firb ( by uligs at high z ) overproduce k light today ( ie too many low mass stars ) if a standard imf is adopted ( cole 2001 ) .",
    "an imf peaked at intermediate masses offers an attractive solution : it avoids the low mass stars and overproduction of heavy elements but gives the light .",
    "the firb requires @xmath58 to be about equal to what is produced with a standard imf for the optical / near - ir background , i.e. , about @xmath59 ( and to be produced in dust - shrouded uligs ; see , e.g. , hauser and dwek 2001 for a recent review ) .",
    "the white dwarfs that the uligs ( which are known to be merger - induced bursts of star formation ) produce would then ( possibly after another merger or if they formed in outflow - boosted star formation ) be the halo white dwarfs .",
    "the kinematics are a weak point but the moral is striking : a peaked imf may be needed for completely different reasons .",
    "the obvious objection is that the hypothesised precursor stars will overproduce c and possibly n that would be observable in galactic or extragalactic material ( e.g. , fields , freese , & graff 2000 ) .",
    "this is a serious issue due to the nature of the observed c and n abundances in primitive systems . for our purposes ,",
    "the most constraining c and n values are those in the same qso absorbers for which d has been detected .",
    "namely , c has been detected in the best - measured lyman limit systems ( burles & tytler @xcite ; omeara  @xcite ) , and in all three cases @xmath60 \\sim -2 $ ] , and @xmath61 \\la 0 $ ] or @xmath62 \\la 0 $ ] .",
    "results for n are similar .",
    "thus , the observations apparently demand that no significant c or n enrichment ( over that of @xmath23-elements ) takes place .",
    "these observations place key constraints on a putative intermediate - mass population iii .",
    "if the yields of zero - metallicity intermediate mass stars are comparable to those of their low - metallicity counterparts ( e.g. , van den hoek & groenewegen @xcite ) , then indeed , the resulting enrichment is extremely large if most of the baryons are processed through white dwarfs .",
    "although the enrichment is reduced when only a fraction of all baryons are processed , even here , to make a white dwarf halo at 10% of the total leads to c and n abundances at about @xmath63 = -1 $ ] .",
    "as this violates the observational constraints , we conclude that a halo white dwarf population can not be created at high redshift if @xmath0 intermediate - mass stars create significant c and n. it then also follows that the dispersion in d due to chemical evolution is small ; a similar conclusion was reached by prantzos & ishimaru @xcite .",
    "it is far from clear , however , that zero - metallicity intermediate - mass stars behave in this way .",
    "in fact , the nucleosynthetic yields for these stars are quite uncertain . in this mass range , at all metallicities ,",
    "the yields depend sensitively on the details of several `` dredge - up '' events in which convective mixing brings nuclear burning products up to the envelope of the star .",
    "these have been studied in detail for solar metallicity stars and for moderately metal - poor stars , and the main results of different groups are in reasonable qualitative and quantitative agreement .",
    "however , there remain basic qualitative uncertainties in the post - main sequence evolution of zero - metallicity intermediate - mass stars .",
    "specifically , it is as yet unclear  i.e .",
    ", model - dependent  whether the last and most important of these mixing events ( the `` third dredge - up '' ) occurs .",
    "there has been considerable effort recently to answer this question , but the studies have given conflicting results .",
    "chieffi , domnguez , limongi , & straniero ( 2001 ) do find such a phase , and conclude that zero - metallicity intermediate - mass stars should be important sources of c and n. the work of marigo , girardi , chiosi , & wood ( 2001 ) does not find a third dredge - up , but the authors are uncertain whether such a phase would have occurred had they run their models longer ; what _ is _ clear is that the c and n envelope abundances _ prior _ to this phase are small ( @xmath64 of solar ) and so would not create a significantly signature . finally ,",
    "fujimoto , ikeda , & iben ( 2000 ) argue that for stars with @xmath65 and @xmath66 \\la -5 $ ] , there is no third - dredge up at all .",
    "it thus appears that the question of c and n abundances in @xmath0 stars is both complex and unsettled . to simultaneously explain a halo white dwarf population and d depletion at high redshift",
    "requires that these stars do not eject significant c and n. for the moment , this amounts to an assumption , but one with some support from ongoing studies .    to make the proposed scenario concrete and quantitative ,",
    "we have constructed chemical evolution models which lead to significant d astration at low metallicity and also have significant white dwarf production .",
    "we will present one such model ; of course , given the freedom to adjust the imf ( and star formation history ) , a large class of models are allowed .",
    "however even with this freedom , the acceptable models share common traits and make similar predictions .",
    "we have explored the case of a closed - box model .",
    "the stellar creation or birth function @xmath67 encodes the rate and mass spectrum of new star birth via n_= c(m , t ) m t we adopt the `` bimodal '' form @xmath68 .",
    "we choose the star formation rate @xmath69 to be a short - lived burst of star formation with @xmath70 myr and @xmath71 , with an associated imf which is sharply peaked at intermediate mass stars ; this is the population which destroys deuterium and creates white dwarfs .",
    "following adams & laughlin @xcite , we take the imf to be lognormal _",
    "1(m ) m^-1 the model we present here has a characteristic mass scale @xmath72 and a dimensionless width @xmath73 ( this is very similar to a gaussian with mean @xmath74 and width @xmath75 ) .",
    "other parameter choices are possible ; for higher @xmath76 , the needed @xmath77 is narrower .",
    "the other term in the creation function describes standard , quiescent star formation .",
    "we have @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , and the factor @xmath80 allows for a smooth transition from the bursting to the quiescent star formation rate .",
    "the imf @xmath81 is a power law with slope 1.35 ( salpeter ) .",
    "results from the model appear in figure [ fig : bimodal ] . in panel",
    "( a ) we see the evolution of d / h versus metallicity [ o / h ] ( as o is an @xmath23-element which is co - produced with si , we take [ o / h ] = [ si / h ] ) .",
    "three models are plotted .",
    "the solid curve corresponds to a bimodal model in which we have taken a primordial value @xmath82 .",
    "the two phases of star formation are clear , as each leads to a characteristic drop in d , the burst phase acting at low metallicity and the quiescent phase acting at high metallicity .",
    "the points are the observed data discussed earlier .",
    "the values from quasar absorption line systems have an arrow indicating the si abundances are lower limits .",
    "the dashed curve in figure 1 corresponds to a bimodal model with @xmath83 . in this case , there is less astration needed at low metallicity , so the amount of gas processed in the pop iii burst is lower , i.e. , @xmath84 ( as is the resulting mass of halo white dwarfs ) .",
    "note that the two model curves join once the d has been destroyed in the pop iii phase , and follow the same quiescent evolution afterwards .",
    "we see that in both cases , the curves provide a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to use the existing d / h data and chemical evolution to accurately predict the primordial d / h value and hence @xmath4 . finally , the dot - dashed curve corresponds to a model in which there is no pop iii and a primordial value @xmath85 as in omeara et al .",
    "@xcite . in this `` standard '' case",
    "there is essentially no d depletion at low metallicity and , as we have noted , the dispersion in d is unexplained .",
    "the deaths of the pop iii intermediate - mass stars not only release d - free material , but also produce white dwarfs .",
    "this correlation is illustrated in figure [ fig : bimodal](b ) ; we plot the d abundance versus the total mass in compact remnants , essentially all of which is in white dwarfs .",
    "the model used here is that shown in the solid curve of figure 1(a ) .",
    "we see that the burst phase , during which d / h drops to about @xmath86 , puts about 15% of the baryons ( about @xmath87 ) into white dwarfs .",
    "the quiescent phase adds another @xmath88 .",
    "note well the distinction between this work and previous work .",
    "previous work was centered on the possibility of a white dwarf halo .",
    "here we are interested in d / h and producing a few white dwarfs .",
    "a halo population of a few percent would dramatically ease the previous constraints .",
    "indeed , figure 1(b ) shows that the 2.5% observation of oppenheimer is more than sufficient .",
    "note that by showing the extragalactic d _",
    "vs_.  si data on the same plot as the galactic points , we implicitly assume that the galaxy is a system representative of the quasar absorbers .",
    "it then would also follow that the white dwarf and carbon production also would apply to these systems . however , one need not take the model so literally as to demand that all baryonic matter  or even all the baryons in protogalaxies  follow this evolution .",
    "for example , in a hierarchical merging picture , one could instead imagine that this evolution is common to some but not all of the subsystems which form the galaxy .",
    "thus , d depletion ( and carbon and white dwarf production ) would be inhomogeneous within the protogalaxy , and across the observed quasar absorbers .",
    "figure [ fig : bimodal](c ) shows the predicted supernova rates , both for type ii as well as type ia events .",
    "the model use here is that shown in the solid curve of figure 1(a ) and in figure 2 .",
    "the type ii rate follows the assumed star formation rate , which has simply been taken to be @xmath89 and which turns on sequentially after the bursting pop iii star formation ends .",
    "the type ia rate is calculated using the prescription of matteucci & greggio ( 1986 ) , and assumes that the binarity properties of the pop iii stars are the same as those observed locally today .",
    "the type ia rate peaks sharply , echoing the rapid burst and small mass range that characterized the pop iii star formation . note that while the peaked nature of the ia rate is a generic feature of the model we propose , the peak redshift is model - dependent , reflecting the characterist mass ( and thus the lifetime ) of the pop iii stars .",
    "figure 1(c ) shows the results for a value @xmath90 , which gives a type ia peak at @xmath53 .",
    "had we chosen @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , we would find a peak at @xmath93 ( 2 ) . in any case",
    ", we predict that the type ia supernova rate is quite large at moderate redshift ; this can be tested in ongoing high-@xmath94 supernova searches .",
    "note that a suppression of type ia supernovae at low metallicities ( kobayashi @xcite ) , if real , could alter this prediction .",
    "a potential constraint on high - redshift type ia supernova activity also arises from the cosmic @xmath95-ray background at mev range .",
    "the dominant source of photons at these energies is mostly nuclear line emission due to the @xmath96 decay chain ( e.g. , ruiz - lapuente , cass , & vangioni - flam @xcite ) .",
    "the enhanced sn ia production of our model increases the mev background relative to the predictions expected from a constant - imf cosmic star formation rate . however , most of the contribution is at high redshift and is thereby diluted .",
    "in fact , the background is not a good discriminant of these epochs , and the type ia rate proposed here is non inconsistent with the cosmic mev background .",
    "the present work is motivated by the reports of a population of halo white dwarfs in our galaxy , and of dispersion in the high redshift d / h values . in light of these recent observations ,",
    "we have explored the consequences of a high redshift population of intermediate mass stars .",
    "this population leads to d destruction at low metallicity , as well as white dwarf production , and would add to the far - ir background without increasing the local near - ir background . for this scenario to remain viable ,",
    "it is necessary that the c and n yields of zero - metallicity stars are small , as suggested by some recent stellar evolution models .",
    "we have constructed relatively simple models which fit the data reasonably well for primordial abundances of d / h = 4 and 5 @xmath97 .",
    "other values are possible by merely adjusting the astration constant , @xmath98 , in the pop iii star formation rate .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is difficult to use existing data to accurately predict either the primordial abundance of d / h or @xmath4",
    ".    an interesting prediction of a halo in which the white dwarf number exceeds that in the disk by an order of magnitude is that , binarity fractions being comparable , the number of type ia would be greatly boosted in the very early universe . some may even be seen in the halos of nearby galaxies , ( smecker & wyse 1991 ) , though the spatial distribution of these events within galaxies will depend on the interplay between the formation and evolution of the pop iii stars and protogalaxies .",
    "a potentially disturbing complication is raised by the work of hansen ( 2001 ) , who estimates the white dwarf ages from their luminosity and color distribution .",
    "he finds that they are relatively young and if true , this is inconsistent with our proposal . on the other hand ,",
    "if the white dwarfs are real and in the halo , a young population is even more difficult to explain than an old one . given this , and the difficulty of the age calculations ( which also couple to the difficulty in determining yields accurately ) , we require that the pop iii white dwarf relics are old .",
    "however , further study of this issue is clearly warranted .",
    "the recently reported observations of an intrinsic dispersion in high - redshift d , taken together with the observation of a new galactic white dwarf population , demand a non - standard history of star formation and chemical evolution .",
    "if these observations persist , then an unconventional scenario of the kind we propose will be _",
    "required_. we note that standard scenarios of chemical evolution are unable to lead to significant dispersion at low metallicity .",
    "if these standard models prevail , then one must concur with pettini & bowen ( 2001 ) that the d dispersion at high redshift is an artifact , and that significant systematic errors are present . at present",
    ", the use of d / h as a precision baryometer must be called into question until these systematic errors are better understood .",
    "we expect that future analyses and observations will either show a convergence towards a unique observed d / h value , representative of the primordial one , or reveal the dependence of d / h on metallicity in high z absorbing clouds .",

    "<S> also , to avoid overproduction of c and n , it is required that the @xmath0 yields of these stars have low ( @xmath1 solar ) abundances as suggested by some recent calculations . under these assumptions , </S>",

    "<S> this scenario can be tested by observations of the cosmic supernova rate , and by confirmation and further studies of the putative white dwarf halo population . </S>"
