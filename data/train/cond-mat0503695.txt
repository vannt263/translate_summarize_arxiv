    "the subject of magnetic molecules has attracted much attention both for its scientific importance for studying fundamental issues in nanomagnetism as well as for potential applications . within each molecular unit",
    "are embedded a finite number of magnetic ions , coupled via heisenberg super - exchange interactions .",
    "furthermore , the intermolecular magnetic interactions are of dipolar origin and can usually be neglected . as a result ,",
    "measurements on crystalline samples reflect the magnetic properties of isolated individual molecules , with its most prominent feature , arising from the finite number of magnetic ions , being the appearance of a discrete magnetic energy level spectrum .",
    "this feature of the spectrum is reflected in the relaxational behavior which mainly arises from the interaction with environmental degrees of freedom , i.e. , a `` heat bath '' , such as phonons : the relaxation times of the dynamical magnetization can become very long even at moderately high temperatures . specifically , in molecules with a high spin ground state@xcite ( single molecule magnets ( smm s ) ) an anisotropy energy barrier is responsible for relaxation times as high as @xmath4 sec , whereas in some molecules with a low spin ground state , they are of the order of @xmath5 sec for @xmath6 k.@xcite the existence of long relaxation times becomes manifest through the appearance of dynamical hysteresis effects when using pulsed magnetic fields , and this is one of the most exciting phenomena observed in magnetic molecules . clearly , the hysteretic behavior is observable when the experimental time scale @xmath7 ( determined by the field sweep rate ) is in the regime of the spin - lattice relaxation times ( or shorter ) .",
    "this opportunity is available for magnetic molecules in conjunction with the current experimental capability of using strong magnetic fields with sweep rates as high as 1 tesla / ms.@xcite    another effect manifested in pulsed field measurements , is the appearance of abrupt magnetization steps at given fields.@xcite these steps are quantum - mechanical in origin and reveal the existence of small , off - diagonal terms in the spin hamiltonian which in turn give rise to avoided level crossings in the magnetic energy spectrum and to landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs)@xcite transitions . the origin of these interactions may be single - ion anisotropy or anisotropic exchange .",
    "the characteristic energy splitting @xmath8 of the lzs effect varies greatly among magnetic molecules . for istance , in smm s due to the large spin of the ground state , @xmath9 can be of order @xmath10 k ( as usual , @xmath11 stands for boltzmann s constant ) , whereas in molecules with low spin ground state , typically @xmath12 k.@xcite this implies that for currently available sweep rates one can probe the non - adiabatic regime in smms,@xcite whereas in molecules with low spin ground states we are already in the extreme adiabatic regime . experimentally , and for the molecules with low spin ground states , there have been observed deviations from the pure quantum - mechanical prediction regarding the height of the steps that have been associated with the role of dissipation whithin the lzs regime .    of particular interest",
    "is also another effect induced by dynamic fields , namely the appearance of small plateaus@xcite in @xmath13 following each magnetization step , thus giving rise to satellite peaks in @xmath14 .",
    "it has been first shown@xcite for the low temperature experiments on the magnetic molecule \\ { v@xmath15 } that the origin of these plateaus is the phonon bottleneck ( pb ) effect.@xcite numerically solving a quantum master equation that had been previously derived for static fields , saito and miyashita@xcite provided an alternative viewpoint of this effect , which they termed `` the magnetic foehn effect '' : they suggested that this behavior is widespread whether or not one is in the pb regime and that it is a consequence ( or an `` after - effect '' ) of the lzs transitions . as it turns out ( see sec .",
    "iv below ) , the pb effect can give rise to an enhancement of the foehn effect .",
    "this has been recently observed experimentally and will be reported elsewhere.@xcite    at present , a first - principles account of such relaxational phenomena in magnetic molecules induced by dynamical magnetic fields is lacking .",
    "our main goal is to show that one can generalize the conventional spin - lattice relaxation theory in the context of pulsed fields studies of magnetic molecules .",
    "the present work is devoted to ( and motivated by ) pulsed field studies of molecules with a low spin ground state : the simplicity of these systems , apart from providing a basis for better understanding the main physical ideas , allows one to directly compare the predictions of the generalized theory with experimental data .",
    "hence , these systems , when subject to pulsed fields , provide a convenient means for obtaining information on the various relaxational processes and microscopic interactions present in all nanomagnetic systems .",
    "one such system is the ( @xmath1 ) magnetic molecule \\{v@xmath2},@xcite which shows both pronounced hysteresis loops as well as nearly complete reversals of the magnetization at @xmath3 .",
    "the hysteresis loops have been accurately reproduced@xcite using a generalization of the standard@xcite bloch equation which in turn revealed that the one - phonon acoustic process is the dominant relaxation mechanism at low temperatures , and in addition provided an estimate of the spin - phonon coupling energy .",
    "the first - principles derivation of this equation is provided here within the more general context of our analysis . on the other hand , the abrupt magnetization reversals at @xmath3 were interpreted as the result of adiabatic lzs transitions originating from the existence of a small ( @xmath16 k ) intra - molecular , anisotropic exchange .",
    "the small deviation from the pure quantum - mechanical prediction of complete magnetization reversal was attributed to dissipation effects inside the lzs regime , but no quantitative account was given in ref . .",
    "this effect is also analysed in the present work .",
    "another class of molecules with low spin ground state where the generalized theory can be easily applied is that of the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ring systems at low @xmath17 .",
    "these are magnetic molecules comprising an even number of uniformly spaced metal ions arranged as a planar ring ( see for example refs . ) .",
    "the afm exchange interactions give rise , to a non - magnetic @xmath18 ground state , a first excited @xmath19 triplet state , etc .",
    "in addition to their hysteretic behavior , these systems can show several magnetization steps and sometimes the small magnetization plateaus mentioned above.@xcite as we show below , the present work accounts for these dynamical effects in a general way .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we develop the spin - lattice relaxation theory in pulsed fields for magnetic molecules with a spin @xmath0 ground state that is well separated from the excited levels .",
    "we arrive at a generalization of the standard master equations and show how these lead to the generalized bloch equation for the case of @xmath1 mentioned above . in sec .",
    "iii we extend this theory to include the general isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian where all energy levels are relevant .",
    "we apply this to afm rings at low @xmath17 and for fields around the first level - crossing field value , where they behave as two - level systems .",
    "we provide the treatment of dissipative lzs transitions in sec .",
    "this is done for the case of a level anti - crossing between two levels with different magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "we apply the resulting theory to the spin 1/2 case and that of afm rings at low @xmath17 , and demonstrate how this theory accounts for the deviation from the quantum - mechanical prediction for the magnetization steps as well as the formation of the plateaus mentioned above ( foehn effect ) . in this way ,",
    "in particular , we provide an explanation for the deviation from exact magnetization reversal observed in \\{v@xmath2}.@xcite we also indicate the role of the pb effect at low @xmath17 , and specifically how it can give rise to a pronounced foehn effect . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we provide a brief discussion and summary of the present work .",
    "we first consider a magnetic molecule with a ground state of definite total spin @xmath0 , well separated from the excited levels .",
    "( see ref . ) .",
    "] we assume that the temperature is low enough and the field regime covered is well below the lowest level - crossing field , so that we only need to consider the ground state spin @xmath0 level .",
    "we focus on the isotropic case i.e. , we do not consider non - diagonal terms in the spin hamiltonian .",
    "we employ the standard@xcite method of treating both the spin and the bath degrees of freedom quantum - mechanically .",
    "the hamiltonian of the combined system ( spin @xmath0 + heat bath ) is written as h(t)=h_s(t ) + h_b + v  , [ 10 ] where @xmath20 corresponds to the zeeman energy , @xmath21 is the bath hamiltonian , and @xmath22 is the spin - bath coupling . as usual , @xmath23 denotes the electronic gyromagnetic ratio . in our notation , @xmath24 has units of frequency and the spin operators are taken to be dimensionless .",
    "typical sweep forms are shown in figures below ; the experimental sweep time @xmath7 can be as short as 1 ms .    for our purposes",
    "it is unnecessary to specify the detailed form of the interaction @xmath22 , however , it can always be written in the general form v=_qa_q r_q  , [ 20 ] where @xmath25 are hermitian operators of the spin ( bath ) system .",
    "this coupling may , for example , originate from the modulation of the exchange coupling terms ( between the individual magnetic ions of the molecule ) or the modulation of the interaction of each individual ion with its local environment ( e.g. the crystal field ) which dynamically affects the spin degrees of freedom through the spin - orbit coupling.@xcite in both cases , the modulation originates from lattice deformations , i.e. , phonons .",
    "the terms bath and environmental degrees of freedom will be understood to mean phonons .",
    "the equation of motion for the density matrix @xmath26 of the combined system follows the von neumann equation@xcite _ tot(t)=-i[h(t)/,_tot(t ) ]  .",
    "[ 30 ] we switch to the interaction picture _",
    "tot = e^i(f(t)s_z+h_bt/ )  _ tot  e ^-i(f(t)s_z+h_bt/ )  , [ 40 ] where @xmath27 .",
    "the equation satisfied by @xmath28 is _",
    "tot(t)=-i[(t)/,_tot(t ) ]  , [ 50 ] where we have defined ( t)=_q _ q(t ) _",
    "q(t ) , [ 60 ] with @xmath29 , and similarly @xmath30 .",
    "now , all the relevant information about the spin system is contained in the so - called reduced density matrix @xmath31 , since for example = _",
    "s_b\\{_tot(t ) s_z}=_s\\{(t ) s_z }  , [ 70 ] where tr@xmath32 ( tr@xmath33 ) , denotes the partial trace over the spin ( bath ) degrees of freedom .",
    "thus we are mainly interested in finding an equation of motion for @xmath34 .",
    "we first make the assumption that the spin - bath coupling is sufficiently weak so that the born approximation can be used .",
    "furthermore , we consider temperatures high enough ( @xmath35 k ) so that the number of available phonon modes per spin is very large and as a result the phonons equilibrate _ independently _ from the spins",
    ". given this consideration and the expectation that the phonon relaxation times @xmath36 ( typically @xmath37 sec ) are much shorter than both the experimental time scale @xmath7 and the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath38 , the density matrix of the compined system ( spin system + bath ) can be factored as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 describes the stationary state of the heat bath at temperature @xmath17 . here @xmath41 denotes the bath partition function , and @xmath42 .",
    "the above factorization of the total density matrix is expected to break down at sufficiently low temperatures ( typically @xmath43 k ) where one expects the phonon bottleneck ( pb ) effect@xcite to take place . employing the above approximations , one arrives at the following integro - differential equation of motion for @xmath44,@xcite ( t)= _ 0^t du  _ b [ [ ( u),(u ) _",
    "b],(t ) ]  .",
    "[ 80 ] we denote the adiabatic eigenvalues of @xmath45 by @xmath46 , where @xmath47",
    ". the adiabatic excitation frequencies of @xmath45 are of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "now , for a given operator @xmath50 of the spin system it is very convenient to construct the so - called eigenoperator @xmath51 corresponding to a given excitation frequency @xmath52 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the kronecker delta symbol .",
    "these operators obey the equation a_q= _ a_q ,  , [ 100 ] where the sum extends over all possible integers @xmath55 .",
    "the reason for introducing the eigenoperators @xmath56 is that they take a very simple form in our interaction picture , namely _",
    "q,(t)=e^-if(t )  a_q ,  . [ 110 ] we note in particular that for a static external field @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and the phase factor in eq .",

    "q(0 ) )  , [ 130 ] are equilibrium time correlation functions of the bath , and the symbol _ h.c .",
    "_ denotes hermitian conjugate . as mentioned already ,",
    "this allows one to perform the following simplifications .",
    "first , we may extend the upper limit of integration in eq .",
    "( [ 120 ] ) to infinity .",
    "second , the variation of @xmath64 in the time scale of @xmath36 is extremely small ( since @xmath65 ) , so it is justified to perform the usual markov approximation,@xcite namely we replace @xmath64 by @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , the variation of @xmath67 in the time scale of @xmath36 is also small .",
    "therefore we may approximate @xmath67 by f(t - u)f(t)-u(t)=f(t)-uf(t )  , [ 140 ] i.e. , by a taylor expansion through first order in @xmath68 .",
    "the neglect of higher order terms is valid since @xmath69 , is equivalent to @xmath70 ( with @xmath36 taken as the maximum value of @xmath68 , and @xmath7 as a typical value of @xmath71 ) . substituting eq .",
    "( [ 140 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 120 ] ) , we obtain @xmath72 where we define the bath correlation functions , at the time - dependent frequency @xmath52 , as _",
    "qq(_(t))_0^du  e^i_(t )  u < _ q(u)_q(0)>_b . [ 160 ] we emphasize that the ` adiabatic ' @xmath52 factor in eq . ( [ 160 ] ) originates from the second term in the taylor expansion of @xmath67 and it has important implications in what follows . in particular , since @xmath52 is proportional to the instantaneous field @xmath73 , it will lead to an equation of motion with relaxation rates that depend explicitly on @xmath73 .",
    "we further adopt the so - called rotating wave approximation ( rwa):@xcite the relative rate of change of a typical phase factor of eq .",
    "( [ 150 ] ) , with @xmath74 is proportional to @xmath75 which is of order @xmath76 s@xmath77 ( for @xmath78 tesla ) .",
    "this implies that such non - secular terms `` oscillate '' very rapidly during the experimental time scale , and thus do not appreciably contribute to the dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ 150 ] ) . remains nonzero ; in the level - crossing regime , @xmath79 , the rwa is not strictly valid .",
    "however , the time interval @xmath80 over which the non - secular terms can not be neglected is extremely small compared to the experimental time scale : for @xmath81 ms one gets @xmath82 ms and therefore , given the much slower relaxation rates @xmath38 , the inclusion of these terms does not change anything in such a small time interval .",
    "hence , the rwa can be safely used for all fields , even the level - crossing regime . ]",
    "thus , by retaining only the terms with @xmath83 , we may replace eq .",

    "reviewing our derivation , the key assumption made is that the bath degrees of freedom equilibrate _",

    "the basis of this assumption is that the number of available environmental modes per spin is so large that the bath can be considered to be a large reservoir , hence allowing the neglect of any feedback from the spin dynamics .",

    "immediately after exiting the lzs regime , @xmath232 in contrast to the typical hysteretic behavior where @xmath195 lags behind @xmath109 . then , outside the lzs regime where , as explained above , @xmath195 tends towards @xmath109 , @xmath195 will decrease even though the field is swept towards larger values .",
    "this drop of @xmath195 eventually stops at a field @xmath194 , at the moment when @xmath195 equals @xmath109 .",

    "4 also suggest why a very steep minimum at @xmath194 ( pronounced foehn effect ) has not been reported so far in realistic situations . in principle , as mentioned above , the minimum at @xmath194 should become more steep at lower sweep rates . on the other hand , on decreasing the sweep rate ,",
    "one indirectly reduces the value of @xmath214 , is due to thermal dissipation before entering the lzs regime ( which determines the value of @xmath236 and consequently @xmath214 through eq .",
    "( 560 ) ) as well as inside the lzs regime ( shaded area in fig .",
    "4 ) . ] thus being closer to @xmath109 when exiting the lzs regime , and therefore compensating the effect of slowing down the sweep rate .",
    "ideally , for the realization of a very steep minimum at @xmath194 one needs ( for a fixed sweep rate ) , a relaxation process that is slow enough at negative fields ( i.e. , large @xmath236 and concequently large @xmath214 ) but becomes faster at positive fields , after exiting the lzs regime .",
    "such an `` asymmetry '' in the field dependence of @xmath111 can not exist unless we abandon our main assumption that the phonons are in equilibrium at all experimental times .",
    "this is because , according to our analysis , with the phonons being in equilibrium , @xmath111 depends on @xmath237 , and thus must be symmetric around @xmath234 .",
    "this raises the question whether the pb effect , which takes place at very low @xmath17 , could give rise to a pronounced foehn effect .",
    "this is indeed supported by the analysis of the pb effect described in ref .",
    ", for the magnetic molecule",
    "\\ { v@xmath15 } , which shows an asymmetry in the number of resonant phonons before entering and after exiting the lzs regime ( see , in particular , the inset of fig .",
    "2(b ) of ref . ) , as a result of the strong coupling of the phonons to the spin degrees of freedom . in short , the physical origin of this asymmetry",
    "is that @xmath234 is a level - crossing field for the energy spectrum of the spin system , whereas it corresponds to a `` reflection '' point for that of the resonant phonons : although , in general , when sweeping an external field one progressively brings the spin system into resonance with different phonon modes ( instantaneous resonance condition ) this is not true in the vicinity of a level anti - crossing , since when exiting the lzs regime the relaxation is driven by the same phonons that were in thermal contact with the spins while entering the lzs regime ( for more details , see refs . ) .",
    "the above enhancement of the foehn effect due to the pb effect has been in fact recently observed experimentally and will be reported elsewhere.@xcite     ground state , for fixed @xmath17 and for three different fields sweeps with constant sweep rates @xmath227 ( in arbritrary units ) .",
    "the shaded area denotes the lzs regime . because of the lzs effect , immediately after exiting the lzs regime ( shaded area ) @xmath232 , as opposed to a usual hysteresis situation .",
    "then , outside the lzs regime , where @xmath195 tends towards @xmath109 ( see text ) , @xmath195 drops even though the field increases ; a local minimum of @xmath195 is formed at a field @xmath194 at which @xmath238 .",

    "we have extended the standard spin - lattice relaxation theory , in the context of pulsed field studies of magnetic molecules .",
    "being easily applied to simple systems , this generalized theory can give important information on the underlying relaxation mechanisms and the microscopic interactions present in magnetic molecules in general .",
    "all the dynamical magnetization effects , including hysteresis loops , lzs transitions with or without dissipation and magnetization plateaus ( foehn effect ) , which are manifested in pulsed fields measurements , are accounted for by the comprehensive theory presented above .",
    "we first developed the theory for the isotropic case of molecules with a spin @xmath0 ground state well separated from the excited levels but also the general heisenberg model where all energy levels are relevant .",
    "we have shown , for two such simple cases , namely the spin @xmath1 case and that of afm ring systems at low @xmath17 , that the dynamical magnetization obeys a generalization of the standard bloch equation .",
    "in particular , this equation has been recently used@xcite for the magnetic molecule \\{v@xmath2 } , and was found to provide results in excellent agreement with experimental data at @xmath239 k , confirming that the dominant mechanism driving the relaxation is the one - phonon processes , and in addition providing an estimate of the spin - phonon coupling energy . obtaining this information",
    "was greatly facilitated by using a variety of field sweep forms .",
    "we also extended the theory to include small off - diagonal terms in the spin hamiltonian and thus take into account the combined effects of lzs and thermal transitions .",
    "this was done here for the large class of magnetic molecules with a low spin ground state . for these molecules , and for the currently available sweep rates ,",
    "one is in the extreme adiabatic regime .",
    "our main interest in these systems , has been the role of dissipation on the lzs steps , as well as the formation of small plateaus ( foehn effect ) formed after each step , observed in several magnetic molecules .",
    "interestingly enough , we arrived at a convenient set of equations where the effects of dissipation and lzs transitions can be treated separately .",
    "these equations account nicely for the description of both the magnetization steps and the plateaus .",
    "moreover , the role of temperature and the field sweep rate on these effects becomes transparent . finally ,",
    "although our analysis is limited to high enough temperatures ( @xmath240 k ) so that one can assume that the phonons are in equilibrium at all experimental times , it nevertheless indicates how an enhanced foehn effect could arise at lower @xmath17 , where the pb effect takes place .",
    "in such a case , steep extrema in the @xmath195 vs @xmath208 curves could be observed .",
    "the present theoretical work provides a first step towards exploiting the possibilities that are offered by probing magnetic molecules using external magnetic fields with high sweep rates .",
    "these probes , apart for providing information specific to magnetic molecules , offer the possibility of conducting a detailed study of the relaxational behavior of interacting spin systems as a result of their coupling with a `` heat bath '' and in particular the excitations of the host lattice .",
    "development of a broad theoretical framework for dealing with relaxational phenomena induced by dynamical magnetic fields is indeed a worthy goal .",

    "<S> we extend spin - lattice relaxation theory to incorporate the use of pulsed magnetic fields for probing the hysteresis effects and magnetization steps and plateaus exhibited , at low temperatures , by the dynamical magnetization of magnetic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> the main assumption made is that the lattice degrees of freedom equilibrate in times much shorter than both the experimental time scale ( determined by the sweep rate ) and the typical spin - lattice relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the isotropic case ( a magnetic molecule with a ground state of spin @xmath0 well separated from the excited levels and also the general isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian where all energy levels are relevant ) and then we include small off - diagonal terms in the spin hamiltonian to take into account the landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) effect . in the first case , and for an @xmath1 magnetic molecule </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at the generalized bloch equation recently used for the magnetic molecule \\{v@xmath2 } in phys . </S>",

    "<S> an analogous equation is derived for the magnetization , at low temperatures , of antiferromagnetic ring systems . </S>",
    "<S> the lzs effect is discussed for magnetic molecules with a low spin ground state , for which we arrive at a very convenient set of equations that take into account the combined effects of lzs and thermal transitions . in particular , these equations explain the deviation from exact magnetization reversal at @xmath3 observed in \\{v@xmath2}. they also account for the small magnetization plateaus ( `` magnetic foehn effect '' ) , following the lzs steps , that have been observed in several magnetic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the role of the phonon bottleneck effect at low temperatures and specifically we indicate how this can give rise to a pronounced foehn effect . </S>"
