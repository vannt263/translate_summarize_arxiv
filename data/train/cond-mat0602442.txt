    "the long wave vibrational properties of ( a , b)c semiconductor mixed crystals , where c denotes indifferently the anionic or the cationic species , are well - documented both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "this has lead to a crude classification of the phonon mode behavior of _ random _ mixed crystals in the raman or infrared ( ir ) spectra in two categories.@xmath5 most random mixed crystals exhibit the so - called 1-bond@xmath01-mode behavior .",
    "this corresponds to well - separated a ",
    "c and b  c transverse - longitudinal optical ( to  lo ) bands over the whole composition range .",
    "these degenerate into distinct ac : b ( b@xmath10 ) and bc : a ( a@xmath10 ) impurity modes , and have strengths that scale as the corresponding fractions of bonds in the crystal .",
    "the remaining random alloys exhibit the so - called 2-bond@xmath01-mode behavior , also referred to as the mixed - mode behavior .",
    "this corresponds to a single to ",
    "lo band with ( a  c , b ",
    "c)-mixed character .",
    "the frequency range that the band covers shifts continuously from one end member to the other when the alloy composition changes , and the strength remains approximately constant throughout the whole composition range . in mixed - mode mixed crystals",
    "the impurity modes are expected to fall within the optical bands of the host lattices , and thereby a common believe is that they should not be observed as distinct and separate modes.@xmath6    a rather crude criterion is that for 1-bond@xmath01-mode behavior the to - lo bands of the parent materials must not overlap . as a matter of fact",
    "the condition is too strong , but if overlap is large , the 2-bond@xmath01-mode behavior is always found .",
    "_ et al.__@xmath7 derived a more accurate criterion , even though simple , based on the coherent potential approximation .",
    "this is now the standard to decide about the 1-bond@xmath01-mode or mixed - mode behavior of the random mixed crystals . basically for 1-bond@xmath01-mode behavior",
    "the relative change in the reduced mass of the bond induced by the impurity must be greater than the difference between the limit dielectric constants of the host lattice , normalized to the sum .",
    "it is worth to notice that this criterion neglects disorder in the force constants , only mass disorder is taken into account .",
    "there would be only one fascinating exception that does not fit in the above classification of phonon mode behavior , i.e. ( ga , in)p.@xmath8 according to the elliott s criterion , random ( ga , in)p should exhibit a typical 1-bond@xmath01-mode behavior in the raman / ir spectra .",
    "_ emphasize that the larger the difference between the average mass of the substituting species on one side , and the mass on the unperturbed site on the other side , the more reliable their criterion .",
    "precisely this is true for ( ga , in)p as both in ( 4@xmath9 row in the periodic table ) and ga ( 3@xmath10 row ) are much heavier than p ( 2@xmath11 row ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the to  lo bands from pure inp ( 303345  @xmath2 ) and pure gap ( 368403  @xmath2 ) do not overlap .",
    "however , the 1-bond@xmath01-mode behavior does not show up in the raman / ir spectra .    in the following we propose a brief survey of the extended vibrational information available for random ( ga , in)p in the literature , and of the different models , for clear insight upon the puzzling phonon behavior of this alloy .",
    "we proceed chronologically , for more clarity .",
    "lucovsky _ _ et al.__@xmath12 have realized the first vibrational study of ( ga , in)p alloys , by using a combination of far - ir reflectance and raman scattering on polycrystalline samples .",
    "they observed a main to  lo band that behaved as expected in case of a mixed - mode behavior ( refer above ) .",
    "in addition a minor to - lo band was evidenced within the main to - lo band .",
    "surprisingly the minor lo mode shows up at lower frequency than the to counterpart , which discouraged an assignment of the minor to - lo band in terms of a zone - center signal .",
    "this was rather attributed to zone - edge modes .",
    "the authors concluded that ( ga , in)p was the first example of a mixed - mode behavior among * iii**v * s .",
    "the impurity modes were tentatively located at @xmath1330  @xmath2 ( gap : in ) and @xmath1390  @xmath2 ( inp : ga ) , i.e. within the optical bands of the host lattices .",
    "beserman _ _ et al.__@xmath13 have reported an exhaustive raman study of a large amount of polycrystalline ( ga , in)p alloys made of small pieces of single crystals .",
    "the whole composition range could be analyzed .",
    "both the to and lo modes were allowed in their scattering geometries .",
    "first , beserman _",
    "_ showed that the minor to  lo band persists all the way from the intermediate composition range down to both the ga- and in - dilute limits .",
    "in addition the authors could perform proper lo symmetry analysis by using a convenient piece of single crystal with small in content ( @xmath10.04 ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly the minor lo mode , localized at @xmath1390  @xmath2 , was found to be highly polarized , just as the main zone - center lo mode .",
    "the apparent zone - center 2-modes lo behavior at small in content was attributed to a splitting of the nominal zone - center lo mode due to coupling with two - phonon combinations from the zone - edge .",
    "besides , beserman _",
    "et al_. derived decisive information in the to symmetry , which we detail below [ refer to point ( i ) ] .",
    "jahne _ _ et al.__@xmath14 discussed the minor to - lo band as an individual zone - center response , which made it difficult to cover the mixed - mode behavior .",
    "for modeling of their ir spectra obtained with polycrystalline ( ga , in)p ingots , jahne _ et al .",
    "_ used a version of the cluster model originally developed by verleur and barker to account for the complex raman / ir spectra of ga(as , p)@xmath15 and cd(s , se)@xmath16 , that were attributed to local segregation effects . in this model the entire mixed crystal is built up from five basic units corresponding to the possible first - neighbor arrangements around the unperturbed site .",
    "basically the minor to ",
    "lo band would have its origin in the change of the ga ",
    "p force - constant from one type of basic unit to another .",
    "however , a model with potentially four oscillators per bond species in the alloy seems oversized to account for a single additional mode in the raman / ir spectra .    at this stage further discussion of the phonon mode behavior of",
    "( ga , in)p clearly required deeper insight upon the impurity modes .",
    "careful raman investigation of ( ga , in)p samples in the ga- and in - dilute limits was achieved by jusserand and slempkes@xmath17 ( js ) and kato _",
    "et al_.,@xmath18 respectively . for this purpose",
    "a new generation of samples with well - defined symmetry was used , i.e. ( ga , in)p samples grown as epitaxial layers or single crystals .    js did perform raman measurements with mostly in - rich ( ga , in)p epitaxial layers .",
    "they have used a standard backscattering geometry along the [ 001]-growth axis . with this geometry",
    "only the lo modes are allowed , the to modes are forbidden .",
    "js did observe the progressive emergence of the gap - like lo line on the high - frequency side of the dominant inp - like lo line from very low ga incorporation ( @xmath10.1% ) .",
    "the inp : ga impurity mode was accordingly identified as a distinct mode at @xmath12  @xmath2 above the inp lo mode , contrary to first expectations .",
    "interestingly , js noted that the in  p and ga ",
    "p lines exhibit similar strengths for as small ga incorporation as 1.5% .",
    "this was attributed to some coupling between the two lo modes , due to their vicinity . however , the discussion remained qualitative only , and the physical mechanism behind was not identified .    with the inp :",
    "ga impurity mode being out of the inp optical band , as for a typical 1-bond@xmath01-mode system , and the gap : in impurity mode being within the gap optical band , as for a mixed - mode system , a strong overlapping of the ga - p and in - p bands is expected in the alloy , resulting in a complicated phonon behavior .",
    "js@xmath17 proposed that ( ga , in)p is an exceptional alloy in the classification of phonon mode behavior .",
    "it would obey the so - called modified 2-mode behavior , with a dominant to mode at low - frequency that joins the inp ( 303  @xmath2 ) and gap ( 368  @xmath2 ) parent to modes , and a minor to mode at high - frequency that connects the inp : ga ( 347  @xmath2 ) and gap : in ( 390  @xmath2 ) impurity modes .",
    "kato _ _ et al.__@xmath18 performed a thorough raman study of ( ga , in)p single crystals and epitaxial layers covering the whole composition range , with special emphasis upon the ga - rich side . they could confirm the existence of a quasi - degenerate to - lo mode at @xmath1390  @xmath2 in the in - dilute limit , which at first sight supported the original assignment in terms of the gap : in impurity mode , and thereby the phonon picture proposed by js .",
    "interestingly , we note from their exhaustive data that the to mode at high - frequency , earlier referred to as the minor to mode , does not seem so ` minor ' .",
    "in particular close to the stoichiometry ( in@xmath10.5 ) the low- and high - frequency to modes have similar strengths ( refer to fig . 5 in ref .",
    "this has attracted little attention so far .    in the past decade",
    "most of the attention was focused on ga@xmath19in@xmath20p , abbreviated gainp@xmath3 for simplicity , which has become the leader material for the study of spontaneous ordering in semiconductor mixed crystals.@xmath8 precisely to close this brief overview we mention the reference first - principles calculations of the transverse phonon density of states ( dos ) in disordered gainp@xmath21 , recently performed by ozolin and zunger ( oz).@xmath22 a theoretical dielectric function @xmath23 was derived for pre - insight upon the to raman lineshapes , via @xmath24 .",
    "what emerged is that the dominant to mode around 330  @xmath2 involves both ga ",
    "p vibrations , as expected .",
    "our view is that such behavior is consistent with the mixed - mode description as well as with the modified 2-mode alternative , as proposed by lucovsky _",
    "et al_. and js , respectively .",
    "also , oz derived decisive insight upon the minor to mode , which is summarized below [ refer to point ( ii ) ] .",
    "following js the consensus so far is that random ( ga , in)p exhibits the modified 2-mode behavior in the raman / ir spectra , which contradicts the elliot s criterion . in addition the modified 2-mode picture fails to explain two key to features that have attracted little attention so far :    \\(i ) the dominant to mode exhibits a marked antagonist asymmetry on each side of the stoichiometry ( ga @xmath10.5 ) , as detected by beserman _",
    "et al . _ by using raman scattering ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "this was attributed to a fano interference with the disorder - induced combination of transverse ( ta ) and longitudinal ( la ) acoustical modes at the @xmath25 zone - edge , that was assumed to be at higher frequency than the zone - center to mode in pure inp , as opposed to gap .",
    "however , later measurements of the phonon dispersion in inp invalidate this mechanism .",
    "indeed the ta(@xmath25)+la(@xmath25 ) acoustical combination was found below the zone - center to mode in inp ( ref .",
    "14 ) , as in gap ( ref . 15 ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the minor to mode in disordered gainp@xmath3 has a gap - like character , as shown by oz in their first - principles calculations ( see fig .",
    "3-a in ref .",
    "this , in particular , is challenging for the modified 2-mode picture , as the latter implies a ( ga  p , in ",
    "p)-mixed character for both the dominant and the minor to modes , at any alloy composition .    in this work",
    "we investigate whether our 1-bond@xmath02-mode picture , earlier referred to as the ` percolation ' picture , may provide consistent understanding of the puzzling phonon behavior of ( ga , in)p , which is still lacking .",
    "this picture was originally developed for the long - wave phonons of ( zn , be)-chalcogenides,@xmath26 that opened the class of mixed crystals with contrast in the bond force constant , and has been extended recently to ( ga , in)as , with much success.@xmath27    the key issue when considering the physical properties of random ( a , b)c mixed crystals is how to handle the problem of alloy disorder . certainly the most convenient way is to describe the system in terms of the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) .",
    "accordingly each atom c from the unperturbed site is ideally surrounded by four virtual nearest neighbors , each of these consisting of a statistical average of the a and b substituting species depending on the alloy composition . this way perfect order is artificially re - built in the crystal , where it does not exist in reality , so that the approaches finalized at the microscopic scale for the basic understanding of the physical properties of the perfectly ordered parent compounds can be directly extended to the alloys .",
    "regarding vibrational properties , such an approach leads to the idea that each bond in the alloy should bring a single feature in the raman / ir spectra , as in the corresponding parent compound , but with characteristics ( strength , frequency ) depending on the alloy composition .",
    "this corresponds to a typical 1-bond@xmath01-mode behavior in the raman / ir spectra , as accounted for by the well - admitted modified - random - element - isodisplacement ( mrei ) model developed by chang and mitra,@xmath5 based on a vca description of the mixed crystals . provided some adjustment is made , this model also accounts for the mixed - mode behavior.@xmath6    while the vca seems actually relevant for the integral physical properties of semiconductors , that operate a natural average on alloy disorder , such as the band gap or the lattice constant , our view is that it should not apply to vibrational properties because these address directly the _ bond force constant _ , which is a local physical property .",
    "we claim that their basic understanding requires detailed insight upon the local neighborhood of the substituting species , which falls into the scope of the percolation site theory.@xmath28 essentially this is concerned with the statistical properties ( population , internal structure ,  ) of clusters formed by sites occupied at random on a regular lattice . while there is an obvious analogy between the topology of such systems and the topology of the random mixed crystals , we note that the concept of percolation remains basically outside the schemes used for the very basic understanding of the routine physical properties of mixed crystals .    in our 1-bond@xmath02-mode picture for the raman / ir spectra of the random ( a , b)c mixed crystals we describe these as true composite media made of two coexisting a - rich and b - rich regions , resulting from natural fluctuations in the alloy composition at the local scale . this way the alloy disorder is explicitly recognized , while it was totally eclipsed with the mrei - vca description .",
    "separate resolvable phonon modes are envisioned for each bond species , corresponding to the different force constants experienced in each of the a - rich and b - rich regions .",
    "in particular our phenomenological model envisages singularities in the bond force constant , and thereby in the phonon behavior , at the bond percolation thresholds .",
    "we remind that the bond percolation thresholds are the critical compositions corresponding to the first formations of pseudo - infinite chains of the b  c and a ",
    "c bonds in the a@xmath29b@xmath30c crystal . by using computer simulation based on random substitution on the ( a , b ) cfc sub - lattice ,",
    "these were estimated by stauffer as @xmath310.19 and @xmath320.81 , respectively.@xmath28 by crossing the percolation threshold the host region undergoes a dispersion@xmath33pseudocontinuum topological transition . as a matter of fact a singularity at the bond percolation threshold was clearly observed in the raman spectra of the reference ( zn , be)se ( see fig . 1 in ref . 16 ) and ( zn , be)te@xmath34 systems . the nature of the singularity is briefly discussed in sec .",
    "it was tentatively discussed in terms of the different internal structures of the dispersion and the pseudocontinuum , as predicted by the percolation site theory .",
    "detail is given in ref .",
    "it is worth to notice that a similar singularity at the bond percolation thresholds was also observed by bellaiche _ _",
    "et al.__@xmath35 in their first - principles calculations dedicated to another local physical property of random mixed crystals , i.e. the _ bond length_. there again the singularity was discussed in terms of a percolation behavior .",
    "the microscopic mechanism for the 1-bond@xmath02-mode behavior in the raman / ir spectra was previously identified as the difference in bond length due to the different local bond distortions according to whether the bonds belong to the randomly formed a - rich or b - rich regions.@xmath36 on this basis the larger the contrast between the bond lengths , the more clearly the 1-bond@xmath02-mode behavior is expected to show up in the raman / ir spectra . in fact the contrast is large for ( ga , in)p , as detailed below . at this stage ,",
    "let us emphasize that our 1-bond@xmath02-phonon picture can not be derived from the elliott s criterion because the latter considers mass disorder only , not disorder in the force constant.@xmath7    basically we expect two well - separated phonon branches for the ga - based bond and two tight ones for the in - based bond in ( ga , in)p , as for ( ga , in)as.@xmath27 actually ( ga , in)as can be used as a reference for the study of alloying effects on the phonon properties of ( ga , in)p , because the substituting species are the same , hence a similar contrast in the bond properties and thereby similar local bond distortions in the mixed crystals , with concomitant impact upon the phonon frequencies . while p has a smaller covalent radius ( 1.06  ) than as ( 1.20  ) , so that the p - based bonds are shorter / stiffer than the as - based ones , the contrasts between the bond lengths ( @xmath37 ) and the bond stiffness , best described by the ratio @xmath38 between the bond stretching ( @xmath39 ) and the bond bending ( @xmath40 ) force constants , remain similar in ( ga , in)as ( @xmath416.3% , @xmath4228.1% ) and ( ga , in)p ( @xmath417.1% , @xmath4234.3%),@xmath43 the ga - based bond being shorter / stiffer . besides",
    ", we have checked that ( ga , in)as is classified as a 1-bond@xmath01-mode system according to the elliott s criterion , as ( ga , in)p .",
    "we discuss the to modes mainly , because these consist of purely mechanical vibrations , i.e. quasi - independent oscillators , and thereby carry reliable strength / frequency information on each oscillator .",
    "we have shown in earlier work that proper investigation of the 1-bond@xmath02-mode behavior via the raw lo raman data is basically hopeless due to strong coupling between neighbor individual lo modes via their common long range polarization field @xmath44 .@xmath26 accordingly our lo study here entirely proceeds from the safe to modes .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we remind briefly the basis of our phenomenological 1-bond@xmath02-mode picture for contour modeling of the ( ga , in)p raman lineshapes , and we outline the ab initio calculations that we implement to support our corresponding re - assignment of the raman / ir features . in sec .",
    "iii our attention is focused on the phonon behavior of random ( ga , in)p . in sec .",
    "iii - a we re - assign the gap : in impurity mode below the gap to  lo optical band from careful re - examination of the raman / ir data in the literature , and propose on this basis a simple version of our 1-bond@xmath02-phonon picture that applies to random ( ga , in)p . in sec .",
    "b we perform ab initio calculations of the bond length distribution of the minority bond species in large ( ga , in)p supercells corresponding to alloy compositions close to the dilute limits and to the in  p",
    "( in @xmath10.19 ) and ga ",
    "p ( in @xmath10.81 ) bond percolation thresholds .",
    "we discriminate between connected and isolated bonds , not in the usual terms of next - nearest neighbors .",

    "p double - branches . in sec .",
    "iii - c we show that our model provides consistent understanding of the whole phonon behavior of random ( ga , in)p , as summarized in sec . i. in sec .",
    "iv we tackle the key issue of spontaneous ordering in gainp@xmath3 on this novel basis .",
    "we propose a possible mechanism that accounts for the disconcerting evolution of the raman / ir lineshapes with increasing ordering .",
    "conclusions are outlined in sec .",
    "first , we outline briefly , for more clarity , the technical aspects of our phenomenological 1-bond@xmath02-mode model for long wave phonons in random zincblende a@xmath29b@xmath30c mixed crystals . extensive detail is given elsewhere.@xmath26    we start with the frequency aspect .",
    "schematically , our view is that for each bond species the to response over the whole composition range consists of two quasi - parallel branches tied up to the corresponding parent and impurity modes at the two ends of the composition range , and separated by a characteristic finite frequency gap @xmath45 in the dilute limits .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , for a given bond species , the bonds are longer ( shorter ) within the host region that refers to the parent material with the smaller ( larger ) lattice constant .",
    "this was explained in detail elsewhere , based on first - principles bond length calculations in the two host regions.@xmath36 now , the shorter the bond length , the larger the bond force constant , and thereby the phonon frequency .",
    "accordingly within each double - branch the low ( high ) frequency branch refers to the host region with the parent material corresponding to the smaller ( larger ) lattice constant .",
    "now we come to the singularity in the bond force constant at the bond percolation thresholds , as mentioned in sec .",
    "i. basically , for each individual to branch the model envisages two different regimes on each side of the bond percolation threshold to which the host region refers : one in which the optical mode of the most dilute substitutional species vibrates with a frequency that is basically independent on its concentration ( regime 1 ) , and one in which the frequency of the same mode depends smoothly on the alloy composition according to a traditional but ` rescaled ' modified - random - element - isodisplacement ( mrei ) description ( regime 2 ) .",
    "we turn next to the strength aspect .",
    "a very general trend is that the oscillator strengths and faust - henry coefficients from the overall a  c and b ",
    "c signals in the raman / ir spectra do scale as the fraction of the related oscillators in the a@xmath29b@xmath30c alloy , i.e. as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively.@xmath5 these are referred to as the global weighting factors .",
    "now , simple symmetry considerations guarantee that in case of random substitution the scattering volumes from the a - rich and b - rich regions scale as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "these are referred to as the individual weighting factors .",
    "they fix the sharing of the available oscillator strength and faust - henry coefficient within each double - branch",
    ". eventually the multiplication of the global and individual weighting factors determines the relative strength of the four to modes ( 2 ac - like and 2 bc - like ) in the raman / ir spectra .",
    "once the two double - branches are properly set , full contour modeling of the multi - phonon raman lineshapes is eventually achieved on the above frequency / strength basis , while using no adjustable parameter , by using the generic equation @xmath48 ^{2 } + \\sum\\limits_{p}\\!c_{p}^{2}\\,\\frac{k_{p}^{2}\\,l'_{p } } { 4\\pi z_{p}^{2 } }   \\right\\ } .\\ ] ]    the to modes are obtained from the imaginary part of the second term , while the full expression provides the lo modes .",
    "here , the summation runs over the relevant number of oscillators , that may be smaller than four , depending on the alloy ( see sec .",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined on a per - oscillator basis and are , respectively , the faust - henry coefficient of the @xmath52-mode , its to frequency squared , and its related lorentzian responses .",
    "@xmath53 is defined according to the standard mrei notations;@xmath5 it relates to the oscillator strength @xmath54 , and thereby to the ( to - lo)@xmath55-splitting . @xmath54 and @xmath49 are normalized to the fraction of @xmath52-oscillators in the crystal with respect to the corresponding parent values .",
    "@xmath56 is the relative dielectric function of the mixed crystal in a form generalized to multi - oscillators , as established according to the standard mrei scheme .    in our model ,",
    "once the to phonon double - branches of the ga ",
    "p bonds are properly set , the raman / ir lineshapes are entirely determined .",
    "each double - branch is fixed by two parameters only on top of the frequency of the parent to mode , i.e. , the magnitude of the phonon splitting @xmath45 , and the frequency of the impurity mode .",
    "for clear insight upon these two key parameters in ( ga , in)p we determine a representative distribution of bond lengths , that we have done in a first - principles supercell calculation .",
    "we applied the calculation method and the computer code siesta,@xmath57 and allowed full relaxation ( of lattice parameters along with internal coordinates ) in a prototype ` percolation - threshold ' supercell similar to that used in ref .",
    "21 , along with ` dilute limit ' supercells .",
    "we used the local density approximation throughout .",
    "if comparing with previous calculations for the ( ga , in)p system , by oz@xmath22 , we used the same type of norm conserving pseudopotentials ( constructed along the troullier - martins scheme , see ref .",
    "25 ) , as oz , specifically using the following configurations and pseudoization radii ( in brackets , in bohr ) : ga 4@xmath58(2.00 ) 4@xmath59(2.00 ) 3@xmath60(1.78 ) , in 5@xmath58(2.19 ) 5@xmath61(2.48 ) 4@xmath60(1.68 ) , p 3@xmath62(1.83 ) 3@xmath63(1.83 ) 3@xmath64(1.83 )",
    ". however , we used a different basis set ( localized atom - centered functions , vs. planewaves as by oz ) , and larger supercells ( of 64 atoms , vs. a maximum of 16 by oz ) . generally , care must be taken that our bond length calculations are strictly valid only at zero temperature , which might generate slight discrepancy with respect to room temperature , of present interest here .",
    "according to the general criterion of localization derived by anderson,@xmath65 the condition for clear observation of the 1-bond@xmath02-phonon behavior in the raman / ir spectra of random ( ga , in)p is that the ga - rich and in - rich environments generate fluctuations in the to frequency that are typically larger than the reference to dispersion in the parent material .",
    "precisely the to mode in gap is nearly dispersionless , with a difference between the frequencies of the zone - center and zone - edge ( @xmath25 ) to modes of @xmath11.5  @xmath2 ( ref .",
    "this brings a much favorable context for the observation of a 1-bond@xmath02-phonon behavior in the ga - p spectral range .",
    "in contrast the same frequency difference is rather large in inp , of @xmath120  @xmath2 ( ref .",
    "actual phonon localization in the in ",
    "p spectral range would require extremely large fluctuations in the to frequency , and thereby in the in - p bond length .",
    "however , by analogy with ( ga , in)as@xmath27 this is rather unlikely .    on the above basis we are lead to describe random ( ga , in)p as a three - oscillator [ 1(in  p ) , 2(ga ",
    "p ) ] phonon system , in a first approximation .",
    "we propose the 1-bond@xmath02-mode to picture outlined in fig . 1 for the random ga@xmath30in@xmath29p alloy ( thick lines ) , from careful re - examination of the available raman / ir data in the literature ; details are given below .",
