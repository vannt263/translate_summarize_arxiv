    "in dynamical systems a bifurcation structure is a change of qualitative behavior when control parameters are varied .",
    "recently , a plethora of bifurcation structures is being reported in many types of discrete- and continuous - time nonlinear dynamical systems , when two or more control parameters are varied @xcite . in such works and references",
    "therein a common feature observed in the parameter - planes is the occurrence of isoperiodic stable structures , often namely _",
    "shrimp_-shaped domains ( ssd s ) , with a variety of bifurcation cascades and organization rules . in the last years , many works @xcite use numerical continuation methods to unveil in more details the bifurcation structures in the parameter - planes of low order dissipative systems .",
    "in particular , the authors of a recent letter @xcite use numerical continuation techniques to study in details a periodic domain in the biparametric - space of the two - dimensional hnon map . in that work , the authors claimed that using continuation methods is more feasible to analyze the delicate bifurcation structures for both nonlinear differential equations and maps , than use shooting methods .    regarding the chua circuit model @xcite , a paradigm of chaotic behavior , in the last four decades an enormous quantity of published papers report the rich dynamics that this circuit presents .",
    "the canonical chua model consists of three coupled first - order ordinary differential equations with a piecewise linear function .",
    "other smooth nonlinear functions are also used @xcite . in all these three - dimensional chua models the bifurcation structures in the parameter - planes present different types of roles and organizations .",
    "based on the canonical three - dimensional chua model , high - dimensional versions can be constructed introducing feedback controllers @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , adding another variables in the model . in this configuration , the high - dimensional model can present more complex dynamics , as hyperchaos @xcite .",
    "our main goal in this letter is to apply numerical continuation methods @xcite in addition with numerical solution methods to unveil the bifurcation structures in two - dimensional parameter - spaces , and the endoskeletons of ssd s , in a high - dimensional continuous - time nonlinear model . in this work",
    "we show that the endoskeleton of a ssd is formed by four main bifurcation curves : two saddle - node curves with one cusp point and two intersected period - doubling curves .",
    "these four curves delimit the lowest - period of the structure .",
    "another remarkable observation is the presence of transient chaos in the two - dimensional parameter - spaces of the model . as far as we know , the work here reported is one of the first to combine both numerical continuation and numerical solution methods in high - dimensional continuous - time nonlinear model to discuss the bifurcation structures presented by the model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ mod ] we present the model with a brief description of the employed methods . in section [ res ]",
    "we present the numerical results with some discussions , and in section [ conc ] we present the conclusions of this work .",
    "the nonlinear model studied has the origin in the canonical three - dimensional three - parameters chua model with cubic nonlinearity , adding a controller variable @xmath1 and a fourth parameter @xmath2 as proposed in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear equations are @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath1 are the variables , that represent the voltages in the real circuit @xcite , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath2 are the parameters , related to combinations of resistors and capacitors in the real circuit .",
    "such system is a four - parameter model and the parameter @xmath2 controls the extra - dimension , once that if @xmath2 vanish , the last differential equation of the system  ( [ chua4d ] ) vanish , too . therefore ,",
    "if we initialize the system  ( [ chua4d ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath10 , we will have the canonical three - dimensional chua system , as reported in the refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is well known that for a four - dimensional system , the lyapunov spectrum has four values of exponent , @xmath11 , one value for each direction of the flow . here , we use the largest exponent of the spectrum to study in the parameter - spaces ( henceforth lyapunov diagrams ) the behaviors of the system  ( [ chua4d ] ) identifying colors to the exponent values . for this purpose , the four - dimensional lyapunov diagram , @xmath12 , is sliced in the following parameter combinations : @xmath13 with @xmath9 and @xmath2 fixed , @xmath14 with @xmath8 and @xmath2 fixed , @xmath15 with @xmath7 and @xmath2 fixed , @xmath16 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 fixed , @xmath17 with @xmath7 and @xmath9 fixed , and @xmath18 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 fixed . to obtain the lyapunov spectra , the model is numerically solved by the runge - kutta method with fixed time step equal to @xmath19 and @xmath20 integrated steps to obtain the exponent spectrum via the algorithm proposed in @xcite for each parameter pair discretized in a grid of @xmath21 values .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath22 lyapunov exponent spectra for each parameter pair .    on the other hand , the bifurcation curves are obtained by continuation methods , using a properly continuation package for continuous - time systems , as matcont @xcite , which is a standard tool for numerical bifurcation analysis . here",
    "we superimpose the bifurcation curves of hopf , saddle - node , and period - doubling on the lyapunov diagrams to unveil some bifurcation structures presented by the system  ( [ chua4d ] ) in the parameter - space .",
    "the parameter - space of periods ( henceforth isoperiodic diagrams ) , is used to corroborate the period - doubling and saddle - node bifurcation structures presented by the system  ( [ chua4d ] ) .",
    "the periods are obtained by the maxima of the time - series for a given set of parameters , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite . to evaluate the period we use the runge - kutta method with variable time step , removing a transient time equal to @xmath23 and using more @xmath24 iterations to find the period with a precision of @xmath25 .",

    "the largest value of the lyapunov spectrum is codified in colors following the color bars at the right side .",
    "white , black and yellow / red regions in the diagrams refer to the equilibrium points , periodic points , and chaotic behaviors of system  ( [ chua4d ] ) , respectively . in these diagrams , an abundant presence of periodic structures ( black regions ) immersed in chaotic regions ( yellow / red regions )",
    "can be observed , as well as large regions of equilibrium points ( white regions ) .",
    "some periodic structures observed in fig .  [ fig1 ] are reported in others works for different types of systems , indicating that these structures are general , moreover , these structures are organized in specific directions on the lyapunov diagrams .",
    "some of these structures are known by ssd s @xcite . in ( b ) and ( e ) the hopf , period - doubling , and saddle - node curves , blue , green , and cyan lines , respectively , are superimposed .",
