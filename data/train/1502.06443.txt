    "singular phase diagram behavior as a function of spatial dimensionality @xmath4 compounds the interest and challenge of the phase transitions problems , as effectively pausing the `` phase transition of phase transitions '' problem .",
    "most visible are the lower - critical dimensions , which are the spatial dimensional thresholds for different types of orderings .",
    "for example , the lower - critical threshold for ferromagnetic ordering in magnetic systems is @xmath5 for one - component ( ising ) spins and @xmath6 for spins with more than one component .",
    "similarly , the lower - critical dimensions for ferromagnetic ordering under quenched random fields @xcite are respectively @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for one - component spins and for spins with more than one component .    a very recent experimental study @xcite on ge : mn films has shown the spin - glass lower - critical temperature to be @xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier theoretical result of @xmath9 from replica symmetry - breaking mean - field theory.@xcite a numerical fit to the spin - glass critical temperatures for integer dimensions has also suggestted @xmath9.@xcite other theoretical work have claimed @xmath7 from earlier ordered - phase stability studies @xcite , @xmath8 from transfer - matrix studies @xcite , and more recently @xmath6 from monte carlo @xcite and ground - state studies @xcite",
    ". renormalization - group work , on in effect two hierarchical lattices @xcite different from ours have earlier obtained @xmath8 and on a family of hierarchical lattices @xcite , again different from ours , find @xmath10 close to 2.5 .",
    "the lower - critical dimensions need not be integer , in view of physical systems on fractal / hierarchical lattices and algebraic manipulations that analytically continue .",
    "in fact , it would be highly interesting to find a lower - critical dimension that is neither an integer , nor a simple fraction .",
    "our current study indicates that this is in fact the case for the family of hierarchical lattices studied here , with @xmath11 .",
    "we obtain this result from a remarkably good fit to the renormalization - group runaway exponent @xmath3 from the numerically exact renormalization - group solution of a family of 23 hierarchical models with non - integer dimensions @xmath12 2.46 , 2.63 , 2.77 , 2.89 , 3.00 , 3.10 , 3.18 , 3.26 , 3.33 , 3.40 , 3.46 , 3.52 , 3.58 , 3.63 , 3.68 , 3.72 , 3.77 , 3.81 , 3.85 , 3.89 , 3.93 , 3.97 , 4.00 .",
    "our result is also consistent with the results that are graphically displayed in ref.@xcite for a family of hierarchical lattices .",
    "hierarchical models are constructed @xcite by imbedding a graph into a bond , as examplified in fig . 1 , and repeating this procedure by self - imbedding infinitely many times .",
    "this procedure can also be done on units with more than two external vertices , _",
    "e.g. _ , the layered sierpinski gasket in ref .",
    "when interacting systems are placed on hierarchical lattices , their renormalization - group solution proceeds in the reverse direction than the lattice build - up just described , each eliminated elementary graph generating a renormalized interaction strength for the ensuing elementary bond .",
    "hierarchical lattices were originally introduced @xcite as presenting exactly soluble models with renormalization - group recursion relations that are identical to those found in approximate position - space renormalization - group treatments of euclidian lattices @xcite , identifying the latter as physically realizable approximations . however , from the above , it is clear that any graph ( or graphs @xcite ) may be chosen in the self - imbedding procedure and one need not be faithful to any approximate renormalization - group solution .",
    "hierarchical lattices have been used to study a variety of spin - glass and other statistical mechanics problems.@xcite    the length rescaling factor @xmath13 in a hierarchical lattice is the number of bonds on the shortest distance between the external vertices of the elementary graph which is replaced by a single bond in one scale change .",
    "the volume rescaling factor @xmath14 is the number of bonds inside the elementary graph .",
    "from these two rescaling factors , the dimensionality @xmath4 is extracted , as exemplified in fig .",
    "1 . in our study , @xmath15 is used in order to treate the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations on equal footing .",
    "the lower - critical dimension of spin - glass systems is studied here by considering a systematic family of hierarchical lattices in all its possible decreasing dimensions .",
    "the ising spin - glass system is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 , at each site @xmath18 of a lattice the spin @xmath19 , and @xmath20 denotes that the sum runs over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites .",
    "the bond strengths @xmath21 are @xmath22 ( ferromagnetic ) with probability @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( antiferromagnetic ) with probability @xmath25 .",
    "parallel series of @xmath15 bonds .",
    "the dimension @xmath26 of each lattice is given .",
    "the renormalization - group solution consists in implementing this process in the reverse direction , for the derivation of the recursion relations of the local interactions .",
    "the lattices shown here and 19 other lattices with the nearby fractional dimensions are used in our calculations .",
    "( b ) the family of hierarchical lattices with @xmath27 parallel @xmath15 series of @xmath28 parallel bonds .",
    "the resulting hierarchical models are equivalent to the family in ( a ) with @xmath29 , with respect to identical critical exponents and phase diagram topology including the occurrence / nonoccurrence of a spin - glass phase . ]",

    "the starting bimodal quenched probability distribution of the interactions , characterized by @xmath25 and described above , is not conserved under rescaling .",
    "the renormalized quenched probability distribution of the interactions is obtained by the convolution @xcite @xmath40 } \\delta(j'_{i'j'}-r(\\left\\{j_{ij}\\right\\})),\\ ] ] where @xmath41 represents the decimation and bond moving given in eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) . for numerical practicality , the bond moving and decimation of eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 )",
    "are achieved by a sequence of pairwise combinations of interactions , each pairwise combination leading to an intermediate probability distribution resulting from a pairwise convolution as in eq.(4 ) .",
    "the probability distribution is represented by 200 histograms @xcite , which are apportioned in @xmath42 according to total probability weight .",
    "the histograms are distributed in the interval @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the average and standard deviation of the @xmath46 interactions , and similarly for the @xmath47 interactions .",
    "the different thermodynamic phases of the system are identified by the different asymptotic renormalization - group flows of the quenched probability distributions . for all renormalization - group flows , inside the phases and on the phase boundaries , eq.(4 ) is iterated until asymptotic behavior is reached .",
    "thus , we are able to calculate phase transition temperatures and , by linearization around the unstable asymptotic fixed distribution of the phase boundaries , critical exponents . similar previous studies , on other spin - glass systems , are in refs . @xcite .",
    "for our chosen sequence of hierarchical systems ( fig .",
    "1 ) , we have calculated , at antiferromagnetic bond concentration @xmath34 , the phase transition temperature @xmath48 where the renormalization - group flows bifurcate between the disordered - phase and the spin - glass - phase attractor sinks .",
    "the spin - glass sink is characterized by an interaction probability distribution @xmath49 that is symmetric in ferromagnetism - antiferromagnetism @xmath50 and that diverges in interaction absolute value : the average interaction strength @xmath51 across the system diverges as @xmath52 where @xmath32 is the number of renormalization - group iterations and @xmath53 is the runaway exponent .",
    "the spin - glass sink and simultaneously the spin - glass phase disappears when the runaway exponent @xmath3 reaches 0.@xcite the calculated spin - glass phase transition temperatures , critical and runaway exponents are given in fig .",
    "2 and in table i as a function of spatial dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the lattice with @xmath54 , not having a spin - glass phase , is below the lower - critical dimension .",
    "for the 22 other consecutive lattices with a spin - glass phase , we have chosen to fit the runaway exponent values , since they gives an excellent , near - linear fit with @xmath55 with an amazingly satisfactory correlation coefficient of @xmath56 .",
    "this fit gives , with a small extrapolation , @xmath37 for @xmath36 .",
    "note the near linearity , namely the smallness of the quadratic coefficient in eq .",
    "( in fact , a linear fit gives @xmath57 for @xmath58 , with a little less amazingly satisfactory correlation coefficient of @xmath59 . )    our calculated lower - critical dimension @xmath10 , where the spin - glass phase disappears at zero - temperature , is thus seen to be @xmath0 , for the sequence of hierarchical lattices studied here .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath10 is not an integer and not even a simple fraction , contrary previous examples of lower - critical dimensions ( and even contrary to upper - critical dimensions , where mean - field behavior sets in ) for other models .",
    "another important quantity is the critical exponent @xmath60 of the phase transition between the disordered and spin - glass phases .",
    "this exponent is calculated from the scaling behavior of small deviations of the average interaction strength from its fixed finite value at the unstable fixed distribution of the phase transition .",
    "the calculated critical exponents are also given in fig .",
    "as the spatial dimension is lowered , @xmath2 also approaches 0 . at the lower - critical dimension",
    ", @xmath2 reaches 0 .",
    "the disordered - spin - glass phase transition disappears at @xmath10 , where the spin - glass phase disappears .",
    "our family of hierarchical lattices ( fig .",
    "1 ) yields smooth and systematic behavior in all three quantities : the critical temperatures @xmath48 , the critical exponents @xmath61 , and , eminently fitably , the runaway exponents @xmath3 .",
    "all three quantities yield the lower - critical temperature of @xmath62 .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath10 is not an integer and not even a simple fraction , contrary previous examples of lower - critical dimensions ( and even contrary to upper - critical dimensions , where mean - field behavior sets in ) for other models .",
