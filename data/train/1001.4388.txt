    "brout - englert - higgs effect @xcite , which was also known as higgs effect , consists in that the gauge fields of an internal symmetry group acquires the mass when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the increasing of the number of polarizations is explained by that the gauge fields  eat  goldstone fields of the spontaneously broken gauge symmetry and incorporates their degrees of freedom as additional polarizations .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider , following @xcite , the following lagrangian @xmath2 for the gauge field @xmath3 and the scalars @xmath4 in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "if the potential @xmath5 forces the scalar field to have a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath6 , one can fix the ` preference gauge ' @xcite @xmath7 . in this gauge the kinetic term for the scalar field- goldstone fields for the spontaneously broken gauge symmetry-",
    "gives rise to the mass term of the gauge field , @xmath8 with @xmath9 , and the scalar field equations are reduced to @xmath10 .",
    "these equations are dependent : they can be also obtained as a selfconsistency conditions for the gauge field equations @xmath11 this fact reflects the pure gauge nature of the scalar field in ( [ lhiggs ] ) .",
    "_ general relativity _ is invariant under the spacetime",
    "_ diffeomorphisms _ ( general coordinate transformations ) @xmath12 and the graviton can be identified with the gauge field for the @xmath12 gauge symmetry .",
    "then it was natural to expect that the spontaneous breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry should result in that the graviton becomes massive , see @xcite and refs . in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the spontaneous breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry occurs in the presence of material objects : particles ( 0-branes ) , strings ( 1-branes ) , membranes ( 2-branes ) and p - branes with @xmath13 for higher dimensional cases @xmath14 . the corresponding spacetime higgs effect , its supersymmetric generalization and consequences were the subjects of study in @xcite and in @xcite ( where some statements of previous papers on brane degrees of freedom were refined / improved ) . this spacetime higgs effect manifests itself in the modification of the ` free ' einstein equations by the @xmath0-brane sources , _",
    "i.e. _ by the energy - momentum tensor localized on the @xmath0-brane worldvolume @xmath15 , @xmath16}|}\\,g^{[p+1]mn}(\\xi , \\vec{0 } ) \\delta_m^\\mu\\delta_n^\\nu \\delta^{(d - p-1)}(x^i)\\ ,    \\qquad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see below for the notation ) . however , although such an energy - momentum tensor is a counterpart of the mass term in ( [ df = ma ] ) , it can not be considered as a mass term for graviton but rather as a counterpart of the cosmological constant contribution to the graviton equation @xcite-@xcite",
    ".    the above statements of @xcite@xcite might seem to be in contradiction with @xcite and particularly with @xcite , where a model looking similar to brane interacting with gravity is discussed .",
    "the aims of the present contribution is to review the pure bosonic results of the study in @xcite@xcite and to point out the differences between gravity interacting with branes and the model considered in @xcite which result in different properties of spin @xmath17 fields in these dynamical systems .",
    "in the case of ( @xmath18-dimensional ) general relativity , the gauge symmetry is diffeomorphism symmetry @xmath19 and the gauge field can be identified with metric @xmath20 , @xmath21 material objects , @xmath0-branes ( particles for @xmath0=@xmath22 , strings for @xmath0=@xmath23 ) can be described by the coordinate functions @xmath24 defining parametrically their worldvolume @xmath15 as a surface in spacetime @xmath25 , @xmath26 their transformations under @xmath19 @xmath27 indicate their goldstone nature .",
    "this is not surprising as far as in flat spacetime ( superspace ) the @xmath0-branes break spontaneously the rigid translation symmetry of the bulk spacetime @xcite .    in the curved space of general relativity , when the metric is dynamical variable , the global translational invariance is substituted by local spacetime",
    "diffeomorphism invariance @xmath19 and @xmath28 becomes , roughly speaking , the goldstone fields for @xmath19 .",
    "as for any goldstone fields of the gauge symmetry , the degrees of freedom in coordinate functions can be gauged away ( but not to zero ) by imposing the ` static gauge ' conditions ( _ cf . _",
    "the ` preferable gauge ' @xmath29 above ) @xmath30 this is to say choose a local frame where @xmath31 looks locally as a flat hyperplane . in this gauge",
    "the @xmath0brane degrees of freedom are carried ( are eaten ) by the metric ( or vielbein ) gauge field .",
    "the action describing the interaction of the gauge and goldstone fields ( _ cf .",
    "_ ( [ lhiggs ] ) ) reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the standard ( @xmath18-dimensional ) einstein - hilbert action and @xmath34 is the @xmath0-brane action . in the simplest case of absence of the spacetime and worldvolume gauge fields ( bulk and worldvolume fluxes )",
    "this reads @xmath35 ( @xmath36 for the case of massive particle , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) . varying the action with respect to the spacetime metric we arrive at the einstein equation @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the energy momentum tensor @xmath42 having support on the @xmath0brane worldvolume @xmath15 ( [ winm ] )",
    ". varying ( [ seh+sp ] ) with respect to @xmath43 one obtains the so - called minimal surface equation ( @xmath44:=@xmath45 is the induced metric ) @xmath46 for p=0 case this can be written as the standard geodesic equation @xmath47 .    in the complete analogy with the internal gauge symmetry case , eq .",
    "( [ pgeod ] ) are dependent .",
    "indeed , as it is well known , the bianchi identities @xmath48}{}^\\sigma=0 $ ] for the riemann curvature tensor @xmath49 result in the covariant conservation of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor , @xmath50 . in our case",
    "this results in an equation with support on @xmath15 ; integrating it with a probe function one can show ( see @xcite for the bosonic string and @xcite for super@xmath0brane cases ) that this gives ( [ pgeod ] ) .",
    "this implies that one can fix the gauge ( [ hx = gauge ] ) and obtain the gauge fixed version of ( [ pgeod ] ) from the gauge fixed version of einstein equation , eq .",
    "( [ eieq = gauge ] ) which is eq .",
    "( [ eieq0 ] ) with @xmath51}|}\\,g^{[p+1]mn}(\\xi , \\vec{0 } ) \\delta_m^\\mu\\delta_n^\\nu \\delta^{(d - p-1)}(x^i)\\ , , \\qquad \\cases{m=0,1,\\ldots , p\\ ; , \\cr i = p+1 , \\ldots , ( d-1)\\ ; . } \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the @xmath0-brane source term given by energy momentum tensor ( [ tp - st ] ) in the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of the einstein equation ( [ eieq = gauge ] ) is the counterpart of the gauge field mass term in ( [ df = ma ] ) .",
    "however @xcite@xcite , this @xmath0-brane source term can not be considered as a mass term for graviton , but rather as a counterpart of the cosmological constant term which can not be identified with the graviton mass @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath0=@xmath18-@xmath23 case the @xmath53 term in the interacting action ( [ seh+sp ] ) , can be reduced ( by gauge fixing @xmath54 ) to cosmological constant term @xmath55    we have to stress that the notion of spacetime filling brane becomes nontrivial in the string / m - theory context ( the references can be found in @xcite@xcite ) in particular , because such branes ( _ e.g. _ d@xmath56branes of type iib string theory ) , are carriers of the gauge fields and fermionic goldstone fields corresponding to spontaneous breaking of bulk supersymmetry .    with this in mind , _ it is tempting to speculate on _ that this simple observation can be useful as a basis to resolve the _ cosmological constant problem_.",
    "namely , the small value of cosmological constant with respect to a straightforward qft estimation for vacuum energy , as well as the fact that its value is nonzero and positive while supersymmetry and supergravity prefer zero or negative cosmological constant , might be explained just by that the cosmological constant is determined by the tension of a spacetime filling brane , @xmath57 . however , developing such a conjecture goes beyond the score of this contribution .    a simple proof of that the cosmological constant can not be considered as graviton mass has been presented in @xcite .",
    "schematically , the arguments are as follows . in the case of small but non - vanishing cosmological constant , @xmath58 but @xmath59",
    ", one may consider decomposition over the flat spacetime @xmath60 of the einstein equation with cosmological constant , @xmath61 here @xmath62 contains the contributions of the first order in weak field @xmath63 and the terms of higher order in @xmath63 are denoted by @xmath64 ( the einstein tensor calculated with the flat metric vanishes @xmath65 ) .",
    "the first impression might be that @xmath66 provides the mass term for graviton @xmath67 .",
    "this , however , is not the case . indeed , if the first order approximation to eq .",
    "( [ eieq = h ] ) is given by @xmath68 then zero order approximation should be @xmath69 which implies the vanishing of the cosmological constant @xmath70 ( in contradiction with the original assumption ) .",
    "thus the selfconsistent weak field approximation to ( [ eieq = h ] ) with @xmath59 can be formulated only assuming that the cosmological constant is of the same order as @xmath63 , @xmath71 , so that the first order approximation is given by @xmath72 ; this equation does not contain mass term for @xmath63 .",
    "the deep reason beyod the fact that cosmological constant contribution to field equations can not be considered as a mass term is that the equation possesses the gauge symmetry with the same number of parameters as in the case of vanishing cosmological constant , and , hence , the graviton maintains the same number of polarizations @xmath73 ( which is @xmath17 for @xmath74 ) as in the case of massless spin 2 field .",
    "so the ads graviton is also massless ( like the minkowski one ) .    indeed , despite fixing the gauge ( [ hx = gauge ] ) , the functional ( [ scosm= ] ) and the corresponding @xmath75 interacting action ( [ seh+sp ] ) is invariant under the spacetime diffeomorphism symmetry @xmath76 .",
    "the reason for this is that the complete group of the gauge invariance of the interacting action ( [ seh+sp ] ) is the direct product @xmath77 of the spacetime and worldvolume diffeomorphism transformations .",
    "these correspond to the parametric functions @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ vdx= ] ) which can be used to fix ( on the worldvolume @xmath15 ) the gauge ( [ hx = gauge ] ) .",
    "this remains invariant under combined ( spacetime and worldvolume ) @xmath80 diffeomorphisms .    in the case of spacetime filling brane @xmath52",
    "this residual @xmath80 invariance is the spacetime diffeomorphism invariance @xmath81 of the einstein action with cosmological constant .",
    "then the number of polarization of graviton remains the same as in the case of absence of cosmological constants . in the case of not - spacetime  filling brane , @xmath82 , the gauge symmetry is reduced to @xmath80 , but only on the worldvolume @xmath15 , while outside @xmath15 the @xmath81 still acts on graviton .",
    "thus after gauge fixing graviton acquires some additional degrees of freedom ( counterparts of additional polarizations ) , but only on @xmath83 , the points of which for @xmath84 form the set of measure zero with respect to the set of all spacetime points .",
    "this is why one can not identify the @xmath0brane energy momentum tensor ( [ tp - st ] ) with a mass term for graviton .",
    "the above discussion allows us to understand the difference of the gravity plus brane system with the model for massive spin 2 fields proposed not so long ago by g. t hooft @xcite , @xmath85 although seemingly similar to the spacetime filling brane action ( ( [ sp= ] ) of ( [ seh+sp ] ) ) , the second term of ( [ sthooft= ] ) differs from that by that it involves not one but two spacetime metrics : @xmath86 and the constant @xmath87 used to contract the indices of the goldstone fields @xmath88 . as a result ,",
    "the ( spontaneous ) breaking of the diffeomorphism symmetry by the dynamical system described by the action ( [ sthooft= ] ) is complete , the gauge fixed action ( @xmath89 ) @xmath90 does not possess gauge symmetry and , hence , the model describes a massive spin 2 field @xcite .",
    "as far as the @xmath0-brane plus gravity interacting system described by eqs .",
    "( [ seh+sp ] ) and ( [ sp= ] ) ) is concerned , although the p - brane source terms play in it the same role as the mass terms of the gauge fields in the standard higgs effect , they can not be identified with the mass term , but rather with the counterpart of the cosmological constant term localized on the p - brane worldvolume @xcite@xcite .",
    "the cosmological term itself can be associated with a spacetime feeling brane ( @xmath91 ) and , as we have discussed above , can not be considered as a mass term .",
