    "the discovery of more than 70 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) by the egret @xmath0-ray detector ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) operating at @xmath4  mev gave a fresh perspective on the agn phenomenon , particularly relevant to understanding the intrinsic properties of their jets .",
    "egret - detected agns are typically radio - loud and show a second peak in their @xmath5 distribution at gev energies .",
    "blazars detected at tev energies have a primary peak at x - ray energies and a second component at tev energies .",
    "both types are @xmath6-ray blazars and the commonly - accepted model is that they have their jet oriented towards the observer revealing emission regions that are strongly doppler - boosted .",
    "relativistic boosting gives rise to large flux variations ( catanese et al .",
    "1997 ) and short time scale phenomena ( gaidos et al .",
    "two agns ( mrk  421 and mrk  501 ) show emission extending to energies greater than 10 tev ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999 ; krennrich et al .",
    "2001 ) .    since the discovery of tev @xmath0-rays from the blazars mrk  421 ( punch et al . 1992 ) and mrk  501 ( quinn et al . 1996 ) , these objects played a significant role in discussions involving the emission processes in agn jets and attenuation effects of tev @xmath0-rays propagating over extragalactic distances .",
    "both blazars exhibit episodes of strong flaring activity , providing good statistics for detailed measurements of their average energy spectra from 260  gev up 17  tev using ground - based @xmath0-ray telescopes .",
    "mrk  421 and mrk  501 are at approximately the same distance ( z=0.031 and z=0.034 , respectively ) .",
    "since the level of attenuation of @xmath0-rays by the diffuse extragalactic background light ( ebl ) via pair creation ( nikishov 1962 ; gould & schrder 1967 ; stecker , de jager & salamon 1992 ) depends on the distance of the source to the observer , it could cause a common spectral feature in the energy spectra of mrk  421 and mrk  501 .",
    "measurements by the whipple collaboration ( samuelson et al .",
    "1998 ; krennrich et al .",
    "2001 ) imply that the energy spectra of both mrk  501 and mrk  421 require a curved fit parametrization , e.g. , a power law with an exponential cutoff with cutoff energies of @xmath7  tev and @xmath8  tev ( `` stat '' means statistical error , `` syst '' means systematic error ) , respectively .",
    "data from the hegra collaboration suggest that the cutoff energy of mrk  501 is @xmath9  tev ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2001 ) and that mrk  421 has a cutoff energy of @xmath10  tev ( kohnle et al .",
    "the results from the two groups may be consistent given systematic uncertainties .",
    "the interpretation of the origin of the cutoff requires a better understanding of the emission process in @xmath6-ray blazars as a class of objects .",
    "making progress in unraveling the emission process in blazars from external attenuation effects requires two types of key observations .",
    "the first is contemporaneous multiwavelength observations at x - ray and tev energies ( see buckley et al .",
    "1996 ; krawczynski et al .",
    "these constrain the emission process by simultaneously probing the synchrotron emission and the mechanism responsible for the @xmath6-ray component , e.g. , the inverse compton scattering process ( maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ; marscher & travis 1996 ) . there are also competing models that assume that the high energy emission arises from protons ( mannheim 1998 ; mcke & protheroe 2001 ; aharonian 2000 ) .",
    "the second is the study of @xmath0-ray spectral variability as a function of flux and time .",
    "spectral variability is directly tied to the emission process at the source , whereas external absorption by the ebl is a universal feature that is independent of flux level .",
    "thus , by studying the spectral variability , we are able to disentangle these two effects . in synchrotron - compton models , spectral variability could be explained by cooling of electrons in the jet causing a shift of the break in the electron spectrum , or by variations of the maximum energy of accelerated electrons .",
    "spectral variability may also be a key to the understanding of the energy dissipation processes in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole powering the jet .",
    "some evidence for spectral variability has been reported by djannati - ata et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and krawczynski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for mrk  501 ; however , the effect was not highly statistically significant ( @xmath11  4 standard deviations ) and precluded detailed studies .",
    "in fact , the spectral index of mrk  501 turned out to be surprisingly stable during observations of a strong outburst in 1997 ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999 ) though the flux varied by a factor of 30 .",
    "in this paper we present the discovery of spectral variability of mrk  421 at tev energies based on data taken with the whipple observatory 10  m @xmath6-ray telescope .",
    "we show that mrk  421 exhibits a remarkable flux - spectral index correlation that appears to be stable averaged over time - scales of months to several years .",
    "the observations were made with the whipple observatory 10  m @xmath12-ray telescope using the granite - iii high - resolution camera ( finley et al .",
    "2001 ) . the high sensitivity of the telescope for point sources in the energy range from @xmath11  200  gev to greater than 20  tev permits the measurement of energy spectra of @xmath0-ray sources with fluxes above 1  crab on time - scales as short as 30  minutes ( 1  crab is defined as the differential flux of the crab nebula at 1  tev in @xmath13 ) .",
    "mrk  421 was more active in the 2000/2001 observing season than in previous years .",
    "unusually high flaring states ranging from 0.4 crab to 13  crab , lasting for a period of approximately five months , provided a wealth of statistics for studies of spectral variability .",
    "the data used for the analysis in this paper were collected on 2000 november 28 , december 4 - 6 , 22 , 27 , 28 - 29 and 2001 january 20 - 21 , 24 - 25 , 30 - 31 , february 1 - 3 , 19 , 27 - 29 , march 19 , 22 - 23 , 26 - 27 , 30 and april 13 .",
    "these data are an extension to the data set published in krennrich et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and include observations of the source in a lower flux state .",
    "a total of 49.93 hours of on - source observation time with zenith angles less than @xmath14 has been used in this study .",
    "the @xmath0-ray rate of the 107 individual on - source runs varies from 0.4 to 18.0  @xmath15 .",
    "the background from cosmic - ray induced showers has been estimated for each on - source run individually by using a matching off - source run also taken during the 2000/2001 season .",
    "a good match requires that both runs cover a similar zenith angle range , and that the on - source and off - source runs show good agreement in the distribution of the parameter associated with the alignment of the image in the focal plane , for values of the parameter outside the @xmath6-ray fiducial region . in some runs , a normalization factor between the on and off samples",
    "was applied to ensure that the off - samples accurately represented the background in the on - region .",
    "this procedure has been tested as a function of the total light intensity of the @xmath0-ray image to minimize a possible systematic bias .",
    "uncertainties in the spectral index , alpha , due to the method of background estimation are typically @xmath16 in the spectral index for individual runs and @xmath17 for sets of 5 or more runs .    in a search for yearly trends in a flux - spectral index correlation",
    "we also include previously published data from 1995 and 1996 ( krennrich et al .",
    "in addition we derive a spectrum for observations taken in may - june 1999 using the granite - iii 331-pixel camera ( krennrich et al . 1999b ; le bohec et al .",
    "2000 ; finley et al .",
    "the data consist of 33 on - source and 33 matched off - source runs from 1999 may 6 - 7 , 9 - 10 , 11 , 16 - 18 and 1999 june 5 - 8 .",
    "the analysis methods for the 2000/2001 observations , @xmath0-ray selection and energy estimate are based on the method described in mohanty et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and their application has been described in krennrich et al .",
    "these @xmath0-ray selection criteria are derived from parameter distributions of simulated @xmath0-ray showers as a function of their total light intensity in the camera .",
    "we set these criteria so that they retain 90% of @xmath0-ray images whose centroid is within @xmath18 from the center of the camera . to avoid the difficulties of modeling the trigger electronics we apply an additional cut requiring that a signal of at least 15.1 , 13.6 , and 12.1 photoelectrons are present in the three highest camera pixels , respectively . in this analysis",
    ", we have increased the lowest energy point of our spectral measurements from 260 gev to 380 gev , to minimize the systematic uncertainties inherent at low energies .",
    "the data were divided a priori into eight independent subsets with comparable numbers of excess events and average @xmath6-ray rates ranging from 3.3 to 16.0  @xmath15 . in figure  1",
    "we show the corresponding energy spectra . for clarity of presentation",
    "we have combined set ii and iii , and set vi and vii , respectively .",
    "progressive hardening of the spectra is apparent to the eye when comparing the spectra towards increasing flux levels .",
    "we have attempted to fit the individual spectra by a simple power law .",
    "these fits result in unacceptable goodness of fit ( @xmath19 ) values for sets i - iv , hence the power law hypothesis is rejected ( also see table 1 ) .    for comparison with previous papers ( krennrich et al .",
    "1999a ; krennrich et al .",
    "2001 ) and the results from other groups ( piron et al . 2001 ; bazer - bachi et al .",
    "2001 ) , we also fit the data using a parabolic function : @xmath20  @xmath21 .",
    "the results in table 2 have acceptable goodness of fit ( @xmath19 ) values",
    ". the spectrum hardens with increasing flux , whereas the curvature term shows no significant dependence on flux . in a previous paper ( krennrich et al .",
    "2001 ) describing the average energy spectrum of mrk  421 in a high flaring state in 2001 , the best fit to the energy spectrum was achieved by using a power law with an exponential cutoff .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath22 @xmath23    the results for fits of this form are provided in table  3 and exhibit acceptable goodness of fit values for all spectra .",
    "since the spectral index and cutoff energy @xmath24 are correlated , we also present the uncertainty of @xmath24 when accounting for this correlation as shown in parenthesis in table  3 .",
    "these uncertainties are the extrema of @xmath24 of the 1  @xmath25 error ellipse that result from plotting the minimizing function @xmath19 as a function of spectral index @xmath26 versus cutoff energy @xmath24 .",
    "figure 2 shows the derived cutoff energies for the individual data sets ( i - viii ) at different flux levels in units of crab .",
    "no evidence for variability in the cutoff energy is suggested by the data ( probability for the hypothesis of a fixed cutoff energy is @xmath27 ) .",
    "it is , however , important to realize that the statistical uncertainties in the cutoff energy are strongly correlated with the spectral index and the error bars on @xmath24 are typically of magnitude 1 - 3 tev .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude variability in the cutoff energy at the few tev level .",
    "instruments that extend to significantly lower energies and provide better sensitivity at higher energies are required to reduce the uncertainties in the cutoff energy .",
    "in addition , our measurement of the cutoff energy has systematic uncertainties , e.g. , the absolute energy scale , which can also be improved with the next generation of @xmath0-ray instruments , the veritas project ( weekes et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "hence , for the remainder of this paper we adopt a parametrization ( see equation 2 ) with a fixed cutoff energy of @xmath28 , the same cutoff energy that was derived for the average spectrum of mrk  421 in a high flaring state ( krennrich et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath29 @xmath23 with @xmath30    as can be seen from table 3 , the spectra corresponding to different flux levels are well fit by this parametrization , but show significant variation in the spectral index @xmath31 .",
    "we find that the energy spectra exhibit spectral variability from @xmath32 up to @xmath33 .",
    "the systematic uncertainties , which are indicated by the shaded areas in figure 1 , have been derived as in krennrich et al .",
    "( 2001 ) by varying cut efficiencies , the angular resolution cut and the software trigger threshold .",
    "in addition , uncertainties due to the method of background matching are included .",
    "other potential sources of systematic uncertainties such as throughput variations ( light throughput of the atmosphere , mirror reflectivity and gain variations of the telescope ) ( see lebohec & holder 2002 , in preparation ) , elevation dependence and varying signal - to - background ratio have been studied .",
    "no systematic dependence of the spectral index with these variables were found .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectral index as a function of the absolute @xmath6-ray flux in units of the crab .",
    "variability of the spectral index is apparent , and therefore the hypothesis that the spectral index is constant can be excluded at the @xmath34 level .",
    "the correlation between spectral index and flux indicates substantial spectral hardening with increasing flux .",
    "if we fit the spectral index as a function of flux @xmath35 in units of crab with a second order polynomial we get    @xmath36\\ :   - \\ :   0.0056 \\ : ( \\pm 0.00230 ) \\ : \\times \\ :    [ \\phi / crab]^2   $ ]    which provides a @xmath37 for 5 degrees of freedom ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "strong and extended flaring of mrk 421 allows us to study the spectral variability of this source as a function of flux .",
    "averaged over the time period 2000 november 28 to 2001 april 13 the data show a clear flux - spectral index correlation , with the spectral index varying between @xmath39 in a high state and @xmath40 in a low state .    whether or not this correlation is maintained in different epochs outside of the 2000/2001 observing period",
    "can be addressed using previously published results and archival data from the whipple collaboration .",
    "figure 3 also shows results from the average spectrum in 1995/1996 in a high state ( krennrich et al . 1999a ) and the average spectrum from 1999 may 6 through june 8 .",
    "the data points from 1995/1996 and from 1999 fall into place with the flux - spectral index correlation as observed for the 2000/2001 data alone .",
    "this indicates that the correlation between spectral index and flux holds true when averaging over time scales of months to five years .",
    "spectral hardening during flares has also been observed for mrk  421 in x - rays by fossati et al .",
    "( 2000 ) using bepposax data during x - ray flares in 1997 and 1998 . in x - rays ,",
    "the effect of spectral hardening has been interpreted as a shift of the synchrotron peak towards higher frequencies .",
    "the flux - spectral index correlation seen in the tev spectra could also be interpreted as a shift of the high energy peak towards higher frequencies .",
    "the shape of the spectrum  i in figure 1 suggests that the peak in @xmath5 is at a few hundred  gev , significantly above previous levels ( maraschi et al .",
    "the spectral hardening is most evident at energies below 2  tev ; it is not uniform .",
    "strong spectral hardening at lower energies might be expected in the inverse - compton ( ic ) scenario in which the ic peak shifts towards higher energies as the flux increases .",
    "conversely , at the higher energies , spectral softening occurs due to either a terminating particle distribution in energy , the falling cross - section due to the klein - nishina effect , or external attenuation effects from the ebl or nearby radiation fields .",
    "if the changes are due to a shifting ic peak energy , the flux value would be closely tied to the spectral index , as seen here .",
    "further studies of spectral variability on short time - scales ( hours - days ) will be presented in a follow - up paper .",
