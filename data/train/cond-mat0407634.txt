    "this can be explained using @xmath83 . although @xmath84 is larger for the first excited state than for the ground state , the first excited state has more negative interaction energy ( as its peak density is higher ) , thereby reducing @xmath54 below the ground state value .",

    "this parameter region is of interest for investigating tunnelling induced collapse , where one begins with a stable symmetric state and adds a potential gradient to induce a collapse in one well .",

    "4(a ) we plot the critical constant @xmath103 as a function of @xmath29 for the case of a symmetric double - well trap with @xmath51 for the ground and first excited states .",
    "we find that at a critical value of the barrier height , @xmath102 , there are two branches to the stability curve for the ground state .",

    "note also that @xmath93 reaches its maximum value at a height just above that corresponding to the appearance of the second branch .",
    "this maximum can be explained by a minimum in the peak density of the double - well configuration , which is plotted in fig .",
    "4(b ) . as the barrier is raised the condensate splits in two , thus reducing its maximum density .",
    "however , as the trap splits to form two separate condensates , the condensates in each well become compressed and the peak density increases again .",
    "our results remain qualitatively unchanged for different values of @xmath104 .",
    "this picture is similar to that of adhikari @xcite , except for the behaviour at large @xmath29 , where adhikari finds that @xmath93 increases again .",
    "as anticipated , we find that , for @xmath105 , when the system is essentially composed of two separate condensates , the value of @xmath93 in each well tends towards the value in a single harmonic trap containing the same number of atoms as each half of the double - well .",
    "finally , the critical constant @xmath93 as a function of @xmath29 , for the first excited state , @xmath106 ( crosses in fig .",
    "4(a ) ) first increases , reaches a peak value , and then decreases approaching the value for the symmetric ground state for large @xmath29 .",
    "this is expected , as in the limit of large @xmath29 , the density distributions of @xmath107 and @xmath106 become very similar .",
    "the main theme of this section is to investigate the possibility of observing a tunnelling induced collapse . at @xmath108",
    "we prepare a stable condensate in a symmetric double - well , for a value of the nonlinear constant @xmath88 in region i of fig .",
    "in order to induce a collapse , a potential gradient is applied at @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 for @xmath111 , such that the right well has higher potential energy than the left .",
    "subsequently , we study the dynamics leading to the onset of collapse , by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp3dhou ] ) numerically .",
    "note that this qualitative picture should remain correct , even if 3-body loss terms are included in the treatment , although the latter may affect the precise value for the onset of the collapse .     as a function of @xmath32 for a system initially prepared in state ( a ) @xmath56 and ( b ) @xmath57 ( black lines ) .",
    "the population difference for the eigenstates are also shown as solid grey lines .",
    "the vertical dashed lines mark the critical gradient at which the eigenstates become unstable ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively ) .",
    "the vertical dotted lines describe where the system collapses in the time - dependent simulation .",

    "the effect of the nonlinearity is that the ground state is immediately projected onto a superposition of states .",
    "as the potential gradient is increased , the population in one well reaches a critical value and a collapse occurs .",
    "the critical gradient corresponding to the collapse , shown by the dotted vertical line in fig .",
    "5 , is identified as the point where the interaction energy @xmath120 diverges , see fig .",
    "note that the critical value of the number asymmetry @xmath121 for which the time - dependent collapse occurs is close to the maximum value of @xmath115 found for the eigensolution ( grey horizontal line in fig .",
    "5(a ) ) .",
    "this prediction becomes clearer if we consider a condensate prepared in the first excited state @xmath57 , where the time evolution closely follows the eigensolution , see fig .",
    "5(b ) . in this case",
    "the collapse occurs at exactly the point where the number asymmetry exceeds @xmath115 , see inset of fig .",
    "the critical gradient at which the collapse is observed is found to be essentially independent of the rate @xmath117 at which the gradient is increased .",
    "one can also compare the critical number needed in one well before collapse occurs with the prediction for the symmetric potential shown in fig .",

    "the collapse occurs at @xmath136  s. the collapse is illustrated by the density plots shown in fig .",
    "we have confirmed that the collapse can be avoided if the potential gradient is ramped up to a value smaller than the critical gradient and then held constant .",
    "this would not hold if the system were very close to the critical region , in which case number fluctuations @xcite could enhance tunnelling and hence induce the collapse at a slightly smaller gradient than that predicted by our simple model .",
    "we have studied the stability of a low temperature atomic bec with attractive interactions in a 1d and 3d double - well potential .",
    "in particular we highlight a regime where the condensate is stable if the population in both wells are approximately equal , but becomes unstable if there is sufficient tunnelling from one well to the other .",
    "we study the dynamics of the system when driven by a time - dependent potential gradient and show that a collapse occurs at a critical gradient predicted by the time - independent solutions . although this picture is expected to be qualitatively correct in low temperature atomic condensates , further work is required to determine the precise details of the onset of collapse and the subsequent collapse dynamics , as well as the effects of fluctuations @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .",
