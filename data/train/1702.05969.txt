    "it has been twenty five years since the realization of the orbital angular momentum(oam ) around a phase singularity of optical field @xcite has been achieved . this extra degree of freedom of light , different from the well known spin angular momentum(sam ) , related to the polarization @xcite , is also termed as topological charge(tc ) of optical vortex that is created by dislocation of helical phase front .",
    "one of the examples of light with topological charge is the light with laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) laser modes . due to its unbounded quantum modes with oam",
    ", the lg beams have got enormous applications in fundamental studies of quantum system @xcite , optical communications @xcite , detection of spinning object @xcite , generation of second and higher harmonics @xcite , wave - mixing @xcite , generation of singular optical lattice @xcite .",
    "also in optical tweezers , it is a common practice to trap and rotate micro - size particles in the dark central region of this beam by transferring the oam of the field @xcite to the particles .",
    "similar mechanism has been used to create and manipulate vortex states in ultra - cold atoms , atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite where the oam and sam are considered decoupled under paraxial approximation .",
    "our recent works suggest that the oam of the field can contribute to internal transition of ultra - cold atoms @xcite only beyond the dipole approximation via quantized cm transition .",
    "recent experiments on single trapped ion @xcite lend support to the validity of this theory .",
    "multi charge vortices can be created in the bec when sam and oam are coupled @xcite as in the focused lg mode .    in all earlier formalisms for the treatment of interaction between an atom and lg beam",
    "it is assumed that both the size of the atom trap and the atomic cm wavefunction is small compared to the extent of the lg beam .",
    "so the gaussian factor defined by @xmath0 in the electric field amplitude ( discussed in theory section ) of the lg modes can be neglected .",
    "since it is the cm wave function not the electronic wave function which can sense variation of electric field of the lg beam , the oam associated with the gradient of electric field could not be transfered to electronic motion directly , but via quantized motion of the cm @xcite . here",
    "we address what would happen if we consider beyond such kind of linearisation of interaction hamiltonian when the radius of the rydberg atomic orbital is large enough to be no - negligible compared to that of the radius of lg beam .",
    "we consider that the characteristic length scale of trap is comparable to the beam waist , i.e. , the characteristic length scale of the lg modes . in this paper",
    ", we formulate the mechanism for interaction of the lg modes with cold - large - sized atoms , namely rydberg atoms .",
    "rydberg atoms themselves have some exotic properties @xcite and extremely large interaction strength .",
    "furthermore the detrimental effects of spontaneous emission can be avoided due to long lifetimes of rydberg states and so these states seem to be more suitable for application in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "multi - wave mixing through the highly excited states of trapped rydberg atoms is current interest for efficient electromagnetically induced transparency(eit ) @xcite .",
    "population dynamics in weakly excited clouds of cold rydberg atoms @xcite has been attracting a lot of research interest .",
    ". with increase of @xmath1 , field gradient in the central region of atom is decreasing .",
    "transverse dimension has been scaled with beam waist . ]    in the present work , we study the lg beam induced stimulated emission from the rydberg atom trapped in two dimensional harmonic potential . as is evident from figure [ fig:1 ]",
    ", atom can feel the variation of the field to large extent depending on its topological charge .",
    "we investigate the consequences of large size of the atom in a trap in the light - matter interaction . here",
    "the interaction is considered on - axis where the mathematical form of the electric field amplitude can be expressed easily with the wave function of the two dimensional harmonic oscillator in polar coordinate .",
    "we see that topological charge , which is the oam associated with helical phase gradient , can be transferred directly to the electron . as a result , otherwise weak transition channels , like @xmath2 , are accessible at dipole level .",
    "we will see that the gaussian variation of the beam profile , even at linear level , not only influence the rates of otherwise allowed transitions , but also generates extra transition channels leading to superposition of mixed parity final state by stimulated transitions .",
    "it will be therefore interesting to study how the rabi frequencies of various transitions change with the change of the topological charge of optical vortex .    in section ii of the paper",
    ", we develop the theory on the transfer mechanism of the oam in the interaction of the lg beam with rydberg atoms and find the matrix elements corresponding to dipole transitions .",
    "we analyze our calculated rabi frequencies in section iii with a discussion on the numerical methods adopted to calculate the electronic and the cm wave functions .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec iv with remarks on the prospect of this work .",
    "the expression of electric field @xmath3 for the lg beam , where @xmath4 is the frequency and @xmath5 is unit polarization vector of the beam and @xmath6 @xmath7 is the amplitude profile of the lg beam with the oam @xmath1 and can be expressed in cylindrical coordinate ( @xmath8 ) as @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 is the radius of the beam and @xmath10 with @xmath11 , c , @xmath12 are the intensity , velocity of light and electric permitivity of free space , respectively . in the case of on - axis interaction , we consider the origin of the coordinate system of the interaction being at the center of the beam . since , the trap size for the rydberg atom is comparable to the beam size , the gaussian factor , @xmath13 , can no longer be discarded , rather it will yield new effects in the light - matter interactions .    here",
    "atomic wavefunctions are considered in spherical coordinate system @xmath14 . to convert the beam profile in that coordinate system , we replace @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and",
    "then eq . becomes @xmath18 equation shows that both the phase gradients of optical field generated from the topological charge , @xmath1 , and gradient due to gaussian profile , @xmath19 , can be transferred to the internal and the cm motions of matter as external source of angular momentum .",
    "we have used relations of solid harmonics here as discussed in appendix a and obtain @xmath20    the interaction hamiltonian is given in power - zienau - wooley(pzw ) scheme @xcite as @xmath21 the polarization vector , @xmath22(*r * ) , in closed integral form is defined by @xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the masses of core of the atom and total atom , which are considered same due to smallness of mass of the electron . the relative coordinate ( internal coordinate ) of the electron w.r.t .",
    "the cm of atom is @xmath26 .",
    "as discussed in appendix b , the interaction hamiltonian can be reduced to @xmath27 where @xmath28    the last angular factor @xmath29 in eq .",
    "depends only on the electronic co - ordinate as the cm motion is considered to be confined in the plane transverse to the laser propagation direction .",
    "this angular factor can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics : @xmath30 with @xmath31 being spherical bessel function of order @xmath32 and @xmath33 is substituted by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "after the integration @xmath37 @xcite , the interaction hamiltonian takes the form :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 . here ,",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are the angular components of the interaction hamiltonian containing spherical harmonics involving the electron and the cm angular co - ordinates , respectively .",
    "@xmath44 is hypergeometric function . @xmath45 and @xmath46 are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath49 is considered to have dipole approximation , when the size of atom is much smaller than the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "therefore , for the rydberg atom , it appears that the dipole approximation breaks down .",
    "however , dipole approximation may hold good for rydberg atoms in case of photonization occurring in the vicinity of nucleus@xcite",
    ". corresponding transition matrix element ( putting @xmath49 in eq . ) between initial and final composite ( electronic plus cm ) states will be    @xmath50    here @xmath51 with @xmath52 is the width of the cm wavefunction , a characteristic length of trap .",
    "the last kronecker delta function in the above matrix element represents the angular part of the cm with @xmath53 and @xmath54 as initial and final angular momenta , respectively .",
    "it appears from the term @xmath42 that @xmath19 and @xmath1 have same characteristic signature which is associated with the phase gradient of wave front .",
    "the restrictions on the other parameters , like @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 decide the new selection rule of the electronic transitions . due to the appearance of both @xmath19 and @xmath58 as rank in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , as expected , the gaussian term of the field does not confer net angular momentum to the total matter system .",
    "however , the electron and the cm individually can gain am from the gt .",
    "the @xmath19 value indicates the order of @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the expansion of gaussian term of electric field .",
    "for example , @xmath61 designates the conventional consideration of the lg mode , like neglecting gt of the field in the @xmath62 case . here",
    "onward we consider @xmath63 as other terms involve successive power of @xmath64 and omitting them cause negligible error .",
    "the strengths of these transitions are determined by the power of the electronic and cm coordinates , @xmath65 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    in the case of normal atom ( atom appears point - like to beam ) ,",
    "the dipole transition is driven by oscillating electric field .",
    "however , quadrupole transition is held by oscillating field gradient which can even occur at null intensity region . since the former feature of the beam",
    "is not associated with the oam of the field and it is the latter which decides the value of this oam . for a point like atom , quadrupole transition is the lowest order transition where the external oam goes to electronic motion .",
    "but if an atom is large , the oam may be transferred to the electron even at dipole transition level with new selection rules .",
    "the dipole transition matrix element is @xmath66 since @xmath67 and minumum value of @xmath68 is @xmath69 , electron receives momentum from @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "it means , if component @xmath55 ( @xmath73 ) of oam goes to the internal motion , rest of the value of component goes to the cm .",
    "whereas , if the internal motion gains @xmath74 from gaussian term of the field , the cm gains @xmath75 units angular momentum .",
    "therefore , different channels of transition are possible even at dipole level .",
    "this leads to the violation of dipolar approximation as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the angular part of the electronic matrix element in eq.(9 ) indicates that an arbitrary amount of the optical oam can be transferred to the electron for various values of @xmath55 directly without any transfer to the cm motion .",
    "note that the typical value of @xmath76 is one order less than unity and the range of radial integral goes much beyond the characteristic size of the trap ; therefore , each transition matrix element carries appreciable amplitudes .",
    "interestingly , the strength of particular electronic transition is independent of sign of @xmath1 .",
    "this is because both the radial matrix elements of the electron and the cm depend on the power @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , which are independent of orientation of the oam of the beam .",
    "here the cm wave function , obtained by solving schrdinger equation of the rydberg atom in a two dimensional harmonic oscillatory potential is given by : @xmath77 where the normalized amplitude , in terms of the characteristic coordinate ( @xmath78 ) is well known as @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "n is the energy quantum number specifying the amount of vibrational energy with @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 gives amount of angular momentum quantum number .",
    "the radial wave function of the valance electron with reduced mass @xmath83 is given by @xcite    @xmath84 \\psi_e(r ) = e\\psi_e(r)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the potential @xmath85 here is a sum of three physical contributions : @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , with @xmath88 being the effective charge from the core electron and given by @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "@xmath90 is the potential due to core polarization on the valence ( rydberg ) electron with @xmath91 being amplitude of core polarisablity .",
    "the value of the parameters @xmath92 and @xmath91 can be found in standard literature@xcite .",
    "spin - orbit potential has well known form @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath45 is the fine structure constant and @xmath94 with @xmath95 , @xmath1 and @xmath96 being total angular momentum , orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum quantum number of electron , respectively .",
    "eq . has been solved by numerov algorithm @xcite to obtain the radial wave function .",
    "this numerical approach requires energy values of the orbitals as input .",
    "the energy values have been calculated using the quantum defect theory @xcite .    for our numerical illustration of our work",
    ", we choose realistic parameters following the experiment of austrian group@xcite . in this work , we have considered the lg beam with waist @xmath97 @xcite and intensity of @xmath98 which is below ionization limit @xcite of rubidium rydberg atom .",
    "the atom is trapped under two dimensional harmonic potential with characteristic length @xmath99@xcite in the state @xmath100 ( n=60 ) .",
    "further , first two terms ( corresponding to @xmath19= 0 and 1 ) have been kept in the expansion of gaussian factor ( see eq . ) of a left circularly polarized ( means @xmath101 ) lg beam to explore radial gradient of the field .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) state that beam parameters , the oam and the order of the gradient of field ( i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath58 ) , are shared between the motion of the electron and the cm .",
    "+ we discuss our results mainly for two cases .",
    "case - i : let us neglect the field gradient due to gaussian part of the beam ( i.e. @xmath61 ) and study the generation of various channels of electronic transition shown in table 1 . let the oam of beam be one unit ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "i ) in the case of beam with left circular polarization , i.e. @xmath102 , two possible sharing of oam of light can take place .",
    "first , the motion of electron may get zero or one unit contribution ( i.e. the case when @xmath103 or @xmath104 , respectively ) from it . as an initially prepared spin @xmath105 of electron is not modified by photon , the change of z - component of total angular momentum , @xmath106 leads to @xmath107 transition in the former case ( @xmath108 ) and the cm of atom gains one unit angular momentum ( @xmath109 )",
    ". please remember , the sign of @xmath55 will have sign of the oam of light .",
    "the latter case , i.e. , @xmath110 , corresponds to transition @xmath111 with no angular momentum getting transferred to cm ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "+ ii ) for right circularly polarized beam , i.e. @xmath113 , electronic transitions @xmath114 and @xmath115 are possible corresponding to @xmath55= 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "these transitions lead -1 and 0 as the values of oam transferred to the cm .",
    "similarly , for negative value of the oam of light , the cm of the atom acquires 1 or 0 or -1 for particular combination of polarization and @xmath55 as shown in table-1 .",
    "therefore , different electronic transition channels are coming up for different am of cm due to large extent of trapped atom .",
    "let us now turn our attention to case - ii . in this case , we study the first order kind of effect of gaussian part of the beam by considering @xmath116 ( i.e. , considering linear term of the gaussian exponent ) .",
    "like case - i , here we get many more channels of electronic transitions as discussed for eq . with different combinations of @xmath71 and @xmath117 .",
    "lets us focus here only one of the cases , say , @xmath62 and @xmath102 .",
    "parameters @xmath71 and @xmath117 contribute in the rabi frequency likewise @xmath70 . now ,",
    "if we consider total angular momentum of light goes to the motion of the cm ( i.e. @xmath118 ) , two possible transition are @xmath119 and @xmath120 . in the former case , one positive unit of oam",
    "is transferred to the electron and as a result the cm acquires one negative unit of oam which nullifies total oam of the cm .",
    "opposite effect will arise in the latter case where the cm will acquire positive unit of oam to have total oam equal to 2 .",
    "but , in both the cases transitions will be @xmath121 transition .",
    "now , the change @xmath122 will be decided from the value of @xmath123 , which generate @xmath124 in former case and @xmath125 for the latter .",
    "it is clear from the table ii , rabi frequency in the @xmath126 transition corresponding to @xmath127 is greater than that of @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , we can predict that the rabi frequencies for @xmath129 will be greater than that of @xmath130 when both the @xmath131 are negative .",
    "similarly , channels @xmath130 can be explored by making sign of @xmath132 and @xmath1 opposite .",
    "so , depending on the relative sign of @xmath133 and @xmath1 , most of the magnetic sub - levels in @xmath126 transitions@xcite , can be explored by lg beam in dipole level .",
    "it is possible to get @xmath134 by either choosing linear polarization or transfer of oam of light totally in the motion of the cm .",
    ".various possible final states depending on sign of topological charge and polarization neglecting gaussian contribution [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "here we have studied how spatial structure of vortex light couples to both internal electronic and external cm motion of trapped rydberg atom . we have treated the electronic and the cm coordinate on equal footings .",
    "dipole transition is only dominant transition for the rydberg atoms .",
    "the oam of field can be transferred directly to the electronic motion which modifies dipole selection rule opening up a plethora of transition channels with different rabi frequencies .",
    "distinct identification of these channels may be possible either by external magnetic field , or by lg beam induced magnetism @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that the large size of a rydberg atom and extended cm wavefunction leads to an appreciable effect of the gaussian term of the beam at the edge .",
    "this part of interaction will be significant and at par interaction with inherent vorticity of optical field .",
    "as the field oam is shared between the electron and the cm , an entanglement induced by the lg beam is inevitable between the combined final states of the electron and the cm generated form @xmath126 transition .",
    "another salient feature of this light matter interaction is generation of mixed parity state , i.e. @xmath135 .",
    "these mixing coefficients depend on the rabi frequencies which depend on the vortex charge of lg beam .",
    "the solid harmonics @xmath136 is defined by @xmath137 with @xmath138}$ ] .",
    "we can express the following factors in terms of solid harmonic @xcite . @xmath139 and @xmath140",
    "substituting eq . and eq . into , @xmath141 takes the form @xmath142    eq .",
    "( 3 ) and eq . ( 6 ) show that now we require solid harmonics of the form @xmath143 .",
    "additional theorems of regular solid harmonics can be used to separate internal and external coordinates as @xmath144    l allen , mw bejersbergen , rjcspreeuw and jp woerdman .",

    "<S> transfer mechanism of orbital angular moment ( oam ) of light to trapped ground state atom under paraxial approximation is well known . here </S>",
    "<S> theoretically we study the how optical oam can be transferred to trapped rydberg atoms in interaction with a laguerre - gaussian(lg ) beam . </S>",
    "<S> unlike that in ground state atoms , optical oam from the lg beam is shown to be transferable to an electronic state directly without channeling through the center - of - mass(cm ) motion of atom . </S>",
    "<S> gaussian part of lg beam profile which is generally neglected is found to have an important effect on oam transfer to rydberg atoms . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations are calculated based on this theory for rubidium rydberg atoms trapped in a harmonic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the results show optically induced mixing of different rydberg states , even of different parities , along with disparate charges of matter vortices . </S>"
