    "the use of atmospheric erenkov telescopes to make observations at large zenith angles was suggested by sommers and elbert @xcite as a potentially efficient method of measuring gamma rays at the highest energy .",
    "the underlying principle is that at large zenith angles , the footprint of an air shower as seen in optical erenkov light ( which is a penetrating component of the cascade ) becomes large .",
    "this means that , although the threshold energy of a telescope will increase as the zenith angle increases , the accompanying increase in collecting area results in a useful gamma ray detection rate .",
    "sommers and elbert discussed this large zenith angle technique in the context of first - generation ( non - imaging ) gamma ray telescopes .",
    "markarian 501 ( mrk 501 ) is a relatively close bl lac object ( at a red shift @xmath1 of 0.034 ) which shows strong , variable , non - thermal emission from radio to x - ray wavelengths . since its discovery as a vhe gamma ray source @xcite",
    ", mrk 501 has been extensively monitored in the vhe waveband . in 1997",
    ", the object went into a prolonged active state at all wavebands .",
    "the vhe activity was detected by a number of northern hemisphere facilities employing imaging techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this state of high activity lasted from 1997 march  october and the source exhibited a complex time history with flaring activity on a time scale as short as a few hours @xcite .",
    "multiwavelength studies of mrk 501 during this time have been reported @xcite and the energy spectrum at tev energies has been established @xcite .",
    "the upper bound to the tev energy spectrum of an agn is of considerable interest as it , together with the distance to the source , leads to a value for the density of intergalactic infra red photons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the highest energy photons observed from this source to date have been detected by the hegra group and are in excess of 25 tev @xcite .",
    "we report here observations of mrk 501 made from the southern hemisphere at zenith angles in excess of @xmath2 using the university of durham mark 6 imaging telescope .",
    "our measurements of cascades which develop through three atmospheres demonstrate that imaging techniques may be applied at these large zenith angles with the prospect of improving the significance of the gamma ray signal at high energies .",
    "the university of durham mark 6 telescope is located at narrabri nsw australia and has been described in detail @xcite .",
    "it uses the established imaging technique to separate gamma rays from background cosmic rays and incorporates a robust , noise - free trigger involving signals from three parabolic flux collectors of diameter 7 m mounted on a single alt - azimuth platform .",
    "the imaging camera comprises 109 pixels ( 91 with @xmath3 diameter and 18 with @xmath4 diameter ) and is mounted at the focus of the central flux detector .",
    "it combines with two low resolution cameras ( 19 pixels each of diameter @xmath4 ) which are mounted at the foci of the left and right flux collectors to provide a trigger demanding a simultaneous temporal ( 10 ns gate ) and spatial ( @xmath4 ) coincidence of the erenkov light detected in the three cameras .",
    "this trigger system allows the telescope to detect small light flashes , and hence low energy gamma rays , free of the triggers due to light produced by individual local muons .",
    "this is particularly important for observations at very large zenith angles when the background from local muons mimicking the signatures of gamma rays can become important .",
    "mrk 501 was observed in 1997 july and august under clear and moonless skies during an interval of extreme activity when detection rates for gamma rays @xmath5 gev ( using conventional imaging telescopes ) exceeded 10 photons per min ( see e.g. bradbury @xcite ) .",
    "data were recorded at zenith angles of @xmath0 using the standard mark 6 telescope procedure which involves recording data in 15 min segments .",
    "off source observations were taken by alternately observing regions of the sky which differ by @xmath6 min in right ascension from the position of mrk 501 so ensuring that the on and off segments possess identical azimuth and zenith profiles .",
    "this observing pattern , which involves reversal of the order of the on and off source measurements , eliminates any first order changes in telescope performance due to residual secular changes in atmospheric clarity , temperature etc .",
    "an observing log is shown in table [ table : observing_log ] .",
    "the background count rate of the telescope at @xmath2 to the zenith was about 70 cpm , some 10% of that at the directions close to the zenith where the telescope would normally be operated .",
    "a preliminary estimate of the threshold for gamma ray detection with the mark 6 telescope at @xmath2 to the zenith is @xmath7 tev which may be compared with the value of @xmath8 gev for zenith angles @xmath9 .",
    "we note that sommers and elbert @xcite estimate a factor of @xmath10 in threshold energy difference between zenith angles of @xmath11 and @xmath12 compared with the value of @xmath13 from our estimate .",
