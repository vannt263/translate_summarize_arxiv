    "real and virtual photon induced processes in the three - nucleon ( 3n ) system have been studied for a long time and these investigations go on with intensity .",
    "the reason is that beyond the deuteron the 3n system in the form of @xmath0he has been always considered since the very beginning of nuclear physics  @xcite as a challenge to be understood in terms of the available state of the art forces .",
    "then the next question followed naturally : what is the response of the 3n bound state to real and virtual photon absorption ?",
    "again answers have been searched for over the many years to the best of the available physical insights and technical feasibilities . here",
    "we point just to a few early studies  @xcite and refer the reader to the various reviews given below for the long history of that research .",
    "while the 3n bound states were numerically mastered already in the seventies and early eighties using nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces with realistic and complex spin - momentum structures  @xcite and later on adding first models for 3n forces  @xcite , the technical challenges for the 3n continuum with the complex asymptotic boundary conditions were much more demanding .",
    "but in the last 10 - 15 years also the 3n continuum got more and more under control  @xcite , which opened solid theoretical access to the great diversity of inelastic real and virtual photon induced reactions on @xmath0he and the nucleon - deuteron ( nd ) capture processes",
    ". there has been , and this is going on , an intensive interplay and reciprocal stimulation of theory and experiment , which justifies , as we think , a review of the present state of the art .",
    "elastic electron scattering on @xmath0he ( @xmath0h ) has been reviewed many times over the years  @xcite .",
    "the inclusive process @xmath3 has been reviewed in  @xcite . a very informative monograph on electron induced processes on nuclei including the 3n system is  @xcite .",
    "semiexclusive and above all exclusive electron induced processes on @xmath0he came into the focus only with the high - duty cycle electron accelerators ( nikhef , mami , jlab ) and reviews about those processes in the 3n system are not known to us . a good collection of references to old calculations on the photodisintegration of @xmath0he can be found in  @xcite .",
    "recent work on these processes is discussed and cited in  @xcite .",
    "variational approaches and rudimentary treatments of the 3n continuum in electromagnetically induced processes were used before the sixties and still in the early seventies and we refer the reader to the literature quoted in the above listed reviews . then with the faddeev formulation of the three - body system  @xcite or the equivalent alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations  @xcite , where the latter ones are ideally suited for finite rank forces , a new epoch started . in the following we shall not distinguish between the two and just call them for short `` faddeev approach '' . at that time , due to the lack of sufficiently strong computational resources , the nuclear potentials were chosen in a quite simple form , low rank separable ones .",
    "very first calculations for electrodisintegration of @xmath0he and @xmath0h in the faddeev scheme were performed in  @xcite , where the 3n bound state was treated correctly but in the final 3n continuum state only the interaction within the spectator pair was kept ( the two nucleons which have not absorbed the photon under a single nucleon current assumption ) .    very similar in nature and techniques is the photodisintegration , where the first faddeev calculation for the 3n continuum appeared in  @xcite and where the importance of the rescattering with the spectator nucleons was emphasized .",
    "one step further was the work in @xcite where for the two- and three - body photodisintegration of @xmath0he ( @xmath0h ) both , ground state and 3n continuum , were treated consistently as solutions of the schrdinger equation with the same 3n hamiltonian . this exact treatment , though still with simple nn forces , already allowed one to ask detailed questions  @xcite like the suppression of the isospin t=1/2 contribution in three - body photodisintegration of @xmath0he .",
    "then the first calculation for two - body electrodisintegration of @xmath0he ( @xmath0h ) came up in  @xcite .",
    "though also the formalism for three - body disintegration in the context of separable forces was formulated , limitations of computer resources prevented their realization .",
    "it then took quite some time that the three - body electrodisintegration has been treated  @xcite using simple @xmath4-wave local forces in an unitary pole expansion or only in the form of the unitary pole approximation .",
    "the conclusion was again that a proper description has to take into account contributions from the complete multiple scattering series , or in other words , that final state interaction ( fsi ) are important . due to the lack of kinematically complete breakup data ,",
    "the calculation of  @xcite was applied to a set of existing inclusive data , where the two- and three - body electrodisintegration processes are both involved .",
    "physically and formally closely related to electron induced processes is the proton - deuteron ( pd ) radiative capture reaction , where a first configuration space 3n calculation based on solutions of the faddeev equation for the 3n bound state and 3n scattering states appeared in  @xcite using the reid nn force @xcite .",
    "thereby , as in the following studies  @xcite , the interest was in the sensitivity of tensor analyzing powers to properties of the 3n bound state and to the nn tensor forces .",
    "the treatment of the initial state interaction in the pd capture processes turned out to be very crucial as well as the inclusion of higher nn force components . in @xcite realistic nn forces and even 3n forces were used in a consistent 3n faddeev treatment for both the ground state and the continuum states . in  @xcite separable forces were employed but also an ernst - shakin - thaler - expansion form of the paris potential .    at very low energies ( neutron - deuteron )",
    "nd capture was treated in  @xcite using a configuration space faddeev method and realistic nn and 3n forces .",
    "the method of correlated orthogonal states  @xcite represents the continuum to some extent and puts in short - range correlations . although the states are not proper solutions of the 3n hamiltonian , their use in studying inclusive response functions clearly showed significant improvements over plane - wave impulse approximation results and underlined the importance of treating the correlations between the three nucleons in the final state as consequently as in the 3n bound state .",
    "another development was the euclidean response method  @xcite applied to inclusive responses . by path",
    "integral techniques one calculates the laplace transform of the response functions and compares them to the corresponding laplace transformed data .",
    "this is an exact method and includes the full dynamics of the chosen hamiltonian .",
    "related to that are approaches with stieltjes transforms  @xcite or transformations by a lorentz kernel  @xcite .    around that time the first calculations appeared , where realistic nn forces , with all their complexities and including all the relevant higher nn force components , were applied to the pd(nd ) and three - nucleon electrodisintegration of @xmath0he ( @xmath0h ) in the faddeev scheme  @xcite . in that formulation",
    "the pd and ppn breakup of @xmath0he induced by an external probe can be calculated in `` one shot '' solving a faddeev like integral equation and avoiding the nasty low order rescattering processes occurring in the separate treatment of the 3n continuum  @xcite . for inclusive scattering",
    "a convenient short cut was found in @xcite using the closure relation for the eigenstates of the hamiltonian . in this manner",
    ", one avoids the explicit numerical integrations over all the available two - body and three - nucleon disintegration configurations .    in the older investigations",
    "mostly only the nonrelativistic single nucleon current operator has been used . for real photon induced processes it was supplemented by the siegert approach , which takes some exchange currents into account .",
    "this is insufficient and the explicit use of two - body currents ( and possibly three - body contributions when a three nucleon force ( 3nf ) is included ) is required .",
    "these dynamical ingredients are as complicated as nuclear forces and therefore progress is slow .",
    "an important practical step was performed in @xcite by associating two - body currents to nn forces through the continuity equation . in the case of the av18 nn force  @xcite",
    "that recipe has been used quite often  @xcite and is still applied .",
    "closely related studies connecting nn forces and two - body currents appeared in  @xcite .",
    "nearly all of the results shown in this review are based on our own work using the faddeev scheme in a purely nucleonic hilbert space .",
    "there are also other groups , which investigate real and virtual photon induced processes on light systems . for the wealth of insight and achievements in the case of the deuteron we refer to  @xcite . here",
    "we focus just on the 3n system .",
    "the group in pisa uses hyperspherical harmonic expansions of different types and treats bound and continuum states consistently .",
    "they use modern nuclear forces in all their complexities together with related currents .",
    "their focus is mostly on processes at very low energies  @xcite .",
    "this includes pd radiative capture , inclusive threshold electron scattering on @xmath0he , and pd breakup electrodisintegration of @xmath0he .",
    "the urbana - argonne group relies beside variational approaches on the green - function - monte - carlo method  @xcite .",
    "a good overview on the theory and their important results can be found in  @xcite . in the 3n system",
    "this comprises work on the elastic form factors , short - range correlations related to the coulomb sum rule , nd capture reactions , and euclidean inclusive response functions .",
    "the group in trento uses the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method  @xcite and employs also hyperspherical harmonic expansions . in this method",
    "one avoids the direct treatment of the continuum which requires the handling of the complex boundary conditions .",
    "instead that method converts the continuum problem into a bound state problem .",
    "the price to be paid is an inversion of auxiliary lorentz transformed amplitudes .",
    "the mathematical properties of that technique are displayed in  @xcite .",
    "this method is being applied not only to the 3n system but is powerful enough to go beyond a=3 using ideas of effective force expansions  @xcite .",
    "more recently the hanover group also started to thoroughly investigate the 3n continuum and photon induced reactions therein  @xcite .",
    "the new feature is the explicit inclusion of the @xmath5-degree of freedom .",
    "thus the hilbert space is the direct sum of nnn and nn@xmath5 states . in this manner a certain subset of 3n forces is taken care of as well as consistent two - body currents .",
    "last but not least we would like to point to the very rich list of investigations by j.m . laget who uses a diagrammatic approach .",
    "that work has stimulated many experimental investigations and sheds light on the reaction mechanisms .",
    "a recent paper @xcite discusses electrodisintegration of few - body systems high in momenta above our nonrelativistic domain but also provides many references to earlier studies , which are relevant to the work discussed in this review .",
    "for all technical details used by these other groups we refer the reader to the cited literature .",
    "we shall provide , however , information on their results at the appropriate places in section [ data ] .",
    "this review is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we describe our approach in the faddeev scheme for the great diversity of photon induced processes . a brief review on electromagnetic currents",
    "is given in section  [ currents ] .",
    "the observables are defined in section  [ observables ] .",
    "then section  [ performance ] describes the way we technically perform the calculations .",
    "section  [ data ] is devoted to a comparison of our theoretical results and some selected results by other groups to the data .",
    "much remains , however , to be done and we present in section  [ predictions ] an incomplete and subjective list of theoretical predictions , some of which will hopefully be testified in experiments in the near future . in section  [ addendum ]",
    "we provide remarks on several issues relevant in the 3n system which have not been addressed directly in this review .",
    "we end up with a summary and outlook in section  [ summary ] .",
    "let us start with a heuristic approach toward the photon induced complete breakup of @xmath0he .",
    "once the photon has been absorbed inside @xmath0he , the three nucleons are released but on the way of leaving the space spanned by the @xmath0he state they interact strongly .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] .",
    "clearly this infinite set of diagrams summarizes all what can happen in the 3n breakup process under the condition that the three nucleons are interacting by pairwise forces . because of the strength of nuclear forces that series is generally diverging for c.m .",
    "energies in the 3n system below the pion production threshold .",
    "it has to be summed up to infinite order .",
    "we follow here the faddeev scheme and perform first a partial re - summation of the nn forces into nn t - operators . apparently aside from the very first term without any interaction after the photon absorption process ( @xmath6 ) that set of diagrams",
    "can be split into 3 subsets according to the utmost left pair force @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the subset with @xmath9 to the left @xmath10 .",
    "let us regard the first few terms for @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ diagram2 ] :    by the very definition of the three subsets this equals @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the photon absorption operator , @xmath14 the @xmath0he state and @xmath15 the free 3n propagator .",
    "we combine the terms with @xmath11 on the left hand side @xmath16 invert @xmath17 and introduce the nn t - operator @xmath18 @xmath19 obviously , @xmath18 obeys the two - body lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath20 this leads to @xmath21 two more equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 arise in exactly the same manner .",
    "now we make use of the identity of the three nucleons .",
    "since the photon absorption operator @xmath13 has to be symmetrical under exchange of the three nucleons and the @xmath0he state is antisymmetrical one immediately obtains @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 interchanges nucleons @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xcite @xmath29 and we obtain @xmath30 this is already a faddeev type integral equation , which after iteration leads to the multiple scattering series , now formulated in terms of nn t - operators @xmath31 this is graphically depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagram3 ] .",
    "the whole breakup amplitude is then given as @xmath32 here @xmath6 is obtained by a simple quadrature and @xmath11 arises as solution of the one faddeev - like equation ( [ u01.6 ] ) .    written in a more definite manner as matrix element the breakup amplitude reads @xmath33 where the amplitude @xmath34 obeys according to ( [ u01.6 ] ) @xmath35 we dropped the index @xmath36 on t since one can choose any pair and we introduced the free 3n state @xmath37 . since @xmath38 and @xmath39 are totally antisymmetrical , we can assume @xmath37 to be antisymmetrical as well .",
    "let us now re - derive that result in a more standard algebraic manner including also 3n forces .",
    "the general form of the nuclear matrix element for an electroweak probe represented by a symmetric operator @xmath13 is given as @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the initial nucleus state and @xmath42 the final scattering state with asymptotic quantum numbers @xmath43 .",
    "it is generated as @xcite @xmath44 in the three - nucleon system and for inelastic processes @xmath43 stands either for asymptotic nd or 3n quantum numbers . in the latter case we already introduced the fully antisymmetrical state @xmath45 , which in our notation is given as @xmath46 where @xmath47 in the nonrelativistic regime is conveniently expressed in terms of jacobi momenta @xmath48    depending on which pair of nucleons",
    "is singled out there are three choices for the jacobi momenta .",
    "let us choose one of them and define @xmath49 @xmath50 , \\label{jacobiq}\\ ] ] where the @xmath51 are the individual laboratory momenta . in the notation ( [ varphi0 ] )",
    "we dropped additional spin and isospin quantum numbers .",
    "let us now firstly stick to the 3n breakup channel , thus @xmath52 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath53 occurring in ( [ psif ] ) contains nn and 3n forces on top of the kinetic energy @xmath54 @xmath55 one way to handle the 3n force operator @xmath56 is to split it into 3 parts @xmath57 where @xmath58 is symmetrical under exchange of nucleons @xmath28 and @xmath59 .",
    "such a splitting is always possible .",
    "thus it appears natural to combine the interactions as @xmath60 we introduced the standard and convenient notation @xmath61 .",
    "clearly both terms @xmath62 and @xmath58 are symmetrical under exchange of nucleons @xmath28 and @xmath59 .    now using the well known identity between the full resolvent operator @xmath63 occurring in ( [ psif ] ) and the free resolvent operator @xmath64 namely @xmath65 one obtains the lippmann - schwinger equation for @xmath66 as @xmath67 this suggests a decomposition of the total state into three parts and using again the identity of the three nucleons leads to @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 obeys the faddeev - like equation @xmath70 the driving term is @xmath71 thus in the 2n subsystem the antisymmetric free state @xmath72 is replaced by the two - body scattering state @xmath73 .",
    "the result for @xmath74 can now be inserted into the nuclear matrix element ( [ n ] ) : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the adjoint kernel to the one occurring in ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "the heuristically derived result ( [ u0.3 ] ) valid for @xmath77 can now be recovered easily .",
    "we use the identity @xmath78 and obtain @xmath79 @xmath80 with @xmath81 given by the integral equation @xmath82    this has to be compared to the result given in ( [ u0.3 ] ) and ( [ u ] ) . since @xmath83 is antisymmetrical , we obtain @xmath84 consequently , @xmath85 and the second term in ( [ n.3 ] ) yields @xmath86 which equals the second term in ( [ u0.3 ] ) .",
    "this is obvious by applying @xmath87 to the antisymmetrical state @xmath88 on the left yielding again a factor of 3 .",
    "this completes the verification of the heuristically derived result .",
    "including now the 3nf we define according to the expression ( [ n.2 ] ) @xmath89 or the equivalent integral equation @xmath90 the breakup matrix element is determined by means of @xmath91 according to ( [ psi ] ) - ( [ n.2 ] ) @xmath92 unfortunately , the form ( [ utildeprime.2 ] ) , although suitable for separable forces , is not appropriate for numerical applications with realistic interactions because of the presence of the permutation operator @xmath93 to the very left in the first part of the kernel@xcite .",
    "it would `` smear out '' the position of the deuteron singularity in the nn t - operator . to rewrite ( [ utildeprime.2 ] ) into a suitable form we use the following obvious identities",
    "@xmath94 @xmath95 then we obtain from ( [ utildeprime.2 ] ) @xmath96 @xmath97 or with the definition @xmath98 the following equation for @xmath99 @xmath100 this integral equation is now suitable for numerical applications and provides according to ( [ identity2 ] ) and ( [ newu ] ) the nuclear matrix element @xmath101    in order to separate the contribution from the plane wave alone ( @xmath102 ) and the symmetrized plane wave ( @xmath103 ) one can modify the driving term in ( [ utilde.2 ] ) and solve the following equation for @xmath104 @xmath105 \\ , ( 1 + p )   { \\cal o } \\mid \\psi_i \\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath106 with that auxiliary state @xmath107 the amplitude @xmath108 reads now @xmath109 dropping the second term and @xmath110 in the first term in ( [ n.5 ] ) one encounters two plane wave impulse approximations to the amplitude @xmath108 @xmath111 and @xmath112 while in ( [ n.pwia ] ) the final state is antisymmetrized only in one pair , in ( [ n.pwias ] ) it is fully antisymmetrized .",
    "the verification of ( [ utilde.3 ] ) and ( [ n.5 ] ) requires straightforward algebra .",
    "a completely alternative approach is based on two coupled faddeev equations , again starting from ( [ utildeprime.2 ] ) . defining @xmath113 and",
    "@xmath114 one obviously obtains the set of coupled equations for @xmath115 and @xmath116 @xmath117 these three states ( [ met09 ] ) , ( [ met10 ] ) and ( [ newuuu ] ) sum up by definition to @xmath118 which determines according to ( [ newu ] ) the breakup matrix element .",
    "inserting the definition of @xmath119 and using ( [ met11 ] ) again , the breakup matrix element is easily turned into the simpler form @xmath120    for the pd breakup of @xmath0he , the final channel state regarded up to now @xmath121 has simply to be replaced by @xmath122 thus the two - body scattering state @xmath123 turns into the deuteron state @xmath124 and the pd breakup matrix element is given as @xmath125 or @xmath126 if the auxiliary state @xmath127 is employed .",
    "if one uses the coupled set of equations , ( [ met11 ] ) , the matrix element @xmath128 will be @xmath129    we refrain to quote again the simpler equations given in @xcite valid for nn forces only .",
    "the more complex equations are necessary since for light nuclei  @xcite and few - nucleon scattering processes @xcite 3n forces are mandatory . in the context of effective field theory constrained by chiral symmetry",
    "nn and three- and more - nucleon forces are consistently linked to each other  @xcite .",
    "applications in that framework to few - nucleon systems  @xcite definitely show that more than pairwise forces are acting and are clearly visible in the measured values of the observables ( binding energies and scattering observables ) . this new approach grounded on effective field theory backs up the earlier results based on phenomenological forces which were constrained only by the one-@xmath1 exchange , that three - nucleon forces are necessary to describe the data .    the basic equations ( [ utilde.2 ] ) or ( [ met11 ] ) are valid for electron induced reactions and for real photon induced processes as well .",
    "they only differ in the choice of the photon absorption operator @xmath13 ( see section  [ currents ] ) .    in the case of nucleon - deuteron",
    "capture one can use time reversal invariance and evaluate the nuclear matrix element via nd photodisintegration of the 3n bound state as given in ( [ npd ] ) , ( [ npd2 ] ) or ( [ new44444444 ] ) . a more direct way is to choose the matrix element in the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the nd scattering state with appropriately chosen initial state quantum numbers @xmath27 , @xmath13 a suitable operator depending on the final photon momentum , and @xmath132 the 3n bound state . here",
    "we can use directly the faddeev equation for the 3n scattering state @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to ( [ psi ] ) and for the initial nd channel is given as @xmath133 here @xmath134 with appropriate initial spin quantum numbers .",
    "the total scattering state is then @xmath135    let us define the amplitude @xmath136 by @xmath137 where @xmath136 obeys the faddeev - like equation @xmath138    it is this central equation ( [ t.2 ] ) which we solve for 3n scattering @xcite .",
    "consequently the nuclear matrix element for nd capture is obtained in the form @xmath139",
    "while the treatment of the interacting nucleons in the 3n bound and scattering states is quite well established in the framework of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation , for the current operator , there is still quite some room for improvements .",
    "the current operator is a dynamical object containing in addition to a single nucleon term also the two- and three - body contributions , which are as complex as nuclear forces themselves .",
    "first considerations can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "a very nice discussion and review is given in  @xcite .",
    "earlier reviews for instance are @xcite and @xcite . since our review",
    "does not focus on this issue , we will only briefly describe what underlies our applications .",
    "one approach to include some of the many - body terms in the current , applied in the case of photodisintegration ( or nd capture ) , is based on the old siegert idea @xcite . the way we use it",
    "is described in section [ oursiegert ] .",
    "the other approach used for virtual and real photons is to link a certain subset of currents via the continuity equation to the nn force av18 , which has been phrased `` model independent '' in @xcite .",

    "we choose the laboratory frame for which the total momentum of the initial @xmath0he is zero and work with the jacobi momenta defined in ( [ jacobip ] ) and ( [ jacobiq ] ) . assuming that the photon couples to nucleon 1 , the initial ( @xmath601 ) and final ( @xmath629 ) individual momenta of the struck nucleon are given in terms of the jacobi momentum @xmath525 and the three - momentum transfer @xmath556 as @xmath630 @xmath631 further we put @xmath632 , which simplifies the calculation of the spherical @xmath633 components of the current operator given in ( [ sin.4 ] ) . since @xmath634    @xmath635    @xmath636    and @xmath637 we rewrite ( [ sin.4 ] ) as @xmath638 the first and the last parts in ( [ sin.4new ] ) correspond in the non - relativistic limit to the convection and spin current , respectively . the second and",

    "this shifts theory much closer to the data , especially at the higher @xmath624-values , which are not in the focus of this review .",

    "we would like to add brief remarks on several issues also relevant in the 3n system and which have not been addressed in this review : relativistic approaches , y - scaling and weak processes .",
    "these remarks will mostly serve to provide recent references .",
    "the * covariant spectator theory * includes relativity in a manifestly covariant way .",
    "it restricts all but one of the particles to their mass shell , which leads to the technically welcome property that all loop integrations are three - dimensional .",
    "also the manifest covariance goes with the property that all boosts are kinematic and the off - shell particle has negative energy components .",
    "cluster separability holds which in a hamiltonian approach has been formally solved in @xcite but presents a big challenge in the practical application .",
    "the spectator equations have been applied to the nn system including electromagnetic processes as well as to the 3n bound state .",
    "most recently a complete feynman diagram expansion for the electromagnetic form factors and the three - body photo- and electro - disintegration of the three - body bound state has been derived . for the long list of references",
    "see the most recent ones  @xcite another approach including relativity is the * relativistic hamiltonian dynamics*. the seminal paper is by e.p .",
    "wigner  @xcite .",
    "it lays the ground for the physical requirements of special relativity in quantum mechanics leading to the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an unitary ( ray ) representation of the inhomogeneous lorentz group ( poincare group ) in the quantum mechanical hilbert space .",

    "the balian - brezin method for treating angular momentum reduction in the faddev equation @xcite has been generalized to the relativistic case in @xcite .",
    "a very basic investigation @xcite shows , that given a relativistic hamiltonian dynamics it is possible to construct a conserved covariant current operator that satisfies cluster properties and which will produce any kind of experimental form factors .",
    "in other words , it shows , that poincare invariance , current covariance and cluster properties do not constrain form factors .",
    "the above citations refer to basic formalisms and we refrain to list the various applications of hamiltonian dynamics to electron scattering , which are anyhow mostly carried through for hadron form factors .",
    "this is outside the scope of this review .",
    "we restrict ourselves only to a few recent ones , which provide references to earlier work and to studies by j. carbonell and collaborators : @xcite .",
    "all that work briefly addressed opens the doors to generalize what has been presented in this review into a relativistic hamiltonian scheme .",
    "the issue of * y - scaling * has been nicely discussed in  @xcite including a rich list of references , among them the seminal work in @xcite by g. west and the theoretical investigations based on plane wave impulse approximation by the rome and rehovot groups @xcite , to mention just those two . under pwia",
    "it can be shown that the cross section in inclusive electron scattering , which depends on @xmath643 and @xmath209 , at high momentum transfers , after the cross section has been divided by an appropriately chosen single nucleon cross section , is a function of a single variable y. this y - scaling variable is itself a function of @xmath643 and @xmath209 .",
    "of course the question is , whether the underlying assumptions are realized in nature and especially , whether the interaction of the knocked out nucleon with the recoiling system can be neglected or sufficiently well taken into account .",
    "that issue has been critically studied in two model investigations , one in a nonrelativistic two - nucleon model @xcite , and one in a light front formalism of relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite , where a conserved model hadronic current operator has been used which is covariant with respect to a unitary representation of the poincare group .    *",
    "weak processes * have been discussed in @xcite where also references to previous work can be found . a more recent study @xcite evaluated the decay rate for the process @xmath644 including angular correlation parameters .",
    "the total rate agreed nicely with experiment and showed only a weak model dependence .",
    "the two - body currents , which turned out to be significant , could be constrained in the tritium beta decay .",
    "this paper also provides some clues on the induced pseudoscalar form factor @xmath645 .",
    "the process @xmath646 has been studied in @xcite using a faddeev treatment for bound and continuum states .",
    "only the single nucleon current has been employed .",
    "very large effects of the final state interaction have been found , which brought theory into the vicinity of the experimental decay rate @xmath647  @xcite .",
    "this review has been devoted to electron and photon induced processes in the 3n system , restricted to a mostly nonrelativistic kinematical regime .",
    "we focused on the faddeev scheme which for the various processes has been outlaid in some detail .",
    "this guarantees rigorous solutions of the 3n bound and scattering states for any type of nn and 3n forces .",
    "naturally the electromagnetic currents play a central role , too . since this issue of",
    "current has been dealt with at many places in the literature we were relatively brief and just described the two - body currents which were used in our calculations on top of the standard single nucleon current .",
    "these are the dominant @xmath1- and @xmath2-like currents related to the nn force av18 .",
    "then we provided expressions for the rich set of observables and explained in some detail how the different algebraic elements in the formalism are prepared in an angular momentum decomposition for the numerical implementation .",
    "the bulk of the review has been devoted to a comparison of theory and experiment and to theoretical predictions .",
    "the latter ones , if confronted with the data in the future , would challenge the dynamical assumptions even more stringently and systematically than what has been achieved up to now . our theoretical results which are compared to data are based on the av18/urbanaix hamiltonian model and one- and the dominant two - body currents related to av18 .",
    "the rich set of data comprises elastic electron scattering on @xmath0he and @xmath0h , inclusive electron scattering on @xmath0he and @xmath0h , nucleon - deuteron radiative capture and the time reversed process of pd photodisintegration of @xmath0he and finally the 3n photodisintegration of @xmath0he .",
    "we tried to include as many as possible of the data situated in our nonrelativistic regime , which we qualitatively defined by @xmath648  mev / c for the virtual photon and the three - nucleon c.m .",
    "energy below the pion threshold .",
    "clearly also in that kinematical domain some effects of relativity will be visible but they are not dealt with in this review except for a small study for the elastic electron scattering process on @xmath0he .",
    "the elastic form factors of @xmath0he and @xmath0h are rather well described in the low momentum region @xmath649  @xmath622 .",
    "the presence of the 3nf is noticeable and its effect goes in the right direction toward the data .",
    "our results are very similar to the ones achieved by the hanover group , which rely on a single @xmath5-isobar admixture model instead of an explicit 3nf .",
    "they are also similar to predictions of the pisa group and collaborators , who apply the same model hamiltonian as used in this review , but include additional currents .",
    "these currents when applied in the higher @xmath650-domain not studied in this review significantly improve the agreement with the data .",
    "the two inclusive response functions , @xmath379 and @xmath380 , in inclusive unpolarized electron scattering on @xmath0he and @xmath0h show overall a good agreement between theory and experiment with a slight underestimation , however , of @xmath379 in case of @xmath0h .",
    "interesting is the interplay of 3nf s and the two - body currents for @xmath380 , which have a tendency to cancel each other under our ( restricted ) dynamical assumptions .",
    "when a comparison was possible the results by the other groups are very similar to ours .",
    "the pisa and trento groups are able to include the pp coulomb force which is an important step forward",
    ". it will be very interesting to see its quantitative effect in detailed future studies , especially in the low momentum regime .",
    "if one allows for polarization of the incoming electron and the @xmath0he target two more response functions , @xmath651 and @xmath652 , in inclusive electron scattering are accessible with related asymmetries .",
    "we showed that the sensitivity to the magnetic form factor of the neutron survives in the transversal asymmetry @xmath653 despite the fact that all dynamical ingredients , fsi , 3nf effects and mec s play an important role in the low momentum region .",
    "this has been used to extract @xmath570 for @xmath654 and @xmath655  ( gev / c)@xmath656 , which are in good agreement with the @xmath570-values extracted using a deuteron target .",
    "we also draw attention to the coulomb sum rule which in principle is an excellent source of information on two - body correlations modified by two - body density and relativistic effects .",
    "unfortunately , due to strong cancellations the part of the coulomb sum which carries that information has large error bars , thus an improved set of data would be very informative .    in case of the pd electrodisintegration of @xmath0he we faced both , agreement and disagreement , around the quasi elastic proton knockout peak .",
    "this is a quite unsatisfactory situation , especially since a renewed theoretical analysis by the hanover group with a @xmath5-isobar admixture and therefore with a different dynamics found very similar results .",
    "this deserves further theoretical studies . in case of",
    "the deuteron knock out peak we also face disagreement , namely a severe overestimation of the data in the neighborhood of missing momentum @xmath657 despite the fact , that the 3nf for the measured configurations moves theory significantly in the direction of the data .",
    "for another set of data in parallel deuteron knockout kinematics the agreement with the data looks better but does not include the situation with @xmath657 . in relation to both peak areas",
    "we think that the pd electrodisintegration of @xmath0he requires further efforts both in experiment and theory , as will be also addressed below .    in radiative",
    "nd capture the cross section data are rather well described over a wide range of energies .",
    "this is not the case for the spin observables @xmath658 , @xmath501 and the tensor analyzing powers @xmath659 .",
    "there remains much room for improvements in the dynamical inputs .",
    "an important step forward in that direction has been done very recently by the pisa group with collaborators .",
    "they completed the current related to the av18/urbanaix model hamiltonian what indeed improved the agreement between the theory and experiment in the very low energy regime .",
    "but also there some discrepancies remained in the two vector analyzing powers . since",
    "similar discrepancies are also present in pure nd scattering  @xcite they might have a common origin , presumably missing spin structures in the 3nf .",
    "the experimental situation in pd photodisintegration of @xmath0he is quite controversial as has been displayed for the energy dependence of the cross section at a fixed angle and for the integrated cross section .",
    "the photon induced 3n breakup of @xmath0he is still a rather unsettled issue .",
    "the total breakup cross section data are severely controversial which precludes a conclusion about the validity of the theory for that process .",
    "the very few more exclusive data for that complete breakup unfortunately could not be analyzed properly by us since the experimental conditions about angular and energy acceptances were not sufficiently well documented in the literature . in any case , our point geometry results are at least in the neighborhood of those data given in the form @xmath660 .    in view of the existing data we think that more systematic measurements with possibly improved accuracy are needed to get better insight into the validity of the dynamical assumptions .",
    "for that aim we provided a few theoretical predictions , some of which at least will hopefully be addressed in future experiments .",
    "the two response functions @xmath661 and @xmath662 appearing with the helicity of the incoming electron show a great sensitivity to the dynamical input and especially @xmath662 for @xmath0he shows a strong variation in shape as a function of @xmath663 .",
    "the electron induced pd breakup of @xmath0he poses questions .",
    "for the proton knockout peak region we have shown three quite different cases .",
    "one is affected separately by fsi and by the 3nf , another one is predominantly just given by pwia alone , and a third one just by fsi with no effect of the 3nf",
    ". the second one would be especially important to be verified by experiment , since only the simplest ingredients enter , the @xmath0he state , the deuteron state , and the single nucleon current . in all three cases",
    "the effects of mec s are negligible .    in case of the deuteron knockout peak",
    "we also have selected three different situations in relation to the strength of the fsi effect and the mec contributions . since the deuteron is composite the mechanism of knockout is more complex than for the nucleon knockout .    despite the fact that the concept of the spectral function has been widely used in the literature",
    "we think that a more systematic approach to the situations where it is predicted to be useful and where it fails would be adequate .",
    "we displayed two examples out of many described before in  @xcite .",
    "the semiexclusive process @xmath664 , where both initial particles are polarized , would be also an interesting source of information about the interplay of dynamical ingredients .",
    "we showed two kinematical conditions . in one the asymmetry @xmath665 for",
    "the upper end of the knocked out neutron energy spectrum would be suitable to extract @xmath570 , since all curves , pwia , fsi23 , fsi , fsi + mec and finally fsi+mec+3nf",
    "coincide there . in the other case",
    "the pwia result differs strongly from the others and large corrections are necessary .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath666 , which in pwia is proportional to @xmath667 , requires in both chosen kinematical configurations always strong corrections from fsi .",
    "since @xmath0he carries little proton polarization the corresponding asymmetries are strongly influenced by final state interactions .",
    "for one kinematical condition we found that fsi23 alone would be quite misleading for @xmath665 but completely sufficient for @xmath666 , while for the other kinematical condition 3nf effects are significant for both asymmetries except at the upper end of the proton energy spectrum , where all curves ( except pwia ) coincide .",
    "we think that also these different scenarios deserve a systematic experimental study .",
    "we also investigated the question , whether the two - nucleon relative momentum distribution inside @xmath0he could be approached experimentally .",
    "we showed that in our kinematical regime this is not possible but at least for proton knockout under parallel kinematics the fsi23 dynamics is sufficient .",
    "thus the relative momentum distribution folded with the nn t - matrix would be accessible , except for an additional small shift caused by the action of the 3nf . in the case of the neutron knockout",
    "only the transversal response function exhibits that feature . for high @xmath668-values ,",
    "however , also @xmath379 can be expected to behave similarly .    finally , in the field of electrodisintegration we investigated the spin dependent momentum distribution for polarized proton - deuteron clusters in polarized @xmath0he .",
    "for the processes @xmath669 and @xmath670 under fully collinear condition it turned out , that only for rather low @xmath671 momenta we found a tendency that the two responses @xmath379 and @xmath380 properly divided by the electromagnetic nucleon form factors approach the sought - for momentum distributions for increasing @xmath663-values ; otherwise fsi and 3nf effects preclude that . nevertheless a measurement of that polarized setup would be quite interesting since all the dynamics comes into the play .",
    "3n photodisintegration of @xmath0he comprises a lot of detailed dynamical information .",
    "we found that the semiexclusive reactions @xmath672 and @xmath673 show quite a different dependence on the emitted nucleon energy and the emission angles . in all cases the 3nf effects",
    "are mostly washed out due to the integration over part of the phase space . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no data are available , but they would be very informative .    if one allows for polarization for the incoming photon and/or @xmath0he , analyzing powers and spin correlation coefficients can be measured in the semiexclusive processes .",
    "we found that at @xmath674  mev , especially for neutron emission , 3n force effects are quite significant in @xmath675 and in the spin correlation coefficients , while @xmath676 has no noticeable 3nf dependence . at @xmath677",
    "mev the 3nf effects have essentially disappeared .",
    "no data are available to the best of our knowledge .",
    "our last predictions in this review are for the most informative process , the exclusive @xmath678 reaction .",
    "we scanned the full phase space for 3nf effects and located the regions where they are as large as @xmath679 and above . even after averaging over certain angular and energy intervals carried out in two examples , the magnitudes of these effects survived .",
    "precise and well documented data ( for future analysis and possibly new dynamics ) would be very important .",
    "the comparison of data and theory in this review clearly demonstrated that the chosen dynamics , forces and currents , is more or less adequate . in most cases we encountered fair to good agreement with the data but also in some cases clear discrepancies .",
    "since for pure hadronic processes in few - nucleon systems , especially in the well investigated 3n continuum , the av18/urbanaix hamiltonian model leads to similar agreements and disagreements , the reason for certain discrepancies in the electromagnetically induced processes can not be searched alone in the additional ingredient , the electromagnetic current operator , but also in the deficiencies of that hamiltonian model .",
    "certainly additional spin structures in the 3nf model are required .",
    "this has been already noticed in pure 3n scattering @xcite but also in the description of spectra of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "additional 3nf models introduced recently @xcite improved the theoretical spectra . therefore , proceeding in this manner and allowing for corresponding additional currents and relativistic features might be one way to go to achieve more quantitative results .",
    "another approach emerged in recent years based on effective field theory , either in the pion - less form or explicitly including the pion degrees of freedom in a form constrained by spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and including explicitly broken parts .",
    "this is a systematic approach which is controlled in the low momentum region by a smallness parameter .",
    "therefore the predictions can be improved systematically and theoretical errors can be estimated .",
    "this new approach to low energy nuclear physics is very promising .",
    "it relies on effective langragians , which allow for well defined couplings to electroweak fields , provides internal connections between nn and many - nucleon forces , and generates systematically relativistic corrections .",
    "of course this approach is restricted to generic external momenta below a certain mass scale .",
    "we refer the reader to several reviews @xcite on these kind of approaches and cite only a short subjective list of papers out of very many , which we think are very relevant to investigate few - nucleon systems without and with electroweak probes .",
    "more references can be found there .",
    "the approach to nuclear forces based on effective field theory constrained by chiral symmetry goes back to s. weinberg  @xcite .",
    "first applications were pioneered in @xcite .",
    "this was followed up in an extended and improved manner in @xcite pushing nn forces to next - to - next - to - next - to leading order ( n@xmath0lo ) in the chiral expansion .",
    "thereby it has to be emphasized that the 3nf s and beyond are consistent to the nn forces .",
    "various applications @xcite clearly demonstrated the success of that approach . in the pion - less form , restricted to a lower momentum regime , also convincing successful strides have been performed @xcite .",
    "coupling to electroweak fields has been investigated without and with explicit pions @xcite .",
    "we expect that these approaches will put low energy nuclear physics including electroweak processes on a firm ground and will enable well founded applications like for astrophysical issues .",

    "<S> a big spectrum of processes induced by real and virtual photons on the @xmath0he and @xmath0h nuclei is theoretically investigated through many examples based on nonrelativistic faddeev calculations for bound and continuum states . </S>",
    "<S> the modern nucleon - nucleon potential av18 together with the three - nucleon force urbanaix is used . </S>",
    "<S> the single nucleon current is augmented by explicit @xmath1- and @xmath2-like two - body currents which fulfill the current continuity equation together with the corresponding parts of the av18 potential . </S>",
    "<S> we also employ the siegert theorem , which induces many - body contributions to the current operator . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of these different dynamical ingredients in the various electromagnetic processes is studied and the theory is compared to the experimental data . overall we find fair to good agreement but also cases of strong disagreement between theory and experiment , which calls for improved dynamics . in several cases </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader to the work of other groups and compare their results with ours . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we list a number of predictions for observables in different processes which would challenge this dynamical scenario even more stringently and systematically . </S>"
