    "if a 4-manifold @xmath12 contains a 2-dimensional torus @xmath13 with square 0 , then we can perform a _ logarithmic transformation _ on @xmath13 : deleting the tubular neighborhood of @xmath13 ( which is diffeomorphic to @xmath14 ) and regluing it via a diffeomorphism @xmath15 we get a new manifold @xmath16 .",
    "it turnes out that if @xmath13 is the fiber in a gompf nucleus @xmath17 , then the diffeomorphism type of @xmath16 will depend only on one nonnegative number @xmath18 associated to @xmath19 .",

    "there is a manifold @xmath25 such that @xmath25 does not contain @xmath22 .",
    "[ masodiktetel ]    a related question would be to find a 4-manifold @xmath21 with the property that @xmath21 does not contain @xmath26 ; here @xmath26 denotes the 4-manifold with boundary we get by performing two logarithmic transformations ( of multiplicity @xmath18 and @xmath27 ) along the fiber of the gompf nucleus @xmath0 .",

    "a cohomology class @xmath29 with @xmath30 uniquely determines a spin@xmath31 structure on @xmath21 , and for such a structure a certain pair of partial differential equations ( the so - called seiberg - witten equations ) can be described  involving a choice of metric on @xmath21 , a coupled dirac operator and a perturbation 2-form . by a delicate `` counting argument '' of the solutions of these equations",
    "a number @xmath32 can be associated to the cohomology class @xmath33 .",

    "moreover , for a fixed 4-manifold @xmath21 there are only finitely many classes @xmath33 with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .     the cohomology class @xmath38 is called a _ seiberg - witten basic class _ if @xmath36 .",

    "the most important relation between the smooth topology of a 4-manifold @xmath21 and its basic classes @xmath42 is shown by the _ generalized adjunction formula _ :    ( kronheimer - mrowka ) if @xmath43 is a smooth , connected 2-dimensional surface of genus @xmath44 , @xmath45\\neq 0 $ ] and @xmath45 ^ 2\\geq 0 $ ] , then for every basic class @xmath33 we have @xmath46 ^ 2+\\vert k([\\sigma ] ) \\vert .\\ ] ]",
