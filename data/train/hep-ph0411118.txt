    "non - zero single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in hard scattering processes represent a very interesting phenomenon in particle physics .",
    "for instance , large asymmetries ( up to @xmath0 ) have been observed more than one decade ago in proton - proton collisions ( @xmath1 ) , where one of the protons is transversely polarized  @xcite .",
    "( for related theoretical work see  @xcite as well as  @xcite and references therein . ) moreover , in lepton scattering off the nucleon non - zero results for various ssa have been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "these results are surprising because in the leading twist collinear factorization approach for hard processes ssa strictly vanish  @xcite . in order to get non - zero effects",
    "one has to go beyond the collinear picture and to take the transverse momentum of partons inside the hadrons into account . in this context , a special role is played by transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) , time - reversal odd ( t - odd ) correlation functions ( parton distributions and fragmentation functions ) which are directly connected to the ssa . therefore , the recent progress in the understanding of ssa that has been achieved over the past three years is actually progress in the understanding of the origin and of the properties of t - odd correlation functions .",
    "the starting point was a model calculation for inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) which has shown the importance of gluon exchange between the struck quark and the target spectators  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this rescattering effect causes ( additional ) on - shell intermediate states in the compton amplitude , resulting in a modification of the dis cross section . in feynman gauge , this ( shadowing ) effect is described by the gauge link appearing in the operator definiton of parton distributions .    subsequently , the effect of rescattering has also been investigated in the case of semi - inclusive dis  @xcite . using a simple spectator model",
    ", it has been shown that a non - zero ssa for a transversely polarized target arises from the interference between the tree - level amplitude of the fragmentation process and the imaginary part of the one - loop amplitude , where the latter describes the gluon exchange between the struck quark and the target system .",
    "this asymmetry has been interpreted as model for the t - odd sivers parton distribution  @xcite including its gauge link  @xcite .",
    "the model calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite has therefore shown for the first time explicitly that t - odd parton distributions can be non - zero , which is in contrast to the long - standing believe that they should vanish because of t - invariance of the strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "consequently , t - odd parton distributions may ( partly ) be at the origin of the experimentally observed ssa .    while t - odd parton distributions are non - zero only if the gauge link is taken into account , t - odd fragmentation functions may well exist even if the rescattering associated with their gauge link is neglected .",
    "final state interactions can generate finite ssa in parton fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "but the presence of the gauge link endangers universality of tmd fragmentation functions , i.e. , it is a non - trivial question whether the fragmentation functions in dis and in electron - positron annihilation coincide . whereas time - reversal can be used to relate parton distributions between dis and the drell yan process  @xcite , such an argument can not be applied for fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "however , a one - loop calculation for a ssa in fragmentation , analogous to the treatment of the target asymmetry in ref .",
    "@xcite , has shown universality for t - odd fragmentation functions  @xcite . in a recent work",
    "it has been argued that the finding in  @xcite is not a model - artefact but rather a general result  @xcite .    in  @xcite the spectator model calculation for ssa in semi - inclusive dis of ref .",
    "@xcite has been extended to the case of a longitudinally polarized lepton beam and a longitudinally polarized target .",
    "for both asymmetries , which are of subleading twist ( twist-3 ) , non - zero results have been found .",
    "the results have indicated the existence of previously unknown subleading twist t - odd parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has been confirmed recently by a model - independent analysis  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this short review is to discuss the three mentioned developments on the field of single spin asymmetries and tmd correlation functions , i.e. , ( 1 ) the non - vanishing of t - odd parton distributions , ( 2 ) the universality of tmd fragmentation functions , ( 3 ) the discovery of so far unknown t - odd parton distributions at subleading twist",
    ". our emphasis will be on the model calculations which in all three cases preceded the model - independent studies .",
    "in this section we summarize certain features of parton distributions and fragmentation functions which are needed for the discussion lateron .",
    "the classical process by which parton distributions of the nucleon are measured is lepton - induced inclusive dis , like @xmath2 .",
    "this reaction provides information about the leading twist parton distributions @xmath3 ( distribution of unpolarized quarks in an unpolarized nucleon ) and @xmath4 ( distribution of longitudinally polarized quarks in a longitudinally polarized nucleon ) .",
    "the third twist-2 distribution , the transversity @xmath5 ( distribution of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized nucleon ) , can not be extracted from inclusive dis data because of its chiral - odd nature  @xcite .",
    "a proper definition of these three distributions is given in terms of the light - cone correlator @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ e : corr_1 ] ) the target state is characterized by its four - momentum @xmath7 and the covariant spin vector @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "the longitudinal quark momentum is specified by @xmath10 via @xmath11 .",
    "the quark fields carry a dirac index , while flavor and color indices are suppressed . in order to ensure color gauge invariance of the correlator the wilson - line @xmath12\\ ] ] connecting the two quark fields",
    "is needed .",
    "it is well known that this gauge link encodes the re - interaction of the struck quark with the target system via the exchange of collinear gluons . in light - cone gauge ( @xmath13 )",
    "the link disappears .",
    "the parton distributions can now be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ e : corr_1 ] ) using suitable projections .",
    "for instance , the unpolarized quark distribution is given by @xmath14 .",
    "in inclusive dis only the longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck parton is fixed by external kinematics , while its transverse momentum can not be measured but is rather integrated over .",
    "this situation changes in semi - inclusive dis ( like @xmath15 ) , where in addition to the scattered electron a hadron @xmath16 is detected in the final state .",
    "if the cross section is kept differential in the transverse momentum @xmath17 of the hadron , one is sensitive to both the transverse momentum on the parton distribution side ( transverse momentum of the quark relative to the target ) and on the fragmentation side . at tree level",
    ", it is relatively easy to establish factorization into tmd parton distributions , tmd fragmentation functions and a hard scattering  @xcite .",
    "the drell - yan process ( like @xmath18 ) with a low transverse momentum of the lepton - pair , and the reaction @xmath19 , where the two detected hadrons in back - to - back jets have a low transverse momentum relative to each other , can be described within the same formalism of ref .",
    "once gluonic corrections are included it becomes quite complicated to establish qcd - factorization for this class of processes  @xcite .",
    "one source of the complications is the presence of soft gluons , which lead to an additional non - perturbative factor ( soft factor ) in a factorization formula . in the case of the one - loop calculations for",
    "t - odd correlation functions to be discussed below these difficulties do nt show up yet .",
    "therefore , we refrain from elaborating more on this issue here .",
    "the correlator through which the tmd parton distributions are defined reads @xmath20 where the parton distributions can again be obtained using suitable projections .",
    "it turns out that eight tmd parton distributions can appear at leading twist  @xcite , i.e. , at leading order of a @xmath21-expansion of observables , where @xmath22 denotes the hard external momentum of the process .",
    "in contrast to the correlation functions which show up in inclusive processes , with two quark fields separated only along one light - cone direction , the quark fields in eq .",
    "( [ e : corr_2 ] ) have also a separation in transverse position space .",
    "moreover , for a proper definition of tmd parton distributions the gauge link in ( [ e : corr_2 ] ) must not connect the quark fields by the shortest line but rather has to take the form  @xcite @xmath23   \\mbox { } \\times   [ 0,\\infty,\\vec{0}_{\\perp};0,\\infty,\\vec{\\xi}_{\\perp } ]   \\mbox { } \\times   [ 0,\\infty,\\vec{\\xi}_{\\perp};0,\\xi^-,\\vec{\\xi}_{\\perp } ] \\,.\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath24 $ ] denotes the wilson line connecting the points @xmath25 and @xmath26 along a straight line . in covariant gauges like feynman",
    "gauge the wilson line at the light - cone infinity ( second piece on the _ rhs _ in eq .",
    "( [ e : linedis ] ) ) can be neglected .",
    "however , this line has to be taken into account in light - cone gauge  @xcite , because the transverse gluon potential does nt vanish at the light - cone infinity .",
    "it is now important to note that the path of the gauge link depends on the process . while for dis the wilson lines are future - pointing , they are past - pointing for drell - yan  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath27   \\mbox { } \\times   [ 0,-\\infty,\\vec{0}_{\\perp};0,-\\infty,\\vec{\\xi}_{\\perp } ]   \\mbox { } \\times   [ 0,-\\infty,\\vec{\\xi}_{\\perp};0,\\xi^-,\\vec{\\xi}_{\\perp } ] \\,.\\ ] ] as a consequence , the definitions of tmd parton distributions are different for both processes , i.e. , there is a danger of non - universality for these objects .",
    "exactly the same feature appears in the case of tmd fragmentation functions , which _ a priori _ have a different gauge link in semi - inclusive dis compared to @xmath28 annihilation  @xcite . whether and how one can still obtain universality for these tmd correlation functions will be discussed in the following two sections .",
    "two out of the eight leading twist tmd parton distributions are t - odd , and will be of particular importance for the subsequent discussion .",
    "the same holds for t - odd fragmentation functions . the following list ( in the notation of refs .",
    "@xcite ) summarizes these functions and their meaning :    * @xmath29 : distribution of an unpolarized quark in a transversely polarized target  @xcite * @xmath30 : distribution of a transversely polarized quark in an unpolarized target  @xcite * @xmath31 : fragmentation of an unpolarized quark into a transversely polarized hadron  @xcite * @xmath32 : fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into an unpolarized hadron  @xcite    t - odd correlation functions typically generate azimuthal / single spin asymmetries . for instance , in the case of the sivers function @xmath29 one is dealing with a ( t - odd ) correlation @xmath33 between the transverse target spin @xmath34 , the target momentum @xmath35 , and the transverse momentum of the quark @xmath36 . for a fixed target spin , this correlation gives rise to an azimuthal asymmetry of the quark distribution about the axis defined by the target momentum .",
    "in 1993 , it was proved that t - odd parton distributions should vanish because of t - invariance of the strong interaction  @xcite .",
    "( this claim lateron needed to be revised as will be explained in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] . ) in contrast , t - odd fragmentation functions can exist because of final state interactions in the fragmentation process .",
    "such interactions can lead to a non - trivial phase ( imaginary part ) in the scattering amplitude , which is needed to obtain a finite t - odd asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "we now turn the attention to possible observable effects of the wilson line discussed in the previous section , i.e. , effects due to the rescattering of the struck quark via the exchange of longitudinally polarized gluons .",
    "it has been demonstrated that even for inclusive dis this rescattering influences the cross section  @xcite . to be specific",
    ", it yields a reduction of the cross section which can be interpreted as shadowing effect  @xcite .",
    "an observable being entirely connected with the gauge link has then been considered in ref .  @xcite . in this work",
    "a simple model for a ssa with a transversely polarized spin-@xmath37 target has been constructed which will be discussed in some detail in this section .",
    "the relevant process is @xmath38 and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the quark @xmath39 in the final state may either fragment into hadrons plus remnants or form a jet . for our purpose , however , it is not necessary to consider the hadronization of the quark .",
    "a simple spectator model with a scalar diquark spectator @xmath40 is used for the ( proton ) target  @xcite . in this model",
    "the proton has no electromagnetic charge , and a charge @xmath41 is assigned to the quark .",
    "the interaction between the proton , the quark and the spectator is given by a scalar vertex with the coupling constant @xmath42 .",
    "we treat the process  ( [ e : proc_dis ] ) in the breit frame of the virtual photon .",
    "( note that in  @xcite a different reference frame was used . )",
    "the proton has a large plus - momentum @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",
    "the quark carries the large minus - momentum @xmath45 and a soft transverse momentum @xmath46 .",
    "these requirements specify the kinematics : @xmath47 the expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath48 are exact , while for @xmath49 and @xmath50 just the leading terms have been listed . in particular ,",
    "sometimes the @xmath51 corrections of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are needed which can be readily obtained from 4-momentum conservation .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    in the breit frame the leading twist contribution is given by the two transverse components @xmath54 of the electromagnetic current .",
    "( we define the current through the scattering amplitude via @xmath55 , with @xmath56 denoting the polarization vector of the virtual photon . ) for our purpose it is sufficient to treat @xmath57 , which reads for the tree - level diagram on the _ lhs _ in fig .

    "( [ e : tree ] ) into account leads to a vanishing asymmetry because the scattering amplitude has no imaginary part .",
    "in order to generate a finite imaginary part loop corrections have to be included , where we limit the analysis to the one - loop approximation . for simplicity",
    ", the gluon exchange is modelled by an abelian gauge field  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that for the process in  ( [ e : proc_dis ] ) only the box graph on the _ rhs _ in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , which describes the re - interaction of the struck quark with the target system to lowest order , gives rise to an imaginary part .",
    "now one indeed obtains a non - zero transverse ssa which is given by the interference of the tree - level amplitude with the imaginary part of the one - loop amplitude .",
    "explicitly , one finds  @xcite @xmath61 obviously , the asymmetry vanishes if the transverse momentum of the quark vanishes .",
    "we emphasize again that the ssa would be zero if there were no re - interaction of the struck quark .    soon after the publication of ref .",
    "@xcite it has been realized that the asymmetry in  ( [ e : asy ] ) is actually not a new effect , but can rather be understood as a model calculation for the t - odd sivers function including its gauge link  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the work in  @xcite has demonstrated for the first time explicitly that t - odd parton distributions can be non - zero .",
    "this result was at variance with the proof  @xcite according to which t - odd parton distributions should vanish because of t - invarince of the strong interaction .",
    "in fact it turned out that the proof no longer holds once the gauge link is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:2 ]    as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] , the parton distributions in dis and drell - yan have a different gauge link which endangers their universality . nevertheless , the two definitions can still be related using time - reversal .",
    "it has been found that all six t - even tmd parton distributions are universal , while a violation of universality appears only for the two t - odd functions in the sense that they have a reversed sign in both processes  @xcite , @xmath62 from a practical point of view this violation of universality has no direct consequence , since the possibility of relating cross sections of different processes is not spoiled .",
    "an experimental investigation of the relations  ( [ e : univpdf_a],[e : univpdf_b ] ) would serve as a very important check of our present - day understanding of the nature of t - odd parton distributions and , hence , our understanding of ssa .",
    "now we want to investigate the influence of the wilson line on the fragmentation process .",
    "fragmentation functions in dis and @xmath28 annihilation _ a priori _ have different wilson lines ( future - pointing for @xmath28 , past - pointing for dis ) .",
    "however , in contrast to parton distributions , they can not be related using time - reversal because they involve a semi - inclusive sum over out - states  @xcite , @xmath63 time - reversal converts these into in - states , and therefore is useless in order to establish any relation between the fragmentation functions for both reactions .",
    "this means that fragmentation functions are non - universal , unless another argument comes to our aid . to investigate this point a model calculation for a transverse ssa in fragmentation ( unpolarized quark into transversely polarized hadron , i.e.",
    ", a model for @xmath31 ) has been performed  @xcite , which is quite similar to the calculation discussed in the previous section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the tree - level diagrams of the fragmentation in @xmath28 annihilation and in dis are displayed . for @xmath28 annihilation",
    "we consider the decay of a timelike virtual photon into a @xmath64 pair , where the quark fragments into a spin-@xmath37 hadron ( e.g. a proton ) and a scalar remnant , i.e. , @xmath65 the fragmentation of the quark is described in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite used in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] .",
    "the one - loop corrections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . for @xmath28 annihilation ( semi - inclusive dis )",
    "a single abelian gluon is exchanged between the remnant and the antiquark ( initial quark ) .",
    "these diagrams provide a simple model for the lowest order contribution of the gauge link of the fragmentation function .",
    "two cuts ( on - shell quark and antiquark , as well as on - shell antiquark and remnant ) for @xmath28 annihilation have no counterpart in semi - inclusive dis .",
    "the quark - photon cut in @xmath28 annihilation corresponds to the cut in dis .",
    "note that the one - loop correction at the photon vertex , which is also related to the gauge link of the fragmentation function , is irrelevant for a transverse ssa , i.e. , it neither contributes to @xmath31 nor to @xmath32 .",
    "all remaining one - loop graphs have no relation to the gauge link .",
    "these effects are obviously universal ( see , e.g. , also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and wo nt be considered in the following .",
    "the calculation for the transverse ssa is similar to the case of the target asymmetry considered in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] .",
    "here we just focus on the main results , while detailed formulae can be found in ref .",
    "we first consider the two on - shell intermediate states in @xmath28 annihilation which have no counterpart in dis and , hence , form a potential source of non - universality of the transverse ssa .",
    "however , it turns out that the contributions of both intermediate states to the ssa cancel each other  @xcite , @xmath66 this cancellation is exact for the leading twist term of the asymmetry , which is sufficient for our investigation here . at subleading twist the equality  ( [ e : cancel ] ) breaks down .",
    "one is now left with the on - shell @xmath67 intermediate state only . by explicit calculation",
    "it has been shown that the corresponding contribution to the ssa coincides for both processes  @xcite , @xmath68 i.e. , the asymmetry in both processes has the same sign . in particular , one does not observe a sign - reversal for the one - loop box graph that is associated with the gauge link of the fragmentation function .",
    "the origin for the different behaviour compared to the t - odd target asymmetry is directly related to the different kinematics one is dealing with in fragmentation .",
    "note for instance that , in contrast to the case of the target asymmetry , in fragmentation the surviving contribution to the ssa involves a cut of the gauge boson propagator .",
    "[ fig:3 ]    altogether , one finds that the total transverse ssa in @xmath28 annihilation and in semi - inclusive dis are equal , i.e , the t - odd fragmentation of an unpolarized quark into a transversely polarized spin-@xmath37 hadron is universal in the one - loop model .",
    "this implies universality of the fragmentation function @xmath31 .",
    "the same conclusion holds for the collins function as well  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have the results @xmath69    this model calculation has indicated that fragmentation functions might well be universal despite the _ a priori _ reversed wilson lines they have in @xmath28 annihilation compared to semi - inclusive dis .",
    "recently , it has indeed been shown by a more general analysis that this suspicion is true  @xcite .",
    "universality not only holds for the two t - odd fragmentation functions but also for the t - even ones .",
    "moreover , it has been argued that it should be valid to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the crucial observation is that , due to the special analytical structure of the fragmentation process , one is not sensitive to the direction of the wilson lines .",
    "in particular , factorization for semi - inclusive dis can be derived with both past - pointing and future - pointing wilson lines for the fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "the transverse ssa @xmath70 in semi - inclusive dis discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] is a leading twist observable .",
    "one may wonder whether also the subleading asymmetries @xmath71 ( longitudinally polarized target ) and @xmath72 ( longitudinally polarized lepton ) are affected by the rescattering of the struck quark .",
    "it is quite important to clarify this issue , because most of the existing data and of the analyses ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) are concerned with these twist-3 observables .    in",
    "most of the theoretical papers a formalism is used which only includes t - odd fragmentation functions  @xcite . in this scenario one",
    "finds schematically @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with the twist-3 t - even parton distributions @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the most recent works in refs .",
    "@xcite on the beam spin asymmetry extended the analysis by considering also t - odd parton distributions .",
    "this leads for @xmath72 to an additional term @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a twist-3 fragmentation function .",
    "however , it was still unclear if also possible higher twist t - odd distribution functions , generated by the same rescattering mechanism that leads to twist-2 t - odd functions , could be relevant for the longitudinal ssa .    in order to proceed at this point , the spectator model calculation for @xmath70 in ref .",
    "@xcite was extended to the twist-3 case  @xcite . in this work , @xmath72 was computed from the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , and a non - zero result was obtained .",
    "but it turned out that , at the twist-3 level , the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] no longer satisfy electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "this has been corrected in ref .",
    "@xcite by including the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , where the photon couples to the diquark spectator .",
    "moreover , also the target spin asymmetry @xmath71 has been computed in  @xcite .",
    "the gauge invariant treatment yields non - zero results for both asymmetries , @xmath79 where details of the calculation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the implications of this calculation .",
    "first of all , it is obvious that the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] are not compatible with the parton model , and therefore are also not compatible with factorization .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that factorization for semi - inclusive dis is broken at subleading twist , even if it has not yet been proved .",
    "one rather reaches the limitations of the perturbative spectator model for the nucleon .",
    "in particular , one finds that large momentum transfers at the proton - quark - diquark vertex , which appear in the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , are not suppressed .",
    "actually they get enhanced , which is at variance with the parton model .    despite this shortcoming of the spectator model",
    ", it has been argued that in a parton model description of @xmath72 and @xmath72 subleading t - odd distributions should be present  @xcite .",
    "mainly for two reasons this speculation has been made : first , within the model calculation non - zero asymmetries arise already from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] whose kinematics is compatible with the parton model .",
    "second , there is no reason why the asymmetries should not contain higher order t - odd distribution functions .",
    "a revised parton model analysis for @xmath72 and @xmath71 lateron has confirmed this speculation  @xcite .",
    "both asymmetries contain an additional term with a twist-3 t - odd distribution function , which have not been taken into account in the literature before .",
    "the main observation has been that additional functions are generated once the gauge link in the correlator in eq .",
    "( [ e : corr_2 ] ) is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "we have summarized important recent progress in the understanding of single spin asymmetries in hard scattering processes .",
    "all these developments are based on the fact that collinear gluon exchange ( e.g. , in dis between the struck quark and the target system ) leads to observable effects . in a factorized description",
    "these contributions are encoded in the gauge link of parton distributions and fragmentation functions .",
    "the most striking influence of collinear gluons appears in the case of single spin asymmetries / t - odd correlation functions .",
    "while t - odd fragmentation functions are non - zero without such gluon exchange , t - odd parton distributions vanish if their gauge link is neglected .",
    "the existence of t - odd parton distributions considerably enriches the phenomenology of single spin asymmetries .",
    "for instance , in semi - inclusive dis such effects not only enter the leading twist asymmetry @xmath70 , but also the twist-3 observables @xmath71 and @xmath72 . since the gauge link is process dependent , it endangers the universality of transverse momentum dependent correlation functions .",
    "however , it has been shown that the only violation of universality appears for t - odd parton distributions in terms of a reversed sign between dis and the drell - yan process .",
