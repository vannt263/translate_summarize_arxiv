    "the fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research )  @xcite accelerators will provide heavy ion beams up to uranium at beam energies ranging from 2 - 45 agev ( for z / a=0.5 ) and up to 35 agev for z / a=0.4 .",
    "the maximum proton beam energy is 90 gev .",
    "the planed ion beam intensity is @xmath13 per second .",
    "the cbm ( compressed baryonic matter )  @xcite detector will have good possibilities for vertex reconstruction , tracking and identification of particles ( hadrons , leptons and photons ) .",
    "though direct photons are of great interest for the research program of the cbm experiment , a feasibility study has not been done yet .    during high - energy heavy - ion collisions",
    "direct photons , defined as photons not from particle decays , have very little interaction with the surrounding medium and are therefore not altered by rescattering .",
    "therefore , they provide a very interesting probe and convey unique and unperturbed information on the all stages of the collision ( see , e.g. the review  @xcite ) .    on the quark - gluon level",
    "the main processes are compton scattering @xmath14 and annihilation @xmath15 .",
    "photons from initial hard nn collisions are named prompt photons and are the main source at large @xmath16 . on the hadron level",
    "the main source of direct photons is meson rescatterings : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , ... first two channels are most important .",
    "direct photons from a thermalized quark - gluon or hadron system , if any , are named thermal photons and are the main source at low @xmath16 .",
    "most of theoretical predictions for direct photons assume the local thermalization , evaluate photon production rates from the equilibrated quark - gluon or hadron system which then are convoluted with space - time evolution of the system .    of cause , during the nucleus - nucleus collision",
    "there is a non - equilibrium stage .",
    "it can be described by the transport approach free from the local thermalization assumption .",
    "however , most of existing transport codes do not include the hadronic source ( meson rescatterings ) of direct photons  @xcite .",
    "identification of direct photons in heavy - ion collisions is a very difficult experimental task , especially at low transverse momentum , because of the large background from decay photons , mostly from @xmath21 decays .",
    "first direct photons , @xmath22 20% at @xmath1 1.5 gev / c , have been extracted by the wa98 collaboration at sps  @xcite .",
    "the phenix collaboration at rhic using a novel analysis technique decreased a systematic error to 2 - 3% and revealed direct photons since @xmath1 1 gev / c , @xmath22 10% at @xmath23 1 - 2 gev / c  @xcite .    here",
    "we would like to estimate for the fair energies : prompt photons using the extrapolation of existing @xmath24 data and photon contribution from hadron sources exploiting as the microscopic hadron - string - dynamics  ( hsd ) transport approach  @xcite and the bjorken hydro - dynamics ( bhd )  @xcite .",
    "existing @xmath25 data  @xcite cover the energy range @xmath26 gev .",
    "thus , the cbm experiment at the fair accelerator can fill the gap @xmath27 gev .    at transverse momentum @xmath28 cross sections",
    "can be fitted in the central rapidity region by the formula @xmath29 pb / gev@xmath30  @xcite . using this fit",
    "one can estimate the prompt photon spectrum in nucleus - nucleus , a+b , collisions at the impact parameter @xmath31 : @xmath32 , where the nuclear overlapping function is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the average number of binary nn collisions .",
    "nuclear effects ( cronin , shadowing ) are ignored in this approach .",
    "[ fig : prompt ] demonstrates extrapolated yield of prompt photons at fair energies .    for central au+au events ( @xmath35=650 ) at 25 agev one can expect @xmath2 prompt photons with @xmath1 1.5 gev / c . at the beam intensity @xmath3 per second and 1% interaction probability , for 10% of most central collisions",
    "@xmath4 prompt photons per second are expected .",
    "pythia  @xcite simulations agree reasonably with the data extrapolation to fair energies  @xcite . for the prompt photon cross section pythia",
    "predicts : @xmath36 mb , 85% from the process @xmath37 and 15% from @xmath38 .",
    "cross sections for meson rescatterings @xmath17 and @xmath18 evaluated in the theory of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 meson gas  @xcite have been prepared by the itep group  @xcite and implemented by e.bratkovskaya into the hsd code .",
    "the cross sections diverge at a threshold but averaging over the spectral function of the @xmath40 meson solves the problem .",
    "[ fig : wa98data ] shows comparison of hsd predictions with the data of the wa98 collaboration at the sps energy  @xcite .    besides the meson rescatterings",
    ", photons from decays of short - living resonances ( e.g. @xmath6 ) are also taken into account . in the case",
    "when the life time of a resonance is less than characteristic time of the nucleus - nucleus collision it is difficult to reconstruct the resonance because the decay hadron ( @xmath21 ) can reinteract with surrounding medium especially if this medium is dense .",
    "about 10% of @xmath6 decays take place during the dense nuclear matter stage when @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the normal nuclear density ) .",
    "we will assume that it will not be possible to reconstruct these decays .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : wa98data ] one can see that at @xmath230.5 - 1 gev / c the decay photon contribution is comparable with the contribution from @xmath17 .",
    "the model prediction is @xmath12 10 times lower then one can expect from the experimental data .",
    "there are other sources of direct photons as on the hadron ( @xmath20 , ... ) and the quark - gluon ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) levels which are so far not taken into account in the hsd transport code . thus the hsd results can be considered as a lower estimate of data .",
    "photon rapidity densities dn / dy at @xmath0 are 0.38 , 0.26 and 0.17 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . on the same plot",
    "the prompt photon estimation ( see the section  [ promptphotons ] ) is also presented by a line at @xmath1 1.5 gev / c .",
    "[ fig : sisinv ] demonstrates predictions of the hsd code at the fair energy 25 agev for au+au central collisions .",

    "on the same plot the photon spectrum from @xmath21 decays is also shown . in the region",
    "@xmath7 gev / c @xmath8 0.5% .",

    "/ c the part of direct photons is higher @xmath10 2% .",
    "in the bjorken hydrodynamics  @xcite it is assumed that during the ion - ion collision the system is mainly expanding in beam direction in a boost - invariant way .",
    "natural variables are the proper time @xmath46 and rapidity .",
    "thermodynamical variables ( pressure , temperature , ... ) do not depend on the rapidity but are functions of @xmath47 , e.g. @xmath48 for an ideal ultrarelativistic gas .",
    "main initial parameters are the proper time @xmath49 and temperature @xmath11 .",
    "viscosity and conductivity effects are neglected . for",
    "this simple space - time evolution one can evaluate simple formula for photon spectrum with the photon emission rate as input ( the section 2.2.2 of  @xcite ) .",
    "photon yield is proportional to @xmath50 .",
    "though the bjorken scenario is expected to be valid for ultrarelativistic energies ( rhic , lhc ) one can assume it can be used for estimations at sps and fair energies .",

    "the direct photon wa98 data can be reproduced at @xmath1 1.5 gev / c by the bhd model with the parameters @xmath49= 1 fm and @xmath11 = 235 mev  @xcite .",
