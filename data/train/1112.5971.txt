    "<S> specifically , it was recently proposed that the transport and thermodynamic properties of cecoin@xmath0 in the normal phase are controlled by an antiferromagnetic qcp at an inaccessible negative pressure @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , pointing to a field - induced qcp at the zero - temperature upper critical field @xmath7 . however , the location of the field - induced qcp exactly at @xmath7 seems to be just a coincidence , since , with increasing pressure , this qcp moves inside the superconducting dome to lower fields . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , low temperature thermal expansion data @xcite on identification of the quantum critical line can be consistently interpreted within the same set of ideas as the hall effect data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , all these observations seem to favor the antiferromagnetic qcp scenario @xcite . what is important for our discussion , however , is that all the experiments discussed above address the physics of the qcp and superconductivity by extrapolating results obtained in the normal state </S>",
    "<S> . presently , there are no _ direct _ probes of antiferromagnetism and quantum criticality in the superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> this motivated us to study the transport in the mixed state : superconductivity inside the vortex core is suppressed , thus revealing the physics of antiferromagnetism and quantum criticality of an underlying normal state . in this letter we present the results from directly probing the nature of the normal state and quantum criticality under the superconducting dome of cecoin@xmath0 by measuring the vortex core dissipation through current - voltage ( @xmath9-@xmath10 ) characteristics under applied hydrostatic pressure ( @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the vortex core resistivity increases sharply with decreasing temperature ( @xmath12 ) for @xmath13 and magnetic field ( @xmath14 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is greatly suppressed with increasing pressure , due to the suppressed antiferromagnetic ( af ) order inside the vortex core . using our experimental results </S>",

    "<S> these dependences are extracted from the @xmath9-@xmath10 curves ( see supporting online materials for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> first notice that the critical current @xmath20 increases sharply below a certain magnetic field , which we define as the upper critical field ( @xmath24 ) at the given temperature . </S>",
    "<S> when we decrease the value of the external magnetic field , the resistivity @xmath25 first decreases to its minimum value around @xmath26 t ( for @xmath27 k ) and then increases . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior in the mixed state is in sharp contrast with the well known linear relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath14 for low @xmath14 and the saturation of @xmath21 near @xmath24 for a moderately clean superconductor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that when we decrease the magnetic field even further , @xmath21 displays a sharp maximum at @xmath28 t. as discussed later , this maximum is most likely due to the transition from dynamic to static antiferromagnetic order . </S>",

    "<S> all these results show that the vortex core in the mixed state of cecoin@xmath0 is non - metallic while the normal - state behavior ( i.e. above @xmath33 ) is metallic . </S>",

    "<S> in addition , nmr measurements have shown the presence of long range af order inside the vortex core below 290 mk @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we are lead to interpret the observed upturn in the flux - flow resistivity as being due to critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of the boundary separating antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases , i.e. for temperatures near the nel temperature ( @xmath40 ) @xcite . the fact that @xmath21 starts increasing just below the sc boundary ( see top panels of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) suggests that the dynamic af order emerges at the sc phase boundary , but that the static af order appears at lower @xmath14 and @xmath12 , since critical spin fluctuations , which induce the enhancement of resistivity , disappear when the static af order develops . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our results suggest that the system releases the magnetic entropy from the unquenched magnetic moments in the superconducting state and antiferromagnetism becomes complimentary to superconductivity in cecoin@xmath0 .    </S>",

    "<S> in essence , these results provides evidence that the microscopic structure of the superconducting phase in cecoin@xmath0 is highly unusual . </S>",
    "<S> the synergy of magnetism and superconductivity gives rise to a composite superconducting state in which conduction and magnetic degrees of freedom are strongly coupled to each other . </S>",
    "<S> our experiment also shows the potential of the flux - flow measurement technique in probing the subtle features of unconventional superconductivity , in particular , how it competes with other phases , and in providing important insight into the nature of the interplay between quantum criticality , magnetism , and superconductivity in other strongly correlated systems such as iron - pnictides and copper oxides , as long as the pinning strength , and thermal and quantum fluctuations are small ( see supplementary material for details ) .    </S>",
