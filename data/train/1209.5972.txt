    "the availability of free undulator tunnels at the european xfel facility offers a unique opportunity to build a beamline optimized for coherent diffraction imaging of complex molecules , like proteins and other biologically interesting structures .",
    "crucial parameters for such bio - imaging beamline are photon energy range , peak power , and pulse duration @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the highest diffraction signals are achieved at the longest wavelength that supports a given resolution , which should be better 0.3 nm . with photon energy of about 3 kev",
    "one can reach a resolution better than 0.3 nm with a detector designed to collect diffracted light in all forward directions , that is at angles @xmath3 .",
    "higher photon energies up to about 13 kev give access to absorption edges of specific elements used for phasing by anomalous diffraction .",
    "the most useful edges to access are the k - edge of fe ( 7.2 kev ) and se ( 12.6 kev ) , @xcite .",
    "access to the sulfur k - edge ( 2.5 kev ) is required too .",
    "finally , the users of the bio - imaging beamline also wish to investigate large biological structures in the soft x - ray photon energy range down to the water window ( 0.3 kev - 0.5 kev ) , @xcite .",
    "overall , one aims at the production of pulses containing enough photons to produce measurable diffraction patterns , and yet short enough to avoid radiation damage in a single pulse .",
    "this is , in essence , the principle of imaging by `` diffraction before destruction '' @xcite .",
    "these capabilities can be obtained by reducing the pulse duration to @xmath4 fs or less , and simultaneously increasing the peak power to the tw power level or higher , at photon energies between 3 kev and 5 kev , which are optimal for imaging of macromolecular structures @xcite .",
    "the requirements for a dedicated bio - imaging beamline are the following .",
    "the x - ray beam should be delivered in ultrashort pulses with tw peak power and within a very wide photon energy range between 0.3 kev and 13 kev .",
    "the pulse duration should be adjustable from 10 fs in hard x - ray regime to 2 fs - 5 fs in photon energy range between 3 kev and 5 kev . at the european xfel",
    "it will be necessary to run all undulator beamlines at the same electron energy and bunch charge .",
    "however , bio - imaging experiments should be performed without interference with other main sase1 , sase2 beamlines .",
    "this assumes the use of nominal electron energy and electron beam distribution .",
    "a key component of the bio - imaging beamline is the undulator source .",
    "a basic concept for layout and design of the undulator system for a dedicated bio - imaging beamline at the european xfel was proposed in @xcite .",
    "all the requirements in terms of photon beam characteristics can be satisfied by the use a very efficient combination of self - seeding , fresh bunch , and undulator tapering techniques @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a combination of self - seeding and undulator tapering techniques would allow to meet the design tw output power .",
    "the bio - imaging beamline would be equipped with two different self - seeding setups , one provide monochromatization in the soft x - ray range , and one to provide monochromatization in the hard x - ray range .",
    "the most preferable solution in the photon energy range for single biomolecule imaging consists in using a fresh bunch technique in combination with self - seeding and undulator tapering techniques . in @xcite",
    "it was shown how the installation of an additional ( fresh bunch ) magnetic chicane behind the soft x - ray self - seeding setup enables an output power in the tw level for the photon energy range between 3 kev and 5 kev .",
    "additionally , the pulse duration can be tuned between 2 fs and 10 fs with the help of this chicane , still operating with the nominal electron bunch distribution @xcite .    the overall setup proposed in @xcite",
    "is composed of four undulators separated by three magnetic chicanes .",
    "the undulator parts consist of 4,3,4 and 29 cells .",
    "each magnetic chicane compact enough to fit one 5 m - long undulator segment and the fodo lattice will not be perturbed .",
    "the undulator system will be realized in a similar fashion as other european xfel undulators . in order to make use of standard components we favor the use of sase3 type of undulator segments , which are optimized for the generation of soft x - rays .",
    "the present layout of the european xfel enables to accommodate such new beamline .",
    "the previously proposed undulator source provides access to a photon energy range between 3 kev and 5 kev only at the reduced electron beam energy of 10.5 gev .",
    "although the 10.5 gev is one of the nominal electron energy , it may not be the preferable mode of operation for sase1 , sase2 beamline users .",
    "note that the sase3 undulator type would enable operation down to 0.7 kev at an electron energy of 17.5 gev .",
    "however , the delay of photons induced in the grating monochromator ( 3 ps ) and , consequently , the delay of the electrons required in the magnetic chicane of the soft x - ray self - seeding setup sets a limit to the electron energy .",
    "this paper constitutes an update to the scheme proposed in @xcite .",
    "the present design assumes the use of the same 40 cells undulator system , with an improved design of both self - seeding setups . to avoid any interference with other beamlines ,",
    "we propose to extend the photon energy range of the self - seeding setup with a single crystal monochromator down to 3 kev @xcite . as a result",
    ", the design electron energy can be increased up to 17.5 gev in the photon energy range most preferable for bio - imaging .",
    "this is achieved exploiting 0.1 mm diamond crystals in symmetric bragg geometry .",
    "based on the use c(111 ) , c(220 ) , and c(400 ) reflections ( @xmath5-polarization ) it will be possible to cover the photon energy range between 3 kev and 13 kev . in particular , we exploit c(111 ) reflection ( @xmath5-polarization ) in photon energy range between 3 kev and 5 kev .",
    "combination of self - seeding and fresh bunch techniques , as in the case of the original design , has the advantage that the pulse duration can be tuned between 2 fs and 10 fs .",
    "the users of the bio - imaging beamline also wish to investigate their samples around sulfur k - edge , i.e. in the photon energy range between 2 kev and 3 kev .",
    "a solution suitable for this spectral range constitutes a major challenge for self - seeding designers .",
    "in fact , on the one hand crystals with right lattice parameters are difficult to be obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "grating monochromator throughput is usually too low due to high absorption . as for the original design",
    "we propose a method around this obstacle , which is based in essence on a fresh bunch technique , and exploits a self - seeding setup based on grating monochromator in the photon energy range between 0.7 kev and 1 kev .",
    "it should be noted that due to extension of the single crystal monochromator setup down to 3 kev , the maximal photon energy of operation for the grating monochromator is reduced from 1.7 kev in the original design down to 1 kev in the current design .",
    "also , here we adopt an improved design of grating monochromator , which was recently proposed for the soft x - ray self - seeding setup at the lcls @xcite , substituting a previously proposed one @xcite . in this novel design the optical delay",
    "is reduced down to below 1 ps . as a result ,",
    "a self - seeding setup with such grating monochromator allows for reduced constraints on the magnetic chicane , and can operate at the european xfel down to 0.7 kev at the highest nominal electron energy of 17.5 gev .",
    "such high electron energy enables to increase the x - ray output peak power in the most preferable photon energy range for bio - imaging experiments up to 2 tw .",
    "self - seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrow the sase bandwidth and to produce nearly transform - limited x - ray pulses @xcite-@xcite . in its simplest configuration , a self - seeding setup in the hard x - ray regime",
    "consists of two undulators separated by photon monochromator and electron bypass beamline , typically a 4-dipole chicane .",
    "the two undulators are resonant at the same radiation wavelength . the sase radiation generated by the first undulator passes through the narrow - band monochromator , thus generating a transform - limited pulse , which is then used as a coherent seed in the second undulator .",
    "chromatic dispersion effects in the bypass chicane smear out the microbunching in the electron bunch produced by the sase lasing in the first undulator .",
    "electrons and monochromatized photon beam are recombined at the entrance of the second undulator , and the radiation is amplified by the electron bunch in the second undulator , until saturation is reached . the required seed power at the beginning of the second undulator must dominate over the shot noise power within the gain bandpass , which is order of a few kw .    despite the unprecedented increase in peak power of the x - ray pulses for sase x - ray fels ( see e.g. @xcite ) , some applications , including single biomolecule imaging , require still higher photon flux . the most promising way to extract more fel power than that at saturation is by tapering the magnetic field of the undulator @xcite-@xcite . also , a significant increase in power is achievable by starting the fel process from a monochromatic seed rather than from noise @xcite-@xcite .",
    "tapering consists in a slow reduction of the field strength of the undulator in order to preserve the resonance wavelength , while the kinetic energy of the electrons decreases due to the fel process .",
    "the undulator taper could be simply implemented at discrete steps from one undulator segment to the next .",
    "the magnetic field tapering is provided by changing the undulator gap .",
    "the setup suggested in this article constitutes an optimization of the original proposal in @xcite and is composed of five undulator parts separated by four magnetic chicanes as shown in fig .",
    "[ bio3f1 ] .",
    "these undulators consist of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 undulator cells , respectively .",
    "each magnetic chicane is compact enough to fit one undulator segment .",
    "the installation of chicanes does not perturb the undulator focusing system .",
    "the implementation of the self - seeding scheme for soft x - ray would exploit the first magnetic chicane .",
    "the second and third magnetic chicanes create an offset for the installation of a single crystal monochromator or an x - ray mirror delay line , and act as a magnetic delay line .",
    "both self - seeding setups should be compact enough to fit one undulator module .    for soft x - ray self - seeding ,",
    "the monochromator usually consists of a grating @xcite .",
    "recently , a very compact soft x - ray self - seeding scheme has appeared , based on a grating monochromator @xcite .",
    "the proposed monochromator is composed of a toroidal grating followed by three mirrors , and is equipped with an exit slit only .",
    "the delay of the photons is about @xmath10 ps .",
    "the monochromator is continuously tunable in the photon energy range between @xmath11 kev and @xmath10 kev .",
    "the resolution is about @xmath12 .",
    "the transmission of the monochromator beamline is close to @xmath13 .",
    "the magnetic chicane delays the electron electron bunch accordingly , so that the photon beam passing through the monochromator system recombines with the same electron bunch .",
    "the chicane provides a dispersion strength of about @xmath14 mm in order to match the optical delay and also smears out the sase microbunching generated in the first @xmath6 cells of the undulator .",

    "a conventional 4-crystal , fixed exit monochromator introduces optical delay of , at least , a few millimeters , which has to be compensated with the introduction of an electron bypass longer than one undulator module . to avoid this difficulty ,",

    "our solution is based in essence on the fresh bunch technique @xcite and exploits the above described conservative design of self - seeding setup based on a grating monochromator .",
    "the hardware requirement is minimal , and in order to implement a fresh bunch technique it is sufficient to install an additional magnetic chicane at a special position behind the soft x - ray self - seeding setup .",

    "the dispersive strength of the proposed magnetic chicane is more than sufficient to this purpose .",

    ", this potential length respectively amounts to 215 m and 400 m @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the potential length of the xtd4 tunnel is practically the same as the main sase1 and sase2 tunnels , and nicely fits with the undulator system for a dedicated bio - imaging beamline .",
    "it offers thus a great potential for future upgrades of this new beamline .",
    "the bio - imaging beamline would support experiments carried out over a rather wide photon energy range .",
    "it is therefore proposed that the photon beam transport of the new beamline includes two lines .",
    "line a uses @xmath39m - long mirrors operating at a grazing angle of @xmath18 mrad .",
    "this line is dedicated to the transport of x - ray radiation in the photon energy range from @xmath7 kev up to @xmath37 kev .",
    "this would be complementary to the line b that is now optimized in the soft x - ray range between @xmath11 kev and @xmath7 kev .",
    "the distance from the 40-cells - long undulator exit to the first mirror system will be only of about @xmath26 m mrad at @xmath7 kev fel radiation leads to unacceptable mirror length of 2 m due to long distance of about 500 m between the source and mirror system .",
    "for these beamlines there is no possibility to use identical configuration of mirrors within the photon energy range from 3 kev to 13 kev . ] .",
    "the development of self - seeding schemes in the hard x - ray wavelength range necessarily involves crystal monochromators .",
    "any device like a crystal monochromator introduces spatiotemporal deformations of the seeded x - ray pulse , which can be problematic for seeding .",
    "the spatiotemporal coupling in the electric field relevant to self - seeding schemes with crystal monochromators has been analyzed in the frame of classical dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "this analysis shows that a crystal in bragg reflection geometry transforms the incident electric field @xmath40 in the @xmath41 domain into @xmath42 , that is the field of a pulse with a less well - known distortion , first studied in @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of this distortion is that the beam spot size is independent of time , but the beam central position changes as the pulse evolves in time .",
    "here we show in a simple manner that , based on the use only bragg law , we may arrive directly to explanation of spatiotemporal coupling phenomena in the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "let us consider an electromagnetic plane wave in the x - ray frequency range incident on an infinite , perfect crystal . within the kinematical approximation ,",
    "according to the bragg law , constructive interference of waves scattered from the crystal occurs if the angle of incidence , @xmath43 and the wavelength , @xmath44 , are related by the well - known relation    @xmath45    assuming reflection into the first order .",
    "this equation shows that for a given wavelength of the x - ray beam , diffraction is possible only at certain angles determined by the interplanar spacings @xmath46 .",
    "it is important to remember the following geometrical relationships :    \\1 .",
    "the angle between the incident x - ray beam and normal to the reflection plane is equal to that between the normal and the diffracted x - ray beam . in other words ,",
    "bragg reflection is a mirror reflection , and the incident angle is equal to the diffracted angle ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the angle between the diffracted x - ray beam and the transmitted one is always @xmath48 . in other words , incident beam and forward diffracted ( i.e. transmitted ) beam",
    "have the same direction .",
    "we now turn our attention beyond the kinematical approximation to the dynamical theory of x - ray diffraction by a crystal .",
    "an optical element inserted into the x - ray beam is supposed to modify some properties of the beam as its width , its divergence , or its spectral bandwidth .",
    "it is useful to describe the modification of the beam by means of a transfer function .",
    "the transmisivity curve - the transmittance - in bragg geometry can be expressed in the frame of dynamical theory as    @xmath49    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the deviations of frequency and incident angle of the incoming beam from the bragg frequency and bragg angle , respectively .",
    "the frequency @xmath52 and the angle @xmath53 are given by the bragg law : @xmath54 .",
    "here we followed the usual procedure of expanding @xmath55 in a taylor series about @xmath52 , so that    @xmath56    consider now a perfectly collimated , white beam incident on the crystal .",
    "in kinematical approximation @xmath57 is a dirac @xmath58-function , which is simply represented by the differential form of bragg law :    @xmath59    in contrast to this , in dynamical theory the reflectivity width is finite .",
    "this means that there is a reflected beam even when incident angle and wavelength of the incoming beam are not related exactly by bragg equation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the geometrical relationships 1 . and 2 .",
    "are still valid in the framework of dynamical theory .",
    "in particular , reflection in dynamical theory is always a mirror reflection .",
    "we underline here that if we have a perfectly collimated , white incident beam , we also have a perfectly collimated reflected and transmitted beam .",
    "its bandwidth is related with the width of the reflectivity curve .",
    "we will regard the beam as perfectly collimated when the angular spread of the beam is much smaller than the angular width of the transfer function @xmath57 .",
    "it should be realized that the crystal does not introduce an angular dispersion similar to a grating or a prism .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis based on the expression for the reflectivity , eq .",
    "( [ reflectance ] ) , shows that a less well - known spatiotemporal coupling exists . the fact that the reflectivity is invariant under angle and frequency transformations obeying    @xmath60    is evident , and corresponds to the coupling in the fourier domain @xmath61 .",
    "the origin of this relation is kinematical , in the sense that it follows from bragg diffraction .",
    "one might be surprised that the field transformation derived in @xcite for an xfel pulse after a crystal in the @xmath41 domain is given by    @xmath62 = e(x- c t\\cot \\theta_b , t)~ , \\label{eoutxt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath63 indicates a fourier transform from the @xmath64 to the @xmath41 domain , and @xmath65 .",
    "in general , one would indeed expect the transformation to be symmetric in both the @xmath64 and in the @xmath41 domain due to the symmetry of the transfer function domain . while the symmetry is present at the level of the transfer function , it is not present anymore when one considers the incident beam .",
    "we point out that symmetry breaking in @xcite is a result of the approximation of temporal profile of the incident wave to a dirac @xmath58-function . ] .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect the influence of a nonsymmetric input beam distribution . in the self - seeding case ,",
    "the incoming xfel beam is well collimated , meaning that its angular spread is a few times smaller than angular width of the transfer function .",
    "only the bandwidth of the incoming beam is much wider than the bandwidth of the transfer function . in this limit",

    "thus , the spatiotemporal coupling is an issue , and efforts are necessarily required to avoid distortion .",

    "the highest priority for bioimaging experiments at any advanced xfel facility is to establish a dedicated beamline for studying biological objects at the mesoscale , including large macromolecules , macromolecular complexes , and cell organelles .",

    "studies at intermediate resolutions need access to the water window @xcite .",
    "a conceptual design of a dedicated bio - imaging beamline based on the self - seeding scheme developed for european xfel was suggested in @xcite .",
    "the critical attribute of the proposed beamline , compared with the baseline sase1 and sase2 beamlines , is a wider photon energy range that spans from the water window up to the k - edge of selenium ( 12.6 kev ) . with the current design of the european xfel",
    ", the most preferable photon energy range between 3 kev and 5 kev can not be used for biological scattering experiments , but the new proposed beamline could fill this gap operating at those energies with tw peak power .    the first goal in developing a design for a dedicated bio - imaging beamline is to make it satisfying all requirements .",
    "once that is done , the next step is to optimize the design , making it as simple as possible . in order to improve the original design , here we propose to extend the photon energy range of the self - seeding setup with single crystal monochromator to lower photon energies down to 3 kev .",
    "an important aspect of this extension is that the self - seeding scheme with single crystal monochromator is now routinely used in generating of narrow bandwidth x - ray pulses at the lcls @xcite .",
    "it combines a potentially wide photon energy range with a much needed experimental simplicity .",
    "only one x - ray optical element is needed , and no sensitive alignment is required .",
    "the range of applicability of this novel method is a slightly limited , at present , by the availability of a short pulse duration ( of about 10 fs or less ) .",
    "however , this range nicely matches that for single biomolecule imaging .",
    "optimization of the bio - imaging beamline is performed with extensive start - to - end simulations , which also take into account effects such as the spatiotemporal coupling caused by the single crystal monochromator .",
    "one must keep this effect in mind when performing the design of any self - seeding setup .",
    "the spatial shift is proportional to @xmath68 , and is therefore maximal in the range for small bragg angles @xmath53 .",
    "a bragg geometry close to backscattering ( i.e. @xmath53 close to @xmath82 ) would be a more advantageous option from this viewpoint , albeit with a decrease in the spectral tunability @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this distortion is easily suppressed by the right choice of crystals within the photon energy range between 3 kev and 9 kev .",
    "here we propose to use a set of three diamond crystals . for the c(111 ) , the c(220 ) and the c(400 ) bragg reflections ( @xmath5-polarization ) , it will be possible to respectively cover the photon energy ranges 3 kev - 5 kev , 5 kev - 7 kev , and 7 kev - 9 kev . finding a solution suitable for the spectral range between 9 kev and 13 kev is major challenge due to the large value of @xmath68 for the c(400 ) reflection case .",
    "fortunately , even in this case , this obstacle can be overcome by using a fresh bunch technique , and exploiting the self - seeding setup with a c(111 ) single crystal monochromator , which is tunable in the photon energy range around 4 kev , in combination with harmonic generation techniques .",
    "the goal of the present optimized proposal for a dedicated bio - imaging beamline presented here is to aim for experimental simplification and performance improvement .",
    "the design electron energy in the most preferable spectral range 3 kev - 5 kev is increased up to 17.5 gev .",
    "the peak power is shown to reach a maximum value of 2 tw .",
    "the new design takes additional advantage of the fact that 17.5 gev is the most preferable operation energy for the sase1 and the sase2 beamlines .",
    "because of this , the optimized beamline is not sensitive to the parallel operation with other european xfel beamlines .",
