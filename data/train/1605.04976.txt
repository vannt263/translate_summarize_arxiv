    "_ ab initio _ calculations of nuclear structure  @xcite face the challenge of describing a complex , multiscale quantum many - body system .",
    "the goal is to directly solve the many - body problem for a system of protons and neutrons , with realistic internucleon interactions  @xcite .",
    "however , the nucleus is governed by a strong , short - range interaction .",
    "short - range correlations , tightly - bound @xmath1 clusters  @xcite , and weakly - bound halo nucleons  @xcite introduce dynamics over differing length scales and energy scales , within the same nucleus , which must be simultaneously described within the same many - body calculation .",
    "natural orbitals  @xcite provide a means of adapting the single - particle basis to better match the physical structure of the many - body wave function .",
    "natural orbitals are obtained by diagonalizing the one - body density matrix , deduced from a preliminary many - body calculation using an initial reference single - particle basis .",
    "the laguerre function basis  @xcite has been used as the starting point for natural orbitals in atomic electron - structure calculations  @xcite , while we start from the harmonic oscillator orbitals  @xcite more familiar to the nuclear structure context  @xcite .",
    "the natural orbital basis builds in important contributions from high - lying orbitals of the initial basis   for the present application , high - lying oscillator shells   thereby accelerating the convergence of wave functions , energies , and other observables .    in this letter",
    ", we present a framework for _ ab initio _ no - core configuration interaction ( ncci )  @xcite calculations with a natural orbital basis and demonstrate improved convergence for the lightest neutron halo nucleus  @xmath0{he}$ ]  @xcite . when used with recently - proposed infrared ( ir ) basis - extrapolation schemes  @xcite",
    ", we show that natural orbitals provide improved independence of basis parameters for predictions of energy and radius observables .",
    "in ncci calculations , the nuclear many - body schrdinger equation is formulated as a matrix eigenproblem , where the hamiltonian is represented within a basis of slater determinants , _",
    "i.e. _ , antisymmetrized products of single - particle states .",
    "conventionally , harmonic oscillator orbitals  @xcite are used , and the basis is truncated to a maximum allowed number @xmath2 of oscillator excitations  @xcite .",
    "the calculated wave functions , energies , and observables depend upon both the truncation @xmath2 and the oscillator length @xmath3 of the basis ( or , equivalently , the oscillator energy @xmath4 ) .",
    "the solution of the full , untruncated many - body problem could , in principle , be obtained to any desired accuracy , by retaining a sufficiently complete basis set .",
    "however , the dimension of the ncci problem increases rapidly with the number of nucleons and included single - particle excitations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dimension ] .",
    "currently available computational resources therefore limit the convergence of calculated states and observables  @xcite .",
    "we therefore seek a physically - adapted basis , in which the nuclear many - body wave function can be efficiently and accurately described , subject to the constraint of accessible problem dimensions .",
    "the _ natural orbital _",
    "basis minimizes the mean occupation of states above the fermi surface  @xcite , thus reducing the contribution of high - lying orbitals in describing the many - body wave function .",
    "intuitively , the natural orbitals may be understood as representing an attempt to recover the basis in which the many - body wave function most resembles a single slater determinant . although we can not expect to reduce the complex , highly - correlated nuclear wave function to a single slater determinant , as assumed in the hartree - fock approximation",
    ", we may expect that transforming to a more natural single - particle basis could enhance the role of a comparatively small set of dominant slater determinants , and thereby accelerate convergence within a slater determinant expansion .",
    "an ncci state of good total angular momentum can only , in general , be obtained as a superposition of several slater determinants of @xmath5 single particle states ( here , @xmath6 is the radial quantum number , @xmath7 labels the orbital angular momentum , @xmath8 labels the resultant angular momentum after coupling to the spin , and @xmath9 labels its projection ) .",
    "therefore , we can not , in general , expect the nuclear eigenfunctions to resemble a single slater determinant .",
    "rather , we hope to recover wave functions which most resemble a single _ configuration _ of nucleons over @xmath10 orbitals . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the _",
    "scalar densities _",
    "@xmath11_{00}}{\\psi}$ ] , where @xmath12 represents the creation operator for a nucleon in orbital @xmath13 and the brackets @xmath14_{00}$ ] represent spherical tensor coupling to zero angular momentum . for a single configuration @xmath15 ,",
    "the scalar densities are diagonal , and the diagonal entries give the occupations of the contributing orbitals [ @xmath16  @xcite . otherwise , for the general case of a many - body state @xmath15 , natural orbitals are defined by diagonalizing this scalar density matrix .",
    "the scalar density matrix only connects orbitals of the same @xmath7 and @xmath8 , _ i.e. _ , differing at most in their radial quantum number @xmath6 , so the transformation to natural orbitals induces a change of basis on the radial functions separately within each @xmath17 space [ @xmath18 .",
    "an initial ncci calculation is carried out in the oscillator basis .",
    "this provides a scalar density matrix for the ground - state wave function , which is then diagonalized to yield the natural orbitals .",
    "the eigenvalue associated with a natural orbital represents its mean occupation in the many - body wave function .",
    "we order the natural orbitals by decreasing eigenvalue of the density matrix  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , starting with @xmath19 for the natural orbital with highest eigenvalue [ @xmath20 , thereby providing an @xmath6 quantum number for an @xmath2-type truncation scheme ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the lowest @xmath21 natural orbital obtained from the @xmath0{he}$ ] ground - state one - body densities is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - radial ] , taking an example from the ncci calculations presented below . in a traditional shell - model description , @xmath0{he}$ ]",
    "consists of two protons and two neutrons in a filled @xmath22 shell ( @xmath23 ) , plus two neutrons in the valence @xmath24 shell ( @xmath25 ) . in the oscillator - basis ncci calculations ,",
    "this general structure is reflected in a nearly - filled @xmath22 shell .",
    "the next most heavily occupied orbital is then the neutron @xmath26 .",
    "we observe that the corresponding natural orbital [ fig .",
    "[ fig - radial ] ] receives extended contributions from high - lying oscillator shells and thus acquires a substantial large-@xmath27 tail compared to the oscillator orbital , as may be expected for a weakly - bound halo nucleon .",
    "the ncci calculation using the natural orbital basis is no more computationally difficult than the original oscillator basis calculation . it is simply necessary , in preparation , to carry out a similarity transformation of the input hamiltonian , as described in refs .",
    "several experimental properties of the ground state of @xmath0{he}$ ] support the interpretation that it consists of a weakly - bound two - neutron halo surrounding a tightly - bound @xmath1 core  @xcite .",
    "the two - neutron separation energy for @xmath0{he}$ ] is only @xmath28 , out of a total binding energy of @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the onset of halo structure along the @xmath30 isotopic chain is indicated by a jump in the measured charge and matter radii , from @xmath31{he}$ ] to @xmath0{he}$ ] .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) point - proton distribution radius @xmath32 , which may be deduced  @xcite from the measured charge radius , increases by @xmath33 from @xmath31{he}$ ] [ @xmath34 to @xmath0{he}$ ] [ @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "this increase may be understood as a consequence of halo structure , arising from the recoil of the charged @xmath1 core against the halo neutrons ( as well as possible contributions from swelling of the @xmath1 core  @xcite ) .",
    "the initial oscillator basis ncci calculations from which we derive natural orbitals for @xmath0{he}$ ] cover a range of oscillator basis parameters @xmath36 to @xmath37 with truncations @xmath38 , as considered in ref .",
    "the ncci calculations are carried out using the code mfdn  @xcite , with the jisp16 two - body internucleon interaction  @xcite plus coulomb interaction .",
    "the ground state energy eigenvalues obtained for @xmath0{he}$ ] using the harmonic oscillator ( dashed lines ) and natural orbital ( solid lines ) bases are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig - scan](a ) .",
    "the energies from the natural orbital calculations are lower ( thus , by the variational principle , closer to the true value ) than those from the harmonic oscillator calculations and are also less dependent upon @xmath39 .",
    "the improvement in convergence afforded by the natural orbitals ranges from approximately one step in @xmath2 in the vicinity of the variational minimum ( @xmath40 ) to several steps in @xmath2 towards the ends of the calculated @xmath39 range  @xcite .    for the @xmath0{he}$ ]",
    "proton radius , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - scan](b ) , the natural orbital basis ncci calculations lead the harmonic oscillator basis calculations in convergence by more than one step in @xmath2 at @xmath41 and by several steps in @xmath2 at the high end of the @xmath39 range .",
    "these radii obtained from the natural orbital calculations are also less dependent upon @xmath39 than those obtained from the harmonic oscillator calculations .",
    "the goal we set out to achieve is to find the true results for observables as they would be obtained in the full , infinite - dimensional space .",
    "although full convergence is not achieved , even with the natural orbitals , the improved convergence motivates us to attempt to obtain estimates of the converged results via basis extrapolation methods  @xcite .",
    "infrared extrapolation schemes  @xcite are based on the premise that the solution of the many - body problem in a truncated space effectively imposes infrared ( long - range ) and ultraviolet ( short - range ) cutoffs . for bases with high enough @xmath39 ( and @xmath2 ) ultraviolet convergence",
    "is assumed , and any remaining incomplete convergence is attributed to the failure of the basis to reproduce the long - range tail of the many - body wave function .",
    "a basis consisting of harmonic oscillator orbitals with no more than @xmath42 quanta can not fully resolve long - range physics beyond the classical turning point @xmath43^{1/2}\\,b({{\\hbar\\omega}})$ ]  @xcite , where @xmath44^{1/2}$ ] is again the oscillator length , with @xmath45 the nucleon mass .",
    "the calculated energy and observables are expected to depend only on this cutoff @xmath46 , approaching the true converged values as @xmath47 . for energy eigenvalues , it is expected that  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are to be deduced as fitting parameters from the results of calculations in truncated spaces . taking @xmath47 , we extract @xmath49 as an estimate for the true energy . for mean square radii",
    ", it is expected that , letting @xmath52 , @xmath53 , \\label{eqn - rsqr - ir}\\ ] ] for @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are similarly deduced from calculations in truncated spaces , and @xmath55 provides an estimate of the true rms radius .    the extrapolated values for the @xmath0{he}$ ] ground state energy and proton radius",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - extrap ] . we restrict ourselves to a straightforward application of  ( [ eqn - e - ir ] ) and  ( [ eqn - rsqr - ir ] ) , based on three - point extrapolation in @xmath2 at fixed @xmath39 .",
    "calculations at low @xmath39 may not provide the assumed ultraviolet convergence , while poor infrared convergence at high @xmath39 leads to an excessively large correction and thus poor extrapolation .    the extrapolated @xmath0{he}$ ] ground state energies from the natural orbital ncci calculations [ fig .",
    "[ fig - extrap](b ) ] are considerably less @xmath39-dependent than the extrapolated energies from the harmonic oscillator ncci calculations [ fig .",
    "[ fig - extrap](a ) ] .",
    "the extrapolations obtained for different @xmath2 are also considerably more consistent ( in the figure , @xmath2 refers to the highest @xmath2 in the three - point extrapolation ) .",
    "the extrapolated ground state energies obtained with the harmonic oscillator and natural orbital bases at @xmath58 ( chosen close to the variational energy minimum ) and @xmath59 are consistent with each other to within their respective variations , giving @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "once the many - body calculation is under control , any remaining deviation of calculated values from nature may be attributed to deficiencies in the internucleon interaction . comparing to the experimental binding energy of @xmath29",
    "thus indicates that the jisp16 interaction underbinds @xmath0{he}$ ] by @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "( for comparison , the binding of @xmath31{he}$ ] obtained with jisp16 matches experiment to within @xmath63  @xcite . )    the extrapolated proton radii extracted from the ncci calculations with the natural orbital basis [ fig .",
    "[ fig - extrap](d ) ] similarly demonstrate a reduced @xmath39 dependence and @xmath2 dependence , as compared to the extrapolations from the oscillator - basis calculations [ fig .",
    "[ fig - extrap](c ) ] . at the highest calculated @xmath2 ( @xmath59 ) ,",
    "the extrapolated @xmath32 varies only by @xmath64 across the range of @xmath39 values shown ( @xmath65 to @xmath37 ) , and the @xmath2 dependence is comparable . we must emphasize that the variations in extrapolated values at best provide a rough guide to how well we can trust these extrapolated values as reflecting the true radius which would be obtained in an untruncated many - body calculation .",
    "nonetheless , the @xmath39-independence and @xmath2-independence of the calculations at the @xmath64 level is reassuring .    taking the extrapolated proton radius at @xmath58 and @xmath59 as representative gives @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "thus , it would appear that the _ ab initio _ ncci calculations with the jisp16 interaction , while qualitatively reproducing the increase in proton radius with the onset of halo structure in @xmath0{he}$ ] , do yield a quantitative shortfall of @xmath67 ( or @xmath68 ) for the proton radius of @xmath0{he}$ ] .",
    "describing the nuclear many - body wave function within truncated spaces is challenging due to the need to describe , simultaneously , long - range asymptotics and short - range correlations .",
    "natural orbitals , obtained here by diagonalizing one - body density matrices from initial ncci calculations using the harmonic oscillator basis , build in contributions from high - lying oscillator shells , thus accelerating convergence .    in the present application to the halo nucleus @xmath0{he}$ ] ,",
    "improvement is by about one step in @xmath2 near the variational minimum in @xmath39 , and significantly more for other @xmath39 values ( fig .",
    "[ fig - scan ] ) . to put these gains in perspective",
    ", we note that an increment in @xmath2 results in an increase in matrix dimension of about a factor of @xmath69@xmath70 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - dimension ] , with much larger increase in the computational costs  @xcite .",
    "although full convergence is still not achieved , the calculations using natural orbitals provide improved basis parameter independence for extrapolations with respect to the infrared cutoff of the basis ( fig .",
    "[ fig - extrap ] ) .    the successful application of natural orbitals to _ ab initio _ nuclear ncci calculations presented here provide a starting point for exploring ideas ( some taken from electron structure theory ) which may more fully realize the potential of the natural orbital approach :    ( 1 )  ncci calculations based on natural orbitals yield improved one - body densities which can , in turn , be diagonalized to yield new natural orbitals .",
    "natural orbitals constructed through such an iterative method can rapidly build in additional contributions from high - lying shells , thereby potentially further accelerating convergence  @xcite .",
    "( 2 )  an improved reference basis for the initial ncci calculation may also boost the convergence of the subsequent natural orbital calculations . for instance , the laguerre functions , commonly used as the starting point for natural orbitals in electron - structure calculations , also have the correct exponential asymptotics for nucleons bound by a finite - range potential .",
    "( 3 )  the structure of nuclear excited states can vary markedly from that of the ground state .",
    "natural orbitals constructed by diagonalizing the density matrices from excited states , rather than from the ground state , may more effectively accelerate convergence of those excited states  @xcite .",
    "( 4 )  finally , natural orbitals are conducive to a more efficient many - body truncation scheme than the conventional oscillator @xmath2 scheme .",
    "the eigenvalues associated with the natural orbitals , by providing an estimate of the mean occupation of each orbital in the many - body wave function , also suggest a means of estimating the relative importance of slater determinants involving these orbitals .",
