    "turbulent flows are often forced in an anisotropic fashion .",
    "the anisotropy has a significant effect on a variety of measured turbulence characteristics .",
    "we are interested in the effect of anisotropy on statistical quantities , especially the low - order structure functions of velocity differences across a scale @xmath1 . in perfectly isotropic systems such objects",
    "are expected to display pure scaling behavior in the limit of high reynolds number .",
    "we have suggested recently @xcite that in the presence of anisotropy , the structure functions are no longer pure power laws .",
    "instead , components of the structure functions that belong to different irreducible representations ( sectors ) of the so(@xmath2 ) group possess different scaling exponents .",
    "each of these sectors is characterized by the angular momentum indices @xmath0 and @xmath3 . by projecting the structure function onto the different sectors",
    ", we could measure @xcite the universal scaling exponents in each sector separately .",
    "the spectrum of anisotropic exponents is particularly accessible in _ linear _ problems like passive scalar @xcite and passively advected magnetic fields @xcite . in both the models , the equations of motion",
    "are isotropic and as a result the existence of universal anisotropic exponents can be proven @xcite .",
    "additionally the isotropy of the equations implies that the scaling exponents depend on @xmath0 but not on @xmath3 .",
    "one of the important results of the analysis is that the discrete spectrum of anisotropic exponents is strictly increasing as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this explains the isotropization of the statistics as smaller and smaller scales are observed .",
    "since the scaling exponents @xmath4 appear in power laws of the type @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being some typical outer scale and @xmath7 , the larger is the exponent , the faster is the decay of the contribution as the scale @xmath1 diminishes .",
    "therefore the gap between the leading , isotropic exponent , and the next available exponent governs the rate of isotropization .",
    "experiments and simulations on navier - stokes ( ns ) turbulence also indicate that anisotropic sectors possess larger scaling exponents than the isotropic sector @xcite .",
    "however , to date , the exponents for @xmath8 were not determined with sufficient accuracy .",
    "we thus do not know whether the higher sectors are characterized by an ever increasing exponents , or whether the exponents _ saturate_. this issue is theoretically puzzling because of the effects of pressure .",
    "the inversion of the pressure in terms of the green s function of the laplacian operator introduces integrals over the domain of turbulence .",
    "these integrals manifest the nonlocality of the problem , and are present in both the dynamical equation , and in the equations for the correlation functions . when considering a spatially homogeneous turbulence ,",
    "the turbulent domain is usually taken to be infinite .",
    "the physical boundary conditions at scale @xmath6 , are mimicked by employing a homogeneous forcing that acts at that scale . in this case , the integrals that result from the pressure term are over all @xmath9 , and their convergence has to be guaranteed .",
    "the question that we want to address in this paper is the following : does the requirement of the convergence of the integrals necessarily bound the spectrum of the scaling exponents from above ?",
    "since the correlation functions appear in the integrand , an unbounded spectrum implies a rapidly increasing integrand as a function of the length scale . on the face of it , at some point the integrals must diverge in the infrared .",
    "it would appear therefore that either there must be a limit to the magnitude of the scaling exponents , or that the integrals converge due to an infrared crossover in the correlation functions .",
    "the latter scenario looks physically reasonable , yet in the presence of pressure integrals , seems to break scale invariance in the inertial range . to demonstrate that , consider a typical integral term of the form , @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the infinite domain green function of the laplacian operator , and @xmath12 is some statistical object , which is expected to be scale invariant in the inertial range .",
    "if @xmath12 has an infrared crossover at scale @xmath6 ( or equivalently , the integral has an infrared cutoff at scale @xmath6 ) , then the above expression will not be a pure power law of @xmath13 , not even inside the inertial range .",
    "then how is it possible that such an expression will cancel out a local term of @xmath12 , as is required by the typical equations of motion ?",
    "this puzzle has led in the past to the introduction of the concept of `` window of locality '' @xcite .",
    "the window of locality is the range for the scaling exponents in which no divergence occurs , even if the crossover length @xmath6 is taken to infinity .",
    "for these exponents , integrals of type ( [ eq : ex ] ) are dominated by the range of integration @xmath14 and are therefore termed  local \" . in a ",
    "local \" theory no infrared cutoff is called for .    in this paper",
    "we show that scaling behavior of the correlation functions together with finite integrals over an infinite domain _ do not _ necessarily imply a bounded spectrum of anisotropic exponents .",
    "our strategy in this paper is to come up with a tractable example of a _ linear _ model with pressure , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : v - p ] ) .",
    "we refer to this model as the  linear pressure model \" .",
    "we approach the solutions of this model in two steps .",
    "first we distill yet another , simpler , exactly solvable model , which still poses the riddle of the navier - stokes problem .",
    "the exact solution reveals that the spectrum of scaling exponents is unbounded , and the convergence of the integrals is nevertheless not compromised . in the second step",
    "we find the scaling exponents of the  zero modes \" @xcite of the linear pressure model , and use the conclusions of the simpler model to relate them to the full solution .",
    "we show that also in this case the spectrum does not saturate in the anisotropic sectors .",
    "the linear pressure model and its simplified version reveal two mechanisms that allow an unbounded spectrum of scaling exponents .",
    "first , a careful analysis of the window of locality in the anisotropic sectors shows that it widens as @xmath0 increases .",
    "we always have a leading scaling exponent within the window of locality .",
    "second , there is a more subtle mechanism that comes to play when subleading exponents exist outside the window of locality . in these cases",
    "we show that there exist counter - terms in the exact solution ( not the zero modes ! ) that maintain the locality of the integrals .",
    "the bottom line is that in these models the anisotropic exponents are unbounded from above leading to a fast decay of the anisotropic contributions in the inertial range .    in sec .",

    "the linear pressure model captures some of the aspects of the pressure term in navier - stokes turbulence , while being a linear and therefore , much simpler problem .",

    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the forcing @xmath20 is also taken to be a gaussian white noise process .",
    "its correlation function is @xmath23 the forcing is responsible for injecting energy and anisotropy to the system at an outer scale @xmath6 .",
    "we choose the tensor function @xmath24 to be analytic in @xmath25 , anisotropic , and vanishing rapidly for @xmath26 .",
    "analyticity is an important requirement .",
    "it means that @xmath24 can be expanded for small @xmath27 as a power series in @xmath28 ; as a result its leading contribution in the @xmath0 sector is proportional to @xmath29 , given by @xmath30 . to see that this is the leading contribution the reader can consult the general discussion of the construction of the irreducible representations in ref.@xcite .",
    "all other analytic contributions contain less derivatives and are therefore of higher order in @xmath31 .",
    " in order to derive the statistical equations of the correlation function of @xmath32 , we need a version of eq .",

    "( [ eq : t - definition ] ) . indeed , the vexing problem that we face is being made very clear : if the triple correlation function has a power law dependence on @xmath46 with an arbitrarily large exponent , how can the integral converge in the infrared ?",
    "one possibility is that the scaling exponent of @xmath41 is sufficiently low , making the integral convergent .",
    "the other possibility is that the correlation function is scale invariant only in the inertial range and vanishes quickly after that , which is equivalent to the introduction of an infrared cutoff .",
    "however , the integral terms in the equation probe the correlation function throughout the entire space .",
    "therefore , a crossover behavior of the correlation function at the outer scale @xmath6 , seems to contradict a pure scaling behavior of the correlation function in the inertial range itself .",
    "this in turn implies the saturation of the anisotropic scaling exponents .",
    "to proceed , we use the fact that the field @xmath15 , as well as the forcing , are gaussian white noises .",
