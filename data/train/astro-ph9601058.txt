    "the detection of large angular scale anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation was first reported by the _ cobe_-dmr experiment in 1992 ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ; bennett et al .",
    "1992 ; wright et al . 1992 ; kogut et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the initial detection was based only on the first year of flight data . since that time",
    "the dmr team processed and analyzed the first two years of data and found results to be consistent with the first year results ( bennett et al .",
    "1994 , grski et al .",
    "1994 , wright et al .",
    "we have now processed and analyzed the full 4-years of dmr observations : this paper is one of a series describing the results of our analysis .",
    "the maps and an overview of the scientific results are given in bennett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "in this paper we analyze the angular power spectrum of the 4-year dmr maps using a pixel based likelihood technique which was first applied to the 2-year data by tegmark & bunn ( 1995 ) .",
    "we extend previous work by considering several parameterization of the angular power spectrum .",
    "the simplest model for large angular scale anisotropy is the power - law model parameterized by a normalization , @xmath4 , and spectral index , @xmath5 .",
    "it is of interest to separate the quadrupole anisotropy from the rest of the power spectrum since it is most plausibly contaminated by galactic emission , and , in some models , is predicted to deviate from the simple power - law form .",
    "we extend our likelihood analysis to a three parameter model in which the quadrupole is fit independent of the higher - order power ( which is assumed to follow a power - law , see  4 for details ) .",
    "lastly we consider band power estimates in which the anisotropy is assumed to be scale - invariant in each of four modestly narrow @xmath6 bands , chosen to have roughly comparable sensitivity .",
    "the results are compared to the power - law fits and indicate that the anisotropy has no significant deviation from a power - law form .",
    "the dmr experiment has produced two independent microwave maps ( a and b ) at each of 3 frequencies ( 31.5 , 53 and 90 ghz ) .",
    "the results presented here are based on linear combinations of all 6 channel maps .",
    "the combination coefficients are dictated by the sensitivities of the individual channels and on considerations of galactic foreground removal .",
    "kogut et al .",
    "( 1996a,1996b ) have revisited the question of galactic emission in the 2- and 4-year dmr data at high latitudes , and conclude that there is statistically significant evidence for a weak galactic signal at all three frequencies , even at latitudes @xmath7 .",
    "thus , for the 4-year analysis , we take a more aggressive approach to galactic foreground removal than we have previously : first , we extend the galactic plane cut of @xmath8 with additional cuts , guided by the @xmath9-dirbe 140 @xmath1 m map ( bennett et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the number of pixels surviving the cut is 3881 in galactic coordinates .",
    "second , we model and remove residual high - latitude galactic emission in two complementary ways , described below . in all , we analyze three separate maps in this paper : the first map is a weighted average of all six dmr channel maps with no residual galaxy emission subtracted .",
    "we denote this map ",
    "31 + 53 + 90 \" .",
    "the second is the same weighted average map as the first with best - fit galaxy template maps subtracted from each channel prior to averaging ( kogut et al .",
    "we denote this the  correlation \" model map .",
    "the third is a linear combination of all six channels with coefficients designed to maximize sensitivity subject to the constraint that any signal with a free - free frequency spectrum ( @xmath10 ) cancels .",
    "this map also has best - fit synchrotron and dust emission templates subtracted prior to averaging ( kogut et al .",
    "we denote this the  combination \" model map .",
    "the specific coefficients used to construct these maps are given in table 1 of hinshaw et al .",
    "in all the analyses below we use the maps pixelized in galactic coordinates .",
    "grski et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and banday et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have analyzed both the galactic and ecliptic maps in detail . since our results for the galactic maps are in agreement with theirs , where comparable , we defer to those papers for a comparison of the galactic and ecliptic maps .",
    "most cosmological models make predictions for the mean angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies , the coefficients , @xmath11 . for a rotationally invariant theory , the @xmath11 specify the expected variance in each spherical harmonic mode in a fourier expansion of the sky temperature @xmath12 with @xmath13 . for a given power spectrum , @xmath11 , the implied covariance between map pixels @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the temperature in pixel @xmath14 of a map , the angled brackets denote a universal ensemble average , @xmath18 is the experimental window function that includes the effects of beam smoothing and finite pixel size , @xmath11 is the power spectrum , @xmath19 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath6 , and @xmath20 is the unit vector towards the center of pixel @xmath14 . for gaussian fluctuations ,",
    "the covariance matrix fully specifies the statistics of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "the probability of observing a map with pixel temperatures @xmath21 , given a power spectrum @xmath11 , is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of pixels in the map . assuming a uniform prior distribution of cosmological model parameters , the probability of a power spectrum @xmath11 , given a map @xmath21 , is then @xmath24    in the following section , we evaluate the above likelihood function using three different parameterizations of the power spectrum , @xmath11 . to test the effects of data selection and galaxy modeling ,",
    "we analyze three separate dmr maps , as specified in  2 . to make the analysis computationally efficient , we have degraded the maps by one step in pixel resolution ( to index level 5 ) for which there are 1536 pixels in the full sky , and 954 pixels surviving the extended galaxy cut .",
    "we account for the effects of smoothing due to pixelization by including a term in the window function : @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 are the legendre coefficients of the dmr beam pattern , tabulated by wright et al .",
    "( 1994b ) .",
    "the @xmath27 are the legendre coefficients for a circular top - hat function with area equal to the pixel area .",
    "the coefficients for index level 5 pixels are available on request .",
    "we ignore the contribution of the monopole and dipole moments in the maps since these modes are either unconstrained by the data ( the monopole ) , or are dominated by local effects ( the dipole ) . in principle , this is achieved by integrating the likelihood over the modes @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; in practice , we set these terms to large positive constants when evaluating the covariance matrix .",
    "we have found that setting @xmath30 @xmath1k@xmath31 renders the likelihood insensitive to monopole and dipole moments of several hundred @xmath1k , without compromising the inversion of the covariance matrices .",
    "( note that the analyzed maps have approximately zero mean , by construction , and approximately zero dipole since an estimate of the cmb dipole is removed during the raw data processing . )",
    "we assume the noise in the sky maps is uncorrelated from pixel to pixel ( lineweaver et al .",
    "1994 ) , which adds a diagonal contribution to the pixel covariance matrix in equation [ cov_eq ] .",
    "tegmark & bunn ( 1995 ) have shown the assumption of uncorrelated noise to be an excellent approximation for this application .",
    "the noise per pixel is derived from the noise per observation , given in table 1 of bennett et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and the number of observations per pixel .",
    "we consider three parameterizations of the angular power spectrum .",
    "first , we adopt the power - law model , parameterized by the amplitude of the mean quadrupole anisotropy , @xmath4 , and the power - law spectral index @xmath5 .",
    "specifically ( bond & efstathiou , 1987 ) @xmath32 this model is extended to study the quadrupole anisotropy by parameterizing the power at @xmath6 = 2 separately @xmath33 the most - likely value of @xmath34 that results from this model is closely related to the quadrupole anisotropy observed in our sky , which we denote @xmath35 ; the precise connection is discussed below .",
    "note also that the power - law parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , inferred from this model are essentially the same as those derived from marginalizing over @xmath34 since they are only weakly coupled to @xmath34 .",
    "lastly , we study a model in which the spectrum is taken to be scale - invariant in each of four relatively narrow @xmath6 bands , and let the amplitude in each be a free parameter @xmath36 note that within each band , the amplitude parameters @xmath37 correspond to @xmath38 as defined by scott , silk & white ( 1995 ) .",
    "the spectral band widths were chosen to give roughly equal sensitivity in each band except the highest which suffers loss of signal due to the @xmath39 beam width .",
    "the model is designed to probe for deviations from a power - law while maintaining computational feasibility .",
    "the fits to power - law spectra , including the quadrupole in the analysis , are summarized in table [ qn_table ] .",
    "the results are generally consistent with the 2-year data .",
    "the overall normalization is slightly smaller due to the additional galactic cutting and modeling .",
    "the most - likely spectral index is slightly greater than unity , while the quadrupole normalization for a scale - invariant spectrum ranges from 17.2 to 18.4 @xmath1k , depending on galactic model . for comparison ,",
    "the scale - invariant normalization derived from the weighted average map using a straight @xmath8 cut with no additional galactic modeling is 20.1 @xmath1k , 1.6 @xmath1k higher than we obtain with the extended cut , and comparable to the normalization quoted by grski et al . ( 1994 ) for the 2-year data ( using a straight cut ) . in assessing the results obtained from the three maps , we note that the dirbe 140 @xmath1 m map appears to trace the bulk of the free - free emission seen by dmr ( kogut et al .",
    "1996b ) , and since the correlation map is more sensitive than the combination map , we give it more weight in our conclusions . taken together , the results in table 1 are consistent with a spectral index of 1.2 @xmath2 0.3 and a scale - invariant quadrupole normalization of 18 @xmath2 1.4 @xmath1k .",
    "the fits to power - law spectra with the quadrupole parameterized independently are summarized in table [ q2qn_table ] .",
    "the first three columns summarize the power - law portion of the spectrum in the same format as table [ qn_table ] .",
    "these results are based on slicing the 3-dimensional likelihood at the maximum likelihood value for @xmath34 , but the results are only weakly dependent on @xmath34 and thus are effectively equivalent to standard power - law fits that ignore the quadrupole .",
    "the last column of table [ q2qn_table ] gives the 68% confidence interval for @xmath34 expressed in terms of @xmath40 .",
    "the mode gives a self - consistent estimate of the quadrupole moment observed in our sky , while the confidence range accounts for both instrument noise _ and _ cosmic variance .",
    "a complimentary approach to analyzing the quadrupole , based on fitting and squaring @xmath41 coefficients ( kogut et al .",
    "1996b ) gives consistent results , after accounting for the bias introduced by uncertainties in the @xmath41 .",
    "this approach demonstrates the importance of modeling the residual galactic foreground emission since it contributes significantly to the quadrupole emission . as with previous analyses ,",
    "the observed quadrupole is smaller than that expected from the power - law fits : the most - likely amplitude ranges from 6.9 to 10.0 @xmath1k depending on galaxy model .",
    "figure [ q2_like_fig ] shows the full likelihood for @xmath35 for each map analyzed .",
    "it is important to stress that while the quadrupole in our sky is most likely @xmath4210 @xmath1k , the cosmic variance combined with experimental uncertainties are so large that its value is easily consistent with a power - law model of anisotropy .",
    "for example , the likelihood for @xmath35 derived from the correlation map implies there is a 22% chance that @xmath35 exceeds 18 @xmath1k , the value favored in a scale - invariant power - law model .",
    "the band power fits are summarized in table [ band_table ] , and are plotted in figure [ band_fig ] .",
    "the vertical uncertainties in the figure indicate the extent of the 68% confidence interval in each band power parameter when the other 3 are fixed at their maximum likelihood value .",
    "these uncertainties include both instrument noise and cosmic variance .",
    "the horizontal errors bars represent the extent of each band , as defined in equation [ band_model_eq ] .",
    "the covariance between bands , which arises from the galaxy cut and from non - uniform sky coverage , is quite small : roughly 10% of the parameter variance for neighboring bands , and less for non - neighboring bands .",
    "note that each of the three lowest bands have consistently significant detections of power , while , in all cases , the highest band , from 21 to 40 , does not .",
    "thus , we only plot 95% confidence upper limits for this band . to compare the band power fits to the power - law",
    "fits we have also plotted the 68% confidence locus of acceptable power - law models in figure [ band_fig ] .",
    "more precisely , the dashed white line in the figure is the mean power spectrum for the most - likely power - law model , while the grey band represents the locus of mean power spectra within the 68% confidence region in the ( @xmath43 ) plane .",
    "the general agreement between the power - law model and the band power model is an indication that there are no significant wide band deviations ( with @xmath44 a few ) from a simple power - law in the low-@xmath6 anisotropy spectrum .",
    "the band power amplitude in the highest @xmath6 band we probe is consistently low , but this estimate is rather sensitive to the details of the beam and pixelization filters , and to the level of noise in the maps , so the uncertainty attached to this estimate is quite large . to date , two other experiments have measured anisotropy on angular scales probed by the dmr : firs ( ganga et al .",
    "1994 ) and tenerife ( hancock et al .",
    "both experiments report significant detections of anisotropy : the firs team quotes @xmath38 = 19 @xmath2 5 @xmath1k for @xmath45 , while the tenerife team quotes @xmath38 = 26 @xmath2 6 @xmath1k for @xmath46 , both of which are consistent with dmr .",
    "we have estimated various parameterizations of the angular power spectrum in the _ cobe_-dmr 4-year sky maps .",
    "we find the results to be generally consistent with the first and second year results .",
    "the data are consistent with a scale - invariant spectrum with a quadrupole normalization of 18 @xmath2 1.4 @xmath1k , and a best - fit spectral index of 1.2 @xmath2 0.3 .",
    "the quadrupole anisotropy is somewhat smaller than the best - fit power - law spectrum would prefer , but the discrepancy is not statistically significant when we take account of galactic modeling uncertainties , instrument noise , and cosmic variance . we have further analyzed the spectrum in each of four @xmath6 bands and find no evidence for significant , wide - band deviations from a simple power - law form .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the many people who made this paper possible : the nasa office of space sciences , the _ cobe _ flight operations team , and all of those who helped process and analyze the data .",
    "we also thank charley lineweaver for useful comments on our manuscript .",
