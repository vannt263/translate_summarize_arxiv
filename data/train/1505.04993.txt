    "when a given a heegaard splitting is stabilized , we can define the _ primitive disk complex _ for the splitting , which is the full subcomplex of the disk complex for a handlebody in the splitting spanned by the vertices represented by the primitive disks in the handlebody .",
    "strictly speaking , for each stabilized heegaard splitting , there are exactly two primitive disk complexes depending on the choice of a handlebody of the splitting . however , for all the heegaard splittings we will consider in this paper , the two primitive disk complexes are isomorphic .",

    "is well understood from the works @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they are both contractible , and further the complex for the @xmath0-sphere is @xmath7-dimensional and deformation retracts to a tree in its barycentric subdivision , while the complex for @xmath5 itself is a tree . in @xcite , the structure of the primitive disk complex for the genus-@xmath7 splitting of the lens space @xmath8 was fully studied .",
    "in addition , a generalized version of a primitive disk complex is also studied in @xcite for a genus-@xmath7 handlebody embedded in the @xmath0-sphere . in this work , including the case of @xmath8 , we describe the structure of the primitive disk complex for the genus-@xmath7 splitting in detail for every lens space .",
    "an interesting fact is that not all lens spaces admit connected primitive disk complexes for their genus-@xmath7 splitting . in section [ sec : the_structure_of_primitive_disk_complexes ]",
    ", we find all lens spaces having connected primitive disk complexes for their genus-@xmath7 splittings ( theorem [ thm : contractible ] ) , and then describe the structure of the complex for each lens spaces ( theorem [ thm : structure ] ) .",

    "when a genus-@xmath9 heegaard splitting for a manifold is unique up to isotopy , we call the goeritz group of the splitting the _ genus-@xmath9 goeritz group _ of the manifold without mentioning a specific splitting of the manifold . the presentations of those groups have been obtained for some manifolds .",
    "for example , from the works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , a finite presentation of the genus-@xmath7 goeritz group of the @xmath0-sphere was obtained and from @xcite , that of @xmath5 was obtained .",

    "such a lens space @xmath1 with @xmath2 is exactly the one satisfying @xmath3 , which includes the case of @xmath8 .",
    "the basic idea is to investigate the action of the georitz group on the connected primitive disk complex of each of the lens spaces , and then calculate the isotropy subgroups of its simplices up to the action of the goeritz group .",
