    "<S> it is a well known result of classical statistics that a maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) for @xmath1 saturates the cramr - rao bound as @xmath54 , but we can only construct an approximate mle since we have used a measurement that is optimal at @xmath53 as opposed to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> fortuitously , it is nonetheless found to share the same asymptotic properties as the true mle , provided that @xmath51 is sufficiently large , meaning that globally optimal measurements confer no estimation advantage in the limit of large @xmath50  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we can reach a useful conclusion regarding the possibility of global optimality : when @xmath55 is full - rank ( and thus strictly positive ) for all @xmath1 , we show in  @xcite that no globally optimal measurement exists . </S>",

    "<S> even for a handful of qubits we have @xmath104 and @xmath105 for highly mixed states with a very small value of @xmath103 , the adaptive readout performs extremely poorly compared to the coherent readout . </S>",
    "<S> this has huge implications for magnetic field sensing in the nuclear magnetic resonance setup  @xcite , where @xmath106 and implies more than three - hundred times better precision in @xmath1 due to coherent operations .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the gap in the fisher information is reminiscent of the gap in the holevo quantity between coherent decoding versus adaptive decoding , which is shown to be quantum discord in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are several characteristic traits of quantum mechanics that distinguish it from the classical theory : besides non - classical correlations like entanglement and discord , the possibility of performing coherent interactions between different partitions of the probe does not have a classical analogue  @xcite .    in this letter we showed that , in general , coherent readout leads to better precision over adaptive readout in quantum parameter estimation . </S>",
    "<S> we also showed that the two readouts are equivalent for classical probe states . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the noise in some quantum correlated probes can be quadratically suppressed with the use of quantum coherent operations , leading to better precision for parameter estimation . in this manner </S>",
    "<S> we have highlighted the importance of coherent measurements in quantum metrology in the presence of quantum correlations .    </S>",
