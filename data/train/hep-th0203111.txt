    "one might view the central philosophy of string theory as trying to avoid basing our interpretation of spacetime on the notion of a _",
    "point_. having said that , all our concepts of geometry do appear ultimately to remain firmly wedded to points .",
    "it hard not to begin any discussion of spacetime without a topological space , i.e. , a set of points .",
    "compactification produces an excellent laboratory for studying the stringy geometry of space and , in particular , allows us to evade all the thorny issues associated with time .",
    "for example , one takes a type ii string and compactifies on some  threefold @xmath1 to produce an effective theory with four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "the geometry of the  dictates the properties of the conformal field theory associated to the non - linear sigma model of the compactification , which in turn effects the physics in four dimensions .",
    "thus the geometry of @xmath1 can be analyzed in an inherently stringy way from the uncompactified dimensions . by including boundaries on the worldsheet we may analyze d - branes ( at least near the zero - coupling limit of string theory ) .",
    "we can then look at `` 0-branes '' , i.e. , d - branes which span zero dimensions of @xmath1 .",
    "it is these 0-branes which form the bridge between the intrinsically stringy notion of the worldsheet and the more classical notion of a point . in this note",
    "we discuss a couple of properties of 0-branes to highlight how they are key in describing the topology of the target space .",
    "this idea is far from new . using 0-branes to probe",
    "the target space has been used frequently in the past . to name just a couple of examples ,",
    "the syz conjecture @xcite relies on this concept , and in @xcite it was used to analyze orbifolds .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further discussion and references . reconstructing the target space using d - branes",
    "was also recently discussed in a different context in @xcite . in this note",
    "we will discuss 0-branes in the context of the derived category point of view @xcite .",
    "we do this because we believe it is the most intrinsically `` stringy '' way of thinking about a d - brane .",
    "the derived category point of view springs directly from topological field theory .",
    "it is therefore superior to , say , using an effective d - brane world - volume action which presupposes a geometrical interpretation of the d - brane as a subspace .",
    "as the derived category picture highlights , this latter notion is awkward in many situations .    the basic question which emphasizes the rle of 0-branes is the following .",
    "if i gave you all the intrinsic worldsheet information about a field theory based on a sigma model ( with boundaries ) , could you construct the topology of the target space ? using the ideas of bondal and orlov",
    "@xcite we will discuss to what extent this is true .",
    "of course , the question should really be asked with `` the target space '' replaced by `` a target space '' as it is known that frequently two different target spaces can produce the same worldsheet theory .",
    "the central idea is to find which d - brane - like objects can be used as 0-branes .",
    "unfortunately we will not find an answer to this important question but we can give some partial criteria .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that a flop between two topologically inequivalent target spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 is barely noticeable from the worldsheet point of view . as one passes through the flop ,",
    "the worldsheet theory is generically smooth even though the target space acquires singularities . in this sense",
    "it seems much more natural to talk about birational classes of target spaces rather than topological classes .",
    "this is all in line with the general principle that a conformal field theory is an algebraic construction and so algebraic geometry should be the natural setting for stringy geometry .    in this note we will show how the behaviour of 0-branes _ does _ jump discontinuously as one passes through the flop .",
    "this is based on the ideas of bridgeland @xcite and the notion of @xmath0-stability @xcite .",
    "this issue was also noted in @xcite .",
    "in addition the flop has been analyzed from the point of view of the d - brane world - volume in @xcite .",
    "this example vividly illustrates how 0-branes _ put the topology back into stringy geometry_.    for a particular choice of @xmath3 field the conformal field theory becomes singular as one passes through the flop .",
    "it turns out that the derived category description of the flop depends on which side of this special point one passes .",
    "to fully understand this we will discuss monodromy around this point .",
    "this will also produce many more candidate 0-branes further complicating the picture .",
    "the data we choose to analyze is that of the topological b - model with boundaries .",
    "that is , we pretend that we have somehow extracted from the worldsheet data a knowledge of all possible boundaries ( consistent with the topological field theory ) and the corresponding topological field theory of open strings stretched between these boundaries .",
    "this data amounts to a knowledge of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath1 @xcite",
    ". category as discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "although using the derived category might at first be seen as an unnecessary foray into obscure mathematics , it is in fact a very natural construction from the point of view of topological field theory .",
    "no matter how much one might try to avoid the derived category , anyone wishing to describe the topological sector of d - branes and type ii strings would be forced to reinvent the subject or something very similar .",
    "the basic data we have at our disposal consists of the following :    1 .",
    "_ objects : _ classification of all possible topological b - type d - branes associated with worldsheet boundaries . 2 .",
    "_ morphisms : _ the finite - dimensional `` hilbert space '' of open strings ( with ghost number zero ) with given d - branes at each end .",
    "we will use the letters @xmath4 to refer to objects and @xmath5 etc .  to refer to the spaces of morphisms .",
    "the joining of open strings along a common boundary gives the multiplication law in the operator algebra for open strings . in category language",
    "this corresponds to composition of morphisms : @xmath6    as explained in @xcite , the ghost number of the topological field theory can be extended to the d - branes .",
    "we may take an object @xmath7 and produce a new object @xmath8 $ ] by shifting the ghost numbers associated to @xmath7 by @xmath9 . in terms of complexes , @xmath8 $ ] is the complex @xmath7 shifted , or `` translated '' , left @xmath9 places .",
    "the open strings of ghost number @xmath9 with boundaries @xmath7 and @xmath10 are then given by @xmath11)=\\hom(\\mathsf{a}[-n],\\mathsf{b})$ ] .",
    "for the raw category , this is the only information we have .",
    "a d - brane is just an object in the category .",
    "the only information we have about it is the vector space of morphisms from it to any other d - brane .",
    "how then might we decide which d - branes correspond to 0-branes ?",
    "this question was answered by bondal and orlov @xcite in some cases where @xmath1 is not a .",
    "suppose the canonical divisor @xmath12 of @xmath1 is such that @xmath13 for every algebraic curve @xmath14 , or alternatively suppose @xmath15 for every algebraic curve @xmath14 .",
    "let us call an @xmath1 satisfying either of these constraints an `` anti- '' .",
    "the open strings in witten s b - model @xcite on which the derived category construction is based are oriented . in particular @xmath5",
    "need not equal @xmath16 .",
    "having said that , one might try to look for a symmetry which reverses the orientation of the strings .",
    "this would be given by a functor @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for all pairs @xmath19 .",
    "we also demand that these isomorphisms preserve the structure of the category ( we refer to @xcite for details ) .",
    "such a functor was called a `` serre functor '' by bondal and orlov and shown to be unique if it exists .",
    "given an algebraic variety @xmath1 as a target space , the derived category @xmath20 will have a serre functor given by serre duality : @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the dimension of @xmath1 .",
    "following bondal and orlov we define an object @xmath23 in @xmath20 to be a `` bo - point '' object of codimension @xmath24 if there is a serre functor @xmath17 and @xmath25\\\\ \\mathrm{ii)}&\\quad\\hom^{<0}(\\mathsf{p},\\mathsf{p})=0\\\\ \\mathrm{iii)}&\\quad\\hom^0(\\mathsf{p},\\mathsf{p})=\\c . \\end{split } \\label{eq : bopoint}\\ ] ] the idea is that if we know @xmath1 , then sky - scraper sheaves @xmath26 are indeed bo - points in @xmath20 . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath1 is an anti-  then all bo - point objects must be of the form @xmath27 $ ] for some @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the codimension @xmath24 is equal to the dimension of @xmath1 .",
    "thus one can identify the points of @xmath1 purely from their categorical description .",
    "this identification will fail for the case of s but for the meantime let us assume that we have determined these `` point objects '' for @xmath1 .    not only can we determine the set of points on @xmath1 but we may also determine @xmath1 as a topological space . to do this",
    "it is necessary to describe the set of open sets on @xmath1 .",
    "the first step in this process is to identify elements of @xmath20 which correspond to ( a complex with a single nonzero term given by ) a line bundle .",
    "if we have already identified the points as above then this is easy .",
    "an object @xmath30 is a `` line - bundle object '' if there is an @xmath31 ( which may depend on @xmath23 ) such that @xmath32 for all point objects @xmath23 .",
    "again bondal and orlov showed that if @xmath1 exists then such line bundle objects correspond exactly to line bundles possibly translated in the complex by an arbitrary integer .",
    "it is useful to fix the arbitrary translation symmetry in @xmath20 .",
    "choose a point object @xmath33 .",
    "next choose any line bundle object @xmath34 which satisfies ( [ eq : lbobj ] ) for @xmath35 with respect to @xmath33 . a point object @xmath23",
    "will then be called an `` absolute '' point object if @xmath36 .",
    "this effectively restricts attention to point objects corresponding to sky - scraper sheaves at a fixed position in the complex .",
    "the set of absolute point objects is now in one - to - one correspondence with points on @xmath1 .",
    "one may similarly define `` absolute '' line bundle objects as line bundle objects @xmath30 satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "consider now a morphism @xmath38 for an arbitrary pair @xmath39 of absolute line bundle objects .",
    "this induces a map @xmath40 for any object @xmath23 in the obvious way .",
    "let @xmath41 be the set of absolute point objects in @xmath20 such that @xmath42 .",
    "the geometrical meaning of @xmath41 is as follows .",
    "@xmath43 is a global map from @xmath44 to @xmath45 and is thus equivalent to a section of @xmath46 .",
    "a divisor @xmath47 can be associated to the zeroes of this section in the usual way .",
    "if @xmath43 is chosen suitably , this divisor corresponds to a codimension one subspace of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath41 is then the open set in @xmath1 given be the complement of @xmath47 .",
    "these open sets @xmath41 can be used to generate a topology ( namely the zariski topology ) for @xmath1 .",
    "if we could do the same when @xmath1 is a  then we would be done .",
    "the serre functor in this case is given by @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath22 is the dimension of @xmath1 .",
    "this may be seen directly at the worldsheet level .",
    "one can change the orientation of the open strings by reversing the sign of the ghost number . then use a spectral flow argument along the lines of @xcite to shift the ghost numbers by @xmath22 .",
    "this gives the desired serre functor as claimed .",
    "the problem for the  case is that condition i ) in ( [ eq : bopoint ] ) is trivial thus weakening the criteria .",
    "there are many objects in @xmath20 which satisfy the bo - point condition without being sky - scraper sheaves .",
    "we therefore need a more stringent condition for being called a `` point object '' .",
    "if @xmath49 and @xmath50 are points in @xmath1 then one may show that be a smooth embedding with @xmath51 the normal bundle . then",
    "if @xmath52 are sheaves on @xmath53 @xmath54 ] @xmath55 this motivates the following .",
    "an object @xmath7 in @xmath20 satisfying @xmath56 will be called a `` pre - point object '' .",
    "two non - isomorphic pre - point objects @xmath7 and @xmath10 will be called `` mutually consistent '' if they satisfy @xmath57 for any @xmath58 .",
    "unfortunately there are many more pre - point objects in @xmath20 than there are points .",
    "it is not hard to see in any example that many pairs of pre - point objects will not be consistent in the above sense .",
    "let us consider how we can further restrict the conditions on a object being declared a point .",
    "as an example consider the case where @xmath1 is a quintic hypersurface in @xmath59 .",
    "monodromy around loops in the moduli space of complexified khler forms is believed to induce autoequivalences of @xmath20 in accordance with kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry conjecture .",
    "see @xcite , for example , for an account of this .",
    "in particular monodromy around the `` conifold '' point in the case of the quintic is obtained from an autoequivalence given by a particular fourier ",
    "mukai transform @xcite .",
    "under such a transform , the sky - scraper sheaf of a point @xmath26 is transformed into @xmath60 $ ]  the ideal sheaf of functions vanishing at the same point which is then shifted one place left in the complex .",
    "it is therefore impossible to declare that @xmath26 has any more right to be associated to a point than @xmath60 $ ] when only looking at intrinsic categorical data .",
    "lack of mutual consistency can be seen from the fact that @xmath61,\\o_y)=\\c$ ] for any @xmath62 .",
    "one possibility which should immediately spring to mind as regards fixing this problem is that of `` d - brane charge '' .",
    "we may restrict our collection of candidate points by insisting that they all have the same d - brane charge .",
    "for the derived category of coherent sheaves , an object @xmath63 will have a d - brane charge given by the chern character @xmath64 the intrinsic categorical information knows about the chern character because of the hirzebruch - riemann - roch theorem : @xmath65)=       \\int_x\\ch(\\mathsf{a})\\ch(\\mathsf{b})^\\vee\\td(t_x).\\ ] ] this gives a skew - symmetric inner product on the derived category which is believed to be mirror to the intersection form of 3-cycles @xcite .",
    "as such it should be non - degenerate . also , assuming the hodge conjecture to be true , the chern characters of all objects in @xmath20 span @xmath66",
    ". we may therefore claim the following : if @xmath7 and @xmath67 are two objects in @xmath20 and @xmath65 ) =       \\sum_n(-1)^n\\dim\\hom(\\mathsf{a}',\\mathsf{b}[n]),\\ ] ] for all objects @xmath10 in @xmath20 , then @xmath7 and @xmath67 have the same chern character and therefore d - brane charge . thus we know how to analyze d - brane charge from purely categorical data .",
    "the approach one might try to take could then be as follows .",
    "choose a pre - point object in @xmath20 .",
    "now catalogue all other pre - point objects in @xmath20 having the same d - brane charge . in simple cases",
    "it is perhaps conceivable that one might obtain a _ mutually consistent _ set of pre - point objects .",
    "the pre - point objects would hopefully therefore be fully accounted for by all the points on @xmath1 and their translations in @xmath20 by an even number .",
    "unfortunately this procedure is doomed to failure in some ( if not all ) cases as we now demonstrate .",
    "suppose @xmath1 contains a rational curve @xmath68 which may be contracted down to a point by varying the khler form .",
    "we may then `` proceed through '' this wall of the khler cone to produce a flop of @xmath1 into another  space @xmath2 with a new corresponding rational curve @xmath69 . in general @xmath2",
    "can be expected to be topologically distinct from @xmath1 .",
    "the topological @xmath3-model is insensitive to any change in the khler form and so @xmath20 must remain invariant under such a process . indeed , it was shown explicitly in @xcite that @xmath20 is equivalent to @xmath70 .",
    "this presents a challenge to our program . if we are to construct @xmath1 from @xmath20 we should equally be allowed to construct @xmath2",
    ".    bridgeland @xcite gave an explicit form to the equivalence between @xmath20 and @xmath70 .",
    "away from the curves @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 are identical .",
    "that is , we have a one - to - one correspondence between points in these two spaces as shown schematically in figure  [ f : cor ] .",
    "naturally this correspondence breaks down for points within @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "a sky - scraper sheaf on a point in @xmath68 corresponds to an object in @xmath70 which is not simply a sheaf but rather a longer complex .",
    "similarly a point @xmath71 corresponds to a specific non - sheaf object @xmath72 in @xmath20 .",
    "this object @xmath72 is clearly a pre - point object and has the same d - brane charge as a point object in @xmath1 .",
    "it does not however correspond to a point in @xmath1 . we therefore need more information to rule it out as a point in @xmath1 .",
    "since the topological field theory can not distinguish between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we are forced to go beyond the topological field theory , and thus the intrinsic information content of the derived category .",
    "we want to use the @xmath0-stability of @xcite as a criterion for ruling out @xmath72 . in the region of khler form moduli space corresponding roughly to the khler cone of @xmath1 we will show that @xmath72 is unstable .",
    "this was also alluded to in @xcite .",
    "the data required for @xmath0-stability is a `` grading '' @xmath73 associated to a subset of the objects in @xmath20 .",
    "this subset of objects is the @xmath0-stable set of objects .",
    "the grading is determined mod 2 as the phase of the central charge of the corresponding d - brane and , as such , depends continuously on the complexified khler form @xmath74 .",
    "note that the central charge of the d - brane is data visible in the non - compact 4-dimensional @xmath75 supersymmetric field theory and thus fits into our game rules .",
    "it is data we are allowed to use to construct @xmath1 without knowing anything about @xmath1 beforehand .",
    "the exact rules for @xmath0-stability are rather convoluted as explained in @xcite .",
    "as @xmath74 is varied , objects will enter and leave the set of stable objects according to their values of @xmath76 .",
    "the statement of @xmath0-stability is rather simple if we focus attention on a basic set of objects @xmath77 where we know @xmath78 can potentially decay to @xmath79 ( i.e. , the anti - brane of @xmath7 which is actually the same thing as @xmath80 $ ] as argued in @xcite ) and @xmath10 .",
    "assume @xmath79 and @xmath10 are stable and we wish to determine if @xmath78 is stable relative to decay into @xmath79 and @xmath10 .",
    "such a triple of objects forms a `` distinguished triangle '' in @xmath20 and is written : @xmath81|{[1]}&\\\\ \\mathsf{a}\\ar[rr]&&\\mathsf{b}.\\ar[ul ] } \\label{eq : triabc}\\ ] ] the `` [ 1 ] '' denotes that the morphism is really from @xmath78 to @xmath80 $ ] .",
    "@xmath78 is then stable with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath10 if and only if @xmath82 .",
    "it is important to note that the `` [ 1 ] '' in ( [ eq : triabc ] ) can be shuffled around to any edge .",
    "for example , ( [ eq : triabc ] ) can be rewritten @xmath81&\\\\ \\mathsf{a}[1]\\ar[rr]|{[1]}&&\\mathsf{b}.\\ar[ul ] } \\ ] ] this symmetry between the edges means that if the difference in @xmath76 s exceeds one on any of the edges of the triangle , the object in the opposite vertex will decay .",
    "this symmetry is one of the important properties of the derived category which can not be reproduced in any `` abelian '' category such as the category of vector bundles , and shows why categories such as the latter can not fully model d - brane decay @xcite .    in order to analyze the flop we use the following d - branes as building blocks :    1 .   the skyscraper sheaf @xmath26 for @xmath83 .",
    "the skyscraper sheaf @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "the structure sheaf @xmath86 of the flopping curve , i.e. , the 2-brane wrapped around @xmath68 .",
    "the periods of these d - branes are very easy to compute .",
    "we can use mirror symmetry to compute periods exactly ( with respect to @xmath87-corrections ) as in @xcite .",
    "we may localize the picture by assuming that all curves in @xmath1 are very large except for those homologous to @xmath68 . the required picard ",
    "fuch s differential equation was then determined in section 5.4 of @xcite .",
    "the part of the moduli space of @xmath74 which concerns us can be viewed as a 2-sphere as shown in figure [ f : bjs ] .",
    "the large radius limit of @xmath14 is put at one pole and the large radius limit of @xmath88 is put at the other pole . on the equator , which separates the @xmath1 `` phase '' from the @xmath2 `` phase '' we have a point where the worldsheet theory becomes singular .",
    "this latter point will be viewed as the origin in our final coordinate system , so we label it @xmath89 .",
    "there is a natural `` algebraic '' coordinate @xmath90 on this sphere with @xmath91 in the large @xmath68 limit , @xmath92 in the large @xmath69 limit and @xmath93 at @xmath89 . in terms of this coordinate @xmath90",
    "we have a picard  fuchs equation @xmath94 this has a general solution @xmath95 the rules of the `` mirror map '' @xcite ( see @xcite for more details ) then tell us @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the period which is regular and equal to 1 at the large @xmath68 limit ( i.e. , @xmath98 limit ) and @xmath99 is the period whose limiting behaviour is @xmath100 for @xmath98 .",
    "clearly from ( [ eq : pfflop ] ) we have @xmath101 thus @xmath102 at @xmath89 as promised .    in order to compute central charges we use @xcite from section 3 rather than section 2 of @xcite ! ] @xmath103 where the quantum corrections are determined from the fact that @xmath104 is a period .",
    "this immediately yields : @xmath105 i.e. , there are no quantum corrections ! this makes the flop particularly easy to analyze . in most other examples",
    "the complexity of the picard  fuchs system makes the formula for central charged much less amenable as seen in @xcite .",
    "we may capture all the relevant properties of d - brane behaviour near the flop by assuming @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "we thus parametrize the moduli space as in figure  [ f : theta ] .",
    "the grades of our d - branes can be determined from @xmath108 where at large radius limit ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) we insist that @xmath110 @xcite . thus @xmath111    we may now compute d - brane stability . the first distinguished triangle of interest is @xmath112_(0.3){1-\\frac\\theta\\pi}|{[1]}&\\\\ \\o_c\\ar[rr]_{\\frac\\theta\\pi}&&\\o_x\\ar[ul]_0 } \\label{eq : tria}\\ ] ] here we label each edge of the triangle with the difference in grading between the vertices .",
    "it is whether this label is greater than or less than one which determines the stability of the opposite vertex . in derived category language @xmath7",
    "is the `` cone '' of the natural map @xmath113 .",
    "the short exact sequence @xmath114 tells us that @xmath7 is given by @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "the triangle ( [ eq : tria ] ) dictates that @xmath26 will decay into @xmath7 and @xmath86 if @xmath116 .",
    "that is the 0-brane @xmath26 becomes unstable as we pass from the @xmath1 phase into the @xmath2 phase through @xmath117 .",
    "_ this is exactly what we wanted ! _",
    "if we impose the stability constraint on our 0-branes then we lose the `` bogus '' ones living on a curve flopped out of existence .",
    "note that there is _ no _ nontrivial homomorphism @xmath118 with @xmath85 .",
    "this means that there is no distinguished triangle of the form ( [ eq : tria ] ) with @xmath49 replaced by @xmath50 .",
    "this prevents the 0-branes @xmath84 , away from the flop , from decaying  again in line with expectation .",
    "we would now like to find the new 0-branes which jump into existence as we pass into the @xmath2 phase .",
    "it would be nice to have a systematic way of building triangles relevant to our discussion .",
    "clearly homomorphisms from @xmath86 to something else will be of interest since the relative grading is likely to change as we encircle @xmath89 . we might therefore consider a map @xmath119 next . using the spectral sequence ( [ eq : bss ] ) we can show that @xmath120 so we get nothing new here . as a next attempt one can show that @xmath121,\\mathsf{a})=\\c^2 $ ] .",
    "let us see what happens when we consider the cone @xmath10 of a map @xmath122\\to\\mathsf{a}$ ] .",

    "it is not hard to show that @xmath3 is a pre - point object in the sense of ( [ eq : point ] ) and has the same d - brane charge as a point . since @xmath121,\\mathsf{a})=\\c^2 $ ] we had a choice of which map to use to give @xmath10",
    "this essentially gives us a whole @xmath125s - worth of objects @xmath10 .",
    "indeed @xmath10 is exactly the object in @xmath20 studied by bridgeland in @xcite where he showed that the @xmath125 parametrized by the @xmath10 objects fits nicely into @xmath126 to produce precisely @xmath2 .",
    "that is , he showed rigorously that the objects @xmath10 really are the point objects for points on @xmath88 , and so the objects @xmath10 are the @xmath72 objects discussed earlier in this section .",
    "it is very gratifying to note that the objects selected by bridgeland for this purpose are exactly the ones selected by @xmath0-stability for this same rle .",

    "we claim that the @xmath129 objects are the new objects representing points on @xmath68 after monodromy around @xmath89 .",
    "this is exactly the mechanism for monodromy presented in the context of the quintic in @xcite except that here we have had to pass through a number of triangles to perform the monodromy .",
    "note also that even though @xmath129 and @xmath26 are quite different objects in @xmath20 , they have the same d - brane charge .",

    "the derived category picture emphasizes the issues involved in declaring a given d - brane to be a point , i.e. , a 0-brane .",
    "the occurrence of flops and monodromy show that many objects in the derived category have a right to be called a point , but only in a particular region of khler moduli space .    in any sufficiently complex example",
    "it is clear that even if one restricts to a specific d - brane charge , there are an infinite number of candidate point objects for each point in @xmath1 . many of these are related by monodromy transforms like the one we saw above for a flop .",
    "one can also generate similar monodromy transforms for points on the exceptional divisor of an orbifold . insisting that a point object be _ stable _",
    "removes all the monodromy images of each point .",
    "it is overly - optimistic to assume that we have given enough conditions to cut down the number of pre - point objects to be left with the consistent set of true point objects . understanding this",
