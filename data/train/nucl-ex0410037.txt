    "in the last years the nucleus @xmath0cr has been studied quite extensively both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it was formerly shown that shell model ( sm ) calculations are able to reproduce the @xmath0cr ground state ( gs ) band and that its rotational features at low spin can be described by the particle - rotor model ( prm ) as a k=5/2@xmath9 band based on the @xmath10[312]5/2@xmath9 nilsson orbital @xcite .",
    "a rotational behavior was already recognized in the most recent nuclear data sheets ( nds ) compilation @xcite , where , relying on few experimental levels at low excitation energy , sidebands with k@xmath11=1/2@xmath9 , 3/2@xmath9 and 3/2@xmath12 , based on [ 321]1/2@xmath9 , [ 321]3/2@xmath9 and [ 202]3/2@xmath12 nilsson orbitals , have been suggested .",
    "more recently , in the frame of a research using heavy ion induced fusion reactions , evidence of two high - k 3-qp rotational bands with k@xmath13=13/2@xmath14 and k@xmath15 has been found @xcite .",
    "they have been interpreted with the prolate nilsson diagram as due to the excitation of a proton to the empty [ 312]5/2@xmath9 orbital from the [ 321]3/2@xmath9 or the [ 202]3/2@xmath12 one , respectively , followed by the recoupling to the maximum value of @xmath16 of the three unpaired nucleons .",
    "sm calculations for natural ( negative ) parity states were made with the code antoine in the full _ pf _ configuration space @xcite and a very good agreement was obtained .",
    "good agreement was achieved for the observed unnatural ( positive ) parity levels by extending the configuration space to include a hole in the 1d@xmath17 orbital . as b(e2 ) values are an essential mean for evaluating the nuclear deformation , lifetime measurements with the doppler shift attenuation method ( dsam ) were systematically made .",
    "a recent review of the sm predictions and of their interpretation for most @xmath18 1@xmath8 nuclei can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that in heavy ion induced fusion reactions the population of single particle sidebands predicted at low excitation energy is weak . as an example , in the reaction @xmath19ca(@xmath3,n)@xmath20ti , a k=1/2@xmath12 band , classified as [ 200]1/2@xmath12 , was observed about one mev above the [ 202]3/2@xmath12 k=3/2@xmath12 band @xcite . that band",
    "was not observed in a subsequent heavy ion reaction @xcite with a much more efficient set - up .",
    "the knowledge of non yrast structures is , however , required for a better understanding of nuclear structure .",
    "this perspective , often named full spectroscopy , became more important recently , also because some properties of non yrast states are fingerprints of nuclear symmetries and supersymmetries @xcite .",
    "such information was scanty in @xmath21-spectroscopy , as levels up to about 2.5 mev had been studied in the reaction @xmath2ti(@xmath22cr at a bombarding energy of 8 mev , more than twenty five years ago @xcite .",
    "we have used the same reaction but , in order to observe non yrast levels in @xmath0cr , which are populated with small cross - section , a high efficiency @xmath21-detector array was used .",
    "the collected experimental data provide a stringent test for modern sm calculations , as non yrast levels are more subjected to residual interactions and to the effects of configurations space truncation , due to the increased level density . on the other hand",
    ", bands can not be observed in proximity of their smooth terminations , since only states with rather low spin values could be populated .",
    "terminating states are generally well known from heavy - ion induced reactions @xcite .",
    "excited states were populated in the reaction @xmath2ti(@xmath3,n)@xmath0cr with the 12 mev @xmath23-beam provided by the cologne fn - tandem accelerator .",
    "five compton - suppressed ge detectors and one compton suppressed cluster detector were used in the cologne - coincidence - cube - spectrometer @xcite .",
    "four ge detectors were mounted in the horizontal plane at @xmath24 45@xmath25 , @xmath24135@xmath25 .",
    "the fifth ge detector and the cluster detector were placed along the vertical axis below and above the beam line , respectively . the target consisted of 1 mg/@xmath26 @xmath2ti backed onto 5",
    "mg/@xmath27 au .",
    "a total of 200x10@xmath28 @xmath1 coincidences were collected in 3 days of beam time .                about forty percent of them",
    "were due to the reaction on study .",
    "little less came from the @xmath2ti(@xmath3,p)@xmath0v reaction , and nearly twenty percent from the inelastic diffusion . since the target sample contained",
    "about five percent of @xmath29ti , minor contributions came from reactions with this isotope .",
    "an upper limit was put at about 3.6 mev in the @xmath21-ray acquisition .",
    "this resulted in a limitation for the study of high lying levels , since the production of @xmath21 rays with an energy up to 6.6 mev is allowed by the kinematics .",
    "owing to the detector geometry no relevant angular correlation information could be obtained .",
    "the most useful @xmath1 matrices for extending the level scheme have been the two asymmetric ones having all detectors in the first axis and detectors , either at @xmath30 45 degrees ( forward or f matrix ) or at @xmath30 135 degrees ( backward or b matrix ) , in the second axis .",
    "many of the observed transitions were either fully doppler - shifted or not doppler - shifted , in which cases the experimental energy resolution at about 2 mev was about 7 kev and 3 kev , respectively .",
    "the symmetric @xmath1 matrix was used for the analysis of unshifted lines .    a typical analysis of an observed line implied the comparison of spectra obtained with the same gate on backward and forward matrices .",
    "the intrinsic energy and the doppler shift were extracted for all observed transitions by using the most suitable gates for each one .",
    "the transitions were placed in the level scheme after comparing spectra for the same direction , but obtained with different gates , and successive cross checks .",
    "one example for the comparison between forward and backward spectra is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where the gate is the 272 kev @xmath31@xmath32@xmath33 transition .",
    "the presence of unshifted , full shifted and partially shifted lines is evident . from the analysis of full shifted lines , one can estimate the average recoil velocity component along the detector axis as 0.45  % of c , which corresponds to an average recoil velocity of 0.65  % c , in agreement with the kinematics of this reaction .",
    "the adopted level scheme is shown in fig .",
    "all known levels are displayed up to 4 mev .",
    "the few levels , that were not observed in the present experiment , are not connected by transitions . above that energy , only levels",
    "observed in the present experiment are shown .",
    "levels for which no new information was obtained for spin and parity are displayed with thicker lines .",
    "several high spin levels , elsewhere observed , are not reported @xcite .",
    "in particular the gs band had been previously observed up to the band termination at 31/2@xmath9 and the k=13/2@xmath12 up to 19/2@xmath12 .",
    "transitions to the ground state from levels directly fed by the reaction can not be detected in a @xmath1 coincidence experiment .",
    "therefore , some low - spin states could escape an observation if they decay principally to the ground state .",
    "this appears to be the case for the k@xmath11=1/2@xmath9 , i@xmath11= 7/2@xmath9 level , which is missing in fig .",
    "the transitions of the 2613 , 2979 , 3251 and 2504 kev levels to the gs were taken from ref .",
    "several new levels have been observed above 4 mev and up to 5.37 mev , but some others could have escaped the observation , if the depopulating transitions have an energy larger than 3.6 mev .    observed levels and transitions are reported in table i.         + & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & +    *    continued from previous page * + & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & +     +   +   +   +   +    1703&k=1/2@xmath9&1/2@xmath9 & & @xmath34&1703&100&- & & + 1742&2p@xmath17&3/2@xmath9 & @xmath351&1.6(5)&1469@xmath36&29(3)&- & & + & & & & & 1742&71(3)&- & & + 2169&&5/2@xmath9&1.5(5)&@xmath354&427&-&2.1(6 ) & & + & & & & & 1897@xmath36&45(3)&44(5 ) & & + & & & & & 2169&55(3)&54(5 ) & & + 3052&&(9/2)@xmath9&@xmath370.04&&1968&-&56(5)&@xmath356 & + & & & & & 2780&-&44(5 ) & & + & & & & & 3052 & & ? & & + 3500&&(11/2)@xmath9&@xmath370.03&&2416&-&100&@xmath3515 & + 4105&&(13/2)@xmath9&@xmath370.03&&1604&-&56(5)&@xmath3528 & + & & & & & 3021&-&44(5 ) & & + 2504&k=7/2@xmath9&7/2@xmath9&@xmath370.03&@xmath370.012&2232@xmath36&33(5)&- & & + & 1f@xmath38&&&&2504&67(5)&- & & + 3202&&(9/2)@xmath9&@xmath370.04&&2118&-&31(6)&@xmath357 & + & & & & & 2930&-&69(6 ) & & + & & & & & 3202 & & ? & & + 3688&&(11/2)@xmath9&@xmath370.03&&2123&-&31(4)&@xmath359 & + & & & & & 2602&&69(4 ) & & + 4201&&(13/2)@xmath9&@xmath370.03&&1700&-&72(4)&@xmath3530 & + & & & & & 3177&-&28(4 ) & & + 2613&k=3/2@xmath9&3/2@xmath9 & & 0.06(2)&2341&59(3)&- & & + & 1f@xmath38&&&&2613&41(3)&- & & + 3407&&(5/2)@xmath9&&&&-&- & & + 3511&&(7/2)@xmath9&&&3511&52(10)&- & & + & & & & & 2430&48(10)&- & & + 3802&&11/2@xmath9&0.10(3)&&1301&&15(3 ) & & + & & & & & 2718&-&30(4 ) & & + & & & & & 3530&-&55(5 ) & & + 3528&k=13/2@xmath9&13/2@xmath9&0.48(8)&0.38(7)&337.2&4.0(5)&4.3(9 ) & & + & 1@xmath39&&&&1027.6&16(2)&17(3 ) & & + & & & & & 1965.4@xmath36&78(3)&79(4 ) & & + & & & & & 2444.0&1.6(5)&@xmath372 & & + 3900&&15/2@xmath9&0.40(7)&&709@xmath36&-&35(5)@xmath40&12 & + & & & & & 1399@xmath36&-&35(5 ) & & + & & & & & 2337&-&30(5 ) & & + 4571&&17/2@xmath9&0.20(4)&&352&-&@xmath375@xmath40&6 & + & & & & & 1380@xmath36&-&50(7 ) & & + & & & & & 2070@xmath36&-&50(7 ) & & + 1982&k=3/2@xmath12&3/2@xmath12&@xmath352&@xmath352.5&240&-&2.4(6)&&e1 + & @xmath41&&&&279&18(2)&10(2)&&e1 + & & & & & 1710@xmath36&11(2)&6(2)&&m2+e3 + & & & & & 1982&70(2)&81(7)&&e1 + 2432&&5/2@xmath12&1.4(4)&1.3@xmath42&450@xmath36&52(6)&46(6)&25 & + & & & & & 690&-&3.1(6)&0.5&e1 + & & & & & 2160&#&1.2(4)&0.01&e1 + & & & & & 2432&48(6)&50(6)&0.12&e1 + 2912&&7/2@xmath12&0.75(15)&&480&-&33(5)&34 & + & & & & & 930@xmath36&-&13(3 ) & & + & & & & & 2640@xmath36&-&31(5)&0.19&e1 + & & & & & 2912&-&23(4)&0.12&e1 + 3629&&9/2@xmath12&0.18(4)&&717@xmath36&-&29(5)&27 & + & & & & & 1198@xmath36&-&11(2 ) & & + & & & & & 2066&-&4.0(6)&0.167&e1 + & & & & & 2545&-&25(4)&0.53&e1 + & & & & & 3357&-&30(5)&0.28&e1 + 4280&&11/2@xmath12&0.30(6)&&651@xmath36&-&28(4)@xmath40&21 & + & & & & & 1368@xmath36&-&42(5 ) & & + & & & & & 2717&-&17(3)&0.18&e1 + & & & & & 3196&-&13(2)&0.08&e1 + 5049&&(13/2@xmath12)&@xmath370.1&&769&-&@xmath3710@xmath40 & & + & & & & & 1419&-&21(3 ) & & + & & & & & 2548@xmath36&-&38(4)&&(e1 ) + & & & & & 3486@xmath36&-&41(5)&&(e1 ) + 2578&k=1/2@xmath12&1/2@xmath12&@xmath351&&596&-&12(3 ) & & + & @xmath41&&&&836@xmath36&62(5)&57(7)&@xmath376&e1 + & & & & & 875@xmath36&38(5)&30(5)&@xmath373&e1 + 2979&&(3/2@xmath12)&@xmath351&&401@xmath36&-&59(8 ) & & + & & & & & 547@xmath36&-&100 & & + & & & & & 810&-&40(5)&@xmath373.9&e1 + & & & & & 997@xmath36&-&27(4)&@xmath371.4&e1 + & & & & & 1237&-&25(4)&@xmath370.7&e1 + & & & & & 2979&-&?&&e1 + 3251&&5/2@xmath12&0.20(5)&&819@xmath36&-&44(6)&17 & + & & & & & 1269@xmath36&77(5)&44(6)&6 & + & & & & & 2979&#&@xmath375&@xmath370.04&e1 + & & & & & 3251&23(5)&12(3)&0.07&e1 + 3844&&(7/2@xmath12)&0.30(6)&&1412@xmath36&&100 & & + & & & & & 3572&&?&&(e1 ) + & & & & & 3844&&?&&(e1 ) + 4297&&(9/2)@xmath12&0.05(2)&&1385@xmath36&&100 & & + & & & & & 4025 & & ? & & ( e1 ) + 4944&&(11/2)@xmath12&0.07(2)&&1314@xmath36&&100 & & + & & & & & 3860&&?&&e1 + 3893&k=13/2@xmath12&13/2@xmath12&@xmath3510&&364.4&22(2)&17(3)&@xmath372&e1 + & @xmath43&&&&701.9&18(2)&18(3)&@xmath370.3&e1 + & & & & & 2330.0&60(2)&65(4)&@xmath370.03&e1 + 4052&k=(7/2@xmath12)&(9/2@xmath12)&0.26(4)&&1140&&10(2)&2 & + & @xmath43&&&&2489@xmath36&&27(4)&0.5 & ( e1 ) + & & & & & 2968@xmath36&&63(6)&0.7 & ( e1 ) + 4460&&(11/2+)&0.23(4)&&3376&&100&0.8 & ( e1 ) + 4717&&(13/2@xmath12)&0.70(10)&&2216@xmath36&&56(8)&0.5 & ( e1 ) + & & & & & 3154@xmath36&&44(8)&0.1 & e1 + & others & & & & & & & & + 4749&&&@xmath370.05&&2248&&41(8 ) & & + & & & & & 3187@xmath36&&59(8 ) & & + 4810&&&@xmath370.05&&1619@xmath36&&44(8 ) & & + & & & & & 2309&&56(8 ) & & +    data related to the gs k=5/2@xmath9 and the k=13/2@xmath12 bands are not reported since they were already discussed in detail in ref .",

    "these formulae provide mostly a qualitative interpretation tool , since the assumption of a pure value of k is not valid in general .",
    "in fact , even under the extreme hypothesis that the unpaired neutron does not interact singularly with the other nucleons , one has to account for the coupling of the spin of the neutron with the rotational moment in order to conserve the total angular moment i. this is made by the particle - axial rotor model , in brief particle - rotor model ( prm ) , in which context k is not anymore a good quantum number because of the coriolis force .",
    "since the standard prm does not account for residual interaction of the valence nucleon with the other nucleons , it is less reliable than sm , but it may provide a structural interpretation of the sm calculations .    it should moreover be remarked that , approaching 4 mev of excitation , the increase of the level density and the decrease of the deformation , may give rise to large configuration mixing .    fig . 5 shows the level scheme predicted by the prm at low excitation .",

    "concerning positive parity levels , `` extruder '' bands k=3/2@xmath12 and 1/2@xmath12 are expected at low excitation energy , being based on the [ 202]3/2@xmath12 and [ 200]1/2@xmath12 orbitals , respectively .",
    "such bands have been observed at low energy in the nucleus @xmath20ti , where they have been satisfactorily described by prm @xcite .",
    "the 3/2@xmath12 level at 1982 kev is strongly excited by @xmath133=2 pick - up in @xmath134cr .",
    "this agrees with the prm prediction that the [ 202]3/2@xmath12 orbital has a nearly pure spherical 1d@xmath17 hole - configuration .",
    "similarly , the yrast 1/2@xmath12 level at 2578 kev is clearly the band - head of the k=1/2@xmath12 band based on the [ 200]1/2@xmath12 hole configuration as it is strongly excited by @xmath133=0 pickup reaction on @xmath134cr @xcite but , in this case , the orbitals [ 200]1/2@xmath12 and [ 211]1/2@xmath12 share the @xmath133=0 component to a comparable amount .    the first positive parity shell model orbital above the fermi level is the 1g@xmath135 one . in the deformed nucleus @xmath0cr the lowest intruder level of positive parity",
    "is expected to be the 9/2@xmath12 one belonging to the decoupled band based on the @xmath10[440]1/2@xmath12 orbital .",
    "since this level can be qualitatively described with the configuration @xmath29cr@xmath136 it should be strongly excited in a neutron stripping reaction , but this is not feasible since @xmath29cr is unstable . in @xmath137cr a level is observed at an excitation energy of 4.16 mev in the @xmath134cr(d , p ) reaction with a large @xmath138 spectroscopic factor of @xmath139 and it is thus described with a dominant @xmath134cr@xmath136 configuration .",
    "the expected band is , however , not yet observed with @xmath21-spectroscopy .",
    "since the deformation of @xmath134cr is comparable with that of @xmath29cr @xcite , the decoupled band in @xmath0cr should start above 5 mev , because the sloping up @xmath10[312]5/2@xmath9 orbital is empty in @xmath29cr .",
    "we estimate thus that it is out of the sensitivity range of the present experiment .",
    "it is worth noting that the hole excitations , giving rise to the bands k=3/2@xmath12 and 1/2@xmath12 , are not of pure neutron as assumed in prm , since isospin conservation implies a proton - hole contribution of one third for the yrast states 3/2@xmath12 and 1/2@xmath12 .",
    "since the lowest t=3/2 , i=7/2@xmath9 state , isobaric analogue state ( ias ) of the @xmath0v gs , lies at 4764 kev , in the following the comparison of @xmath0cr levels with sm theoretical levels will be limited to states of the lowest isospin t=1/2 .",

    "the sum of the @xmath133=2 pick - up strengths of the 3/2@xmath12 ias s in @xmath20ti and @xmath0cr was probably somewhat overestimated because some contribution of the [ 202]5/2@xmath12 orbital , expected at similar energies , was likely included . concerning the 1/2@xmath12 levels ,",
    "a large experimental @xmath133=0 pick - up strength is concentrated on a level at 6470 kev , which was interpreted as the t=3/2 ias of the yrast 1/2@xmath12 in @xmath0v . the @xmath0cr 1/2@xmath12 level with configuration [ 211]1/2@xmath12 is predicted more than 3 mev above the one based on the [ 200]1/2@xmath12 orbital , but it is likely fragmented owing to the high level density , while ias s are more robust against mixing . it may be that some @xmath133=0 strength due to [ 211]1/2@xmath12 orbital was attributed to ias fragmentation of the t=3/2 , i=1/2@xmath12 state , leading also in this case to an overestimate of the sum of spectroscopic factors with isotopic spin t@xmath140 @xcite .",

    "the present conclusions confirm that of a recent paper @xcite , where the value @xmath144=0.9 @xmath145 was derived from a comparison with sm of 113 experimental magnetic moments in the mass range a=47 - 72 . in the _ sd _ major shell",

    "it is not yet understood , however , why the sum rule in m1 excitation processes requires , as mentioned , the use of strongly quenched @xmath146 values .",
    "one reason why quenching of nucleon g - factor operators due to mec was often assumed is related to the quenching of the @xmath147 coefficient in gamow teller ( gt ) weak decay , which was recently deduced to be also of about 0.75 @xcite .",
    "the weak and the em decays occur , in fact , via similar operators , since the gt operator is @xmath148 , while the magnetic moment operator is @xmath149 , where the upper scripts @xmath150 and @xmath151 refer to the isoscalar and isovector terms , respectively . the smallness of the global mec effects on @xmath152-factor values was ascribed in ref .",

    "a clear correspondence is established between particle - rotor and shell model calculations . moreover three 3-qp bands are observed : the k=(7/2@xmath12 ) is new , the k=13/2@xmath12 is confirmed and the k=13/2@xmath9 is substantially extended .",
    "sm calculations in the full @xmath4 configuration space account for all observed negative - parity levels up to about 4 mev .",
    "calculations account reasonably well for all observed positive parity levels , extending the configuration space to include a nucleon - hole either in the 1d@xmath17 or in the 2s@xmath154 orbitals .    a comprehensive description of @xmath0cr is presented . since , however , some assignments are tentative , a measurement with a larger @xmath21-detector array would be desirable in order to verify the proposed scenario .",
    "a measurement in coincidence with neutrons would , moreover , allow to determine precisely also the branches to the ground state , probably revealing the missing 7/2@xmath9 level of the k=1/2@xmath9 band . particularly challenging",
    "is to improve the knowledge of the 3-qp k=(7/2@xmath12 ) band .",
