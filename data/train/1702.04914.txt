    "we consider a spherical in shape colloidal particle with mesoscopic radius @xmath4 , or two such particles with , in general , different mesoscopic radii @xmath5 and @xmath6 immersed in a medium that is either simple fluid or a binary liquid mixture .",
    "we envisage the case in which the particle is placed at a distance @xmath0 of closest surface - to - surface approach from a planar boundary wall , or the situation in which the surfaces of the two spheres are at such a distance @xmath0 from each other .",
    "we are interested in the force @xmath7 between the particle and the plane or into that one between the two particles .",
    "such fluid mediated forces between two surfaces or large particles are usually referred to as solvation forces @xcite in colloid science .",
    "here we are going to consider the special case when the temperature of the medium is close to the critical temperature @xmath8 of either the liquid - vapor critical point of the simple fluid or the critical demixing point of a binary liquid mixture . in this case",
    "the solvation force acquires , as pointed out by fisher and de gennes @xcite , a contribution due to the critical fluctuation of the medium .",
    "this contribution is of a long - ranged character .",
    "it is characterized , to a great extend , by the gross features of the medium @xcite depending also on the boundary conditions which the bodies immersed in the medium impose on it at their surfaces .",
    "this fluctuation induced force , which is due to the critical fluctuations of the order parameter of the medium is , thus , _",
    "universal _ in nature .",
    "it has a lot of similarities with the force between neutral bodies due to the quantum and temperature fluctuations of the charge distributions in them , i.e. , of the electromagnetic field , which force is known today under the general name of a casimir force ( cf ) @xcite , or , more specifically , quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) cf .",
    "that is why the fluctuation part of the solvation force @xmath9 near @xmath8 is termed _",
    "critical casimir force _ ( ccf ) @xcite .",
    "the force @xmath7 separates into a regular background contribution @xmath10 , which depends on the parameters characterizing the medium in an analytic way , and a singular contribution @xmath11 , which is due to the critical fluctuations of the medium @xmath12 obviously , the grand canonical potential of the system @xmath13 , or the free energy , of the system depends on the geometrical characteristics like @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the temperature and the chemical potential of the fluid .",
    "then one has @xmath14 one normally defines @xmath15 within the system considered we suppose that the colloid particles involved , the solid wall and the medium are all governed by dispersion , van der waals type , interactions .",
    "thus , one shall have @xmath16    it shall be stressed that both the ccf and van der waals force ( vdwf ) are fluctuation induced ones but due to the fluctuations of different entities ",
    "the first is due to massless excitations of the order parameter , while the second is due to that ones of the electromagnetic field . in the current article",
    "we are going to consider how the interplay of these two type of interaction governs the behavior of colloidal particles .",
    "currently there is no general theory available to scope with the problem of quantitative description of the mutual influence of the fluctuation of the electromagnetic field and the order parameter fluctuations of a medium when it is close to its critical point .",
    "the lifshitz theory @xcite  which is the basic one for studying the casimir effect due to the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field has never been meant to nor can deal with the problem of a critical medium between two other media . for practical applications of this theory the main quantity ,",
    "which knowledge for any material involved is required , is the dielectric permittivity @xmath17 . under the normal approach",
    "it is usually tabulated at room temperature for specific values of the angular frequency @xmath18 of the electromagnetic field .",
    "then , in order to perform the specific calculations needed one supposes the analytic validity of a given dependence on @xmath18 , say , the validity of the drude or plasma models for the considered material . it shall be emphasized , however , that in a critical fluid @xmath17 is itself a _ singular _ function of the temperature @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of a theory that quantitatively predicts how @xmath17 depends on the temperature and @xmath18 near the critical point of the medium for a specific material characterized by some characteristic spectrum . due to the hypothesis of universality and scaling when studying critical phenomena one normally is interested only in the gross features of the system and utilizes some effective hamiltonian where only few basic features of the critical medium are reflected . in @xcite",
    "an approach has been suggested for such a system in the case of a film geometry , based on the equation of state of the critical medium , which provides a uniform treatment of the contributions due both to the vdwf and the ccf .",
    "it uses general renormalization group arguments and makes use of field - theoretical methods within mean - field approximation .",
    "this relatively simple model allows all the calculations for the forces involved to be performed on equal footing .",
    "let us note that the expression derived there for the hamaker term is in full agreement with the dzyaloshinskii - lifshitz - pitaevskii theory @xcite .",
    "let us also remind that the mean - field theory is considered as a reliable theoretical horse for the qualitative description of the critical phenomena .    in the current article",
    "we extend the result of @xcite towards systems with more complex geometry  sphere - plane and sphere - sphere .",
    "the interest in the fluctuation - induced phenomena in the last years blossomed due to their importance in the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology where , below a micrometer distances , the vdwf and qed cf play a dominant role between neutral nonmagnetic objects .",
    "the last implies that these forces play a key role in micro- and nano - electromechanical systems ( mems / nems ) @xcite operating at such distances . in vacuum , or gas medium , they lead to irreversible , usually undesirable phenomena , such as stiction ( i.e. , irreversible adhesion ) or pull - in due to mechanical instabilities @xcite . closely related to that is another troubling effect : when a particle s characteristic size is scaled down below a micrometre the role of its weight becomes negligible . as a result ,",
    "when one tries to release such a neutral particle from whatever handling device surface operating on it in air or under vacuum , the particle will not drop down under the gravity but , instead , will stick to its working surface due to the effect of the omnipresent vdwf .",
    "if , in an attempt to release the particle , one charges the particle , forces vibration of the working surface , etc .",
    ", the released particle might move in an uncontrollable way leaving the observation field of the apparatus controlling the performance of the operation .",
    "that is the main reason why the handling , feeding , trapping and fixing of microparts is still the main bottleneck in micro manufacturing and is far from being solved in a satisfactory fashion @xcite .",
    "thus , formalizing the above , one of the main problems in the micro- and nano - assembly is the precise and reliable manipulation of a micro- or nanopart that includes moving it from a given starting point , where it is to be taken from , to some end point , when it is to be placed on . in that respect",
    "it seems ideal , if one can modify the total interaction between the manipulated particle and the operating device , sometimes called gripper , in such a way that it is repulsive for short distances between the working surfaces and the particle and attractive at larger ones .",
    "it is clear that the ability to modify the casimir interaction can strongly influence the development of mems / nems .",
    "several theorems , however , seriously limit the possible search of repulsive qed cf @xcite .",
    "currently , apart from some suggestions for achieving qed casimir repulsion in systems out of equilibrium the only experimentally well verified way to obtain such repulsive force is to have interaction between two different materials characterized by dielectric permittivities @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that @xcite @xmath21 along the imaginary frequency axis , with @xmath22 being the dielectric permittivity of the medium between them . in refs .",
    "@xcite qed casimir repulsion was indeed observed experimentally for the sphere - plate geometry . in order to minimize the potential negative effects of all possible circuitry at such a small distances and the complications with the isolation ,",
    "as well as possible problems involving chemical reactions it seems that one promising strategy for overcoming the obstacles mentioned above is to chose such a fluid as a medium that possesses no free changes dissolved in it and that is inert and do not interact chemically with the materials .",
    "that leads us of choosing as a fluid a nonpolar liquefied noble gas that has critical parameters as close as possible to the normal ones .    in the current article",
    "we will demonstrate that by proper choice of the materials of the colloid particles and the working surface of the gripper it is indeed possible to achieve control over the net interaction between the surface and the particle by simply changing the temperature or the chemical potential in the system .",
    "we also present results for the force between two colloid particles .",
    "let us stress that due to its unique temperature dependence , ccf allows _ in situ _ control of reversible assembly in soft matter and nanoscience .",
    "a further advantage of the force is that both its magnitude and range of action depends on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we demonstrate this for the case of fluid systems consisting of a nonpolar medium , a solvent , @xmath23 comprising two objects of materials @xmath24 and @xmath25 immersed in the solvent , which are coated by thin solid films of substances @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively  see fig . [",
    "fig : fluid_systems ] .        due to",
    "both scientific and technological reasons currently the casimir effect is object of intense studies .",
    "the last is true both for the qed casimir effect , as well as in its thermodynamic manifestation via the ccf . in the current article",
    "we will report theoretical results referring to the critical casimir effect between pair of objects , at least one of which has spherical shape .",
    "let us stress out that the ccf has already been measured @xcite , utilizing light scattering technique , in the interaction between a single colloidal sphere and a flat silica surface immersed in a binary mixture near its critical point .",
    "the theoretical background of the obtained results is discussed in details in ref .",
    "[ ] . in ref .",
    "[ ] , using a system of three optically trapped @xcite spherical colloidal particles , immersed in a critical binary mixture , the authors demonstrated experimentally the theoretically predicted nonadditivity of the fluctuation - induced interactions .",
    "other experimental setups which exploit a sphere - plate or sphere - sphere configurations immersed in a critical fluid include the interaction of spherical colloids with chemically patterned substrates @xcite , formation of critical colloid aggregates @xcite , phase behaviour studies @xcite , various techniques for fine - tuning of the ccf @xcite .",
    "as far as the theoretical side is concerned , it was de gennes who first obtained the ccf between spherical particles @xcite considering a local free - energy functional . among the other techniques used to study the ccf in sphere - plate and sphere - sphere geometries are the ornstein - zernicke theory @xcite , conformal invariance methods @xcite , monte carlo calculations @xcite , fluid - particle dynamics simulations@xcite , mean - field type @xcite and density - functional @xcite theory calculations combined with the derjaguin approximation @xcite . several review articles and works",
    "@xcite summarize both the experimental and theoretical results presented there .",
    "as already stated above , in the current article we study the interplay between the ccf and the dispersion vdwf arising between a sphere and solid plate and between two spheres systems immersed in a solvent which is close to its critical point .",
    "the solvent is thought to be either a nonpolar fluid or binary liquid mixture consisting of nonpolar components that is close to its demixing point .",
    "the interacting objects are assumed coated by thin solid films .",
    "we suppose that the liquid phase of the one - component fluid or one of the components of the binary liquid mixture are strongly adsorbed by _ both _ coating layers , i.e. , they ensure the so - called @xmath3 boundary conditions . the bulk phase ( core ) of the objects , on the other hand , influence the fluid by long - range _ competing _ dispersion potentials . in the case of a simple",
    "fluid these potentials increase the adsorption of the fluid near one of the surfaces , leading to preference there of its liquid phase , and decrease it near the other one . in the case of a binary fluid mixture",
    "the substrates prefer one of the components near , say , the top and the other one near the bottom of the system .",
    "we will demonstrate that this experimentally realizable competition between the effects due to the coatings and the cores can result in interesting effects like sign change of the ccf , as well as the ntf , acting between the surfaces , when one changes @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath0 .",
    "the last facts can potentially be used in controlling the properties of colloidal suspensions and for governing the behavior of objects at small , below micrometer , distances .",

    "[ sec : disandconcrem ] .",
    "important technical details concerning the derivation of the expressions for the interaction forces between spherical particles within the sia are presented in appendix [ sec : appspspsia ] .",
    "since the ccf depends on the critical properties near the bulk critical temperature @xmath8 of the solvent it is governed by universality and scaling @xcite . the last implies that , in first approximation , the critical casimir effect depends only on the gross features of the system  its dimensionality @xmath28 and the symmetry of the ordered state ( both defining the so - called bulk universality class of the system ) and on the boundary conditions ( determined by the surface universality classes ) imposed on the fluid by the bodies immersed in it .",
    "therefore , to a great extend the ccf is _",
    "universal_. the quantitative effects of the presence of a surfaces of the bodies on the thermodynamic behavior of the system depends on the penetration depth of their symmetry breaking effect into the volume . obviously , the range to which these effects are felt within the system depends on two phenomena : on how long - ranged the interactions are and on how long - ranged the fluid correlations , which mediate the interactions between the bodies , are .",
    "the long - ranginess of the correlations is set by the correlation length @xmath29 of the order parameter of the solvent ; @xmath29 becomes large , and theoretically diverges , in the vicinity of the bulk critical point @xmath30 : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the usual critical exponents which , for classical fluids , are those of the three - dimensional ising model , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the corresponding nonuniversal amplitudes of the correlation length along the @xmath39 and @xmath2 axes .",
    "when @xmath29 becomes comparable to the characteristic dimension of the system , say the separation @xmath0 between the objects , the size dependence of the thermodynamic functions enters into the thermodynamic potentials through the ratio @xmath40 , and takes a scaling form given by the finite - size scaling theory @xcite .",
    "then    _ i ) _ for the interaction of a colloidal particle with spherical shape with radius @xmath4 with a half - space bounded by a plane in the case of a system governed only by short - ranged interactions the theory @xcite predicts : @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the temperature and field relevant in renormalization group sense scaling variables and @xmath43 .",
    "note that this prediction shall be valid for any dimensionality @xmath28 since it simply takes into account that the dimension of a hypersphere in a @xmath28 dimensional space is one dimension less than that of the space itself .",
    "when the hyperscaling holds , i.e. , for @xmath44 for short ranged systems , the scaling function @xmath45 is universal .",
    "when @xmath46 a nonuniversal system dependent prefactor is expected to be present which shall be taken into account in the corresponding analysis .",

    "short - ranged , but by long - ranged dispersion interactions .",
    "that will require some modifications of eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "furthermore , we will obtain @xmath49 and @xmath50 utilizing the derjaguin @xcite and the recently introduced surface integration approach @xcite .",
    "for that aim we will need the corresponding results for a system with a film geometry that is governed by the same dispersion interactions as those of sphere - plate and sphere - sphere interactions .",

    "we start with the behavior of the thermodynamic casimir force in nonpolar fluid systems with dispersion forces .",
    "the specifics of the scaling theory for systems with dispersion forces are described in details in refs .",
    "that is why we will just briefly remind here some very basic facts that will also serve us for introducing notations needed further in the main text .",
    "we consider a fluid systems consisting of a nonpolar medium @xmath23 comprising two thick parallel plates of materials @xmath24 and @xmath25 which are coated by thin solid films of substances @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively  see fig .",

    "we suppose that the dispersion forces governing all the parts of the considered system depend on the distance @xmath57 between the constituents of the bodies in the system @xmath58 , where @xmath28 is the dimensionality of the space and @xmath59 is a parameter that controls the decay of the dispersion interactions . the last implies @xmath60 interactions between the fluid particles and substrate potentials @xmath61 acting on the fluid particles at a distance @xmath62 from the surface of the colloid particles . when @xmath63 such long - range interactions are termed subleading long - ranged interactions @xcite .",
    "the systems governed by them do also belong to the ising universality class characterized by short - ranged forces @xcite , i.e. , the critical exponents , e.g. , do not depend on @xmath59 for such type of interactions . for @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath65 one has the usual van der waals interactions , while @xmath64 and @xmath66 corresponds to the retarded casimir - polder one .",
    "these two interactions are two prominent representative of the class of subleading long - ranged interactions . when @xmath64 , the ising universality class is characterized by critical exponents @xcite @xmath67 clearly , by varying the ratio between the strengths of the long - ranged  @xmath68 and the short - ranged ",
    "@xmath69 contributions in the fluid interaction one can quantitatively probe the importance of the long - ranged parts of the interactions within the fluid medium .",
    "one can also in this way study potential experiments in colloidal systems which allow for a dedicated tailoring of the form of the effective interactions between colloidal particles .",
    "the contribution of the dispersion forces to the total effective force eq .   can be distinguished from that of the ccf by their temperature dependence , because the leading such of the former does not exhibit a singularity .",
