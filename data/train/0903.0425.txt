    "the motion of a particle is described by the equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the position of the particle at time @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the velocity of the particle at time @xmath6 .",
    "as initial conditions we take @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a non - random vector . the force field is assumed to be stationary and isotropic .",
    "the precise form of the force field will be discussed below .",
    "we shall be interested in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath5 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "the process @xmath11 can be written in the integral form as @xmath13 formal arguments , based on the near - independence of contributions to the integral on the right - hand side of ( [ vel ] ) from non - intersecting sub - intervals , suggest that @xmath11 behaves as a diffusion process , if time is re - scaled appropriately .",
    "in fact , we shall prove that there is an event @xmath14 in the underlying probability space @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 converges , as @xmath19 , to a diffusion process on @xmath14 ( the probability measure on @xmath14 is defined by conditioning @xmath20 on the event @xmath14 ) .",
    "in particular , the kinetic energy of the particle will be shown to tend to infinity as @xmath12 .",
    "the precise formulation of these results will be provided in section  [ mr ] .",
    "we can not , however , expect that @xmath18 converges to the diffusion process for almost all realizations of the force field , if @xmath10 is fixed . indeed ,",
    "depending on the assumptions imposed on @xmath2 , the trajectory may remain in a bounded region of space and the velocity may remain bounded with positive probability .    it must be noted that we must exclude the case @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a stationary field , since in this case @xmath23 is a hamiltonian flow with the hamiltonian @xmath24 ) .",
    "earlier papers primarily studied the behavior of @xmath5 and @xmath11 on long time intervals , whose length , however , depended on @xmath25 , where the initial velocity @xmath10 was treated as a large parameter .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath10 is fixed and @xmath6 tends to infinity .",
    "the trade - off is that we need to exclude an event of small but positive measure from the underlying probability space .",
    "let us mention some of the earlier results concerning the long - time behavior of @xmath5 and @xmath11 . in @xcite , kesten and",
    "papanicolaou considered the equation @xmath26 with the initial data @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "certain mixing assumptions were imposed on the force field @xmath2 .",
    "it was shown that if @xmath29 , the process @xmath30 converges weakly to a diffusion process @xmath31 with the initial data @xmath32 .",
    "the generator of the limiting process can be written out explicitly .",
    "the process @xmath33 converges weakly to @xmath34 .",
    "note that equations ( [ large ] ) and ( [ small ] ) are related via the change of variables @xmath35 therefore , the convergence result for @xmath30 can be formulated in terms of @xmath11 as follows : the process @xmath36 converges to a diffusion process when @xmath10 tends to infinity in such a way that @xmath37 remains fixed .",
    "similarly , @xmath38 converges weakly to a limiting process .    in @xcite , durr , goldstein , and",
    "lebowitz extended the convergence results to the two - dimensional case .",
    "the field @xmath2 was assumed to be a gradient of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a smooth function with compact support , and the points @xmath41 form a poisson field on the plane .",
    "an additional difficulty in the two - dimensional case is that , unlike the case with @xmath29 , typical trajectories of ( [ large ] ) will self - intersect . in @xcite ,",
    "komorowski and ryzhik proved the two - dimensional result in the case when @xmath22 is sufficiently mixing , but is not necessarily generated by a poisson field .    in @xcite ,",
    "komorowski and ryzhik considered the process ( [ large ] ) on a longer time scale .",
    "namely , they demonstrated that @xmath42 converges to a brownian motion for all sufficiently small @xmath43 .",
    "it was assumed that @xmath44 , where @xmath22 is sufficiently mixing .    unlike the above papers",
    ", we shall consider the asymptotic behavior of @xmath11 when @xmath10 is fixed and @xmath12 .",
    "first , however , assume that @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and let @xmath47 be the limiting process for @xmath48 as @xmath45 .",
    "( it satisfies the stochastic differential equation ( [ diff1 ] ) , below . )",
    "as has been noted by dolgopyat and de la llave in @xcite , the process @xmath47 is self - similar , that is for @xmath49 the process @xmath50 satisfies the same stochastic differential equation with initial condition @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath52 fixed , @xmath53 tends to the diffusion process ( [ diff1 ] ) starting at @xmath54 .",
    "if , instead , we assume that @xmath10 is large but fixed , and take the limit as @xmath55 , we formally obtain that @xmath56 tends to the diffusion process ( [ diff1 ] ) starting at the origin .",
    "we remark that the diffusion processes satisfying the self - similarity property described above are well understood ( see e.g. @xcite , section xi ) .",
    "in particular the fact that this process is non - recurrent for @xmath57 plays a crucial role in our analysis .",
    "let @xmath58 be the space of smooth functions @xmath59 which are supported inside the ball or radius @xmath60 centered at the origin and satisfy @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a probability measure on @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that @xmath62 is symmetric in the sense that if @xmath63 is a mapping that maps a function @xmath64 into @xmath65 , then @xmath66 for any measurable set @xmath67 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath62 is isotropic , that is the vectors @xmath68 and @xmath69 have the same distribution for each orthogonal matrix @xmath70 and points @xmath71 .",
    "suppose that on a probability space @xmath72 we have a sequence of functions @xmath73 which are independent and identically distributed with distribution  @xmath62 .",
    "we shall consider random vector fields @xmath2 of the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 form a poisson point field with unit intensity on @xmath76 .",
    "we assume that the poisson field is independent of the sequence @xmath77 .",
    "note that the force field  @xmath2 defined by ( [ ff ] ) is stationary , isotropic , and has zero mean .",

    "let @xmath80 be a standard @xmath81-dimensional brownian motion . consider the @xmath81-dimensional process @xmath47 which satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the first coordinate vector .",
    "it is clear that the integrals defining @xmath85 and @xmath86 are non - negative .",
    "we shall require that @xmath87 thus , the case when @xmath44 , where @xmath22 is a stationary random field , is excluded from consideration .",
    "the generator of the process @xmath47 is @xmath88 where @xmath89 by examining the stochastic differential equation satisfied by @xmath90 ( see formula ( [ energy ] ) below ) , it is it follows that the origin is an inaccessible point for the process @xmath47 if @xmath29 ( see @xcite , section xi )",

    "let @xmath105    we observe that the fact that our force is poisson and rotation invariant ( rather than a general strongly mixing force ) is primarily used in subsection [ sssi ] .",
    "an alternative approach would be to estimate the rate of convergence in the averaging theorem ( our lemma [ ole ] ) using the techniques of @xcite or @xcite but this would make the proof much more complicated .",
    "therefore in this paper to we consider the simplest possible force distribution leaving the extension to more general force fields as an open question",
