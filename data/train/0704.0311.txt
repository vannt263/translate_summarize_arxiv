    "<S> a recent advance in improving the spatial resolution of magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) uses as sensor tips carbon nanotubes grown at the apex of conventional silicon cantilever pyramids and coated with a thin ferromagnetic layer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic images of high density vertically recorded media using these tips exhibit a doubling of the spatial frequency under some conditions @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this spatial frequency doubling is due to the switching of the moment direction of the nanotube tip . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a signal which is proportional to the absolute value of the signal normally observed in mfm . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in the observed switching , and that it should be possible to image very high bit densities with nanotube magnetic force sensors .    </S>",
    "<S> spatial period doubling has been observed for several carbon nanotube tips with different track widths and bit densities . </S>",
    "<S> the mfm images reported here were made using the nanotube tip shown in the inset of figure [ fig : tipandgeo ] . </S>",

    "<S> the means of producing metal - coated carbon nanotube tips on afm cantilevers and the techniques for imaging magnetic media using these tips have been described previously @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , carbon nanotubes were grown using wafer - scale chemical vapor deposition at the apexes of the pyramids of commercial silicon tips intended for tapping mode atomic force microscopy . for the present measurements </S>",
    "<S> the nanotubes were shortened to a length of about 250 nm using an electrical cutting method @xcite , aligned approximately perpendicular to the cantilever using a focused ion beam @xcite , and then coated to a total thickness of about 16 nm with a ti / co / ti trilayer by e - beam evaporation from a direction parallel to the nanotube long axis ( see the inset in figure [ fig : tipandgeo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic imaging was done using the tapping / lift@xmath0 mode of a digital instruments nanoscope iii spm at room temperature in air . in this mode , </S>",
    "<S> the topography of the sample is first determined for each line with a scan at low tip - sample spacing @xmath1 , then the tip is retracted a specified distance and a second line scan is made while recording the deviation of the phase angle @xmath2 of the cantilever response with the cantilever driven slightly below its resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath3 , the derivative of the force on the cantilever with respect to @xmath1 .    </S>",

    "<S> a collection of phase shift images at 300 kilo - flux changes per inch ( kfci ) and different tip - sample spacings ( @xmath1 s ) are shown in figure [ fig : natnt2](a ) , and at constant lift height ( 15 nm ) and different bit densities in figure [ fig : natnt2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> cross - sections of the data through the center of the tracks are displayed in figure [ fig : natnt2](c , d ) . </S>",
    "<S> modeling of this data as described below is shown in figure [ fig : natnt2](e , f ) . at high values of @xmath1 and high bit densities </S>",
    "<S> the phase images have the same period as written , but at low @xmath1 s and low bit densities anomalies in the images gradually develop into sharp features with double the original periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> these anomalies are due to switching of the orientation of the magnetic moment of the tip . </S>",
    "<S> this can be demonstrated most convincingly by inspecting the images and cross - sections of figure [ fig : natnt2](b , d ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> a background from the sections of the image without written bits has been subtracted out , and it can be seen that at low bit densities the phase shift always stays below the average background level , keeping the tip - sample force attractive by switching of the tip moment direction just as the force derivative crosses zero .

    "<S> the slabs have a uniform magnetization with moment direction alternating between parallel and anti - parallel to the @xmath7-axis direction . </S>",
    "<S> the tip is assumed to have a square cross - section with width @xmath10 and length @xmath11 , with the tip end a distance @xmath1 from the upper surface of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic fields above the sample ( displayed as field lines in figure [ fig : tipandgeo](b ) ) were calculated both analytically and numerically . in our numerical modeling the vector between the individual medium dipole moments [ @xmath12 and a position </S>",
    "<S> [ @xmath13 is @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> then the @xmath7 and @xmath5-component of the field from the individual dipoles is given by @xmath15    with @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 is given by setting @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the second equation . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the tip can also be represented by a sum of point dipoles @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a unit vector in the tip moment direction , the force gradient on the tip is given by @xmath22 , \\label{eq : force_gradient}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the distance between the individual dipole elements in the tip and medium , and @xmath24 is the angle between the tip moment direction and the @xmath7-axis .    for positions near the center of the tracks we obtained analytical expressions for the magnetic fields by assuming that the magnetically oriented slabs have infinite width @xmath8 in the @xmath9 direction . </S>",
    "<S> if we take the boundary condition @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the surface magnetic charge , the magnetic field above the sample can be written as @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 taking the surface magnetic charge @xmath26 to be uniform in @xmath9 , @xmath29 we find @xmath30 \\label{eq : steifel_hz_sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath31 , @xmath32 a scalar potential , the @xmath5-component of the field can be written as @xmath33 , which leads to @xmath34 \\label{eq : steifel_hx_sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath35 is zero by symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : zhifield ] displays the calculated fields in the @xmath7 and @xmath5 directions ( a , c ) , the tip moment orientation angle @xmath24 ( b ) , and the switching fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( c ) for the best fit to the data as described below . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that the discontinuous switches of @xmath24 are controlled predominantly by the size of the @xmath5 component of the field . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by examining the trajectory in field that the tip takes in moving from one domain to the next . </S>",
    "<S> the ovals in figure [ fig : zhifield]c are the calculated trajectories of @xmath38 vs. @xmath39 for the tip heights listed in the caption . </S>",
    "<S> the  asteroid \" is the critical field calculated for the energy functional form of eq . 1 of the main text and has the form first predicted by stoner and wohlfarth@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tip moment direction is predicted to switch when the field trajectories cross the critical field asteroid ( solid dots in figure [ fig : zhifield]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this happens for relatively large values of @xmath40 and small values of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> when the field trajectory crosses the stoner - wohlfarth asteroid at large values of @xmath41 the tip has already switched to the low energy configuration .    for numerical work </S>",
    "<S> the medium was assumed to be composed of a collection of individual dipole moments @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the saturation magnetization and @xmath45 the volume of the individual medium elements . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we take both the tip and medium volume elements to be cubes 4 nm on a side . </S>",
    "<S> this results in agreement to within a few percent between our numerical work and analytical expressions for the medium magnetic fields . halving the size of the volume elements ( to cubes 2 nm on a side ) </S>",
    "<S> changes the calculated force derivative curve for @xmath1 = 30 nm ( see figure [ fig : natnt2]c ) by about 2% .    to model the dynamics of the tip flip process , we conceptually divide the tip into two domains , one with length @xmath46 close to the medium , the other with length @xmath47 further away . </S>",
    "<S> each has sufficiently strong exchange fields that the entire volume within each domain has the same moment orientation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the section of the tip furthest from the medium is assumed to have its moment parallel to the @xmath7 axis ; that closest to the medium has its moment at an angle @xmath24 relative to the @xmath7-axis ( figure [ fig : tipandgeo ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the energy of the tip in an external magnetic field can be written as : @xmath48 \\label{eq : phienergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken the simplest non - trivial forms for the domain wall energy ( first term ) and the anisotropy energy ( second term)@xcite . the third term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : phienergy ] is the energy of the dipole moments of the tip in the external magnetic field . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 is the anisotropy energy density , @xmath50 is the domain wall energy per unit area , @xmath51 is the tip saturation magnetization , and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the magnetic fields in the @xmath7 and @xmath5 directions respectively averaged over the tip volume from @xmath52 to @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> to simulate the magnetic force images , the tip moment is at first assumed to be parallel to the @xmath7-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the tip is moved to a new position , the local fields are calculated and averaged over the tip volume , @xmath24 is moved to the new local minimum in energy ( eq . [ eq : phienergy ] ) , the force gradient is calculated , and the process is repeated . </S>",
    "<S> this modeling results in the cross - sections displayed in figure [ fig : natnt2](c , f ) , which reproduce the absence of tip switching at high bit densities and high lift heights , and the presence of tip switching at low bit densities and low lift heights . </S>",
    "<S> when tip switching occurs , the modeling also reproduces the fact that the tip - sample force gradient always stays negative , with the tip moment reversing as the z - component of the field crosses zero . </S>",
    "<S> the quantitative interpretation of mfm images in the presence of tip switching is straightforward once it is recognized that the phase shift @xmath2 is proportional to the negative of the absolute value of the tip sample force gradient ( -@xmath54 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental phase shift oscillation amplitudes decrease much more rapidly than the modeling for bit densities above about 500 kfci ( figure [ fig : natnt2]f ) . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this is because the as written bits do not have as abrupt moment orientation reversals as our idealized model . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling indicates that nanotube tips with the geometry of figure [ fig : tipandgeo ] could be used to image bits with sharp moment direction transitions with densities above 2000 kfci ( 13 nm / flux reversal ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : zhiexcmd ] compares the maximum minus the minimum value for @xmath2 along a cross - section through the center of the bits at a bit density of 300 kfci as a function of tip height @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the modeling results in this figure are labeled by the length @xmath46 of tip that is allowed to reorient its magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> there are three parameters in this analysis - a global multiplicative factor , @xmath55 , and the reduced domain wall energy @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : zhiexcmd]b plots the best fit values for @xmath55 and @xmath57 ( n the number of data points ) . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> the best fit value for @xmath56 is 0 , and the @xmath58 value at @xmath59 is approximately double that when @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the domain wall energy requires larger switching fields : the best fit value at @xmath46= 64 nm for @xmath55 increases from 20.8 to 28.6 when @xmath56 increases from 0 to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the domain wall energy for co is reported to be @xmath61@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to @xmath62 , using @xmath63 and @xmath64=0.25 @xmath65 ( neglecting crystalline anisotropy ) , with @xmath66 , so that our fits are consistent with the calculated wall energy , if one allows for a doubling of the best @xmath58 value . </S>",
    "<S> the tip end may be magnetically poorly coupled to the rest of the tip because of an inhomogeneity or grain boundary : it appears ( figure [ fig : tipandgeo ] inset ) to have granularity on the scale of a few tens of nm and a kink about 50 nm from its end . </S>",
    "<S> we have observed qualitatively similar spatial frequency doubling using several nanotube tips , particularly in the smallest diameter tips , where inhomogeneities and weak magnetic coupling are fundamentally more difficult to avoid .    </S>",
    "<S> the shift @xmath67 in the resonance frequency @xmath68 of the cantilever due to a force gradient between the tip and sample @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the spring constant of the cantilever . </S>",
    "<S> the phase shift @xmath2 of the cantilever response is then given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the quality factor , @xmath74 is the driving frequency and @xmath75 is the perturbed resonance frequency of the cantilever . at @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts an excursion of @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> using a driving frequency at optimal sensitivity @xmath78 , @xmath79 , q=350 , @xmath80 , and estimating @xmath81 @xcite and @xmath82 @xcite , this corresponds to an excursion in the phase shift @xmath83 , in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of @xmath84 given the uncertainties in the values for the saturation magnetizations . using @xmath85 2 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the best fit value @xmath86 17 ( figure [ fig : zhiexcmd ] ) implies a critical field of approximately 2.4@xmath87 a / m , much smaller than the saturation magnetization of cobalt of 1.4@xmath88 a / m , but comparable to a switching field of 3.2@xmath87 a / m reported for 30 nm thick , 0.34 @xmath89 m wide , 2.04 @xmath89 m long ellipsoidal amorphous cobalt nanodots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction in switching field could result from competition between the crystalline and shape anisotropies @xcite if , for example , the uniaxial crystalline anisotropy favors moment alignment along the tip radial direction , while the shape anisotropy favors the axial direction . </S>",
    "<S> the tip material could also have a complicated structure incorporating grain and domain boundaries , reducing the anisotropy energy . </S>",
    "<S> the highly non - uniform fields in our case could also play a role in reducing the switching field .    </S>",
    "<S> although our analysis has been presented using a specific model for the tip dynamics , the conclusion that the tip moment flips at relatively small fields can be presented simply : the magnetic field at the tip must be less than the magnetic field at the medium surface , which is given by the saturation magnetization of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the fields required to flip the tip are expected , using for example the stoner - wohlfarth model @xcite , to be about the saturation magnetization of the tip , which is for epitaxial cobalt much larger than the saturation magnetization of the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the switching fields of our nanotube , just as for amorphous nanodots , are much smaller than those of epitaxial co nanodots @xcite , which are comparable to the saturation magnetization of cobalt </S>",
    "<S> . it might be possible to avoid switching and the attendant spatial frequency doubling by developing processes to epitaxially coat the nanotube or by using single - crystal nanorods . </S>",
    "<S> however , such tips would also generate larger local magnetic fields at the sample , increasing the possibility of changing the magnetic state of the sample , particularly for the smallest samples . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that reliable information on the moment orientations of the media can be inferred even in the presence of tip switching if it is realised that the mfm signal is proportional to the absolute magnitude of the tip - sample force gradient . </S>"
