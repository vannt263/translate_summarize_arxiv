    "for a finite - size cluster with @xmath7 spins , the fidelity susceptibility @xmath8 exhibits a notable singularity at a critical point .",
    "because the tractable system size with the numerical - exact - diagonalization method is restricted severely , an alternative scheme for criticality might be desirable to complement traditional ones .",

    "such a notorious wavy deviation seems to be suppressed for @xmath9 ; the fidelity susceptibility may serve a promising candidate for the numerical analysis of critical phenomena .    to be specific , the hamiltonian for the two - dimensional transverse - field ising model is given by @xmath15 here , the pauli operator @xmath16 is placed at each two - dimensional- ( square- ) lattice point @xmath17 .",
