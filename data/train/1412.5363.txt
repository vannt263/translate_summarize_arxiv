    "in modeling of physical phenomena , stochastic differential equations are required to quantify the effects of randomness on the mathematical model .",
    "taking the context of electromagnetism as an example , to model precise microscopic origins of randomness ( the thermal motion of electrically charged microparticles ) , @xcite established the theory of fluctuations of an electromagnetic field , which at the level of macroscopic view was via introducing fluctuation sources to obtain stochastic maxwell equations .",
    "based on this model , @xcite proposed a method based on wiener chaos expansion to determine the near field thermal radiation , and @xcite described the fluctuation of the electromagnetic field using spectral representation . without modeling the precise origins of randomness ,",
    "rather assume that they lead to small stochastic variations of the coefficients of the equations , @xcite studied the propagation of ultra - short solitons in a cubic nonlinear media , which is modeled by nonlinear maxwell equations with stochastic variations of media ; and assume that the externally imposed source is a random field , which is expressed by a q - wiener process , @xcite dealt with the mathematical analysis of stochastic problems arising in the theory of electromagnetic in complex media , including well posedness , controllability and homogenisation . the stochastic model considered in this paper is based on ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 12 ) for the isotropic homogeneous medium with an external source .",
    "recently , the stochastic multi - symplectic structure for three dimensional ( 3-d ) stochastic maxwell equations with additive noise was proposed in @xcite , based on the stochastic version of variational principle , which means that stochastic maxwell equations are a system of stochastic hamiltonian partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "it has been widely recognized that the structure - preserving numerical methods have the remarkable superiority to conventional numerical methods when applied to hamiltonian odes and pdes , such as long - term behavior , structure - preserving , physical properties - preserving ( energy , divergence , charge ) etc . ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "efforts have been devoted to the stochastic case .",
    "for example , authors in @xcite established the theory for the stochastic multi - symplectic conservation law for the stochastic hamiltonian pdes and investigated a stochastic multi - symplectic method for stochastic nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "also a stochastic multi - symplectic wavelet collocation method was proposed in @xcite to approximate stochastic maxwell equations with a class of multiplicative noise , while @xcite proposed another stochastic mutli - symplectic method based on the stochastic variational principle .",
    "different from the approach of reference @xcite , we use a direct way to represent the stochastic maxwell equations as another system of stochastic hamiltonian pdes , which avoids introducing extra variables and leads to cost efficiency . as a result ,",
    "the stochastic maxwell equations preserve the stochastic multi - sympectic conservation law almost surely .",
    "meanwhile , we show that the averaged energy increases linearly as the growth of time , with the rate being @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 represents the levels of noise , and @xmath3 denotes the trace of operator @xmath4 .",
    "it means that the growth rate depends on the scale of noises and the trace of covariance operator only .",
    "this dissipative property of averaged energy may be due to the existence of external source .",
    "for the divergence , it is proved that the flow of stochastic maxwell equations preserves the divergence in the sense of expectation .",
    "it means that electric flux and magnetic flux are preserved in gaussian random fields in the statistical sense . in this paper , we propose three numerical methods to discretize stochastic maxwell equations with additive noise in order to investigate the preservation of these physical properties numerically .",
    "method - i is based on the application of implicit midpoint method in both temporal and spatial directions to the equivalent stochastic hamiltonian pdes , while method - ii being a three - layer method is constructed by central difference in both temporal and spatial directions , which exhibits the grid staggering property of electromagnetism .",
    "we utilize central difference in spatial direction and implicit midpoint method in temporal direction to obtain method - iii .",
    "we demonstrate that all of the three numerical methods preserve the corresponding discrete versions of multi - symplectic conservation law .",
    "another aim of this paper is to investigate the numerical preservation of some important physical quantities including energy and divergence by numerical methods . for the energy ,",
    "we obtain the corresponding dissipative property of the discrete averaged energy satisfied by each method .",
    "furthermore , utilizing the adaptedness of solutions to stochastic maxwell equations and properties of wiener process , we estimate the dissipative rates with respect to time for three methods in our consideration , and we show that the discrete averaged energies evolute at most linearly with respect to time under certain assumptions . as for divergence , we show that all of the three methods preserve the discrete conservation law of averaged divergence well , as shown theoretically in theorem  [ divergence1 ] , [ divergence2 ] and [ divergence3 ] . finally , numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical results .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we present some preliminaries about stochastic maxwell equations , including theorems about the evolution of energy and divergence , and the intrinsic stochastic multi - symplectic structure .",
    "sections 3 is devoted to the comparison and analysis of three stochastic multi - symplectic numerical methods in the aspect of averaged energy and averaged divergence .",
