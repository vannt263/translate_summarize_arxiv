    "fate of vacuum in a strong coulomb potential produced by a heavy atomic nucleus is a fundamental problem of quantum electrodynamics and has been the subject of a long study  @xcite .",
    "one of the physical quantities that have attracted particular interest is the induced vacuum polarization  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that there are two distinct regimes , subcritical @xmath0 and supercritical @xmath1 , depending on the nuclear charge @xmath2 relative to the reciprocal of the fine structure constant @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "although the resulting physics can be qualitatively different in the two regimes  @xcite , intriguing phenomena caused by the supercritical coulomb potential remain elusive because of the absence of such superheavy atomic nuclei .",
    "the situation has changed since 2004 when a graphene was successfully isolated  @xcite , which realizes massless dirac fermions in two dimensions with the fermi velocity @xmath4 m/s  @xcite .",
    "because the corresponding `` fine structure constant '' is as large as @xmath5 , a cluster of charged impurities placed on graphene can produce the supercritical coulomb potential and thus the resulting intriguing phenomena are now within experimental reach  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the vacuum polarization of graphene has been studied intensively in both subcritical and supercritical regimes  @xcite . however ,",
    "in our opinion , the vacuum polarization induced by the supercritical coulomb potential has not been understood completely even without electron - electron interaction .",
    "the objective of this paper is to shed new light on this longstanding fundamental problem .",
    "noninteracting massless dirac fermions in two dimensions subject to a coulomb potential are described by the dirac equation : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the kinetic term , @xmath8 is the normalized energy , and @xmath9 is the dimensionless coupling constant with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the electron and impurity charges , respectively . because the coulomb potential is circularly symmetric ,",
    "the wave function @xmath12 can be chosen as an eigenfunction of the conserved total angular momentum ; @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the vacuum polarization electron density is formally expressed as @xmath14 assuming appropriate normalization and regularization  @xcite .",
    "while an explicit calculation will be performed below , the functional form of @xmath15 can be deduced only from symmetry and dimensional analysis . in particular , because of the absence of intrinsic scale in the subcritical regime @xmath16 , the induced electron density has to be in a scale invariant form and the only possibility is @xmath17 we note that another apparently possible form @xmath18 is not compatible with the scale invariance because its fourier transform generates a logarithm which requires some scale  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the vacuum polarization induced by the subcritical coulomb potential is localized at the potential center  @xcite and the analytical expression for the induced electron number @xmath19 was obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the supercritical regime @xmath20 , the stronger singularity of the coulomb potential at the origin has to be regularized , for example , by allowing a finite size for charged impurity  @xcite .",
    "however , as long as low - energy physics is concerned , all different regularization can be parametrized by a single quantity @xmath21 per supercritical angular momentum channel @xmath22 through a boundary condition on the wave function at the origin  @xcite . as we will find in eq .",
    "( [ eq : supercritical ] ) , this low - energy parameter @xmath21 with the dimension of length is defined only up to multiplicative factors of @xmath23 . as a consequence ,",
    "each supercritical channel exhibits the discrete scale invariance and the induced electron density now has a form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an unknown but log - periodic function satisfying @xmath26 with @xmath27 being an arbitrary integer .",
    "therefore , the vacuum polarization induced by the supercritical coulomb potential has a power - law tail @xmath18  @xcite whose coefficient is a sum of log - periodic functions with respect to the distance from the potential center . although the coefficient of the power - law tail was considered to be a constant in refs .",
    "@xcite , our explicit calculation will show that @xmath25 is the universal log - periodic function presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefficient ] ) .",
    "in order to determine the coefficient of the power - law tail in the induced electron density ( [ eq : tail ] ) , it is more convenient to employ a green s function method rather than directly dealing with the wave function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac ] )  @xcite .",
    "the single - particle green s function @xmath28 defined for an arbitrary @xmath29 is a solution to @xmath30 where the mass term @xmath31 is introduced to serve as an infrared cutoff and will be set to zero at the end of calculations  @xcite . by substituting its partial - wave expansion @xmath32 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : inhomo ] ) as well as the polar coordinate representation of the @xmath33 function  @xcite , we find the radial green s function @xmath34 to satisfy @xmath35 where @xmath13 is the total angular momentum quantum number .    the analytical expression for @xmath34 can be obtained in a similar way to the corresponding problem in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "we first set @xmath36^{\\mathrm{t}}\\notag\\\\   & \\quad + \\theta(r'-r)\\psi_{{\\epsilon}j}^<(r)[\\psi_{{\\epsilon}j}^>(r')]^{\\mathrm{t}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37^{\\mathrm{t}}$ ] and @xmath38^{\\mathrm{t}}$ ] being solutions to the radial dirac equation : @xmath39 these two solutions have to be normalized as @xmath40 to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : inhomo_radial ] ) and , in addition , have to be chosen so that the radial green s function @xmath34 satisfies appropriate boundary conditions at @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 fixed .",
    "it is obvious from its expression ( [ eq : green_radial ] ) that the long - distance limit is controlled by @xmath44 which has to be bounded at @xmath41 : @xmath45 on the other hand , the short - distance limit is controlled by @xmath46 whose boundary condition at @xmath42 requires different treatment for subcritical and supercritical angular momentum channels  @xcite .    in a subcritical angular momentum channel @xmath47 ,",
    "the radial dirac equation ( [ eq : dirac_radial ] ) admits regular and singular solutions @xmath48 at @xmath42 with the real exponent @xmath49 .",
    "because low - energy physics is dominated by the regular solution , the relevant boundary condition is to impose    [ eq : short - distance ] @xmath50 on the other hand , in a supercritical angular momentum channel @xmath22 , the above two solutions become oscillatory @xmath51 at @xmath42 with the imaginary exponent @xmath52 . because both solutions are now equally important to low - energy physics ,",
    "the general solution becomes their superposition which is uniquely specified by imposing the boundary condition : @xmath53    we thus find that the solution in each supercritical channel is parametrized by a single quantity @xmath54 with the dimension of length .",
    "an important point , which seems not to be fully appreciated in previous studies , is that the emergent low - energy parameter @xmath21 is defined only up to multiplicative factors of @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath56 with @xmath27 being an arbitrary integer corresponds to the same physics . as a consequence ,",
    "each supercritical channel exhibits the discrete scale invariance , which also emerges in nonrelativistic one - body  @xcite , two - body  @xcite , and three - body  @xcite problems and can be viewed as a manifestation of the quantum scale anomaly and the renormalization group limit cycle  @xcite .",
    "it is then straightforward to construct @xmath44 and @xmath46 satisfying the above required conditions ( [ eq : normalization])([eq : short - distance ] ) from the following two linearly independent solutions to the radial dirac equation ( [ eq : dirac_radial ] )  @xcite : @xmath57 \\\\    { \\mathrm{sgn}}(m)\\sqrt{m-{\\epsilon}}\\left[u_{{\\epsilon}j}^{(1,2)}(r)-v_{{\\epsilon}j}^{(1,2)}(r)\\right ]   \\end{pmatrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with    [ eq : solution1 ] @xmath58    and    [ eq : solution2 ] @xmath59    here @xmath60 is introduced , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the confluent hypergeometric functions of the first and second kind  @xcite , respectively , and @xmath63 for @xmath47 should be understood as @xmath64 when @xmath22 . by setting @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath66 the normalization condition ( [ eq : normalization ] ) and the long - distance boundary condition ( [ eq : long - distance ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the so far arbitrary prefactor @xmath67 is chosen to satisfy the short - distance boundary condition ( [ eq : short - distance ] ) , which leads to @xmath68 for a subcritical angular momentum channel @xmath47 and @xmath69 for a supercritical angular momentum channel @xmath22 . accordingly , the single - particle green s function ( [ eq : partial - wave ] ) is completely determined . for later use ,",
    "we decompose the radial green s function into two parts as @xmath70 with @xmath71^{\\mathrm{t}}\\notag\\\\   & \\quad + \\theta(r'-r)\\psi_{{\\epsilon}j}^{(1)}(r)[\\psi_{{\\epsilon}j}^{(2)}(r')]^{\\mathrm{t}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath72^{\\mathrm{t}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the low - energy parameter @xmath21 with the dimension of length appears only in the latter through @xmath67 .",
    "we are now ready to evaluate the vacuum polarization electron density ( [ eq : density ] ) , which is expressed in terms of the single - particle green s function ( [ eq : partial - wave ] ) as @xmath73}{2\\pi r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the contour of the integration over @xmath74 is deformed to coincide with the imaginary axis  @xcite .",
    "this formal expression contains divergence which has to be renormalized . in order to separate out the divergent part from the convergent part",
    ", we use the decomposition ( [ eq : decomposition ] ) to rewrite the bare electron density ( [ eq : bare ] ) as @xmath75 with @xmath76}{2\\pi r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath77}{2\\pi r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which have to be treated separately .",
    "the first part @xmath78 is divergent and thus needs the renormalization by requiring the total induced electron number to vanish  @xcite .",
    "technically , this renormalization can be performed by considering the fourier transform of the bare electron density @xmath79 with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath80 and then introducing the renormalized quantity by @xmath81 $ ] to satisfy the required neutrality condition @xmath82 . because the mass @xmath83 is the only dimensionful parameter existing in @xmath84 , the resulting dimensionless function @xmath85 can depend only on the ratio @xmath86 .",
    "accordingly , it becomes just a constant in the massless limit , @xmath87  @xcite , whose inverse fourier transform gives the cutoff ( @xmath88 ) independent renormalized electron density @xmath89 as @xmath90 which does not contribute to the power - law tail .",
    "on the other hand , the second part @xmath91 is convergent and thus does not need the renormalization because its integrand @xmath92 decreases exponentially at @xmath93 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : solution2 ] ) ] .",
    "accordingly , its contribution to the induced electron density @xmath94 can be directly evaluated by taking the massless limit and is found to have the power - law form @xmath95 with the dimensionless coefficient given by @xmath96 \\notag\\\\   & \\times e^{-z}u(-ig+i\\gamma,1 + 2i\\gamma , z)u(1-ig - i\\gamma,1 - 2i\\gamma , z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by summing up all the contributions from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : renormalized1 ] ) and ( [ eq : renormalized2 ] ) , we obtain the renormalized electron density as @xmath97 which establishes the form of the induced electron density presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tail ] ) .",
    "in particular , we find that the coefficient of the power - law tail ( [ eq : coefficient ] ) is log - periodic @xmath98 as it must be because @xmath56 with @xmath27 being an arbitrary integer corresponds to the same physics [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : supercritical ] ) ] and also universal in the sense that all microscopic details are parametrized by the single quantity @xmath54 per supercritical angular momentum channel @xmath22 . figure  [ fig : plot ] shows the obtained universal log - periodic function in the normalized form @xmath99 by taking @xmath100 and @xmath101 as an example .",
    "its mean value can be extracted by replacing the whole expression in the square bracket of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefficient ] ) with @xmath102 , which leads to @xmath103 in agreement with the constant coefficient of the power - law tail considered in ref .",
    "while @xmath25 and its mean value ( [ eq : average ] ) coincide in the limit @xmath104 , they significantly deviate especially when @xmath105 .",
    "we also note that @xmath25 is odd with respect to @xmath106 and @xmath107 is essentially the same function as @xmath25 because their apparent difference can be absorbed by redefining @xmath108 .",
    "obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefficient ] ) as a function of @xmath109 .",
    "one period in a range @xmath110 is shown for @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "dots are the exact result and the solid curve is a fit with a single sine function ; @xmath111 $ ] . [",

    "( [ eq : coefficient ] ) is fixed by the nonuniversal parameter @xmath21 which depends on microscopic physics and thus can not be determined from our perspective of low - energy effective theory .",
    "however , it can be related to other physical quantities such as the energy and width of so - called atomic collapse resonances  @xcite .",
    "although bound states can not be formed in the massless limit , it was theoretically shown that an infinite family of resonances emerges in each supercritical angular momentum channel @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "their energy and width are determined by poles of the single - particle green s function ( [ eq : partial - wave ] ) in the second riemann sheet of the complex @xmath74 plane , which can arise only as poles of the prefactor @xmath67 obtained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prefactor ] ) . by substituting @xmath112 and taking the massless limit @xmath113",
    ", we find an infinite family of complex poles at @xmath114^{\\frac1{2i\\gamma}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with multiplicative factors of @xmath55 , which leads to @xmath115 as the energy and width of the @xmath27th atomic collapse resonance .",
    "therefore , if @xmath21 for a given system is determined through the energy or width of an atomic collapse resonance ( [ eq : resonance ] ) , we then have an unambiguous prediction for the power - law tail of the vacuum polarization electron density ( [ eq : coefficient ] ) , and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , the complex expression in the square bracket of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coefficient ] ) can be greatly simplified by using the complex energy in eq .",

    "connected dots are numerical data for @xmath101 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by the exact diagonalization with @xmath119 lattice sites .",
    "the solid curve is a fit based on our prediction ( [ eq : fit ] ) with the mean value @xmath120 indicated by the horizontal dashed line .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ]    finally , it is worthwhile to compare our prediction with the induced electron density computed for the tight - binding hamiltonian on a honeycomb lattice whose low - energy physics is described by two valley species of massless dirac fermions  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp ] shows numerical data for @xmath101 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by the exact diagonalization with @xmath119 lattice sites in units of the lattice parameter @xmath118 .",
    "in addition to rapid oscillations presumably caused by the lattice cutoff , there seems to be a slow oscillation which should be contrasted with the predicted log - periodic oscillation .",
    "because only @xmath121 channels are supercritical for @xmath101 , our prediction ( [ eq : tail ] ) reduces to @xmath122 including the factor two due to the valley degeneracy . here the universal log - periodic function @xmath25 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] , can be excellently approximated by a single sine function with a relative error less than @xmath123 .",
    "accordingly , our prediction for the power - law tail of the induced electron density is expressed as @xmath124,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the amplitude @xmath125 and the phase @xmath126 are related to the unknown two low - energy parameters @xmath127 .",
    "we find in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] that the lower envelope of numerical data in the intermediate region @xmath128 between the lattice cutoff and the system radius is well fitted by choosing @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which supports the validity of our prediction .",
    "in this paper , we studied massless dirac fermions in a supercritical coulomb potential with the emphasis on that its low - energy physics is universal and each supercritical angular momentum channel exhibits the discrete scale invariance . in particular , we showed that the induced vacuum polarization has a power - law tail whose coefficient is a sum of log - periodic functions with respect to the distance from the potential center .",
    "this coefficient can also be expressed in terms of the energy and width of so - called atomic collapse resonances . while these universal features are explicitly demonstrated only in two dimensions",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : renormalized2])([eq : relation ] ) ] , it is straightforward to extend our present analysis to three dimensions as well . therefore , qualitatively the same features are indeed expected in the vacuum polarization caused by a superheavy atomic nucleus with @xmath1 as long as ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs ( i.e. , nuclear charge radius and electron compton wavelength , respectively ) are well separated compared to log - periodic oscillations , which shed new light on the longstanding fundamental problem of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "furthermore , because low - energy physics of graphene is described by massless dirac fermions in two dimensions , our universal predictions on the vacuum polarization and its relationship to observed atomic collapse resonances  @xcite can in principle be tested experimentally by measuring the induced electron density with scanning probe microscopy techniques  @xcite .",
    "while the electron - electron interaction has been neglected in our present analysis , our novel finding on the vacuum polarization may be useful to develop further insight into the screening of the supercritical coulomb impurity in the presence of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "one possible approach is to write down the self - consistent renormalization group equation in the same spirit as ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath131_{z\\to z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(r)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 multiplied by @xmath133 is the total charge within the radius @xmath134 . because the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : screening ] ) is negative , the total charge decreases as the radius increases until the right hand side vanishes , i.e. , @xmath135 , which leads to the screening of the supercritical charge down to the critical value  @xcite .",
