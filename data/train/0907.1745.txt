    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) due to electronic correlations has been subject of intense research for several decades .",
    "the nis@xmath1se@xmath2 series provided an important model system exhibiting a mit controlled by varying the se content @xmath3 , temperature @xmath4 or pressure @xmath5 @xcite . particularly interesting",
    "is the similarity of the @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 phase diagrams @xcite to that of the hubbard model in the infinite dimension limit @xcite , consisting in the presence of the phase transition between paramagnetic metal and paramagnetic insulator at intermediate temperatures , existence of the high - temperature crossover regime , and the possibility of driving a metal insulating , in a certain range of @xmath3 , by increasing the temperature .",
    "consequently , the mit has been commonly attributed to broadening of the ni-@xmath8 band @xcite . despite a large volume of available experimental data , the microscopic origin of the mit in nis@xmath1se@xmath2",
    "is poorly understood and a satisfactory material - specific theory is missing .",
    "ni@xmath9@xmath0 ( @xmath9=s , se ) can be viewed as nio with the o atom replaced by an @xmath9@xmath0 dimer .",
    "strong hybridization between the @xmath10 orbitals pointing along the @xmath11 dimer , @xmath12 orbitals , leads to a formation of split bonding and anti - bonding bands ( the latter ones are referred to as @xmath13 ) , which accommodate two holes leading to an @xmath9@xmath14 valence state .",
    "numerous photoemission ( pes ) studies @xcite complemented by cluster calculations @xcite revealed a similarity between the ni@xmath9@xmath0 and nio valence band ( vb ) spectra , supporting this analogy .",
    "the bandstructure calculations in the local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite rendered nis@xmath0 a metal with a partially filled @xmath15 band and empty @xmath13 orbitals . by analogy to nio it was speculated that local @xmath16 correlations open a gap between the s-@xmath17 band and the upper hubbard band of ni-@xmath8 @xmath15 character @xcite , leading to the classification of nis@xmath0 as a charge - transfer ( ct ) insulator in the zaanen - sawatzky - allen ( zsa ) scheme @xcite , although in the original zsa paper nis@xmath0 was classified as @xmath17-type metal were it not for the gap between the s @xmath13 and the rest of the @xmath17 band.    we have combined theoretical calculations with new experimental data in order to address the following questions : i ) why is nis@xmath0 an insulator and nise@xmath0 a metal ? ,",
    "ii ) how do ni@xmath9@xmath0 respond to external pressure ?",
    ", iii ) are the effects of pressure and varying se content equivalent ? ,",
    "iv ) what is the mechanism of the mit in nis@xmath1se@xmath2 ?",
    "the electronic structure of ni@xmath9@xmath0 is studied numerically , using a combination of the _ ab initio _ bandstructure and the approximation of the dynamical mean - field theory ( lda+dmft ) @xcite .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) reflectivity is measured on samples with various se concentrations under applied pressure to investigate the evolution of the optical gap and the spectral weight transfer .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) at s k - edge is used to elucidate the orbital character of features in the single - particle spectrum of nis@xmath0 .",
    "our computations proceed as follows .",
    "first , we perform paramagnetic lda calculations @xcite and minimize the total energy to find the equilibrium s(se ) positions . next , we represent the one - particle hilbert space of the hybridized ni-@xmath8 and s(se)-@xmath17 bands in wannier basis ( 44 orbitals per unit cell ) and calculate the parameters of the on - site @xmath16 interaction with the constraint lda approach @xcite .",
    "we found only moderately different @xmath18  ev and @xmath19  ev and used @xmath20 of 1  ev throughout the study .",
    "finally , we construct a multi - band hubbard hamiltonian @xmath21 and compute the single - particle spectra using the dmft approximation . here , @xmath22 is the lda hamiltonian , 44@xmath2344 matrices ( four nix@xmath0 units ) in the basis of ni-@xmath8 and x-@xmath17 wannier orbitals , on a uniform @xmath24-mesh in the first brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the second term is the double - counting correction amounting to a constant shift applied to ni-@xmath8 site energies @xcite .",
    "the last term is the two - particle interaction at the ni sites in the density - density approximation .",
    "the dmft equations are solved on the matsubara contour . the continuous time quantum monte - carlo impurity solver @xcite is employed to solve the auxiliary multi - orbital impurity problem .",
    "single - particle spectral densities are obtained by analytic continuation of monte - carlo data using the maximum entropy method @xcite .",

    "single crystals , grown by vapor transport technique , were slightly polished in order to obtain a clean , mirror - like surface .",
    "near - normal incidence reflectivity was measured with a cassegrainian - based ir microscope coupled to a michelson interferometer .",
    "the nis@xmath1se@xmath25 series ( x=0 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 ) was studied at ambient conditions , a clamp diamond anvil cell ( diacell cryodac - mega ) equipped with type iia diamonds was employed to perform pressure dependent studies . a small piece of nis@xmath0 ( nis@xmath26se@xmath27 ) was cut and placed together with csi ( as hydrostatic medium ) inside a 400 @xmath28 m hole drilled in a 90 @xmath28 m thick cube gasket .",
    "the pressure was evaluated in situ , by the standard ruby - fluorescence technique.@xcite measurements were carried out partly at the university of augsburg and partly at the ir1 beamline in anka , so to exploit the high brilliance of synchrotron radiation in the far - ir range .",
    "we recall that due to the small size of the samples inside the diamond anvil cell measurements as a function of pressure were performed for @xmath29250 @xmath30 .",
    "the measurement procedure , as well as the data processing to extract the optical conductivity @xmath31 are carefully described in refs . .",
    "the sulfur 1s x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) spectra which provides information about vacant s 3p - states were measured at the soft x - ray microcharacterization beamline ( sxrmb ) at the canadian light source .",
    "the spectra were measured in total electron yield ( tey ) mode .",
    "additional measurements were taken in total fluorescence ( tfy ) mode using a channel - plate detector , and partial fluorescence ( pfy ) mode using a silicon drift detector with a resolution of about 100 ev .",
    "both the pfy and tfy measurements showed the same features as the tey measurements , indicating that the surface of the samples was clean .",
    "the tey measurements were used for the analysis because they had a better signal - to - noise ratio than the tfy or pfy measurements , and did not suffer from the self - absorption effects present in the fluorescence measurements .",
    "an si(111 ) crystal was used in the monochromator , and the experimental resolution ( e / e ) was about 10000 .",
    "we start the exposition of our results with a brief review of the non - interacting lda bandstructures , which agree with those published previously @xcite .",
    "the ni-@xmath8 orbitals form narrow @xmath32 and broader , ni - x anti - bonding , @xmath33 bands due to octahedral coordination of ni with the chalcogen x. the deviations from an exact octahedral symmetry at the ni sites lead to further splitting of the @xmath32 bands into an @xmath34 doublet and an @xmath35 singlet .",
    "this splitting plays no discernible role in our investigation .",
    "the characteristic feature of the chalcogen bands is a large bonding ",
    "anti - bonding splitting of the @xmath17-orbitals pointing along the x - x dimer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : str ] ) . due to the s - s - ni angle being close to the right angle ( @xmath36104 deg in nis@xmath0 )",
    "the dimer states hybridize only weakly with the ni @xmath33 states .",
    "the ni - x and x - x dimer distances as function of the lattice constant were obtained by minimization of the lda total energies ( see fig .  [",

    "the calculated nis@xmath0 bond lengths agree well with experimental observations .",
    "compression leads to shortening of the ni - s distance while the s - s dimer behaves as a rigid object .",
    "the situation is less clear in nise@xmath0 . while the calculated ambient pressure ni - se bond length reproduces the experimental value , the length of the se - se dimer is substantially overestimated . under pressure",
    "our calculations yield an initial increase of the se - se indicating that the ni - se bond becomes stronger relative to the se - se bond and suggesting that se - se dimer can not be viewed as a molecular unit .",
    "we will discuss later on how the behavior of the bond lengths affects the electronic properties .        in this section",
    "we present orbitally resolved spectral densities obtained at ambient pressure with the lda+dmft method . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nis2 ] we show the nis@xmath0 spectra , which exhibit a small charge gap in agreement with experimental observations . the valence band ( vb ) resembles that of nio @xcite with the characteristic distribution of the ni-@xmath8 spectral weight between @xmath37 ( around -6 ev ) and @xmath38 excitations ( at low binding energy ) , the result of a strong @xmath39 hybridization .",
    "overall , a good correspondence between positions of the main features in the experimental x - ray photoemission spectra ( xps ) and their theoretical counterparts can be stated . particularly important for",

    "the identification of @xmath41 with the upper hubbard band is based on the observation of its shift upon increasing the interaction strength ( see the inset of fig . [",
    "fig : nis2 ] ) and the absence of @xmath17 character .",
    "the experimental cb spectrum , obtained with the bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy ( bis ) of ref . , exhibits three distinct features : a sharp low - energy peak at 1 ev , a high - energy peak at 3.5  ev and a broad band ( @xmath42 ) starting around 5.5  ev .",

    "the orbital character of the other two peaks is of key importance for understanding the nature of the charge gap .",
    "the question can be formulated simply as : is the upper hubbard band located below or above the @xmath13 band ? the authors of ref . interpreted the 1  ev as ni-@xmath8 upper hubbard band and the 3.5  ev peak as s @xmath13 band , which is a clear contradiction to our result .",

    "since the bonding  anti - bonding splitting between the vb bottom and the @xmath13 peak is essentially a molecular property of the se - se dimer , it does not depend on the value of @xmath43 .      to analyze the behavior of the @xmath13 band we have calculated the bare @xmath17 bandstructures , obtained by decoupling the ni-@xmath8 states",
