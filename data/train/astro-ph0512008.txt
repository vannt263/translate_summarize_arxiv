    "the two main ingredients used to predict the agn number counts and contribution to the x - ray background are : ( _ i_)the agn luminosity function and its evolution .",
    "we used the luminosity function of @xcite , which is based on hard x - ray observations and thus relatively free of bias against obscured agn .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the agn sed , in terms of intrinsic luminosity and neutral hydrogen column density ( @xmath5 ) along the line of sight .",
    "we assumed an underlying power - law x - ray spectrum ( e@xmath60.5 kev ) with photon index of @xmath7 1.9 , typical of unobscured agn . in the optical ( @xmath8=0.1 - 1 microns ) , we used the sloan digital sky survey composite quasar spectrum @xcite plus milky - way - type reddening laws and a standard dust - to - gas ratio to convert @xmath5 to @xmath9 .",
    "an l * elliptical host galaxy was then added to the resulting optical spectrum . in the infrared ( @xmath101 micron ) we used dust emission models by @xcite with the corresponding conversion from @xmath5 value to viewing angle .",
    "agn models with the same intrinsic luminosities were normalized at 100 microns .",
    "the standard x - ray to optical luminosity ratio was used to fix the scale of the different models .",
    "using the simplest agn unification model we have explained the spectral shape and intensity of the x - ray background .",
    "this is the first demonstration that a model assuming a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured agn , independent of redshift or luminosity , can simultaneously explain the observed x - ray background and the optical and x - ray counts of agn detected in deep x - ray surveys @xcite . at the same time , a model that incorporates a changing ratio with luminosity , as suggested by recently available observations ( fig .",

    "the maximum contribution to the x - ray background comes from sources with log lx=43 - 44 , that is , moderate luminosity agn.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the integral constraint of the x - ray background clearly does not provide a sensitive probe of the fraction of the obscured agn ; other observations , in particular a high - flux x - ray sample ( @xmath11  erg  @xmath12  s@xmath13 ) with a very high spectroscopic completeness level ( @xmath690% ) , is needed to test whether the ratio depends on redshift , i.e. , whether the evolution of obscured and unobscured agn is different . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , unification by orientation  in which obscured and unobscured agn have the same evolution  is consistent with the data . in order to obtain this highly complete sample , accurate redshifts for sources with optical magnitudes",
    "@xmath14 are needed .",
    "this is impossible with current state - of - the - art 8m - class telescopes .",
    "however , good photometric redshifts using medium - band filters down to these magnitudes are possible and will allow to solve the redshift dependence problem .",
    "the resolved fraction of the x - ray background is @xmath15 in the 7 - 10 kev band and decreases with increasing energy .",
    "if the unification model presented here is correct , @xmath16% of agn are currently missed by deep _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm _ surveys .",
    "these are very obscured agn that will be detected only by hard x - ray observatories , like the black hole finder probe , at x - ray energies where the effects of dust obscuration are negligible .",
    "these surveys will detect a large fraction of the most obscured agn , providing for the first time an unbiased census of the black hole activity in the universe .",
