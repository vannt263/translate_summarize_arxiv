    "<S> we use quantum monte carlo simulations to study a finite - temperature dimensional - crossover - driven evolution of spin and charge dynamics in an anisotropic two - dimensional system of weakly coupled hubbard chains with a half - filled band . </S>",
    "<S> the low - temperature behavior of the charge gap indicates a crossover between two distinct energy scales : a high - energy one - dimensional ( 1d ) mott gap due to the umklapp process and a low - energy gap which stems from long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> away from the 1d regime and at temperature scales above the charge gap , the emergence of a zero - frequency drude - like feature in the interchain optical conductivity @xmath0 implies the onset of a higher - dimensional metal . in this metallic phase , enhanced quasiparticle scattering off finite - range af spin fluctuations results in incoherent single - particle dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between spin and charge fluctuations is also seen in the spin dynamical structure factor @xmath1 displaying damped spin excitations ( paramagnons ) close to the af wave - vector @xmath2 and particle - hole continua near 1d momentum transfers spanning quasiparticles at the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> we relate our results to the charge deconfinement in quasi-1d organic bechgaard - fabre salts . </S>"
