    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction proceeds via the meson exchange , and therefore the existence of many - particle @xmath3 forces is a natural consequence of nonlinearity of the strong interaction theory .",
    "indeed , only two - particle forces , fig.1a , are possible in the lowest order of linear theory containing only quadratic terms of the meson field @xmath4 in the meson lagrangian density .",
    "the situation is different in nonlinear theories . in the theory with @xmath5 terms",
    "the meson may turn into two ones thus giving rise to three - particle forces , fig.1b , in addition to the pairing ones . in the same way the lowest - order four - particle forces , fig.1c , appear in the theory with @xmath6 terms .",
    "no higher - power terms exist in renormalizable theories , but the branching of meson is possible in higher orders thus giving rise to higher @xmath3 forces , fig.1d .",
    "for this reason the empirical information on many - particle forces is of fundamental importance for the physics of strong interactions .    at present the only such information is provided by the calculations for the few - nucleon systems . according to these calculations something",
    "should be added to the two - particle @xmath3 forces to get the agreement between the calculated and observed quantities . in practice",
    "only three - particle forces are added ( see ref.@xcite and the references therein ) since the problem is difficult even in this case .",
    "indeed , the forces are characterized by a number of adjustable parameters describing the strength , range , the spin - isospin structure etc . , and",
    "the observed quantities are expressed through these parameters in all orders of the perturbation theory . in such conditions",
    "it is hardly possible to distinguish , for instance , between the genuine three - particle interaction and the combination of the latter with the four - particle one .    as shown in the present paper such possibility may be provided by the experimental data on nuclear single - particle states .",
    "it is based on the facts that ( a )  the contribution of the two - particle @xmath3 forces to the nuclear single - particle potential is fixed by experiment and ( b )  no correlation effects contribute to the single - particle energies @xcite . for these reasons",
    "the many - particle contribution may be detected by comparing the observed energies of single - particle states with the calculations including the two - particle @xmath3 forces only .",
    "we are using the untraditional approach by m.baranger @xcite .",
    "it is based on the spectral representation for the single - particle propagator @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ground - state wave function of nucleus @xmath9 which is chosen to be even - even the ground state thus being nondegenerate , @xmath10 the sums over @xmath11 and @xmath12 thus running over complete sets of states of @xmath13 and @xmath14 nuclei .",
    "the short - time behaviour of a particle or hole which is suddenly created in the ground state @xmath8 is described by the following relations @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the single - particle states are treated as eigenstates of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath18 , eq.(4 ) , @xmath19 thus being the doorway states for the single - nucleon transfer reactions@xcite . as a result of the correlation effects",
    "these states are distributed over actual states of both the @xmath13 and @xmath14 nuclei .",
    "however the properties of the distribution process permit the determination of the single - particle energies from the experimental data . introducing the spectroscopic factors @xmath20 multiplying eqs .",
    "( 3)(5 ) by @xmath21 and integrating over @xmath22 and @xmath23 we get @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 the determination of single - particle energies by using the eqs .",
    "( 3a)(5a ) and ( 8) will be discussed in subsect.3.2 .",
    "the ref.@xcite derivation of the explicit form of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath28 should be specified by taking into account the meson - exchange nature of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "first , the contemporary meson - exchange forces such as the obe @xcite , paris @xcite and bonn @xcite have no hard repulsive core , and therefore the problem of elimination of short - range correlations ( see the discussion in ref.@xcite ) does not really exist .",
    "so there are no actual reasons preventing from a direct use of bare @xmath3 forces for nuclear structure calculations ( i.e. the preliminary calculation of the brueckner @xmath29-matrix @xcite or some different way of the hard core elimination is not necessary ) .",
    "second , the commutator technique of ref.@xcite does not apply in this case because of the retardation . for this reason the field - theoretical approach @xcite",
    "should be used instead . in this approach the single - particle green function @xmath30 obeys the dyson equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the kinetic energy and the mass operator @xmath33 consists of the energy - independent part @xmath34 , which is just the nuclear single - particle potential , and the energy - dependent one @xmath35 which is responsible for the correlation effects : @xmath36 as shown in refs.@xcite the quantity @xmath35 vanishes in the @xmath37 limit @xmath38 ( the dots in the rhs are the higher - power terms of @xmath39 ) and therefore @xmath40 the decomposition ( 11 ) thus being unambiguous .",
    "let us show that the single - particle hamiltonian of eq.(4 ) is @xmath41 whereas the quantity @xmath42 of eq.(5 ) is defined by eq.(12 ) .",
    "first let us note that according to the time - energy heisenberg relation the infinite @xmath43 value is equivalent to the infinitely short time interval , the eqs.(13 ) and ( 14 ) thus meaning that the hamiltonian @xmath28 is indeed responsible for the short - time behaviour of the particle ( hole ) .",
    "now let us use the spectral representation @xcite @xmath44 and the identity @xmath45 in the @xmath46 limit .",
    "putting eq.(16 ) into eq.(15 ) we get the following asymptotic expansion @xmath47 the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 being just the lhs of eqs .",
    "( 3),(4 ) and ( 5 ) respectively . as seen from eqs.(11),(12 ) and",
    "( 14 ) the dyson equation ( 10 ) may be written in the form @xmath50 putting eq.(17 ) into eq.(18 ) we again get eqs.(3)(5 ) , but now the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath51 are determined .    in terms of bare @xmath3 forces ( for a moment",
    "let us take into account the pairing forces only ) the single - particle potential is defined by the first - order diagrams of fig.2 provided the nucleons interact without the retardation @xcite .",
    "this is however not the case for the meson - exchange forces including both the momentum and the energy transfer . as a result of the latter the exchange diagrams of fig.2b have the @xmath52 asymptotics thus contributing to the quantity @xmath35 rather than @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate this for the bonn @xmath53 potential @xcite .",
    "it is the sum of the terms @xmath54 in the four - momentum space , the form of the meson - nucleon vertices being specified by the lorentz symmetry of the mesons .",
    "the latter is however disregarded because it is irrelevant for the energy dependence . with this remark",
    "the expression for the fig.2b diagram becomes @xmath55 considering the case of the monopole formfactor , @xmath56 , and using the identity @xmath57 we get @xmath58\\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{-1cm}-\\left .",

    "we get @xmath59dq\\ .\\ ] ] the integral is convergent because the integrand has the @xmath60 asymptotics .",
    "in addition to fig.2b the quantity @xmath35 includes an infinite sum of higher - order feynman diagrams describing all kinds of the correlation effects ( pauli , particle  particle , particle  hole , ground  state etc . ) .",
    "thus the only contribution to the nuclear single - particle potential is provided by the hartree diagrams of fig.2a and the hartree - like ones of fig.3 resulting from the many - particle @xmath3 forces , the single - particle energies thus being free of the correlation effects .",
    "the latter is the feature of the ref.@xcite approach , thus permitting the model - independent studies of nuclear structure .",
    "the fig.2a contribution to the single - particle potential is the convolution of the two - particle @xmath3 forces with the nucleon density distribution in nucleus .",
    "the latter is determined by the combined analysis of electron - nucleus and 1 gev proton - nucleus elastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "the two - particle forces are determined from the deuteron properties and the elastic @xmath3 scattering phase shifts at the energies below the pion production threshold . in this way the `` pairing '' contribution to nuclear single - particle potential is fixed by the experimental data thus being independent of any nuclear model .    we have chosen the bonn @xmath53 potential @xcite for the two - particle forces , the motivation being discussed in sect.4 .",
    "this choice enables us to check the status of nuclear relativity @xcite by calculating the scalar and vector fields in nuclear interior . using the parameters of table 5 from ref.@xcite and the equilibrium nuclear matter density value @xmath61 @xmath62 we get @xcite @xmath63 these values are close to those provided by the dirac phenomenology @xcite . in such conditions it is reasonable to treat the single - particle wave functions @xmath64 as dirac bispinors obeying the dirac equation .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian resulting from the bonn @xmath53 potential is @xcite @xmath65 @xmath66 is the free nucleon mass , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are dirac matrices .",
    "the scalar field @xmath69 consists of the isoscalar and isovector parts resulting from the exchange by @xmath70 and @xmath71 mesons .",
    "in addition to the isoscalar and isovector parts resulting from the exchange by @xmath72 and @xmath73 mesons the vector field @xmath74 includes the coulomb potential . the small isovector quantity @xmath75 results from the tensor part of the @xmath73 meson - nucleon coupling .",
    "the details of the calculations are described in ref.@xcite .",
    "they also may be found in the extensive literature on the walecka model @xcite , see for instance ref.@xcite .",
    "the dirac equation @xmath76 is equivalent to schrdinger - like one for a particle with the effective mass @xmath77 in the central @xmath78 and spin - orbit potentials @xcite @xmath79 the terms arising from the quantity @xmath75 are omitted here , but actually they are taken into account in the calculations .",
    "the quantities in eqs.(24)(28 ) should be supplied by the subscript `` pair '' since they describe the contribution from the two - particle forces .",
    "the contribution from the many - particle forces is looked for as the following expansion in terms of the nucleon density distribution @xmath80 @xmath81\\ ] ] the @xmath82 term results from three - particle forces , fig.3a , the @xmath83 one is of four - particle origin , fig.3b , etc .",
    "( the linear density terms enter the two - particle contribution , eq.(27 ) ) .",
    "the potential @xmath84 is assumed to be equally distributed between the scalar and vector fields , @xmath85 the only motivation for this assumption is the aim to have as little free parameters as possible .      as mentioned in sect.2",
    "the single - particle energies may be determined from experiment by using the sum rules ( 3a)(5a ) .",
    "the most suitable situation is that for the cases when the absolute value of the single - particle energy @xmath86 exceeds the width @xmath87 of the distribution region . in these cases all states ,",
    "over which the single - particle one is distributed , belong to the same nucleus , and therefore the sum rules ( 3a)(5a ) are saturated by only one term in the lhs , the first for the hole states and the second for the particle ones .",
    "such situation occurs for the peaks in the cross sections of quasielastic knockout reactions @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xcite leading to the hole states with @xmath90 indeed , according to eq.(8 ) the width @xmath87 depends on the single - particle wave function @xmath91 rather than the energy @xmath92 , thus being roughly the same for all single - particle states .",
    "so it is reasonable to identify @xmath70 with the largest observed value @xmath93 mev .",
    "the latter is the width of the peaks corresponding to the @xmath94 hole states . for these reasons",
    "the average energies of the above peaks obeying the eq.(31 ) condition may be identified with the single - particle energies within the experimental accuracy of @xmath95 mev . in this way we demonstrated that the ref.@xcite approach permits the model - independent determination of the single - particle energies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the experimental data for the @xmath96 energies are independent of those for the two - particle contribution to the @xmath96 potential .",
    "we used the facts that the cross section of the quasielastic knockout reaction leading to the fixed nuclear state is proportional to the spectroscopic factor of this state , and the absolute values of the @xmath97-factors are not necessary when all states , over which the single - particle one is distributed , belong to the same nucleus ( in this case the relative values are sufficient ) .",
    "this is however not the case for weakly bound single - particle states with @xmath98 .",
    "such states are distributed over actual ones of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 nuclei , and therefore the @xmath97-factors from both the pickup and stripping reactions are necessary .",
    "but the @xmath97-factors are determined with a rather low accuracy because of both experimental and theoretical ambiguities , and therefore it is unclear how to pin together the @xmath97-factors from the two reactions . for these reasons",
    "the energies of weakly bound single - particle states are yet unknown .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the low - lying states of @xmath99 nuclei forming the fermi - surface of the closed - shell nucleus @xmath9 are landau ",
    "migdal quasiparticles @xcite rather than the single - particle states of nucleon .",
    "indeed , the correlation term @xmath35 is included in the quasiparticle energies in contrast to the single - particle ones , see ref.@xcite for details .",
    "the observed energies of neutron and proton single - particle states in @xmath1zr are plotted in fig.4 together with the results of the calculations .",
    "as seen from the figure the lowest `` pair '' states @xmath94 are significantly underbound whereas the higher states , especially the @xmath100 ones , are overbound .",
    "the same compression of `` pair '' single - particle states occurs in @xmath2pb , fig.5 , where this effect is even more pronounced , and also in @xmath0ca , fig.6 .",
    "this means that the potential well , including two - particle forces only , is somewhat too wide but insufficiently deep .",
    "the isoscalar potentials in @xmath1zr , `` pair '' , actual and the many - particle contribution , are plotted in fig.7 . as seen from the figure , the many - particle contribution ( i.e. the difference between the actual and `` pair '' wells ) consists of the repulsive and attractive parts , the radius of the latter being less than that of the former .",
    "so the expansion ( 29 ) has to contain at least two terms of different sign obeying the above condition . the most simple possibility is provided by the sum of the three - particle repulsion , @xmath101 , and the four - particle attraction , @xmath102 .",
    "of course we can not guarantee the absence of contributions from higher many - particle forces .",
    "it only should be mentioned that the above possibility corresponds to the least number of free parameters .",
    "taking into account the possible contribution of many - particle forces to the isovector nuclear potential the quantity @xmath84 is chosen as @xmath103\\rho^-(r)\\bigg\\}\\ ,    \\nonumber\\\\ \\rho(r ) & = & \\rho_n(r)+\\rho_p(r)\\ , \\quad \\rho^-(r)\\ = \\",

    "is improved by including the many - particle contribution .",
    "the results , which are labelled as `` tot '' in fig.4 , are obtained using the woods  saxon - like density distributions of ref.@xcite which are folded with the nucleon electromagnetic form factor , see ref.@xcite for details",
    ". however the nuclear potential is expressed through the point densities since the finite size of nucleon is taken into account in the @xmath3 forces .",
    "for this reason we used the point densities @xmath106 which are obtained from those of ref.@xcite by usual deconvolution procedure",
    ".    it should be mentioned that the electron and proton elastic scattering data underlying these densities are sensitive to nucleon density distributions in the surface region of nucleus , whereas the single - particle energies are sensitive to those in nuclear interior .",
    "therefore the observed single - particle energies may be used to specify the nucleon density distributions .",
    "we tried many different forms of @xmath80 .",
    "the most appropriate one is found to be @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the fourth order hermite function .",
    "the best fit parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 of neutron and proton density distributions are shown in table 1 .",
    "the best fit strength parameters are found to be the same for all nuclei .",

    "the largest discrepancy between the observed single - particle energies and the `` tot1 '' results for @xmath1zr and @xmath0ca as well as the `` tot2 '' ones for @xmath2pb is less than 3 mev , the average discrepancy is 1.65 mev .",
    "the specified nucleon density distributions are plotted in figs.8 and 9 .",
    "as seen from the figures the neutron densities have a pronounced dip in the center of nucleus which increases with increasing mass number .",
    "we also calculated the 1 gev proton elastic scattering cross sections within the glauber ",
    "sitenko theory @xcite using both the specified densities and those of ref.@xcite .",
    "the results , see fig.10 , clearly show that the agreement with experiment is equally good for both the ref.@xcite and the specified densities .",
    "the possible reasons for the difference between the eq.(34 ) and the eq.(35 ) strength parameters are as follows .",
    "( i )  expression ( 32 ) corresponds to the zero - range forces @xmath114 whereas the actual forces may be of finite range .",
    "( ii )  the above forces should have been folded with the two - particle density and the three - particle one rather than the products of single - particle densities .",
    "( iii )  as mentioned above , the contributions from higher many - particle forces may be present .",
    "the difference is however small for the charge - symmetric nuclear matter with the equilibrium density @xmath61  @xmath62 . indeed , as follows from eqs .",
    "( 32),(34 ) and ( 35 ) the contributions of three(four)-particle forces to the isoscalar single - particle potentials are @xmath115 the first values in the rhs correspond to the eq.(34 ) parameters whereas those in parentheses refer to the eq.(35 ) set .",
    "they are not small compared to the `` pair '' value @xmath116  mev , see eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 27 ) .",
    "but they nearly compensate each other thus giving rise to the conclusion that the isoscalar part of the nuclear single - particle potential is mainly of the two - particle origin .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that according to eq.(30 ) @xmath117 thus being considerably less than the pair values @xmath118  mev , @xmath119  mev , see eq.(24 ) .",
    "the situation is different for the isovector part of the potential . with @xmath120 eq.(32 )",
    "gives @xmath121 for both eq.(34 ) and eq.(35 ) parameters whereas the `` pair '' value provided by the bonn @xmath53 potential is @xmath122mev , the isovector nuclear potential thus being mainly of many - particle origin .",
    "the reason is due to the fact that the two - particle contribution arises from the exchange by isovector mesons @xmath73 and @xmath71 which are weakly coupled to nucleon @xcite .",
    "in this way we demonstrated that the many - particle @xmath3 interaction includes at least the three - particle repulsion and the four - particle attraction . this result is restricted because no information is obtained for the many - particle forces which do not contribute to the nuclear single - particle potential .",
    "but it provides a very instructive example of the situation where the experimental data on complex nuclei are more appropriate for the fundamental problem than those on few - nucleon systems .",
    "indeed , the latter ones are described by solving the complicated many - particle quantum mechanical problem including the interaction in all orders of the perturbation theory . on the contrary",
    "the single - particle states are solutions of the one - particle problem which is much more simple .",
    "in addition the nuclear single - particle potential is expressed through the @xmath3 interaction in first order of the perturbation theory , the result thus being visual ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "they are essentially based on the choice of the bonn potential for the two - particle @xmath3 forces .",
    "the reason for this choice is a very high level of confidence : ( a )  the physics underlying the bonn potential is absolutely clear , ( b )  it contains only one adjustable parameter , ( c )  the two - nucleon data are described with @xmath123datum=1.9 @xcite ( according to this reference the bonn @xmath53 version we used in the present work is completely equivalent to the full one ) .    of course our results",
    "may be changed with the progress of the knowledge about the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "we insist however that the acceptable new - fashioned potential must be of higher level of confidence than the bonn one .",
    "this means that ( a )  the underlying physics should be as clear as that for the bonn potential , ( b )  the number of free parameters may be also only one but the @xmath124/datum value should be considerably less or ( c )  the @xmath124/datum value may be the same but no free parameters should be present .    \\2 . in the ref.@xcite experiments the energy of the knocked - out nucleon is only about 100 mev",
    ". this may be insufficient to neglect the final - state inelastic interactions leading to additional excitation of the final nucleus . as a result of such excitations the average energies of the peaks",
    "may be shifted from the single - particle energy values because the reaction mechanism is not a pure quasielastic knockout in this case .",
    "to get rid of this ambiguity the additional quasielastic knockout @xmath125 or @xmath126 experiments are desired in which the energy of the knocked - out nucleon would be about 1 gev .",
