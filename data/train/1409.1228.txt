    "furthermore , for abell 2744 the critical curve for lensing @xmath2 galaxies runs partially through the icl , which may significantly reduce the chance of finding highly magnified galaxies in standard sextractor catalogs due to blending with the icl and spurious detections .    in order to mitigate some of this effect",

    "as we show below it is crucial to include lensing shear and magnification - dependent completeness when deriving lensed number densities of galaxies .",
    "we do this by taking shear into account to first order using the shear tensor to compute the tangential and radial magnification as well as the direction of the shear angle ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a representative gray errorbar on the left shows the 1@xmath98 dispersion in the relation across the image . while lensing preserves surface brightness , highly sheared sources are spread out over many pixels resulting in a lower detection probability .",
    "the assumed size distribution has thus a significant impact on the expected completeness as shown by the gray dashed line where no size scaling with luminosity was assumed . even in the absence of shear , however , magnified sources have reduced completeness due to blending with foreground galaxies and intra - cluster light as shown with the dashed red line .",

    "the colors represent different light profiles ( @xmath80 blue , @xmath81 red ) .",
    "as seen in the previous figure , the impact of the assumption on the light profile is noticeable , but relatively small .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the reduced relative completeness for highly magnified galaxies with @xmath100 mag is mostly dominated by blending with foreground galaxies , while shear impacts sources at @xmath101 mag , i.e. about 1.5 mag from the nominal completeness limit of the data . ]",
    "figure [ fig : posdepcompleteness ] shows the relative detection completeness for galaxies in the observed magnitude range @xmath59 mag as a function of position in the cluster field .",
    "the completeness is normalized to the median found in areas of the image with @xmath60 ( 15% of the image ) , where the absolute completeness is @xmath61 .    while the relative completeness decreases significantly around brighter sources in the field due to blending , it is clearly apparent that the completeness is also reduced around the critical curve of the cluster where no bright foreground sources are present . in those areas of the image ,",
    "the main reason for the reduced completeness is shear and magnification . even though lensing conserves surface brightness , a source which is highly magnified above the survey detection limit is spread over many more pixels than a non - sheared source at the same observed magnitude , reducing its s / n and detection probability .",
    "the relative completeness as a function of magnification averaged over the whole cluster field is shown in figure [ fig : magdepcompleteness ] .",
    "as expected , we find a significant decrease in completeness toward higher magnification .",
    "even though the scatter is significant in this relation , a source magnified by @xmath102 has on average a @xmath103 lower chance of being detected and included in a high - redshift catalog compared to a source which is only magnified by @xmath60 .",
    "however , as already pointed out , magnification - dependent completeness is present even when ignoring shear and magnification , simply due to blending with bright cluster galaxies closer to the critical curves ( red dashed line in fig . [",

    "the shear adds to the incompleteness on top of this by a factor @xmath104 .",

    "using our default scaling of @xmath95 , we find that very highly magnified sources are up to a factor @xmath105 more complete than assuming no size scaling at all .",
    "the large discrepancy between these two estimates , however , shows that accurate size scaling relations are necessary to accurately compute the selection volumes of high - redshift galaxies , adding to the uncertainties in lfs estimated from cluster fields .",
    "one possible strategy for mitigating these uncertainties is to use a differential technique to derive the relative normalization of the uv lf in various redshift bins from their relative surface densities ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is based on the assumption that the sizes and surface brightness profiles of galaxies in different redshift intervals are largely self - similar vs. luminosity",
    ". however , these assumptions in deriving the lf evolution need to be properly tested and calibrated .    figure [ fig : magdepcompleteness ] also shows the impact of our assumption on the distribution of galaxy light profiles . if we simulate only sersic @xmath80 exponential disk profiles , the resulting completeness is slightly reduced ( by @xmath106 at @xmath92 ) compared to the steeper @xmath81 light profile .",
    "clearly , the impact of a size - luminosity relation is thus significantly more important , and it will be crucial to accurately determine this with future observations .    finally , figure [ fig : completenessfmag ] shows the magnification - dependent completeness as a function of observed magnitude and galaxy profile .",
    "this demonstrates that the drop in completeness at high magnification seen in figure [ fig : magdepcompleteness ] is mostly driven by sources with @xmath107 mag , i.e. @xmath131.5 mag brighter than our 5@xmath98 detection limit . for sources with observed magnitudes brighter than this , the reduced completeness at higher magnification is mostly dominated by blending with the bright foreground cluster galaxies .",
    "we stress that the completeness estimates derived here only apply to galaxy catalogs using standard source detection algorithms",
    ". it may be possible to increase the source completeness around the critical curves with the use of a smoothing kernel adapted to the expected shear .",
    "furthermore , our calculations assume idealized light profiles .",
    "clumpy substructure in galaxies may further increase their detection probability . quantifying these effects",

    "given our assumed uv lf with a faint - end slope of @xmath120 the cluster field would thus be expected to show a significantly larger number of high - redshift sources at all magnitudes . however , once we include magnification - dependent completeness , the cluster field in fact shows a very similar total number of expected images of @xmath2 galaxy candidates as the blank field ( within @xmath12515% ) . for the best - fit lf evolving in @xmath119 from @xcite",

    "such an increase would , however , result in a total of 2.2 predicted galaxies in the hff parallel blank field , which is marginally inconsistent with not finding any candidate with @xmath4 .",

    "no correction for dust extinction was applied , consistent with the expectation for very little dust in these galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "while we adopt the widely used approach for deriving the sfr , we note that the conversion of uv luminosity to sfr assumes both an initial mass function ( imf ) as well as a star - formation history .",
    "if galaxies are significantly younger than 100 myr or if their star - formation is very bursty ( as predicted by some models ; e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the standard conversion factor may need to be corrected ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the investigation of these alternatives goes beyond the scope of this paper , however .",
    "when integrating the uv lf down to @xmath133 , which corresponds to a sfr limit of 0.7 @xmath134 , we obtain a sfrd of @xmath135 m@xmath136yr@xmath16mpc@xmath128 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : sfrdevol ] , where we also plot the previous estimates for comparison .",
    "our approach to estimate the sfrd , which is an integrated quantity , is not sensitive to the exact magnification of the candidate source .",
    "i.e. even if the magnification at the exact source position presented in @xcite were underestimated and the galaxy intrinsically had a sfr of less than our limit of 0.7 @xmath134 , the sfrd value derived here is still valid . as long as the magnification map produces an accurate differential number count distribution ( which is marginalized over the image plane ) our approach of seeking the best - fitting normalization to the uv lf and integrating this to a fixed sfr limit produces accurate results .",
    "while the new constraint from the a2744 hff fields is somewhat higher than the previous ultra - deep field constraints , it is consistent with the rapid decline across @xmath1 to @xmath2 that is predicted by theoretical models . in particular",
    "fig [ fig : sfrdevol ] also shows the average sfrd evolution of a series of semi - analytical / empirical models @xcite and from sph simulations @xcite as well as the sfrd from the illustris simulation @xcite . where necessary , we shifted the theoretical models to account for our use of a salpeter imf when converting the uv luminosity to sfr .",
    "all theoretical models agree on a very rapid decline in the cosmic sfrd by @xmath137 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 when limited at @xmath138 @xmath134 , indicating that a rapid build - up of galaxies above this limit is a generic prediction of any model of galaxy formation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , given the still large errorbars , a more gradual decline in the sfrd as empirically estimated based on the uv lf evolution across @xmath139 ( see gray line in fig [ fig : sfrdevol ] ) can still not be completely ruled out . if the faint - end slope of the uv lf does not steepen further at higher redshift @xcite or if the escape fraction stays constant , this more gradual decline may be necessary for galaxies to complete reionization in agreement with the high optical depth measurement by wmap ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note , however , that the rapid decline in the observed sfrd may simply be a consequence of our fixed detection limit in luminosity and is likely still compatible with a more gradual evolution of the _ total _ sfrd .",
    "this is supported both by the higher sfrd estimates of gamma ray burst counts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are sensitive to the total sfrd , and by simulations ( e.g. , compare with * ? ? ?",
    "this paper presented a first estimate of the cosmic sfrd at @xmath2 based on frontier field data .",
    "in particular , we show that extensive completeness simulations including source blending and lensing shear close to the critical curve are crucial for any analysis of cluster data .",
    "we find a significantly lower completeness at higher magnification than for comparable blank field searches at a fixed observed magnitude ( figures [ fig : posdepcompleteness ] and [ fig : magdepcompleteness ] ) .",
    "this can be ascribed to several effects : blending with bright foreground cluster galaxies , higher background due to intra - cluster light , but also due to shear spreading out highly magnified sources over many pixels .",
    "sources at high magnification are on average only 70% complete in the a2744 image compared to a blank field even when the effect of shear is ignored ( due to blending with foreground sources and the icl ) .",
    "shear further reduces the completeness at @xmath102 by @xmath104 . however , the exact completeness at high magnification sensitively depends on the assumed size distribution for very faint sources below the detection limit of current blank field data ( see fig [ fig : magdepcompleteness ] ) .",
    "this effect therefore adds to the overall uncertainty of lf and sfrd estimates from cluster lensing fields .",
    "this position - dependent completeness has often been overlooked in the literature ( but see * ? ? ? * and recently ishigaki et al .",

    "however , it has important consequences on the expected number of high - redshift candidates seen behind lensing clusters compared to blank fields . in figure",
