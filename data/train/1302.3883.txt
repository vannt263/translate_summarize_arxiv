    "* ) . understanding the feedback loop between protostars and molecular clouds is challenging ; in part , because protostellar evolution is a stochastic process where violent accretion events may punctuate periods of more moderate accretion @xcite .",

    "chemical models indicate that gas - phase formation of co@xmath2 is highly inefficient at low temperature , and solid co@xmath0 is therefore widely assumed to be produced through chemical reactions on the surfaces of icy grain mantles @xcite . despite many experimental efforts to investigate the formation routes to solid co@xmath0 , the precise chemical pathway is still debated @xcite .",
    "the spectral profile of the co@xmath0 bending mode is a sensitive diagnostic of the local molecular environment . in observations toward cold , quiescent molecular clouds ,",
    "the profile is invariably characterized by a relatively broad , single - peaked , asymmetric absorption profile at 15.2 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the quiescent profile can generally be modeled as a linear combination of hydrogen - rich ( h@xmath2o : co@xmath2 ) and co - rich ( co : co@xmath2 ) ice mixtures , typically dominated by the hydrogen - rich component , at low temperatures ( _ t _ @xmath5 20 k ) .    at the other extreme , along lines - of - sight toward highly luminous ( _ l _ @xmath6 10@xmath7__l__@xmath8 ) , massive protostars , the bending mode often exhibits a double - peaked substructure near 15.15 and 15.27 @xmath1 @xcite . the double - peaked substructure is attributed to davydov splitting , a phenomenon observed in molecular crystals having more than one equivalent molecule per unit cell @xcite , and is characteristic of pure , crystalline co@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "@xcite found that all observed co@xmath2 bending mode profiles toward protostellar environments can be decomposed , phenomenologically , into five unique components . through the comparison with laboratory ice analogs ,",
