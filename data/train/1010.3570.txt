    "random states are often used in various problems in quantum mechanics and the theory of quantum information . on one hand , to describe properties of a quantum state affected by noise present in the system , one may assume that a given state is subjected to random interaction .",
    "on the other hand , random quantum states emerge in a natural way due to time evolution of arbitrary initial states of quantum analogues of classically chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , not knowing much about a given physical state one can ask about their generic properties , characteristic of a typical state .",
    "for instance , a key conjecture in the theory of quantum information concerning the additivity of minimal output entropy was recently shown to be false by investigating properties of random states obtained by random operations applied to the maximally entangled state of a composed system @xcite .",
    "a standard ensemble of random pure states of size @xmath0 is induced by the haar measure over the unitary group @xmath3 .",
    "the same construction works for quantum composite systems .",
    "for instance , random pure states of an @xmath4 quantum system corresponds to the natural fubini - study measure , invariant with respect to the unitary group @xmath5 .",
    "thus such ensembles of random pure states are structureless , as the probability measure is determined by the total dimension of the hilbert space and is does not depend on the tensor product structure @xcite .    in this work",
    "we are going to analyze _ structured ensembles _ of random states on a composite systems , in which such a tensor product structure plays a crucial role . for instance , in the case of an @xmath6 system , it is natural to consider ensembles of random states invariant with respect to local unitary transformations , described by the product unitary group , @xmath7 .",
    "well known constructions of random product states and random maximally entangled states can thus serve as simplest examples of the structured ensembles of random states .",
    "other examples of structured ensembles of random pure states , which correspond to certain graphs were recently studied in @xcite .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to introduce physically motivated ensembles of structured random states and to characterize the quantum entanglement of such states . for this purpose",
    "we analyze the spectral density @xmath8 of the reduced density matrix of size @xmath0 , where @xmath9 denotes the rescaled eigenvalue , @xmath10 . in some cases",
    "we evaluate also the average entanglement entropy , defined as the shannon entropy of the vector @xmath11 of the schmidt coefficients .",
    "we treat in detail two cases of a direct importance in the theory of quantum information .",
    "the first ensemble is obtained by taking a coherent superposition of a given number of @xmath1 independent , random maximally entangled states of an @xmath12 system .",
    "we derive explicit formulae for the asymptotic spectral density @xmath13 of the reduced state and show that in the limit of large @xmath1 , the density converges to the _ marchenko - pastur distribution _ ( mp ) @xcite .",
    "this feature is characteristic to the case of the structureless ensemble of random pure states , which induces probability measures in the set of mixed quantum states @xcite .    to introduce the second example of a structured ensemble we need to consider a four partite system .",
    "we start with an arbitrary product state and by allowing for a generic bi - partite interaction we create two random states on subsystems @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the key step is now to perform an orthogonal selective measurement in the maximally entangled basis on subsystems @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "even though the resulting pure state on the remaining subsystems @xmath18 and @xmath19 does depend on the outcome of the measurement , its statistical properties do not , and we show that the corresponding level density is given by the fuss - catalan distribution .    note that the above two constructions could be experimentally accessible , at least in the two - qubit case for @xmath20 .",
    "the second construction can be easily generalized for a system consisting of @xmath21 subsystems .",
    "an initially product state is then transformed by a sequence of bi - partite interactions into a product of @xmath22 bi - partite random states . performing an orthogonal projection into a product of @xmath23 maximally entangled bases we arrive with a random bipartite state of the structured ensemble defined in this way .",
    "the distribution of its schmidt coefficients is shown to be asymptotically described by the _ fuss - catalan distribution _ of order @xmath22 , since its moments are given by the generalized fuss - catalan numbers @xcite .",
    "this distribution can be considered as a generalization of the mp distribution which is obtained for @xmath24 .",
    "we conclude this paper proposing a generalized , two - parameter ensemble of structured random states , which contains , as particular cases , all the ensembles analyzed earlier in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we recall necessary definitions and describe a general scheme of generating mixed states by taking random pure states on a composite system of a given ensemble and taking an average over selected subsystems . in section",
    "iii we use @xmath25 independent random unitary operators to construct the arcsine ensemble obtained by superposition of two random maximally entangled states .",
    "more general structured ensembles are obtained by superposing @xmath1 random maximally entangled states .",
    "other ensembles of random pure states are discussed in section iv .",
    "for completeness we review here some older results on ensembles which lead to the hilbert - schmidt and the bures measures in the space of density matrices .    in section",
    "v we present a scheme to generate random states by considering a state defined on a @xmath21partite system and performing measurement onto the product of @xmath23 maximally entangled states .",
    "the distribution of the schmidt coefficients of the resulting random pure state is then given by the fuss - catalan distribution of order @xmath22 .",
    "an explicit form of this distribution is presented in sec .",
    "vi for any @xmath22 . in sec .",
    "vii we list various ensembles of random states , characterize their statistical properties and introduce a generalized ensemble of structured states ( [ genera ] , [ gensemble ] ) .",
    "details concerning the properties of the sum of @xmath1 independent random unitary matrices are presented in appendix a. brief discussion of real random pure states and real density matrices is provided in appendix b , in which we state that the distribution of singular values of a product of @xmath22 real random ginibre matrices can be asymptotically described by the fuss  catalan distribution .",
    "to construct an ensemble of random states of a given size @xmath0 one needs to specify a probability measure in the set of all density operators of this size .",
    "interestingly , there is no single , distinguished probability measure in this set , so various ensembles of random density operators are used .    a possible way to define such an ensemble is to take random pure states of a given ensemble on bi - partite system and to average over a chosen subsystem .",
    "the structureless ensemble of random pure states on @xmath26 system distributed according to unitarily invariant measure leads then to the hilbert - schmidt measure @xcite .",
    "a similar construction to generate random states according to the bures measure @xcite was recently proposed in @xcite .",
    "these algorithms to generate random quantum states are already implemented in a recent _ mathematica _ package devoted to quantum information @xcite .",

    "we are going to analyze ensembles of random states , for which the probability measure has a product form and may be factorized @xcite , @xmath35 so the distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors are independent .",
    "it is natural to assume that the eigenvectors are distributed according to the unique , unitarily invariant , haar measure @xmath36 on @xmath3 . taking this assumption as granted , the measure in the space of density matrices will be determined by the first factor @xmath37 describing the joint distribution of eigenvalues @xmath38 .    in quantum theory",
    "mixed states arise due to an interaction of the system investigated with an external environment .",
    "one may then make certain assumptions concerning the distribution of pure states describing the extended system .",
    "the desired mixed state @xmath32 on the principal system @xmath18 of size @xmath0 can be then obtained by partial trace over the subsystem @xmath16 of an arbitrary size @xmath39 .",
    "consider an arbitrary orthonormal product basis @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "any pure state @xmath43 of the bi  partite system ( not necessarily normalized ) can be expanded in this base , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a given complex rectangular matrix of size @xmath6 .",
    "let us then consider an arbitrary complex matrix @xmath45 .",
    "it leads to a ( weakly ) positive matrix @xmath46 .",
    "thus normalizing it one obtains a legitimate quantum state , which corresponds to the partial trace of the initial pure state @xmath43 over the subsystem @xmath16 , @xmath47 for instance , taking @xmath45 from the _ ginibre ensemble _",
    "@xcite of complex square matrices we get the hilbert ",
    "schmidt ensemble of quantum states , while a more general family of induced measures corresponds @xcite to the ensemble of rectangular ginibre matrices .",
    "the spectrum of a density matrix @xmath32 is thus equivalent to the set of schmidt coefficient of the initially pure state @xmath43 , which are equal to squared singular values of a matrix @xmath45 , normalized in such a way that tr@xmath48 .",
    "the degree of mixing of the reduced matrix @xmath32 can be characterized by its von neumann entropy , @xmath49 , equal to the shannon entropy of the schmidt vector , @xmath50 .",
    "this quantity is also called _ entropy of entanglement _ of the pure state @xmath43 , as it is equal to zero iff the state has a tensor product structure and is separable .",
    "we are also going to use the chebyshev entropy , which depends only on the largest eigenvalue @xmath51 , and determines the geometric measure of entanglement of the pure state @xmath43 .",
    "different assumptions concerning the distributions of pure states of the bi - partite system lead to different ensembles of mixed states on the system @xmath18 .",
    "a natural assumption that @xmath43 belongs to the standard , structureless ensemble of random pure state distributed with respect to the unitarily invariant measure leads to the induced measures @xcite in the space of mixed states .    in the subsequent section",
    "we are going to present simple examples of structured ensembles of random states , in which the tensor structure plays a key role .",
    "for instance , we discuss first ensembles of random states of a bi - partite systems , which are invariant with respect to local unitary operations .",

    "consider an arbitrary product state on a bi - partite system , @xmath52 .",
    "a local unitary operation , @xmath53 , can not produce quantum entanglement , so the state defined by two random unitary matrices , @xmath54 is also separable .",
