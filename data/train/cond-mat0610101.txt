    "<S> cu - nmr study has been performed on the disordered spin - gap system @xmath0 in the high - field @xmath1=@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the spin - gap , the hyperfine field becomes extremely inhomogeneous at low temperatures due to the field - induced magnetic order , indicating that the ordered spin state must be different from the pure tlcucl@xmath4 . in the low field @xmath5 , a saturating behavior in the longitudinal nuclear spin relaxation rate @xmath6 was observed at low temperatures , indicating existence of the magnetic ground state proposed to be bose - glass phase by fisher .    </S>",
    "<S> spin systems with a low dimensionality , a small spin number , and a small anisotropy often show a gapped ground state by forming singlet dimers . the magnetic field which exceeds @xmath7 induces triplons , which act as nearly free bosons , and </S>",
    "<S> are expected to undergo the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) at low temperatures  @xcite . tlcucl@xmath4 and kcucl@xmath4 are typical examples for the quantum spin magnet@xcite . the field - induced magnetic order in these systems has been observed experimentally ,  @xcite and interpreted theoretically as the bose - einstein condensation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin state in the bec phase is considered to be the superposition of singlet and triplet states .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this coherent hybridization brings about two effects to the spin system , the increase in the uniform magnetization , and the formation of the staggered magnetization directed perpendicular to the applied field . </S>",
    "<S> both the two are detected experimentally below the ordering temperature @xmath8 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the motivation of this study is rooted in the interest in what is caused by introducing a disorder to these quantum spin magnets . </S>",
    "<S> fisher _ et al . _ have investigated the phase diagram of disordered bose particle system theoretically to find the appearance of the new phase `` bose - glass '' at absolute zero .  @xcite they propose characteristics of the bose - glass phase as : it locates in @xmath9-@xmath10 phase diagram on the zero - temperature line at low field region , adjacent to the bec phase at high field region , 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the field - induced triplons are massless and localized , and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundary is modified from the clean system . </S>",
    "<S> one can introduce disorder to tlcucl@xmath4 very easily by substituting tl site with k. oosawa _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_. have reported  @xcite that the @xmath11-@xmath9 curve of ( tl , k)cucl@xmath4 has a finite gradient around zero field , and that bec takes place at high fields above @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> recent study of specific heat by shindo _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ has revealed that @xmath12 , the phase boundary of bec is appreciably modified by disorder as predicted by fisher .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite these results seem to be quite convincing for the existence of the bose - glass phase , but , the microscopic spin state of the phase is unknown . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this study is to investigate microscopically on these two points by cu - nmr .    </S>",
    "<S> the two single crystals of tl@xmath13k@xmath14cucl@xmath4 ( @xmath15=0.1 , 0.2 ) were synthesized by the bridgman method.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the critical fields in the field parallel to the @xmath16-axis of the two samples @xmath15=0.1 , 0.2 are @xmath7=4.4 and 3.9 t respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nmr spectra are obtained by plotting the spin - echo amplitude against either the applied field or the sample - rotating angle . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath6 was determined by the saturation - recovery method  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of field - swept spectra in the field region 6 - 12 t , where @xmath12 the transition temperature of bec@xcite is shown by arrows . at high temperatures , sharp paramagnetic nmr lines </S>",
    "<S> are observed , and explained in terms of eqq - perturbed nuclear states for @xmath17cu and @xmath18cu ( @xmath19=3/2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 the profile of rotating spectra measured under various magnetic fields with the peak positions calculated by the numerical diagonalization of nuclear spin hamiltonian . the two show a good agreement with nmr parameters of @xmath20=39.2mhz , @xmath210 , @xmath220(% ) , and the direction of the principal axis of the electric field gradient tensor perpendicular to the @xmath23 basal plane , which are the nearly same as those used to explain the singlet sites in iso - structural compounds kcucl@xmath4 and nh@xmath24cucl@xmath4 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for there are the two dimers connected with the glide symmetry in a unit cell , a peak number is doubled to be twelve , though one of the two satellite transitions is always invisible . the same case occurs in pure tlcucl@xmath4 but not in nh@xmath24cucl@xmath4 and kcucl@xmath4 . in higher field region above 7 t , the amplitude of signal in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 becomes extremely weak because the spin - spin relaxation time @xmath25 tends to be very short due to the increase in the number of triplons .    with lowering temperature , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the peak positions do not change , that is , within @xmath260.05% . in the experimental temperature range . when the temperature is still lowered to around 3k , a drastic change </S>",
    "<S> is observed in spectra . </S>",
    "<S> an extremely broad peak appears from the higher field side , and covers all the sharp peaks . at the lowest temperature 1.8k , the width of the broad peak exceeds 4 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> the field region of this broad tail moves to lower field as the temperature is decreased , but the leftmost of the region seems to be always higher than reported value of the bec transition @xmath12 by 3 - 4t@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors of the nmr spectra is quite different from the pure system where the clear splitting is observed in the bec state.@xcite transition from the paramagnetic peaks to the broad one at bec state takes place in a very narrow temperature range . for both the samples with @xmath270.1 and 0.2 , in focusing at the fixed field around 11 t , the change occurs within @xmath280.2 </S>",
    "<S> k , the sharpness of which is comparable with that of the pure system.@xcite    figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate @xmath6 under various fields higher ( a , b ) or lower ( c , d ) than @xmath7=@xmath29 . in the former case of ( a ) , @xmath6 first shows a significant decrease with decreasing temperature from the paramagnetic region , and then a diverging behavior at @xmath30 . in the panel ( b ) , the diverging behavior toward @xmath30 from the low temperature side is shown . </S>",
    "<S> the similar behavior is reported for pure tlcucl@xmath31@xcite . in low fields shown in ( c ) and ( d ) , where the ground state is expected to be bose - glass , @xmath6 decreases steeply until 4k , where it saturates and stays constant . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is completely different from what is expected in the gapped state . </S>",
    "<S> the saturated value of @xmath6 at lowest temperature depends on the mixing ratio @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample @xmath15=0.2 shows @xmath32(msec ) , which is ten times larger than that of @xmath15=0.1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the drastic broadening of spectra observed in bec state at low temperatures and high fields shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 indicates that the spin state in the bec of the disordered system is completely different from that in pure tlcucl@xmath4 . in the bec state of the pure system , </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the homogeneous staggered magnetization perpendicular to the applied field has been reported by neutron and nmr  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our result on the disordered system ( tl , k)cucl@xmath4 shows that the hyperfine field differs by site by site , and is extremely inhomogeneous , though its averaged value is similar to the pure system . </S>",
    "<S> the induced magnetization is of staggered - type , because the broad peak spreads over toward the both sides of the zero - shift position . in the vicinity of @xmath33 , </S>",
    "<S> the broad peak appears from the higher field side , because the bec transition temperature @xmath34 increases monotonically with increasing field.@xcite    the origin of the inhomogeneity in the hyperfine field is explained as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the bose - einstein condensation in tlcucl@xmath4 derives its name from the fact that the bloch state of @xmath35 condensates at the lowest energy state with @xmath36 , which is reported to be ( 0,0,1).@xcite the magnitude and the direction of the staggered moment are proportional to the hybridization amplitude and its phase . </S>",
    "<S> the broad spectra observed in the disordered system indicate that either the amplitude or the direction of the staggered magnetization must be distributed . in ( tl , k)cucl@xmath4 system , </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the spin - spin interaction is randomly modulated by the structural randomness due to the heteroatomic substitution . </S>",
    "<S> this modulation is expected to bring the inhomogeneity in the hybridization amplitude or its phase . </S>",
    "<S> when the direction of this staggered magnetization is not parallel with principal axes of either the hyperfine tensor or the quadrapole tensor , it causes a differentiation of the nmr shift in the two nuclei in the dimer , and hence the splitting or broadening in spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature independent shift in the paramagnetic state is explained in terms of the triplon localization in disordered systems@xcite . in ( tl , k)cucl@xmath4 system , induced triplon </S>",
    "<S> are localized in space by disorder , so that they contribute to macroscopic magnetization , but to the nmr shift of the singlet site . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is quite different from the case of the pure tlcucl@xmath4@xcite , where the induced triplons move around freely to produce the local magnetization uniform in the entire sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the critical slowing down at the vicinity of @xmath34 is consistent with the fact that bec is the second order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the saturating behavior of @xmath6 at low temperature in the low field region indicates that the ground state is gapless , which is consistent with the fisher s proposal on the bose - glass . </S>",
