    "burst spectra are nonthermal ; the photon number spectrum is a broken power law , with average slopes @xmath2 and @xmath3 at low and high energies and a shoulder at 100 kev - 1 mev  @xcite .    the data gathered by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the _ compton _ gamma - ray observatory confirmed earlier evidence of a rollover in the cumulative brightness distribution of grbs , showing that the burst sources are inhomogeneously distributed in space  @xcite .",
    "the data also showed that the sky distribution of even faint bursts is consistent with isotropy  @xcite ( see figure 3 ) .",

    "the evidence remained circumstantial .",
    "consequently , the grb distance scale  and even more , the nature of the burst sources  was debatable  @xcite .",
    "the principal reason for the continuing uncertainty in the distance scale of the bursts was that no definite counterpart to any burst could be found at other wavelengths , despite intense efforts spanning more than two decades .",
    "consequently , the study of grbs was isolated from the rest of astronomy .",
    "scientists studying them had only the laws of physics and the properties of the bursts themselves to guide them in attempting to solve the grb mystery .",

    "@xcite discovered a radio source coincident with the fading x - ray afterglow of this burst , marking the first detection of a radio afterglow .",
    "the radio afterglow showed rapid variability , which disappeared after about 30 days ( see figure 8) .",
    "the rapid variability has been interpreted as due to scintillation , implying that grb sources are highly compact and expand at relativistic speeds  @xcite .",
    "finally , we now know that grbs can produce astonishingly bright optical emission coincident with the burst itself .",
    "rotse , a robotic optical telescope , slewed to the position of grb 990123 , a burst whose position was determined by batse and disseminated by the gamma - ray burst coordinate network ( gcn ) , within @xmath5 seconds of the onset of the burst .",
    "the rotse observations revealed intense optical emission , peaking at @xmath6 during the burst and fading thereafter  @xcite ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "x - ray afterglows are now known for about two dozen grbs  @xcite .",
    "optical afterglows have been detected for roughly half of these bursts  @xcite , and radio afterglows have been detected for about one third of them  @xcite .",
    "host galaxies have been found for most of the bursts with detected optical and/or radio afterglows  @xcite .",
    "redshifts are known for eight grbs , three of these are from spectroscopic observations of the optical afterglow , and the remainder are from spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy ( see table 1 ) .",
    "not so long ago , adherents of the cosmological hypothesis for grbs favored a redshift range @xmath7 , which was derived primarily from the brightness distribution of the bursts under the assumption that grbs are standard candles ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "now astrophysicists routinely talk about redshift distances @xmath8 , a redshift range that is consistent with the modest number of grb redshifts that have been determined so far ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the increase in the grb distance scale implies that the grb phenomenon is much rarer than was previously thought .",
    "for example , schmidt  @xcite finds that the grb rate must be @xmath9 in order both to match the brightness distribution of the batse bursts and to accommodate the redshift distance of @xmath10 inferred for grb 971214 .    by comparison",

    ", the fraction is small : @xmath13 therefore , if such events are the sources of grbs , either the bursts are very strongly collimated ( @xmath14 ) or the physical conditions necessary to produce bursts are rarely satisfied in binary mergers and/or the core collapse of massive stars , implying that the grb phenomenon is not robust  @xcite .",

'' the extensive studies by loredo and wasserman  @xcite and the study by schmidt  @xcite show that the luminosity function for grbs could well be much broader .    even taking a luminosity range",
    "@xmath28 implies that @xmath29 , given the range in the distances of the grbs whose redshifts are currently known .",
    "this is far broader than the range of grb peak fluxes in the batse 4b catalog  @xcite , and implies that the flux distribution of the bursts extends well below the batse threshold .",
    "the breadth of the grb luminosity function and the narrow range in grb distances due to cosmology ( wasserman92,lamb99b ) suggests that a large part of the differences between apparently bright and apparently dim bursts ( such as time stretching of burst peaks  @xcite , decreased variability  @xcite , and spectral softening  @xcite ) are due to _ intrinsic _ differences between _ intrinsically _ bright and faint bursts , rather than to , e.g. , cosmological time dilation  @xcite .",
    "the most widely discussed models of the sources of grbs involve a black hole and an accretion disk , formed either through the core collapse of a massive star  @xcite or the coalescence of a neutron star  neutron star ( ns - ns ) or neutron star  black hole ( ns - bh ) binary  @xcite .",
    "the former are expected to occur near or in the star - forming regions of their host galaxies , while most of the latter are expected to occur outside of the galaxies in which they were born .",
    "the energies listed in table 1 are difficult to accommodate in ns - ns or ns - bh binary merger models without invoking strong collimation of the burst .",
    "core collapse ( so - called `` collapsar '' ) models can accommodate such energies more easily , although energies @xmath30 erg require collimation , even assuming a high efficiency for the conversion of gravitational binding energy into gamma - rays  @xcite .",
    "current models of the bursts themselves fall into three general categories : those that invoke a central engine , those that invoke internal shock waves in a relativistically expanding outflow , and those that invoke a relativistic external shock wave .",
    "dermer  @xcite argues that the external shock wave model explains many of the observed properties of the bursts .",
    "by contrast , fenimore  @xcite argues that several features of grbs , such as the large gaps seen in burst time histories , can not be explained by the external shock wave model , and that the bursts must therefore be due either to a central engine or to internal shocks in a relativistically expanding wind .",
    "either way , the intensity and spectral variations seen during the burst must originate at a central engine .",
    "this implies that the lifetime of the central engine must in many cases be @xmath31 s , which poses a severe difficulty for ns - ns or ns - bh binary merger models , if such models are invoked to explain the long , softer , smoother bursts .",
    "the most widely discussed model of grb afterglows is the fireball model , in which the energy released by the central engine leads to a relativistic shock wave that expands into the interstellar medium or into material lost earlier by the burst progenitor via its stellar wind  @xcite .",
    "as the ejected material encounters the ambient material , two shocks are produced : a short - lived reverse shock that travels through the ejected material and a long - lived forward shock that propagates into the swept - up ambient material . in the fireball model ,",
    "the afterglow emission at radio , optical and x - ray energies is produced by synchrotron emission .",
    "this requires ( 1 ) efficient transfer of energy from the shocked protons ( which contain most of the energy ) to the electrons ; ( 2 ) efficient acceleration of the electrons to high energies ; and ( 3 ) rapid growth of the magnetic field to values corresponding to energy densities @xmath32 of that of the protons .",
    "figure 10 shows the afterglow spectrum expected in the relativistic fireball model .",
    "the spectrum resembles a broken power - law with four segments , which are due to self - absorbed synchrotron emission at radio energies ( segment 1 ) ; optically thin synchrotron emission extending from sub - millimeter through the optical into the uv , with the synchrotron peak in the near ir or optical ( segments 2 and 3 ) ; and synchrotron emission above the synchrotron peak from electrons that have already cooled ( segment 4 ) .",
    "the four broken power - law segments are separated by three frequencies : @xmath33 , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ; @xmath34 , the frequency of the synchrotron peak , which corresponds to the minimum energy of the electrons ; and @xmath35 , which corresponds to the energy of the electrons that have begun to cool significantly .    the evolution of the frequencies @xmath33 and @xmath35 are distinctly different , depending on whether the relativistic fireball is expanding into a constant density ism , or into the decreasing density @xmath36 expected for material previously ejected by the stellar wind of the progenitor of the grb  @xcite ( see figure 10 ) .",
    "if the relativistic fireball model suffices to explain burst afterglows , much can be learned ( in principle ) , including the isotropic - equivalent energy of the fireball , the ratio of the energy in the magnetic field to that in relativistic electrons , and the density of the external medium into which the fireball expands ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this requires , however , enough simultaneous broad - band photometric or spectral observations to determine accurately the frequencies @xmath37 , and @xmath35 .",
    "it should also be possible , in principle , to use the effects of extinction due to dust and absorption above the lyman limit due to hydrogen in the host galaxy to determine the redshift of the burst itself , but so far , this goal has eluded modelers ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) .",
    "many powerful astrophysical sources produce jets , including young protostars ; so - called `` microquasars , '' which are black hole binaries in the galaxy ; radio galaxies ; and active galactic nuclei .",
    "there is also evidence from polarization observations that some supernovae are asymmetric  @xcite .",
    "most theorists therefore now expect grbs to be significantly collimated , and as discussed above , collimation reduces the energy required to power the bursts by the collimation factor @xmath38 . knowledge of the collimation of grbs is thus essential to inferring the energies of the bursts .    in the external shock model of grb afterglows ,",
    "the `` edge '' of the jet will become visible as the shock slows down and relativistic beaming decreases .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that , as the shock slows down , it will expand laterally , initially at near the speed of light  @xcite .",
    "the combination of these two effects produces a steepening of the afterglow light curve ( see figures 11 and 12 ) , although for the expected values of the parameters involved , the steepening is rather gradual  @xcite .",
    "however , steepening of the afterglow light curve can also occur as the external shock moves into denser circumstellar material  @xcite , confounding the interpretation of the observations .",
    "so far the observational evidence for beaming is inconclusive .",
    "for example , the lightcurve of the afterglow of grb 990123 shows a steepening after several days that has been interpreted as due to the spreading of a jet  @xcite , but the break is not achromatic , as would be expected if it were beamed . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical and radio afterglows of grb 990510 appear to provide stronger evidence that the burst is collimated  @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of large numbers of `` orphan afterglows ; '' i.e , x - ray , optical and radio transients unassociated with grbs  @xcite , argues that the collimation can not be extreme .",
    "+     +     +     +     +     +",
    "castander and lamb  @xcite showed that the light from the host galaxy of grb 970228 , the first burst for which an afterglow was detected , is very blue .",
    "this implies that the host galaxy is undergoing copious star formation and suggests an association between grb sources and star - forming galaxies .",
    "subsequent analyses of the color of this galaxy  @xcite ( see figure 13 ) and other host galaxies ( see , e.g ,  @xcite have strengthened this conclusion , as has the detection of [ oii ] and ly@xmath39 emission lines from several host galaxies  @xcite ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "+     +    the inferred size ( @xmath40 kpc ) and the morphology of grb host galaxies strongly suggest that they are primarily low - mass ( @xmath41 ) but not necessarily sub - luminous galaxies , because of the ongoing star formation in them ( most have @xmath42 , but some have @xmath43 ; here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mass and luminosity of a galaxy like the milky way ) .",
    "thus , it is sometimes not fully appreciated that , while the total star formation rate in grb host galaxies is often modest ( resulting in modest [ oii ] and ly@xmath39 emission line strengths ) , the star formation rate _ per unit mass _ in them is very large .",
    "figures 6 , 15 and 16 show hst wfpc2 and stis images of the optical afterglows and host galaxies of grbs 970228 , 970508 and 990123 .",
    "these images illustrate the fact that all of the grb afterglows so far detected are coincident with bright blue regions of the host galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the positional coincidence between burst afterglows and the bright blue regions of the host galaxies , and the evidence for extinction by dust of some burst afterglows ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite , suggests that the sources of these grbs lie near or in the star - forming regions themselves .",
    "the increasingly strong evidence that the bursts detected by bepposax originate in galaxies undergoing star formation , and may occur near or in the star - forming regions themselves , favors the collapsar model and disfavors the binary merger model as the explanation for long , softer , smoother bursts .",
    "simulations of the kicks given to ns - ns and ns - bh binaries by the sne that form them shows that most binary mergers are expected to occur well outside any galaxy  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly the case , given that the grb host galaxies identified so far have small masses , as discussed earlier , and therefore low escape velocities .",
    "the fact that all of the optical afterglows of the bepposax bursts are coincident with the disk of the host galaxy therefore also disfavors the binary merger model as the explanation for the long , softer , smoother bursts .",
    "however , this evidence is indirect .",
    "+     +    the discovery that the light curves and spectra of the afterglows of grb 980326  @xcite ( see figure 17 ) and grb 970228  @xcite ( see figures 18 and 19 ) appears to contain a sn component , in addition to a relativistic shock wave component , provides a more direct clue that the long , softer , smoother bursts detected by bepposax are the result of the collapse of massive stars . however , the weight of this evidence is limited by the sparseness of the existing data and the small number of studied afterglows .    these various discoveries",
    "favor the supernova model for the long , softer , smoother grbs that comprise 80% of grbs and all of the bursts detected by bepposax to date .",
    "however , it is important to remember that we currently have no clues whatsoever about the nature of the sources of the short , harder , more variable bursts .",
    "even their distance scale is unknown .",
    "happily , this situation is likely to change profoundly with the launch of hete-2 , which is capable of providing accurate , near - real time positions for both short and long bursts  @xcite .",
    "one thing is now clear : grbs are a powerful probe of the high-@xmath46 universe .",
    "lamb and reichart  @xcite have calculated the limiting redshifts detectable by batse and hete-2 , and by _ swift _ , for the seven grbs with known redshifts and published peak photon number fluxes ( see table 1 ) .",
    "they find that batse and hete-2 would be able to detect four of these bursts ( grbs 970228 , 970508 , 980613 , and 980703 ) out to redshifts @xmath47 , and three ( grbs 971214 , 990123 , and 990510 ) out to redshifts of @xmath48 ( see figure 20 ) .",
    "_ swift _ would be able to detect the former four out to redshifts of @xmath49 , and the latter three out to redshifts in excess of @xmath50 , although it is unlikely that grbs occur at such extreme redshifts .",
    "consequently , if grbs occur at very high redshifts ( vhrs ) , batse has probably already detected them , and future missions should detect them as well .",
    "+     +    lamb and reichart  @xcite also show , somewhat surprisingly , that the soft x - ray , optical and infrared afterglows of grbs are detectable out to vhrs .",
    "the reason is that , while the increase in distance and the redshifting of the spectrum tend to reduce the spectral flux in grb afterglows in a given frequency band , cosmological time dilation tends to increase it at a fixed time of observation after the grb , since afterglow intensities tend to decrease with time .",
    "these effects combine to produce little or no decrease in the spectral energy flux @xmath51 of grb afterglows at redshifts larger than @xmath52 .",
    "this result can be understood as follows .",
    "the spectral flux @xmath51 of grb afterglows in a given frequency band and at a fixed time of observation after the grb is given as a function of redshift by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the intrinsic spectral luminosity of the grb afterglow , which we assume applies even at early times , and @xmath55 is the comoving distance to the burst .",
    "many afterglows fade like @xmath56 , which implies that @xmath57 in the simplest afterglow model where @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath55 increases very slowly with redshift beyond a redshift @xmath52 . consequently , there is little or no decrease in the spectral flux of grb afterglows with increasing redshift beyond @xmath52 .",
    "for example ,  @xcite find in the case of grb 980519 that @xmath59 and @xmath60 so that @xmath61 , which implies no decrease in the spectral flux with increasing redshift , except for the effect of @xmath55 . in the simplest afterglow model where @xmath62 , if the afterglow declines more rapidly than @xmath63 , the spectral flux actually _ increases _ as one moves the burst to higher redshifts !    as second example , the left panel of figure 21 shows the k - band light curves of the early afterglow of grb 970228  @xcite , as observed one day after the burst , transformed to various redshifts .",
    "the transformation involves ( 1 ) dimming the afterglow , ( 2 ) redshifting its spectrum , ( 3 ) time dilating its light curve , and ( 4 ) extinguishing the spectrum using a model of the ly@xmath64 forest .",
    "the left panel of figure 21 shows that in this case also , the three effects nearly cancel one another out at redshifts greater than a few",
    ". thus the afterglow of a grb occurring at a redshift slightly in excess of @xmath65 would be detectable at k @xmath66 mag one hour after the burst , and at k @xmath67 mag one day after the burst , if its afterglow were similar to that of grb 970228 ( a relatively faint afterglow ) .",
    "the right panel of figure 21 shows the resulting spectral flux distribution .",
    "the spectral flux distribution of the afterglow is cut off by the ly@xmath64 forest at progressively lower frequencies as one moves out in redshift .",
    "thus the redshift distance of high - redshift ( @xmath68 ) grbs can readily be determined from the wavelength of the optical `` dropout '' in their afterglow spectrum and of very high redshift ( @xmath69 ) grbs from the wavelength of the infrared `` dropout , '' in their afterglow spectrum  @xcite .",
    "figure 22 shows the visibility of any sn remnant , as a function of redshift .",

    "the numerical simulations indicate that the sfr increases with increasing redshift until @xmath78 , at which point it levels off .",

    "if these grbs are due to the collapse of massive stars , they may be a powerful probe of the very high redshift universe .",
    "david schramm was a wonderfully enthusiastic and supportive colleague .",
    "his scientific interests ranged over much of astrophysics , including the mysterious phenomenon of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "i am sure that he would have been excited about recent observational evidence that appears to link grbs and one of his favorite subjects , supernovae ; and delighted that grbs may be a powerful probe of the early universe , a topic to which he contributed so much .",
