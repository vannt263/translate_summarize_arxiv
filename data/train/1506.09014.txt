    "in this paper , we study the inverse boundary value problem for the wave equation using the single - layer potential operator as the data .",
    "we assume that the data have frequency content in a bounded interval .",
    "the mentioned inverse boundary value problem arises , for example , in reflection seismology @xcite .",
    "we show how to choose classes of nonsmooth coefficient functions so that optimization formulations of inverse wave problems satisfy the prerequisites for application of steepest descent and newton - type iterative methods .",
    "indeed , we establish the existence of a misfit functional derived from the hilbert - schmidt norm and its gradient . the proof is based on resolvent estimates for the corresponding helmholtz equation , exploiting the fact that the frequencies are contained in a bounded interval .    via conditional lipschitz stability estimates for the time - harmonic inverse boundary value problem , which we established in earlier work @xcite",
    ", we can then guarantee convergence of the iteration if it is initiated within a certain distance of the ( unique ) solution of the inverse boundary value problem .",
    "indeed , such a convergence of a nonlinear projected steepest descent iteration was obtained in @xcite .    in our scheme",
    "we can allow approximate localization of the data in selected time windows , with size inversely proportional to the maximum allowed frequency .",
    "this is of importance to applications in the context of reducing the complexity of field data and thus of the underlying coefficient functions .",
    "note that no information is lost by cutting out a short time window , since our source functions ( and solutions ) , being compactly supported in frequency , are analytic with respect to time .",
    "uniqueness of the mentioned inverse boundary value problem for the helmholtz equation , that is , using single - frequency data , was established by sylvester and uhlmann @xcite assuming that the wavespeed is a bounded measurable function .",
    "this inverse problem has also been extensively studied from an optimization point of view .",
    "we mention , in particular , the work of @xcite .",
    "this paper can be viewed as a counterpart of the work by blazek , stolk & symes @xcite in the sense that we consider bounded frequency data .",
    "that is , we can not allow arbitrarily high frequencies in the data . without this restriction they observed that the adjoint equation did not admit solutions : this problem does not appear in our formulation through the use of resolvent estimates .",
    "the multi - frequency data are obtained from solutions to the corresponding boundary value problem for the wave equation by applying a fourier transform ( see @xcite for regularity of hyperbolic equations in such settings ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded smooth domain in @xmath1 and @xmath2 be a strictly positive bounded measurable function , constant outside of @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the inhomogeneous problem for the wave equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is compactly supported in frequency , and @xmath5 is the surface measure on @xmath6 inherited from @xmath7 .",
    "multi - frequency data have been exploited in so - called frequency progression in iterative schemes for the purpose of regularization @xcite .",
    "frequency progression can be realized in our approach by gradually enlarging the frequency interval of the data ; see also @xcite .",
    "iterative methods for the inverse boundary value problem for the wave equation , in reflection seismology , have been collectively referred to as full waveform inversion ( fwi ) .",
    "( the term ` full waveform inversion ' was presumably introduced by pan , phinney and odom in @xcite with reference to the use of full seismograms information . )",
    "lailly @xcite and tarantola @xcite introduced the formulation of the seismic inverse problem as a local optimization problem with a least - squares ( @xmath8 ) minimization of a misfit functional .",
    "we also mention the original work of bamberger , chavent & lailly @xcite in the one - dimensional case .",
    "since then , a range of alternative misfit functionals have been considered ; we mention , here , the criterion derived from the instantaneous phase used by bozdag , trampert and tromp @xcite .",
    "the time - harmonic formulation was initially promoted by pratt and collaborators in @xcite .",
    "later the use of complex frequencies was studied in @xcite . in fwi one",
    "commonly applies a `` nonlinear '' conjugate gradient method , a gauss - newton method , or a quasi - newton method ( l - bfgs ; for a review , see brossier @xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of the single - layer potential operator is motivated by what seismologists refer to as the process of source `` blending '' .",
    "this becomes clear upon introducing a hilbert - schmidt norm for this operator , which we justify in the development of a misfit criterion : basis functions of the underlying hilbert space are viewed as blended sources .",
    "the use of `` simultaneous '' sources in linearized inverse scattering was studied by dai and schuster @xcite , and in full waveform inversion , for example , by vigh and starr @xcite ( synthesizing source plane waves ) , krebs _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( random source encoding ) and gao , atle and williamson @xcite ( deterministic source encoding ) .",
    "berkhout , blacquire and verschuur @xcite considered simple time delays for the blending process , allowing the use of conventional sources in acquisition . the process of source blending has appeared in various acquisition ( and imaging ) strategies .",
    "perhaps the most basic form involves synthesizing source plane waves from point source data in plane - wave migration @xcite .",
    "so - called controlled illumination @xcite can also be viewed as a particular blending strategy . in blended acquisition ,",
    "typically , time - overlapping point source experiments , are generated in the field by using incoherent source arrays ; for simultaneous source firing , see beasley , chambers and jiang @xcite and for near simultaneous source firing , see stefani , hampson and herkenhoff @xcite .",
    "the use of simultaneous random sources have been proposed , further , by @xcite and others .",
    "it is well known that the logarithmic character of stability of the inverse boundary value problem for the helmholtz equation @xcite can not be avoided .",
    "in fact , in @xcite mandache proved that despite of regularity or a - priori assumptions of any order on the unknown wavespeed , logarithmic stability is optimal .",
    "however , conditional lipschitz stability estimates can be obtained : for example , accounting for discontinuities , such an estimate holds if the unknown wavespeed is a finite linear combination of piecewise constant functions with an underlying known domain partitioning @xcite .",
    "it was obtained following an approach introduced by alessandrini and vessella @xcite and further developed by beretta and francini @xcite for electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) .",
    "the relationship between the single - layer potential operator and the dirichlet - to - neumann map can be found in nachman @xcite .",
    "using this relationship , it follows that conditional lipschitz stability using the dirichlet - to - neumann map as the data implies conditional lipschitz stability using the single - layer potential operator as the data .",
    "note that this stability result is the only place in our proof that we need the dirichlet - to - neumann map .",
    "we control the forward operator via resolvent estimates for the helmholtz equation . in our low - regularity",
    "setting it is well known that the resolvent norm may go to infinity exponentially in frequency as energy goes to infinity : a famous example is the square well potential which goes back to gamow ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.25 ) ) .",
    "it is known in very general smooth settings that this growth is the worst that may occur : see results of burq @xcite , cardoso and vodev @xcite , and rodnianski and tao @xcite . in @xcite this is proved in a lower regularity setting , and in  [ s : res ] below we give a generalization of this result to certain piecewise constant wavespeeds .",
    "we also give an improved estimate by cutting off away from a sufficiently large compact set : this kind of improvement has been observed before in @xcite .",
    "and the example on the right has @xmath9 .",
    "part ( 1 ) of the theorem ( which says that the iteration converges exponentially fast ) applies to both examples , but part ( 2 ) ( which gives bounds for large frequencies ) applies only to the example on the right.,width=491 ]    let @xmath0 be a bounded domain in @xmath7 with smooth boundary , and let @xmath10 be a finite collection pairwise disjoint open subsets of @xmath0 with lipschitz boundaries , satisfying @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "given positive real numbers @xmath13 , define a wavespeed @xmath14 given by @xmath15 on @xmath16 and @xmath17 otherwise , and consider the following forward solution to : @xmath18 where @xmath19 vanishes for @xmath20 $ ] ( see ) . throughout the paper we take @xmath21 .    letting @xmath22 denote restriction to the boundary @xmath6",
    ", we take as our data knowledge of the operator @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a tensor product of @xmath8 functions on a time window with a hilbert space of hilbert  schmidt operators .",
    "more specifically @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the free wave evolution ( when @xmath28 ) , @xmath29 is any orthonormal basis of the space of sources @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is any interval of length @xmath32 ( see  [ s : land ] ) .",
    "let @xmath33 be the `` true wavespeed '' which we wish to recover , and define landweber iterates by @xmath34 for some @xmath35 and @xmath36 sufficiently small , where @xmath37 is the gradient of @xmath38 at @xmath39 ( see ) .",
    "locally , the landweber iteration converges exponentially fast . more specifically :    1 .   if @xmath40 and @xmath41 are sufficiently small , then there is @xmath42 such that @xmath43 .",
    "if the boundaries of the subdomains @xmath16 respect polar coordinates , in the sense that the radial derivative of any wavespeed under consideration is supported on a union of spheres , then @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath42 , all grow at most exponentially in @xmath46 .    here",
    "@xmath47 can be viewed as the `` simultaneous '' sources in `` blended '' data acquisition ; we should perhaps emphasize that there is no need to extract the single - layer potential operator , that is to say no need for `` deblending '' .      in  [",

    "we build in a time localization , and control the forward operator in a hilbert ",
    "schmidt sense .",
    "we compute the misfit functional and gradient in terms of the corresponding weighted @xmath8 inner product in time and a hilbert  schmidt inner product in space . in  [ s : conv ] we apply the results of the previous sections to prove the theorem .",

    "in this section we review the relationship between the dirichlet - to - neumann map and the single - layer potential operator . in this paper",
    "we are principally concerned with the latter , and use the former only for stability estimates .",
    "it is only because we use the dirichlet - to - neumann map at all that , at a few places in our proof , we must assume we are away from the dirichlet spectrum of certain operators on @xmath0 .",
    "we expect stability estimates to hold for the single - layer potential operator itself without reference to the dirichlet - to - neumann map , and with such estimates in hand one would be able to remove all reference to dirichlet spectra from the proof .    here , we consider time - harmonic waves , described by solutions , @xmath48 say , of the helmholtz equation on a bounded open domain @xmath49 .",
    "we write @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a coordinate on @xmath52 ( we will use the notation @xmath53 without tilde for an element of a hilbert space later in  [ s : land ] ) , and keep @xmath54 fixed ; we assume that @xmath55 and that @xmath14 is bounded below by a positive constant .",
