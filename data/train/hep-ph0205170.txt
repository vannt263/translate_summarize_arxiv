    "the existence of additional fermions , and their possible mixing with the known quarks and leptons of the standard model ( sm ) , has been widely studied in the literature .",
    "these additional fermions could behave like the sm ones , as in the case of a fourth family ( some times also called sequential fermions ) , or have exotic properties ( like vectorlike or mirror fermions ) .",
    "in particular , mirror fermions are very interesting objects from a phenomenological point of view , and their low - energy effects have been studied too  @xcite , including a discussion of limits on their masses  @xcite .",
    "more recently , models involving mirror fermions generations , i.e. , fermions with `` mirror '' isospin charges , have been discussed within a left - right ( lr ) symmetric context  @xcite .",
    "these models offer a possible solution to the strong cp problem , and have also been discussed in the context of strongly - interacting electroweak symmetry breaking scheemes  @xcite .",
    "applications to the search for new astrophysical phenomena have been pursued too  @xcite .",
    "in addition to direct production , these new fermions can manifest themselves through their mixing with the standard fermions , which can affect several aspects of flavor physics .",
    "for instance , new sources of flavor changing neutral process are usually presented in these extensions of the sm , which could lead to observable signatures and to seriously constrain such models .",
    "most applications have focused on the light fermions , and only recently the possible implications for the top quark have been studied  @xcite .",
    "given the fact that coming stages of tevatron ( run - ii ) will produce about @xmath3 top pairs , it is interesting to study rare decays of the top as possible tests of the sm  @xcite . furthermore , since higgs bosons could also be produced at significant rates at tevatron , it is also important to search for all the relevant higgs signatures that could be detected at run-2 ; future colliders ( lhc , vlhc , linear colliders ) will have the chance to extend further the search range .",
    "possible rare flavor violating higgs decay modes have been overlooked thus far , and only recently their phenomenological relevance has been discussed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze lepton - flavor - violating ( lfv ) signals in the context of lr models with mirror fermions ; we focus on the mixing phenomena that arises from the interactions between the standard and exotic fermions , and their implications for the scalar higgs sector . after discussing general conditions for the appearance of mixing in the extended fermion sector ( sec .",

    "we shall prove that these sources are described by independent parameters , and in order to search for the optimal rates for the signals of our interest , we shall assume that the bounds are saturated by the scalar exchange , which could simple mean that the mass of the additional gauge boson are much heavier than the sm - like higgs boson of the model .    in sec .",
