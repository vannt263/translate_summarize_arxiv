    "quantum bits , or qubits  @xcite , have been realized using , for example , superconducting circuits  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , single dopants in silicon  @xcite , and nitrogen vacancy centres  @xcite .",
    "the state of a qubit is affected by various sources of error such as finite qubit lifetime , measurement imperfections , non - ideal initialization , and imprecise external control .",
    "provided that these errors are below a certain threshold , they can be corrected with quantum error correction codes  @xcite which encode the information of a logical qubit into an ensemble of physical qubits .",
    "surface codes  @xcite , error correction codes with the highest known thresholds , may require thousands of physical qubits for each fault - tolerant logical qubit .",
    "controlling such a large ensemble of qubits consumes a great amount of power , rendering heat management at the qubit register an important challenge .",
    "the power consumption of a quantum processor can be decreased by implementing more accurate physical qubits , thus leading to smaller ensembles forming the logical qubits .",
    "however , it is known that gate errors also arise from the quantum - mechanical uncertainties in the control pulse  @xcite . in the case of a resonant disposable control pulse ,",
    "this type of error is inversely proportional to the pulse energy , and hence poses a trade - off in the power management of the quantum computer . even in the absence of all other types of error",
    ", this result implies such a high level of dissipated power at the chip temperature that it challenges the commercially available cryogenic equipment , as we estimate in appendix  [ appa ] for a typical superconducting quantum computer running a surface code to factorize a 2000-bit integer .    in this work ,",
    "we derive the greatest lower bound for the gate error within the resonant jaynes  cummings model  @xcite .",
    "the inevitable error originates from the quantum nature of the driving mode and becomes dominant in the regime of low driving powers .",
    "in contrast to previous work  @xcite , our constructive derivation does not need to assume any particular state of the system and is applicable to qubit rotations of arbitrary angles .",
    "in addition to the lower bound itself , our method naturally finds the bosonic quantum states of the pulse that reach the bound .",
    "we explicitly show that single - qubit rotations are optimally realized by applying a certain amount of squeezing to coherent states .",
    "the optimal states do not alone solve the above - mentioned heat dissipation problem , but we additionally find that back - action - induced correlations between the control pulse and the controlled qubit can be transferred to auxiliary qubits ( see also refs .",
    "thus we propose a control protocol where multiple gates are generated with a single control pulse which is frequently refreshed using auxiliary qubits .",
    "whereas previous studies suggest that it is not possible to save energy by reusing control pulses without sacrificing the minimum gate fidelity  @xcite , our method exhibits orders of magnitude smaller energy consumption with no drop in the average gate fidelity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiclassical ] , we briefly summarize the formalism used to describe qubit rotations and discuss gate errors in the semiclassical model . in sec .",

    "let us first review the semiclassical formalism of single - qubit control and the resulting gate errors .",
    "the state of a qubit can be represented as a bloch vector constrained inside a unit sphere , see fig .",
    "single - qubit logic gates @xmath0 , realized using , e.g. , microwave pulses , rotate the bloch vector by @xmath1 about the axis @xmath2 . assuming that the control pulse is a classical waveform in resonance with the qubit transition energy @xmath3",
    ", the system may be described in the rotating frame using a semiclassical interaction hamiltonian of the form  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the ground and excited states of the qubit , respectively , @xmath7 represents the classical amplitude @xmath8 and phase @xmath9 of the control field , @xmath10 is the coupling constant including the pulse envelope , and @xmath11 is the reduced planck constant .",
    "the gate @xmath0 is implemented by choosing the interaction time @xmath12 and the pulse envelope such that they satisfy @xmath13 . for example , setting @xmath14 and @xmath2 along the @xmath15-axis , the temporal evolution operator @xmath16 $ ] becomes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the pauli @xmath19-operator .",
    "thus , up to a redundant global phase factor , the interaction implements a perfect not gate @xmath20 .     model system .",
    "( a ) ideal two - level system ( bottom ) interacting with a harmonic oscillator ( top ) .",
    "( b ) bloch vector representation of the qubit state @xmath21 and an example @xmath20 rotation . ]",
    "we assess gate errors by utilizing the state transformation error @xmath22 where the initial qubit state is given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the desired gate . in general , the qubit state is unknown during the computation , and therefore we choose not to restrict our analysis to any specific state .",
    "instead , we study the average of a given error measure @xmath25 over a uniform state distribution on the bloch sphere , generally given by @xmath26    semiclassically , a source of gate error arises from uncertainties in the phase and the photon number @xmath27 , which are , for small phase fluctuations , fundamentally bounded by quantum mechanics through the minimal uncertainty relation  @xcite @xmath28 .",
    "thus we consider a control pulse with an average of @xmath29 photons and minimal uncertainties @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a free squeezing parameter .",
    "these uncertainties carry on to the temporal evolution operator @xmath33 , and we find from eq .   that the average gate error becomes inversely proportional to the photon number . for the @xmath20 gate for example",
    ", we obtain the average gate error @xmath34 in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "interestingly , the error is minimized with a non - zero squeezing parameter @xmath36 , a result also obtained in the full quantum treatment in sec .",
    "[ minimizationmethod ] .",
    "an alternative qubit - independent error quantity is the maximum gate error given by @xmath37 , which obeys a similar @xmath38-dependence  @xcite .",
    "let us proceed to the full quantum treatment , where the gate operation arises from the quantum - mechanical interaction between the qubit and a single bosonic mode referred to as the drive .",
    "utilization of such quantum drive  @xcite allows us to account for the changes in its state arising from the interaction with the qubit . in practice ,",
    "qubits are also driven by propagating photons described by a continuum of modes , but such arrangements do not save energy in comparison to a well - controlled single mode .",
    "hence our description below is expected to yield a fundamental lower bound for the energy needed for controlling a single qubit at a given fidelity .",
    "in contrast to the semiclassical model , the evolution of the qubit is not unitary .",

    "assuming resonant interaction , the system is governed by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the bosonic annihilation operator of the drive mode . without loss of generality , we assume an on - off envelope such that @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 otherwise .",

    "the circulating drive pulse ( red ) induces a chosen rotation @xmath91 on one of the qubits @xmath92 in the register and is then refreshed by sequential @xmath20 interactions with each ancillary qubit \\{@xmath93}. in an ideal setting , each ancilla is prepared precisely into the state @xmath94 and reset after each cycle . in practice , the ancilla qubits are initially in their ground states and their preparation and reset is implemented by a circulating corrector pulse ( green ) . ]    all of the fundamental lower bounds derived above are inversely proportional to the average photon number .",
    "intuitively , a drive with a large photon number should be capable of inducing multiple gates without changing substantially , thus decreasing the required amount of energy per gate for nearly equal error level .",
    "we show below that reusing a drive effectively decreases the energy consumption well below the lower bound of average gate error for disposable pulses .",
    "furthermore , the drive can be corrected between successive gates such that the consumption drops without essential decrease of the average gate fidelity .    in our protocol",
    ", an itinerant control drive cyclically interacts with a register of resonant qubits and ancillary qubits , see fig .",
    "a cycle begins with the drive , initially in a suitable squeezed coherent state , applying a chosen gate operation with minimal error on a register qubit .",
    "consequently , the drive state changes due to the quantum back - action . to undo this ,",
    "the drive is set to sequentially interact with corrective ancilla qubits , initialized in a superposition of ground and excited states , for a time corresponding to a @xmath84-rotation . as a result ,",
    "the purity , energy , and phase of the drive are restored in successive interactions ( see appendix  [ appd ] ) . at the end of the cycle ,",
    "the ancilla qubits are reset and the refreshed drive is usable for another high - fidelity gate .    with increasing number of ancilla qubits , the execution time of a full cycle increases and",
    "thus one itinerant pulse applies a gate on the register less frequently . to compensate for this , one could add another drive pulse for each ancilla in the array , and synchronize their travel times such that each qubit would interact with one of the pulses at a given time .",
    "such a system would apply as many gates on the register per cycle as there are itinerant pulses in circulation .",
    "however , we restrict our analysis to a single pulse .     evolution of an ancilla state during a refreshing cycle : ( i ) preparation from the ground state into the state @xmath95 , ( ii ) drive refresh as a result the primary rotation ( red ) , and ( iii ) ancilla reset .",
    "we either assume that the preparative steps ( i ) and ( iii ) are ideal or induced by a corrector pulse as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ]    the refreshing by the ancillary interactions is understood by considering the path traversed by the bloch vector of the ancillary qubit , as illustrated in fig .",
    "a drive lacking energy rotates the vector with smaller angular frequency , leaving the ancilla slightly biased towards the ground state and gaining energy in the process .",
    "similarly , excessive energy in the drive is transferred to the ancilla due to rotating it closer to the excited state .",
    "the hilbert space of this system is formally a composite space of the fock space @xmath96 of the drive and the two - level spaces @xmath97 of the register and ancilla qubits , @xmath98 the drive only interacts with one qubit at a time and therefore each interaction can be calculated in the subspace of the relevant qubit and the drive , assuming the qubits are not correlated .",
    "after the interaction , the drive state is extracted by tracing over the associated qubit space .",

    "we numerically simulate the evolution of the drive and evaluate the average error of the gate @xmath20 for a register qubit after each cycle . during the protocol , the average error @xmath60 will increase from its initial lower - bound value at varying rates depending on the randomized states of the register qubits .",
    "we find that after many cycles , the drive reaches a steady state that generates the desired gates with a predictable average error .",
    "with 13 ancillas per cycle , the average error saturates after a hundred cycles ; with ten or more ancillas , the saturation takes less than ten cycles .",
    "if no corrective ancillas are used , the average error eventually reaches @xmath108 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows how the eventual error level depends on the number of photons and ancillas .",
    "the average gate error approaches its theoretical lower bound , in the limit of many drive - refreshing ancilla qubits . for smaller rotation angles ,",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained with more slowly accumulating error .",
    "thus a single itinerant drive pulse supplied with ideal ancilla states can generate an infinite number of high - fidelity gates .      in the previous section , the qubits in the register were assumed to be essentially uncorrelated to justify the partial tracing over each qubit after the respective interaction .",
    "here we demonstrate the beneficial performance of our method in the case where the register qubits are maximally entangled . we initialize the register of @xmath109 qubits in the greenberger  horne ",
    "zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath110 .",
    "the control protocol is physically the same as in the previous section : the drive interacts with only one qubit at a time to implement a single - qubit gate @xmath24 and is refreshed by @xmath106 ideally prepared ancillas between each such gate .",

    "the circles represent the data , whereas the coloured lines extend the line segments between the first two data points , to distinguish deviations from linear behaviour .",

    "results of a simulation for an @xmath119 gate with the initial drive state @xmath123 are shown in fig .",
    "a behaviour similar to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is observed : with enough ancillary corrections between the register gates , the error produced by an itinerant drive can be reduced to the level given by individual pulses .",
    "the figure also suggests that even without corrections , reusing a drive of certain energy is more beneficial in practice than dividing the same amount of photons into individual , weaker disposable pulses .",
    "thus we conclude that regardless of the state of the register , refreshment of a drive pulse likely serves to improve the trade - off between gate error and required energy .",
    "the above case of entangled qubits also provides a way to compare our results to the previous work by gea - banacloche and ozawa  @xcite , where they studied a register in a ghz state that was operated by a drive of @xmath75 photons on average .",
    "they showed that the maximum error of the @xmath119 gate in this system scales as @xmath124 per qubit .",
    "this scaling was used to argue that a pulse of average photon number @xmath125 can not outperform @xmath109 individual pulses of @xmath126 average photons , although their performance was not compared explicitly .",
    "the key differences here are that ref .",
    "@xcite does not consider the possibility of using ancillary qubits , and that it employs a definition of error which also accounts for the infidelity of the drive state .",
    "our results suggest that even though the errors due to both reused and disposable pulses of equal total energy increase almost linearly with @xmath109 , the prefactor of the former is much smaller and can be greatly improved by the refreshing protocol .",

    "this is justified if the ancilla qubits do not become strongly correlated during the evolution .",
    "this approximation is more accurate the closer the control pulses are to classical pulses which do not induce entanglement .",
