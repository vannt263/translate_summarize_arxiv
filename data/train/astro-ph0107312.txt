    "@xcite presented um673 ( @xmath2 ) as a `` new case of gravitational lensing '' .",
    "the two lensed images originate from a quasar at a redshift @xmath3 , while the lensing galaxy is much closer to the milky way ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the angular separation between component @xmath5 and @xmath6 was found to be @xmath7 , while the magnitude of the qso images and the lens galaxy , at the time of discovery , was @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 magnitude , resulting in a total magnitude @xmath11 , with a standard deviation of the order of 0.2 magnitude .",
    "they concluded that um673 appeared to be one of the most luminous quasars , due to the amplification of image @xmath5 by gravitational lensing .",
    "a spectroscopic study of this gravitational lens was published by @xcite , in order to investigate the size of the corresponding @xmath12 clouds . since they found that the equivalent widths of the @xmath12 lines in the spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are well correlated",
    ", they concluded that both light beams actually cross the same clouds .",
    "data from this paper were used by @xcite to test their model for the minihalo of the @xmath12 forest for the case of um673 .",
    "@xcite observed um673 from 1987 to 1993 .",
    "the observations were performed in the @xmath6-band , to eliminate any possible contamination originating from the deflecting galaxy .",
    "they mainly derived the magnitude difference of the two qso components , because the observing conditions were of modest quality for most of the nights .",
    "the photometric zero point was computed for the nights of 1988 october 31 , 1988 december 17 and 1991 october 27 .",
    "the respective joint @xmath6 magnitude of the two qso components ( no contribution from the galaxy in the @xmath6-band ) was 168 , 169 and 167 .",
    "their results led to the conclusion that the quasar was not showing any significant variability , but the accuracy of the relative photometry was of the order of 0.05 to 0.2 magnitude .",
    "the mean @xmath6-band magnitude difference was @xmath13 .",
    "in a later report based on an eso key - program for photometric monitoring of gravitational lenses , @xcite confirmed the above conclusions .    during a 2-days workshop held in hambourg , @xcite presented some _ preliminary _ results from the 1988 - 1994 monitoring of the lens .",
    "the relative photometry of component @xmath5 , with respect to a reference magnitude @xmath14 , was indicating variations of the order of 0.2 magnitude ! unfortunately , nothing more was ever published , and therefore no additional information concerning the reduction method used or the reference magnitude could be found .    in a recently published paper concerning @xmath15 observations of gravitational lenses ,",
    "@xcite reported on observations of um673 performed in november 1994 .",
    "the @xmath0 magnitude of the components @xmath5 ,  @xmath6 , and the galaxy was @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , resulting in an integrated magnitude of @xmath18 .",
    "the error on the total magnitude is of the order of @xmath19 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( @xmath20 ) also observed um673 . having their own photometric system under preparation @xcite",
    ", they presented their measurements in a preliminary red filter , designated as @xmath21 ( see section  [ comparison with the literature ] ) .",
    "observations in the @xmath21 filter were performed in 1995 november 24 and 1996 december 12 .",
    "for the first period , @xcite reported @xmath22 , while for the second period @xcite reported @xmath23 .",
    "we report in this paper about a photometric monitoring through the years 1995 - 2000 , with conclusions to significant variations in the total light of the gravitational lens system .",
    "we also present @xmath0 magnitudes and @xmath1 colours of seven field stars , situated in the neighborhood of um673 .",
    "these results , based on data which were accumulated during a period of 3.5 months , consist in a preliminary tool for directly checking the photometric variability of the quasar .",
    "during the six - year monitoring period , we performed ccd photometry of um673 from four different observing sites . in detail , we observed at :    \\(a ) la silla ( chile ) in november 1995 , december 1996 and october 1997 . during the first two periods",
    ", we used the 0.6 m ( f/15 ) bochum telescope , in conjunction with the th7882 ccd ( 384@xmath24576 , 22 @xmath25m@xmath26  pixels ) ; in 1997 , the observations were performed with the 0.9 m dutch ( f/11 ) telescope and the tektronix tk512cb ccd ( 512@xmath24512 , 27 @xmath25m@xmath26  pixels ) .",
    "the above configurations gave a scale of 0.55@xmath27 pixel@xmath28   and 0.463@xmath27 pixel@xmath28  , corresponding to a field of view of 3.2@xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "all observations were carried out through the standard johnson @xmath0 filter .",
    "the exposure time for the first , second , and third period was 180 , 300 and 1200 sec , respectively .",

    "this time the object was observed in both the @xmath33 and @xmath0 filters , with a same exposure time of 120 sec .",
    "\\(d ) skinakas , crete ( greece ) from 2000",
    "september to 2000 december , using the 1.3 m ( f/7.7 ) ritchey - chrtien telescope .",
    "the si003b ccd chip ( 1024@xmath241024 , 24 @xmath25m@xmath26  pixels ) was the detector , giving a scale of 0.5@xmath27 pixel@xmath28 and a field of view of 8.57@xmath34 .",
    "the observations were performed in the standard johnson @xmath33 and @xmath0 filters , with an exposure time of 240 sec per image .",
    "most of the nights um673 was monitored for many hours and we have obtained , in total , images from 29 clear nights .",
    "individually , the median seeing at the bochum telescope was 15 and better at the dutch telescope , around 11 .",
    "for the night 1998 october 29 the seeing varied between 20 - 30 , while on 2000 august 23 it was of sub - arsecond quality .",
    "finally , a value between 08 to 15 was measured for the period september - december 2000 .",
    "the observational details are summarized in table  [ logbook ] .",
    "no study has ever been performed on neighbouring field stars to check the variability of the quasar , since um673 lies in a quasi - empty region of the sky .",
    "therefore , the only possibility for almost all sets of observations ( the skinakas data were the single exception ) , was to use photometric standard stars ( equatorial in our case ) to calibrate our measurements ( extinction and zero point correction ) .",
    "we mainly used the blue star hd12021 for the 1995 - 1998 missions .",
    "this photometric standard ( hipparcos identifier hip 9155 ) has been extensively observed by different observers @xcite and its properties are known with high precision .",
    "its equatorial co - ordinates are : @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; @xcite report : @xmath37 @xmath380.015 and @xmath39 . in 2000",
    "august 23 the calibration was performed by taking exposures at different airmasses of the photometric standard 113191 @xcite . for the skinakas observations ,",
    "apart from hd12021 we also used the geneva photometric standard with identification gen + 7.0093407 @xcite . > from the photometric standards observed in each mission a mean extinction coefficient and zero point were computed for every ( photometric ) night , which were then applied to the data of um673 .",
    "the data reduction was performed by developing scripts in the eso - midas environment .",
    "we applied aperture photometry on our ccd frames in order to study the photometric behavior of the _ total _ light of um673 , which is composed of the two lensed images and the lensing galaxy .",
    "we used a circular aperture of 15  to 185 diameter for this purpose , depending on the observing run conditions ( i.e. exposure time , quality of optics , seeing ) .",
    "the  no - mans - land \" was properly set , to avoid contamination from the faint galaxy seen at the south of um673 . a precise calculation of the sky background near the gravitational lens",
    "was performed by using a 25 width ring , external to  no - mans - land \" .",
    "the incorporation of errors , apart from the aperture photometry errors , included the uncertainty due to the extinction correction and the zero point correction , as computed with the help of the photometric standard stars .",
    "the reduction of the data showed that the contribution of the first factor on the daily averaged values was practically negligible ( of the order of a few milli - magnitude ) , thanks to the numerous exposures and the good observing conditions .",
    "the error due to the zero point and extinction correction was of the order of 0055 , 004 , 0015 , 004 and 0015 for the 1995 to 2000 missions , respectively .",
    "table  [ photometricresults ] contains the @xmath0-band photometric results .",
    "column 2 presents the daily averages for each run , with their accuracy , composed of all exposures of each night .",
    "column 3 contains the mean value and its standard deviation for each run .",
    "our results , together with the two @xmath0-band measurements available in the literature ( @xcite , @xcite ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ variability ] .",
    "the variability of the gravitational lens system is clearly seen in the graph .",
    "thanks to the relatively large field of view of the configuration of the skinakas 1.3 m telescope , it was possible to perform aperture photometry on ten field stars in the neighborhood of um673 , which were present in the majority of our frames .",
    "although almost all of them are fainter than the lens , an optimized combination of several factors ( i.e. photometric conditions , high quality telescope optics , precise tracking by means of an autoguider ) resulted in a large set of good quality data ( 81 frames in @xmath0 and 60 frames in @xmath33 , obtained during a period of 3.5 months ) , from which significant information on these field stars could be extracted .",
    "the variability of the field stars was checked by properly co - adding all the frames of the given night and then performing aperture photometry on them .",
    "this operation gave a set of eight frames per filter .",
    "for every frame we computed the magnitude difference , @xmath40 , of the star @xmath41 with respect to the star @xmath42 and finally obtained a mean magnitude difference , @xmath43 , for every pair of stars in the whole data set .",
    "the results obtained from the differential photometry showed that for most cases the mean errors in the magnitude differences were between 0.01 - 0.03 magnitude , except for three stars .",
    "therefore , we finally decided to reject them , and to use the rest for checking the variability of the lens .    a finding chart with the identification of the field stars is given in fig .  [ findingchart ] .",
    "by using the same photometric standards that were used for the lens , we performed a zero - point and extinction correction , converting the instrumental values to @xmath33 and @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "second order extinction correction and colour transformation were not performed .",
    "we also performed a preliminary astrometric identification with the help of the @xmath44 software , developed by e. downey ( 2000)-an interactive astronomical ephemeris program for @xmath45 windows _ is available at http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/xephem ] . by correlating our results with the co - ordinates presented in @xcite",
    ", we identified the seven field stars .",
    "table  [ referencestars ] lists the ra - dec co - ordinates of the reference stars , their @xmath0  magnitude and @xmath46  colour , including errors associated with the determination of the instrumental magnitudes .",
    "although it is approximately fifteen years since the discovery of the lens , um673 has hardly been observed .",
    "consequently , the very few existing measurements can not provide a clear view concerning the photometric behavior of the gravitational lens system before 1995 .",
    "the closest ( in time ) observations to our measurements are those performed by the @xmath20 , with a photometric system consistsing of five passbands ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "since the definition of the system is still under progress , the observations are performed using filters which are similar but _ not _ identical to the final ones , designated as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "um673 was observed by the @xmath20 group in 1995 november 24 , and in 1996 december 12 .",
    "for the first period , @xcite report @xmath51 , while for the second period @xcite report @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the transformation of the @xmath20 measurements to the johnson @xmath54 and cousins @xmath55 photometric system is a complicated task ( cf @xcite and @xcite ) and , as a consequence , a direct comparison of the @xmath20 with our measurements is not possible .",
    "nevertheless , since both we and the @xmath20 have data obtained during the same periods ( november 1995 and december 1996 ) , we tried to derive some additional conclusions on the variability of the lens by comparing the observations obtained by @xmath20 in the two different periods .    the comparison of the 1995 and 1996 @xmath20 measurements yielded ambiguous results , since the decrease of the @xmath56 magnitude shows that the lens became brighter , while a comparison of the @xmath57 and @xmath21 measurements gave the opposite conclusion . as it is mentioned in @xcite ,",
    "the main task of the 1996 @xmath20 observations was to explore the detection of qsos , based on colour selection criteria .",
    "for this reason , observations were performed even if the conditions were non - photometric . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that a comparison of the 1995 and 1996 @xmath20 measurements does not give any supplementary information on the variability of the quasar .",
    "the instrumentation used during our 1995 - 1996 missions did not allow us any additional exploitation of the data ( e.g. profile fitting of the qso components ) . hence , both a microlensing scenario and an internal variability of the quasar could equivalently explain the brightening of um673 .",
    "however , our measurements , which are characterized by a photometric precision of the order of a few hundredths of a magnitude , clearly demonstrate the 1996 peak in brightness . at the same time , they indicate that since 1997 the quasar seems to be in a less variable state , but the situation of a quiet phase can not be ruled out .",
    "we have been monitoring the gravitational lens um673 through the years 1995 - 2000 . to measure the total light of the lens ( component @xmath5 + component @xmath6 + lensing galaxy ) we constrained ourselves to aperture photometry .",
    "the numerous observations obtained during each run ( several hours per night ) , allowed us to reach a photometric precision of a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "the photometric calibration was performed with the help of several photometric standard stars .",
    "although the observations were performed using several configurations , all measurements agree with the conclusion that the qso has undergone a long term variability , that corresponds to a brightening in the total light of the system of @xmath58 0.3 magnitude in respect to its discovery value , in 1987 . from the agreement between the 1995 and 1997 measurements we see that this variability had its peak ( additional 02 brightening ) in 1996 .",
    "the @xmath0 magnitude of um673 we derived was 16.30@xmath590.02 in november 1995 , 16.08@xmath590.01 in december 1996 , 16.30@xmath590.01 in october 1997 , 16.23@xmath590.05 in october 1998 and 16.34@xmath590.01 for the last quarter of 2000 ( fig .",
    "[ variability ] ) .",
    "thanks to the optimized configuration of the skinakas observatory , we managed to have @xmath33 and @xmath0 measurements of seven field stars in the vicinity of um673 during the period september - december 2000 .",
    "although more observations are needed for a better knowledge about the stability of these stars over a longer time - basis , the photometric reduction showed no significant variability at the level 002 - 003 .",
    "the measurements obtained after 1996 seem to form a plateau at around @xmath60 , indicating that since 1997 the quasar seems to be in a less variable , or even quiet , state . nevertheless , we propose a systematic monitoring of um673 at a rate of a few images at fixed time intervals . with the help of the reference stars",
    ", differential photometry would directly show any new variability in the system .",
    "we also suggest new measurements with instruments allowing analysis of the spectra of the components for comparison with earlier ones , and photometric observations to derive the fluxes of the two qso components .",
