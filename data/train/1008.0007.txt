    "the remarkable derivation of a simple proportionality between the shear viscosity @xmath4 and the entropy per volume @xmath5 in a @xmath6 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in the limit of infinite t hooft coupling @xmath7 by policastro , son and starinets @xcite and the conjecture by kovtun , son and starinets ( kss ) @xcite that the ratio @xmath2 is larger than the value @xmath3 found in this limit for _ all _ scale invariant , relativistic field theories have motivated the search for the ` perfect fluid ' which realizes , or at least comes close to , this bound @xcite . in spite of some theoretical counter - examples @xcite",
    ", the kss conjecture turns out to be valid for all real fluids that are known .",
    "in particular , since the velocity of light does not appear in the kss bound , the conjecture is applicable to both relativistic and non - relativistic field theories and may even be extended to complex , classical fluids . in the case of water , for instance",
    ", the minimum value for the ratio @xmath2 is found close to its critical point at @xmath8k and is only a factor of @xmath9 above the kss bound @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath10 is irrelevant for the minimum value of @xmath2 of water at these temperatures . yet , as shown in [ sec : lj ] , there is a simple argument which shows that the viscosity minimum of purely classical fluids is not far above that expected from the kss bound .",
    "this begs the question what are the necessary conditions for a fluid to be ` perfect ' in the sense of a minimum value of @xmath2 that is limited only by quantum mechanics and , moreover , what is the role of scale invariance in this context ? as pointed out by kovtun , son and starinets @xcite and discussed in more detail in a number of recent lecture notes  @xcite on connections between holographic duality and many - body physics , a crucial requirement for a fluid to come close to the kss bound is the fact that it is strongly interacting and thus has no well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "indeed , in a situation with proper quasiparticles , transport coefficients like the shear viscosity can be computed using kinetic theory . since the lifetime broadening @xmath11 is much less than the average energy @xmath12 for well - defined quasiparticles , the resulting @xmath13 is typically far above the kss bound @xcite .",
    "by contrast , for strongly coupled quantum field theories , the relaxation times are expected to be of order @xmath14 .",
    "since @xmath15 is a characteristic time scale for shear relaxation , this immediately implies that @xmath2 is of order @xmath16 in the strongly coupled limit .",
    "a nontrivial example in this context is the standard @xmath17 yang - mills theory .",
    "the associated @xmath2 ratio for the pure gauge theory has been calculated numerically using lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "its minimum appears near the deconfinement transition temperature and turns out to be rather close to the kss bound .",
    "the standard yang - mills theory near @xmath18 and its supersymmetric extension  for which @xmath2 is independent of temperature and no well - defined quasiparticles exist at arbitrary energies  thus have very similar values of @xmath2 . adding fermions to the pure gauge theory ,",
    "the ratio @xmath2 becomes an experimentally accessible quantity in high - energy , non - central collisions of heavy nuclei .",
    "the observed ratio @xmath2 of the quark - gluon plasma is around @xmath19 , i.e. , a factor five above the kss bound  @xcite .    in a condensed matter context , generic examples for",
    "strongly coupled , finite temperature field theories for which no quasiparticle description holds are provided by models that exhibit a zero temperature critical point @xcite .",
    "these systems are scale invariant at a critical value @xmath20 of the coupling @xmath21 . at finite temperature @xmath22",
    ", there is a quantum critical regime above the critical point , which covers a finite window @xmath23 . in this regime ,",
    "the thermal energy @xmath12 is the only energy scale and correlations of the order parameter exhibit incoherent relaxation with a characteristic time scale @xmath24 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath25 is a constant that only depends on the universality class of the quantum phase transition .",
    "in addition , universal behavior shows up in transport coefficients like the conductivity and also the shear viscosity in the hydrodynamic regime @xmath26 .",
    "a concrete example is the pseudo - relativistic theory of graphene where the ratio @xmath27 has recently been calculated within a boltzmann equation approach .",
    "the marginally irrelevant coulomb interaction in this case gives rise to a logarithmic temperature dependence @xmath28 of the prefactor @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "this yields a monotonically increasing viscosity as the temperature approaches zero within the quantum critical regime .",
    "logarithmic singularities as @xmath30 are also present in standard 2d fermi liquids @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider the shear viscosity for the unitary fermi gas , a system of attractively interacting fermions at infinite scattering length .",
    "the unitary fermi gas is realized experimentally with ultracold atoms in a balanced mixture of , e.g. , the two lowest hyperfine levels of @xmath31li at a feshbach resonance and has been studied quite extensively over the past few years @xcite .",
    "it provides an example of a non - relativistic field theory that is both scale- and conformally invariant @xcite . the underlying quantum critical point in this case",
    "is the zero density gas at unitarity , as was shown by nikoli and sachdev @xcite . as a consequence of scale invariance ,",
    "pressure @xmath32 and energy density @xmath33 of the gas are related by @xmath34 @xcite . moreover",
    ", the bulk viscosity vanishes at all temperatures @xcite . for the shear viscosity ,",
    "quantitative results so far are only available in the high - temperature limit @xmath35 where a classical description in terms of a boltzmann equation is possible @xcite , and also deep in the superfluid regime @xmath36 . in the superfluid ,",
    "a finite viscosity arises from phonon - phonon collisions in the normal fluid component , giving rise to a rapid increase @xmath37 of the viscosity as the temperature approaches zero @xcite .",
    "since @xmath38 also increases in the classical limit , both the viscosity and the ratio @xmath2 of the unitary gas necessarily exhibit a minimum , a behavior which is in fact typical for any fluid @xcite .",
    "the major question which will be discussed in this paper , is where this minimum appears and what the associated value of the viscosity and entropy is .",
    "it turns out that the minimum in @xmath2 for the non - relativistic unitary gas is about a factor of seven above the kss bound , rather close to the value that is found for the relativistic quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we also show that the minimum in @xmath4 implies a lower bound on the shear diffusion constant @xmath39 , which is about @xmath40 .    in detail",
    ", we determine the real part @xmath0 of the frequency - dependent shear viscosity from a diagrammatic method that evaluates the stress tensor correlation function in the exact kubo formula . within a conserving approximation that respects all symmetries and the associated conservation laws",
    ", we obtain @xmath0 in the normal phase and , in particular , the static viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath41 . our results for @xmath0 show a drude - like transport peak around @xmath42 .",
    "its width defines a viscous scattering rate @xmath43 which obeys @xmath44 at high temperatures , where kinetic theory is applicable . near the transition temperature @xmath45 to the superfluid phase of the unitary gas , the width approaches @xmath46 , thus clearly invalidating a quasiparticle description of viscous transport in this regime .",
    "the weight @xmath47 of the drude peak turns out to be equal to the pressure at all temperatures , consistent with a sum rule derived recently by taylor and randeria @xcite . for large frequencies @xmath48 ,",
    "there is a crossover from the drude peak to an inverse square - root tail @xmath49 , whose amplitude is proportional to the tan contact density @xmath50 @xcite . in the high - temperature limit @xmath35",
    "we complement our numerical solution of the transport integral equations by an analytical solution to leading order in the fugacity @xmath51 .",
    "we thus confirm that @xmath52 the kubo formula yields exactly the same expression as the boltzmann equation in this limit , and @xmath53 the vertex corrections , in particular the aslamazov - larkin contributions , are crucial even in the classical limit and increase the scattering time by a factor of almost three .",
    "this resolves an inconsistency between the boltzmann equation result and a previous diagrammatic calculation in the high - temperature limit by bruun and smith @xcite .",
    "finally , we derive ward identities associated with the scale invariance of the unitary gas and show that they are obeyed within our approximation for the bulk viscosity vertices at all frequencies and temperatures . as a consequence , the bulk viscosity vanishes identically @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : unitary ] we define the microscopic model for the unitary gas and discuss its scale invariance .",
    "the basic correlation functions that allow to calculate the shear viscosity from first principles via a kubo formula are defined in section [ sec : kubo ] together with a discussion of hydrodynamic relations and sum rules . in section [ sec :",
    "alpha ] we give a qualitative discussion of the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity in the classical and in the deep superfluid limit , as well as near the superfluid transition temperature .",
    "the transport integral equations and their solution within a self - consistent luttinger - ward formalism are derived in section [ sec : calc ] .",
    "an exact solution of these equations to leading order in the fugacity is presented in section [ sec : boltzmann ] , which turns out to reproduce the full solution of the boltzmann equation in the high temperature limit . in section [ sec : results ] we discuss our results for the frequency dependent viscosity in the low temperature  but still normal fluid ",
    "regime of the unitary gas , where the assumption of independent collisions of well defined quasiparticles that underlies the boltzmann equation breaks down .",
    "in particular , we calculate the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath2 , which displays a minimum value slightly above the transition to the superfluid .",
    "conclusions and open questions are presented in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "there are three appendices : in [ sec : lj ] , we give an argument based on purely dimensional analysis which explains why the inherently quantum mechanical kss bound applies even to purely classical systems like a lennard - jones fluid .",
    "[ sec : scale ] is devoted to the derivation of the ward identities that result from scale invariance and the associated vanishing of the bulk viscosity .",
    "finally , in [ sec : contact_and_tail_coefficient ] we analytically compute the tail coefficient of the shear viscosity at large frequencies .",
    "the basic model hamiltonian that describes a two - component fermi gas with contact interactions of strength @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the kinetic energy , while @xmath58 denotes the two fermion species ( hyperfine levels in the context of cold atoms ) .",
    "since a contact interaction in three dimensions needs to be regularized , the coupling strength @xmath59 is cutoff - dependent .",
    "it is related to the renormalized physical coupling strength @xmath60 that is fixed by the scattering length @xmath61 via @xmath62 .",
    "the unitary gas corresponds to the special case @xmath63 of infinite scattering length . in order to see that the system is scale invariant at this point , it is convenient to model the contact interaction by an exchange of bosons . in a path integral",
    "language , the partition function at temperature @xmath64 can then be written as a double integral @xmath65 over grassmann fields @xmath66 , @xmath67 with @xmath68 and a complex scalar field @xmath69 , @xmath70 . in the case of a feshbach resonance , this field has a direct physical interpretation as a bound fermion pair in the closed channel .",

    "the action @xmath76 $ ] at this point is invariant under scale transformations @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the fermionic field @xmath79 transforms with the canonical scaling dimension , while the bosonic field @xmath80 acquires an anomalous dimension . as a result ,",
    "the dynamics of the bosons , which arises from the second term in equation , is irrelevant at unitarity .",
    "the description of a finite fermion density requires adding a contribution @xmath81 to the action . with a fixed value of the chemical potential @xmath82 ,",
    "this term explicitly breaks scale invariance .",
    "for the unitary gas , however , the relation @xmath83 between the chemical potential and the fermi wave vector @xmath84 is identical to that of an ideal fermi gas , except for a universal constant @xmath85 that describes the lowering of the fermi energy due to the attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "a scale transformation thus leaves the action invariant provided @xmath86 is changed accordingly to account for the change in density .",
    "alternatively , one may introduce the chemical potential through a special choice for the ( common ) phase of the fields @xmath87 and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "scale invariance gives rise to a conserved dilatation current @xcite which implies the relation @xmath88 and the vanishing of the bulk viscosity : during a uniform expansion the system remains self - similar and no entropy is produced @xcite .",
    "in fact , the bulk viscosity of the unitary gas vanishes for _ all _ frequencies @xcite , a result that will be derived from an exact ward identity in [ sec : scale ] . a subtle point in this context is the issue of whether scale invariance of the action will be present in the full theory , i.e. , whether the classical symmetry of @xmath89 survives quantum fluctuations @xcite . for the unitary gas with equal masses of the two spin components , which is the situation discussed in this work ,",
    "this is believed to be the case . for different masses ,",
    "however , scale invariance will be broken due to the appearance of an efimov effect , i.e. , three- and four - body bound states appear even in the absence of a two - body bound state @xcite . in particular , four - body bound states",
    "appear for mass ratios larger than a critical value @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the breaking of scale invariance through the appearance of an efimov effect has been discussed so far mostly for bosons @xcite and leads to limit cycle flows in a renormalization group treatment @xcite .",
    "the unitary fermi gas is in a fluid state at arbitrary temperatures and thus has well defined bulk and shear viscosities @xmath91 and @xmath4 . on a microscopic level ,",
    "the viscosities are the zero frequency limits of linear response functions that may be calculated from first principles by the kubo formula .",
    "specifically , both the shear and bulk viscosities follow from the retarded correlation functions of the stress tensor @xmath92 ( in the zero external momentum limit ) , @xmath93 \\bigr\\rangle \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and its imaginary parts @xmath94 , which are odd functions of @xmath95 . in particular , the real part of the frequency dependent shear viscosity is determined by the associated positive and even spectral function @xmath96 and its static limit @xmath97 . a completely analogous expression exists for the bulk viscosity @xmath98 which involves the trace @xmath99 of the stress tensor , @xmath100",
    "the microscopic expression for the stress tensor operator that enters equation for a non - relativistic quantum many - body system has been derived by martin and schwinger @xcite . in the case of a scale - invariant short - range potential , where @xmath101 , it is given by @xmath102 the second term explicitly involves the interaction and guarantees that the stress tensor satisfies local momentum current conservation as an operator equation ( see appendix b in ref.@xcite ) . in the zero - frequency limit ,",
    "the kinetic part of the stress tensor is the one that appears in the viscous terms of the hydrodynamic equations @xcite , and also as a source term in the boltzmann equation @xcite . in general , the two contributions to the stress tensor describe physically different processes for momentum relaxation upon insertion into the kubo formula .",
    "in particular , the correlation function of two interaction contributions describes collisional transport due to interparticle forces , which is in fact the dominant contribution in the liquid phase @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the kinetic part is associated with the transfer of transverse momentum due to free particle motion and dominates in the gaseous phase . as will be shown in section  [ sec : calc ] , for the unitary gas the interaction part of the stress tensor is important to guarantee that the bulk viscosity vanishes , however it gives no contribution to the shear viscosity due to the zero - range nature of the interaction .",
    "quite generally , momentum current conservation implies that the stress tensor correlation functions are directly related to the current correlation functions , which are defined by @xmath103 \\bigr\\rangle \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath104 the current operator . in the limit @xmath105",
    ", these correlation functions acquire a simple form , dictated by hydrodynamics . in particular , the existence of a finite shear viscosity implies diffusive relaxation of the transverse currents @xcite .",
    "the transverse part of the current correlation spectral function thus has the generic form ( for small @xmath106 ) @xmath107 with a diffusion constant @xmath108 that is directly proportional to the shear viscosity .",
    "indeed , the sum rule @xmath109 which quite generally defines the normal fluid density @xmath110 @xcite immediately implies an einstein relation @xmath111 between the shear viscosity and the associated diffusion constant that was first derived by hohenberg and martin @xcite . the shear viscosity can thus be defined both from the stress tensor correlation function and , alternatively , from the diffusion constant that appears in the transverse current response @xcite . for non - superfluid systems , the diffusion constant @xmath39 is identical to the standard kinematic viscosity @xmath112 .    for strongly interacting fluids ,",
    "an exact calculation of correlation functions like the ones in equation is hardly possible .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to find constraints that allow to check the validity of approximate calculations .",
    "such constraints are derived generically from a short - time expansion of the correlation functions that can be expressed in terms of equilibrium expectation values of certain commutators . for the viscosities of a fermi gas with contact interactions ,",
    "this has been achieved recently by taylor and randeria @xcite .",
    "as will be shown in section  [ sec : calc ] below , a straightforward derivation of the relevant sum rule can be given using a ward identity due to polyakov @xcite , who has discussed the behavior of the shear viscosity near the critical point of a neutral superfluid within a microscopic approach .",
    "this ward identity , which follows from momentum conservation , implies that the frequency - dependent shear viscosity at arbitrary values of the scattering length @xmath61 obeys the sum rule @xmath113    = \\frac{2\\varepsilon}{3 } - \\frac{\\hbar^2c}{6\\pi ma }    = p - \\frac{\\hbar^2c}{4\\pi ma } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , in the second form of the equality , we have used the non - trivial relation between energy density and pressure away from unitarity , first derived by tan @xcite .",
    "the sum rule has precisely the form given by taylor and randeria @xcite , however their high - frequency tail coefficient @xmath114 is larger by a factor of @xmath115 and there is also a difference in the prefactor of the contribution proportional to @xmath116 away from unitarity .",
    "the sum rule implies that @xmath0 decays like @xmath117 at large frequencies with a prefactor that is determined by the tan contact density @xmath50 , which is a measure for two fermions with opposite spin to be close together @xcite .",
    "moreover , the area under the frequency - dependent viscosity of the unitary gas is fixed by the equilibrium pressure , since the @xmath118 term is absent at unitarity .",
    "both features are verified with high accuracy by our calculations of @xmath0 that are detailed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "for the unitary gas , the density @xmath119 fixes both the momentum and energy scale , which are the fermi wavevector @xmath84 and the associated fermi energy @xmath120 . since the viscosity has dimensions @xmath121 , purely dimensional arguments require the static shear viscosity to be of the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the dimensionless temperature scale and @xmath124 a universal scaling function .",
    "remarkably , this function is fixed up to a universal constant @xmath125 in the high temperature limit .",
    "this is based on the counter - intuitive fact that the viscosity of a classical gas is independent of its density @xcite . since @xmath126",
    ", this requires @xmath127 , i.e. , a shear viscosity that increases like @xmath128 . the same qualitative result is obtained from the kinetic theory expression @xmath129 with @xmath130 an average momentum and @xmath131 a thermally averaged cross section .",
    "since the differential cross section for a collision with a given relative momentum @xmath32 is @xmath132 at unitarity , this immediately gives @xmath133 with @xmath134 the thermal momentum .",
    "note that @xmath4 scales like @xmath135 even in the classical limit , provided the assumption of zero range s - wave scattering remains valid in this regime .    at low temperatures @xmath136 ,",
    "the unitary fermi gas is a superfluid .",
    "contrary to naive expectations , a superfluid is not a ` perfect fluid ' despite the fact that there is a vanishing viscosity here . in particular",
    ", superfluids do not provide trivial counter - examples to the kss conjecture .",
    "indeed , according to the landau two - fluid picture , the superfluid component has both zero viscosity and zero entropy , so @xmath2 is undefined at @xmath137 . at any finite temperature",
    ", however , a normal component appears , whose entropy and viscosity are non - zero . for the bosonic superfluid @xmath138he this was discussed already by landau and khalatnikov in 1949  @xcite . in the low temperature , phonon - dominated regime , they found that the shear viscosity of the normal component grows like @xmath139 because the mean free path for phonon - phonon collisions , which are necessary for the relaxation of shear , diverges .",
    "specifically , with the assumption that the phonon dispersion has negative curvature and thus no beliaev decay is possible ( this assumption is actually violated in superfluid @xmath138he but is likely to hold for the unitary fermi gas , see @xcite ) , the calculations of landau and khalatnikov predict the low temperature shear viscosity to be @xmath140 here @xmath141 is the normal fluid mass density and @xmath142 is the dimensionless strength of the non - linear corrections to the leading - order quantum hydrodynamic hamiltonian which lead to phonon - phonon scattering .",
    "the viscosity of the normal fluid component thus asymptotically diverges like @xmath139 . as realized by rupak and schfer  @xcite the same behavior",
    "is expected in the unitary fermi gas .",
    "indeed , at temperatures far below @xmath18 , the microscopic nature of the superfluid is irrelevant and the linearly dispersing bogoliubov - anderson phonons are the only excitations that remain . as a result ,",
    "equation for the viscosity applies also to the unitary fermi gas , provided the exact values of the sound velocity @xmath143 and coupling constant @xmath144 are inserted . at unitarity , the sound velocity @xmath145 is directly proportional to the fermi velocity @xmath146 with a factor that is determined by the universal bertsch parameter @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath148 as for an ideal fermi gas , the dimensionless coupling constant that fixes the strength of the phonon - phonon scattering amplitude has the universal value @xmath149 . together with the standard low - temperature expression @xmath150 for the entropy density of a scalar phonon field ,",
    "the viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath151 of the unitary fermi gas at temperatures far below the superfluid transition diverges rapidly as @xmath152 .",
    "the associated prefactor agrees within @xmath153 with that found from a diagrammatic calculation by rupak and schfer  @xcite , which is based on the next - to - leading terms in the effective field theory of the unitary gas by son and wingate @xcite ( note the different prefactor of the entropy in @xcite ) .",
    "it is a pure number that only contains the bertsch parameter .",
    "note that due to @xmath154 at very low temperatures , the ratio @xmath155 is just the characteristic relaxation time @xmath156 for shear fluctuations .",
    "according to equation , this relaxation time diverges like @xmath157 as @xmath30 , much stronger than the pure thermal energy time scale @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , the latter would lead to a viscosity to entropy density ratio which approaches a constant at very low temperatures , as in the @xmath158 supersymmetric yang - mills theory , where no quasiparticles exist .",
    "near the superfluid transition temperature @xmath18 , the universal scaling function @xmath124 will be continuous , yet there will be singularities in higher derivatives . within the conventional theory of critical dynamics ,",
    "the non - analytical behavior of @xmath159 near @xmath18 only comes from the thermodynamic singularity in @xmath160 @xcite . since @xmath161 with @xmath162 a positive constant and @xmath163 the universal critical exponent of the 3d xy - model ,",
    "the conventional theory predicts that @xmath124 reaches its finite value at @xmath18 with an infinite slope as the critical temperature is approached from below @xcite . a non - analytical temperature dependence of the shear viscosity is indeed observed near the @xmath164 point of superfluid @xmath138he . in this case , however",
    ", a singularity of the form signlatexmath:[$(t)\\ ,    associated exponent @xmath95 is consistent with the prediction @xmath166 of conventional theory below @xmath18 , however it has a different value @xmath167 above the critical temperature .",
    "this behavior can be explained within a semi - phenomenological approach @xcite which is , however , genuine for a liquid state .",
    "thus it can not be carried over to the case of the unitary fermi gas , for which the precise behavior of @xmath124 near the critical point remains an open problem .",
    "in order to compute the stress correlation functions we start from the single - channel model and derive the corresponding stress tensor in the two - channel model . this has the advantage that the potential ( fermion interaction ) term of the stress tensor becomes simply a detuning ( mass term ) of the bosonic field in the two - channel model .",
    "we then derive the exact expression for the stress correlation function in the two - channel model , including both kinetic and potential terms , in the zero - range limit .",
    "this expression is evaluated in the self - consistent t - matrix approximation @xcite . in the two - channel model",
    "we compute the fermionic and bosonic self - energies self - consistently at the one - loop level but neglect the loop corrections to the yukawa coupling between fermions and bosons which appear only at two - loop order ( cf.fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ) .",
    "variation of these coupled single - particle equations with respect to a time - dependent external field results in a set of transport equations for the viscosity response functions .",
    "a crucial feature of this procedure is that it respects the symmetries of the underlying model exactly , in particular it obeys scale invariance and thus leads to a vanishing bulk viscosity as required .",
    "since the continuum model is galilean invariant , one may expand the stress tensor operator of the single - channel model into spherical harmonics with angular - momentum quantum number @xmath168 : @xmath169 where the spherical harmonics @xmath170 depend on the angle of the vector @xmath171 as @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",

    "the ratio @xmath2 between shear viscosity and entropy density exhibits a minimum slightly above the superfluid transition temperature .",
    "the corresponding value @xmath353 is a factor of about seven above the kss bound , the smallest value found for non - relativistic fluids so far .",
    "there are , of course , a number of problems that remain open . for the unitary gas ,",
    "precise results for the shear viscosity near @xmath18 and also immediately below the superfluid transition are required to obtain definite predictions for the location and the associated value of the minimum in both @xmath4 and in @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , a quantitative understanding of current experiments on the inter - diffusion of the two spin components @xcite requires to study particle transport by a calculation of the conductivity from the longitudinal current correlation function . another transport coefficient that may be determined by an extension of our present method is the heat diffusion constant .",
    "its ratio with the shear diffusion constant determines the prandtl number , which is equal to unity in non - relativistic , conformal field theories with a holographic dual  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is of interest to study the situation away from unitarity , where scale invariance is broken and a finite bulk viscosity appears . since both @xmath4 and the ratio @xmath2 will exhibit a minimum as a function of temperature for _ arbitrary _ values of @xmath358 along the bcs - bec crossover , this would allow to answer the question whether the minimum found at unitarity indeed gives the lowest possible value and thus , whether scale invariance is an important ingredient for a minimum in @xmath2 in a non - relativistic context .",
    "in fact , the entropy density at @xmath18 has its largest value not at unitarity but near @xmath359 @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the viscosity along the complete bcs - bec crossover has been performed in one dimension , where a finite bulk viscosity exists at @xmath137 @xcite . in this case , the zero temperature viscosity is actually smallest in the bec limit .",

    "in this appendix we give an elementary argument , based on dimensional analysis only , for the quite surprising observation that the kss bound which arises from genuine quantum field theory considerations , even applies to classical fluids , whose viscosity minimum apparently can not depend on @xmath10 .",
    "an example is water , a rather complex fluid , that has a minimum viscosity near its critical point at @xmath360k .",
    "since a viscosity has units energy density times seconds , the ratio @xmath361 is a pure number , which happens to be of order one , @xmath362 at the viscosity minimum .",
    "this appears to indicate that quantum mechanics determines the minimum viscosity of water despite the fact that the thermal wavelength @xmath363 near its critical point is much smaller than the average interparticle spacing @xmath364 .    to understand the origin of this surprising fact , consider a simple model for a classical fluid , which assumes pairwise central forces that are derived from a lennard - jones potential @xmath365 \\ , .\\ ] ] this potential is , of course , not a realistic model for such complex fluids as water , yet it provides a rather good quantitative description of simple fluids like argon @xcite .",
    "the two parameters @xmath232 and @xmath219 of this potential provide the characteristic scales for length and energy . as a result , the equation of state @xmath366 is completely determined by a universal function @xmath367 of the dimensionless density @xmath368 and the dimensionless temperature @xmath369 .",
    "this provides an explanation for the law of corresponding states for different fluids that are reasonably well described by an interaction of the lennard - jones type . to evaluate dynamic correlation functions like",
    "the viscosity from a ( classical ) kubo formula for this lennard - jones fluid requires in addition the particle mass @xmath370 , which fixes a characteristic time scale @xmath371 . by purely dimensional arguments",
    "the shear viscosity of the lennard - jones fluid is then of the form @xmath372 with a universal function @xmath373 .",
    "in fact , equation also applies for the bulk viscosity @xmath91 , which is typically of the same order as @xmath4 in classical fluids @xcite . in the",
    "high - temperature , gaseous limit @xmath374 this function can be calculated from kinetic theory , where @xmath375 is a ratio between an average momentum and a thermally averaged cross section @xmath131 . for large temperatures ,",
    "the cross section @xmath376 scales with an inverse power of the thermal momentum @xmath265 .",
    "the exponent is determined by the short range repulsive potential @xmath377 . for a lennard - jones fluid with @xmath378 , the universal function @xmath379 ,",
    "therefore , exhibits a power - law increase with temperature , independent of density . at low temperatures",
    "the viscosity will again increase and eventually the response @xmath380 becomes purely reactive at the liquid - to - solid transition , which appears at densities @xmath381 @xcite ( note that this is the density at the freezing point , which is smaller than the melting point density due to the first order nature of the transition .",
    "note also that a gas of hard spheres with diameter @xmath232 reaches close packing only at @xmath382 ) .",
    "numerical results for the dimensionless function @xmath383 are available from molecular - dynamics simulations . for the lennard - jones fluid",
    ", they were first performed by levesque et al .",
    "for example , the resulting value is @xmath384 near the triple point and close to the solidification line @xcite . the minimum of the viscosity is necessarily reached near the gas - liquid transition , which lies between the triple and the critical point . for the lennard - jones fluid , the dimensionless densities and temperatures at these points are of order unity : @xmath385 and @xmath386 , respectively @xcite . from equation , it is thus obvious that the minimum value of the shear viscosity of a lennard - jones liquid @xmath387 is fixed by the microscopic ratio @xmath388 with a universal prefactor of order unity , that unfortunately seems not to have been calculated so far .",
    "clearly , this minimum value does not contain @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , the condition for the applicability of classical physics to describe the behavior near the gas - liquid transition of the lennard - jones fluid is @xmath389 , which implies that @xmath390 .",
    "the minimum value of the viscosity is therefore much larger than @xmath391 as long as the standard de boer parameter @xmath392 is very small . in practice , however , the de boer parameter is still appreciable unless one considers fluids of very heavy elements like xe .",
    "the associated conversion factor from equation to a purely quantum limited viscosity @xmath393 is therefore not that large",
    ". stated differently , for most fluids the zero - point energy @xmath394 associated with the typical length scale of interatomic potentials is not much smaller than the well depth @xmath219 .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that , after all , it is the combination of the quantum mechanical van der waals interaction at large separations and the short range scale @xmath232 that arises from the pauli principle which determines the ratio @xmath388 .",
    "it is , therefore , quantum mechanics which eventually fixes the minimum value of the viscosity of classical liquids to be of order @xmath10 times the liquid density . with a corresponding entropy density @xmath395",
    ", this immediately yields a minimum value of @xmath2 that is not too far above the kss bound , despite the fact that both the viscosity and the entropy may be inferred by completely classical considerations .",
    "in this appendix we show that scale invariance and the associated continuity equation for the conserved dilatation current imply ward identities which relate the fermionic and bosonic _ bulk _ viscosity vertices to the respective single - particle green s functions . as a consequence the bulk viscosity vanishes identically in our approach as required by symmetry . in particular",
    "this allows us to check the consistency of the viscosity vertices that have been computed explicitly .",
    "the trace of the stress tensor defined in equations and , @xmath396 is twice the hamiltonian in scale - invariant models @xcite .",
    "the expectation value of this operator equation yields immediately @xmath397 @xcite , as shown explicitly in equation . the fermionic bulk viscosity response function @xmath398 in equation can thus be written in imaginary time @xmath399 as @xmath400 the effects of scale invariance are already incorporated in equation , and the evaluation of expectation values of the hamiltonian yields a time derivative ( * ? ? ?",

    "the coefficient of equation linear in @xmath405 is then @xmath406 a fourier transform of the viscosity response function from imaginary time @xmath399 to matsubara frequency @xmath253 and from @xmath407 , @xmath408 to incoming momenta @xmath409 and outgoing momenta @xmath410 yields @xmath411 , or @xmath412 hence , the bulk viscosity response function is given by a difference of two single - particle green s functions multiplied by their energies .",
    "this ward identity holds exactly and has been derived without reference to the t - matrix approximation used above in section  [ sec : calc ] .",
    "one can easily check the ward identity in the non - interacting case where @xmath413 and @xmath414 . as an alternative to starting with equation , which is already a consequence of scale invariance , we have also derived the ward identity by applying the local conformal transformation @xmath415 in ref .",
    "@xcite to the generating functional of the green s functions , with the same result .",
    "we note that scale plus galilean invariance imply conformal invariance @xcite and that both are necessary for a vanishing bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "a corresponding ward identity holds for the bosonic viscosity response function , which is given by the difference of two vertex functions @xmath416 , @xmath417 these ward identities provide a solution to the t - matrix transport equations  , as one can check by plugging in the ward identities and on the right - hand side .",
    "thus we have proven that the t - matrix approximation conserves not only charge , momentum and energy but also the dilatation current ( scale invariance ) .    from the ward identities of scale invariance it follows that the bulk viscosity computed via equation vanishes for any frequency , temperature or density",
    ", @xmath418 indeed , the fermionic ward identity for @xmath419 implies by a shift of the frequency that the first term of the stress correlation function vanishes identically . the bosonic ward identity implies , again by a shift of frequency , that @xmath420 such that also the second term of the correlation function vanishes identically .    this result has been obtained previously in different ways @xcite .",
    "for instance , it follows in a rather direct manner from a sum rule @xmath421 for the bulk viscosity that has been derived by taylor and randeria @xcite .",
    "the fact that the derivative @xmath422 is finite at unitarity and that @xmath423 is a positive function , immediately implies that the bulk viscosity of the unitary gas at @xmath201 vanishes at arbitrary frequencies .",
    "one can compute the viscosity tail @xmath338 defined in equation , @xmath424 in at least four different ways : from the current correlation function , from the stress tensor correlation function , from the relation between the shear viscosity and the density correlation function , and from the viscosity sum rule . in this appendix",
    "we will analytically compute @xmath338 at unitarity by the first two methods , thus confirming equation .",
    "the identical result is obtained by considering the high - frequency behavior of the density correlation function , as has already been shown in section  [ sec : results ] , and from the sum rule .",

    "these are the self - energy ( s ) , maki - thompson ( mt ) and aslamazov - larkin ( al ) diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : firstorder ] ( see also ( * ? ? ? * fig .  6 ) ) , @xmath429 in each of these diagrams the vertex function @xmath247 is replaced by its value at @xmath430 , @xmath431 which defines the contact density @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the remaining part of the diagram is evaluated at zero bosonic wavenumber @xmath432 and matsubara frequency @xmath433 , @xmath434 to this order in the pair propagator , the fermionic green s functions are bare @xmath435 and have spectral weight only on - shell . then to absorb an external high - energy perturbation with frequency @xmath95 , fermions are excited to very high momenta @xmath436 , which are much larger than the fermi or thermal momentum scales .",
    "hence only few - body physics is probed and it is sufficient to evaluate the diagrams in the vacuum limit @xmath437 and set the fermi functions to zero .    specifically , we obtain for the self - energy contribution to the current correlation function @xmath438 with the current vertex insertion @xmath439 squared and shifted momenta @xmath440 .",
