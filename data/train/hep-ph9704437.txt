    "many body charm meson decays seem to be largely dominated by intermediate resonances .",
    "experimental data have been studied using the powerful dalitz plot technique which brings information on both the kinematics and the dynamics of the decay @xcite .    in a @xmath4 meson three body decay ,",
    "the intermediate resonant channels and the direct non - resonant one contribute to the final state .",
    "the dalitz plot can thus present a complex interference of all these contributions . to extract them from the plot",
    ", one has to use appropriate fitting functions for each channel . since the discovery of @xmath4 mesons",
    ", data are fitted using a breit  wigner function for each resonance amplitude @xcite while the non - resonant ( nr ) contribution has usually been considered as a phase space independent , constant function .    in a recent paper@xcite",
    ", we have shown that the last hypothesis can not be safely considered for the study of d meson decays as it proceeds via a weak interaction . indeed , in weak interactions at the partonic level helicity plays a central role",
    "; thus one could expect the amplitude of the reaction to have important variations within the phase space . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the nr contribution to @xmath5 decay has been evaluated using factorization and an effective hamiltonian for the partonic interaction @xcite . according to this calculation",
    ", the nr contribution does have significant variations along the phase space of the reaction .    to extract data from the dalitz plot",
    ", an adequate parametrization of the nr contribution is crucial .",
    "a correct extraction of the nr contribution could yield important information on the physics involving the decay ; particularly , it can bring direct measurements of some form factors .",
    "moreover , using an inadequate parametrization for the nr contribution , the whole decay pattern could be wrong : we could be ascribing to a given resonance those variations corresponding to the nr part .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present two examples concerning these ideas .",
    "first , we will analyse the decay @xmath0 , since its @xmath6 partial decay width seems to be too large .",
    "second , we will show how the @xmath1 decay is particularly well suited to extract a form factor which is relevant in @xmath7 and @xmath3-meson physics .",
    "the resonant decay @xmath9 has been measured in two different ways , according to the detected final state : @xmath10 , which is extracted from the dalitz plot of the decay @xmath0 ; and @xmath11 , extracted from the decay @xmath5 .",
    "markiii reported @xcite an `` apparent discrepancy '' between the two measurements : @xmath12 when the final state is @xmath13 and @xmath14 when the final state is @xmath15 .",
    "the last measurement has been confirmed by other experiments@xcite while the decay @xmath0 has only been measured by markiii .",
    "it is then natural to think on a possible systematic error in the extraction of the @xmath16 resonance from the @xmath0 dalitz plot .",
    "one possibility is that events coming from the nr contribution to the decay could have been incorrectly considered as originated from the @xmath16 resonant channel ; thus , the latter has been artificially enhanced .    to support this hypothesis",
    ", we are presenting here a calculation for the nr part of the decay @xmath0 which shows up precisely an important bump near the @xmath16 peak .",
    "the calculation is based in factorization @xcite and in an effective hamiltonian @xcite for the partonic interaction as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effective partonic hamiltonian is@xcite    @xmath17 \\label{heff}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is a short - hand notation for @xmath19 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath20 characterize the contribution of the effective charged and neutral currents respectively , which include short - distance qcd effects .",
    "figure 1 shows the six diagrams contributing to the amplitude @xmath21 . using factorization",
    "one obtains the following decomposition@xcite for the hadronic amplitude of the non - resonant decay @xmath22 ~. \\label{mdkpp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    following ref .",
    "@xcite , the four contributions can be written as @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 \\ :",

    "the ten form factors originate from the hadronic matrix elements@xcite ; we will be back to them later on .",
    "diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) and ( e ) of fig . 1 exhibit an external light pseudoscalar meson ( p ) .",
    "this yields a contribution proportional to @xmath33 as one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ diaga ] ) and ( [ diagb ] ) .",
    "the other diagrams , i.e. , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( f ) , produce contributions proportional to @xmath34 as one can see from eqs .",
    "( [ diagc ] ) and ( [ diagd ] ) , together with eq .",
    "( [ ident ] ) . thus the two first contributions in eq .",
    "( [ mdkpp ] ) can be safely neglected in favor of the last two . moreover , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ diagc ] ) can be neglected as it is proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the eight form factors entering in eqs .",
    "( [ diagc ] ) and ( [ diagd ] ) are written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 or 1 and @xmath38 or @xmath39 , and @xmath40 where @xmath41 or 0 and @xmath42 or @xmath43 . according to the remark above",
    ", only six of them contribute to our calculation .",
    "five of these form factors have been either measured from semileptonic decays , or calculated using lattice qcd or different quark models .",
    "there are no major discrepancies in the literature @xcite : @xmath44 , @xmath45 ; @xmath46 , @xmath47 ; @xmath48 , @xmath49 ; @xmath50 , @xmath51 ; @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "the sixth form factor entering in our calculation , @xmath54 , has neither been measured nor obtained using lattice calculations .",
    "one can only hint @xmath55 calculating @xcite the decay width @xmath56 and comparing it with experiment , to get @xmath55 = 1.4 .    finally , the only measurement we have for the effective parameters @xmath3 and @xmath20 come from the fit of two body charm meson decays .",
    "it has been found @xcite @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we have performed a monte carlo simulation of the nr contribution to the decay @xmath0 using eqs .",
    "( [ mdkpp ] ) , ( [ diagc ] ) and ( [ diagd ] ) .",
    "figure 2 presents the dalitz plot corresponding to the nr contribution to the decay , according to the calculation presented above .",
    "figure 3 shows the density of events as a function of the invariant variable @xmath59 .",
    "it presents a pronounced bump centered in @xmath60 gev@xmath61 .",
    "the figures shown have been obtained using the central values of all the parameters presented above .",
    "the bump remains unchanged doing any variation of these parameters within the region allowed by experiment and lattice calculation and a very large variations for the unknown parameters defining the @xmath54 form factor .",
    "the bump is also unchanged within a large variation of the ratio @xmath62 .",
    "this strong stability of the bump in the simulation results shown in fig .",
    "3 is due to the following : it turns out that if the ratio @xmath63 is not very large ( in fact , smaller than about 2.5 ) , then the contribution of eq .",
    "( [ diagc ] ) largely drives the behavior of the @xmath59 distribution .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath64 since the form factors in ( [ mfin ] ) depend only on @xmath65 , the @xmath66 distribution of the events is thus almost independent of the various poorly known quantities associated with the decay . for comparison ,",
    "we present in figure 4 the @xmath66 distribution of events when no dynamics is assumed for the nr decay , i.e. , @xmath67 = const .",
    "the bump in figure 3 is thus a robust signature of a factorization - based calculation .",
    "however , as some non - perturbative qcd effects  as final state interactions and soft gluon exchange  have been neglected , it is possible that factorization does not suffice to describe the decay . in the extreme case where the non - perturbative effects dominate the decay ,",
    "the structure predicted above can be washed out .",
    "thus , the experimental determination of a bump in the nr contribution to the decay @xmath0 centered at @xmath68 gev@xmath61 would be a test for the validity of factorization in @xmath4 decays .",
    "the bump predicted by this calculation lies near the peak one expects for the breit - wigner distribution corresponding to the @xmath16 resonance .",
    "if non - factorizable terms does not completely eliminate the bump , many events originated from the nr decay @xmath0 have been probably incorrectly ascribed to the @xmath69 resonant channel .    for completeness , we present in figure 5 the @xmath70 distribution of events for the nr part of the decay @xmath5 .",
    "we use the amplitude we obtained in ref .",
    "there is no bump near the the @xmath16 squared mass .",
    "it looks more like a simple phase space distribution , as that of figure 4 .",
    "thus , the difference between the nr contributions of the decays @xmath5 and @xmath0 could explain the different values reported for the decay @xmath71 according to the final state .",
    "it is an example of the indirect consequences of assuming inadequately a constant nr function to fit data .",
    "a correct extraction of the nr contribution to a given charmed many body decay could also have other important advantages .",
    "as we have shown above , the nr contribution to a given heavy meson decay is written in terms of various form factors .",
    "thus , its correct extraction from the dalitz plot could also be a way to measure those form factors within the whole phase space of the reaction .",
    "two problems arise here .",
    "first , one has to accept that non - factorizable effects are small , so that the expression of the nr amplitude in terms of the form factors can be simply obtained using factorization hypothesis  as we did above and in ref .",
    "second , even assuming the validity of factorization , those expressions are products of form factors and it is thus complicated to extract separately each of them .",
    "we present here an example in which these two problems are supposed to be not important .",
    "it is the case of the decay @xmath1 .",
    "the main reason is that there is only one diagram contributing to the decay and it is an annihilation diagram .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "6 . in this case",
    ", following bjorken ideas@xcite , factorization looks natural .",
    "one thus expects the decay to be simply described by : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and the second matrix element can be decomposed in four form factors@xcite .",
    "the only remaining term is the axial spin 0 one , i.e. , similar to the one appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ diaga ] ) and ( [ diagb ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    the second problem raised above",
    "is naturally solved in this particular decay : the amplitude is proportional to just one form factor ; thus , one can directly extract it from the plot .    in two body decays of d mesons",
    ", amplitudes proportional to @xmath34 only happen through spectator diagrams while those contributions coming from non spectator diagrams  as the one we are considering here  are proportional to the masses of the final state mesons , and thus less important . since the amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ dsfin ] ) is proportional to @xmath77 , in principle , it is not small . nevertheless , if one assumes pcac to be valid  due to the fact that final state quarks are light ",
    "one expects this decay to be small , and this can only happen if the @xmath78 form factor is negligible .",
    "however , the validity of pcac in this context is not clear , as we will see in the following .",
    "the @xmath78 form factor@xcite has never been measured and there are no clear theoretical predictions for it .",
    "some authors@xcite proposed expressions based in models that are valid only for small values of the squared momentum transfered to the three pions , @xmath79 .",
    "however , in the decay @xmath1 , @xmath80 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath78 will have important consequences on the understanding of @xmath7 and @xmath3 meson physics .",
    "the @xmath3 width can be measured through the decay @xmath2 but its value turns out to be 2 or even 3 times larger than the value extracted from other measurements@xcite .",
    "the value of the @xmath3 width extracted from the decay @xmath2 strongly depends on the magnitude of a possible non - resonant decay , which is driven by @xmath78 , i.e. the same form factor involved in the nr decay @xmath1 .",
    "experimental measurements@xcite of the channel @xmath2 can not distinguish between models predicting a large amount of pcac breaking@xcite , i.e. a large @xmath78 , from those predicting a small amount of this breaking@xcite .",
    "both a large and a small @xmath78 are acceptable , but the extracted values of the @xmath3 width can vary by as much as a factor of two when fitting data using the first or the second kind of model .    thus , the correct extraction of the nr part of the decay @xmath1 can bring a first measurement of the form factor @xmath78 , clarifying the amount of pcac breaking and then helping to extract the correct value of the @xmath3 meson width . at present , the existent measurements of the decay @xmath1 are not consistent : the branching ratio ( br ) for the nr decay measured from the e691 experiment @xcite is @xmath81 %  implying a large @xmath78  while preliminary results from e687@xcite give a value of this br as small as @xmath82 %  presenting a smaller @xmath78 .",
    "they have both been obtained using a constant function to fit the nr contribution .",
    "in this work , we discuss on some of the consequences of our previous claim@xcite that nr contributions in @xmath4 meson decays can not be fitted with a constant as they usually are .",
    "we show here that important physics information is hidden in this contribution which has been loosely considered up to now .",
    "we present two examples to show the information one could obtain if the nr contribution were correctly extracted from the dalitz plot .",
    "first , we argue that in the decay @xmath0 events produced via the nr channel could have been assumed to be originated from the @xmath16 resonant contribution . using a model based in factorization",
    ", we showed that nr have a bump near the @xmath16 squared mass .",
    "this bump is very stable within a large variation of some poorly known quantities entering in the calculated amplitude .",
    "it is thus a strong prediction of factorization .",
    "second , we claim here that an adequate extraction of the nr contribution from data could allow us to measure unknown form factors .",
    "the @xmath1 is particularly interesting : its amplitude can be factorized to give a contribution proportional to the @xmath78 form factor .",
    "this form factor drives the spin zero part of the axial current matrix element describing the decay in three pions .",
    "it is very relevant to the decay @xmath2 .",
    "different model predictions could be tested and the longstanding problem concerning the @xmath3 meson width will benefit from this crucial information .",
    "coming experiments on charmed meson decays are expected to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays with high statistics . using a non - constant function for the nr contribution when fitting the decay from its dalitz plot , it will be possible to extract adequately the nr contributions .",
    "this will a ) clarify the eventual discrepancy in the @xmath9 decay width , b ) test the validity of factorization technique when applied to d meson decays and c ) bring a first measurement of the relevant form factor @xmath78 ."
