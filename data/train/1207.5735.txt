    "few - body physics provides a solid starting point for analysing various nonperturbative approaches and methods which can then be used for studying more complicated many - body problems .",
    "the study of few - body systems also allows us to determine the input parameters needed for those complex problems , without the need to rely on further approximations .",
    "one promising method is the functional renormalisation group ( frg ) @xcite , as it provides a framework that can simultaneously describe both few- and many - body systems .",
    "some reviews of the method and its applications can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the approach is based on a running effective action ( rea ) which is a generalisation of the standard quantum mechanical effective action  the generating functional of the one - particle irreducible green functions .",
    "the rea includes the effects of all the fluctuations with momenta in the region @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a running scale .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a regulator that , either sharply or smoothly , suppresses the contribution of modes with @xmath3 .",
    "the frg describes the evolution of this action as the cut - off scale @xmath2 is lowered . as @xmath2 approaches zero , all fluctuations are included and thus the full effective action is recovered .",
    "the frg method has already been applied to few - body problems in a number of papers @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was exploited to derive the skornyakov  ter - martirosyan equation for three - body systems @xcite . the efimov effect @xcite in bosonic and fermionic systems was addressed in ref .",
    "an important extension of the approach was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to treat the four - body problem in the presence of the three - body efimov effect , and the process of dimer - dimer scattering was studied in detail in ref .",
    "this shows one of the key strengths of the frg method , which is its universality . with relatively minor changes",
    "it can be adopted to study a large variety of problems in particle , nuclear and condensed matter physics .",
    "some representative examples can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    up to now ,",
    "most applications of the frg have been to particle physics and condensed matter systems . in the present work",
    "we apply it to systems of up to four nucleons , laying the groundwork for extensions to larger numbers of nucleons and to nuclear matter .",
    "one important aspect of our implementation of the frg is the introduction of bosonic fields to describe interacting pairs of nucleons",
    ". this will be very useful for future work since it will allow us to link the scattering of nucleons in vacuum to pairing in systems of many nucleons , as in ref .",
    "this study of few - nucleon systems allows us to develop some of the tools and determine the parameters that will be needed in such work . in this context , it is helpful to make use of wigner s su(4 )  supermultiplet \" symmetry , which is known to be a very good approximate symmetry for light nuclei @xcite , and even for some two - nucleon processes , provided the momenta involved are large compared with the inverse scattering lengths @xcite .",
    "the effective action is the legendre transform of the logarithm of the partition function , @xmath4=w[j]-j\\cdot    \\phi_c$ ] , where @xmath5 is the partition function in the presence of an external source @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the functional @xmath7 is the generator of the one - particle - irreducible green s functions , and it reduces to the usual effective potential for homogeneous systems .",
    "one of the reasons to work with @xmath7 rather than @xmath8 is that we can introduce a renormalisation group flow to determine @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "a running version of the effective action is defined by introducing an artificial gap in the energy spectrum for the fields which depends on a momentum scale @xmath2 .",
    "thus we define a different effective action for each @xmath2 by integrating over components of the fields with momenta @xmath9 only .",
    "the rg trajectory then interpolates between the classical action of the underlying field theory ( at large @xmath2 ) , and the full effective action ( at zero @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "the intermediate actions along the trajectory are not physically meaningful .",
    "the flow equation for the effective action is a functional differential equation of the form @xmath10.\\label{eq : evolution}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 denotes the second functional derivative taken with respect to the fields entering the action , and @xmath12 is a matrix of cut - off functions .",
    "these functions act as regulators , suppressing the contributions of fluctuations with momenta below the running scale @xmath2 , and thus driving the evolution of the system as @xmath2 is lowered .",
    "the structure of the evolution equation is rather straightforward , the main complexity is in the operation @xmath13 , which is the supertrace , which is taken over both energy - momentum variables and internal indices . it is needed since we consider a mixed system of fermions ( nucleons ) and bosonic dimers in this work .",
    "the main advantage of this version of the rg is that the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) involves a single integral over energy and momentum .",
    "it thus has the form of a one - loop integral , where @xmath14 can be thought of as the matrix of single - particle propagators dressed by all fluctuations above the scale @xmath2 . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) is exact and therefore nonperturbative , questions of diagrammatic expansion do not arise in this framework , in contrast to other versions of the rg and many traditional approaches to many - body physics . nonetheless , despite its simple structure",
    ", this equation describes the running of a complicated object ",
    "@xmath7 is in general a non - local functional of all the fields describing our system .",
    "since exact solution of a functional differential equation is usually not possible , in practical applications , the rea is usually truncated to a finite number of local terms .",
    "the choice of these is guided by the relevant physics in the system we wish to describe , and by insights from effective field theories .",
    "this truncation reduces the full functional differential equation ( [ eq : evolution ] ) to a set of coupled ode s for the running coupling constants and renormalisation factors multiplying those terms in the action .",
    "these equations are straightforward to solve nonperturbatively using standard methods .",
    "it is the choice of the physics we want to describe that determines the form of the expansion of the rea .",
    "the use of local interactions means that the frg method has close links to approaches based on effective field theories @xcite . in some cases , for example the action used to study the efimov effect in three - boson systems , the terms included are just the leading terms of the corresponding effective field theory . in other cases , such as the applications to dense matter ,",
    "strict power counting arguments can not be used and we must rely on the need to describe emergent aspects of the physics that are known to be important , such as superfluidity .    in the limit where @xmath2 is much larger that all the physical scales in our system , @xmath2 becomes the only important scale .",
    "the effects of the physical scales , for example the scattering lengths , become negligible in this regime and the evolution equations then show scaling behaviour with @xmath2 .",
    "this behaviour is governed by the unitary limit , where the inverse two - body scattering lengths vanish . in this limit ,",
    "all of the evolution equations collapse to simple universal forms for large enough values of the cut - off scale @xmath2 . moreover , since all the inverse scattering lengths are negligible , these equations have su(4)-symmetric forms .",
    "these universal equations can then be used to obtain boundary conditions for the evolution equations away from the unitary limit .",
    "we present the detailed form of these equations in the appendix , where we show that they form two decoupled sets of equations .",
    "the set of equations that describes three or four particles in spatially symmetric states displays the efimov effect @xcite .",
    "in these channels , scale invariance is broken by the appearance of an infinite tower of three - body bound states , with subsequent energies in a constant ratio .",
    "a single three - body initial condition needs to be specified to fix the energies of all these states .",
    "in the main body of the paper we derive a general set of equations for the evolution of the rea , without assuming su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "nonetheless , this symmetry plays a pivotal role in our approach .",
    "as just mentioned , the initial conditions are imposed at a scale where su(4 ) is a very good symmetry .",
    "initially the evolution remains in this regime , and it is only when it reaches scales @xmath15 that su(4)-breaking effects can become large . in the two body sector",
    ", the symmetry is lost in the physical limit ( @xmath16 ) for quantities like the scattering lengths themselves .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , su(4 ) remains a good approximate symmetry for three- and four - body scattering at threshold .",
    "working with the same combinations of couplings that decouple in the su(4 ) limit , we find that the mixing remains small , except in narrow regions of the three - body parameter that controls the positions of the efimov states .",
    "one of these sets describes the channels where the nucleons are in states of mixed spatial symmetry and it has the same form as that for a system of fermions with spin degrees of freedom only , as derived in ref .",
    "the other set describes the spatially symmetric channels and , after a suitable redefinition of coupling constants , it matches the evolution equations for a system of interacting bosons in ref .",
    "despite the similar forms of the two sets of equations , the differences in their numerical coefficients have profound physical consequences .",
    "in particular , the equations for spatially symmetric systems leads to the efimov effect @xcite and limit - cycle behaviour of the 3-body couplings @xcite .",
    "in contrast these effects do not occur for few - fermion systems without spatial symmetry .",
    "in the next section we set out the form of the rea we use in our applications of the frg to few - nucleon systems , and in sec .",
    "iii we obtain the evolution equations for the running parameters in that action .",
    "then , in section iv , we apply these to analyse scattering in three- and four - nucleon systems for realistic @xmath17 scattering lengths .",
    "we compare our results to those in the su(4 ) limit , details of which can be found in appendix a. finally , some technical details of the link between scattering lengths and rea are discussed in appendix b.",
    "since our ultimate goal is to study pairing in dense nuclear matter , we must isolate the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "as is well known , the nuclear force is just strong enough to generate a bound state , the deuteron , in one of the @xmath18-wave channels .",
    "its isospin-1 analogue is only just unbound and appears as a virtual state very close to threshold .",
    "we thus find it useful to introduce boson fields to describe the lowest two - body states in both these channels .",
    "if one imagines starting from an effective action with a local two - body interaction between the fermions , the boson fields can be introduced using a hubbard - stratonovitch transformation , which is exact in this case .",
    "we use the notation @xmath19 for the ( spin - triplet ) vector - isoscalar boson field , corresponding to the deuteron , and @xmath20 for the ( spin - singlet ) scalar - isovector one .",
    "these we refer to collectively as `` dimers '' , and label by a capital @xmath21 .",
    "we reserve the lower - case label @xmath22 for a deuteron , and @xmath23 for a generic nucleon . finally , when specifying quantum numbers of particular channels , we use the @xmath24 notation @xmath25 , where @xmath18 and @xmath26 denote the resultant spin and isospin quantum numbers , respectively . in the present work",
    ", we assume that isospin is a good symmetry .",
    "the use of such dibaryon fields was first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of effective field theories . the key approximation we make is to truncate the full rea to one with only a finite number of parameters , so that the functional differential equation can be replaced by a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "no further approximations are made , which means that the solution of the resulting equations is nonperturbative in all their couplings . in the present case",
    ", we introduce a set of local contact interactions in the channels of interest , as well as kinetic terms for the dimer fields . in principle",
    "we could also have added effective ranges for the interactions using the forms used in effective field theory ; in this first application we have not included such effects .",
    "the form for the rea we use is @xmath27 since the action at the start of the evolution is obtained by bosonising a purely fermionic one , the boson fields should be non - propagating auxiliary fields for @xmath28 .",
    "their wave function and kinetic - mass renormalisation factors ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) should tend to zero in this limit .",
    "when we run the action as we lower the cut - off scale @xmath2 , these fields become dynamical , and the renormalisation factors grow .",
    "the bosonisation introduces self - energies for the boson fields ( @xmath31 ) and couplings of the dimers to pairs of nucleons in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 two - body channels .",
    "these couplings are described by the term,@xmath34^{(1,0)}+\\text{h.c.}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}g_{\\isum}\\left[{\\boldsymbol{\\ib}}^{\\dagger}(p_{30},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{3})\\cdot\\left[\\psi(p_{10},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{1})\\psi^{c}(p_{20},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{2})\\right]^{(0,1)}+\\text{h.c.}\\right],\\label{eq : v2dn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 since @xmath36 is a @xmath32 tensor and @xmath37 a @xmath33 one , the scalar products in eq .",
    "( [ eq : v2dn ] ) should be understood as being taken in either spin or isospin space , as appropriate .",
    "the values of the coupling constants @xmath38 depend on a choice of scale in the dimer fields when they are introduced by the hubbard - stratonovitch transformation .",
    "thus we must find that the values of the @xmath38 do not appear separately in physical quantities , but only in combinations such as @xmath39 .",
    "an illustration of this is provided by the discussion of the evolution of the @xmath31 in the next section .",
    "the unobservable coupling constants @xmath38 do not run in vacuum and , for simplicity , we choose their values to be equal , @xmath40    to describe the three - nucleon channels , we introduce a set of local dimer - nucleon interactions , described by the term @xmath41^{(1/2,1/2)}\\cdot\\left[\\psi(p_{20},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{2})j(p_{40},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{4})\\right]^{(1/2,1/2)}\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\quad+\\lambdath_{\\vsum\\vsum}\\left[\\vb^{\\dagger}(p_{30},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{3})\\psi^{\\dagger}(p_{10},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{1})\\right]^{(3/2,1/2)}\\cdot\\left[\\psi(p_{20},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{2})\\vb(p_{40},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{4})\\right]^{(3/2,1/2)}\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\quad+\\lambdaht_{\\isum\\isum}\\left[\\ib^{\\dagger}(p_{30},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{3})\\psi^{\\dagger}(p_{10},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{1})\\right]^{(1/2,3/2)}\\cdot\\left[\\psi(p_{20},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{2})\\ib(p_{40},{\\boldsymbol{p}}_{4})\\right]^{(1/2,3/2)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",

    "the @xmath43 channel has the quantum numbers of the ground states of @xmath46h and @xmath46he .",
    "finally , we introduce one class of four - nucleon interactions , represented by local two - body dimer - dimer interactions and described by the term @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49 terms act in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 two - dimer ( four - nucleon ) channels , the @xmath52 terms act in the @xmath53 channel , and the @xmath54 terms act in the @xmath55 channel .",
    "only the last of these has the quantum numbers of the ground state of the @xmath56 particle .",
    "the behaviour for large @xmath2 is particularly simple . in this region",
    ", the regulator provides the only scale and every coupling varies as a power of @xmath2 .",
    "the effects of su(4)-breaking also become negligible here and so the evolution equations reduce to the simpler , su(4)-symmetric forms discussed in appendix a. this allows us to determine the initial conditions on the evolution here and these then provide the physical input into our approach .",
    "most of the parameters are  irrelevant \" in the technical sense that the low - energy results from our action in the physical limit ( @xmath57 ) do not depend strongly on the precise values of the initial conditions imposed at very large @xmath2",
    ". however , there are three exceptions and these provide the physical input into our approach .",
    "two of them are the self - energies , @xmath31 , which are  relevant \" parameters in rg language , as discussed in ref .",
    "their values at @xmath58 determine the strength of the interaction between the fermions and can be related either to the @xmath17 scattering lengths , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , or , in the channel with the bound state , to the deuteron binding energy , @xmath61    the third parameter is associated with the spatially - symmetric channel of the three - nucleon system .",
    "this is the channel that displays the efimov effect @xcite and as a result the evolution of its coupling constant for it has a limit - cycle behaviour at large-@xmath2 .",
    "just as in the analogous eft treatment @xcite , one piece of three - body data is needed to fix the starting point on this cycle . here",
    "we choose the nucleon - deuteron scattering length in the spin - doublet channel , and explore how four - nucleon observables are related to it .",
    "to derive the evolution equations for the coupling constants in our action , we substitute the parametrisation given in the previous section into the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolution ] ) .",
    "the inverse of the second derivative of @xmath7 forms a scale - dependent propagator , and the driving terms for the coupling constants all have structure of one - loop integrals , with differing numbers of external fields . in general",
    "these include expressions with powers of fields or derivatives beyond those contained in our truncated action .",
    "we therefore need to expand the loop integrals in powers of the fields and non - localities ( i.e. , in energies and momenta ) and pick out those terms that match the structures listed in the previous section .",
    "the scale - dependent coefficient in front of each structure then gives us the driving term in the differential equation for the corresponding coupling constant .    as well as the choice of truncation",
    ", we also need to make a choice of the point around which we expand our energies . since we concentrate on the physics at the dimer threshold , we choose our expansion points for this state ; other choices are possible , but suffer from numerical complications arising from linking the flows both above and below threshold . for the dimers ,",
    "we choose the energy of the lowest two - body bound state , @xmath62 . in the four - nucleon sector , for example , this means that we expand around the deuteron - deuteron threshold .",
    "for the nucleons we expand around one half of this binding energy . thus in the nuclear - dimer channels of the the three - nucleon system we expand about an energy @xmath63 below the the scattering threshold .",
    "this procedure can be justified rigorously in the limit of exact su(4 ) symmetry , as discussed further below , but it is only approximate in the general case .",
    "it could thus lead to a slower convergence than expected of the expansion .    finally , we need to choose the forms for the cut - off functions in the regulators for the nucleons and dimers . here",
    "we take the form suggested by litim @xcite for both , as it is well - suited for partially analytic calculations .",
    "it is also optimised for actions truncated to purely local ( energy - independent ) interactions , as also discussed in more detail by pawlowski @xcite .",
    "the regulators are thus given by @xmath64 note that we have assumed that the two @xmath65 s are equal ; this can be shown to hold in the expansion scheme we use here , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : zphi ] ) below .",
    "the inclusion of the wave - function renormalisation factor in the definition of @xmath66 has the advantage of allowing us to scale out the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , leaving much simpler , dimensionless expressions .",
    "for example , a generic three - body coupling @xmath70 has a natural scaling of the form @xmath71 analogously a generic four - body coupling @xmath72 can be scaled as @xmath73      the evolution equations for @xmath31 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are relatively straightforward in vacuum .",
    "their forms are the same as in the simpler case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for example , both the @xmath31 satisfy the differential equation @xmath74 where @xmath62 appears in the denominator as a result of our choice of expansion point and we have already performed the integral over the virtual energy @xmath75 . this equation is an exact differential and can be integrated directly .",
    "its solution grows linearly with @xmath2 as @xmath28 , reflecting the relevant nature of the parameters @xmath31 .",

    "provided that these states are more deeply bound than the deuteron , as they are in the real world , this scale is large compared to the inverse scattering lengths , and su(4 ) remains a good approximate symmetry .",
