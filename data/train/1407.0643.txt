    "in a _ network creation game _ ( ncg ) , we are given @xmath0 players identified as the nodes of a graph , and each player attempts to connect itself to all the other players .",
    "in such a decentralized process , each player aims to selfishly optimize a certain _ routing _",
    "cost towards the other players .",
    "thus , its action consists of choosing a suitable subset of players , which are then made adjacent through the activation of the corresponding set of incident edges .",
    "unavoidably , activating a link incurs a cost to the player , and so the overall _ building _",
    "cost should be strategically balanced with the aforementioned routing cost .    due to their generality , it is in clear evidence that ncgs can model very different practical situations , depending on how all the build - up ingredients are mixed . in the very classic formulation of the game @xcite , each player has no limitations in choosing a subset of adjacent players , its routing cost is a function of the sum of distances to all the other players ( i.e. , the so called _ sum cost _ ) , and activating a link has a fixed cost @xmath14 . not surprisingly , this model was devised by the economists , which were mainly interested in understanding whether the attainment of an equilibrium status ( i.e. , a status in which players are not willing to move from ) for a mutual - relationships social system is compatible with the behavior of the players , which tend to establish selfishly their personal contacts .    with the recent advent of the algorithmic game theory , the interest on ncgs has been reawakened .",
    "this is especially due to the fact that ncgs are fit to model the decentralized construction of _ communication _ networks , in which the constituting components ( e.g. , routers and links ) are activated and maintained by different owners , as in the internet .",
    "according to its performance measurement philosophy , computer scientists put a new special emphasis on the challenge of understanding how the social utility for the ( very large ) system as a whole is affected by the selfish behavior of the players .",
    "this trend originated from the paper of fabrikant _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and was then followed by a sequel of papers , as detailed in the following .    [ [ previous - work . ] ] previous work .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as said before , the canonical form of a ncg , also known as sumncg , is as follows : we are given a set of @xmath0 players , say @xmath15 , where the strategy space of player @xmath16 is the power set @xmath17 .",
    "given a combination of strategies @xmath18 , let @xmath19 denote the underlying undirected graph whose node set is @xmath15 , and whose edge set is @xmath20 .",
    "then , the _ cost _ incurred by player @xmath21 under @xmath22 is    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the distance between nodes @xmath25 and @xmath21 in @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the cost function implements the inherently antagonistic goals of a player , which on one hand attempts to buy as little edges as possible , and on the other hand aims to be as close as possible to the other nodes in the resulting network .",
    "these two criteria are suitably balanced in ( [ cost ] ) by making use of the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the _ _ nash equilibria _ _ ( ne ) space of the game is a function of it .",
    "actually , if we characterize such a space in terms of the _ price of anarchy _ ( poa ) , then this has been shown to be constant for all values of @xmath5 except for @xmath26 , for any @xmath27 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a first natural variant of sumncg was introduced in @xcite , where the authors redefined the player cost function as follows    @xmath28    this variant , named maxncg , received further attention in @xcite , where the authors improved the poa of the game on the whole range of values of @xmath5 , obtaining in this case that the poa is constant for all values of @xmath5 except for @xmath29 .    besides these two basic models , many variations on the theme have been defined . in an effort of defining @xmath5-free models , in @xcite the authors proposed a variant in which a player , when forming the network , has a limited budget to establish links to other players .",
    "this way , the player cost function will only describe the goal of the player , namely either the maximum distance or the total distance to other nodes . since in @xcite links and hence the resulting graph are seen as directed , a natural variant of the model was given in @xcite , where the undirected case was considered .",
    "afterwards , in @xcite the authors proposed a model complementing the one given in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they assumed that the cost function of each player now only consists of the number of bought edges ( without any budget on them ) , and a player needs to connect to the network by satisfying the additional constraint of staying within a given either maximum or total distance to the rest of players .",
    "then , in @xcite the authors proposed a further variant , called basicncg , in which given some existing network , the only improving transformations allowed are _ edge swap _ ,",
    "i.e. , a player can only modify a _ single _ incident edge , by either replacing it with a new incident edge , or by removing it .",
    "recently , this model has been extended to the case in which edges are oriented and players can swap only outleading edges @xcite .",
    "notice that , differently from the previous models , the problem of computing a best - response strategy of a player in basicncg is _ not _ -hard .",
    "this inspired a subsequent model @xcite in which a player can swap , add , or delete a single edge . here",
    "the best response strategy is still computable in polynomial time while the player has more freedom to act .",
    "generally speaking , in all the above models the obtained results on the poa are asymptotically worse than those we get in the two basic models , and we refer the reader to the cited papers for the actual bounds .    [",
    "[ our - results . ] ] our results .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we concentrate on a seemingly underplayed generalization of ncgs , namely that in which for each player the set of possible adjacent nodes is constrained by a given connected , undirected graph @xmath30 , which in the end will host the created network .",
    "this finds its practical motivations in the physical limitations of constructing links , and was originally studied in @xcite for sumncg , where it is shown that the poa is upper bounded by @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath10 , respectively , and lower bounded by @xmath34 . here , we focus on the max - distance version , that we call maxncg@xmath35 , and we show that also in this case the poa is fairly bad , ) as it was done in @xcite , in order to incentivize the players to converge to connected equilibria . alternatively ,",
    "this can be obtained by assuming that initially the players sit on a connected network ( embedded in the host graph ) , and they move ( non - simultaneously ) with a myopic best / improving response dynamics . ] even when the host graph is restricted to some basic standard layout patterns .",
    "more precisely , we show that the poa is @xmath36 for the classes of @xmath6-regular ( with any constant @xmath7 ) and 2-dimensional grid host graphs .",
    "this lower bound is asymptotically tight for @xmath9 , since we can prove a general upper bound of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the radius of @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , on general host graphs , we exhibit a lower bound of @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "quite surprisingly , this implies that the poa is @xmath4 even when the players can build edges for free . on the positive side ,",
    "if @xmath10 , we show the poa is at most 2 ( this is a direct consequence of the fact that in this case any equilibrium is a tree ) .",
    "finally , in the meaningful practical case in which the host graph is sparse ( i.e. , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 ) , we prove that the poa is @xmath43 , and so for very sparse graphs , i.e. @xmath44 , we obtain that the poa is constant .    preliminarily to the above study , we also provide some results concerning the computational and dynamic aspects of the game .",
    "first , we prove that computing a best response for a player is -hard for any @xmath45 , thus extending a similar result given in @xcite for maxncg when @xmath46 .",
    "then , we prove that maxncg@xmath35 is not a potential game , by showing that an improving response dynamic does not guarantee to converge to an equilibrium , even if we assume a minimal _ liveness _ property that no player is prevented from moving for arbitrarily many steps .",
    "this implies that an improving response dynamic may not converge for the maxncg game as well ( after relaxing such a liveness property ) .",
    "a deeper discussion on dynamics in ncgs can be found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we analyze the computational / convergence aspects of the game , while sections 3 and 4 discuss the upper and lower bounds to the poa , respectively .",
    "first of all , we observe that , as for the sum - distance version of the problem studied in @xcite , it is open to establish whether maxncg@xmath35 always admits an equilibrium .",
    "this problem is particularly intriguing , since the topology of @xmath30 could play a discriminating role on that .",
    "we conjecture an affirmative answer to this question for any @xmath47 ( for @xmath48 it is trivially true as any strategy profile @xmath22 such that @xmath49 is a ne ) . as a first step towards this direction , observe that given any @xmath30 , a breadth - first search tree rooted at a center of @xmath30 , and in which each node owns the edges towards its children , is an equilibrium whenever @xmath50 , where @xmath38 is the radius of @xmath30 . indeed ,",
    "notice that each vertex @xmath25 has no unactivated edges towards the vertices of its subtrees .",
    "this immediately implies that @xmath25 can not improve its cost by changing to a strategy having at most the same number of bought edges .",
    "moreover , in any other strategy , @xmath25 must incur a cost of at least @xmath51 to buy some additional edges while its routing cost , which is actually less than or equal to @xmath52 can not decrease by more than @xmath38 since it can never be less than @xmath38 .",
    "besides that , and similarly to other ncgs , we also have the bad news that the problem of computing the best response of player is -hard , as stated in the following theorem .    [",
    "th : best response ] for every constant @xmath53 and for every @xmath45 , the problem of computing a best response strategy of a player is -hard .",
    "the reduction is from the -complete _",
    "3-exact 3-cover _ problem ( 3x3c for short ) which , given ( i ) a set @xmath54 of @xmath55 objects , with @xmath56 , and ( ii ) a set @xmath57 of subsets of @xmath54 each having cardinality equal to 3 and such that every @xmath58 is a member of at most three sets in @xmath57 , asks for determining whether there exists a subset @xmath59 of cardinality equal to @xmath6 that covers @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "the reduction is the following .",
    "let @xmath61 .",
    "for a given instance of the 3x3c problem with @xmath55 objects we build a host graph @xmath30 having @xmath62 vertices .",
    "more precisely , @xmath30 contains an object vertex @xmath63 for every object @xmath64 , and a set vertex @xmath65 for every @xmath66 . for every set @xmath66 and for every @xmath64",
    ", @xmath30 contains a path of length @xmath67 having @xmath63 and @xmath65 as endpoints iff @xmath68 .",
    "all paths are vertex - disjoint except for at most their endpoints .",
    "finally , @xmath30 contains an additional path @xmath69 of length @xmath70 which is vertex - disjoint w.r.t .",
    "all the other paths , and an additional vertex @xmath71 linked to all the set vertices and to one endpoint of @xmath69 , that we denote by @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath22 be any strategy profile such that @xmath19 contains all edges of @xmath30 except those incident to @xmath71 .",
    "we claim that any best response strategy of player @xmath71 has cost equal to @xmath73 iff @xmath57 contains a subset of cardinality @xmath6 that covers @xmath54 .    to prove one direction , observe that if @xmath59 has size @xmath6 and covers @xmath54 , then , by buying the edge towards @xmath72 and all the @xmath6 edges @xmath74 for every @xmath75 , @xmath71 would incur a cost equal to @xmath76 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that each vertex of @xmath77 which is neither @xmath71 nor a vertex in @xmath69 is at distance of at most @xmath67 from some object vertex . furthermore , each object vertex is at distance of at most @xmath67 from some set vertex @xmath65 such that @xmath75 .    to prove the other direction ,",
    "let @xmath78 be the strategy profile obtained from @xmath22 by changing @xmath71 s strategy with one of its best response strategies and assume that @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath80 be the subset of @xmath57 containing set @xmath81 iff @xmath71 is buying the edge towards @xmath65 in @xmath78 .",
    "first of all , observe that if @xmath80 does not cover @xmath54 , or @xmath71 has not bought the edge towards @xmath72 , then the routing cost of @xmath71 is greater than or equal to @xmath82 .",
    "consequently , @xmath71 has bought the edge towards @xmath72 and @xmath80 covers @xmath54 . therefore @xmath83 . as the distance from @xmath71 to the endpoint of @xmath69 different from @xmath72",
    "is @xmath84 , and since @xmath85 , it follows that @xmath86 .",
    "notice that the result stated in theorem [ th : best response ] holds for any @xmath45 , and so this extends the -hardness proof given in @xcite which holds for complete host graphs and @xmath46 .",
    "we now discuss a negative result about the convergence of the improving response dynamics . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this is the first result showing that an improving response dynamics on maxncg might not converge to an equilibrium .",
    "a deeper discussion about dynamics in ncgs can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ thm : lb_poa ] for every value of @xmath87 , maxncg@xmath35 is not a potential game .",
    "moreover , if @xmath88 , an improving response dynamics may not converge to an equilibrium .",
    "we prove the non existence of a potential function by showing a cyclic sequence of strategy profiles where , at the end of each cycle , the total cost of the moving players has decreased by a positive constant .",
    "let @xmath89 be an integer satisfying @xmath90 and consider a host graph @xmath30 similar to the one shown in figure [ fig : not_potential ] .",
    "@xmath30 is composed by a cycle of @xmath91 nodes labelled from @xmath92 to @xmath91 , by a path of @xmath93 edges having @xmath71 and @xmath72 as endpoints , and by all the edges between @xmath71 and the nodes of the cycle . the strategy profile @xmath94 being played is shown by using a graphical notation explained in the caption .    .",
    "on the left side , the initial configuration , where directed edges exit from their respective owner node , dashed edges are non - bought edges of @xmath30 , and the spline denotes a path between @xmath72 and @xmath71 , whose edges are arbitrarily owned . ]    in such a status , player @xmath92 is paying @xmath95 , whilst changing the strategy to @xmath96 by removing the edge @xmath97 yields a cost of @xmath98 , thus saving @xmath5 .",
    "observe that now @xmath99 is @xmath100 , and so @xmath71 has interest in swapping the edge @xmath101 with the edge @xmath102 , thus obtaining the strategy @xmath103 and saving @xmath92 .",
    "in such configuration @xmath104 has increased to @xmath105 , therefore player @xmath92 can buy back the edge @xmath97 , as shown in strategy @xmath106 , thus reducing its cost to @xmath107 , i.e. , saving @xmath108 .",
    "notice how configuration @xmath106 is similar to @xmath94 , with the only difference being the edge bought by @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath90 , by repeating @xmath91 times these strategy changes , every node in the cycle @xmath109 will play a move at least once , and the resulting configuration is identical to @xmath94 , hence the players will cycle .    to prove the latter part of the claim it suffices to note that after each cycle : ( i ) for @xmath88 each strategy change is an improving response , and ( ii ) that the nodes in the path from @xmath71 to @xmath72 other than @xmath71 , can never change their strategy .",
    "actually , the above proof shows that the improving response dynamics may not converge even if the minimal liveness property that each player takes a chance to make an improving move every fixed number of steps is guaranteed .",
    "indeed , as observed in the proof , the players sitting on the path appended to @xmath71 do not move just because they can not .",
    "therefore , we can extend the above proof to the case in which @xmath30 is a complete graph if the players sitting on the path appended to @xmath71 can never move .",
    "this shows that the improving response dynamics may not converge on complete host graphs as well , i.e. , for the classic ncg .",
    "in this section we prove some upper bounds to the poa for the game . in what follows , for a generic graph @xmath77 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath110 and @xmath111 its radius and its diameter , respectively , and by @xmath112 the eccentricity of node @xmath21 in @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath113 the _ social cost _ of a generic strategy profile @xmath22 ( i.e. , the sum of players individual costs ) , and by @xmath114 a strategy profile minimizing the social cost . then    [ lm : ub_aux ] let @xmath115 be a ne , and let @xmath116 . then , we have that @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a center of @xmath77 , and let @xmath118 be a shortest path tree of @xmath77 rooted at @xmath25 .",
    "clearly , the diameter of @xmath118 is at most @xmath119 .",
    "now , for every node @xmath21 , let us denote by @xmath120 the number of edges of @xmath118 bought by @xmath21 in @xmath22 .",
    "the key argument is that if a node @xmath21 bought only the @xmath120 edges of @xmath118 , its eccentricity would be at most @xmath121 .",
    "hence , since @xmath22 is a ne , we have that @xmath122 .",
    "by summing up the inequalities over all nodes , we obtain @xmath123 now , since @xmath124 , we have @xmath125    as an immediate consequence , we obtain the following :    for @xmath116 , the @xmath126 is @xmath127 .",
    "another interesting consequence of lemma [ lm : ub_aux ] concerns sparse host graphs :    [ th : sparse host graph ] if the host graph @xmath30 has @xmath128 edges , and @xmath42 , then the @xmath126 is @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath115 be an equilibrium network .",
    "since @xmath77 must be connected , we have that @xmath130 .",
    "this is sufficient to provide an upper bound to the diameter of @xmath77 . indeed , in @xcite it is shown that the diameter of a connected graph obtained from a supergraph of diameter @xmath131 by deleting @xmath132 edges is at most @xmath133 .",
    "this implies that in our case @xmath134 .",
    "now , the claim follows from lemma [ lm : ub_aux ] .",
    "theorem [ th : sparse host graph ] implies that , for very sparse host graphs @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath44 , we have that the poa is @xmath11 , for any @xmath5 .",
    "next theorem shows that the poa is upper bounded by 2 when @xmath5 is at least @xmath0 .",
    "a similar result has already been proved in @xcite for the case in which @xmath30 is a complete graph .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the same proof extends to any host graph @xmath30 .    for @xmath135 , the @xmath126 is at most @xmath136 .",
    "we end this section by showing that when either @xmath5 is small , or the host graph has small diameter , every stable tree ( if any ) is a good equilibrium .",
    "this generalizes a result in @xcite given for complete host graphs , which states that the social cost of every acyclic equilibrium is @xmath11 times the optimum .",
    "[ lm : ecc(u)-ecc(v)<=1+a ] let @xmath137 be an edge of the host graph .",
