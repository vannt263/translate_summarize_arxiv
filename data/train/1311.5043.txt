    "in recent years , there has been an increasing interest in dynamical systems given on a finite time interval , driven by applications in geophysical fluid flows , biological models and engineering .",
    "hyperbolic lagrangian coherent structures ( lcss ) , i.e. , codimension - one material surfaces with locally the strongest normal repulsion or attraction @xcite , have been identified as the key structures governing transient pattern formation , transport and mixing@xcite . as such ,",
    "they are considered as finite - time analogues to stable and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic equilibria / trajectories in steady / unsteady flows admitting time - asymptotic solutions .",
    "many approaches to numerical lcs detection have been developed , and most of them identify hyperbolic lcss with ridges in scalar separation measure fields such as finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftles)@xcite , finite - size lyapunov exponents ( fsles)@xcite , relative dispersion@xcite , and finite - time entropy@xcite .    a relation between hyperbolic lcss and the ftle field was first suggested by haller @xcite .",
    "the guiding intuition @xcite was that repelling lcss should be indicated by curves ( or surfaces ) of ( locally ) maximal values  subsumed by an intuitive notion of _ ridges_of some separation measure , computed in forward time .",
    "in contrast , attracting lcss were thought to be indicated by ridges obtained from a backward - time computation .",
    "this intuition has been adopted for the ftle @xcite , and is also present in the majority of approaches based on ridges of separation measures .    in this article , we show that in the two - dimensional incompressible case , strongly _ attracting _ structures necessarily induce strong particle separation and are hence indicated by forward ftle ridges .",
    "this is in contradiction to the wide - spread hypothesis that any forward ftle ridge corresponds to a repelling flow structure .",
    "there are several conceptual and computational issues related to that hypothesis @xcite , including an example of an ftle ridge induced by strong shear . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the phenomenon of normally attracting forward ftle ridges has been unknown and adds another aspect of mathematical inconsistency to purely ridge - based lcs approaches .",
    "after all , ftle ridges may be induced by all sorts of dynamical phenomena , ranging from normal attraction via shear to normal repulsion .",
    "our example raises the question of how to determine attracting lcss in a forward finite - time lyapunov analysis .",
    "this question has been first considered in the context of the geodesic approach to hyperbolic lcss@xcite . as we show in this work ,",
    "one possible solution is to include principal directions in the lcs approach , as provided by the variational theory @xcite and the more recent geodesic theory of lcss @xcite .    in , we extend recent results on the relation between forward and backward ftles@xcite to both the whole finite - time lyapunov spectrum and to associated principal directions .",
    "we develop the theory in the setting of riemannian manifolds , which was first considered in ref .   and",
    "is of interest in large - scale geophysical fluid flow applications .",
    "our analysis strongly benefits from considering the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the deformation gradient tensor .",
    "remarkably , even though the svd is a well - established tool for the computation of lyapunov spectra and lyapunov vectors of time - asymptotic dynamical systems @xcite , its use in the finite - time context has been limited mostly to an alternative computation tool of the ftle .",
    "our analysis , however , also includes fields of subdominant singular values and singular vectors .",
    "this turns out to be of significant theoretical and computational advantage@xcite .",
    "is devoted to the characterization of attracting lcss in the geodesic @xcite and the variational @xcite sense in forward time . in the first case",
    ", we provide a short and direct geometric proof of the main result of ref .  .",
    "in the latter , the characterization is new and reveals that in two - dimensional incompressible flows , variational attracting lcss satisfy ridge - type conditions for the forward ftle field .",
    "we apply both approaches to the saddle flow discussed in and show that both methods detect repelling and attracting lcss correctly , irrespective of the orientation of a visual ftle ridge .",

    "this is in contradiction to its attracting nature . for a longer integration time of @xmath10",

    "set , however , it may be unclear whether the chosen / available integration time suffices to make the appearance of attracting lcss as ftle ridges unlikely .",
    "this in turn necessitates additional post - processing .    as indicated by this example and later theoretical results ,",
    "defining attracting and repelling lcss as ftle ridges in backward and forward time , respectively , is mathematically inconsistent .",
    "this inconsistency does not restrict to the ftle field as one representative of a separation measure .",
    "the reason is that separation measures do not indicate _ directions _ of stretching , but merely the pure fact of stretching . the orientation of a specified structure with respect to certain directions is defined only after its determination , and obviously can not be obtained from the scalar field a priori .",
    "additionally , in incompressible two - dimensional vector fields repulsion and attraction balance at each point , such that attracting structures come along with strong particle separation and may appear as ridges .    as we show in this work , one way to resolve this observed",
    "inconsistency is to consider directional information in lcs theory and computations .",
    "in this section , we study finite - time flows on riemannian manifolds .",
    "thereby , we adopt the manifold framework of ref .  , where aspects related to the computation of the scalar ftle field on non - euclidean manifolds are discussed .",
    "we keep our presentation coordinate - free , and recall coordinate - representation issues in appendix [ sec : representation ] .",
    "let @xmath20 be an @xmath21-dimensional riemannian manifold , i.e.  a smooth manifold with a ( riemannian ) metric .",
    "we denote the tangent space of @xmath20 at @xmath22 by @xmath23",
    ". the metric gives rise to an inner product , and hence a norm , on each tangent space , and therefore induces a notion of angles between and length of tangent vectors .",

    "note , that we changed the order of indices compared to the usual svd notation for consistency with literature related to finite - time lyapunov analysis , see below .",
    "it is worth recalling that the svd is well - defined in the following sense , see , e.g. , ref .  :",
    "requiring an ordering of the diagonal entries as above makes @xmath52 uniquely defined .",
    "accordingly , an ordering of the normalized singular vectors is induced , which in turn are uniquely defined up to direction if the associated singular value is simple . throughout this work",
    ", we assume the svd of @xmath42 to be well - defined , and restrict , if necessary , our analysis to the open subset of the domain in which this holds true .",
    "this assumption guarantees the existence of two sets of ( locally ) smooth vector fields : the right - singular vector fields on @xmath33 , and the left - singular vector fields on @xmath56 $ ] .",

    "[ rem : svd ] it is more common to introduce the ftle and the principal directions via the _ eigendecomposition _ of @xmath82 than via the svd of @xmath42 ; see refs .   for svd - based approaches with a different focus .",

    "we continue with our previous choice .",

    "[ rem : svd - bw ] in addition to the well - known advantages of svd mentioned in , another  seemingly overlooked ",
    "benefit from introducing deformation terms via the svd of @xmath42 is that we obtain forward _ and _ backward stretch information from a single forward _ or _ backward time flow computation .",
    "this fact has been exploited recently for efficient and accurate lcs computations and tracking@xcite .    as a consequence ,",
    "the backward ftle is @xmath93 which was first obtained in ref .  , and paraphrased there as : the largest backward ftle equals the negative of the _ smallest _ forward ftle @xmath94 . for two - dimensional incompressible flows , we re - derive prop .  2 in ref .   from eq",
    ", i.e. , @xmath95    even though eq .   has been derived earlier@xcite , a significant implication for visual ftle ridge - based lcs approaches has been overlooked . for simplicity , suppose we identify a visual backward ftle ridge @xmath96 at the final time , which is backward normally repelling .",
    "that is , @xmath96 is characterized by high @xmath97-values relative to neighboring points off @xmath96 .",
    "its flow - preimage @xmath98 at the initial time is a forward attracting lcs with high @xmath17-values relative to neighboring points off @xmath99 , and thus appears as a visual forward ftle ridge .",
    "due to backward normal repulsion , @xmath96 is backward tangentially shrinking , and consequently @xmath99 may have a length on the scale of  or possibly below  computational resolution .",
    "therefore , in practice the likeliness for a visually observable , attracting ftle ridge depends on the ratio between the strength of hyperbolicity , the length of the ftle ridge and the length of integration time . in any case , this does not affect the very fact that strongly forward attracting flow structures come along with high forward ftle values , as demonstrated in .",
    "for most lcs approaches based on particle separation there are no explicit characterizations of attracting lcss in forward time . in this section ,",
    "we provide a short and direct proof of such a characterization for the geodesic approach@xcite , and the new corresponding result for the variational approach@xcite .",

    "for the full variational lcs definition , red / green lines shown here must be orthogonal to green / red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlin_saddle_geo ] .",
    "therefore , the two vertical red lines should be discarded . ]",
    "in this article , we showed that defining attracting and repelling lcss as the ridges of scalar separation measure fields , computed in backward and forward time , respectively , is mathematically inconsistent .",
    "this adds to a collection of previously discovered issues in ftle ridge - based lcs detection @xcite .",
    "the reason for that inconsistency is the fact that separation measures reflect separation in an undirected fashion .",
    "the question , whether or not a certain structure of interest , such as a ridge , aligns with a certain direction field , can be answered only after the computation of the separation measure field and after the selection of the structure . in two - dimensional volume - preserving flows ,",
    "the pointwise balance of particle separation and compression complicates the situation further . in this case , normally attracting material lines come along with large particle separation and may appear as ridges in separation measure fields .",
    "this conceptual issue can not be resolved by refinements in ridge notions , more accurate computations of separation measure fields , or improvements in numerical ridge extraction , but only by more involved lcs concepts .",
    "a natural extension of purely ridge - based lcs approaches is to incorporate principal directions in order to get a self - consistent notion of hyperbolic lcss . in",
    "the recently developed geodesic approach @xcite , the principal direction fields are used to first define candidate structures . only in a second step those structures",
    "are selected , which have the locally strongest intended dynamical impact . this way ,",
    "normal repulsion and normal attraction are guaranteed from the beginning , while the second step guarantees the relevance for explaining finite - time pattern formation and transport .",
    "i would like to thank george haller for support and helpful comments .",
    "furthermore , i am grateful to dan blazevski , florian huhn , and especially simon eugster for fruitful discussions , to joseph lydon for proofreading the manuscript and to mohammad farazmand for sharing his strainline integration code .",
    "i am also thankful to clancy rowley for pointing out ref .  .",
    "in this section , we recall how to derive the metric representation of the deformation gradient , when @xmath20 is embedded in , say , euclidean three - space , and the metric on @xmath20 is pulled back from that ambient space . as an example , we consider the two - dimensional sphere parametrized by geographical coordinates .",
    "textbook references on the subject include refs .  , see also ref .   for aspects on deformation gradient estimation on triangulated manifolds .",
    "let @xmath164 be some @xmath21-dimensional euclidean vector space , and @xmath165 a basis .",
    "then the matrix @xmath166 , @xmath167 , called the _ gramian _ , is the _ metric representing matrix _ , which means the following .",
    "let @xmath168 and @xmath169 the unique representation of @xmath170 w.r.t .",
    "the basis @xmath171 .",
    "then the @xmath21-tuple @xmath172 is the _ coordinate representation _ of @xmath170 w.r.t .",
    "let @xmath173 with coordinate representations @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "then the inner product of @xmath170 and @xmath176 is given by @xmath177 where the right - hand side is meant in terms of the usual matrix - multiplication .",
    "note that the left - hand side is defined independently from any basis , but the right - hand side gives a recipe how to actually compute the inner product in coordinates .",
    "the transformation given by the square root @xmath178 of @xmath179 yields a basis @xmath180 , @xmath181 , in which the inner product can be calculated in euclidean fashion ( recall that if a symmetric , ( semi-)positive definite operator @xmath182 is given as @xmath183 , then the square root of @xmath182 is also referred to as the _ modulus of @xmath184 _ , and denoted by @xmath185 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath186 because of eq .",
    ", we refer to @xmath178 as the _ coordinate transformation to metric coordinates_.      for convenience , we consider in the following exclusively @xmath187 , i.e. , the euclidean three - space with canonical inner product .",
    "we parametrize @xmath188 by the canonical embedding @xmath189 , and we refer to the three coordinate directions as @xmath190 . in these coordinates , the riemannian metric is represented by @xmath191 or , in other words , the metric representing matrix w.r.t .",
    "the canonical orthonormal dual basis @xmath192 is the identity matrix @xmath193 at each point .",
    "let @xmath20 be an embedded submanifold of @xmath188 , and assume for simplicity that ( almost all of ) @xmath20 can be described by a single parametrization @xmath194 , @xmath195 .",
    "examples include the two - dimensional sphere @xmath196 of radius @xmath197 in geographical coordinates , i.e. , _ longitude _ and _ latitude _ , and a three - dimensional spherical shell @xmath198 $ ] , @xmath199 .",
    "for definiteness , we consider only two - dimensional manifolds in the following .    with the parametrization @xmath200 , depending on parameters @xmath201 , and given in terms of @xmath202-coordinates , the pushforward of vector fields in @xmath203-@xmath204-coordinates by @xmath205 , is represented by @xmath206 the pullback @xmath207 of differential forms by @xmath205 ( in the dual @xmath192-@xmath208-coordinates ) , as the dual mapping to the pushforward ,",
    "is then represented by @xmath209 .",
    "we turn @xmath20 into a riemannian manifold , by pulling back the euclidean metric @xmath210 by @xmath205 , i.e.  @xmath211 .",
    "to compute @xmath212 in local coordinates , it suffices to compute the pullbacks of the canonical differential forms , for instance , @xmath213 .",
    "their coordinates correspond to the respective column in the matrix representation of @xmath207 .",
    "a closer inspection of the emerging coefficients reveals that the metric representing matrix of @xmath212 can be computed formally as @xmath214 .",
    "finally , the coordinate transformation to metric coordinates on the tangent space is given by @xmath215 .",
    "let @xmath216\\subseteq\\mathcal{m}$ ] be the flow map as introduced in . consider the velocity field @xmath25 in eq .   to be given in parameters , say , in longitude - latitude on the sphere , and @xmath37 to be computed in parameters as well .",
    "then the jacobian of @xmath42 in these coordinates is computed as @xmath217    by the courant  fischer min ",
    "max theorem@xcite , singular values and vectors of @xmath42 can be characterized as solutions of min - max - problems of @xmath218 i.e. , the deformation effect of @xmath37 at @xmath219 on a tangent vector @xmath220 . as usual , the norm @xmath221 of a tangent vector @xmath222 is given by @xmath223 .",
    "the question now is to which matrix representation to apply an ` svd`-routine .",
    "to this end , we transform the tangent vectors in eq .   to metric coordinates , which yields : @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the euclidean norm of tuples . for the second identity",
    ", we substituted @xmath226 , or , equivalently , @xmath227 .",
    "states that @xmath228 is the metric representation of the deformation gradient . this can be used as input for an ` svd`-routine . finally , right- and",
    "left - singular vectors thus obtained need to be transformed to natural coordinates by @xmath229 and @xmath230 , respectively .",
    "after this step , they can be integrated to obtain strain- and stretchlines in the same parametrization as were given @xmath25 and @xmath37 initially .",
    "consider the two - dimensional sphere of radius @xmath197 , @xmath231 , without the poles , with geographical parametrization given by @xmath232 then the pushforward of vector fields by @xmath205 ( in @xmath233-@xmath204-coordinates ) is represented by @xmath234 thus , the metric representing matrix has the form @xmath235 the diagonal form is a consequence of the orthogonality of the geographical parametrization , the deviation from the identity matrix is due to the lack of normalization .",
    "clearly , the coordinate transformation @xmath215 to metric coordinates in the tangent space is then given by @xmath236 finally , the metric representation of the deformation gradient at @xmath59 , with coordinates @xmath237 , where @xmath238 , with coordinates @xmath239 , takes the form @xmath240    37ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ]  + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty link:\\doibase 10.1063/1.3579597 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1063/1.4800210 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1016/j.physd.2010.11.010 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1016/s0167 - 2789(00)00142 - 1 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1063/pt.3.1886 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1016/s0167 - 2789(00)00199 - 8 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1016/j.physd.2005.10.007 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1063/1.2740025 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1175/1520 - 0469(2002)059 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop `` , ''   ( ) ,   link:\\doibase 10.1016/j.physd.2012.06.010 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1063/1.1403336 [ * * , ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1063/1.1477449 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.5194/npg-17 - 1 - 2010 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1063/1.3690153 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1016/j.physd.2012.05.008 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase    10.1016/j.physd.2012.06.012 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1016/j.physd.2014.03.008 [ * * ,   ( ) ] @noop link:\\doibase 10.1063/1.3278516 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1016/0167 - 2789(87)90076 - 5 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1016/j.physd.2014.01.007 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1063/1.4837075 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1007/bf01262402 [ * * ,   ( ) ] link:\\doibase 10.1007/978 - 3 - 662 - 10388 - 3 [ _ _ ] ,  edited by   ( ,  ) link:\\doibase 10.1007/978 - 1 - 4612 - 1029 - 0 [ _ _ ] ,  ed . ,  , vol .",
