    "the notion of baryon distribution amplitudes ( das ) refers to the valence component of the bethe - salpeter wave function at small transverse separations and is central for the theory of hard exclusive reactions involving baryons  @xcite . as usual for a field theory , extraction of the asymptotic behavior ( in our case for vanishing transverse separation ) introduces divergences that can be studied by the renormalization - group ( rg ) method .",
    "the distribution amplitude @xmath1 thus becomes a function of the three quark momentum fractions @xmath2 and the scale that serves as a uv cutoff in the allowed transverse momenta .",
    "solving the corresponding rg equations in leading logarithmic accuracy  @xcite one is led to the expansion @xmath3 the summation goes over all multiplicatively renormalizable operators built of three quarks and @xmath4 derivatives and @xmath5 is the first coefficient of the beta function .",
    "the polynomials @xmath6 and anomalous dimensions @xmath7 are obtained by diagonalizing the mixing matrix for the three - quark operators @xmath8 and the @xmath9 are the corresponding ( nonperturbative ) matrix elements .",
    "the theory of nucleon das has reached a certain degree of maturity .",
    "in particular the scale dependence is well understood  @xcite and it reveals important symmetries of the quantum theory that are not seen at the level of the qcd lagrangian @xcite . at the same time , they are much less studied as compared to the usual parton distributions .",
    "one reason is that the approach to the perturbative factorization regime in hard reactions appears to be slow .",
    "there is overwhelming evidence that , e.g. , electromagnetic and transition form factors at currently available momentum transfers of the order of a few gev@xmath10 @xcite receive large nonfactorizable contributions from large transverse distances , usually referred to as soft ( feynman ) or end - point contributions , and possibly from higher - twist corrections .",
    "this is indicated , for example , by the fact that the helicity selection rules are strongly violated .",
    "another reason is that nucleon das enter physical observables in a rather complicated way through convolution integrals , integrated with smooth functions of the momentum fractions .",
    "this makes an experimental determination of the das pointwise in @xmath2 very difficult .",
    "a qualitative picture suggested by qcd sum rule calculations is that the valence quark with the spin parallel to that of the proton carries most of its momentum @xcite .",
    "it is timely to make this picture quantitative ; lattice qcd ist best suited for this purpose @xcite , allowing us to evaluate nonperturbative hadronic matrix elements of local operators that enter the expansion in ( [ eq_daexpansion1 ] ) in a fully controllable fashion , at least in principle .    in this work",
    "we report on the calculation of the first few moments of the leading - twist nucleon da and also the normalization of the next - to - leading ( twist - four ) das  @xcite using two dynamical flavors of clover fermions .",
    "the reason why we also consider higher - twist das is that they enter the calculation of the helicity - violating pauli form factor of the nucleon in perturbative qcd  @xcite and also the calculation of the soft ( end - point ) corrections to the form factors in the framework of the light - cone sum rule approach  @xcite .",
    "their knowledge is imperative for a qcd description of exclusive reactions in the jlab energy range .",
    "it turns out that the same matrix elements are responsible for proton decay in grand unified theories ( guts ) , so they are also interesting in a broader physics context . a short presentation of our main results",

    "we focus on the relations to local matrix elements including those that are relevant for proton decay .    in section  [ sec_calc ]",
    "we explain the lattice approach to the calculation of the matrix elements .",
    "the advantages of this method come at the cost of reduced symmetry due to the discretization of space - time .",
    "this leads to additional ( unwanted ) operator mixing as compared to the continuum , which has to be reduced as much as possible by a suitable choice of the operator basis .",
    "in particular , mixing with lower - dimensional operators is dangerous . the theoretical basis for the corresponding analysis is the classification of operators according to irreducible representations of the relevant lattice symmetry group . for quark - antiquark operators",

    "@xcite , while the analogous classification for the three - quark operators needed here is treated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "section  [ sec_results ] is devoted to the presentation of the numerical results for the matrix elements .",
    "we apply two different methods to analyze the data . the first one , which we refer to as unconstrained , is used to determine the normalization constants and to check the consistency of our results for higher moments . in the second method we use the momentum conservation as an additional constraint .",
    "this allows us to improve the accuracy of our results for the higher moments .    in section  [ sec : modelda ] we construct a model for the leading - twist da , presenting our results in form of the canonical expansion eq .",

    "the second disadvantage is the required knowledge of the smeared - smeared nucleon correlator for nonzero spatial momenta , which introduces additional noise .",
