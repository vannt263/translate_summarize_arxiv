    "the study of high and low - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs and lmxbs respectively ) containing neutron stars and black holes in close binary systems is somewhat younger , but also mature ( tanaka & lewin 1995 ) .",
    "the general scenario invoked for the low - mass systems includes evolution through a common envelope phase then subsequent shrinking of the orbit through magnetic braking or emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "when the orbit period becomes short enough , hours to days , even unevolved main sequence companions can fill their roche lobes and transfer mass to the compact primaries .",
    "this scenario has been studied quantitatively with stellar evolution and population synthesis codes .",
    "the close binary orbits imply that tidal forces should lock the secondary stars into rotational synchronism with the orbital period and the implied rotation can be quite rapid .",
    "this synchronization mechanism is efficient for secondaries with convective envelopes .",
    "this rapid rotation may , in turn , induce rotational mixing .",
    "rotational mixing in this context has recently been studied by de mink et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and brott et al .",
    "( 2011a ) in high - mass systems , but most studies of compact binaries with low - mass secondaries have neglected this effect ( e.g. willems & kolb 2004 ; han & podsiadlowski 2004 ; belczynski et al . 2008 ; lipunov et al",

    ".    carbon deficiency may be another symptom of rotationally - induced mixing .",
    "examples of carbon deficient secondaries include the black hole candidate xte  j1118 + 480 , which shows a distinct paucity of carbon since there is no c  iv emission detected ( haswell et al .",

    "harisson , osborne & howell ( 2005 ) presented more cases of cvs with weak co absorption lines in their spectra , implying low c abundance , and suggested that material that has been processed through the cno cycle is finding its way into the photospheres of secondary stars .",

    "ibano et al . ( 2012 ) discuss the carbon deficiency in the mass - accreting primaries of algol systems and attribute it to a carbon deficiency due to cno burning on the lower - mass , mass - losing secondary .",
    "they do not suggest any specific mechanism for the carbon deficiency of the secondary .",
    "extensive discussions of the reasons for carbon depletion in the secondaries of cvs are presented in harrison , osborne , & howell ( 2005 ) and schenker et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . as argued in those works , it is possible to greatly deplete carbon by processing it in the massive stars before roche lobe contact and then stripping off just enough of the outer layers during thermal timescale mass transfer ( ttmt ) to reveal layers depleted in carbon .",
    "the depletion is estimated to be up to a factor of 100 in these models .",
    "this may actually happen in some cvs like ae  aqr since there are other reasons for suspecting the secondary in that system is evolved .",
    "nonetheless , there are two problems invoking the mass - stripping mechanism as the only cause of carbon depletion in some cvs .",
    "first , it could be that a high fraction of cvs show the carbon anomaly .",
    "if so , current population synthesis models can not account for such a high fraction of higher - mass progenitors ( harrison , osborne & howell 2005 ) .",
    "second , the schenker et al .",
    "( 2002 ) mechanism requires fine tuning .",
    "the initial stellar masses , orbital periods , and evolutionary stages need to be exactly right at first roche lobe contact to obtain results that agree with observations .",
    "these issues motivated us to explore the possibility that carbon is depleted by rotationally - induced mixing that processes surface material through the core , where it is subjected to partial cn burning .",
    "rotational mixing allows the secondaries to start with lower mass and does not seem to require fine tuning .",
    "sufficient mixing can lead to quasi - homogeneous evolution and perhaps to low - mass helium star secondary stars .",
    "this possibility is of general interest , but may be especially interesting in the context of the progenitors of type ia supernovae .",
    "rotationally induced mixing may also be relevant in cases of single stars such as the  blue straggler \" stars ( bsss ) in open and globular clusters .",
    "many bsss are observed to rotate rapidly and to have depleted c / o abundances .",
    "some bsss may be slow rotators , but as we describe in  3.3 , some are observed to be rapid rotators .",
    "that seems sufficient to mention the possibility of rotationally - induced mixing without knowing the origin of the rotation , nor specifically invoking binary tidal locking as the origin of the rotation .",
    "we thus also explore the possibility of rotationally - induced mixing in bsss .",

    "we present an extensive comparison of the results in appendix a. there , we also compare our results with observations of nearby massive rotating stars provided by the vlt - flames survey ( hunter et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) .    in our suite of models , we find that the mixing is dominated by the meridional circulation and the st mechanism , with the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability having a minor role .",
    "the contribution of the st mechanism tends to be comparable to , or even slightly dominant over , the meridional circulation at mass fraction greater than 0.8 - 0.9 , and to dominate in a shell covering the mass fraction between 0.2 and 0.4 .",
    "while the basic physics of the st mechanism is solid , the employment of this complex , multi - dimensional process in a spherical model may be especially suspect .",

    "omission of the spruit - taylor mechanism changed our results considerably .",
    "we find that meridional mixing alone in low mass stars can not induce significant surface abundance changes that are adequate to explain the observed features of carbon - deficient binaries .",
    "we return to this point in the conclusions .",
    "we define a timescale , @xmath36 , as the time for the secondary star to evolve from non - contact to roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "this time - scale is ill - constrained due to uncertainties involved in the mechanism of angular momentum loss ( common envelope evolution , magnetic braking ) and can vary over a large range .",
    "we will discuss those uncertainties in more detail in  3.2 . as a fiducial value for the start of rlof , chosen in order to calibrate our results for different initial masses and present surface abundance ratios at this epoch in table 1",

    "this rate of mass loss reduces the secondary to a mass typically around 0.6  @xmath0 , characteristic of white dwarf - red dwarf binary systems such as ss cygni , within @xmath41  years .",
    "this mass loss rate is scaled up by four orders of magnitude if mass loss occurs on a thermal timescale , a scenario that we discuss in  4 .",
    "we emphasize that we consider the evolution of the secondary stars as single stars , and we do not model the evolution of the binary system as a whole . in the case of close binary systems , the secondary stars will experience tidal forces that will change the shape of the star .",
    "rotation will have the additional effect of inducing oblateness .",
    "those effects are not considered in our one - dimensional stellar evolution calculations .",
    "in order to illustrate the general effects of rapid rotation on the evolution of low - mass stars , we present the evolution of @xmath42 with time in the left panel and the evolution in the h - r diagram in the right panel of figure 1 for the 1  @xmath0 , @xmath4  @xmath5 model .",

    "the steep vertical lines for the non - rotating models in figures 2 - 5 represent the onset of evolution to the red giant branch , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "this transition is muted or modified for the rotating models .",
    "figures 2 - 6 show that rapidly rotating stars generally live longer than those of zero rotation .",
    "all evolutionary tracks have been computed almost up to core helium ignition .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the surface abundance of hydrogen , @xmath50 , for all the models . the depletion of hydrogen is stronger for intermediate masses and lower metallicities",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that somewhat higher mass stars have hotter interiors so that nuclear burning via the pp - chain and cno cycle processes is more efficient , but as the mass gets even higher , the star lives on the main - sequence for a smaller time that is not sufficient for mixing before it comes in contact or before turning into a giant .",
    "the 1  @xmath0 , @xmath4  0.01  @xmath5 , @xmath48  0.3 model reaches @xmath51  0.62 by the end of the ms . in figure 3 ,",
    "the same model is seen to be helium enriched on the surface , compared to the non - rotating case .",
    "the outcome of enhanced cno processing in rotating stars is best seen in figure 4 where depletion of carbon at the surface occurs towards high rotation , intermediate masses and lower metallicity and in figure 5 where the resulting @xmath47n enrichment is seen in the same regions of the parameter space .",
    "the results for all models are given in table 1 where the ratio of surface mass fraction for all those elements on the zams compared to that on the end of the ms is given .",
    "the effects of rotation on the composition structure of low mass secondaries are also illustrated in figure 7 .",
    "we observe that , even though homogenization is weaker in low mass stars than it is in more massive stars , the partial mixing that occurs is strong enough to drive abundance changes throughout the interior of the star .",
    "this also results in the cores of the rotating stars being somewhat more massive that those of non - rotating ones and in hydrogen depletion at the center being more pronounced , especially for lower metallicities .    in order to investigate the effects of rlof mass loss on the evolution of the surface abundances of our models",
    ", we have run the 1  @xmath0 , @xmath4  @xmath5 , @xmath48  0 and the 1  @xmath0 , @xmath4  @xmath5 , @xmath48  0.3 models up to @xmath36  @xmath52  @xmath53 years without rlof mass loss and then turned on a constant mass loss rate of @xmath54  @xmath0  yr@xmath40 , within the range expected for cvs .",
    "this mass loss is maintained until the total mass of the star is reduced to @xmath52  0.55  @xmath0 , requiring an interval of @xmath55  years .",
    "the evolution of the surface mass fraction of carbon , @xmath56 , for these models is shown as the solid ( non - rotating ) and dashed ( rotating ) light blue curves in the upper left panel of figure 4 . in the case of the non - rotating mass - losing model ,",
    "@xmath56 does not change much because carbon depletion is strong only in the inner  0.3  @xmath0 of the star and mass - stripping does not reach this depth .",
    "also , since we are left with a 0.55  @xmath0 star its ms life - time is significantly prolonged leaving @xmath56 at the same value for more than a hubble time . for the rotating , mass - losing model",
    "we see that rlof mass loss has only a small effect , a decrease of about a factor of 2 , on the further evolution of the surface carbon abundance .",
    "however , the comparison between the mass - losing non - rotating and rotating models indicates that rotationally - induced mixing leading to abundance changes throughout the whole stellar interior remains the main reason for @xmath56 depletion even when mass loss is accounted for , at least for the fiducial example presented here .",
    "it is the mixing that took place the first @xmath52  @xmath53 years that lead to carbon depletion in the surface as well as in some inner layers in different degrees with mass loss being a second order effect because in the absence of such mixing , as can be seen for the non - rotating mass - losing model , mass loss alone did not lead to significant changes . for both mass - losing cases",
    "we also note that once the stellar mass becomes small ( @xmath57  @xmath0 ) , carbon depletion is diminished because the core temperature becomes sufficiently low that the fusion of c to n can no longer take place .",
    "in addition , rotationally - induced mixing becomes less efficient . in reality , the process of rlof mass loss is , of course , more complicated and the mass loss rate changes with time such that it starts with initially very high mass loss rate then declines to values characteristic for cvs .",
    "we argue that the most interesting phase of chemically quasi - homogeneous evolution in rapidly rotating secondaries is that before the star loses significant amounts of mass via rlof .",
    "the extent of rlof mass loss itself has an impact only on the magnitude of these effects in the sense that deeper regions of the star are probed with somewhat different ( but not significantly so ) composition .",
    "the effects of rotationally - induced mixing on the surface abundances of low mass secondaries that we presented is  3.1 are only valid under the assumption that the secondary star rotates at relatively high velocities ( @xmath52  30% the critical value ) for a sufficient time , @xmath36 , before loss of angular momentum causes the secondary to fill its roche lobe and begin transfering mass to the white dwarf . to investigate the constraints of angular momentum loss on our results we calculate relevant time - scales .",
    "the time scales we wish to compare are the characteristic time - scales for synchronization , for sufficient mixing that leads to considerable surface abundance changes , and for angular momentum loss .",
    "first of all , we demand that the system be synchronized so that the orbital period is equal to the rotational period of the secondary .",
    "the synchronization time - scale for a binary system based on the influence on tides is given by the following expression ( zahn 1977 , 1989 ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a constant that depends on the structure of the secondary and is typically of the order of unity for stars with convective envelopes . for a combination of masses and for @xmath60  20 the synchronization time - scales are less than @xmath61  years , indicating that most of the systems under consideration synchronize rapidly compared to their ms life spans",
    ". this time - scale can be even shorter if radiative dissipation due to oscillation damping near the stellar surface is considered ( zahn 1975 ) .",
    "for the mixing time - scale , we choose a lower limit of @xmath62  years and an upper limit of @xmath63  years based on the maximum carbon depletion that we find for the representative models of 1  @xmath0 and 1.2  @xmath0 for @xmath4  0.1  @xmath5 and @xmath4  0.01  @xmath5 ( @xmath56 declines by about an order of magnitude for these models in the chosen time range ) .",
    "the angular momentum loss time - scale is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total orbital angular momentum and @xmath66 is the rate of change of the orbital angular momentum . we can write @xmath67 with @xmath0 the solar mass , @xmath10 the gravitational constant , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 the masses of the white dwarf , the secondary star and the sum of the two in units of the solar mass , respectively ( capital letters denote those masses in cgs units ) , and @xmath71 is the orbital frequency .",
    "the prescription for @xmath66 depends on the angular momentum loss mechanism .",
    "there are two basic models for angular momentum loss in binary systems : angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation ( for systems with shorter orbital periods ) and via magnetic braking ( for systems with larger orbital separation ) . for angular momentum loss by gravitational radiation paczynski ( 1967 )",
    "gives for @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 with @xmath75 the radius of the secondary star in cm .",
    "angular momentum loss by magnetic braking was introduced by verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 ) and is based on the principle that angular momentum is removed from the secondary via magnetically coupled stellar winds .",
    "then , from the orbital tidal synchronization and using their calculated @xmath66 we estimate @xmath76 for this process to be : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant of order of unity and @xmath79 .",
    "rappaport et al . ( 1983 ) offered an updated prescription for angular momentum loss with magnetic braking accounting for the structure of the radiative core and the convective envelope of the secondary . using their method",
    "we calculate : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a dimensionless parameter that ranges between 0 - 4 . for @xmath82  4 an expression close to that of verbunt & zwaan ( 1981 )",
    "is recovered . to better constrain the magnetic braking mechanism ,",
    "sills et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained rotational data from young open clusters and calibrated the theoretical predictions .",
    "they found that the mechanism is less efficient than previously thought . using equation 8 for @xmath66 from their work",
    ", we derive the corresponding angular momentum loss time - scale : @xmath83 where @xmath84  @xmath85 is the critical frequency at which the magnetic field apparently saturates ( krishnamurthi et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the convective overturn time - scales for the sun and for the secondary star respectively .",
    "sills et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find that a value of @xmath88  10  @xmath89 is needed to fit the data , and we adopt the same value in this work .",

    "their relation also has the form of a broken power law and also depends on the magnetic field saturation frequency .",
    "their prescription implies a time - scale for angular momentum loss given by the following formula : @xmath90 where @xmath91 , with @xmath92 the effective temperature of the secondary and @xmath93 the effective temperature of the sun . in order to calculate the numerical coefficients",
    "we have used @xmath94  @xmath95  rad  s@xmath40 .",
    "the more recent predictions for angular momentum loss by magnetic braking imply a less efficient mechanism than the older predictions .",
    "yet another correction to those laws comes from the fact that stars with a small or no convective mantle do not have a strong magnetic field and will therefore experience little or no magnetic braking ( podsiadlowski et al . 2002 ; van der sluys , verbunt & pols 2005 ) . in this case , a correction term @xmath96 can be defined , where @xmath97 is the fractional mass of the convective envelope . adopting this correction to the law of sills et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( equation 8) makes the effective angular momentum loss time - scale even larger .",
    "large angular momentum loss timescales of the order of a hubble time due to magnetic braking have also been discussed by andronov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ( see figure 4 of their paper ) as well as by willems et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in the context of these long magnetic braking time - scales , the period gap for cvs with orbital period between 2 and 3 hours",
    "is addressed by invoking two distinct populations . as discussed in andronov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , one population would comprise unevolved secondaries ( those with orbital periods of 2 hours or less ) and the other evolved secondaries ( with orbital periods of 3 hours or more ) .",
    "the large time scales for magnetic braking posited in the more recent papers imply that it is possible for some close systems to be synchronized and maintain nearly a constant orbital period for long enough that their secondaries rotationally mix , therefore yielding altered surface mass fractions for some elements .",
    "to illustrate this idea , we plot all the angular momentum loss time - scales discussed above as a function of orbital period in figures 8 and 9 . in figure 8",
    "we have done so for a system with @xmath49  1.2  @xmath0 and @xmath2  0.65  @xmath0 , which we suspect is similar to ss cyg prior to its contact with its roche lobe .",
    "the inset labels the various angular momentum loss time - scales for gravitational radiation and magnetic braking .",
    "it can be seen that for systems with @xmath98  7 - 8  hrs there is sufficient time for the secondary to undergo significant rotationally induced mixing before coming in contact with its roche lobe , if we accept the recently updated , less efficient magnetic braking laws . in general , for a secondary to sufficiently mix before transfering mass to the white dwarf , a fiducial system has to be in the region between the two dotted lines and towards smaller periods , so that the rotational velocity is higher and therefore the rotationally - induced mixing stronger . in addition , the system has be below the curves for angular momentum loss as calculated by making use of the latest prescriptions for angular momentum loss via magnetic braking in the same diagram . in figure 9",
    "we present the same plot , but in the particular case of the system v471  tau ( @xmath49  0.9  @xmath0 , @xmath2  0.84  @xmath0 , @xmath99  12.5  hrs ; obrien et al .",
    "2001 ) consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf secondary star .",
    "a lower limit for @xmath72 in this case was estimated by using the observed @xmath100 coming from the observed minus corrected ( @xmath101 ) diagram .",
    "it can be seen that it is possible that this system will mix in the future ; however , at that large separation , it probably will not exhibit a significant rotationally - induced mixing due to the low orbital frequency .",
    "we conclude that the type of binary system with low - mass secondaries that might undergo significant rotationally - induced mixing that leads to enhanced nitrogen and helium and depleted hydrogen and carbon surface abundances is one that evolves in a manner illustrated in figure 10 .",
    "initially ( panel a ) the system consists of a higher mass primary ( @xmath102 ) and a lower mass secondary ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "subsequently the system undergoes common envelope evolution and the primary dies , becoming a white dwarf , while the secondary is still on the main - sequence ( panel b ) . at this point",
    "the system is synchronized and the orbital separation is relatively small ( @xmath98  7 - 9  hrs ) .",
    "the system remains detached and the secondary rotates at high velocities 0.2  @xmath103  0.33 thus undergoing rotationally - induced mixing ( panel c ) . those fiducial orbital period and corresponding rotational angular velocity limits",
    "are implied for significant surface carbon depletion , as shown in figure 8 .",
    "the mixing significantly alters the surface element abundances by the end of the ms , leading to the depletion of carbon and the enchancement of nitrogen in the surface . finally ( panel d )",
    ", the system has lost sufficient angular momentum that the secondary comes in contact with its roche lobe and starts to transfer mass to the white dwarf .",
    "a long timescale between tidal locking and rlof is consistent with current theories of relatively weak magnetic braking . at the onset of rlof",
    ", unstable mass transfer could occur on the thermal time - scale of the secondary or stable mass transfer could ensue for mass ratio , @xmath104 on long time - scales characteristic of many cvs , as we have assumed for the model here .",
    "the mass transferred to the wd has different abundances than in cases where the secondary does not rotate rapidly and thus does not mix enough , or if the secondary fills its roche lobe before mixing is extensive",
    ".      the inclusion of the effects of rotation in the evolution of solar - type stars may also provide insight to some cases of blue straggler stars ( bsss ) first discovered by sandage ( 1953 ) in the gc m3 .",
    "bss are stars in open or globular clusters that appear to be on the ms but are more luminous and bluer than stars at the ms turn - off point in the cluster hr diagram .",
    "bss have been found in many globular and open clusters in the milky way , notably the globular cluster 47  tuc ( ferraro et al .",
    "2006 ) , the open cluster ngc  188 ( mathieu & geller 2009 ) and the globular cluster m4 ( lovisi et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "suggestions for the origin of bsss include mass transfer from primordial binaries in low density gcs ( mt - bsss ) or even stellar collisions , particularly those that involve binaries ( col - bsss ) in high star density gcs ( mccrea 1964 ; hills & day 1976 ; fusi pecci et al .",
    "1992 ; ferraro et al .",
    "2003 ; davies et al . 2004 ) .",
    "there is some evidence that both processes could be active in some clusters ( ferraro et al .",
    "there are still open issues concerning the surface chemical abundances of bsss .",
    "in particular , depleted c / o abundances are associated with bsss in some clusters , for example in 47  tuc ( ferraro et al .",
    "in addition , high equatorial velocity has been measured for many bsss : the equatorial velocity in 47  tuc is measured to be @xmath32  10  km  s@xmath40",
    "( ferraro et al . 2006 ) , in ngc  188 many bsss have velocities of up to 50  km  s@xmath40 ( mathieu & geller 2009 ) and in m4 the bsss equatorial velocities range from 10  km  s@xmath40 up to 150  km  s@xmath40 ( @xmath105  0.02 - 0.35 ) ( lovisi et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the depleted c / o abundances and relatively high rotation that are observed in some bsss indicate that rotationally - induced mixing leading to chemically homogeneous evolution might be relevant for some of those objects .",
    "the idea of prolonged strong mixing associated with bsss was first suggested by wheeler ( 1979 ; see also saio & wheeler 1980 ) . with the availability of stellar evolution codes that take into account the effects of rotation , we can attempt to evaluate this hypothesis .",
    "we ran mesa with 1  @xmath0 models for solar ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) , 10% solar ( @xmath4  0.1  @xmath5 ) and 1% solar ( @xmath4  0.01",

    "bss \" labeled boxes indicate where bss candidate stars are expected to be located in the hr diagram of a cluster .",
    "it is evident that the evolutionary tracks of stars with equatorial velocities @xmath32  10  km  s@xmath40 are well within the bss domain .",
    "given the fact that there is a spread in masses , compositions and equatorial velocities associated with bsss we expect that the bss labeled regions in figure 11 in reality will be even more densly populated with evolutionary tracks than the sample of models we present here .",
    "we conclude that quasi - homogeneous evolution due to rotationally - induced mixing may be an alternative , third channel to form bsss .",
    "the rotation to induce the mixing may have arisen in mass - transfer events , so all these mechanisms may be active .",
    "gnsicke et al.(2003 ) presented a variety of cvs with very large n@xmath107c@xmath108 flux ratios in far ultraviolet ( fuv ) spectra . in the same study",
    "it is estimated that 10 - 15% of close cvs that have gone through a phase of ttmt show this kind of surface abundance anomalies .",
    "similar cases of large n@xmath107c@xmath108 flux ratios have been observed in some black hole binary systems like xte  j1118 + 480 ( haswell et al . 2002 ; gelino et al .",
    "most low - mass close binaries are also synchronized and their secondaries are rapidly rotating and therefore evolve quasi - homogeneously due to rotationally - induced mixing .",
    "motivated by these observations , we ran a grid of evolutionary models of low mass secondaries for different degrees of metallicity and rotational velocity in order to study the effects of rotationally - induced mixing in these systems . vigorous rotationally - induced mixing led to a more chemically homogeneous evolution than in non - rotating standard evolution and enabled cno processing of material in a larger portion of the stellar interior . as a consequence ,",
    "the hydrogen and carbon surface abundances are reduced and the helium and nitrogen abundances enhanced .",
    "this effect is found to be stronger for intermediate mass ( 1 - 1.2  @xmath0 ) , increased rotation , and decreased metallicity for the secondary star .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is also bigger for longer time - scales after tidal locking and before encountering rlof mass loss .",
    "once rlof mass loss starts , the surface abundances do not change significantly and by the time rlof ends the secondary may be left with low enough mass that the core temperature is not high enough to burn the material that is mixed inwards , therefore preventing further homogenization and significant surface abundance changes . since carbon depletion",
    "is more pronounced for higher masses , it is possible that the secondaries of carbon depleted systems were once more massive , even up to 1.2 - 1.5  @xmath0 , and then lost a significant amount of mass .",
    "this can be achieved via a phase of unstable thermal time - scale mass transfer ( ttmst ; schenker et al .",
    "2002 ; podsiadlowski , han & rappaport 2003 ; gnsicke et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this case",
    ", systems with secondaries with mass up to 2  @xmath0 may subsequently evolve into cvs with low mass secondaries and slow transfer rates .",
    "if the secondary were a fast rotator , the mass transferred will have a high ratio of @xmath109 , in agreement with what is spectroscopically observed .",
    "therefore we conclude that rotationally - induced mixing could be one way to explain the carbon - depletion features of some of the systems discussed above .",

    "as discussed in  2 and in appendix a , we find interesting levels of rotationally - induced mixing only if we include the effects of the spruit - tayler dynamo on the transport of both angular momentum and chemical abundances .",

    "we emphasize that the inclusion of chemical mixing due to magnetic fields as parametrized by spruit ( 2002 ) is observationally motivated in the present work since it is necessary in order to explain the observed surface abundance changes in some low - mass secondary stars , members of close binaries that are rapid rotators , in the context of stellar evolution with the inclusion of the effects of rotation .",

    "1998 ; kato & hachisu 1999 ) making it very difficult to construct satisfactory models that grow the white dwarf to near the chandrasekhar mass , carbon ignition and thermonuclear explosion . at low accretion rates , the helium shell source in accreting white dwarf models may be thermally unstable even for non - degenerate cases ( cassisi et al .",

    "this might alter the conditions of shell burning and hence the constraints necessary for sucessful type ia explosions . based on our models ,",

    "further exploration of this issue requires thermonuclear hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "we note that although our rotating models linger longer on the main sequence , the luminosity does increase monotonically .",
    "models that are more helium enriched will thus also tend to be somewhat brighter than zams models of the same mass .",
    "all of our models with noticeable helium enrichment are brighter than the upper limit set on a particular sn ia progenitor system by schaefer & pagnotta ( 2012 ) .",

    "the effects of rotation in the transport of angular momentum and chemical mixing were only recently implemented in the stellar evolution code mesa ( paxton et al .",
    "2011 ) that we are using in the present paper .",
    "we present here comparisons of mesa with other established codes .",
    "specifically , we focus on the efficiency of the spruit - tayler ( st ) mechanism ( spruit 1999 , 2002 ) when the effects of magnetic fields are taken into account . while its precise utility and implementation may be questioned , the effect of the magnetic torques on angular momentum transport as implemented by spruit is used in many modern stellar evolution codes .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field on chemical mixing of elements is even more the subject of debate ( maeder & meynet 2003 ; 2004 ; 2005 , spruit 2006 ) . in some calculations chemical mixing by the st mechanism is found to lead to overly efficient mixing and surface n abundances that are higher than those suggested by observations of massive early b type stars in the milky way and in the lmc and smc ( hunter et al . 2008 ; 2009 ) .",
    "we therefore also focus on assessing the degree to which mesa models with rotation and magnetic fields agree with observations .",
    "we stress that this comparison is restricted to massive ( @xmath32  10  @xmath0 ) stars since we are not aware of observations of rapidly rotating solar mass stars and relative n abundance measurements .",
    "we note , however , that the findings of the present paper are observationally motivated ( depleted carbon abundaces in rapidly rotating secondary stars in close binaries ) and might constitute the first attempt to compare the effects of rotation and magnetic fields in solar type stars with direct observations .",
    "the effects of rotation on angular momentum transport ( but not chemical mixing ) , including magnetic torques as parametrized by spruit , have been included in several stellar evolution codes in the past . for the purposes of benchmarking mesa against some of those well - established codes we ran models similar to those presented by brott et al .",
    "( 2011a ; b ) , ekstrm et al . ( 2012 ) , heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) , yoon et al . ( 2006 ) and yoon , dierks & langer ( 2012 ) .",
    "the models we have selected have been computed by three different stellar evolution codes that include the effects of rotation and , in some cases , magnetic fields : the geneva code ( eggenberger et al . 2008 ) , the yoon & langer ( 2005 ) code and an updated version of the kepler code ( weaver et al .",
    "1978 ) that was first used by heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) to study progenitors of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the majority of the models computed in these works are for massive stars .",
    "therefore most of our comparisons are for massive stars with the exception of solar mass models computed in the grid of ekstrm et al .",
    "for all models run with mesa the same parameters ( initial mass and metallicity , zams rotational velocity , mixing and angular momentum transport efficiency ) have been adopted as the models with which we compare .",
    "the efficiency of rotational mixing ( @xmath31 ) is the main uncertain parameter for all models calculated .",
    "its value is mainly calibrated by observations of nearby rotating stars .",
    "the choice of 0.046 was proposed by pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 1989 ) in order to explain solar lithium abundances , while theoretical predictions by chaboyer & zahn ( 1992 ) provided a somewhat different value of 0.033 which was adopted in calculations of massive rotating models done by heger et al .",
    ". a somewhat smaller value of 0.0228 calibrated against observations of massive b type stars in the lmc was adopted by brott et al .",
    "( 2011a ; b ) .",
    "we first computed 10  @xmath0 models for @xmath4  0.0047 ( the metallicity of the lmc ) for four different equatorial rotational velocities at the zams : 58 , 116 , 232 and 345  km  s@xmath40 and for two cases : a case without the effects of st on the chemical mixing included and a second case that includes those effects .",
    "those parameters are exactly the same as those in brott et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "specifically we compare their result on the evolution of surface nitrogen enrichment presented in their figure 8 with our results , presented in figure a1 .",
    "as can be seen , the inclusion of the st mechanism does lead to somewhat higher surface nitrogen abundances than when it is not included , but in both cases the values we find for 12+@xmath111 $ ] are consistent with those found by brott et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "interestingly , the results between the two codes agree much better when st chemical mixing is included .",
    "next , we consider a 1  @xmath0 model at solar metallicity ( @xmath4  0.014 ) for a non - rotating case and a case with a rotational velocity of 50  km  s@xmath40 .",
    "the effects of st are accounted for in these models only in the transport of angular momentum and not in chemical mixing . in figure",
    "a2 we plot the evolution of the surface helium abundance ( upper left panel ) as well as the evolution of the surface abundance ratios [ n / c ] ( upper right panel ) and [ n / o ] ( lower left panel ) for the non - rotating ( black curve ) and the rotating ( red curve ) case .",
    "the end of the h - burning phase is indicated with the dashed vertical line in all panels .",
    "this figure can be directly compared to the results presented in table 2 of ekstrm et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for the same models .",
    "we see that the values for the surface he abundance we estimate with mesa at the end of the h - burning phase are generally a little higher ( 0.02 - 0.05 in mass fraction ) than the ones presented by ekstrm et al . , but the surface abundance ratios are very similar in the two works .",
    "any differences may be attributable to different algorithms between the codes and to numerical errors ( due to differences in resolution , for example ) .    for another comparison of mesa including the effects of rotation and of the st mechanism accounting only for the angular momentum transport we choose models recently presented by yoon , dierks & langer ( 2012 ) in their investigation of the evolution of massive population iii stars . specifically , we computed a 10  @xmath0 model of zero metallicity rotating at 40% the critical rotational velocity at the zams .",
    "for this model we show the mesa - computed h - r diagram in figure a3 that can be directly compared to the one presented by yoon , dierks & langer ( 2012 ) in their figure 1 ( upper left panel ) .",
    "mesa gives similar values and ranges for the effective temperature , @xmath112 , and the luminosity except that at later stages mesa gives slightly higher luminosities .",
    "we note that some peculiar  kinks \" on the hr track for this model are numerical artifacts related to limited resolution .",
    "similar numerical features are also seen in calculations of rotating progenitors of grbs by yoon & langer ( 2005 ) ( see the hr tracks presented in their figure 2 ) .",
    "also , at the end of the calculation mesa gives carbon - oxygen ( c / o ) core mass of 1.72  @xmath0 while yoon , dierks & langer ( 2012 ) find it to be 1.78  @xmath0 and a surface helium mass fraction of 0.348 in contrast with 0.32 that they find .",
    "now we proceed to benchmark mesa against other available results that include the effects of the magnetic fields both in angular momentum transport and in mixing of chemical elements . for these comparisons",
    "we start by considering the rotating , magnetic 15  @xmath0 model at solar metallicity that was presented by heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) .",
    "this is the archetypical paper that was used to implement rotation and magnetic fields in mesa .",
    "one of the mesa built - in test problems is the same as the one we present here , and it is the original model that was used to evaluate the effects of rotation as calculated by mesa . for this model , an initial zams rotational velocity of 200  km  s@xmath40 is used .",
    "figure a4 shows the evolution of he , c , n and o surface mass fractions as calculated by mesa for a non - rotating ( black curves ) , a rotating ( red curves ) and a rotating plus magnetic ( blue curves ) case .",
    "the dashed vertical lines of the same colors represent the time at which the central hydrogen mass fraction was down to @xmath52  35% for each model in order to directly compare with the results presented in table 6 of heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) .",
    "we see very good agreement of the mesa results with the results of heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) .",
    "we note that the inclusion of chemical mixing due to st leads to somewhat larger abundance changes and , consequently , stronger surface nitrogen enhancements .",
    "this result is also obtained by maeder & meynet ( 2004 ) were they suggest that such differences might indicate that the spruit ( 2002 ) prescriptions for chemical mixing due to magnetic fields lead to overestimates .",
    "the other available independent calculations of stellar evolution with rotation and magnetic fields in both angular momentum transport and chemical mixing are found in yoon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . to perform a comparison with mesa we select the 12  @xmath0 model with initial metallicity of @xmath4  0.004 and initial ( zams ) equatorial rotational velocity of 354.14  km  s@xmath40 . in figure a5",
    "we show the evolution of the surface nitrogen abundance for this model as calculated by mesa in the case for which st is not considered in chemical mixing ( black curve ) and in the case for which it is ( red curve ) . at time @xmath113",
    "@xmath114  years , we see that 12+@xmath111 $ ]  @xmath115  8.1 - 8.4 for the two cases . using the results presented in table 4 of yoon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we estimate that in their model 12+@xmath111 = $ ]  8.26 , a value that is in good agreement with ours . at the same time in the evolution ,",
    "the mass of the c / o core is 1.91  @xmath0 for the mesa model that includes the effects of st on mixing . for the same model calculated by yoon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) the mass of the c / o core is 1.892  @xmath0 , indicating that the mixing processes that lead to the formation of the core in the two codes also give very similar result at the same evolutionary stage .",
    "the comparison of mesa stellar evolution with rotation and magnetic fields to these other codes indicates that mesa accounts for these effects as well as they do , specifically if one accounts for differences between codes , numerical errors , different model resolutions and specific numerical techniques that can interact in non - linear ways .",
    "major indicators of the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on chemical mixing such as surface nitrogen and helium enrichements and c / o core masses are found to have a similar range of values amongst different stellar evolution codes .",
    "this agreement enables us to take a step further and directly compare the mesa results on surface nitrogen abundances of rotating stars with spectroscopic observations of rotating stars in the milky way , the lmc and the smc recently presented by the vlt - flames survey of massive stars ( hunter et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ) . to enable this comparison , we computed an additional mesa model for a 15  @xmath0 star at solar metallicity ( @xmath4  0.014 ) rotating at 150  km  s@xmath40 for two cases : one with the effects of the st mechanism on chemical mixing ignored and one with those effects considered .",
    "the evolution of 12+@xmath111 $ ] for this model is presented in figure a6 .",
    "direct comparison with figure 6 of hunter et al .",
    "( 2009 ) illustrates that mesa estimates for the range of 12+@xmath111 $ ] values are consistent with those measured for massive rotating stars in the milky way .",
    "similar results are obtained for the same model at the higher rotational velocity of 200  km  s@xmath40 , which we calculated in order to compare with the results of heger , woosley & spruit ( 2005 ) .",
    "the higher rotational velocity led to slightly higher values for 12+@xmath111 $ ] but still within the range of the observations presented by hunter et al .",
    "in addition , the models that we calculated for a metallicity of @xmath4  0.0047 in order to compare with the results of brott et al .",
    "( 2011b ) show 12+@xmath111 $ ] values ( figure a1 ) that agree very well with the observations of hunter et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for massive early b type stars in the lmc ( their figure 5 ) .    as we mentioned above",
    ", there are currently no existing 12+@xmath111 $ ] observations in single solar type rapidly rotating stars that can be compared to evolutionary model predictions in the low mass range .",
    "just such a comparison was the initial observational motivation of the present work : to account for carbon depletion in the secondary stars of some cvs and lmxbs which are close binaries and tidally locked , therefore rapidly rotating , based on calibrations that have been done for higher mass stars ( and for the sun ) for which observations are available .",
    "there certainly is a degree of uncertainty associated with the calculations , specifically when the effects of the st mechanism on chemical mixing are included . in general the inclusion of these effects",
    "leads to somewhat higher abundances for some models of massive rapidly rotating stars than those suggested by some observations while in some calculations the results are consistent with observations ( maeder & meynet 2005 ) .",
    "given the differences in computational algorithm that were discussed above and the uncertainties in the measurement of initial metallicities ( upon which the results for surface abundance changes are sensitive ) it remains unclear whether the inclusion of the effects of st mixing necessarily lead to wrong results . in the cases investigated by this paper it is suggested that those effects of increased mixing efficiency due to the st mechanism are necessary if rotation and magnetic fields can be used as an explanation . to illustrate the importance of st mixing in our models we present the distribution of the diffusion coefficients due to meridional circulation ( eddington - sweet circulation ; es ) , the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability ( gsf ) and the st mechanism in figure a7 for one of our models ( 1  @xmath0 rotating at 30% the critical value ) at about the half of its main sequence lifetime for a case where st was ignored in calculations of the chemical mixing ( left panel ) and a case where st was included ( right panel ) . from this plot it is obvious that st dominates chemical mixing through most of the stellar interior as well as the surface , and in some cases it is more than an order of magnitude more important than meridional circulation .",
