    "shortly after the prediction of relativistically broadened iron k@xmath0 fluorescence lines in the x - ray spectra of accreting black holes @xcite , it was realized that if the lines were variable then constraints on the emission geometry and basic black hole parameters could be determined @xcite .",
    "these ideas matured into the prospect of iron line reverberation mapping , which , given a series of short time - resolved x - ray spectra following a significant flare in the continuum , could accurately derive such fundamental parameters as the black hole mass , spin , and location of the x - ray source(s ) @xcite .",
    "the promise of this technique is such that iron line reverberation mapping of nearby seyfert  1s is one of the principal science goals of the upcoming _ constellation - x _ observatory .    in recent years",
    "it has become obvious that reverberation mapping will be more challenging than perhaps was previously thought .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ telescope has found only a handful of relativistically broadened fe  k@xmath0  lines , which indicates that these components may be in general quite weak and low contrast features .",
    "moreover , the best example of a relativistic line ( observed from mcg6 - 30 - 15 ; @xcite ) exhibits less variability than the x - ray continuum and shows no correlation with the observed broadband flux ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "these properties seem to apply on long timescales in a wide sample of bright seyfert  1 galaxies @xcite , but there also have been instances of rapid iron line variation with only a slight continuum change ( mrk 841 ; @xcite ) , and where the line at least partially follows the continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . clearly , there is a wide range of possible fe  k@xmath0  variability characteristics .",
    "the problem these observations cause with the standard reverberation picture is with the underlying assumption that variations in the fe  k@xmath0line are directly related to changes in the observed continuum .",
    "the observed behavior shows that this assumption can not be valid at all times , and that there are other effects which are equally important to the production of the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "one possible perturbation to the previous reverberation calculations is photoionization of the accretion disk surface by the incident x - rays ( the work by @xcite , e.g. , assumed only neutral reflection from the disk outside of the innermost stable circular orbit ) .",
    "if the disk surface is ionized to a certain level , then the fe  k@xmath0  equivalent width ( ew ) becomes anti - correlated with the continuum , in contrast to the positive correlation expected if the disk remains neutral @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the x - ray continuum incident on the disk is different from the observed one .",
    "for example , light - bending effects could enhance the illumination @xcite , while an outflowing corona could diminish it @xcite .",
    "while these effects may all be operating at some level , they are still connected with the x - ray continuum , and therefore a relation ( positive or negative ; strong or weak ) between the fe  k@xmath0  line flux and the incident continuum is expected . in this paper , we outline a process by which the fe  k@xmath0  line may vary independently of the illuminating x - ray flux .    for systems accreting at greater than 0.3% of the eddington rate ,",
    "the innermost annuli of the accretion disk , where the relativistic portion of the iron k@xmath0 line is produced , are likely radiation pressure dominated @xcite .",
    "numerical results indicate that turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) may involve large density fluctuations in radiation - dominated disks if magnetic pressure exceeds gas pressure and photons diffuse from compressed regions @xcite .",
    "large density variations may also be caused by the photon bubble instability ( pbi ; @xcite ) , which may develop into a series of shocks propagating through the plasma @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that radiation - dominated disks have time - varying density inhomogeneities on scales smaller than the disk thickness . in the first paper of this series ( @xcite , hereafter paper i )",
    ", we showed that density variations in the outermost few thomson depths can lead to reflection spectra differing from those of uniform slabs .",
    "here , we continue our investigation of x - ray reflection from inhomogeneous accretion disks by computing the evolution of the reflection spectrum as the disk structure is changing due to the pbi .",
    "as is shown below , the changing density structure in the disk can affect the ew and line flux of the predicted emission lines , despite the constant illuminating continuum .",
    "the next section details the setup and conditions of the pbi model and reflection calculations .",
    "we then present the results of the reflection models , both as a function of time and time - averaged (   [ sect : res ] ) .",
    "the results are then discussed in ",
    "[ sect : discuss ] before we summarize and draw our conclusions in ",
    "[ sect : concl ] .",
    "an important timescale in x - ray reflection is the time for the accretion disk to re - establish hydrostatic balance following a change in illumination @xcite .",
    "the adjustment time is about equal to the orbital period @xcite .",
    "turbulence inside the disk results from the mri and also has a characteristic overturn time similar to the orbital period @xcite . in radiation - dominated disks ,",
    "the pbi may grow faster than the orbital frequency @xcite , and could lead to structures that vary over a small fraction of an orbit .",
    "below we examine time variations in the x - rays reflected from structures produced by the growth of photon bubbles .",
    "the variations are computed in two steps , as in paper i. first , density distributions resulting from the instability are found using a two - dimensional , time - dependent numerical radiation magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) calculation .",
    "the density profile along a single ray passing vertically through the disk is used as the input for the second step .",
    "we assume x - rays from a diffuse external source strike the disk , and calculate the reflected spectrum by solving the coupled equations of radiative transfer and ionization balance in one spatial dimension .",
    "the effects of changes in the density profile are tracked by calculating the spectrum 100 times per orbital period .",
    "the calculation of the growth of photon bubbles is similar to that described in paper i. a narrow annulus of accretion disk in orbit around a black hole of @xmath2 at a distance @xmath3 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath4 ) is modeled in locally cartesian coordinates in two dimensions , with symmetry assumed along the orbit .",
    "the frequency - averaged equations of radiation mhd are integrated using the zeus code @xcite with its flux - limited radiation diffusion module @xcite , on a grid of @xmath5 uniformly - spaced zones .",
    "the initial condition is a shakura - sunyaev model with accretion rate 10% of the eddington limit for 10% radiative efficiency , and accretion stress parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the total thomson optical depth is 9200 . to this",
    "is added a uniform magnetic field with pressure 1% of the midplane radiation pressure , inclined @xmath7 from horizontal .",
    "the initial state is disturbed slightly by applying random density perturbations of up to 1% in each grid zone .",
    "the domain extends 1.2 shakura - sunyaev semi - thicknesses either side of the midplane and has width one - sixth the height .",
    "the horizontal boundaries are periodic , and the vertical boundaries allow gas , radiation and magnetic fields to flow out but not in",
    ". differential rotation is neglected , so there is no magneto - rotational instability and no external energy source .",
    "the radiation initially present escapes through the top and bottom boundaries , and the gas cools over time .",
    "the flux of radiation energy leaving each face of the disk initially is @xmath8  erg  @xmath9  s@xmath10 . during the first 0.8 orbits of the calculation",
    ", photon bubbles grow to non - linear amplitudes and develop into trains of shocks .",
    "photons then diffuse faster through the low - density regions between the shocks and the disk flux is several times greater than initially . by 2.35 orbits ,",
    "three - quarters of the initial radiation energy is lost , and the horizontally - averaged disk thickness approximately halves .",
    "a density floor of 1% of the initial midplane value or @xmath11  g  @xmath12 is imposed during the calculation so that results are obtained with a reasonable amount of computer time .",
    "the floor is applied in the regions between shocks , reducing the overall density contrast .",
    "the dynamical time for this radius is @xmath13  s. the orbital period is @xmath14 seconds , or about nine days .",
    "the density profile along a ray passing vertically through domain center is stored every 0.01  orbits for use in the x - ray reflection calculations .",
    "each density profile was trimmed so that the total thomson depth through the gas was about 10 . the number of zones in the density cuts varied from a minimum of 23 to a maximum of 71 .",
    "reflection spectra were then computed for each profile using the code described by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the illuminating continuum was a power - law defined between 1  ev and 100  kev  with a photon index @xmath15 .",
    "the gas was allowed to come into thermal and ionization balance before the reflection spectrum was computed ( these timescales are generally much shorter than the hydrostatic time ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the following ions are included in the calculations : , , , , and .",
    "four different illuminating fluxes @xmath16 were used for each density profile in order to investigate differences due to ionization effects .",
    "these fluxes corresponded to @xmath170.5 , 1 , 4 , and 8 . here",
    ", @xmath18 corresponds to the initial disk flux , and @xmath16 does not change with time .",
    "all 944 ionized reflection models converged with no problems .    of course ,",
    "this procedure is not self - consistent , as the heating due to the illuminating x - rays is not included in the gas dynamics .",
    "similarly , the internal radiation field in the mhd calculation does not change the ionization state of the gas , nor is it included in the outgoing spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , time - dependent 2-d and 3-d calculations of an x - ray illuminated accretion disk with ionization physics , frequency - dependent radiative transfer and mhd are still years away .",
    "however , we expect that the omissions described above do not greatly affect our results .",
    "the internal radiation field has temperatures @xmath19  k , so neglecting its ionizing power does not affect the high energy spectrum that is the focus of this paper . ignoring the effects of x - ray heating on the gas structure is more problematic , as an optically thick skin may form on the disk surface in hydrostatic models with @xmath20 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this skin would then scatter and smear out the reflection spectrum .",
    "however , the return to hydrostatic balance after a pressure perturbation takes about an orbit , so the mri and pbi may cause permanent disequilibrium .",
    "the turbulence driven by the mri can lead to density changes in the gas on the orbital period @xcite and can mix irradiated gas in to large optical depths .",
    "the fastest photon bubble modes have growth time shorter than the orbital period by the square root of the ratio of radiation to gas pressure .",
    "this estimate follows from table  2 of @xcite if radiation and magnetic pressures exceed the gas pressure , as in the surface layers in a 3-d radiation - mhd calculation of a small patch of disk that includes the generation and buoyancy of the magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "furthermore in the numerical photon bubble calculation described at the start of this section , the instability leads to a radiative flux with horizontal component comparable to the vertical .",
    "the horizontal flux varies across the face of the disk so the atmosphere feels substantial differential stresses . as is seen below , the densities change over periods as short as a few percent of an orbit , and the gas is out of hydrostatic balance from the time the instability reaches non - linear amplitudes until the end of the calculation .",
    "these results suggest that like the disk itself , any x - ray heated skin is inhomogeneous and time - variable .",
    "the effects of irradiation on a turbulent atmosphere may be worth investigating with future calculations .",
    "to quantify any changes made to the reflection spectra by the evolution of the pbi , we calculated the fe  k@xmath0  and  ly@xmath0 ews from each spectrum .",
    "since the @xmath15 power - law will also be observed along with the reflection component , the two spectra were summed before the ew calculations were performed .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : ews ] , with the different lines denoting the different values of @xmath21 .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0  ew spans the range from 2060  ev when @xmath171 and the line is suppressed due to auger destruction @xcite , up to @xmath22  ev when @xmath178 and a strong ionized line at 6.7  kev  is present .",
    "the plots show that there was little variation in the ews of the emission lines over the first orbit , but large changes occurred afterward as the pbi grew in magnitude . a very significant variation in the fe  k@xmath0  ew occurred between orbits 0.9 and 1.2 , where the density at the outermost layers of the atmosphere increased by @xmath23% .",
    "despite the small increase in density , it greatly altered the fe  k@xmath0  ew , particularly when the line originated from ionized iron ( i.e. , when @xmath174 ) . in that case , the fe  k@xmath0  ew dropped by a factor of @xmath24 due to a decrease of the effective ionization parameter and an increase of the continuum absorption .",
    "on the other hand , when a neutral 6.4  kev  line dominated or when the atmosphere was very highly illuminated , the small increase in density between orbits 1.0 and 1.1 caused much smaller changes in the fe  k@xmath0  ew ( 2040  ev ) .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sect : models ] , a density floor equivalent to @xmath25  @xmath12 was used in the pbi simulation .",
    "tests with a floor artificially lowered by a factor of 10 resulted in a more ionized reflection spectrum , as if @xmath16 had been increased and the density was left unchanged .",
    "we conclude that the density floor will not qualitatively affect the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ews ] .    as an illustration of the rapidity of the possible changes to the reflection spectrum , figure  [ fig : orbits ]",
    "plots the model spectra between 0.01  kev  and 20  kev  for every 0.01 of an orbit between orbits 1.6 and 1.69 .",
    "the illuminating flux is @xmath174 , and , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ews ] , the fe  k@xmath0  ew drops and recovers by @xmath26  ev over this range .",
    "the inset in each panel shows the hydrogen number density @xmath27 profile used in the reflection calculation and the equilibrium gas temperature found from the model .",
    "these plots illustrate that the density profile in the outer 10 thomson depths of the accretion disk can change significantly over as little as 0.01 of an orbit .",
    "some of the changes affect the reflection spectra , and some of them do not ( depending on how strongly the atmosphere is photoionized ) . however , in this case , a rapid increase in density at the surface of the atmosphere caused a significant variation in the strength of the predicted fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "the second region of large amplitude line variability takes place about a full orbit after the first instance , between orbits 1.9 and 2.2 .",
    "the density at the outer part of the atmosphere increased rapidly ( over only 0.06 orbits ) as a shock front propagated diagonally along magnetic field lines into the ray we are considering .",
    "the resulting changes in density structure as the shock passes through the ray results in the fe  k@xmath0  ew to vary drastically and show slight oscillatory behavior ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "we have thus clearly shown that changes in the accretion disk structure can cause rapid variability in the fe  k@xmath0  ew , _ despite the continuum remaining constant_.    the right - hand panel in figure  [ fig : ews ] illustrates the changes to the  ly@xmath0 line resulting from the evolution of the pbi .",
    "the line , of course , is weaker when the disk is more highly ionized at large @xmath21 .",
    "the density enhancements that pass through the surface of the disk after about 1 orbit , decrease the local ionization parameter and increase the  ew , often by @xmath28  ev , except for @xmath171 and 0.5 . in these cases the increase in density makes it difficult for the weak continuum to ionize much oxygen , resulting in enhanced continuum absorption that suppresses that low energy reflection spectrum . in these cases ,",
    "the  ew will be ( sometimes drastically ) reduced .",
    "unlike the fe  k@xmath0line , the  ew exhibits small amplitude rapid variability between orbits 1 and 2 .",
    "this is because the soft x - ray lines are very sensitive to where the illuminated gas is most rapidly cooling . as a result ,",
    "the strength of the  line , as well as the and lines , are more sensitive to the density structure than the fe  k@xmath0  line ( see also paper i ) .",
    "since the ew is a measure of the line strength relative to the continuum , and the illuminating continuum is held constant in these calculations , the variations in both the fe  k@xmath0  and  ew are entirely due to intrinsic changes in the line flux in the reflection spectrum .",
    "therefore , measurements of the line flux would also see changes of similar magnitude due to this effect .",
    "the variations presented above occurred on timescales as short as a few one - hundredths of an orbit , or @xmath29@xmath30  ks for the radius and black hole mass assumed for the simulation .",
    "this time is too short to accumulate a high quality spectrum with modern observatories such as _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ except for the brightest seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "typical observations need to be many times longer for proper spectral analysis , which will average over any variations in the emission lines due to the changing accretion disk structure .",
    "thus , it is interesting to check whether the time - averaged spectra presented in   [ sub : orbit ] retain any knowledge of the unstable disk structure .",
    "we follow very similar procedures as described in paper i. for each value of @xmath21 , we averaged together 156 reflection spectra between orbits 0.8 and 2.35 ( in order to concentrate on the region where the pbi is most important ) and simulated a 40  ks _ xmm - newton _ observation with xspec v.11.3.0p @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 power - law was added to each averaged reflection spectrum so that the reflection fraction @xmath31 is unity .",
    "the simulated spectra were then fit with reflection models computed by the same code assuming a constant density of @xmath32  @xmath12 .",
    "the results of the spectral fitting are shown in table  [ table : avg ] .",
    "the fits are generally acceptable in the 0.212  kev  energy range , but are greatly improved in the 210  kev  band . as a result of their sensitivity to the density structure ,",
    "the soft x - ray emission features caused most of the difficulty in fitting the 0.212  kev  simulated data ( see also paper i ) .",
    "the worst reduced @xmath33 obtained was for the @xmath21=0.5 model over the 0.212  kevband .",
    "the residuals to this fit are shown in figure  [ fig : resid ] , and are due to the slab model incorrectly accounting for the soft x - ray emission lines .",
    "however , the high energy continuum is well modeled by a uniform reflector .",
    "this exercise suggests that the density variations at the surface of the disk will not greatly affect the time - averaged reflection spectra above 2  kev  ( but see   [ sub : impli ] ) .",
    "moreover , constant density reflection models will be useful to parameterize observed spectra with an ionization parameter and reflection strength provided that the observing time is long compared to the fluctuation timescale in the disk .",
    "in paper i we showed that density inhomogeneities in the surface layers of radiation dominated accretion disks could potentially impact the reflection spectrum .",
    "that paper also suggested that the motion and evolution of any inhomogeneities in a real accretion disk might cause line variability that is independent of the illuminating radiation field .",
    "here , we have confirmed that suggestion by explicitly showing variations in the fe  k@xmath0  and  ly@xmath0 ew on timescales as short as a few one - hundredths of an orbital time as a result of the evolution of the pbi , which is relevant for radiation dominated accretion disks .",
    "this mechanism provides a natural explanation for any short timescale fe  k@xmath0  variability that is uncorrelated with the continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , fig .  [",
    "fig : ews ] indicates that the sudden change in fe  k@xmath0  ew observed in mrk  841 @xcite could easily be accounted for by changes in the accretion disk structure .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in paper i , the narrow , redshifted lines that have been recently inferred in the spectra of ngc  3516 @xcite and mrk  766 @xcite could originate in density inhomogeneities at a particular radius in the disk atmosphere .",
    "if this is the case , then our results indicate the lines should be variable on timescales about 1% of the orbital period of the emitting patch .",
    "while the statistics are generally poor , there is evidence for variability in these narrow lines .",
    "future data will be able to provide a better test of this hypothesis .",
    "the time - averaged reflection spectra from the pbi calculation showed no obvious indication of the variations on smaller timescales .",
    "however , we can not rule out rapid variations in disk structure that produce iron k@xmath0 changes drastic enough to be detected in observations lasting several orbits . in this paper",
    ", we considered only one black hole mass , accretion rate , position in the disk and magnetic field arrangement .",
    "for the parameters chosen , the fe  k@xmath0  region is readily fit with a uniform - slab reflection model , while the soft x - ray region in some cases is not . clearly , there is wide parameter space that needs to be explored in order to determine the full impact the pbi and mri will have on x - ray reflection spectra .",
    "the results in   [ sect : res ] have important implications for upcoming fe  k@xmath0  reverberation mapping attempts with _ constellation - x_. if accretion disk structural changes can cause the fe  k@xmath0  line to vary independently of the continuum on timescales much smaller than @xmath34 ( @xmath35  s , for the photon bubble simulation shown here ) , then it will become an important source of noise for the reverberation experiments",
    ". this will be especially true for reverberation experiments probing small radii around low mass black holes ( say , @xmath36  m@xmath37 ) . in that case",
    ", the disk structure may vary on timescales as short as 100 seconds or less , comparable to the x - ray variability timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the current transfer functions computed for reverberation mapping have all neglected the effects of ionization of the disk surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can result in an anti - correlation between the line ew and continuum @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the combined effects of a variable density structure ( due to the pbi and perhaps other instabilities ) and ionization state ( due to changes in the x - ray illumination ) will significantly complicate the results of any reverberation experiment . what is needed to provide concrete predictions for reverberation mapping is time dependent",
    "ionized reflection calculations where the illuminating flux is related to the underlying magnetic stress ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or outgoing magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "this is a direction for future research .    in the standard reverberation mapping scenario ,",
    "the idea is to observe changes in the fe  k@xmath0  line , as x - rays from a flare sweep across the disk .",
    "the pbi will likely be ongoing at every radius in the inner region of the disk , but will be subject to local conditions , such as the strength and geometry of the magnetic field . moreover , the linear growth rate of the pbi increases as one moves to smaller radii @xcite .",
    "therefore , the disk structure will be very position dependent as the x - rays flash overhead , so that the reflection spectrum could show variability due to disk inhomogeneities as a function of position , as well as time .",
    "pbi simulations spanning a larger range in radius would be necessary to test the possibility of reflection spectra variability due to positional changes .    if different radii produce different variability properties , than the observed variations may be diluted if the x - rays illuminate a wide enough range of radii . however , there are often times when the agn continuum is likely dominated by a single flare or a number of small flares which occur in close proximity to one another ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    ". in this case , which is the most relevant for reverberation mapping , then the one - zone models employed here may be useful .",
    "the signature of a changeable disk atmosphere is , of course , short timescale fe  k@xmath0  ( and  ly@xmath0 , if observable ) variability which is independent of the observed continuum .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to observationally test if this process is important . as mentioned above ,",
    "such cases of rapid changes in the fe  k@xmath0  line have been observed ( e.g. , mrk  841 ) , but these can not be used as evidence that effects of disk instabilities have been observed ( although it may provide a good explanation ) .",
    "there still remains too many unknowns regarding the location and dynamics of the x - ray source providing the illuminating continuum .",
    "the long timescale disconnectedness between the fe  k@xmath0  line and continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests it is possible , if not likely , that at some level the disk sees a different irradiating continuum than what is observed .",
    "numerical simulations of coronal formation above accretion disks , still some years away , may provide the clues to understanding the x - ray source in agn .",
    "the reflection spectra that were averaged over the variability caused by the pbi were well described by a constant density model in the 210  kev  band .",
    "the implication is that , over this energy range , the spectrum is dominated by emission from a single ionization parameter . since the illuminating flux is known for these test cases , the best fit @xmath38 can be used to determine @xmath39 , the density at which the most important spectral features are formed ( see table  [ table : avg ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is always less than 10@xmath41  @xmath12 , the density actually used in the constant density models , indicating that the ionization level is higher than expected given the illuminating flux . as can be seen in the density profiles plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbits ] , @xmath40 predominantly falls within the first 12  thomson depths of the atmosphere .",
    "we conclude that reflection spectra above 2  kev  are effectively determined by the ionization parameter at a thomson depth of @xmath42 . at lower energies ,",
    "the carbon , nitrogen and oxygen cooling lines , which are very sensitive to the density structure , cause the spectra to exhibit features from different effective ionization parameters , and thus are more difficult to fit with a uniform density model .",
    "the fits with the constant density models suggest that changes in the calculated spectra on 0.01 - 0.1 orbit timescales are difficult to detect in the longer integrations",
    ". however , there may be regimes where rapid changes in disk structure produce clear signatures in the fe k@xmath0 region in observations lasting several orbits . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sub : var ] , we considered only one black hole mass , accretion rate , position in the disk and magnetic field arrangement .",
    "thus , there is a wide parameter space to be explored to determine the impact of accretion disk inhomogeneities on x - ray reflection spectra .",
    "nevertheless , insofar as can be determined , these results ( along with those from paper i ) indicate that constant density models provide a good indication of the average ionization state of the accretion disk atmosphere on long timescales .",
    "our conclusions from the second paper in our study on x - ray reflection from heterogeneous accretion disks can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "changes in the density structure of an accretion disk atmosphere from the photon bubble instability can give rise to rapid variability of emission lines in the x - ray reflection spectrum .",
    "these variations would be observed to be independent of the illuminating continuum .",
    "2 .   this process gives a natural explanation for any short timescale ( e.g. , hours ) line variability that seemed to be uncorrelated with the x - ray continuum ( for example , mrk  841 ) .",
    "however , these observations can not be used as proof that disk instabilities are causing the line variations . nor",
    "can it offer an explanation for the uncorrelated behavior of the fe  k@xmath0  line on longer timescales ( greater than a day ) , although we can not rule out such an effect in a different region of parameter space .",
    "3 .   the timescale of the variability was found to be as small as a few one - hundredths of an orbital time .",
    "therefore , this effect , combined with any changes in ionization state , could be a serious source of noise for future reverberation studies .",
    "4 .   averaging the individual reflection spectra over the 1.55 orbits most affected by the pbi yielded spectra corresponding to the more common long timescale x - ray agn observations .",
    "these averaged spectra were well fit above 2  kev  by constant density models .",
    "photon bubble structures move across the surface of the disk in the radiation mhd calculations , passing in and out of the ray where we extracted density profiles .",
    "variations in the x - rays reflected from a region containing many structures may be less than those from a single line of sight .",
    "the separations , strengths and orientations of the structures are found to vary with the alignment and strength of the magnetic fields .",
    "the fields are likely to evolve over orbital timescales along with the turbulence inside the disk .",
    "two and three - dimensional reflection calculations may be useful in studying the consequences for reverberation mapping .",

    "<S> one of the principal scientific objectives of the upcoming _ constellation - x _ mission is to attempt to map the inner regions of accretion disks around black holes in seyfert galaxies by reverberation mapping of the fe  k@xmath0  fluorescence line . </S>",
    "<S> this area of the disk is likely radiation pressure dominated and subject to various dynamical instabilities . here , we show that density inhomogeneities in the disk atmosphere resulting from the photon bubble instability ( pbi ) can cause rapid changes in the x - ray reflection features , even when the illuminating flux is constant . using a simulation of the development of the pbi </S>",
    "<S> , we find that , for the disk parameters chosen , the fe  k@xmath0  and  ly@xmath0 lines vary on timescales as short as a few hundredths of an orbital time . in response to the changes in accretion disk structure , </S>",
    "<S> the fe  k@xmath0  equivalent width ( ew ) shows variations as large as @xmath1100  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude and direction ( positive or negative ) of the changes depends on the ionization state of the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the largest changes are found when the disk is moderately ionized . </S>",
    "<S> the  ew varies by tens of ev , as well as exhibiting plenty of rapid , low - amplitude changes . </S>",
    "<S> this effect provides a natural explanation for some observed instances of short timescale fe  k@xmath0  variability which was uncorrelated with the continuum ( e.g. , mrk  841 ) . </S>",
    "<S> new predictions for fe  k@xmath0  reverberation mapping should be made which include the effects of this accretion disk driven line variability and a variable ionization state . </S>",
    "<S> reflection spectra averaged over the evolution of the instability are well fit by constant density models in the 210  kev  region . </S>"
