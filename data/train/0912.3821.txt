    "the source of the high - energy activity of grlbs is uncertain",

    "it is commonly assumed that the  emission is produced in result of interaction of the relativistic outflow from the compact object with the non - relativistic wind and radiation field of companion massive star . neither the nature of the compact object ( black hole or neutron star ? ) nor the geometry ( isotropic or anisotropic ? ) and physical properties ( electron - positron or electron - proton composition ? ) of relativistic wind from this compact object are known in in most of the grlbs . the only exception is  system in which the compact object is known to be a young rotation powered pulsar which produces relativistic pulsar wind",

    "1  tev band is expected , because  flux in this energy band is strongly affected by the effect of pair production on the ultra - violet photon field of companion star @xcite .",
    "fig.[abs ] shows the attenuation of  spectrum due to the @xmath3 pair production at different orbital phases under the assumption that the tev flux comes directly from the compact object .",
    "strongest attenuation of the source flux occurs close to the periastron / inferior conjunction of the orbit .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ abs ] that if the observed gev - tev emission originates from the vicinity of the compact object , the pair production optical depth along the line of sight is too small to explain the suppression of the source flux at several gev .",
    "if  emission comes from an extended region or interaction of relativistic wind / jet with the wind of companion star , the emission region could be situated closer to the be star surface leading to stronger attenuation of  flux . although account of spatial geometry of  emission region could increase the suppression of the source flux above @xmath4  gev",
    ", it could hardly affect the flux at the energies below @xmath5  gev .",
    "indeed , s with energies @xmath6  gev could interact only with soft photons with energy @xmath7 $ ]  ev , which is much larger than the typical energy @xmath8 $ ]  ev of the thermal stellar photons with temperature @xmath9 .",
    "simple `` powerlaw modified by absorption '' model of the source spectrum is in contradiction with the observed orbital modulation of the signal in the 0.1 - 1  tev energy band . _",
    "fermi _ orbital lightcurve exhibits a pronounced maximum around @xmath10 .",

    "since the effect of @xmath3 pair production can not explain the cut - off at gev energies and the difference in the orbital modulation of the source flux at gev and tev energies , one has to consider a possibility that gev and tev s are produced via different mechanisms ( e.g. synchrotron and inverse compton ) and/or by different particle populations ( e.g. electrons and protons ) .",
    "[ lsi_synch ] , adopted from the ref .",
    "@xcite , shows two possible models of broad - band spectrum , consistent with _",
    "fermi _ data . in the upper panel",
    "the gev band emission is inverse compton emission from electron distribution with a high - energy cut - off at @xmath15 gev .",
    "alternatively , in the model shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ lsi_synch ] , the gev band emission is synchrotron emission from electron distribution extending to the energies @xmath16  gev ( see @xcite ) .    in the synchrotron model of gev emission , shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ lsi_synch ] , the electron injection spectrum has to be very hard @xcite .",
    "such hard electron spectrum could be produced if electrons are directly injected from relativistic pulsar wind @xcite or produced in interactions of high - energy protons @xcite .",
    "if high - energy electrons emitting gev synchrotron radiation are injected via interactions of high - energy protons , measurement of a cut - off energy of _ fermi _ spectrum @xmath17  gev @xcite imposes a constraint on the high - energy cut - off in the spectrum of the secondary @xmath18 pairs , @xmath19^{-1/2}\\left[e_{\\gamma , cut}/6\\mbox { gev}\\right]^{1/2}$ ]  ev , where @xmath20 is the magnetic field strength in the emission region .",
    "this , in turn , constrains the cut - off in the spectrum of primary protons , @xmath21^{-1/2}\\left[e_{\\gamma , cut}/6\\mbox { gev}\\right]^{1/2}\\mbox { pev}$ ] where @xmath22 is the typical inelasticity of @xmath23 collisions .",
    "pev protons do not interact efficiently with the uv photons from the be star , since the center of mass energy of proton - photon collisions is below the threshold of pion production @xmath24 $ ]  ev .",
    "therefore _ fermi _ data favor proton - proton hadronic models as compared to proton - photon interaction models , unless the magnetic field in the interaction region is at the level of @xmath25  g.    the synchrotron interpretation of the source spectrum in the kev - gev energy range enables to deduce the shape of the electron spectrum from the measured shape of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "this was done in the ref .",
    "@xcite in which it was found that the data are consistent with the assumption that @xmath18 pairs are initially injected with energies close to the high - energy cut - off . hard injection spectrum of @xmath18 pairs could be explained by the initial hard ( much harder than @xmath26 ) injection spectrum of protons ( e.g. injection from the proton - loaded relativistic wind with large bulk lorentz factor ) .",
    "the spectrum of neutrinos produced in interactions of high - energy protons is expected to be sharply peaked at the highest energies @xmath27^{-1/2}\\left[e_{\\gamma , cut}/6\\mbox { gev}\\right]^{1/2}$ ]  tev .",
    "neutrino flux is expected to be modulated on the orbital time scale .",
    "accounting for the orbital periodicity of the neutrino signal significantly increases the icecube potential for the detection of the source , once the validity of the model prediction is assumed .",
    "the resulting model - dependent approach in search for a neutrino signal is diametrically opposed to a random search for steady neutrino point source over the whole sky and complementary to a search for steady neutrino point source selected out of a catalogue  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino flux is not expected to be positively correlated with the tev emission , which is affected by the orbital phase dependent absorption in interactions with uv photons from be star ( see above ) .",
    "it is also not expected to be correlated with the gev band  emission , which might be strongly affected by development of electromagnetic cascade initiated by high - energy proton interactions .",
    "thus , neutrino lightcurve has to be calculated independently , rather than read out from photon lightcurve .",
    "pev protons are able to penetrate deep into ( or even through ) the dense equatorial disk of be star , because their larmor radius , @xmath28\\left[b/1\\mbox { g}\\right]^{-1}$ ]  cm , is comparable to the thickness of the disk .",
    "since proton trajectories are not randomized by the magnetic fields in the disk , the neutrino emission from the system is expected to be anisotropic , with the maximum flux emitted into a cone with the axis aligned with the compact object ",
    "be star direction @xcite .",
    "a neutrino signal could be detected if the neutrino emission cone passes through the line of sight , i.e. if the compact object is situated behind the dense equatorial disk of be star during a part of the orbit , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "we consider a disk which is truncated at the distance @xmath29 comparable to the binary separation of the star and compact object at the periastron @xcite .",
    "the span of the orbital phase period during which the compact object is situated behind the disk is maximized if the disk is oriented perpendicularly to the line of sight , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "for such a disk orientation , the result of calculation of the interval of orbital phases , during which the compact object is in the disk shadow ( i.e. , the interval during which neutrino signal from the source could be detected ) , is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : phase ] . for this calculation",
    ", we use the estimates of the orbital parameters of the system from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the interval of phases at which neutrino signal is expected , depends on the ( unknown ) inclination of the binary orbit .",
    "the width of the phase interval of neutrino emission increases with the increase of the disk size . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] we show the results of calculation of the phase intervals of neutrino emission for a range of disk sizes , from @xmath29 equal to the half of the binary separation distance at periastron @xmath30 to twice the binary separation at periastron .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the equatorial disk of be star in the  system is observed to periodically vary on super - orbital time scale of @xmath31  yr @xcite .",
    "this means that the orbital phase interval of neutrino emission is also expected to be modulated on the 4.6  yr time scale .",
    "the strongest neutrino signal ( corresponding to the largest span of the neutrino emission phase interval ) is expected when the equatorial disk expands to its maximal size , roughly once in each 4.6  yr cycle .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] that , independently of the disk size and inclination of the orbit , the phase interval of neutrino emission from the source is @xmath32 .",
    "if this neutrino emission model within a reduced time window closely matches the actual source neutrino emission , the sensitivity of a neutrino telescope for the detection of the source is increased due to ( 1 ) an atmospheric neutrino reduction by a factor @xmath33 and ( 2 ) beyond a free phase variability fit due to the constraint of the phase of the neutrino emission .",
    "is the only  loud binary system for which the nature of the compact object and the source of the power are certain .",
    "it is clear that ( unpulsed ) radio - to - tev emission from the system is generated in collision of relativistic pulsar wind with the dense equatorial wind of be star .",
    "the line of intersection of the disk plane and the orbital plane is tilted at about @xmath34  with respect to the major axis of the binary orbit , so that the pulsar passes through the disk twice per orbit .",
    "episodes of pulsar passage through the disk are associated with pronounced flares of the source , visible in radio , x - ray and tev  bands @xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of lsi + 61 303 , physical mechanism through which x - ray to  emission from the source is produced ( synchrotron or inverse compton ) , is not well constrained @xcite .",
    "in fact , spectral and timing characteristics of the source could be successfully reproduced in both models , see fig .",
    "[ models ] .    from fig .",
    "[ models ] it is clear that _ fermi _ observations of the next flaring period of the source during 2010 periastron passage will clarify the mechanism of x - ray - to-  emission .",
    "predictions of the two models significantly differ in the two cases .",
    "if the x - ray-  emission is dominated by inverse compton emission from single population of electrons , the source should be detected by _",
    "fermi _ during the several month - long flare around the periastron .",
    "the source spectrum is expected to be a powerlaw . at the same time",
    ", the source could remain below _ fermi _ sensitivity level if the the x - ray emission is dominated by synchrotron .",
    "the cut - off energy of the synchrotron spectrum is not currently constrained by the available data .",
    "if the energies of electrons accelerated at the interface of pulsar and stellar wind ( or injected directly from the pulsar wind ) reach @xmath35  tev energies ( similarly to the case of ) , the high - energy cut - off of the synchrotron spectrum might be revealed by _",
    "we discussed the results of _ fermi _ observations of grlbs .",
    "we found that _ fermi _ data significantly constrain the mechanisms of  emission from  and enable to work out firm predictions for the expected neutrino signal from the source in the framework of hadronic models of source activity .",
