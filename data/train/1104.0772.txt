    "quantum nonlocality in quantum mechanics ( qm ) manifests when combining quantum entanglement of two or more parties with quantum measurement on one of these parties . in the simplest scenario a quantum measurement",
    "_ locally _ ( in a subspace of the full hilbert space ) on one party of an entangled pair ( say , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) will lead to an instantaneous projection or collapse of the quantum state of both parties such that the other party is also affected .",
    "the situation becomes more intriguing if we add the assumption that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are local in position space and they are separated at a distance .",
    "then the quantum state of @xmath1 will be projected instantaneously by a local measurement on @xmath0 , no matter how far @xmath1 is away from @xmath0 @xcite . while this appears to have some kind of superluminal signal",
    ", causality will not be violated since no meaningful information can be communicated using such an instantaneous wavefunction collapse .",
    "aharonov and albert have further shown that indirect measurement on quantum objects localized in space and time is consistent with relativistic qm @xcite , where the measurement process has no covariant description in terms of the time evolution of quantum states @xcite and quantum states make sense only within a given frame .",
    "nevertheless , local quantum objects such as atoms or charged particles are inevitably coupled with quantum fields defined on the whole spacelike hypersurface ( the time - slice ) and evolving in time as the environment .",
    "if a relativistic quantum field is involved in the system that we are looking at , will the above scenario of wavefunction collapse still be consistent ?",
    "or more generally , is instantaneous wavefunction collapse in a projective measurement local in position space consistent with relativistic quantum field theory ( rqft ) ?",
    "rqft is very powerful in solving the scattering problem . in particle colliders , measurements on an ensemble of particles",
    "are done in the huge detectors surrounding the collision point , effectively in the future asymptotic region .",
    "so it is sufficient to calculate the scattering amplitude between the in- and out - states defined in past infinity and future infinity , respectively , where all particles are free .",
    "this is called the  in - out \" formalism , which gives the statistics of the outgoing particles against the incoming particles @xcite .",
    "our questions raised here , however , concern the _ single - shot _ projective measurements on a quantum field at some moment _ in the interaction region _ rather than in the asymptotic region .",
    "so we have to go beyond the  in - out \" formalism to answer our questions .",
    "one is tempted to generalize the indirect measurement scheme in @xcite to rqft to study this issue .",
    "nevertheless , there each indirect measurement process is modeled by an interaction localized in space and time between a quantum probe and the fields , and the projective measurements on the quantum probes are still performed in the future asymptotic region ( more discussion will be given in appendix a ) , while the wavefunction collapse we are looking at is not described by any interaction hamiltonian .",
    "thus we turn to the standard schrdinger picture of rqft to watch the discontinuous and continuous evolutions of the whole system @xcite , whose quantum state at each moment is represented as the wavefunctional of the fields ( and the sources , if any ) living on the whole associated time - slice . in this formalism",
    "one needs to specify an initial state on the time - slice associated with some non - infinity initial moment in some coordinate where the hamiltonian is defined ( we assume that it is always possible to prepare such an initial state ) , then the schrdinger equation will give the continuous evolution of the quantum state from the initial moment and between the events of the projective measurement .",
    "suppose the postulate of the projective measurement in qm can be extended to rqft , then the wavefunctional of the fields on the whole time - slice would be collapsed by a measurement local in position space if the relevant degrees of freedom have nonzero correlations .",
    "since the dynamical variables of quantum fields can be nonlocal in position space or separable in a quantum state , such a scenario of local measurement must be carefully formulated .",
    "one simple way to achieve this is by going back to the atom - field interacting system : to measure an unruh - dewitt detector @xcite or similar object locally coupled with quantum fields @xcite , analogous to an optical system with a photodiode coupled to em field , as is described in our setup .",
    "below we are looking at , but not limited to , a detector model similar to the unruh - dewitt detector theory . before getting into detailed calculation , in section",
    "ii we give an alternative frame in minkowski space to make our discussion more economic and precise .",
    "then in section iii we introduce the raine - sciama - grove detector theory in ( 1 + 1)d minkowski space as our toy model .",
    "we perform explicit calculations for one - detector and two - detector cases in sections iv and v , respectively , then the results will be summarized in section vi .",
    "finally , we compare our model with those in the indirect measurement scheme in appendix a , and apply an argument similar to that for our linear toy model to nonlinear detector - field models in appendix b.",
    "it has been shown by aharonov and albert that , in relativistic qm , quantum states _ in the non - asymptotic region _ defined on two different time - slices intersecting at some spacetime points could be very different even for the sectors of the dynamical variables defined right on the intersections of the two time - slices @xcite .",
    "thus in the interaction region one can compare two wavefunctionals of a field defined in two different frames only if the whole time - slices that they are living on are exactly the same .",
    "moreover , since the initial state of the detector - field system must be specified on the whole fiducial time - slice associated with the initial moment , if this was done by an observer at rest in minkowski space but not in past infinity , for an observer moving with constant velocity the initial data far enough from the detectors will appear to be specified at some times _ after _ the measurement event on the detector when the wavefunctional was collapsed ( figure [ nucoord ] ( left ) ) .",
    "to avoid this situation and make the quantum states comparable , we have to go beyond the linear lorentz transformation and inertial frames .    a good example of the reference frame for our discussion is the following alternative coordinates in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional minkowski space , @xmath2 with constant @xmath3",

    "those moments , @xmath11-slices are the wavy ones in figure [ nucoord ] ( right ) , where @xmath12-slices would be the horizontal straight lines .    now the questions can be put more precisely .",

    "disi pointed out that in this case it would be simpler to describe such processes using heisenberg operators , which are naturally covariant in a relativistic model @xcite . in our model @xmath218 and other linear detector theories ,",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "a quantum state in the schrdinger picture for our model is represented as a wavefunctional consisting of the dynamical variables ( @xmath37 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 , or equivalently , @xmath222 and @xmath223 in @xmath69 in the @xmath181-representation ) and the time - dependent factors .",

    "the evolutions of the operators corresponding to the dynamical variables local in position space , such as @xmath37 and @xmath219 living inside the pointlike detectors , are naturally parameterized by their own proper times , like those in @xmath96 .",
    "suppose the time evolutions of all the operators have been solved . in a given reference frame",
    "started with some initial time - slice , the quantum state on a time - slice associated with some moment in this frame is obtained by inserting the operators for the dynamical variables on that time - slice into the correlators composing the time - dependent factors in the wavefunctional . for the dynamical variables local in position space ( @xmath37 , @xmath219 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 ) those operators are the ones with their own proper times or coordinate times at the intersections of their world lines and the time - slice that the correlators are evaluated on .",
    "different frames have different time - slicing schemes , so the histories of the wavefunctionals in different frames can be very different , though the history of each operator corresponding to a spatially local dynamical variable is uniquely determined by the covariant heisenberg equations of motion @xcite .",
    "note that the above argument is not restricted to just the indirect measurement scheme , but is valid for all relativistic systems with well defined hamiltonians without any projective measurement between the initial and final time - slices .",
    "the only thing special to the indirect measurement scheme is that all the couplings will eventually be turned off , then a set of the projective measurements will be performed on the quantum probes or devices on some final time - slice in the future asymptotic region .",
    "it is obvious that , if the covariant interaction hamiltonians describing two individual local  measurement events \" ( entanglement processes , actually ) in the indirect measurement scheme commute , then the time order of these events being possibly different in different frames will not matter and the quantum states will be consistent when compared on _ the same _ final time - slice in different frames in the future asymptotic region @xcite .",
    "this is guaranteed by the covariance of the operator histories and the form - invariance of the time - dependent factors in terms of the correlators in a quantum state never being projected .",
    "if there is a projective measurement performed at some moment during the evolution of a detector - field system in the interaction region , however , the dependence on the correlators of the time - dependent factors in the wavefunctional of the whole detector - field system will be suddenly changed like @xmath176 , so the argument in this subsection will not be valid .",
    "suppose each quantum device in the indirect measurement scheme is associated with a pointlike object in space so that the dynamics of the device can be parameterized in its proper time , which is invariant under coordinate transformations .",
