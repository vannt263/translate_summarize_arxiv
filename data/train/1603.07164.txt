    "let @xmath2 be a bounded domain with smooth boundary @xmath3 .",
    "for any given @xmath4 , we consider for @xmath5 the evolution equation arising in the theory of uniaxial deformations in isothermal viscoelasticity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath6 subject to the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition @xmath7 the unknown variable @xmath8 describes the _ axial displacement field _ relative to the reference configuration of a viscoelastic body occupying the volume @xmath9 at rest , and is interpreted as an initial datum for @xmath10 , where it need not solve the equation . here , @xmath11 is a nonlinear term , @xmath12 an external force , and the convolution ( or memory ) kernel @xmath13 is a function of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a ( nonnegative ) convex summable function .",
    "the values @xmath16 represent the _ instantaneous elastic modulus _ , and the _ relaxation modulus _ of the material , respectively .",
    "since @xmath17 , a formal integration by parts yields @xmath18 so that can be rewritten as @xmath19    a simplified , yet very effective , way to represent linear viscoelastic materials is through rheological models , that is , by considering combinations of linear elastic springs and viscous dashpots . in particular ,",
    "a standard viscoelastic solid is modeled as a maxwell element , i.e.  a hookean spring and a newtonian dashpot sequentially connected , which is in parallel with a lone spring .",
    "the resulting memory kernel turns out to be of exponential type . in this context",
    ", the aging of the material corresponds to a change of the physical parameters along the time leading , possibly , to a different shape of the memory kernel .",
    "there are several ways to reproduce this phenomenon within a rheological framework ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . here",
    ", we propose to describe aging as a deterioration of the elastic response of the viscoelastic solid , translating into a progressive stiffening of the spring in the maxwell element . in the limiting situation ,",
    "when the spring becomes completely rigid , the outcome is the kelvin - voigt ( solid ) model , depicted by a damper and an elastic spring connected in parallel .",
    "mathematically speaking , the kelvin - voigt model can be obtained from by keeping fixed the total mass of the kernel @xmath15 , that is , @xmath20 and letting @xmath21 . or , in other words , by taking the  limit \" @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dirac mass at @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to the equation @xmath25 in the terminology of dautray and lions @xcite , this is the passage from viscoelasticity with _ long memory _ to viscoelasticity with _ short memory_.    in spite of a relatively vast literature concerning both and ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein )",
    ", we are not aware of analytic studies which consider the possibility of including aging phenomena ( or , more generally , changes of the structural properties ) of the material _ within _ the dynamics .",
    "thus , from our point of view , it is of great interest to have a model whose physical parameters can evolve over time .",
    "this would allow , for instance , to describe the transition from long to short memory of a given viscoelastic material .",
    "the way to pursue this goal is to let the memory kernel @xmath13 depend itself on time .",
    "accordingly , we will consider a modified version of , namely , @xmath26 subject to the boundary condition , with @xmath27 where the time - dependent function @xmath28 is convex and summable for every fixed @xmath29 . here and in",
    "what follows , the _ prime _ denotes the partial derivative with respect to @xmath30 .",
    "it is worth noting that the nonautonomous character of   is structural , in the sense that the leading differential operator depends explicitly on time . a much different situation than , say , having a time - dependent external force .",
    "the equation is supplemented with the initial conditions @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and the function @xmath34 are assigned data .    in order to study the initial - boundary value problem above , following the pioneering idea of dafermos @xcite",
    "we introduce for @xmath35 the _ past history _",
    "variable @xmath36 besides , aiming to incorporate the boundary conditions , we consider the strictly positive linear operator @xmath37 on the hilbert space @xmath38 of square summable functions on @xmath9 , with domain @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the usual sobolev spaces . then",
    ", calling @xmath42 and setting for simplicity the constant @xmath43 , problem with the dirichlet boundary condition reads @xmath44 denoting @xmath45 in view of it is readily seen that , for every @xmath35 , @xmath46 accordingly , viewing the original problem as the evolution system - in the variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the initial conditions turn into @xmath49    the focus of this paper is a global well - posedness result for problem - in a suitable functional space . from the mathematical point of view , the presence of a time - dependent kernel introduces essential difficulties , and new ideas are needed .",
    "indeed , in the classical dafermos scheme , one has a supplementary differential equation ruling the evolution of the variable @xmath50 , generated by the right - translation semigroup on the history space , whose mild solution is given by  .",
    "but in our case , the natural phase space for the past history is itself time - dependent , suggesting that the right strategy is to work within the theory of processes on time - dependent spaces @xmath51 , recently devised by di plinio _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and further developed in @xcite .",
    "still , in those papers the time dependence entered only via the definition of the norm in a universal reference space , i.e.  the spaces @xmath51 are in fact the _ same _ linear space endowed with different norms , all equivalent for @xmath29 running in compact sets . on the contrary , here the phase space",
    "@xmath51 depends on time at a _ geometric _ level , and we only have a set inclusion @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "this poses some problems even in the definition of the time derivative @xmath54 . to overcome this obstacle",
    ", we propose a different notion of solution ( which boils down to the usual one when the memory kernel is time - independent ) , where the evolution of @xmath50 is actually postulated via the representation formula  . at the same time , this prevents us to obtain directly differential inequalities , essential to produce any kind of energy estimates , so that the main technical tool in our approach turns out to be a family of integral inequalities , which are obtained by several approximation steps .",
    "the theory , along with the techniques developed in this work , open the way to the longterm analysis of the solutions , which will be the object of future works . besides , a paradigm is set in order to tackle any equation of memory type with time - dependent kernels .",
    "it is worth mentioning also the possibility of extending in a quite natural way the underlying ideas to the study of systems with memory in the so - called minimal state framework introduced in  @xcite .      in section 2",
    "we stipulate our assumptions on the time - dependent memory kernel , showing a concrete example of physical relevance , while in section 3 we introduce the proper functional spaces .",
    "the global well - posedness result is stated in section 4 .",
    "the main technical tool needed in our analysis is discussed in section 5 , and the remaining of the paper is devoted to the proofs : existence of solutions ( section 6 ) , uniqueness ( section 7 ) and further regularity ( section 8) . in the final appendix we provide a physical derivation of our equation via a rheological model for aging materials .      for @xmath55",
    ", we define the compactly nested hilbert spaces @xmath56 endowed with the inner products and norms @xmath57 the index @xmath58 will be always omitted when equal to zero . for @xmath59 , it is understood that @xmath60 denotes the completion of the domain , so that @xmath60 is the dual space of @xmath61 .",
    "the symbol @xmath62 will also be used to denote the duality pairing between @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in particular , @xmath63 along the paper , we will repeatedly use without explicit mention the young , hlder and poincar inequalities , as well as the standard sobolev embeddings , e.g.   @xmath64 .",
    "in order to prove a well - posedness result for our problem , we suppose that the function @xmath65 satisfies the following set of assumptions , where @xmath66 and we agree to denote @xmath67 whenever such derivatives exist .    * for every fixed @xmath68 , the map @xmath69 is nonincreasing , absolutely continuous and summable . * for every @xmath70 there exists a function @xmath71 , summable on any interval @xmath72 $ ] , such that @xmath73 for every @xmath74 and every @xmath75 . * for almost every fixed @xmath75 , the map @xmath76 is differentiable for all @xmath68 . besides , @xmath77 for every compact set @xmath78 .",

    "we readily see that @xmath84    in this work we are mainly concerned with kernels that do not vanish on @xmath85 , modeling the so - called infinite delay case .",
