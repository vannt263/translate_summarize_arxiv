    ", i will here consider the case where , at the initial time , these particles form a compact cluster centered at the origin ; the solution for an arbitrary initial condition has been given in ref @xcite , using the reflection principle .",
    "in addition , as contrasted to the standard model in which all the particles have the same diffusion constant @xmath1 , it is here assumed that the particle @xmath13 has a random @xmath14 , chosen independently of all the others in a given distribution law @xmath2 .",
    "the latter can always be written as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes a specific value of the diffusion constant ( _ e .",
    "g. _ the average value ) and @xmath17 a positive function normalized to unity : @xmath18 on a physical level , a random diffusion constant @xmath1 can arise in various ways .",
    "for instance , by stokes law and einstein relation , it can result from a random radius ; more directly , this also happens for particles having random masses .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to analyze how the choice of the distribution @xmath19 modifies the large-@xmath0 dependence of the transport coefficients for one particle of the cluster and , more generally , to find out the density probability of its coordinate in the presence of random diffusion constants .",
    "more specifically , focus will be given on edge particles and on the one which ( for @xmath0 odd ) is at the middle of the cluster ; for the `` pure '' case ( all the particles have the same @xmath1 ) , asymptotic laws ( @xmath20 ) have been given in ref . @xcite .",
    "among other results , it was shown that increasing @xmath0 yields a narrowing of the one particle - probability distributions , as a result of the `` pressure '' exerted by other particles on a given one .",
    "this will be shown not to be true in all cases when the @xmath1 s are randomly sampled . as a rule ,",
    "if the middle particle is most often insensitive to disorder  provided that the average @xmath6 exists and is finite  it will be shown that the distribution for the side particles strongly depends on the latter , going from narrow to broad laws .",

    "when all the particles have the same diffusion constant , one has @xcite : @xmath81    as contrasted , for exponentially distributed random @xmath1 , the anomalous drift coefficient increases like @xmath82 , whereas the effective diffusion constant @xmath83 tends towards a _ finite _ ( non - vanishing ) value .",
    "also note that the height of the maximum also saturates and does not go to zero for @xmath0 infinite . as a whole ,",
    "the effect of an exponential disorder is rather subbtle : most particles of the cluster have a rather small @xmath1 , so that the pressure they exert on the edge ones is smaller than in the pure case ; on the other hand , large @xmath1 forces the packet to more with a `` velocity '' which increases more rapidly with @xmath0 than in the pure case .",
    "the interplay of these facts produces a distribution having a finite height and width at infinite @xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",

    "@xmath98 can be found by using ( [ p21nexpl ] ) and ( [ frhoexp ] ) ; for @xmath20 , a little algebra yields : @xmath100      \\label{correxp}\\enspace.\\ ] ] by ( [ dx2exp ] ) , this implies that the normalized ratio @xmath101  which is constant in time  has a logarithmic increase with @xmath0 : @xmath102 although the numerator and the denominator of the ratio have separately different behaviours as compared to the pure case , the ratio still has a @xmath103 increase with @xmath0 , exactly as in this latter case@xcite .    for the particle located at the middle of the cluster , the expression ( [ pmiddle1 ] ) writes : @xmath104 from ( [ pmiddle1exp ] ) , the following large-@xmath0 expression of the mean square dispersion is obtained : @xmath105      \\label{dmiddleexp}\\enspace,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 denotes the euler beta - function @xcite .",
    "expansion for large-@xmath0 yields : @xmath107 and provides the asymptotic dependence of the diffusion constant : @xmath108 this behaviour is the same as for the pure case@xcite .",
    "thus , for the exponential distribution , the transport coefficient of the central particle is essentially unaltered by disorder  as shown below this is also true for any @xmath19 density having @xmath6 finite .",
    "the asymptotic density of the middle particle is obtained from ( [ pmiddle1exp ] ) as the following : @xmath109 this function is normalized to unity up to @xmath5 terms .",
    "apart from the cusp at @xmath110 and outside the region @xmath111 , this is essentially a gaussian distribution , exactly as in the pure case . for large @xmath0",
    ", the cusp can even be ignored and the distribution looks like a gaussian everywhere .",
    "in fact , it can now be stated the conditions for the stochastic dynamics of the central particle to be unaffected by disorder ; such a particle is stymied in some way due to other particles and it can be suspected that strong steric effects most often dominate , except perhaps when the distribution @xmath2 gives a high probability to find very small @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis goes as follows . for @xmath20",
    ", it is readily seen that the distribution ( [ p1middle ] ) assumes non - negligible values only for @xmath112 .",
    "this in turn allows to replace @xmath40 by its small-@xmath113 expansion ; from ( [ iu ] ) and ( [ gaussmoyen ] ) , @xmath114 exists and is finite provided that @xmath2 is bounded by @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) for @xmath117 .",
    "this means that when @xmath4 diverges at small @xmath1 , this divergence is not too severe , which implies that finding a small @xmath1 has not such a great probability . with this assumption",

    "the opposite case is treated in the next section which deals with the gamma - distribution .",
    "as another example  which in fact contains the exponential distribution as a particular case  let us choose a gamma distribution : @xmath125 with ( [ rhodgamma ] ) , the expectation values of @xmath1 and @xmath126 are respectively equal to @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "the large-@xmath0 asymptotic laws all belong to the same class for gamma - distributed diffusion constants , the behaviours being rather easily obtained by considering the simpler exponential case @xmath153 ; the same obviously holds for statistical correlations between edge particles .    for the central particle",

    "one has : @xmath155 this in turns entails that : @xmath156 as a consequence , one obtains : @xmath157    this shows that when the probability is very high to find quite small diffusion constants , the distribution for the central particle diverges at @xmath158 ( but is clearly integrable ) and is essentially a stretched exponential when @xmath159 is large : @xmath160 for @xmath161 , @xmath162 is proportionnal to the bessel function @xmath163 and the divergence is logarithmic . in this case , one has : @xmath164 which entails : @xmath165 the divergence at @xmath140 comes from the interplay of pressure and of the frequent occurrence of central particle with a very small @xmath1 . from ( [ p1midgamas ] ) , one finds : @xmath166^{1/\\alpha}\\ ,      \\frac{\\gamma(\\frac{1}{\\alpha})}{\\gamma(\\frac{1}{2\\alpha})}\\,\\left(\\frac{2n}{\\pi } \\right)^{-\\frac{1}{2\\alpha}}\\,d_{0}t      \\label{x2gamas}\\enspace.\\ ] ]    summing up , the effective diffusion constant for the central particle and for the gamma distribution scales with @xmath0 as follows : @xmath167 with : @xmath168",
    "the two previously examples discard the interesting case in which the diffusion constants are sampled in a broad law , possibly devoid of usual first few moments ( mean and variance ) .",
    "obviously enough , such a case is interesting since the average front for the edge particles are expected to be strongly asymmetric and also quite diffuse , due to the pressure exerted by inner particles and the possibility of rather high diffusion contants .",
    "this fact even opens the possibility for the edge particules to be also distributed according a broad law , devoid of mean and variance .",
    "generally speaking , i will now consider the case : @xmath169 all the moments @xmath170 diverge for @xmath171 .    with the distribution ( [ rhodbroad ] )",
    ", the @xmath34 function ( [ gaussmoyen ] ) can be expressed in terms of the incomplete @xmath172 function @xcite : @xmath173 again , i am interested in the large-@xmath0 limit , in which case the right particle density ( [ p1edge ] ) assumes non - negligible values for @xmath113 of the order of or greater than @xmath174 defined as : @xmath175^{n}\\ , = \\,\\frac{1}{2}\\hspace{5 mm }      \\longleftrightarrow\\hspace{5mm}u_{0}\\,\\simeq\\,\\left[\\frac{n}{\\pi^{1/2}\\,\\ln      4 } \\,\\gamma(\\mu+\\case12)\\right]^{\\,1/(2\\mu ) }      \\label{defu0 }      \\enspace.\\ ] ] for genuine broad laws ( @xmath176 small ) , @xmath174 is much greater than 1 even for moderately large values of @xmath0 .",
    "this allows to state again that the large-@xmath113 expansion of @xmath40 is only relevant , and to substitute everywhere the approximate expression : @xmath177 injecting this in ( [ p1edge ] ) yields the large-@xmath0 approximation , valid for @xmath178 : @xmath179 it being understood that @xmath180 is exponentially small for @xmath181 and can be considered as identically vanishing for @xmath181 ; note that the expression ( [ pnedgebroadas ] ) goes toward zero extremely rapidely when @xmath182 , namely : @xmath183 on the other hand , this distribution is indeed a broad law in the wide sense , since ( [ pnedgebroadas ] ) displays for any @xmath176 a power - law behaviour at ( very ) large @xmath113 : @xmath184 eqs .",
