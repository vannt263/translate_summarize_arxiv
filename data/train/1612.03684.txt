    "it turns out that these bridges , as well as any elastic plate modeled by , display two kinds of oscillations : the longitudinal and the torsional ones . in section [ longtors ]",
    "we emphasize their classification and the corresponding shapes of oscillations ( the related eigenfunctions , that is , the normal modes ) .",
    "we also compute numerically some of the eigenvalues .",
    "there is a growing interest of engineers on the shape optimization for the design of bridges and , in particular , on the sensitivity analysis of certain eigenvalue problems , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "as pointed out by banerjee @xcite , _ the free vibration analysis is a fundamental pre - requisite before carrying out a flutter analysis_. whence , since the eigenvalues of are the squared frequencies of the normal modes of @xmath0 , in order to improve the stability of the plate one has to analyze the behavior of the eigenvalues with respect to perturbations of the domain @xmath0 ; since we have in mind the application to bridges , we can not vary the two short edges of the plate and , therefore , we will consider domain variations which do not preserve its area .",
    "classical references for the behavior of the eigenvalues of an elliptic operator under domain perturbation are @xcite . in theorem [ implicitfunction ]",
    "we establish the explicit formula for the derivatives of the eigenvalues when the perturbation of @xmath0 merely consists in varying its width @xmath2 ; in fact , for later use , we prove a result allowing to compute the derivative of any smooth function depending on couples of eigenvalues . concerning shape deformations leading to geometries different from a rectangle ,",
    "a major difficulty for problem is that it is a fourth order equation and this fact usually yields very complicated formulas for the derivatives of the eigenvalues , in particular the boundary condition is very delicate : in theorem [ duesetted ] we overcome this difficulty by taking advantage of recent results obtained in his doctoral dissertation by the second author @xcite .",
    "then we apply these results to a stability problem .",
    "the most dangerous oscillations for the deck of a bridge , leading to fractures and collapses , are the torsional ones and the target of engineers is to find possible ways to prevent their appearance ; we refer to section [ thresholds ] for detailed explanations .",
    "we investigate the possibility of defining a domain functional able to quantify how much a plate is prone to transform longitudinal oscillations into torsional ones .",
    "such a functional should depend on the particular couple of ( longitudinal , torsional ) modes considered , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.5 ) .    together with some colleagues , the first and the third author made several attempts to mathematically describe the torsional instability for different bridge models , see @xcite and also @xcite for a survey of the available results .",
    "the conclusion of these works is that the instability depends not only on the couple of torsional and longitudinal frequencies involved but also on the amount of energy present within the structure .",
    "this result is reached by studying some second order 2-dof hamiltonian systems that naturally arise while approximating the pde modeling the dynamics of the deck .",
    "for this reason , in section [ criticalenergy ] we study some prototype hamiltonian systems and we compute their energy thresholds for stability . as far as we are aware , there is no similar systematic study in literature .",
    "it turns out that the energy threshold is very sensitive to the ( nonlinear ) coupling terms and it appears very hard to derive a general rule .",
    "however , the studied hamiltonian systems also share a common feature : their energy threshold only depends on the _ ratio _ of the two frequencies considered .    in section [ nostro ] , we combine the above facts with some `` axioms '' from the engineering literature ,",
    "that is , some fundamental properties that are to be expected from bridges and that are obtained either from experimental tests or from actual bridges .",
    "then , by exploiting the explicit form of the shape derivatives previously found in section [ dompert ] , we investigate whether some shape functionals fit the obtained requirements .",
    "these functionals do not simply depend on the eigenvalues but also on the shape of the domain : in these situations , the analysis usually requires a suitable combination of variational methods from shape optimization and numerical methods , see e.g.  @xcite for some examples .",
    "we show that some of these functionals partially fulfill the basic rules of a shape functional aiming to compute the energy threshold for the torsional stability . but none of these functionals works for all the couples of ( longitudinal , torsional ) eigenvalues .",
    "our conclusion is that there exists no general and simple shape functional obeying all these rules and able to measure the stability of bridges .    in section [ flutter ]",
    "we quickly survey a part of the engineering literature where one can find some attempts to derive thresholds for the stability of the deck . by applying again theorems [ implicitfunction ] and [ duesetted ] , we show that also the most popular formula used to compute the energy threshold does not satisfy the fundamental properties observed in actual bridges",

    "several other bridges collapsed for the same reason , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1 ) or the introduction in @xcite .",
    "hence , the most dangerous oscillations , leading to fractures and collapses , are the torsional ones and a common target of engineers is to find possible ways to prevent their appearance in the deck . our purpose in this second part of the paper is to discuss the possibility of finding a domain functional able to quantify how much a plate is prone to transform longitudinal oscillations into torsional ones . to this end",
    ", we need to review some rules that a deck is known to obey , starting from the aerodynamic mechanism generating oscillations .",
    "when the wind hits the deck of a bridge the direction of the flow is modified and goes around the body . behind the deck , or a corner of it",

    "this asymmetry generates a forcing lift which launches the vertical oscillations of the deck . up to some minor details ,",
    "this explanation is shared by the whole community and has been studied with great precision in wind tunnel tests , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "inspired by previous results by bleich @xcite , rocard @xcite shows that for common bridges there exists a threshold for the velocity of the wind ( that we denote by @xmath89 ) above which the bridge undergoes to _ flutter _ , namely a form of instability which is visible in many objects and appears as an uncontrolled vibration , see the videos @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the vortices induced by the wind increase the internal energy of the structure and generate wide longitudinal oscillations which look periodic in time and are maintained in amplitude by a somehow perfect equilibrium between the input of energy from the wind and internal dissipation : at this point , one may assume that the deck is isolated .",
    "then one wonders how the longitudinal oscillations may transform into torsional ones .",
    "recent results in @xcite show that the transition is due to some internal resonance , a phenomenon typical of ( conservative ) hamiltonian systems , see @xcite .",
    "this resonance appears in nonlinear systems and depends on the amount of energy inside the system : when an energy threshold ( that we denote by @xmath90 ) is reached , there is a sudden transfer of energy between the different components of the hamiltonian system . for bridges",
    "this translates into the possible appearance of wide torsional oscillations from an apparently pure longitudinal oscillation .",
    "in fact , the thresholds for flutter and for internal resonance are linked by the well - known formula for the kinetic energy e_c = k v_c^2  , for some @xmath91 depending on the air density .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a clear explanation of the relationship between flutter and internal resonance .",
    "the main idea for computing the energy threshold @xmath90 is as follows .",

    "well - posedness for this problem is proved in @xcite by using the galerkin method , that is , an approximation of involving a finite number of modes . by restricting the attention to a couple of ( longitudinal , torsional ) modes",

    "we also refer to @xcite for stability results for a nonlinear nonlocal beam equation .",
    "a much more difficult case appears to be that involving local terms , although recent attempts in @xcite show that , at least with suitable truncations and approximations , this seems to be possible : it was found there that if the total energy overcomes a threshold @xmath99 that can be computed numerically , then there is a transfer of energy from @xmath95 to @xmath54 , that is , the amplitude of the torsional component suddenly grows up .",
    "this phenomenon is related to the theory of normal forms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and has sound explanations through the floquet theory and poincar maps ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    since the `` exact and explicit '' form of @xmath92 in is not known due to the extreme complexity of the mechanical system , in the next section we consider some `` toy models '' from which we derive a general rule for , independently of @xmath94 .",

    "* v-10 ) witnessed the collapse and wrote that _ the motions , which a moment before had involved a number of waves ( nine or ten ) had shifted almost instantly to two_. this means that the instability occurred from the ninth or tenth longitudinal mode to the second torsional one .",
    "smith and vincent @xcite state that this shape of torsional oscillations is the only possible one , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 1.6 ) for further evidence and more historical facts . for these reasons ,",
    "the eigenvalues in appear more than enough for a reliable stability analysis .",
    "on the other hand , from ( * ? ? ? * section 2.5 ) we learn that the flutter speed @xmath89 of a bridge depends on the couple of modes considered .",
    "all this suggests to study the torsional stability of the plate for several ( but not all ) couples of ( longitudinal , torsional ) normal modes . when the parameters are fixed according to the tacoma narrows bridge data , see , the most interesting ones are @xmath366 for @xmath177 since they correspond to low frequencies , they satisfy @xmath367 , and they involve the second torsional mode .    in this paper we have generalized the definition of critical energy ( or flutter velocity ) , see formula , in order to make it also usable for plates having shapes other than rectangular , see .",
    "then we discovered several rules that the critical energy of a couple of ( longitudinal , torsional ) eigenvalues is supposed to satisfy : these are summarized in , , , and .",
    "nevertheless , the empirical formula shows that these suggestions can not be simultaneously satisfied . from section [ flutter ]",
    "we learn that a fully accepted way to compute the flutter velocity is not available and that the most popular formula coming from engineering literature is not reliable . clearly , a formula able to quantify the torsional stability of a deck would be very important for the safety of bridges and any progress in this direction would be extremely welcome .",
    "but our conclusion is that it can not be found in an explicit and simple form .",
    "finally , let us mention a related challenging problem .",
    "the deck of a bridge is often strengthened with stiffening trusses @xcite .",
    "it would be of great interest to study the variation of the frequencies of oscillations in presence of trusses . in this respect",
    ", the framework could be that of michell trusses @xcite , see also @xcite for a first naif attempt .",
