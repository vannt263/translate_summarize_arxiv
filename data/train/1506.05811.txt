    "a number of experimental anomalies consistent with neutrino oscillations at a characteristic mass splitting around 1  ev@xmath4 hint at the possibility of an additional neutrino .",
    "these anomalies fall into two categories : muon - to - electron flavor appearance , as observed by the lsnd  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite experiments , and electron flavor disappearance , as observed by reactor  @xcite and source  @xcite experiments .",
    "a favored beyond - standard - model explanation for these anomalies invokes an additional number of @xmath5 sterile neutrinos participating in oscillations beyond the three active flavors  @xcite .",
    "these `` 3+@xmath5 models '' are able to simultaneously describe the existing anomalous observations and those measurements which do not claim a signal in the relevant parameter space  @xcite , although there is tension between both neutrino and antineutrino measurements and appearance and disappearance measurements .",
    "muon neutrinos , for example , must disappear if the observed anomalies are due to oscillations involving a light sterile neutrino .",
    "the lack of observed @xmath1 disappearance is a major source of tension in the global fits . in order to understand the importance of @xmath1 disappearance measurements , consider a 3 + 1 sterile neutrino model , with the probability for @xmath6 appearance given by : @xmath7 the probability for @xmath8 and @xmath1 disappearance are , respectively : @xmath9 and @xmath10 in these equations , the elements of the mixing matrix , @xmath11 , set the amplitude of oscillation , while @xmath12 establishes the oscillation wavelength . within this 3 + 1 model , a global fit to the world s data , including all anomalies and null results , will simultaneously constrain @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the range of values that @xmath14 can take on , and therefore the oscillation parameters that govern @xmath1 disappearance , can thus be restricted .",
    "the present global fit for @xmath1 disappearance places the allowed region just outside of current bounds .",
    "this motivates the construction of a fast , low cost , and decisive @xmath1 disappearance experiment that can confirm or disallow various models for sterile neutrinos , as well as inform a range of future proposed experiments @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we describe such an experiment , called  kpipe \" , that can perform a search for @xmath1 disappearance that extends well beyond current limits while still being low cost .",
    "kpipe will employ a long , liquid scintillator - based detector that is oriented radially with respect to an intense source of isotropic monoenergetic 236  mev @xmath1s coming from the decay - at - rest of positively charged kaons ( @xmath15 ; br=63.55@xmath160.11%  @xcite ) . as the only relevant monoenergetic neutrino that can interact via the charged current interaction , a kaon decay - at - rest ( kdar ) @xmath17 source represents a unique and important tool for precision oscillation , cross section , and nuclear physics measurements  @xcite .",
    "since the energy of these neutrinos is known , indications of @xmath17 disappearance may be seen along the length of the kpipe detector as oscillating deviations from the expected 1/@xmath18 dependence in the rate of @xmath17 charged - current ( cc ) interactions .",
    "a measurement of such a deviation over a large range of @xmath2 would not only be a clear indication for the existence of at least one light sterile neutrino , but also begin to disambiguate among different sterile neutrino models .",

    "this interaction produces a visible muon and @xmath20 , where @xmath20 is some combination of an excited nucleus , de - excitation photons , and one or more ejected nucleons after final state interactions .",
    "the goal of the kpipe detector design is to efficiently identify these 236  mev @xmath1 cc events , broadly characterized by two separated flashes of light in time coming from the prompt @xmath21 followed by the muon s decay electron .",
    "the kpipe design calls for a relatively low cost , 3  m inner diameter ( i d ) steel - reinforced , high - density polyethylene ( hdpe ) pipe that is filled with liquid scintillator . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mlf ] , the pipe is positioned so that it extends radially outward from the target station .",
    "the upstream location maximizes the sensitivity to oscillations by being the shortest possible distance from the source , given spatial constraints .",
    "we have found that a long detector ( 120  m , 684  tons ) is most suitable for optimizing sensitivity to oscillations across a wide range of the most pertinent parameter space , in consideration of current global fit results , the neutrino energy , 1/@xmath22 , and estimated cost .",

    "simulations of the experiment described in the next section indicate that there are an adequate number of sipms to achieve the goals of the experiment .",
    "the kpipe detector succeeds despite the sparse amount of instrumentation in the inner region because of its use of liquid scintillator as the detector medium .",
    "the low photocathode coverage is overcome by the large amount of light produced by the scintillator per unit of energy deposited .",

    "this liquid scintillator consists of the lab as solvent with ppo acting as the wavelength shifter .",
    "the advantage of a lab - based liquid scintillator over those based on mineral oil is that it has a comparable light yield to the brighter saint - gobain scintillators  @xcite while also being less toxic . in order to be conservative",

    "cr particles create at least one detectable flash in either the target region or veto in only 0.87% of all windows .",

    "reduces the cr rate to 750  hz , which means that only 0.01% of all signal windows will contain a cr event . at this stage in the cuts ,",

    "after 3 years of kpipe running , the 5@xmath48 exclusion contour covers the best fit point at @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    fig .",
    "[ fig:90cl ] shows a comparison between kpipe s predicted six  year @xmath74 sensitivity and the predicted sensitivity of sbn  @xcite assuming @xmath78 pot ( 3 years ) in sbnd and the icarus - t600 and @xmath79 pot ( 6  years ) in microboone .",
    "the dashed contour represents the combined @xmath74 excluded region based on the muon neutrino disappearance results of miniboone and sciboone  @xcite .",
    "sbn and kpipe have similar sensitivity reach in the @xmath80 region , however sbn performs better at low-@xmath3 and kpipe at high-@xmath3 ; the complementarity between the experiments is clear .",
    "the j - parc mlf facility provides a unique and intense source of neutrinos in the form of monoenergetic 236  mev muon neutrinos coming from the decay - at - rest of positively charged kaons .",
    "the kpipe experiment seeks to take advantage of this source for a decisive @xmath1 disappearance search at high-@xmath3 in order to address the existing anomalies in this parameter space .",
    "the 120  m long , 3  m diameter liquid scintillator based active volume ( 684  ton ) will feature 0.4% photo - coverage for detecting these @xmath1 cc events in an attempt to discern an oscillation wave along the length of the detector .",
    "in contrast to other neutrino sources , the kpipe neutrinos are dominantly monoenergetic .",
    "this provides a great advantage in searching for neutrino oscillations .",
    "a neutrino ( or antineutrino ) induced double - coincidence muon signal detected with kpipe has a 98.5% chance of being from a 236  mev @xmath1 cc event .",
    "this simple fact allows the active detector requirements to be extremely modest , the systematic uncertainties to be practically eliminated , and the detector s energy resolution to be only a weak consideration .    within three years of running",
    ", kpipe will be able to cover the current global fit allowed region to 5@xmath48 .",
    "the sensitivity for a 6  year run at the j - parc facility will enhance existing single experiment limits on @xmath17 disappearance by an order of magnitude in @xmath3 .",
    "such a measurement , when considered alone , or in combination with existing and proposed electron flavor disappearance and appearance measurements , can severely constrain models associated with oscillations involving one or more light sterile neutrinos .",

    "<S> the kpipe measurements will be robust since they depend on a known energy neutrino source with low expected backgrounds . </S>",

    "<S> the experimental sensitivity to oscillations , based on a shape - only analysis of the @xmath2 distribution , will extend an order of magnitude beyond present experimental limits in the relevant high-@xmath3 parameter space . </S>"
