    "<S> we review properties of all known collisionally pumped ( class  i ) methanol maser series based on observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the mopra radio telescope . </S>",
    "<S> masers at 36 , 84 , 44 and 95  ghz are most widespread , while 9.9 , 25 , 23.4 and 104  ghz masers are much rarer , tracing the most energetic shocks . </S>",
    "<S> a survey of many southern masers at 36 and 44  ghz suggests that these two transitions are highly complementary . </S>",
    "<S> the 23.4 ghz maser is a new type of rare class  i methanol maser , detected only in two high - mass star - forming regions , g357.97 - 0.16 and g343.12 - 0.06 , and showing a behaviour similar to 9.9 , 25 and 104  ghz masers . </S>",
    "<S> interferometric positions suggest that shocks responsible for class  i masers could arise from a range of phenomena , not merely an outflow scenario . </S>",
    "<S> for example , some masers might be caused by interaction of an expanding hii region with its surrounding molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this has implications for evolutionary sequences incorporating class  i methanol masers if they appear more than once during the evolution of the star - forming region . </S>",
    "<S> we also make predictions for candidate maser transitions at the alma frequency range . </S>"
