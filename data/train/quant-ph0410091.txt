    "landauer  @xcite , in analysing the physical nature of ( classical ) information , showed that the amount of information stored , say , in a computer s memory , is proportional to the work required to erase the memory ( reset to zero all the bits ) .",
    "these ideas were further developed by other researchers ( most prominently bennett ) into a deep connection of classical information and thermodynamics ( see  @xcite for a recent survey ) .",
    "here we follow landauer s idea in analysing quantum information : we want to measure correlation by the ( thermodynamical ) effort required to erase ( destroy ) it .",
    "the main idea of our paper can be understood on a simple example .",
    "consider a maximally entangled state of two qubits ( equivalent to a singlet ) @xmath0    usually this state is seen as containing @xmath1 ebit , i.e. , one bit of entanglement , based on the asymptotic theory of pure state entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the temptation is to think that it contains @xmath1 bit of correlation , and that this correlation is in pure quantum form ( which can be used either quantumly  e.g. , for teleportation  or to obtain one perfectly correlated classical bit ) .",
    "we will argue however that this state contains in fact 2 bits of correlation  1 bit of entanglement and 1 bit of remaining ( secret ) classical correlations , as follows .",
    "suppose that alice wants to erase the entanglement between her bit and bob s .",
    "she can do this by applying @xmath1 bit of _ randomness _ : she applies to her qubit one of two unitary transformations @xmath2 or @xmath3 with equal probability . by this the pure state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epr ] ) becomes a mixture    @xmath4 where    @xmath5    this mixed state is disentangled because it is identical with a mixture of two direct product states    @xmath6 but although the entanglement is now gone , alice and bob s qubits are still correlated .",
    "indeed , @xmath7 contains now 1 bit of purely classical correlations ; furthermore , these correlations are secret since they are not correlated with any third party , such as an eavesdropper .    to also erase these classical correlations alice has to `` work '' more .",
    "she can do this by randomly applying a `` bit flip '' to @xmath7 , that is , applying at random , with equal probability either @xmath2 or @xmath8 .",
    "this brings the state to @xmath9 where qubit a is completely independent from qubit b.    to summarise , two bits of erasure ( or , depending on the point of view , `` bits of noise '' , or `` error '' ) , are required to completely erase the correlations in the singlet .",
    "the first bit erases the entanglement and the second erases the classical secret correlations .",
    "we then say that the singlet contains 1 bit of pure entanglement , _ and _ 1 bit of secret classical correlations .",
    "total _ amount of correlations is 2 bits .    a couple of remarks concerning the connection to landauer s theory of information erasure : just as landauer for information ( entropy ! )",
    ", our approach quantifies correlations via their _ robustness _ against destruction",
    ". however , there seems to be a contradiction : whereas landauer considers _ resetting _ the memory to a standard state ( and we take for granted that one can generalise his argument to quantum memory ) , effectively exporting  `` dissipating ''  the entropy of the system , we _",
    "inject _ entropy into it .",
    "this is actually only an apparent contradiction , as can be seen easily once we realise that in the above example we tacitly assumed that alice _ forgets _ which pauli operator she has applied .",
    "indeed , we can present what she does in more detail as follows : she has a reservoir of random bits , which she uses to apply one of the pauli operators as above in a reversible way ( by a quantum - controlled unitary ) .",
    "this step does not affect the correlations between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "only when she decides to erase ( forget ) the random bits , the correlations are affected , as we have shown above .",
    "now it is evident that the entropy pumped into the state is equal to the landauer erasure cost of the random bits .",
    "in this paper we develop these ideas , as follows .    for an arbitrary bipartite quantum state @xmath12 the quantum mutual information is defined as @xmath13 ( the name is taken from cerf and adami  @xcite , but stratonovich  @xcite has considered this quantity already in the mid-60s . )    while this definition is formally very simple , an operational interpretation for it was hitherto missing @xcite ( at least not for the quantity itself with given state ; it plays however a crucial role in the formula for the entanglement - assisted capacity of a quantum channel  @xcite ) .",
    "we show here that the total amount of correlations , as measured by the minimal rate of randomness that are required to completely erase all the correlations in @xmath12 ( in a many - copy scenario ) , is equal to the quantum mutual information .",
    "this is the main result of section  [ sec : bi - total ] . as an important consequence of this result",
    "we shall demonstrate that it leads to the _ strong subadditivity _ of von neumann entropy .    in our above example this amount of total correlations divides neatly into the amount required to obliterate the quantum correlations ( @xmath1 bit ) , and the amount to take the resulting separable state to a product state ( @xmath1 bit ) .",
    "we will follow on this in our discussion contained in section  [ sec : bi - entanglement ] , where we use this approach to define the quantum and the classical correlations in a state , and conjecture how they compare with the total correlations .",
    "section  [ sec : comparison ] contains some observations how the total , quantum and classical correlation as defined here relates to other such measures .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : multiparty ] , we extend our considerations to correlations ( quantum and classical ) of more than two players , after which we conclude .",
    "an appendix quotes the technical results about typical subspaces and our main tool , an operator version of the classical chernoff bound , which are used repeatedly , as well as miscellaneous proofs .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we want to add randomness to a state @xmath14 of a bipartite system @xmath15 ( with local hilbert space dimensions @xmath16 ) in such a way as to make it into a product state .",
    "in fact , we shall consider @xmath17 many copies of @xmath7 , and be content with achieving decorrelation ( product state ) approximately ( but arbitrarily good in the asymptotic limit ) .    in detail , the randomisation will be engineered by an ensemble of local unitaries , @xmath18 , to which is associated the randomising map",
    "@xmath19 we call the class of such completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) maps on @xmath15 `` coordinated local unitary randomising '' ( colur ) . considering that our object is to study the correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    ", it may seem a bit suspicious to allow coordinated application of @xmath20 and @xmath21 at the two sites .",
    "hence we define @xmath10-lur to be those maps where all @xmath22 , and @xmath11-lur those where all @xmath23  because they can be implemented by application of noise strictly locally at @xmath10 or @xmath11 alone , respectively . the combination of an @xmath10-lur with a @xmath11-lur map ( i.e. , independent local noise at either side ) we call simply `` local unitary randomising '' ( lur ) .",
    "we say that @xmath24 _ @xmath25-decorrelates _ a state @xmath7 if there is a product state @xmath26 such that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the trace norm of an operator , i.e.  the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues . for technical reasons , when we study the asymptotics of such transformations ( i.e. , acting on @xmath29 copies of the state @xmath7 ) , we will demand that the _ output _ of the map @xmath24 ( and similar maps studied below ) is supported on a space of dimension @xmath30 , for all @xmath29 , with some finite @xmath31 .    how to account for the amount of noise introduced : from the point of view of the ensemble of unitaries , the most conservative option will be to take @xmath32 , the space required to identify the element @xmath33 uniquely",
    ". a smaller , and in the many - copy asymptotic meaningful , quantity would be @xmath34 .",
    "note however that they are not uniquely associated with the randomising map @xmath24 .",
    "however , schumacher  @xcite , and earlier lindblad  @xcite , have proposed a measure of the entropy of a cptp map @xmath35 injects into the system @xmath36 on which it acts : for this purpose , one has to introduce an _ environment _ @xmath37 , which is initially in a pure state , and to fix a _ reference system _ @xmath38 , which purifies @xmath39 to @xmath40  note that all such purifications are related via unitaries on @xmath38 .",
    "then , the _ entropy exchange _ is defined as @xmath41 it is the entropy the _ environment _ ( initially in a pure state ) acquires in a unitary dilation of the cptp map . in this paper",
    ", @xmath36 will be a bipartite system @xmath15 .    based on elementary properties of the von neumann entropy",
    ", one can see that for every randomising map @xmath24 as above , and every state @xmath7 , @xmath42    [ prop : bi - total : lower ] consider any colur map on the bipartite system @xmath43 , @xmath44 which @xmath25-decorrelates @xmath45 .",
    "then the entropy exchange of @xmath24 relative to @xmath45 is lower bounded @xmath46 where @xmath47 in particular , the right hand side is also a lower bound on @xmath48 , and even more so on @xmath32 .",
    "first of all , because @xmath24 acts locally , @xmath49 and similarly for @xmath50 .",
    "hence we have ( using the concavity of the von neumann entropy ) @xmath51 on the other hand , we can argue that @xmath52 is very close to @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ e - decorrelation ] ) it follows that @xmath54 similarly , @xmath55 thus , by the triangle inequality , @xmath56 and we get @xmath57 hence , by the fannes inequality  @xcite , @xmath58 taking into account eq .",
    "( [ localineq ] ) we obtain @xmath59 here we use the fact that multiplying the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy - lower - fannes ] ) by @xmath29 will only weaken the inequality .",
    "now , introduce a purifying reference system @xmath38 for our state : @xmath60 , with a pure state @xmath61 on @xmath62 .",
    "then the randomising map acts on @xmath43 , producing the state @xmath63 on @xmath64 .",
    "so , by definition of the entropy exchange , @xmath65 where in the second line we have used the araki - lieb ( or triangle ) inequality  @xcite , and in the third line the fact that @xmath24 acted only on @xmath43 , i.e. initially @xmath66 ; in the last line we have inserted eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy - lower ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , we have :    [ prop : bi - total : upper ] for any state @xmath7 and @xmath67 there exists , for all sufficiently large @xmath29 , an @xmath10-lur map @xmath68 on @xmath43 , which @xmath25-decorrelates @xmath45 , and with @xmath69    for large @xmath29 , we change the state @xmath45 very little by restricting it to its typical subspace , with projector @xmath70 ( see appendix a ) , and even restricting the systems @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) to the local typical subspaces of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , with projector @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) : @xmath77 by definition of the typical subspace projectors , @xmath78 using the `` gentle measurement lemma ''  [ lemma : gentle ] .    from the properties of the typical projectors ( see again appendix a ) we obtain that @xmath79 is an operator of trace @xmath80 supported on a tensor product of ( typical sub- ) spaces of dimensions @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and such that @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",

    "putting eq .",
    "( [ 3measures ] ) and propositions  [ prop : bi - total : lower ] and  [ prop : bi - total : upper ] together , we obtain the ( robust ) asymptotic measure of total correlation in a quantum state :    [ thm : bi - total ] the total correlations in a bipartite state @xmath12 , as measured by the asymptotically minimal amount of local noise one has to add to turn it into a product ( let us denote this @xmath112 , the correlation of erasure of @xmath7 ) , is @xmath113 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath114 so , whether we allow general lur ensembles or ones restriced to @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) , whether we count conservatively the size of the ensemble , @xmath32 , or be lax and charge only the entropy exchange , and whether we define the best rate optimistically or pessimistically , it all comes down to the quantum mutual information as the optimal noise ( erasure ) rate to remove the total correlation .",
    "in passing we note that this implies the perhaps surprising result that the three ways of measuring the noise in eq .",
    "( [ 3measures ] ) , are asymptotically equivalent , as expressed in propositions  [ prop : bi - total : lower ] and  [ prop : bi - total : upper ] .",
    "in  @xcite the authors argue that the entropy exchange is a way of measuring the noise of a cptp map based on compressibility  it seems to us that the connection to that work is the following : while one can always change the basis of the environment to interpret the entropy exchage as the `` entropy of kraus operators acting '' , this change of basis will turn our initially unitary kraus operators into something else .",
    "we instead want to modify the cptp map so as to preserve the entropy exchange _ and _ unitarity of the kraus operators .",
    "we now want to present a line of thought intended to reconcile our earlier doubts whether allowing coordinated lur would be a well - behaved concept .",
    "this is based on the realisation that providing the players with the perfectly correlated data @xmath33 ( with probability @xmath115 ) is effectively giving them another state @xmath116 .",
    "this gives us the idea of regarding the situation as a kind of catalysis ; the task , for given ( general ) @xmath117 , is to decorrelate @xmath118 , but we will have to discount the overhead @xmath119 of just erasing the correlations in @xmath117 .",
    "so , we really want to consider the infimum ( over all @xmath117 ) , of the erasure cost of @xmath118 minus the cost of @xmath117 .",
    "of course , in the light of our theorem  [ thm : bi - total ] , this is @xmath120 ( which means that allowing catalysis does not change the content of our theorem ) .",
    "conceptually , however , we gain an insight : supposing we allow only lur in the randomisation , then giving the parties a perfect correlation @xmath117 allows them the following strategy : they use the perfect correlation to implement a general colur map to erase the correlations in @xmath7 and after this the one in @xmath117 .",
    "we do nt need to know how much the latter costs because we subtract the same cost anyway .",
    "thus , even though we may be restricted to lur at first , the availability of appropriate @xmath117 in a catalytic scenario effectively motivates consideration of general colur maps .",
    "it is a nice observation , though , that in theorem  [ thm : bi - total ] we can locally restrict to @xmath10-lur without the need to resort to catalysts .",
    "[ rem : lun ]    it may be worth noting that our lower bound in proposition  [ prop : bi - total : lower ] is valid for an even larger class of operations , namely `` local unital '' ( lun ) cptp maps : these are compositions of unital ( i.e. , identity preserving ) maps locally at @xmath10 and at @xmath11 . this is because all we need for the argument is that the local entropies of alice and bob can only increase under the map , which is exactly the property of unital cptp maps ; the rest of the proof is the same ( observe in particular that entropy exchange makes sense for whatever cptp map we have , not just mixtures of unitaries ! ) .",
    "cleary lur is a subset of lun , and we can even emulate colur maps by including catalysis in the sense of the previous remarks .    we can interpret this result intuitively using our explanation of our approach in terms of ( reversible ) local unitaries and landauer erasure , as given in the introduction .",
    "namely , it is well - known that unital maps @xmath35 are exactly those which admit a dilation @xmath121 hence , the local unital maps of alice and bob can be understood as reversibly interacting their registers with local noise , and subsequent erasure of that noise .",
    "the cost of the latter is bounded by the entropy exchange .",
    "[ cor : ssa ] for any tripartite state @xmath122 , @xmath123    the strong subadditivity inequality as expressed above is equivalent to @xmath124 however , by theorem  [ thm : bi - total ] above , the left hand side is the minimum local noise necessary and sufficient to asymptotically decorrelate @xmath10 from @xmath125 , and we may consider an @xmath10-lur for this , i.e. , randomisation acting only on @xmath10 . since a map which @xmath25-decorrelates @xmath126 surely also @xmath25-decorrelates @xmath12 , this minimum noise is larger or equal than the minimum noise to decorrelate the latter state , which is the right hand side , once more by theorem  [ thm : bi - total ] .",
    "observe that the proof of theorem  [ thm : bi - total ] did not invoke strong subadditivity : in the lower bound , proposition  [ prop : bi - total : lower ] , we have only used concavity ( schur convexity ) and subadditivity of the entropy ; in the upper bound , proposition  [ prop : bi - total : upper ] , only typical subspaces and random coding were employed .",
    "[ rem : total : lopc - mono ]    while it is worth noting that in our noise model we have not allowed communication between the parties , and that indeed ( and unsurprisingly ) communication can decrease as well as increase the total correlation , our result shows that the total correlation @xmath127 is indeed monotonic under local operations and _ public _ communication ( lopc ) in the following sense .",
    "every lopc is a succession of steps of the form that alice ( bob ) performs a quantum instrument  @xcite locally , transforming the state @xmath7 into an ensemble @xmath128 , of which she ( he ) communicates @xmath33 to the other party . in general ,",
    "such local quantum instrument can be characterized by adding an ancillary system @xmath129 on , say , alice s side and letting @xmath129 interact with an original subsystem @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the transformation @xmath130 is implemented locally by a cptp map . by adding",
    "a local ancilla alice can not change the quantum mutual information between her and bob , i.e. initially @xmath131 on the other hand , @xmath132 where in the first line we used monotonicity of @xmath133 under local operations , in the second line we used the formal `` quantum conditional mutual information '' , and in the third and forth we used standard properties of the von neumann entropy . combining eqs .",
    "( [ lopc1 ] ) and ( [ lopc2 ] ) we obtain @xmath134    the expression on the right is the average of the total correlations after the instrument .",
    "we can interpret this as the correlation between alice and bob conditional on an eavesdropper who monitors the classical communication between them ; in this way the common knowledge of the classical message @xmath33 does not count as correlation between alice and bob .",
    "now we use the same method of randomisation to define an entanglement measure .",

    "we can also calculate the classical correlation of @xmath140 ( up to one only conjectured entropic inequality ) :    first , by simply locally dephasing the state @xmath206 in its schmidt basis , we can obtain a separable , perfectly correlated state @xmath152 , which has as its quantum mutual information @xmath213 on the other hand , to show that this is ( asymptotically ) optimal , we need to consider local operations @xmath214 and @xmath215 ( now completely general , in the spirit of the definition of @xmath216 ) , such that @xmath217 is close to a separable state @xmath135 : @xmath218 .    by implementing the local operations as local unitaries",

    "these unitaries rotate the initial pure state @xmath233 to a pure state @xmath234 , which hence has the same entanglement as @xmath233 .",

    "let s say for example that alice acts only on her typical subspace : then she can not increase her local entropy above @xmath237 , which also is an upper bound for the mutual information of the separable state . in general",
    ", of course , we would like to be able to avoid such an assumption , and indeed the feeling is that going out of the typical subspace is suboptimal anyway .",
    "about the total correlation @xmath238 of a state we know most , primarily so because we have a usable formula .",
    "for example , because of strong subadditivity , it is monotonic under local operations , and in remark  [ rem : total : lopc - mono ] we have already argued that monotonicity extends to local operations and public communication .    again because of its coinciding with the quantum mutual information , we can easily relate the total correlation to distillability measures of quantum states , namely total distillable correlation , distillable secret key and distillable entanglement ( which are decreasing in this order ) : @xmath239 ( for the second quantity , the common randomness @xmath240 in a state , see  @xcite ; for the third and fourth , the distillable key @xmath241 and the distillable entanglement @xmath242 , see the recent results in  @xcite ) .",
    "our theorem  [ thm : bi - e : partialresult ] narrows down the entanglement erasure up to the regularisation and getting rid of @xmath25 .",
    "this is not good enough to decide any of the properties we would like an entanglement measure to have  in the first place , monotonicity under local operations and classical communication .",
    "similarly , we do nt know how to prove or disprove convexity of @xmath182 ( a situation much in contrast to the total correlations ) .    on the other hand , these properties are easily seen for the second variant of our classical correlation quantity , @xmath216 : it is monotonic under local operations ( no communication allowed , of course ) , and it is convex .    once more , we have at present little to offer in terms of comparing the erasure ( quantum and classical ) correlation measures to other quantifications of entanglement and classical correlation ; clearly , we would like @xmath182 to be an upper bound on the distillable entanglement , and some version of the classical correlation to be an upper bound on the distillable secret key .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the ( regularised ) relative entropy of entanglement should relate to the entanglement erasure  while this would be a most interesting result , we see no clear evidence either way .",
    "an interesting question arises when we return to the pure state example of the introduction , where the total correlations could be erased neatly in two steps : first by adding the minimal noise to dephase the state , and then going on from there adding noise to classically decorrelate it .",
    "we have seen that for pure states this is so generally , even for the asymptotic cost . but a priori , the definitions of quantum correlations @xmath182 and classical correlations @xmath243 require us to target quite different separable states ; figure 2 illustrates this point .",
    ", this figure illustrates the different objectives one has when considering ( i ) the total correlations , ( ii ) the quantum correlations , and ( iii ) the classical correlations . for this purpose",
    "we have ignored the subtleties of the asymptotics , and symbolise the noise required to go from one point in state space to another by their distance .",
    "then for ( i ) we seek the shortest way ( minimal noise ) from @xmath7 to the manifold of product states ( and we expect the target @xmath244 to be @xmath245 ) ; for ( ii ) we seek instead the shortest way from @xmath7 to the convex set of separable states , and going to the optimal point @xmath246 and from there on to a product state @xmath247 may in total yield a suboptimal erasure procedure . finally , for ( iii ) , we want to go from @xmath7 to a separable state @xmath248 of maximal correlation ( = distance from product states ) .",
    "even if the transition from @xmath7 to @xmath248 is done by a local randomising map , it could be that the noise cost is significantly larger than that of going from @xmath7 to @xmath246 .",
    "+ for pure state @xmath249 we have argued in subsection  [ subsec : pure ] , that all three optimal paths coincide , and that in fact @xmath250.,width=226 ]    heuristically : for an initial state @xmath7 , we could have a strategy of adding local noise to turn it into a separable state @xmath135 ( or close to ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : bi - e : partialresult ] indicates that the cost will asymptotically be the entropic gap between @xmath135 and @xmath7 : @xmath251 . in the spirit of the introductory example , we then got further and completely decorrelate @xmath135 ; according to theorem  [ thm : bi - total ] this will cost @xmath252 bits of noise .",
    "hence the total cost of this two - step process will be @xmath253 whereas if we had destroyed the correlations in one go , we would have spent noise amounting to @xmath254 which is in general smaller .",
    "we have equality if the optimal disentangling map does not increase the local entropies ( or , in the asymptotic picture , only by a sublinear amount ) . while this seems reasonable to expect",
    ", we have no argument in favour of this expectation .    finally , is it true that the quantum correlation , measured by the entanglement erasure @xmath182 , is always smaller or equal to the classical correlation ?",
    "our and perhaps the reader s intuition would answer yes , but to prove this from our definitions seems not obvious .",
    "by obvious generalisations of the approaches presented in the previous two sections one can also easily define total correlation and entanglement measures for more than two parties in the many - copy limit .",
    "we do nt want to go into too much detail here but discuss an aspect of the total correlation measure @xmath112 of a state @xmath255 of @xmath256 parties :    by easy generalisations of propositions  [ prop : bi - total : lower ] and  [ prop : bi - total : upper ] ( and remark  [ rem : lun ] ) , one obtains that @xmath257 as before , this asymptotic measure does not not depend on the details of definition , and we find a generalisation of the fact that the randomisation can be performed by one party alone in the bipartite case : the parties can decorrelate themselves locally one by one from the rest , and the individual costs add up to @xmath258 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : total ] ) . in detail : let @xmath259 decorrelate herself from @xmath260 using @xmath261 bits of randomness ( by theorem  [ thm : bi - total ] ) ; then let @xmath262 decorrelate himself from @xmath263 using @xmath264 ; etc . then adding up these quantities yields obviously the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : total ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the problem of an operational definition of the total , quantum and classical amount of correlation in a bipartite quantum state .",
    "we have shown that the above quantities can be defined via the amount of noise that is required to destroy the correlations .",
    "we have proved that the total correlation in a bipartite quantum state , measured by the asymptotically minimal amount of noise needed to erase the correlation , equals the quantum mutual information @xmath120 .",
    "thus , our approach gives the first clear operational definition of @xmath120 for any given state .",
    "this even lead to an operational proof of strong subadditivity ; it is an interesting question whether the equality conditions derived recently  @xcite can be derives in this way , too .",
    "then we extended our approach to definitions of the quantum ( entanglement ) and classical correlation content : after definitions of these quantities in the spirit of erasure , by the noise needed to destroy the entanglement , and the maximum correlation left after destroying the entanglement , we proved partial results on these quantities , and related them to other entanglement and correlation measures . in that context , we also put forward the conjecture that the amount of quantum correlations is always at most as large as the amount of classical correlations .",
    "for pure states we have verified , up to a plausible conjectured information inequality for separable states , that the proposed quantum and classical correlation measures coincide with the entropy of entanglement . in general",
    ", we had to leave open the questions of lo(cc ) monotonicity and convexity of @xmath182 and @xmath243 .",
    "( that @xmath216 is monotonic under local operations is , however , trivial from the definition ! )    the reader who is acquainted with the work of the horodecci , oppenheim and sen  @xcite will sense that there is a relation between their `` thermodynamical '' approach to correlations via extractable work ( = purity ) , and ours , even though superficially we seem to go in opposite directions : we consider the entropy increase necessary to destroy correlations  and this directly gives a correlation measure ; in the approach of  @xcite the purity content decreases as one restricts the set of allowed operations , and the `` total correlation '' appears as a _ deficit _ between global operations and local operations .",
    "if one allows also communication , the deficit is a quantum correlations measure .",
    "recently , however , these authors have been able to relate this latter deficit to the entropy production when turning the given state into a product via certain locc maps  @xcite . via landauer erasure , this now looks a lot more like our model , and inded it seems to be the case that by their including classical communication , @xcite allows for a wider class of destructive operations , and consequently , the resulting entanglement measure is no larger than our @xmath182 .",
    "this makes the lower bound from @xcite applicable , yielding that the entanglement erasure is lower bounded by the relaive entropy of entanglement ( with respect to the separable set ) .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether there is indeed a gap between them or whether the difference is washed out in the asymptotic limit involved in both definitions .",
