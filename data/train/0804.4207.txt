    "recent development in quantum information have given rise to an increasing number of applications , for instance , quantum teleportation , quantum dense coding , quantum cryptography , quantum logic gates , quantum algorithms and etc  @xcite .",
    "many tasks in quantum information processing ( qip ) have different properties from the classical counterpart , for example , the quantum cloning .",
    "classically , we can duplicate ( copy ) any bits perfectly . in the quantum case , as shown by wooters and zurek  @xcite , it is impossible to design a general machine to clone every state on the bloch s sphere perfectly .",
    "this is called the no - cloning theorem .",
    "but such the no - cloning theorem  @xcite only forbids the perfect cloning . as shown by buek and hillery ,",
    "approximate cloning of an unknown quantum state is possible .",
    "they proposed a type of universal quantum copying machine  @xcite ( uqcm ) that clones all the state on the bloch s sphere with the same optimal fidelity  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , some researches have extended the uqcm to @xmath0 inputs to @xmath1 outputs and to d - level system  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , studies have also been done on quantum cloning with prior information about unknown state  @xcite , the example is the cloning of phase covariant state  @xcite or unknown equatorial state  @xcite given by @xmath2 it has already been proven that the above state can be cloned with the optimal fidelity @xmath3 $ ]  @xcite and the fidelity is higher than uqcm s .",
    "this is to say , if we already have some prior information about the unknown state , we can design a better copying machine for the state .",
    "the result  @xcite was subsequently extended to more general case  @xcite and experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the uqcm and the phase covariant cloning do not subsume each other , because one can not be regarded as a special case of the other . in real applications of the quantum information system",
    ", we sometimes have access only to pure states distributed on a specific surface on a bloch sphere . in this article",
    ", we study out such general situation in which the states are distributed between two latitudes on a bloch sphere .",
    "our result unifies the prior results pertaining to uqcm and phase covariant cloning : in particular , one could bring the two latitudes to the poles for uqcm or set the two latitudes together for phase covariant cloning .    to this end , we consider the following state : @xmath4 where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath6 .",
    "the states we considered here are uniformly distributed between two latitudes on the bloch sphere .",
    "when @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we get the situation of the uqcm . when @xmath9 , it is the phase covariant cloning . in this way , results of the uqcm and the phase covariant cloning can be unified : they are recovered as special cases of our qcm .",
    "contrary to general perception that we can get a better qcm , we point out that this view may not always be true .    this paper is arranged as follows : after introducing some results concerning uqcm  @xcite and phase covariant cloning  @xcite , we formulate our problem in section and present analytical results to the situation . in section ,",
    "we make detailed discussions about our 1 @xmath10 2 qcm and also a qualitative discussion about the situation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we end the paper with some concluding remarks .    for an arbitrary quantum state on the bloch s sphere",
    ", we can use the following unitary transformation to get the optimal result for the cloning : @xmath13    for the state @xmath14 , after operated by the cloning operation u , we can get the density matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 by taking partial trace .",
    "we then define the cloning fidelity @xmath17 . for the case of 1 to 2 uqcm",
    ", it can be proved that @xmath18  @xcite .    for the phase covariant cloning there",
    "already exists a method of adjusting a parameter in the uqcm to get a better cloning fidelity  @xcite .",
    "the state we wish to clone can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath20 this is to say , the states we considered here are uniformly distributed in a belt between two latitudes on the bloch sphere . we assume the following unitary transformation for our qcm : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is defined as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 being parameters that we want to determined .",
    "we restrain ourselves only to a symmetric transformation and we prove its optimality below .",
    "after transformation by the unitary operation u , we can get the following state : @xmath26 by taking partial trace , we can calculate the reduced density matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 of particle a and b respectively .",
    "@xmath27 with the density matrices of the subsystem , we can get the fidelity @xmath28 averaging the fidelity over all possible angles @xmath29 , we have  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants with given @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in order to get the maximum of @xmath35 , we do a partial differentiating @xmath35 with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for maximum @xmath35 , the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the optimal qcm should satisfy the following equations : @xmath36      with the formulation above",
    ", we can now seek the solution of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with maximum @xmath35 .",
    "consider the situation in which the state cover the whole bloch sphere .",
    "for this situation , @xmath7 and @xmath37 , and we have @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we can also solve the equations   to get @xmath41 .",
    "this is the well known result in uqcm .",
    "now the general situation , we can easily get @xmath42=0.\\ ] ]    if it satisfies that @xmath43 we have @xmath44 then we can get the following solution @xmath45 +    \\arcsin\\left[\\frac{p(q - r)}{2qr}\\right ] , \\quad    2\\beta=\\arcsin\\left[\\frac{p(q+r)}{s}\\right]-    \\arcsin\\left[\\frac{p(q - r)}{2qr}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 , we can get @xmath48 and @xmath49 . since @xmath50 , there are only two cases    1 .",
    "if @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    in summary ,",
    "the mean fidelity of our qcm is : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given in eq .  .",
    "our qcm discussed above has a symmetric form defined by eq .  .",
    "in this section , we will prove that the symmetric form is necessary .",
    "we consider all possible forms of quantum cloning . if the transformation u of the bases is not in such a symmetric form , we know that the reduced density matrices of the particle a and b are not equal to each other .",
    "we then get the different fidelities for particle a and b @xmath60 for the purpose of the cloning , we can only define the fidelity as follows @xmath61 then we can construct another quantum cloning machine q to satisfy : @xmath62 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the reduced density matrices of two particles a and b.    if we use u and q with probability @xmath63 to copy the state , the reduced density matrices of two particles will be the same @xmath64 . in this situation , the cloning fidelity @xmath65 .",
    "we have @xmath66 .",
    "finally we get a symmetric form .",
    "it can also be said that for every possible cloning , we can always find a symmetric cloning transformation that is optimal .",
    "so we need only consider the form given by eq .  .",
    "after getting the solution to this symmetric situation , we find the optimal qcm .",
    "given @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we can calculate the optimal fidelity by using eq .  .",
    "fig.1 presents all the situation with states uniformly distributed in any belt on the bloch space . with observation from fig.1 and simple derivation ,",
    "we arrive at the following results :    1 .   if @xmath69 , it is the situation of the uqcm and the optimal fidelity is @xmath18 which corresponds to points b@xmath70 or b@xmath71 in fig.1 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath9 , we encounter the situation of phase - covariant qcm and the optimal fidelity is @xmath72 which corresponds to the point c in fig.1 ; 3 .",
    "fixed one latitude of the belt , we can set @xmath33 to be constant without closing any generality , the minimum fidelity will be get at the point with @xmath73 .",
    "for example , fixed @xmath74 , fig.2 draw the optimal fidelity with @xmath75 $ ] . the minimum optimal fidelity obtained when @xmath76 .",
    "contrary to one s intuition , the fidelity of cloning can rise with the area of where t he unknown input state is on .     and",
    "b@xmath71 correspond to the situation of uqcm .",
    "point c corresponds to the situation of phase - covariant qcm .",
    "the bottom line corresponds to the situation of @xmath77.,width=434 ]    [ fig : figtotal ]    $ ] .",
    "point d corresponds to the minimum optimal fidelity with @xmath78.,width=377 ]    [ fig : figmin ]    in general , we sometimes will encounter the problem of multiple cloning , i.e. @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    "we discuss the results for @xmath79 cloning to case of @xmath80 and @xmath81 qualitatively .",
    "for the states @xmath82 , where @xmath5 $ ] and @xmath83 .",
    "we can assume  @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the auxiliary quantum system .",
    "we know that the parameters of particle a and b are not completely independent .",
    "we must let the reduced density matrices of @xmath0 particles to be the same form in order to achieve optimality , so we can assume that the cloning transformation of bases take a symmetric form .",
    "using the same method and defining the fidelity as @xmath17 , we get @xmath87 and we calculate the partial derivative es of the free parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 and set them to zero , getting the following equations : @xmath90 these equations are high - order multi - variant equations and in general the higher - order equations has no analytical solution .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for the @xmath81 situation .",
    "in summary , we have presented the quantum cloning machine for qubits uniformly distributed on a belt between two latitudes of the bloch sphere .",
    "previous results regards @xmath91 cloning of both the universal cloning and the phase covariant cloning can unified into a single formulism . so that the previous results are recovered as special case of the current results .",
