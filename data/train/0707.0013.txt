    "the study of radiative properties of high - energy - density plasmas has many applications in inertial confinement fusion and astrophysics .",
    "it requires knowledge of the plasma properties in extreme conditions of density and temperature .",
    "for example , the pressure in the center of jupiter is believed to reach 100 mbar and temperature 25 kk , while in the center of white dwarfs pressure can exceed gbars at temperatures of 10@xmath0 k. in the laboratory , laser - based shock - wave experiments attain pressures of hundreds of megabars , obtained via the absorption of an intense laser pulse .",
    "the thermodynamics and the hydrodynamics of hot dense plasmas can not be predicted without a knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) that describes how a material reacts to pressure .",
    "for instance , the theory of stellar evolution is affected by uncertainties in eos . after being predicted , brown dwarfs have recently been observed .",
    "their internal structure and cooling time depend on the details of the eos at densities approaching solid density and at temperatures of a few ev , conditions obtainable in laser experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , the need for suitable eos of high - energy - density matter becomes crucial .",
    "a material subjected to a strong shock wave is compressed , heated and ionized . as the strength of the shock",
    "is varied for a fixed initial state , the ensemble of the pressure - density final states of the material behind the shock , named shock adiabat or rankine - hugoniot ( rh ) curve , depends on the eos of the matter , which must be determined from theory . at intermediate shock pressures , when the material becomes partially ionized , the eos depends on the precise quantum - mechanical state of the matter , _",
    "i.e. _ on the electronic shell structure .",
    "therefore , for the past twenty years there is a great interest in the physics of bound levels in high - energy - density plasmas and quantum self - consistent - field ( qscf ) models @xcite are replacing the older thomas - fermi ( tf ) approach @xcite .",
    "we present rh curves calculated using our qscf - based eos code , esode ( equation of state with orbital description of electrons ) .",
    "the ionic contribution to the eos is described by an ideal gas with ocp ( one component plasma ) corrections , and the cold curve ( t=0 k isotherm ) has been obtained in most of the cases from augmented plane wave ( apw ) calculations @xcite .",
    "esode has two treatments for the thermal electronic contribution to the eos : average atom in a spherical cell ( asc ) or average atom in a jellium of charges ( ajc ) . in both cases , bound electrons",
    "are treated quantum - mechanically . in the asc model ,",
    "all electrons are confined within a wigner - seitz sphere and free electrons are described in the tf approximation . in the ajc model , bound and",
    "free - electron wavefunctions can extend outside the sphere , where the plasma is represented by a uniform electronic density ( jellium ) neutralized by a continuous background of positive charges , representing ions . the qscf models ( asc and ajc ) are described in sec .",
    "shock adiabats calculated from those models are presented , analyzed and compared to traditional tf model and to published experimental data in sec .",
    "general features of rh curves , like the interpretation of shell effects in terms of specific heat , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] as well .",
    "an analytical estimate for the maximum compression rate is proposed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . finally , the dependence of shock velocity on particle velocity is analyzed in sec .",
    "in the present work , we consider the regime identified as strongly coupled ( non - ideal ) plasmas , characterized by a high density and/or a low temperature . in such plasmas , ions are strongly correlated , electrons are partially degenerate , and the coupling parameter @xmath1 , ratio of coulomb potential energy and thermal energy , is greater than unity .",
    "the main task is to evaluate the thermal and compressional excitations of the electrons .",
    "the determination of the average electronic charge density relies usually on the density functional theory ( dft ) , of which a well - known example is the thomas - fermi ( tf ) model @xcite .",
    "it contains essential features to characterize the material properties in extreme conditions and is expected to be most reliable at extreme conditions when the detailed influence of the electronic structure does not play any role . despite the omission of quantum structure , tf model typically predicts electronic densities in broad agreement with detailed approaches .",
    "however , as the pressure or temperature is raised , successive shells of electrons are delocalized and the effect of such phenomena is represented only in an averaged manner by the tf model .",
    "atoms in a plasma can be represented by an average atom confined in a wigner - seitz ( ws ) sphere , whose radius @xmath2 is related to matter density . inside the sphere , the electron density has the following form :    @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath4}\\;\\ ; \\text{and } \\;\\ ; f_{n/2}(a , x,\\sigma)=\\int_a^{\\infty}\\frac{y^{n/2}(1+\\sigma y/2)^{1/2}}{1+\\exp[y - x]}dy\\ ] ]    are , respectively , the fermi - dirac population and the modified fermi function of order @xmath5 . the first term in eq .",

    "equations ( [ rel1 ] ) to ( [ rel2 ] ) enable one to include relativistic effects without solving dirac equation .      in order to go beyond the tf approximate treatment of continuum electron charge density ,",
    "it is necessary to use a full quantum - mechanical description of the continuum states and to consider that both bound and free orbitals can extend outside the ws sphere , which requires the definition of the environment beyond the central average ion .",
    "one way to address this is the jellium model ( or electron - gas model ) , _ i.e. _ a uniform electron density ( @xmath36 ) neutralized by a positive background @xmath37 simulating the ionic charges .",
    "the model relies on a method proposed by friedel @xcite to treat the electronic structure of an impurity , represented by a spherical potential of finite range , in an electron gas .",

    "the problem is reduced to the response of the electronic density to the immersion of a positive charge @xmath38 into the jellium .",

    "the pressure in eq .",
    "( [ pv ] ) is rigorously the derivative of energy with respect to volume .",
    "this is the main difference with liberman s model @xcite .",
    "the major difficulty with these models is that the average ionization is not well defined when the outer electrons are delocalized . the only way to make",
    "the formalism variational is to specify the ionization in the ajc model . in other words ,",
    "the question is how to define the residual electron density ( @xmath36 ) far away from the point where the positive charge is introduced into the jellium .",
    "a convenient choice is @xcite @xmath53 , @xmath54 being the tf ionization",
    ". then derivatives of ionization with respect to volume and temperature can be obtained analytically , using the numerical fit proposed by more @xcite . at first sight , asc and ajc models",
    "seem to be very different concerning the modeling of the environment of the atom , isolated and confined in the asc model , and immersed in an infinite effective medium in the ajc model .",
    "however , when the electronic structure is calculated in the tf approximation , these models are equivalent if the jellium density @xmath55 is equal to tf density evaluated at the ws radius .",
    "such a property comes from a variational principle ( minimization of the free energy ) .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is used to separate the thermodynamic functions into electronic and ionic components .",
    "the total pressure can be written :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 , is the thermal electronic contribution to the eos .",
    "the quantity @xmath58 is the ionic pressure and subscript `` c '' characterizes the cold curve obtained from apw @xcite simulations or using the vinet @xcite universal eos .",
    "equation ( [ eos1 ] ) also holds for internal energy . in order to take into account non - ideality corrections to the thermal motion of ions we use an approximation @xcite based on the calculation of the eos of a one - component plasma ( ocp ) by the monte carlo method @xcite .",

    "@xmath73 is the shock velocity , @xmath74 the matter velocity , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are respectively the pressure and internal energy behind the shock front .",
    "these variables obey the following rankine - hugoniot relation @xcite :    @xmath77    the rh curve can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ hug ] ) at each temperature step .",
    "calculations have been performed for @xmath78 6.4 kev for beryllium ( be , z=4 ) , aluminum ( al , z=13 ) , iron ( fe , z=26 ) and copper ( cu , z=29 ) calculated from pure thomas - fermi eos , asc model , and ajc model .",
    "the cold curve has been calculated using vinet universal eos @xcite for be and apw @xcite method for al , fe and cu .",
    "results from the qscf models differ strongly from the tf approximation and slightly from eachother . in the case of al , which we use as an example ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the difference between the theories appears for @xmath79 3 mbar and ajc gives higher pressures than the other models for 2@xmath80 3.5 , where @xmath81 is the compression rate . for @xmath82 3.5 , all qscf models give lower pressures than tf model .",
    "our models emphasize the thermodynamic domain where rh curves strongly depend on the electronic structure , _",
    "i.e. _ beyond four times solid density where the shoulders ( double in the case of al , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) correspond to ionization of successive shells .",
    "these shoulders can be explained by the competition between the release of internal energy stored in the shells and the free - electron pressure .",
    "when ionization begins , the energy of the shock depopulates the relevant shells and the material is very compressive",
    ". however , the pressure due to the free electrons eventually dominates and the material becomes less compressive .",
    "both models show compression maxima in the range @xmath83 . in this region ,",
    "the electrons from the ionic cores are being ionized .",
    "the shock density increases beyond the infinite pressure of @xmath84 in the electron ionization region . as ionization",
    "is completed , the plasma approaches an ideal gas of nuclei and electrons and the density approaches the fourfold density @xmath84 . for",
    "be , all the models yield a single density maximum , corresponding to the ionization of the k electron shell . for al ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , there are two density maxima corresponding to the k and l electron shells , each followed by density decreases .",
    "for fe and cu there are density maxima or inflexions corresponding to the k , l and m electron shells .",
    "the l - shell ionization feature gives the largest density increase . in the case of cu ,",
    "the asc model exhibits a kind of discontinuity around 40 g/@xmath85 , due to pressure ionization of @xmath86 orbital .",
    "such a sharp increase of pressure does not exist in the ajc model , because this model is consistent from the thermodynamic point of view .",
    "this is due to the fact that the pressure is rigorously obtained as a derivative of the free energy , and shape resonances are carefully taken into account in the quantum treatment of free electrons .",
    "such features lead to a continuous disappearing of a bound state into the continuum , which is a suitable treatment of pressure ionization .",
    "in fact , the non - monotonic character of thermodynamic variables stems from the eigen - energies of the orbitals themselves , which exhibit the oscillations as well . the first density for which decompression occurs is named `` turnaround '' point .",
    "the pressure differences from the quantum mechanical theory can be explained by examining the electronic heat capacity per particle predicted by the two theories along the rh path . at low temperature ,",
    "the electronic heat capacity depends on the number of electrons that can be excited around the fermi energy and the tf theory predicts a smooth increase since the density of states in this model is a monotonic function of energy .",
    "therefore , the electronic specific heat per particle    @xmath87}{\\partial t}\\ ] ]    displays the signature of the ionization of successive shells .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] represents @xmath88 along the rh curve in the tf and in the asc models for al .",
    "both theories show the effect of the coulomb attractive potential of the nucleus binding the electrons , represented by the peak around 300 ev for tf theory and 100 ev for asc model .",
    "after the first reduction in density on the rh curve , there are 11 free electrons and 2 bound electrons remaining in the @xmath89 orbital ( k shell ) , which is far away from the energy zero ( 1.5 kev at 100 ev ) .",
    "as long as temperature is not sufficient to ionize those two electrons , the specific heat tends to an asymptote corresponding to an ideal gas of 11 independent particles . when both @xmath89 electrons are ionized ( after a `` threshold '' temperature ) , there is a sudden break in the specific heat , which tends to an ideal gas of 13 independent particles . this phenomenon is a kind of `` schottky anomaly '' , _",
    "i.e. _ an enhancement in the specific heat ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this effect is not as important for the @xmath90 and @xmath86 bound states ( l shell ) , since their energy levels are not as far from the continuum ( a few tenth of ev ) .",
    "we note that the same phenomenon occurs for fe ; in that case , after two `` schottky anomalies '' , the electronic part of the specific heat tends to an ideal gas of 26 electrons .",
    "experimental data concerning be , al , fe and cu @xcite have been collected for comparison with the eos models presented .",
    "several experimental methods have been used to generate well - defined shock states : gas guns for pressures up to 5 mbar , explosive - driven spherical implosions , laser - driven plane waves for generating shocks up to 10 mbar , and through underground nuclear explosions where pressures of a few gbar can be attained .",
    "superimposing these data should yield a single smooth rh curve .",
    "the maximum pressures reached in the experiments are : 18 mbar for be , 4000 mbar for al , 191 mbar for fe and 204 mbar for cu .",
    "it is clear that there is difficulty discriminating between models , since there are very few available data for the region of interest , _",
    "i.e. _ , above 100 mbar ) .",
    "the error bars associated with the highest pressures for al are too large to provide insight into the existence of shell effects .",
    "analysis of the computational results shows that the deviation from the experimental points of al can not be explained only by shell effects . in the region where most of the experimental points are available ,",
    "the role of the cold component is important , while shell effects begin to play a significant role after the matter is compressed , which occurs near the limiting compression @xmath91 , and heating begins . for fe and cu , results from ajc model",
    "are found to be in better agreement with experimental points than the hybrid model asc .",
    "finally , we note that it is very difficult to relate gas gun measurements with a discussion of shell effects as the pressures are too low to exhibit these effect .",
    "the maximum compression rate depends on the choice of the boundary conditions of the wavefunctions described in sec .",
    "[ subsec0 ] .",
    "furthermore , it depends on the calculation of the ionic part : ideal gas ( ig ) with or without ocp corrections ( eqs .",
    "( [ ig2]-[ig3 ] ) ) .",
    "for instance , the maximum rate for al in the asc model with ig is @xmath92 and with ig and ocp corrections @xmath93 .",
    "ocp corrections systematically increase the maximum compression rate . as can be checked in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the maximum compression attainable by a single shock is larger than 4 and occurs at finite pressure .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the draining of internal energy in internal degrees of freedom , _ via _ ionization .",
    "an analytical expression for the maximum compression attainable by a single shock in any material from any initial state , except those with gaseous densities , can be formulated .",
    "the total energy can be written as the sum of kinetic and potential energies @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "neglecting exchange - correlation contribution , the virial theorem enables one to relate pressure , kinetic energy and potential energy @xmath96 .",
    "the compression rate @xmath81 for the standard rh curve , @xmath97 , @xmath70 solid density and @xmath71=300 k , can be written    @xmath98    at high compression , assuming that @xmath99 and that all the electrons have been ionized and have a kinetic energy equal to the fermi energy , one can write :    @xmath100    where @xmath101=52.9177208319 10@xmath102 cm is the bohr radius , @xmath103 is in g/@xmath85 , and @xmath104 in g. next , at high compression the excess potential energy can be estimated as the coulomb interaction energy of two ionic spheres    @xmath105^{1/3}\\rho^{-1/3},\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the ws radius equal to the cavity radius @xmath42 and we set @xmath106 . therefore , using eqs .",

    "shock waves generating finite - temperature dense matter make possible the generation in laboratory experiments of extremely high energy densities typical of matter in the few first microseconds after the creation of the universe and for such astrophysical objects as stars and giant planets .",
    "the physical information obtained from these experiments extends the basic knowledge of physical properties of these systems to pressures nine orders of magnitude higher than found , _",
    "e.g. _ , in our atmosphere .",

    "the ajc model provides a better treatment of pressure ionization , since it relies on a full quantum treatment of the electrons .",
    "an estimate of the maximum compression , giving realistic values , has been proposed .",
    "the next step will be to test whether the oscillations still exist `` beyond '' the average atom model , _",
