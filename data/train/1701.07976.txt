    "shaping refers to methods that adapt the signal distribution to a communication channel for increased transmission efficiency .",
    "shaping is eventually important for optimal information transmissions @xcite and various solutions starting with non - linear mapping over asymmetric channel models towards pragmatic proposals involving shaped qam signaling have been investigated and/or implemented over the years .",
    "more precisely , building upon early works on , e.g. , many - to - one mapping , research efforts from the 70s towards the 90s derive conceptual frameworks and methods to reduce the shaping gap in communication systems . exploiting the principles of coded modulation , a sequence of works @xcite present operational methods to reduce the shaping gap .",
    "compared to cubic constellations , up to @xmath0db of _ shaping gain _ is achievable using well - adapted signaling .",
    "simple methods such as trellis shaping or shell mapping permit to recover a significant fraction of the 1.53db figure .",
    "examples of applications include the itu v.34 modem standard recommendations that uses shell mapping to recover 0.8db .",
    "while several shaping schemes are based on the structural properties of lattices @xcite , more randomized schemes also emerge after the re - discovery of probabilistic decoding in the 90s . with the advent of efficient binary codes ,",
    "different coded modulation schemes were proposed offering flexible and low - complex solutions @xcite . in the 2000s , despite the important development of wireless communications , the need for advanced shaping methods seems to have remained marginal . from a technological viewpoint , this may have been justified by the high variations of the channel in wireless communication networks . from an academic viewpoint , schemes have been analyzed and match the capacity - achieving distribution of a channel in different theoretical scenarios @xcite . in the last few years , industrial applications of shaping methods have regained interest .",
    "this concerns areas where current technologies operate close to fundamental limits .",
    "for example , different methods have been experimented in optical communications @xcite .",
    "hence , because there are already efficient vlsi implementations of contemporary coding schemes that have been proven to asymptotically achieve capacity with constant complexity per information unit @xcite , it is then natural to combine them with efficient shaping methods . in probabilistic shaping , for linear digital modulations , the _ a priori _ probability distribution of modulation points is modified to match a discrete gaussian - like distribution , namely the maxwell - boltzmann distribution @xcite .",
    "the method aims at maximizing the mutual information with respect to the same modulation where all points are equally likely . for special @xmath1-ask and @xmath1-qam constellations with linear binary codes ,",
    "this method is equivalent to probabilistic amplitude shaping ( pas ) where uniformly - distributed parity bits are assigned to the sign of a constellation point @xcite . in this paper , we generalize this method to the non - binary case .",
    "the goal is to permit the use of efficient non - binary codes in order to enable low - latency processing ( reducing the need for ` turbo'-detection @xcite ) . also , from an algebraic viewpoint , a characteristic @xmath2 of the finite field @xmath3 on which coding is built leads to new interesting problems such as distribution matching in @xmath3 and assigning a constellation points to elements in @xmath3 .    in this paper ,",
    "codes are supposed to be linear and defined over @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an odd prime .",
    "firstly , except for codes with a sparse generator matrix , we show in section  [ sec_gallager_fp ] that parity symbols are asymptotically uniformly - distributed over @xmath4 .",
    "this fact is used to derive two new methods for probabilistic shaping .",
    "time sharing is proposed in section  [ sec_time_sharing ] where symbols of a @xmath5-ary code are mapped into @xmath5-ask points .",
    "hence , in time sharing , probabilistic shaping is performed only when information symbols are transmitted .",
    "full probabilistic shaping is described in section  [ sec_circular_qam ] where circular qam ( cqam ) constellations of size @xmath6 points are introduced .",
    "this second method assigns a constellation shell to a maxwell - boltzmann - distributed information symbol and then a parity symbol selects a point within that shell .",
    "numerical results for @xmath5-ask - based time sharing and @xmath6-cqam probabilistic shaping are shown in section  [ sec_results ] .",
    "similar to the binary case  @xcite , a gap to channel capacity of @xmath7 db or less is observed for cqam constellations .",
    "lemma  4.1 in  @xcite established the expressions of the probability of a sum in @xmath8 .",
    "we translate this result to a prime field @xmath9 . principles of this extension to the non - binary case are implicit from chapter  5 of  @xcite with the use of the @xmath10-transform .",
    "nevertheless , we give here the exact expression of the probability of a sum of prime random symbols modulo  @xmath5 .",
    "this expression is directly related to hartmann - rudolph symbol - by - symbol probabilistic decoding @xcite in the special case of a single - parity check code and its generalization to characteristic @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "consider the enumerator function in @xmath22 , @xmath23 observe that if this is expanded into a polynomial in @xmath22 ( where degree operations are taken mod @xmath5 ) , the coefficient of @xmath24 is the probability that the sum of @xmath13 symbols is @xmath19 , which we write @xmath25.\\ ] ]    let us also define for any @xmath26 the function @xmath27    in an identical manner as for @xmath28 , expanding @xmath29 would enumerate the probabilities of the sum of the @xmath18 s . recall that the @xmath5-th root of unity in the complex plane satisfies @xmath30 for any @xmath31 .",
    "then , for any @xmath17 , we have @xmath32 because all but the constant polynomial terms are annihilated from the fact that the roots of unity sum to zero .",
    "it remains to evaluate the expression observing that @xmath33 to get the results .",
    "@xmath34    this lemma shows that , if a @xmath18 is uniformly distributed over @xmath4 , then the sum is also uniformly distributed .    for any @xmath14",
    ", it is straightforward from convexity arguments that the weighted sum @xmath35 in the complex plane lies inside the unit circle in the strict sense if and only if one of the probability distribution @xmath36 is not degenerated in one singular point . therefore , assuming that the norm tends to be smaller and bounded away from 1 , the distribution of the infinite sum tends to be uniform .",
    "it remains to summarize this observation in a theorem .",
    "[ th_uniform_parity ] let @xmath5 be a prime and @xmath37 be the associated galois field .",
    "consider a sequence @xmath38 of independent random symbols over @xmath4 with respective probability distributions @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41    for error - correction over a prime field , this observation is interesting as follows .",
    "the limit theorem over @xmath4 indicates that the non - systematic symbols obtained from a linear encoder associated with a dense generator matrix will tend to have a uniform distribution independently on the input distribution .",
    "a common mapping between non - binary codes and non - binary modulations is to select a constellation and a finite field of identical size .",
    "let @xmath5 be a prime integer , @xmath2 .",
    "consider the set of @xmath5 points shown in figure  [ fig_p - ask ] , known as @xmath5-ask modulation .",

    "is directly fed as a soft value to the input of a probabilistic decoder .",
    "secondly , turbo detection - decoding between the constellation @xmath45 and the code @xmath47 is not required as for binary codes with non - binary modulations @xcite . + consider a systematic linear code @xmath47 over @xmath4 where parity symbols satisfy theorem  [ th_uniform_parity ] , i.e.",

    "sharing scheme , probabilistic shaping is made only during a fraction @xmath59 of transmission time .",
    "this method is attractive due to isomorphism between the field @xmath4 and the @xmath5-ask constellation . from ( [ equ_rt_time_sharing ] )",
    ", one may quickly conclude that high coding rate is recommended to approach full - time probabilistic shaping .",
    "however , at @xmath59 close to @xmath77 , the mutual information @xmath78 , for @xmath79 , approaches its asymptote @xmath80 and the required signal - to - noise ratio @xmath70 goes far away from @xmath71 .",
    "this is clearly shown in the numerical results presented in section  [ sec_results ] .",
    "a method for full probabilistic shaping is proposed in the next section .",
    "we propose in this section a coded modulation scheme that allows full probabilistic shaping of all transmitted symbols with a non - binary linear code over @xmath4 .",
    "probabilistic amplitude shaping with binary codes maps uniformly - distributed parity bits into the sign of an ask point @xcite .",
    "this sign mapping is not valid with a prime finite field @xmath4 , @xmath2 .",
    "the key idea in our new coded modulation is to assign the parity symbol to @xmath5 modulation points with the same amplitude .",
    "this is a direct generalization of the sign mapping to @xmath5-ary mapping .",
    "the linear @xmath5-ary code is assumed to be systematic .",
    "its information symbols become amplitude labels in the modulation .",

    "such a bi - dimensional constellation is not unique . indeed",

    "this may be useful when comparing two constellations of different sizes .",
