    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the leading candidates of physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) solving the hierarchy problem .",
    "unfortunately , we have no indication of susy at present . furthermore , an observed higgs boson mass of 126 gev discovered at lhc puts severe constraints on the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) parameter space , namely the mssm with light sparticles .",
    "in this situation , we have two approaches to proceed .",
    "one is the mssm with heavy sparticles , the so - called high scale susy breaking scenario which gives up to solve the naturalness problem .",
    "the other is extensions of the mssm .",
    "we take the latter approach and focus on the dirac gaugino scenario @xcite as one of the many interesting extensions . the setup to realize dirac gaugino scenario is as follows .",

    "these masses are flavor - blind since it is induced by the sm gauge interactions .",
    "therefore , we have no susy flavor and cp problems .    in dirac gaugino scenario , gaugino masses are typically heavier than the sfermion masses by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "this fact relaxes the bounds from lhc experiment for spectrum since the gluino and squark production are suppressed comparing to the majorana gaugino case .",
    "in this section , we discuss a new mechanism of d - term dynamical susy breaking generating mixed majorana - dirac gaugino masses , which we proposed several years ago @xcite .",
