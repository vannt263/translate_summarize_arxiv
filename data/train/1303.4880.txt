    "* johnston et al . ( 1999 ) ) proposed that the accretion and accretion disk of this ns x - ray binary ( nsxb ) could evolve with orbital phase .",
    "with software heasoft 6.11 and ftools v.6.11 , we choose the observations during two orbital periods ( 1996 september 21october 7 , 1996 march 819 ) of cir x-1 to perform our analysis . following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* stewart et al . ( 1991 ) ) , the time of zero phase is given by the ephemeris equation @xmath3 we produce the background - subtracted pca spectra at different phases .",
    "* shirey et al . ( 1999 ) ) used several spectral models to fit the pca spectra of cir x-1 and found that the best - fit model is the so - called eastern model , consisting of a blackbody ( bb ) and a multicolor disk blackbody ( mcd ) , which are interpreted as the emission from the ns surface and the optically thick accretion disk , respectively .",
    "we adopt this model , use it to fit the spectra of cir x-1 during the two orbital periods , and then get the inner disk temperature @xmath4 , inner disk radius ( @xmath0 ) , bb temperature @xmath5 , and bb radius @xmath6 .",
    "the bb radii multiplied by a coefficient are considered as the typical ns radius .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , the disk emission deviates from the relation of @xmath7 , which indicates that @xmath0 is varied , because of @xmath8 . in panel",
    "a of figure  [ fig1 ] , one can see that at the periastron ( phase 0 - 0.1 ) @xmath0 increases abruptly , then from phase 0.1 to the apastron ( phase 0.5 ) @xmath0 decreases rapidly , and , finally , from the apastron to phase 1 the @xmath0 roughly steadies . as suggested by (",
    "* johnston et al . ( 1999 ) ) , at the periastron the large tidal force could make the disk unstable , resulting in large variation of @xmath0 ; after the apastron until the apastron the disk is formed gradually and meanwhile the ns departs from the companion star , but the disk moves towards the ns due to decrease of radiation pressure ; after the apastron , steady accretion takes place on the formed disk .",
    "it is obvious that during the passage for the ns to leave the companion star the slow increase of @xmath4 and , however , the rapid decrease of @xmath0 contribute to the inverse correlation between the disk luminosity and the inner disk temperature .",
