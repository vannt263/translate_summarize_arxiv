    "a complete understanding of the origin of cosmic rays ( crs ) will be achieved when the acceleration processes , the sources and the propagation from the sources to the earth will be included in a self - consistent theoretical framework .",
    "this goal is far from being achieved : for ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) the issue of the propagation is probably easier to understand since the effect of extragalactic magnetic field is expected to be not crucial , at least above energies of @xmath1 @xcite . on the other hand in this case",
    "the sources are fully unknown . for crs below @xmath2",
    "we are confident that the sources are located within our galaxy and most likely are supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite . in this respect",
    "a large bulk of information is being collected from x - ray and @xmath3-ray astronomy : high resolution x - ray observations have shown the presence of intense magnetic fields in the vicinity of the shocks that bound the shell of the remnant @xcite , thereby making the acceleration process easier to understand .",
    "the combination with the observed x - ray spectra and the outstanding detection of @xmath4 tev gamma rays from a few snrs @xcite make a rather strong case in favor of these astrophysical sources being the accelerators of protons up to the knee or slightly above it @xcite .",
    "nuclei would then be accelerated to even higher maximum energies , up to @xmath5 ev for iron nuclei .",
    "although the observational situation and the theoretical understanding are both experiencing a substantial improvement as far as the sources ( or at least snrs ) are concerned , a realistic description of the propagation of crs in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is still missing , despite the very impressive amount of work carried out on the topic ( see @xcite and references therein for a recent review ) .",
    "such work may be classified in two broad classes : analytical approaches and simulations .",
    "most analytical work is based on the solution of the diffusion - convection equation from a distribution of sources in a medium with given diffusion properties .",
    "we include in this class the work that is based on a numerical solution of the transport equation ( e.g. galprop @xcite or the model presented in @xcite ) . in the most general case ,",
    "the equation has been solved with both parallel and perpendicular diffusion taken into account .",
    "these approaches start from the premise that the magnetic field of the galaxy induces only a diffusive behaviour on crs , namely the turbulent field is the key ingredient .",
    "this component is provided _ a priori _ , either in the form of pre - calculated diffusion coefficients or in the form of turbulent spectra .",
    "it is worth stressing that the spectrum of the turbulence responsible for particle diffusion , the total power in turbulent modes and the origin of such turbulence are unknown .",
    "however , if one assumes that the spectrum is known , then the diffusion coefficients could be calculated , at least in principle , using quasi - linear theory and neglecting the geometry of the large scale background magnetic field .",
    "the most common approach in the literature consists of using low energy data on the ratio of secondary to primary nuclei in crs as a function of energy to infer the energy dependence of the propagation time , which in turn leads to a rough knowledge of the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "such dependence is then adopted in the solution of the transport equation .    the shortcomings and advantages of using the diffusion equation to describe the propagation of crs are easy to identify : this approach allows one to achieve a basic understanding of some issues ( for instance the spectral steepening induced by the particle propagation and leakage from the galaxy ) .",
    "moreover the approach can be used without limitations in the dynamical range ( particles from very low to very high momenta can be included ) .",
    "on the other hand , the diffusion coefficients are given quantities ; even when the diffusion coefficients ( as functions of particle momentum and spatial location ) are calculated from first principles ( quasi - linear theory ) they are often used in regimes where the initial assumptions do not necessarily hold .",
    "in addition , a multitude of effects related to spatial gradients of the large scale fields are hardly accounted for .",
    "the numerical simulation of the propagation of crs in arbitrary magnetic fields solves part of these problems , but is limited by the constraints on the computational time .",
    "previous investigations using this technique concentrated on very high energy cosmic rays ( @xmath6 ) , and on the deflections produced by their passage into the galactic magnetic field @xcite or on their anisotropy around @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "other attempts investigated lower energies , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite was able to reach down to @xmath8 , and calculated the times of escape from the galaxy as a function of energy .",
    "the results obtained , however , seem to be inconsistent with measurements at low energy .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the escape time at @xmath8 is found to be of the order of @xmath9 with an energy dependence of @xmath10 , much steeper than the one expected for example from a normal kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the extrapolation of this value to @xmath11 produces a value several orders of magnitude larger than the measured one .",
    "the problem of the steepness of the escape time in the simulations seems to be a general one : it is present also in our simulations and seems to continue to lower energies as we discuss below .    in this paper",
    "we describe the numerical code that we recently completed for the propagation of cosmic rays in arbitrary magnetic fields ( both in their large scale and turbulent components ) .",
    "the code represents a substantial improvement on previous efforts in the same direction in several ways : first , we succeeded in propagating the particles down to energies of @xmath12 ev , lower by at least one / two orders of magnitude compared with previous simulations .",
    "second , the turbulence responsible for diffusive particle motion can be taken as three dimensional or one - dimensional , and as isotropic or anisotropic .",
    "the large scale field is also completely arbitrary .",
    "we present the results of this simulation effort in two papers . in the present paper ( paper i )",
    "we discuss all technical aspects and apply the approach to several toy models of the magnetic field of the galaxy in order to emphasize the role of the physical effects that is necessary to include in order to understand the propagation of crs . in a second paper ( paper ii )",
    "we will describe the results of the simulation for given configurations of galactic magnetic fields which are commonly assumed as realistic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : simula ] we describe the technical aspects of the simulation , with special attention to the generation of the turbulent magnetic field . in  [ sec : basic ] we illustrate some basic concepts of diffusion in the context of quasi - linear theory , which allows us to define what is the common lore of cosmic ray propagation in the galaxy in terms of diffusion and drifts . in ",
    "[ sec : diffu ] we describe the numerical procedure adopted to calculate the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : toy ] we describe the results of our computations for several toy models of the large scale field of the galaxy .",
    "we present our conclusions in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we propagate particles in a magnetic field , @xmath13 , that is the sum in each point of a regular and a random component . both of them can in principle depend on the position . as detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite there are basically two methods to implement the turbulent field : 1 ) pre - computing the field on a grid using fast fourier transform ( fft ) and 2 ) calculating the field in each point along the particle trajectory as the superposition of plane waves @xcite .    in",
    "the fft approach the field is pre - computed on a grid in real space from its power spectrum in reciprocal space .",
    "we set up a three dimensional grid with integer coordinates from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "each vertex on the grid corresponds to a wave vector @xmath16 with components given by the coordinates of the vertex .",
    "if any one of the components of @xmath16 , for example @xmath17 , is larger than @xmath18 , then we substitute it with @xmath19 in order to take into account negative frequencies . for each @xmath16",
    "we construct an amplitude vector , @xmath20 , with a length proportional to the square root of the power in the corresponding mode : @xmath21 , a random direction in the plane orthogonal to @xmath16 and a random phase .",
    "choosing the amplitude proportional to @xmath21 makes sure that the power spectrum of the turbulent field is @xmath22 , whereas choosing the direction in the plane orthogonal to @xmath16 assures that @xmath23 .",
    "we also have to make sure that @xmath20 satisfies the following condition for the resulting magnetic field to be real : @xmath24 .",
    "the normalization is obtained by requiring that @xmath25 and @xmath26 is set to @xmath14 to have @xmath27 . at this point",
    "we compute the fft @xcite and obtain the turbulent field defined on a cubic grid with side @xmath28 and spacing @xmath29 .",
    "we typically use @xmath30 .",
    "we assume the box is replicated periodically all over the simulation volume and in order to calculate the turbulent field in a given point the code uses the field value of the closest vertex . another possibility is to do an interpolation of the values at the eight vertexes surrounding the point .",
    "we verified that the results obtained with the two methods are equal on scales larger than the cell size ( @xmath31 ) and we decided to use the former method .",
    "the above description is valid for the general case of isotropic turbulence .",
    "we also used 1d turbulence , a superposition of alfven waves , and in this case the generation proceeds along the same lines , but the @xmath16s are now chosen only parallel to the background field , so that the fluctuating magnetic field is always perpendicular to it . for the 1d field",
    "we typically use @xmath32 .    in the second approach the field is constructed as the sum of @xmath33 plane waves @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are random phases .",
    "the primed coordinates are obtained by rotating the reference frame so that the @xmath38 axis coincides with the direction of propagation of the @xmath39-th wave , @xmath40 .",
    "the directions of the @xmath33 waves are chosen randomly , while their amplitudes , @xmath41 , are chosen as a function of @xmath42 according to the type of turbulence wanted .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and we use : @xmath43^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 in these equations @xmath45 fixes the normalization of the field , @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the correlation length , @xmath3 is the slope of the turbulence power spectrum , @xmath48 is its dimensionality and @xmath49 is the volume element for the chosen dimensionality . in the present paper we use 3d and 1d turbulence and in these cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the wavenumbers are chosen evenly spaced in logarithmic scale between @xmath52 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the number of waves , @xmath33 , used in the summation ( [ eq : gjdeltab ] ) , is a key parameter and it should be large enough to reasonably describe the turbulence . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that if @xmath33 is too small the transition from rectilinear to diffusive propagation occurs on timescales much larger than the correct ones .",
    "it was also found that a value of @xmath55 waves per decade is a reasonable compromise between accuracy and computation time and we use this value in our simulations .",
    "the only difference for the case of 1d turbulence is that instead of choosing the @xmath40 isotropically we choose them in the direction parallel to the background field .",
    "both the methods described have their advantages and disadvantages : with the fft approach the time needed to obtain the turbulent field in a given point is in general much smaller than in the plane wave approach . in the first case all that is required",
    "is a lookup in a table ( and possibly some interpolations ) , whereas in the latter case there is a summation over hundreds of waves to be done . on the other hand , the dynamic range of the turbulence , @xmath56 , in the fft approach is limited ( at least in the isotropic turbulence case ) by the memory available to store the huge matrices describing the magnetic field grid , whereas in the plane wave approach the memory limitations are absent and the dynamic range can be as big as required with the only limit given by the computation time . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , other limitations of the fft approach are inherent in its discreteness , @xmath31 , and in its limited size , @xmath28 , and the results obtained with it can not be trusted when the larmor radius of the particles is smaller than @xmath31 or larger than @xmath28 .",
    "in this section we summarize the basic facts on diffusion of cosmic rays in a turbulent magnetic field superimposed to a large scale spatially constant magnetic field @xmath57 .",
    "gradients in the large scale field induce drift motions of the particles that add to the diffusive motion and in fact in some circumstances may even dominate upon diffusion .      in all the cases that we consider below we investigate 3d turbulence , namely the perturbation of the large scale field has components both in the plane perpendicular to @xmath58 and along @xmath58 .",
    "therefore this case is somewhat more complex but supposedly more realistic than the simpler case of alfven waves propagating along the field @xmath58 ( we refer to this case as the _ 1d case _ ) , typically considered in the literature on quasi - linear theory . in the case of 3d turbulence , the perpendicular diffusion , though small compared with the parallel diffusion in the quasi - linear regime , may become important for the cases of strong turbulence @xmath59 . on the basis of quasi - linear theory",
    "the ratio of perpendicular to parallel diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath60 where the parallel pathlength is @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the particle velocity and @xmath63 is the larmor radius in the unperturbed magnetic field @xmath64 .",
    "this expression remains valid as long as @xmath65 , but it also suggests that the perpendicular diffusion coefficient approaches the parallel diffusion coefficient in the regime of strong turbulence .",
    "in fact the real ratio of the diffusion coefficients is affected by the random walk of the field lines , which is not taken into account in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] .",
    "this fact was found in @xcite and further discussed in @xcite and is illustrated in the next section in detail since it plays a crucial role in the understanding of the results of the simulation of cosmic rays in the galaxy .",
    "the parallel diffusion coefficient can be estimated from the 1d case , by using the quasi - linear theory : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the normalized power in the turbulent modes with wavenumber @xmath68 resonant with the particles with momentum @xmath69 . even in the 3d case",
    "this is a reasonable approximation to the parallel diffusion coefficient since this is dominated by the components of the perturbing field which are perpendicular to the background field . in this case",
    "one can see that the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is @xmath70 since by definition @xmath71 it is easy to see that @xmath72 , which implies that in most cases the effect of perpendicular diffusion is irrelevant if the propagation occurs in the regime of weak turbulence .    in numerical simulations of the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy",
    "it is usually assumed that @xmath73 .",
    "this ratio is supported by general estimates , such as equipartition , cosmic ray behavior and observations of total magnetic field in elliptical galaxies  @xcite , rather than direct observations .",
    "let us assume that the measurement of the abundances of light elements and the estimate of the anisotropy of cosmic rays at low energies may be taken as realistic for the determination of the diffusion properties of the ism .",
    "the anisotropy of cosmic rays at low energies is observed to be at the level of @xmath74 , and in the context of quasi - linear theory ( qlt ) it is of order @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the drift velocity of cosmic rays in the magnetic field of the galaxy .",
    "the condition @xmath77 implies @xmath78 cm / s .",
    "this is in good agreement with the theory again , because in qlt the streaming instability forces the streaming of cosmic rays to occur at bulk velocities lower than the alfven speed , @xmath79 cm / s for @xmath80 and gas density @xmath81 ( this should be considered as an average value over the magnetized halo of the galaxy , say within 3 kpc from the disk ) .",
    "in other words , the anisotropy is exactly what one would expect on the basis of bulk motion of cosmic rays at the alfven speed ( @xmath82 ) . in qlt the pathlength for a particle to suffer a change in direction by 90 degrees is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the gyration frequency of the particle and @xmath85 .",
    "the pathlength @xmath86 determines the confinement time in a region of size @xmath87 as @xmath88 from observations of the abundance of light elements this time is measured to be @xmath89 years , while from the abundance of unstable radioactive isotopes one gets a larger number , @xmath90 years @xcite .",
    "these two numbers correspond respectively to @xmath91 pc and @xmath92 pc . here",
    "we assumed that the magnetized region of the galaxy in the direction perpendicular to the disk has a typical size @xmath93 kpc .",
    "note also that rigorously we may use the parallel diffusion coefficient to estimate the escape from the disk only if the magnetic field is oriented along @xmath38 , which is at odds with the conventional models of galactic magnetic field .",
    "therefore it is worth keeping in mind that a more realistic estimate is likely to differ from the one just illustrated and often used in the literature .    from the equation for @xmath86",
    "one immediately obtains : @xmath94 for @xmath91 pc and @xmath95 for @xmath92 pc . for the numerical evaluation we considered cosmic rays with mean energy @xmath96 gev .",
    "these values of @xmath97 correspond to @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively on the relevant scales . on such scales",
    "it appears that the assumptions of qlt are fulfilled .",
    "if the power spectrum is in the form of a power law , we can write @xmath100 and limit ourselves to the two interesting cases @xmath101 ( kolmogorov spectrum ) and @xmath102 ( kraichnan spectrum ) . in both these cases most power is in the form of modes with the largest spatial scale ( namely at @xmath103 , assumed here to be @xmath104 ) .",
    "the modes of wavenumber @xmath103 resonate with particles with energy @xmath105 ev .",
    "the propagation of particles with energies larger than @xmath106 is described in terms of a diffusion coefficient with a steeper energy dependence than the one discussed here ( bohm diffusion ) and eventually straight line propagation . from the numerical values",
    "obtained above , and assuming that @xmath104 , one easily infers that the power on a scale @xmath103 is @xmath107 for @xmath91 pc and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , and @xmath108 for @xmath92 pc and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "these estimates show that the total power in the turbulent field may be appreciably smaller than unity , which of course affects the normalization of the diffusion coefficient , the confinement time and the expected anisotropy at higher energies .",
    "the main problem with these estimates is that they are based solely upon the parallel diffusion coefficient , which , as discussed below may be incorrect .",
    "the issue of the strength of the turbulent field relative to the strength of the regular field remains therefore open .",
    "it is worth stressing that for @xmath101 the diffusion approximation is broken at @xmath109 ev when @xmath110 and @xmath111 ev when @xmath112 .",
    "for @xmath102 we have @xmath113 ev for @xmath91 pc and @xmath114 ev for @xmath92 pc .",
    "this implies that at energy @xmath115 the anisotropy is expected to become of order unity . among all cases considered , the only case that seems to be compatible with the fact that no large anisotropy is observed up to the knee is the case @xmath101 and @xmath112 .",
    "note that this does not necessarily imply that a large anisotropy should be observed at @xmath111 ev , since at this energy the chemical composition in the galaxy is expected to be contaminated by heavy elements , which are as isotropic as the particles with energy @xmath116 . despite the interesting conclusion , this has to be considered just as a hint , because of the several assumptions that enter the previous estimate ( for instance the value of @xmath87 and @xmath103 and assumptions about geometry of the system ) .",
    "the predicted escape time from the galaxy as a function of energy is more solidly predicted to be @xmath117 for kolmogorov spectrum and @xmath118 for kraichnan spectrum .",
    "it is worth stressing that this simple prediction , widely used in the literature , completely neglects the possibility of perpendicular diffusion or when it is not neglected , the assumption is adopted that the scaling with energy of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is the same as for the parallel diffusion coefficient .",
    "unfortunately , as we show below , the role of perpendicular diffusion in the galaxy is likely to be crucial .",
    "gradients in the modulus or orientation of the large scale field @xmath119 induce drift motions in the direction perpendicular to both the local field and its gradient .",
    "the drift velocity of the guiding center can be written as @xcite :    @xmath120}{b_0 ^ 3 }      \\big\\}\\\\      & = & c r_l \\big\\ {      \\frac{1}{2 } \\sin^2\\alpha      \\frac{\\boldsymbol{b_0}\\times\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}b_0}{b_0 ^ 2}+      \\cos^2\\alpha\\big [      \\frac{\\boldsymbol{b_0}\\times\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}b_0}{b_0 ^ 2}+      \\frac{\\big(\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\times\\boldsymbol{b_0}\\big)_\\perp}{b_0 }      \\big ]      \\big\\}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath121 is the pitch angle of the particle .",
    "the first term in this expression reflects the transverse gradient of the field strength while the second term represents the effect of the curvature of the field lines .",
    "the above expression should be interpreted as the drift velocity averaged over a gyration period of the particle . as an estimate of the order of magnitude of the time scale for escape from the region of size @xmath87 due to drift motion , we can write @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the spatial scale on which the gradient in the magnetic field appears .",
    "this expression clearly shows that if the drifts are relevant at all this may happen only at very high energies .",
    "three toy models are particularly interesting as far as drifts are concerned and will be discussed in detail in ",
    "[ sec : toy2 ] ,  [ sec : toy3 ] and  [ sec : toy4 ] . here",
    "we limit our discussion to the expected effects of drift motions .",
    "the first model ( toy model ii in  [ sec : toy3 ] ) has only spatially constant ( in modulus ) azimuthal magnetic field . in this case",
    "the field lines are simply concentric circles in @xmath124 planes .",
    "the only gradient is due to the curvature of the magnetic field lines and the drift velocity is given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the unit vector in the @xmath38 direction , @xmath127 is the distance ( in kpc ) from the center in the plane @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the particle energy in units of @xmath130 ev .",
    "clearly this expression and the ones we will list below are valid as long as the spatial scale of the gradient is much larger than the larmor radius of the particles .",
    "this condition also assures that the drift velocity is always smaller than the speed of light . from eq .",
    "[ eq : drift1 ] one can see that the drift pushes the particles perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the second toy model that we will consider is similar to the previous one but with the strength of the magnetic field having a gradient along the @xmath127 direction ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : brad ] ) .",
    "it is easy to predict that also in this case the drift velocity is oriented along the @xmath126 direction .",
    "the drift velocity in this case is @xmath131 finally , in the third toy model we assume that the magnetic field is still azimuthal but is constant in the @xmath128 plane and has a gradient in the @xmath126 direction ( see eq .",

    "is that the magnetic field lines are closed loops : the magnetic field strength is spatially constant but the orientation of the field changes as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : baz ] .",
    "the fact that the field lines are closed implies a straightforward but important conclusion : the particles can not escape the cylinder by diffusing parallel to the magnetic field lines .",

    "the straight line represents the drift time calculated from eq .",

    "it is worth noticing that the actual drift times have a very extended tail towards large times , due to the dependence of this quantity on the angle of injection of the particles with respect to the large scale local field .",
    "the black lines and dots are the diffusion time scales , @xmath176 , where the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is taken from the simulations described in  [ sec : diffu ] .    a general comment about the relative role of parallel and perpendicular diffusion is in order : parallel diffusion is more effective than perpendicular even in the case of strong turbulence considered here , but it only leads to motion of the particles along the closed magnetic field lines .",
    "perpendicular diffusion , though much slower , is responsible for particle escape in the direction perpendicular to the disk ( there is also some escape from the sides of the cylinder but this process is less efficient because the sides are @xmath177 kpc away from the location of the earth , while the halo has been assumed to be only @xmath170 kpc thick ) .",
    "the parallel with the galaxy is very instructive in this instance : particles diffuse effectively along the spiral arms , whose length is roughly @xmath178 kpc long ( at the distance of the sun from the galactic center ) .",

    "the energy dependence which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : baz_times ] reflects the energy dependence of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient , which in the relevant energy range can be approximated as @xmath184 .",
    "it is instructive that such a slope , usually associated ( at low energies ) to a kraichnan spectrum of turbulence ( parallel diffusion ) can in fact be achieved with a kolmogorov perpendicular diffusion ( at least in the high energy range we are able to treat here ) .",
    "the important role of perpendicular diffusion in determining the escape time is also shown by the absolute normalization of the curves in fig . [",
    "fig : baz_times ] . for parallel diffusion , at least in the quasi - linear regime",
    ", one expects the diffusion coefficient to decrease while increasing @xmath160 , so that the escape times increase . in our toy model",
    "the perpendicular diffusion coefficient in fact increases with increasing @xmath160 .    aside from diffusion ,",
    "the escape times are also affected by drift motions .",
    "in particular , drifts become important where the drift time ( the straight line in fig .",
    "[ fig : baz_times ] ) becomes of the same order of magnitude of the diffusion times ( black lines ) .",
    "for @xmath185 this happens at energies around @xmath186 ev , while drift seems irrelevant for stronger levels of turbulence . besides this effect , which is rather clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : baz_times ] , there is a more subtle effect induced by drifts , which is evident in the low energy part of the curve for @xmath187 .",
    "one can notice that the black line illustrating the effect of diffusion ( for @xmath187 ) lies below the upward red triangles obtained in the simulation . in order to understand the reason for this apparent problem , we calculated the escape times in the case in which the earth is located at 85 kpc from the center instead of 8.5 kpc . in this case",
    "the cylinder is larger but it has the same height .",
    "but more important the curvature of the magnetic field lines is reduced appreciably so that the drift velocity drops correspondingly .",
    "one can see that the low energy behaviour in this case ( upward light blue triangles ) agrees well with the black curve , therefore confirming that the reason for the slim disagreement has something to do with the curvature of the field lines .    to achieve a better understanding of the modifications the drifts produce to the diffusion process we calculated the diffusion coefficients in this geometry and we found that the drifts are modifying the two perpendicular diffusion coefficients reducing the one along @xmath38 and increasing the one along @xmath127 .",
    "in fact one should keep in mind that the concepts of parallel and perpendicular diffusion were introduced here with reference to the specific case of a large scale coherent background field , with no intrinsic curvature of the field lines . when the field lines are curved , then the definition itself of parallel and perpendicular diffusion changes , as discussed in detail in [ appendix ] .    at energy @xmath5 ev",
    "the larmor radius of the particles equals the maximum wavelength in the power spectrum of the turbulent field and the diffusion regime changes , gradually shifting toward the straight line propagation , which in fig .",
    "[ fig : baz_times ] corresponds to the extreme right , flat part of the curves for the escape time .",
    "it is worth reminding the reader that all these considerations remain valid for heavier nuclei once the energy is substituted by rigidity .",
    "we conclude this discussion of the second toy model with a comment on the absolute magnitude of the escape time .",
    "though keeping in mind that this is a toy model of the magnetic field of the galaxy , we believe that some qualitative conclusions can be drawn . at energy @xmath0 ev the escape time for the cases considered here is @xmath188 million years ( the halo height here is only @xmath170 kpc ) .",
    "these numbers are of the same order of magnitude of the confinement times estimated from the abundance of light element in the @xmath189 region , which means that in order to fit these observations one should postulate that the escape time below @xmath0 ev should be practically energy independent .",
    "we could not envision any realistic mechanism able to justify such an expectation .",
    "it follows that within the limitations of the toy model 2 it is very hard to obtain a realistic , even qualitative , description of what is observed in the galaxy at much lower energies .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed also by the curves on the grammage : at @xmath0 ev cosmic rays traverse a column density of @xmath190 . as we discuss below",
    ", this conclusion is the same for the other toy models considered here .      the global structure of the large scale azimuthal field",
    "is not changed with respect to toy model ii , but we introduce here a gradient of the modulus of the large scale field with the radial coordinate @xmath127 measured in the @xmath192 plane .",
    "the radial dependence of the field is assumed to be in the form : @xmath193 where @xmath127 is the radius in cylindrical coordinates in units of kpc .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : drifts ] , in this case the drift velocity is still oriented in the @xmath126 direction , therefore the drift due to a gradient of the strength of the field behaves qualitatively as the gradient due to the curvature in the field lines , discussed in the section above .",
    "the escape time and the grammage for this case are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : baz_rho_times ] , where the red dashed line indicates the drift timescale , again calculated using the average drift velocity . at the distance of the earth",
    "the gradient due to the radial dependence reduces the drift time by roughly a factor 2 , thereby making the line for the drift time scale almost touch the red triangles ( @xmath187 ) . for stronger levels of turbulence",
    "the drifts become basically irrelevant , even at the highest energies . the absolute normalizations of the time scales",
    "are affected very little by the radial gradient of @xmath194 , therefore most comments made for toy model 2 are valid here too .",
    "we conclude this section by investigating the case of an azimuthal field with a gradient along @xmath195 , as described by the following expression : @xmath196 with @xmath197 kpc or @xmath198 kpc . in this case",

    "the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy still presents us with numerous open questions .",
    "the standard lore goes as follows : if the sources of galactic cosmic rays ( possibly but not necessarily supernova remnants ) inject a spectrum @xmath203 with @xmath204 , then diffusion of these cosmic rays in the magnetic field of the galaxy leads to an equilibrium spectrum which is @xmath205 , where the diffusion coefficient is taken in the form @xmath206 . for a kolmogorov spectrum of magnetic fluctuations",
    "@xmath207 , while for a kraichnan spectrum @xmath208 . of course these statements apply at energies lower than the maximum energy of the accelerated particles , which for protons is expected to be @xmath209 ev . however , if the maximum energy of the accelerated particles were much larger , in principle the same conclusions would extend up to the energy for which the larmor radius equals the coherence scale of the field , which is typically taken to be @xmath210 pc .",
    "this corresponds to energy @xmath211 ev for a magnetic field @xmath212 .",
    "the simulations illustrated in this paper can be performed for proton energies @xmath213 ev ( in a few cases @xmath214",
    "ev ) , therefore for at least two decades in energy we should be able to test the standard lore sketched above .",
    "we confirm that this is the case by considering a toy model with only a turbulent field with given power spectrum , in which case we are in perfect agreement with the expectations .",
    "the problems arise as soon as any complication is added to this simple scenario .",
    "we illustrate our points by considering other three toy models , each having a specific feature which is supposed to be resemblant of a corresponding feature expected to be present in the actual galactic magnetic field . in particular we consider a benchmark situation in which the galactic field is taken to have a perfectly azimuthal geometry , so that the magnetic field lines are closed loops .",
    "we showed how in such a geometry the role of perpendicular diffusion in the escape of particles from the toy galaxy is crucial and leads to escape times which are too long to be reconciled with the observed confinement times at much lower energies .",
    "this conclusion should remain valid in the case in which the magnetic field lines follow the spiral arms rather than being closed , since the arms are in any case much larger in length than the size of the halo .",
    "an important piece of information should be added : the escape times that we plotted throughout the paper are all meant to be the average of the log of the escape times .",
    "the spread around these mean values are very large , covering about one order of magnitude .",
    "such spreads do not reflect limitations in the statistics of the propagated particles : they are rather stable if the number of particles is increased .",
    "the fluctuations are due to the several possible histories that may characterize the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean values used to infer our conclusions are very stable .",
    "another important ingredient of the magnetic field configuration with closed magnetic field lines consists of the drift motions induced on the particles by the gradients in the direction of the local large scale field .",
    "the effect of drift is especially evident for high energies and low levels of turbulence .",
    "similar drifts are introduced by gradients in the @xmath38 and @xmath127 directions .",
    "the most important conclusion that we could achieve is that the dominant role of the perpendicular diffusion in a geometry with a prominent azimuthal magnetic field makes the expectation of the common lore hard to realize .",
    "the energy dependence of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is not the same as that of the parallel diffusion coefficient : more specifically in the lower energy regime it scales as @xmath215 , rather than @xmath216 as would be expected for a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "unfortunately we are not able to follow this behaviour down to energies below @xmath0 ev . in any case , at @xmath217 ev , the escape times that we _ measured _ in the simulation are always too large to be extrapolated down to the few million years inferred from the abundance of light elements in the gev energy region , even admitting that a flattening to a behaviour @xmath218 of the escape times could be achieved below @xmath217 ev .",
    "it is interesting to speculate about possible physical effects that might cause the escape time to be reduced . from the discussion above ,",
    "it is clear that reducing the level of turbulence ( namely the value of @xmath219 ) does not help , since this would cause the perpendicular diffusion to decrease , thereby increasing the escape times even more . making the halo have a smaller scale height does help , but it appears rather unrealistic to reduce this scale below @xmath170 kpc ( observations of the radio background from synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons hint to a typical scale height of a few kpc @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility that we will discuss more quantitatively in paper ii is that of a galactic wind , possibly injected by cosmic rays themselves : in this case , in addition to the diffusive motion , particles would have a systematic drift velocity pushing them away from the disc of the galaxy . if the typical wind velocity is @xmath220 @xcite ,",
    "then the typical escape time due to advection is of order 5 million years , independent of momentum .",
    "it is important to notice that for the diffusion coefficients used in the literature ( in the common lore usually one does not distinguish between parallel and perpendicular ) this is roughly the escape time scale for cosmic rays in the gev energy region , therefore the effect of the wind is usually relevant only for low energy particles ( at higher energies the escape is dominated by diffusion ) . in the scenarios that we find ,",
    "escape is due to perpendicular diffusion , and takes place on much longer time scales as we have seen , therefore the effect of the wind can be that of producing a roughly energy independent escape time of the order of @xmath221 million years .",
    "unfortunately this does not appear to be the correct , or at least the complete , picture either .",
    "in fact the escape time is observed to be a function of energy @xmath222 , as shown by the energy dependence of the secondary to primary ratio ( e.g. @xcite ) , although these measurements have so far been carried out only up to energies of the order of @xmath223 mev / nucleon .",

    "the only unexpected feature is in the two highest energy curves , corresponding to @xmath146 and @xmath232 that show a steepening around @xmath234 .",
    "this steepening is simply due to the fact that at high energies and large propagation times some of the particles have enough time to complete half a circle around the `` galaxy '' and since to measure the parallel displacement we are using @xmath229 , particles with @xmath235 end up in the wrong place in the histogram and distort the distribution .",
    "this is not however a physical effect and it is just a glitch of the method used to estimate the parallel displacement and we can just trow away the last few points and do the average with the remaining ones .",
    "the diffusion coefficient along @xmath38 shows a tiny sub - diffusion at low energies , @xmath236 , that disappears by increasing the particle energy .",
