    "since ariki s proof @xcite of the llt conjecture @xcite , it is understood that higher level fock spaces representations of @xmath0 have , via categorification , a very important impact on our understanding of some structures related to complex reflection groups .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath1 is the level @xmath2 fock space representation of @xmath0 with multicharge @xmath3 and @xmath4 the irreducible highest weight submodule of @xmath1 of weight @xmath5 ( determined by @xmath3 ) , then one can compute the decomposition numbers for the corresponding ariki - koike algebra by specialising at @xmath6 kashiwara s canonical basis of @xmath4 .",
    "the fock space itself is no longer irreducible , but one can however define a canonical basis for it , which turns out to give , at @xmath6 , the decomposition numbers of a corresponding @xmath7-schur algebra , as was proved by varagnolo and vasserot @xcite , hence generalising ariki s result .    the introduction of quiver hecke algebras by rouquier @xcite and by khovanov and lauda @xcite has shed some new light about the role of the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , quiver hecke algebras are graded , and graded versions of these results ( which do not require to specialise @xmath7 at @xmath8 ) hold for these structures , see @xcite .",
    "moreover , ariki s categorification theorem also permits to interpret the kashiwara crystal of @xmath4 as the branching rule for the associated ariki - koike algebra .",
    "shan has proved in @xcite that the crystal of the whole fock space is also categorified by a branching rule , but for another structure , namely a corresponding cyclotomic rational cherednik algebra .",
    "very recently , dudas , varagnolo and vasserot @xcite have proved a similar result suggested by gerber , hiss and jacon @xcite in the context of finite unitary groups . in this case , there is a notion of parabolic ( or harish - chandra ) induction for unipotent representations which , provided one works with the appropriate levi subgroups , defines a branching graph which also categorifies the crystal of @xmath1 .    therefore , the study of @xmath1 , and in particular of its crystal structure ( which yields the theory of canonical bases in kashiwara s approach @xcite ) is crucial for approaching fundamental problems in the representation theory of many classical algebraic structures .    in uglov s paper @xcite , canonical bases of higher level fock spaces have been thoroughly studied , generalising leclerc and thibon s level one results in @xcite and @xcite . in his work",
    ", the fock space is identified to a subspace of the space of semi - infinite @xmath7-wedges @xmath9 .",
    "this space @xmath9 is essentially the direct sum of all fock spaces @xmath1 over all @xmath2-charges @xmath3 whose components sum up to @xmath10",
    ". three algebras act on @xmath9 : two quantum groups , namely @xmath0 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , and a heisenberg algebra @xmath13 .",
    "a fundamental result is that these three actions are pairwise commutative ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.6 ) , and that the fock space can be decomposed in a very simple way : it suffices to act on the empty multipartition by the three algebras for some restricted values of the multicharge to reach any vector ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.8 ) .",
    "this emphasizes the relevance of considering @xmath9 not only as a @xmath0-module , but also as a @xmath11-module and as a @xmath13-module .",
    "this triple module structure is well - defined because one has a three natural ways to index the elements of @xmath9 : either by partitions , by @xmath2-partitions , or by @xmath14-partitions .",
    "the action of @xmath11 is understood provided the correspondence between @xmath2-partitions and @xmath14-partitions is known , which is the case ( it is explicit and based on taking @xmath14-quotients and `` modified '' @xmath2-quotients ) .",
    "this double quantum group structure is referred to as `` level - rank '' duality , and has been investigated in particular in the works of rouquier , shan , varagnolo and vasserot @xcite and webster @xcite .",
    "the action of @xmath13 has been less studied , but has recently been proved to have important applications when it comes to the representation theory of rational cherednik algebras .",
    "more precisely , shan and vasserot @xcite have categorified the heisenberg action on the fock space , and used it to characterise finite - dimensional simple modules for the corresponding cyclotomic cherednik algebra . in a recent preprint @xcite",
    ", losev has given a combinatorial interpretation of this categorical action , but without using uglov s approach to the fock space . finally , in the context of @xcite and @xcite , some combinatorial observations suggest that @xmath13 might play a role in the study of unipotent representations of finite unitary groups , by relating the notion of weak cuspidality to the classical one .",
    "however , uglov s work says very little about crystals , and it is not clear how level - rank duality nor the action of @xmath13 is expressed at the crystal level .    the aim of this paper two - fold .",
    "first , complete uglov s study of higher level fock spaces at the crystal level .",
    "this is achieved by explicitely determining a triple crystal structure which yields a nice decomposition of the whole crystal in the spirit of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.6 ) and",
    "* theorem 4.8 ) .",
    "this requires to make explicit the @xmath11-crystal structure commuting with the @xmath0-crystal , and to define an appropriate notion of _ heisenberg crystal _ which shall commute with both affine quantum group crystals .",
    "second , place it into the context of the representation theory of cherednik algebras to deduce new results using explicit combinatorics . in order to do this",
    ", we must in particular prove a compatibily with a recent result of losev @xcite . throughout the paper",
    ", we will give a significant amount of examples to illustrate the various notions and procedures that we introduce .",
    "this article contains the following main points . in section 2",
    ", we recall the important combinatorial notions used in all the paper , in particular uglov s algorithms which permit to juggle the different indexations of the semi - infinite @xmath7-wedges",
    ". this section does not contain any new material , however we take some time to introduce all notions carefully .    in section 3 ,",
    "we recall the @xmath0-module structure on higher level fock space which was explicited in @xcite .",
    "note that this requires an order on @xmath15-boxes of multipartitions which gives the so - called `` uglov '' realisation of the fock space , which is not consensual in the literature ( cf remark [ bk ] ) .",
    "we also introduce the conjugation procedure , which is capital , and the correspondence ( [ indexation ] ) .",
    "essentially , it enables to put a new @xmath0- and @xmath11-structure on the fock space , which is the appropriate one for our purpose of studying crystals .",
    "section 4 gives a crystal version of level - rank duality .",
    "the @xmath11-crystal graph rule commuting with the classic @xmath0-crystal is explicited ( theorem [ thm_comm_crystal ] ) .",
    "the crystal operators of @xmath11 therefore give @xmath0-crystal isomorphisms in level @xmath2 fock spaces , adding to the list in @xcite .",
    "it is explicit and easy to describe on @xmath2-partitions .",
    "the use of correspondence ( [ indexation ] ) is indispensable .    in section 5 , we study `` doubly highest weight vertices '' , that is to say , vertices that are simultaneously highest weight vertices in the @xmath0-crystal and in the @xmath11-crystal .",
    "we use a result of jacon and lecouvey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.9 ) to characterise these multipartitions , and then give some essential properties .",
    "the proofs there are quite technical and require a careful analysis of the correspondence ( [ indexation ] ) .",
    "section 6 is devoted to defining the heisenberg crystal .",
    "we start by introducing maps @xmath16 and @xmath17 which shift periods to the left and to the right respectively in the abacus representation of a multipartition .",
    "these are simultaneously @xmath0- and @xmath11-crystal isomorphisms .",
    "the heisenberg crystal is then defined as a graph where the arrows are given by the action of `` heisenberg operators '' which are refined versions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we end with a decomposition theorem ( theorem [ thm_crys_decomp ] ) which is an analogue of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.8 ) .    finally , section 7 relates the various results of the previous sections to the representation theory of rational cherednik algebras .",
    "we first give an general interpretation of the crystal level - rank duality .",
    "then , we show that losev s independent results on the crystal version of the heisenberg action @xcite are compatible with those of section 6 , this is theorem [ thm_losev2 ] .",
    "this enables us to give an explicit characterisation of the finite - dimensional simple modules for the cyclotomic rational cherednik algebras using the notion of flotw multipartitions ( theorem [ thm_cher ] ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a positive integer . an _ @xmath2-charge _ ( or simply multicharge ) is an @xmath2-tuple @xmath18 of integers .",
    "an _ @xmath2-partition _ ( or simply multipartition ) is an @xmath2-tuple @xmath19 of partitions .",
    "one considers that a partition has an infinite number of size zero parts .",
    "the set of partition will be denoted by @xmath20 and the set of @xmath2-partitions by @xmath21 .",
    "the rank of @xmath22 is the sum of the ranks of the partitions @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "a charged @xmath2-partition is the data of an @xmath2-charge @xmath3 and an @xmath2-partition @xmath22 , denoted @xmath25 .",
    "it can be represented by an @xmath2-tuple of young diagrams ( corresponding to @xmath22 ) , whose boxes @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the row of the box , @xmath28 is its column and @xmath29 its component ) are filled with the integers @xmath30 .",
    "this integer is called the _ content _ of the box @xmath26 .",
    "[ exa_chargedmp ] take @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath34      equivalently , one can use @xmath35-graded abacci to represent a charged multipartition , following @xcite . given a charged @xmath2-partition @xmath25 ,",
    "we can compute , for each @xmath36 , the numbers @xmath37 for @xmath38 where the @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the parts of @xmath23 .",
    "for each @xmath29 , this give a set of @xmath41-numbers for @xmath42 in the sense of @xcite , which is infinite by the convention that @xmath23 has an infinite number of size zero parts .",
    "note that these @xmath41-numbers are precisely the `` virtual '' contents that appear just to the right of the border of @xmath25 in its young diagram representation .",
    "formally , we define the abacus @xmath43 to be the subset of @xmath44 defined by @xmath45 we can depict @xmath43 by drawing @xmath2 horizontal @xmath35-graded rows , numbered from bottom to top , and by drawing a bead on row @xmath29 at position @xmath46 for all @xmath24 and for all @xmath38 .",
    "take the same values as example [ exa_chargedmp ] .",
    "then the @xmath41-numbers are given by @xmath47 and we get the following abacus     [ ab15 ]    from this abacus , one recovers the @xmath2-charge by shifting all beads to the left and by looking at the position of the rightmost bead on each row ; and the partition @xmath23 ( for all @xmath48 ) by counting the number of empty spots to the left of each bead on the @xmath29-th row .      in this section , we want @xmath49 and we fix another integer @xmath50 .",
    "following uglov @xcite , we explain a way to associate to a charged @xmath2-partition a charged @xmath8-partition , as well as a charged @xmath14-partition .",
    "consider the @xmath2-abacus representing a charged @xmath2-partition @xmath25 .",

    ". then one can show ( see @xcite ) that @xmath58 is a bijection between @xmath44 and @xmath59 , and we denote @xmath60 its inverse ( whose formula can also be explicited ) .",

    "we illustrate these procedures on example [ exa_chargedmp ] .",
    "take for instance @xmath72 .",
    "we see in figure [ ab16 ] that @xmath60 `` stacks horizontally '' the elements of @xmath73 into rectangles of height @xmath2 and width @xmath14 , and that @xmath66 `` stacks vertically '' the elements of @xmath73 into rectangles of height @xmath14 and width @xmath2 .",
    "notice also that the composition @xmath74 consists in flipping each rectangle through the diagonal joining the top lef corner to the bottom right corner , and then  ` regluing' the rectangles to get an abacus .     and",

    "the _ @xmath14-core _ of @xmath76 is obtained after shifting all beads of @xmath69 to the left and computing the associated partition using @xmath77 .",
    "note finally that this does not hold for @xmath60 ( the definitions of @xmath60 and @xmath66 are different ) .",
    "we keep the notations of the previous section .",

    "hence , the partition @xmath551 is of the form @xmath552 for some non - negative integers @xmath553 .",
    "notice that this partition @xmath554 is constructed in a similar way as the partition @xmath335 for doubly highest weight vertices ( except that for @xmath554 , one focuses exclusively on the @xmath280-th component of @xmath25 ) .",
    "we will show in theorem [ thm_losev2 ] that @xmath554 is in fact the partition @xmath335 associated to the corresponding doubly highest weight vertex .",
    "let us now recal the result of losev that is relevant in our context .",
    "let @xmath3 be an @xmath280-asymptotic @xmath2-charge , and @xmath25 be a highest weight vertex in the @xmath0-crystal such that @xmath555 ( cf lemma [ lem_losev ] above ) .",

    "* section 5.1.2 and proposition 5.3 ) .      1 .",
    "the depth of @xmath25 in the @xmath541-crystal is equal to the rank of @xmath554 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath556 and @xmath471 is a partition such that @xmath557 , then @xmath558 , where @xmath559 for all @xmath560 , and @xmath561 .",
    "3 .   the @xmath541-crystal commutes with the @xmath0-crystal .    here",
    ", we have slightly `` rephrased '' the original result of losev . in particular , the notion of asymptoticity must be reversed in order to be compatible with the language of fock space , as well as the convention on `` multiplicating / dividing '' of partitions by @xmath14 ( one recovers losev s convention by conjugating , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.5 ) ) .",
    "one first thing to notice is that losev s formula for @xmath542 is similar to the formula of the operators @xmath17 of section [ heiscrys ] ( shifting @xmath14-periods to the right ) .",
    "however , one sees that the property of being asymptotic is somehow antagonistic to the property of being a doubly highest weight vertex .",
    "more precisely , a doubly highest weight vertex can never be asymptotic ; and conversely , an asymptotic multipartition can never be a doubly highest weight vertex ( except for the trivial cases ) .",
    "this is clear for instance looking at proposition [ prop_charge ] .",
    "still , we have explained how to extend the definition of the new operators to the whole set of partitions , in ( [ inducedbtilde ] ) . in this section",
    ", we will show that the operator @xmath542 actually coincides with @xmath17 for all partition @xmath371 .",
    "moreover , we show that the partition @xmath554 arising in the asymptotic case is in fact equal to the partition @xmath335 arising in the doubly highest weight vertex case .",
    "note that the maps @xmath390 and @xmath16 implicitely then corresponds to taking the inverse maps to @xmath568 and @xmath569 .    for every asymptotic charged @xmath2-partition @xmath25 which is a highest weight vertex in the @xmath0-crystal , one can consider the corresponding doubly highest weight vertex .",
    "one can apply to it an operator @xmath16 , and go back in the @xmath11-crystal to get the corresponding @xmath2-partition @xmath570 ( cf procedure ( [ inducedbtilde ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , the propagation in the @xmath11-crystal turns out to have a nice description : acting by @xmath16 and by @xmath17 on @xmath25 is combinatorially `` the same '' as acting on doubly highest weight vertices ( i.e. shifting @xmath14-periods to the left ) , as is stated in the next proposition .",
    "[ prop_losev_1 ] let @xmath25 be a highest weight vertex in the @xmath0-crystal .",
    "write @xmath571 for the corresponding doubly highest weight vertex , and set @xmath572",
    ". then @xmath25 has at least @xmath266 non - trivial periods , and    1 .",
    "@xmath16 acts on @xmath25 by shifting the @xmath227-th period of @xmath43 by @xmath573 steps to the left , for all @xmath574 , starting from @xmath575 and finishing by @xmath576 , 2 .   if @xmath577 , then for all partition @xmath578 , @xmath442 acts on @xmath25 by shifting the @xmath227-th period of @xmath43 by @xmath470 steps to the right , for all @xmath579 , starting from @xmath580 and finishing by @xmath576 .",
    "note that in the case @xmath581 , this procedure coincides with the procedure for @xmath16 described in definition [ def_btildepart ] .",
    "the subtlety here is that we might have more than @xmath266 non - trivial periods in @xmath25 , so we have to modify the statement .",
    "this being said , the action remains very explicit .",
    "we have already explained in section [ comm_crystals ] how the crystal operators @xmath582 of @xmath11 act on the @xmath2-abacus , see theorem [ thm_comm_crystal ] and example [ exa_comm_crystals ] .",
    "they are @xmath0-crystal isomorphisms , and in fact they transform an @xmath14-period @xmath583 of @xmath584 into another @xmath14-period @xmath585 , where either      this is true because @xmath584 is totally @xmath14-periodic ( and so are all elements in the @xmath11-crystal ) .",
    "we see directly that such a procedure can only preserve the number of periods , or make it increase , proving the opening statement .",
    "let us prove point ( 1 ) .",
    "we first need to show that it is possible to apply the shifting procedure in the proposition , that is to say , that each element of the @xmath266-th period has at least @xmath592 empty spots to its left , and so on ( formally , @xmath593 , and so on , if @xmath297 denotes the @xmath227-th period in @xmath43 ) . by contradiction , suppose that applying the operator @xmath582 to a highest weight vertex in the @xmath0-crystal moves a bead of a period @xmath297 in the abacus to a spot @xmath549 ( @xmath55 and meaning @xmath594 if @xmath595 ) such that a period @xmath596 , with @xmath597 , contains an element of the form @xmath598 and has exactly @xmath599 empty spots to its left .",
    "in this case , the element @xmath598 creates a @xmath170 in the @xmath29-word @xmath600 , which directly simplifies with the @xmath169 created by the bead that is moved by @xmath582 , which is a contradiction .",
    "in fact , this procedure indeed gives the crystal action of the heisenberg algebra for the highest weight vertices in the @xmath0-crystal .",
    "it suffices to notice that shifting the considered @xmath14-periods preserves the reduced @xmath29-words @xmath601 , because this amounts to potentially make subwords of the form @xmath173 collapse .",
    "in addition , one observes that @xmath582 acts on the modified @xmath2-abacus by moving the bead corresponding to the bead of the original abacus @xmath602 which is moved by @xmath582 .",
    "this is the same as applying the procedure to @xmath603 . because @xmath16 is a @xmath11-crystal isomorphism ( proposition [ prop_btildekappa ] ) , this procedure is indeed the action of @xmath16 on @xmath2-abacci .",
    "in fact , we first show that the @xmath17 and @xmath542 coincide on highest weight vertices in the @xmath0-crystal which are @xmath280-asymptotic for some @xmath543 .",
    "this is enough because we know that in both cases , the maps commute with the crystal operators of @xmath0 ( theorem [ thm_heis_op ] for @xmath17 and theorem [ thm_losev ] for @xmath542 ) .",
    "every such charged @xmath2-partition @xmath25 is obtained from a doubly highest weight vertex by applying a sequence of kashiwara crystal operators @xmath606 . by proposition [ prop_losev_1 ] ,",
    "we know how these operators act . in the asymptotic case , if @xmath557 ( where the @xmath228 comes from the asymptotic property ) , applying @xmath442 only affects the @xmath280-th row of @xmath43 . moreover , the shifting procedure on abacci described in proposition [ prop_losev_1 ] is exactly losev s formula for @xmath607 on charged @xmath2-partitions , see theorem [ thm_losev ] .",
    "so we have @xmath604 for all partition @xmath371 .",
    "similarly , the action of @xmath16 is entirely described on the @xmath280-th row of @xmath43 , and the procedure of proposition [ prop_losev_1 ] on abacci is in this case precisely the reverse procedure of losev s formula for @xmath608 on @xmath2-partitions , with @xmath605 .",
    "therefore , @xmath609 . in particular , the depth of @xmath25 in the heisenberg crystal is by definition @xmath610 .",
    "one of the important results of shan and vasserot in @xcite is proposition 5.18 , which gives a characterisation of the finite - dimensional simple modules for cyclotomic rational cherednik algebras .",
    "they show that this property is equivalent to being `` primitive '' .",
    "combinatorially , this amounts to saying that the @xmath2-partition labelling this module is simultaneously a highest weight vertex in the @xmath0-crystal and in the heisenberg crystal , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1.1 ) .    using the results of section [ crys_decomp ]",
    ", we can give an explicit combinatorial description of these @xmath2-partitions .",
    "for this , recall that we have introduced the notion of flotw @xmath14-partitions in definition [ def_flotw ] , and that we can use the correspondence ( [ indexation ] ) between @xmath2-partitions charged by @xmath3 and @xmath14-partitions charged by @xmath611 .",
    "as already explained , a simple @xmath528-module is finite - dimensional if and only if it is labelled by an @xmath2-partition @xmath22 of rank @xmath274 such that @xmath25 is a highest weight vertex in the @xmath0-crystal and @xmath62 is a highest weight vertex in the heisenberg crystal , i.e. @xmath612 .",
    "assume first that @xmath25 is a highest weight vertex in the @xmath0-crystal and @xmath486 is a highest weight vertex in the heisenberg crystal .",
    "then with the notation of theorem [ thm_crys_decomp ] , we have @xmath613 and @xmath614 , thus @xmath615 where @xmath616 . by theorem",
    "[ thm_flotw ] , @xmath617 , i.e. is flotw .",
    "conversely , if @xmath122 is an flotw @xmath14-partition , then there exist some @xmath618 such that @xmath619 , for some @xmath616 .",
    "then for all @xmath488 , we have @xmath620 and for all @xmath82 , @xmath621 so @xmath25 is a highest weight vertex in the @xmath0-crystal and @xmath62 is a highest weight vertex in the heisenberg crystal .",
