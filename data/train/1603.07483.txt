    "the pairing correlation between like nucleons , that is , the spin - singlet isovector @xmath8 pairing , is a crucial part of the correlations in the nuclear many - body system , which comes from the short - range part of nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "it is essential for understanding the various properties of open - shell nuclei , such as odd - even mass staggering , deformation properties , large energy gaps between the ground and @xmath9 states in the even - even systems , the moment of inertia of deformed nuclei .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in spite of the strong attraction in @xmath10 channel which makes the deuteron bound , the spin - triplet @xmath7 coupling configuration is considered to be severely hindered in most of the stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "there are mainly three reasons for this .",
    "firstly , the spin - orbit splitting makes it unfavorable to form a @xmath3 pair consisting of the coherent mixture of @xmath11 and @xmath12 configurations , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are spin - orbit partners of each other .",
    "secondly , the recoupling of angular momenta from @xmath15 to @xmath16coupling schemes effectively quenches the pairing interaction more in the @xmath17 channel than in the @xmath18 channel @xcite .",
    "lastly , the neutron excess of the stable nuclei prevents valence protons and neutrons from making @xmath19 pairs because they occupy different orbitals around the fermi energy .",
    "as the progress of radio - isotope beam facilities allows to access nuclei near the @xmath20 line , the neutron - proton pairing has been attracting more interest than before .",
    "a number of works have been devoted to this subject to investigate the existence of @xmath7 spin - triplet superfluidity , its competition with the @xmath8 spin - singlet one , and its manifestation in observables such as binding energies of @xmath7 and @xmath8 states , and charge - exchange or pair - transfer reactions ( for reviews , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . as a generic trend ,",
    "a phenomenological analysis made on the systematics of the measured binding energies in @xmath21 nuclei shows that the @xmath7 pair condensation is not likely to exist in those nuclei @xcite . on the other hand , systematic hartree - fock - bogoliubov calculations performed in refs .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the isoscalar pair condensation might take place in much heavier @xmath22 regions .",
    "however , it is still interesting and important to study some specific systems in the proximity of the @xmath20 line , where the neutron - proton pair in @xmath7 channel could play a prominent role .    in general , a condition which is expected to maximize the chance for valence nucleons to form @xmath7 pairs",
    "is that they lie in the orbitals on top of a @xmath20 closed - shell core , and that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 orbitals with low @xmath25 are vacant in the valence space .",
    "in addition , it is favorable that the mass of nucleus is large so that the effect of the spin - orbit field at surface becomes relatively week @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we focus on @xmath1 system , whose core , @xmath26sn , is the largest @xmath20 doubly - magic nucleus located just below the proton drip line . in this system , the valence nucleons can occupy @xmath27-wave states as in @xmath28f nucleus , where the strong effect of @xmath10 coupling channel is observed as the implementation of the good su(4 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "therefore , the nucleus @xmath4sb would be the last possible system on @xmath20 line in which the @xmath7 pair coupling between the valence nucleons may play a significant role although further developments of experimental facilities are needed to perform spectroscopies of the proton - rich nucleus .    in order to describe the @xmath4sb system ,",
    "we develop the @xmath2 three - body model which is based on the self - consistent mean - field calculations . a similar model which combines the self - consistent mean - field and shell model technique has been employed in ref .",
    "@xcite for studying the deformation effects on the @xmath29 and @xmath30 pairs .",
    "we employ relativistic energy density functionals ( edfs ) as well as the non - relativistic ones because of the reason to be explained in sec . [",
    "sec : edf ] . using this model",
    ", we can calculate the low - lying levels of the @xmath31 systems and the transition rates among them .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe our model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : edf ] , we illustrate the characteristic features of the different edfs to be used in our calculations .",
    "we present the results of our three - body model calculations in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] is devoted for a summary of the paper .",
    "in this work we employ a three - body model @xcite in which one assumes a core + two nucleons structure of the system .",
    "the model was originally developed for studying di - neutron pair in neutron - rich nuclei near the dripline @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to proton - rich systems assuming @xmath32 structure @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have extended the model to @xmath33 systems to study neutron - proton pair in @xmath7 channel in @xmath20 nuclei .",
    "the three - body hamiltonian for @xmath33 system is given by @xmath34 where the first and second terms are the kinetic energies of the valence nucleons , and the third and the fourth terms are core - nucleon mean - field potentials , the fifth term is the residual interaction between the valence nucleons , and the last term is the recoil kinetic energy of the core .",
    "the core - nucleon potentials @xmath35 ( and @xmath36 ) were given in ref .",
    "@xcite as a spherical woods - saxon potential with central and spin - orbit parts ( plus the coulomb potential ) .    in the present case where we have @xmath26sn as the core",
    ", it is difficult to determine the parameters of the woods - saxon potential since the data are quite poor for this nucleus .",
    "thus we take instead a self - consistent mean - field hamiltonian for the single - particle part , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the single - particle hamiltonian obtained with a hartree - fock calculation for the core nucleus .",
    "we neglect the recoil term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3bws ] ) because the core ( @xmath39 ) is much heavier than nucleons . for the residual interaction @xmath40 ,",
    "we take a density - dependent zero - range interaction which has both spin - singlet and spin - triplet channels , @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\hat p_t fv_0\\delta({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}_p-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}_n)\\left[1+x_t\\left(\\frac{\\rho(r_p)}{\\rho_0}\\right)^{\\alpha_t}\\right ] ,   \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq : vpair}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the projectors onto spin - singlet and spin - triplet channels , respectively , @xmath44 note that , when two nucleons are in the same @xmath45 shell , the spin - singlet interaction acts only on even-@xmath46 states [ @xmath47 , while the spin - triplet interaction acts on odd-@xmath46 [ @xmath48 .",
    "the density @xmath49 in the density dependent term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vpair ] ) is given by the mean - field calculation for the core . in order to fix the @xmath50 coupling strength of the delta interaction @xmath51",
    ", we first introduce the cutoff energy @xmath52 of the model space and adjust @xmath51 so that the empirical neutron pairing gap of @xmath53sn is reproduced .",
    "the ratio @xmath54 of the strength of the spin - triplet interaction to that of the singlet one is estimated using the data of other @xmath20 odd - odd nuclei .",
    "[ sec : result ] for details how to fix the parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalized on two - particle basis of the valence nucleons , which is given by a product of proton and neutron single - particle states .",
    "the single - particle states are the eigenstates of the self - consistent mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath25 , @xmath45 , and @xmath57 are the radial quantum number , the orbital angular momentum , the total angular momentum , and its projection on @xmath58-axis , respectively .",

    "is constructed as latexmath:[\\ ] ] the probability of @xmath50 is given as @xmath130      it is assumed that the charge - exchange gamow - teller - type transition is induced by the coupling of the charge - changing axial - vector current of nucleon to the charged pion .",
