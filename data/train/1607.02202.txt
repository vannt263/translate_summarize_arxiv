    "the number of particles in a bunch is @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the average density in the bunch normalized by @xmath29 .",
    "we assume that multiple bunches compose a thin shell whose surface area is comparable to the polar cap surface . in this case , the number of bunches in a shell is @xmath271 .",
    "we also assume @xmath272 so that the number of the shell we can observe in one rotational period is @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is the observed pulse width and we use @xmath275 based on the observational results in @xcite .",
    "then , the coherent radio luminosity is estimated as @xmath276 where @xmath277 is the power of curvature radiation for single particle and @xmath13 is the radius of the field line curvature .",
    "note that the radio luminosity in equation ( [ radioluminosity ] ) does not explicitly depend on the spin - down luminosity .",
    "the observations also show that the radio luminosity is @xmath278 erg s@xmath279 , regardless of the position in the @xmath280-@xmath281 diagram @xcite .",
    "the characteristic frequency is @xmath282 the obtained values are roughly consistent with the observations .",
    "the important point is that the extraction of ions from the nss occurs for both sign of @xmath8 , if the back - flowing particles exist .",
    "most studies including the ion extraction from the nss focus on the anti - pulsar ( @xmath110 at the polar cap ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the screened state with @xmath283 .",
    "the current density of the beam component is either @xmath284 or @xmath285 . for @xmath109 and @xmath286 ,",
    "the ions are extracted from the nss . in this case",
    ", the quasi - periodic behavior in section [ ion ] is expected to occur . for @xmath110 , because of the symmetry to the point @xmath287 in the @xmath288 diagram ( figure [ diagram ] ) , ions are extracted from the nss for the case @xmath289 as discussed in section [ setup ] .",
    "therefore , the quasi - periodic behavior in section [ ion ] is possible for both sign of @xmath8 .",
    "in order to activate the oar , the electric field along the magnetic field just above the nss should be screened out . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the condition on the electric field screening just above the nss with back - flowing particles .",
    "we have focused on the case so - called anti - gj condition , which would be established along the magnetic fields that connect to the oar . without the back - flows ,",
    "the electric field can not be screened out by the particles extracted from the nss alone .",
    "first , we consider the case that particles accelerated in the oar with lorentz factor @xmath1 ( the beam component ) are flowing back to the nss [ figure [ image ] ( a ) ] .",
    "the current and charge densities of the beam component and particles from the nss contribute to the total ones .",
    "then , even in the anti - gj case , there is some screened solutions in a certain region for the combination of the current densities @xmath58 and @xmath63 ( figure [ diagram ] ) .",
    "we analytically introduce a parameter @xmath77 to characterize the required flow speed of the particles extracted from the nss .",
    "the electric field is not screened in the conditions so - called r - super - gj and r - anti - gj , which are defined by @xmath77 .",
    "however , we can expect that a quasi - thermal plasma with a mildly relativistic temperature screens out the electric field between the oar and the outer boundary of the polar cap region [ figure [ image ] ( b ) ] .",
    "some fraction of such thermal components can also flow back to the nss . using numerical simulations",
    ", we show that the thermal component can adjust both the current and charge densities to the required values .",
    "we obtain the minimum number density of the thermal component to screen the electric field in equations ( [ screen1 ] ) and ( [ screen2 ] ) .",
    "we also investigate the ion - extracted case from the nss .",
    "the difference of masses of electrons and ions causes bunches of particles , which are formed quasi - periodically .",
    "the period is linearly proportional to the length of the calculation domain",
    ". this may be important process for the coherent radio emission .",
