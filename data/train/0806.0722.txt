    "stochastic processes have been used to model a great variety of systems in disciplines as disparate as physics @xcite , genomics @xcite , finance @xcite , climatology @xcite and social sciences @xcite .",
    "one possible classification of stochastic processes takes into account the properties of their conditional probability densities . in this respect ,",
    "markov processes play a central role in the modeling of natural phenomena . in the framework of discrete time",
    "stochastic processes , a process @xmath1 is said to be a markov process if the conditional probability density @xmath8 depends only on the last value @xmath9 at @xmath10 and not on the previous values @xmath11 at @xmath12 , @xmath13 at @xmath14 , etc . more generally , the transition probability of any markov process fulfills the chapman - kolmogorov equation @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that a markov process is fully determined by the knowledge of the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath15 of the process and the transition probability @xmath16 .",
    "when the markovian process is continuous both in space and time , the time evolution of the pdf is described by a fokker - planck ( fp ) equation .",
    "such level of simplicity is rather unique among stochastic processes .",
    "in fact , a non - markovian process is characterized by an infinite hierarchy of transition probabilities . in this case , the time evolution of the pdf is described by a master equation rather than a simpler fp equation .",
    "another classification of stochastic processes considers the nature of correlation of the random variable . under this classification ,",
    "random variables are divided in short - range and long - range correlated variables .",
    "short - range correlated variables are characterized by a finite mean of time - scales of the process whereas a similar mean time - scale does not exist for long - range correlated variables @xcite .",
    "an equivalent definition can be given by considering the finiteness or infiniteness of the integral of the autocorrelation function of the random process @xcite .",
    "in the presence of long - range correlation , the time integral @xmath17 of the process @xmath1 is a superdiffusive stochastic process showing @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "superdiffusive stochastic processes have been observed in several physical systems .",
    "a classical example is richardson s observation that the relative separation @xmath21 of two particles moving in a turbulent fluid at time @xmath22 follows the relation @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "other examples include anomalous kinetic in chaotic dynamics due to flights and trapping @xcite , dynamics of aggregate of amphiphilic molecules @xcite , dynamics of a tracer in a two - dimensional rotating flow @xcite , non - coding regions of complete genomes @xcite and volatility in financial markets @xcite .",
    "several stationary markovian processes are short - range correlated . in fact , the paradigmatic markovian process is the ornstein  uhlembeck ( ou ) one @xcite , whose autocorrelation function is the exponential function @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the time - scale of the process .",
    "although in the ou process there is one single time - scale , a general markovian stationary process can be multi - scale , i.e. it may admit either a discrete or a continuum set of time - scales .",
    "in the last case , when the largest time - scale is removed to infinity the process can even be long - range correlated . the paradigmatic markovian process with power - law autocorrelation function is given by the family of processes considered in ref .",
    "these are stationary markovian power - law correlated processes that were introduced in the context of diffusion in optical lattices and semiclassically describe the motion of atoms in a one - dimensional optical lattice formed by two counterpropagating laser beams perpendicularly polarized . for a certain choice of the relevant paramenters",
    "the processes become long  range correlated .    the existence of a power - law decaying autocorrelation function in the processes of ref .",
    "@xcite is intimately related to the existence of power - law tails in the stationary pdf .",
    "this is easily understood by considering that the processes of ref .",
    "@xcite describe particles moving in a confining smoluchowski potential which asymptotically grows like @xmath26 . if one compare such slow growth with the one associated to the ou process , whose smoluchowski potential grows like @xmath27 , it is easy to recognize that in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite ( i ) a particle can reach positions far away from the center of the potential because it is subject to a relatively weaker force and ( ii ) if a particle reaches a position @xmath28 , then it is not suddenly recalled towards the center of the potential and therefore it can explore for relatively long times the regions around @xmath28 .",
    "loosely speaking , the time - series of the processes of ref .",
    "@xcite can show persistencies and clustering of extreme events .",
    "such processes perfectly fit the features of the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where long - range dependencies are shown to explain the clustering of extreme events .",
    "however , one could have in principle slowly decaying autocorrelation functions without necessarily observing the occurrence of extreme events .",
    "one such example is given by the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite which is a stochastic process where the autocorrelation function decays like a power - law and the stationary pdf is gaussian .",
    "in this paper , in the context of markovian processes , we give explicit examples of power - law correlated stationary processes where the stationary pdf shows tails which are gaussian or exponential .",
    "we will introduce such processes starting from appropriate coordinate transformations of an additive processes introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section [ meto ]",
    "we review the eigenfunction methodology used to analyze the correlation properties of a given stochastic process and introduce a specific power - law correlated process with power - law tails . in section [ gauss ] and [ exp ]",
    "we will present examples of power - law correlated stochastic processes with gaussian and exponentail tails in the stationary pdf respectively . in section [ concl ]",

    "we will consider the specific stationary markovian processes associated with a quantum potential @xmath50 given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are positive constants .",
    "the reason for considering such specific potential , among all those fullfilling the requirements of ref .",
    "@xcite , is that it is exactly solvable and therefore it will allow us to perform most calculations analytically .",
    "the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be chosen in such a way that the spectrum contains one single discrete eigenvalue @xmath55 and a continuous part for @xmath56 . as a result , the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not independent .",
    "in fact , the continuity of @xmath57 in @xmath58 provides a relation between them .",
    "the langevin equation of the process is @xmath59 the associated fp equation describes the dynamics of an overdamped particle moving in a smoluchowski potential @xmath60 that increases logarithmically in @xmath61 . for @xmath62 , the eigenfunction of the ground state is @xmath63 whereas for @xmath64 it decays according to @xmath65 .",
    "the constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 are set by imposing that @xmath68 is normalized and continuous in @xmath58 .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath64 the stationary pdf @xmath69 of the stochastic process is a power - law function decaying as @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
