    "extensive deep multi - wavelength observations across the sky have vastly improved our knowledge of star - formation and agn activity across a range of redshifts .",
    "it has become abundantly clear that the universe at @xmath6 , was much more active than it is currently , at @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the star - formation rate density steadily rises from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , flattens out until at least @xmath103 and then falling off again at the highest redshifts @xcite .",
    "agn activity shows a similar form , indicating that globally , at least , the growth of supermassive black holes roughly tracks the buildup of the stellar population in galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observing galaxies at z@xmath112 should give us tremendous insight into this evolution , and the interplay between agn and star - formation in their host galaxies during this more active phase , but spectroscopic identifications , and hence our understanding of galaxies with @xmath12 is complicated by the  redshift desert \" .",
    "at these redshifts there are very few spectral features at observed - frame optical wavelengths that can be used to determine the redshift . in response to this problem",
    "numerous selection techniques have been developed that use broad band photometry instead of spectroscopy to select @xmath102 candidate galaxies .",
    "for example , the lyman - break and balmer break features have been used to select galaxies with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the bzk selection technique of @xcite combines optical ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 band ) and near - ir ( @xmath16 band ) photometry to target the balmer and 4000    break features of star - forming and passively evolving galaxies at @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "the selection technique is expected to be largely independent of reddening @xcite and the near - ir photometry allows extremely red passively evolving galaxies to be selected , as well as bluer , star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "bzk selection shows good agreement with other @xmath102 galaxy selection techniques , although it is liable to miss the bluest / youngest star - forming galaxies ( k@xmath17 vega mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "many sbzks show strong emission in the mid - ir at 24@xmath1 m , the majority of which is attributable to dusty star formation @xcite . by comparing uv and ir derived star - formation rates ( sfr s )",
    "@xcite identified sbzks with excess ir emission ( ir excess sbzk ) as candidates for containing agn .",
    "@xcite to attempted to isolate sbzks which might contain agn using this mid - ir excess .",
    "agn are expected to exhibit strong continuum emission at mid - ir wavelengths due to re - radiated emission from hot dust ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , a feature that has been exploited previously to identify obscured agn @xcite .",
    "@xcite stacked the x - ray emission of ir excess sbzks in the goods - s field , yielding a hard x - ray signal ( @xmath18 ) consistent with a significant population of compton thick ( n@xmath19 @xmath20 ) agn .",
    "the stacked signal of x - ray undetected sbzks that did not exhibit excessive ir emission ( ir non - excess sbzks ) appeared softer ( @xmath21 ) and consistent with pure star - formation .",
    "these results have significant implications for co - eval star - formation and black hole growth and the composition of the x - ray background .",
    "the presence of  buried \" compton thick agn in star - forming galaxies ( like sbzks ) has been predicted by models of agn - galaxy - co - evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of the x - ray background @xcite has been resolved using the emission of discrete x - ray sources ( as predicted by @xcite ) , but there remains an unexplained hard ( e @xmath22 6 kev ) x - ray deficit @xcite .",
    "models of the x - ray background predict the hard x - ray background deficit could represent a large population of as yet undiscovered compton thick agn at @xmath23 @xcite . extrapolating the stacked x - ray emission of the x - ray undetected ir - excess sbzks over all",
    "the sky would explain a substantial portion ( @xmath24 ) of the hard x - ray background deficit @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out further analysis of sbzks using new , deeper 4ms cdfs x - ray data and found that stacking x - ray spectra of heavily obscured ( @xmath25 ) sbzks produced a hard , reflection dominated spectrum consistent with compton thick agn emission .",
    "the stacked spectrum features a large ew iron line at rest - frame e @xmath11 6.4 kev similar to that observed in compton thick agn in the local universe @xcite and distant universe @xcite .",
    "stacked the spectra of sbzk galaxies containing heavily obscured agn and found their spectra was best fit by a pure reflection model with a strong iron k@xmath26 line at rest - frame 6.4 kev .",
    "this is consistent with compton thick absorption ( n@xmath27@xmath28 ) in a small fraction of sbzk galaxies . stacking x - ray undetected sbzks in deeper 4ms cdfs data",
    "did not yield conclusive evidence of a high fraction of heavily obscured agn in the more general sbzk population , however , somewhat in disagreement with the earlier work of @xcite .",
    "these observations imply that the space density of compton thick agn at @xmath0 is comparable to that of unobscured agn at @xmath0 .",
    "the ir excess analysis of @xcite is reliant upon the accuracy of ir and uv sfr estimates .",
    "mid - ir observations have been found to be reliable proxies for bolometric ir luminosities @xcite and it has been common practice to fit 24@xmath1 m observations ( rest - frame 8@xmath1 m at @xmath0 ) with empirically derived star - forming galaxy templates ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) to estimate the sfr . with the advent of _",
    "herschel _ our understanding of the far - ir spectra of star - forming galaxies has improved markedly , especially at @xmath29 .",
    "using far - ir _ herschel _ data @xcite calculated @xmath5 for numerous galaxies with mips coverage and compared them to @xmath5 estimates made using 24@xmath1 m selected star - forming templates of @xcite .",
    "based on this analysis it is concluded that the star - forming templates of @xcite are overestimating the bolometric ir luminosity for galaxies with @xmath30 @xmath31 . additionally @xcite find that the ir excess emission at rest - frame 8@xmath1 m can be explained entirely by pah features , removing the necessity for mid - ir continuum emission from agn assumed by previous ir selection techniques .",
    "the uv estimates of sfr are known to suffer in dusty ( ie heavily star - forming ) galaxies because reddening corrections become less accurate as the dust opacity increases @xcite .",
    "thus , selection of agn via comparison of ir and uv - derived sfrs may not be as robust as previously thought .",
    "indeed , recent work have suggested that some ir excess selection techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) have been shown to select equal parts heavily obscured agn , low - luminosity agn and purely star - forming galaxies @xcite when followed up using x - ray data .    in the light of this ,",
    "in the present paper we revisit the issue of the agn content in ir excess bzk galaxies pioneered by @xcite .",
    "we examine the x - ray properties of ir luminous sbzks , selected in a similar manner to @xcite , using 4ms cdfs and 2ms cdfn x - ray data , through a mixture of direct detections and stacking . in section [ sub : optir ]",
    "we discuss the optical and ir data used in this work .",
    "section [ sub : sample ] outlines the bzk and 24@xmath1 m selection methodology while sections [ sub : xray_redux ] and [ sub : stacking ] outline the x - ray data reduction and x - ray stacking technique respectively . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results of direct x - ray detection of sbzks and stacking of x - ray undetected sbzks and in section [ sec : comparison ] we compare our findings to those of @xcite and @xcite . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the implications of these results and in section [ sec : summary ] we summarise our findings . throughout this work a standard , flat @xmath32cdm cosmology with @xmath33 and h@xmath34  km  s@xmath35  mpc@xmath35 is assumed .",
    "in the cdfs we use _ hubble _ acs f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp band ( henceforth @xmath36 and @xmath15 respectively ) , isaac @xmath16 band , irac 3.6@xmath1 m and mips 24@xmath1 m band data from the goods - music - v2 catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "all objects have either a spectroscopic ( 64% ) or a photometric ( 36% ) redshift .",
    "this dataset presents identical @xmath37 and 3.6@xmath1 m photometry to the goods - music catalogue ( @xcite ) that was used by @xcite but incorporates deeper mips 24@xmath1 m band data from the fidel survey ( pi : mark dickinson ) .",
    "the 24@xmath1 m source fluxes in goods - music - v2 were identified and matched to the multi - wavelength data using the convphot software @xcite , as opposed to matching the mips sources to multi - wavelength data using a more basic fixed matching radius method ( as was the case for @xcite and subsequently daddi et al 2007a and 2007b ) .",
    "the additional depth and use of the convphot software allows the identification of additional 24@xmath1 m sources and therefore increases our sample size compared to @xcite .",
    "the goods - music - v2 catalogue has more spectroscopic redshifts than goods - music , improving the accuracy of our luminosity calculations . in the cdfn",
    "we use _ hubble _ acs @xmath38 and @xmath15 band , moircs @xmath39 , irac 3.6@xmath1 m and mips 24@xmath1 m band photometry collected for the moircs deep survey ( mods ; @xcite ) .",
    "mods is the only publicly available catalogue in cdfn to date to have matched k band to 24@xmath1 m sources .",
    "again , sources have a mixture of spectroscopic ( 70% ) and photometric ( 30% ) redshifts .      1 .   a secure k - band detection ( @xmath40 vega ) .",
    "2 .   less than 0.5 arcseconds separation from an irac 3.6um selected source to verify that the source is genuine ( large psfs of 24@xmath1 m sources leads to source blending ) .",
    "3 .   error on @xmath41 to ensure reddening corrections are reliable .",
    "4 .   either a spectroscopic or photometric redshift ."

    "<S> this is particularly the case when one accounts for the strong correlation between the ir excess parameter and the bolometric ir luminosity ( @xmath5 ) , e.g. when controlling for @xmath5 , the ir non - excess sbzks show a detection rate at least as high . </S>",
    "<S> while both direct detections and stacking suggest that the agn fraction in sbzk galaxies is high , there is no clear evidence for widespread compton thick activity in either the sbzk population generally , or the ir excess sbzk subsample . </S>",
    "<S> the very hard x - ray signal obtained for the latter in earlier work was most likely contaminated by a few hard x - ray sources now directly detected in deeper x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray detection fraction of passive bzk galaxies in our sample is if anything higher than that of sbzks , so there is no evidence for coeval black hole growth and star formation from x - ray analysis of the bzk populations . because increased agn activity in the ir excess population is not indicated by our x - ray analysis , it appears that the bulk of the ir excess sbzk population are luminous star - forming galaxies whose sfrs are either overestimated at 24@xmath1 m , underestimated in the uv , or both . </S>",
