    "a century after the discovery of the blazhko effect in rr  lyrae stars @xcite , it can still not be explained theoretically in a satisfactory way @xcite .",
    "the blazhko effect manifests itself in the frequency spectrum of the light variations as one or more side frequencies close to the main pulsation frequency .",
    "the beat period resulting from the interaction between the main frequency and the side frequency is called the blazhko period .",
    "the question focuses on how many side frequencies there are .",
    "resonance models involving non - radial pulsations with degree @xmath5 lead to an equidistant triplet structure that is most commonly observed : two additional frequencies , one on each side of the main frequency and at the same distance . in some cases only doublets",
    "are observed , presumably because the amplitude of the third frequency is too low to be detected .",
    "oblique magnetic models with @xmath6 lead to an equidistant quintuplet structure .",
    "recently a frequency quintuplet was found for the first time in rv  uma @xcite . although admittedly very rare , some rr  lyrae stars show two blazhko periods .",
    "these stars pose a particular challenge for the theories .",
    "ls  her is one of the stars known to have two blazhko periods .",
    "it was discovered to be variable by @xcite and first classified as a w  uma type eclipsing binary .",
    "observations on six consecutive nights by @xcite revealed its nature as an rr  lyrae star pulsating in the first overtone mode ( an rrc type object ) . with a period of 0.2316 days",
    "@xcite it has one of the shortest periods among the rrc stars .",
    "binnendijk also noted variations in the light curve from night to night , but did not find a beat period because of the short timespan of his observations .",
    "from the public survey data of the northern sky variability survey ( nsvs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite found ls  her to be a blazhko star with a blazhko period of 13 days .",
    "@xcite found two pairs of blazhko triplets resulting in periods of 11.5 and 12.8 days from data of the all sky automated survey ( asas-3 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "other galactic examples with multiple blazhko periods are xz  cyg with periods of 57.5 and 41.6 days @xcite , uz  uma with periods of 26.7 and 143 days @xcite and su  col with periods of 65.8 and 89.3 days @xcite . unlike ls  her ,",
    "all these stars are fundamental mode pulsators ( rrab stars ) . until recently , only a few galactic field",
    "blazhko rrc stars were known @xcite . because of its short period it is possible to observe a full pulsation cycle of ls  her during a night . combined with its double short blazhko cycles , this made ls  her a very interesting object for detailed study .    the spectral type of ls  her has been given as a2 @xcite , a5 @xcite and f0 @xcite .",
    "ls  her was observed on 63 nights during six months in 2007 from two private observatories . on three nights",
    "the star was observed at both observatories .",
    "more than 240 hours of ccd photometry were secured in @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and 65 hours on 22 nights in @xmath1 .",
    "the complete observation log , together with information on the instruments used , is given in table  [ log ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,<,^,^,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fourier ] shows several frequency spectra created from the @xmath0 data .",
    "besides the spectral window it shows the frequency spectrum after removal of the first , second and third triplet side frequencies .",
    "it can be seen that after removing all frequencies given in table  [ freq ] , there seems to be some power left at frequencies near integer fractions of a day .",
    "the amplitude is however small , less than 6 mmag .",
    "this remaining power is possibly caused by small zero point shifts in the data from night to night , likely introduced by the corrections needed to account for the use of different comparison stars .",
    "phase diagrams after consecutive cleaning of our @xmath0 data with the three frequency triplets are given in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "data for ls  her .",
    "the top panel shows the spectral window .",
    "panels a , b and c show the spectrum after consecutively prewhitening for the first , second and third triplet respectively.,width=302 ]     data for ls  her plotted with the main pulsation period of 0.230808 days . from top to bottom the data are plotted without prewhitening and then with consecutively prewhitening for the first , second and third triplet . in order not to overload the diagrams ,",
    "only one out of three data points have been plotted.,width=283 ]    the second and third triplets may be viewed as changing the ( primary ) blazhko modulation itself . with a period of @xmath4 days the amount of variation in amplitude and phase will change . in the frequency spectrum",
    "this manifests itself by the side frequencies of the first blazhko triplet being equidistant triplets themselves . in table",
    "[ freq ] we have therefore dubbed @xmath7 as the frequency of this superposed modulation .    to illustrate the modulation of the blazhko period , an analysis was done of small subsets of the @xmath0 data set .",
    "each subset was taken to be 25 days in length ( about two blazhko cycles ) , and the best fitting amplitudes and phases were determined for the pulsation frequency @xmath8 , the main blazhko frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and their linear combinations . precise determination of the frequencies themselves is rather sensitive to the distribution of the data in such a small set . therefore the frequencies were kept fixed at the values determined from the total dataset . a change in their value",
    "would then be manifested as a change in their phase .",
    "the results of this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "[ change ] .",
    "the top panel shows the change in amplitude of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as a function of the phase in the 109-day cycle .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ change ] shows the change in phase .",
    "as there is no change in phase of the main pulsation period , it remains effectively constant during the long cycle .",
    "however , the blazhko period appears to vary cyclically in that interval , as can be seen from the phase changes of the blazhko frequencies .",
    "the variation in the blazhko modulation may perhaps be compared to the four year cycle in the blazhko period of rr  lyr @xcite . however ,",
    "possible splitting of the side frequencies similar to what is observed in ls  her , has not yet been detected in rr  lyr , perhaps because of this long period and the very long data sets needed .",
    "a phase shift of the blazhko maximum as seen at the end of a 4-year cycle in rr  lyr was not observed in ls  her .    as can be seen in table  [ freq ] , the second order triplet frequencies ( around the first harmonic of the main pulsation frequency )",
    "are found for the first ( @xmath11 ) and second ( @xmath12 ) triplet , but not for the third ( @xmath13 ) , presumably because their amplitude is too low .",
    "there is no indication of the quintuplet frequencies @xmath14 , however , the frequency @xmath15 has a significant amplitude in the data .",
    "( crosses ) and the blazhko frequencies @xmath9 ( filled circles ) and @xmath10 ( open circles).,width=302 ]",
    "ls  her was found to be an rrc blazhko star with three close blazhko triplets around the main pulsation frequency .",
    "the side frequencies of each of the three triplets are at the same distance from the main first overtone pulsation frequency .",
    "in addition , the side frequencies of the second and third triplets are at the same distance from the side frequencies of the first triplet , within uncertainties .",
    "consequently the maximum amplitude and maximum phase shift of the blazhko effect changes .",
    "the blazhko effect was found to have a primary period of 12.75 days , while its influence on amplitude and phase shifts , due to the additional triplets , changes in a cycle of 109 days .",
    "the frequency spectrum of ls  her has been found to be unique so far , but it is not excluded that other stars which are known to have two blazhko periods also show this complex frequency structure . as their blazhko periods are much longer , the missing triplet would also be much harder to detect .",
    "adequate coverage of a number of consecutive blazhko cycles would be required to reveal additional frequencies in the spectrum of a blazhko star .",
    "the complex frequency spectrum of ls  her can not easily be inferred from the current theories of the blazhko effect .",
    "ls  her is therefore an important star against which to verify any theory of the blazhko effect .",
