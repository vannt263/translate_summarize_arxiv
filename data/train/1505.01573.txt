    "the relative magnitude of the two parity components determines the relative size of the two gaps and the main property of a ncs .",

    "as one of the main experimental methods in the field of superconductivity , the josephson effect has been widely studied in junctions based on ncss to investigate the characteristic triplet - singlet ratios .",

    "it is interesting that these two pairs have the same phase shift @xmath121 induced by the f layer @xcite , and correspond to the same gap @xmath125 at the same time .",

    "the set of abs with index @xmath32 experience a phase shift @xmath121 from the original degenerate abs . with increasing singlet percentage @xmath52 , the energy span of the set of abs with helicity index @xmath113 shrinks due to the decreasing minor gap @xmath147 .",
    "that means the corresponding supercurrent with @xmath113 has a smaller amplitude .",
    "the special case of @xmath148 is noticeable because the minor gap closes completely .",

    "the evolution of abs with varying @xmath146 and @xmath52 shown in fig .",
    "[ abs ] is fully consistent with the above analytical results .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the abs is almost the same for @xmath150 and @xmath151 as discussed in the analytical results .",
    "because of the presence of weak normal reflections at ncs / f interfaces in the numerical results , there opens a small gap at some abs crossing points due to the coupling of two abs bands with the same spin and the opposite travelling direction ( thus with the opposite helicity index @xmath152 ) .",
    "what is interesting is that the anti - crossing effect for the case of @xmath153 is much weaker than that for @xmath154 .",
    "we can understand this effect easily in two limit cases @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "for the coupled two bands with the opposite @xmath155 and the opposite @xmath152 , eq . ( [ h22 ] ) shows that @xmath91 changes sign while @xmath90 does not . that is the essential difference between the singlet and triplet pairing .",
    "thus , the normal reflection induced coupling results in an anti - crossing gap opening for the triplet - dominant case but no obvious effect for the singlet - dominant case at abs crossing points .",
    "the anti - crossing effect gives rise to high - order harmonics of the cpr , which is sensitive to the triplet - singlet ratio as reported in ref . .",

    "the singlet pairing is always opposite - spin pairing ( independent of the direction of the spin quantization axis ) while the triplet pairing is equal - spin pairing in the spin quantization axes perpendicular to the helicity basis .",

    "but the phase shift is now the same for two abs because the @xmath21-axis makes an angle of @xmath185 with the spin - down direction of right - going abs while @xmath182 with that of left - going abs .     and various @xmath23 : ( a ) @xmath8 , ( b ) @xmath186 , ( c ) @xmath187 , ( d ) @xmath188 .",
    "in each panel , the results for varying values of @xmath189 from @xmath8 to @xmath190 are plotted .",
    "other parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ sp].,width=327 ]    when @xmath191 and @xmath185 , the situation is particularly interesting .",
    "now the magnetization direction is parallel ( or antiparallel ) to the spin - down direction of one abs but perpendicular to that of the other abs .",
    "so one abs experiences only a phase shift while the other not only experiences a phase shift but also shrinks a little .",
    "it is interesting that the shrinking abs disappears totally at @xmath192 , which means that the spin - down particles are flipped totally to spin - up and propagate into ncss as a continuous propagating state .",
    "for example , when @xmath193 and @xmath192 , the supercurrent is totally carried by continuous propagating states instead of discrete abs for the phase difference range @xmath194 .",
    "it is shown that the abs of @xmath191 and that of @xmath195 are symmetric to each other with respect to the @xmath196 axis for the reason of symmetry .",
    "similarly , the abs for @xmath197 is symmetric to that for @xmath198 with respect to the @xmath196 axis .     and various @xmath189 : ( a ) @xmath186 , ( b ) @xmath187 , ( c ) @xmath188 , ( d ) @xmath190 .",
    "in each panel , @xmath52 varies from @xmath8 to @xmath158 with a step of @xmath199 .",
    "other parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ sp].,width=327 ]    the corresponding total josephson currents are shown in fig .",
    "when @xmath200 , the cpr exhibits a @xmath8-@xmath10 transition with increasing @xmath201 .",
    "the anomalous josephson effect does not occur because the two abs have opposite phase shifts as discussed above .",
    "when @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 , the anomalous josephson current appears .",
    "the cpr is the same for @xmath202 and @xmath204 as the symmetry between their abs shows . and",
    "the cpr for @xmath203 is only a bit different from that for @xmath202 . as a whole ,",
    "the ground - state phase difference is continuously tunable by adjusting @xmath201 . when @xmath202 and @xmath205 , the contribution from @xmath179 to the supercurrent ( not shown here ) show that the propagating state carried supercurrent ( @xmath206 , see fig .",
    "[ absdp ] ) equals to that carried by the abs ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "now we discuss the general case of arbitrary @xmath52 where the two gaps are both open .",
    "we choose @xmath207 to let the exchange field align with the spin polarization axis of left - going ( right - going ) abs of @xmath208 ( @xmath209 ) component .",
    "the cprs for various @xmath52 and @xmath146 are shown in fig .",
    "the case of @xmath210 is similar to fig .",
    "[ sp ] ( a ) and thus not shown here . for @xmath173 and @xmath163 , the situation is similar to that in the case of s+p wave .",
    "especially , the case of @xmath163 is still important to determine the triplet - singlet ratio of ncs because the ground - state phase difference @xmath11 varies monotonically with increasing @xmath52 while the critical current changes little .",
    "what is different from the case of s+p wave is that @xmath11 is not zero even at @xmath88 or @xmath158 . that is due to the spin - splitting of the momentum factor of gap function @xmath92 . for @xmath211 and @xmath212 , the evolution of critical current is similar to that in the @xmath0+@xmath1 wave case .",
    "but the evolution of @xmath11 is very different from that for @xmath0+@xmath1 wave . here",
    "@xmath11 changes monotonically with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "as discussed previously , that is because the exchange field is perpendicular to the spin direction of right - going ( left - going ) abs of @xmath208 ( @xmath209 ) component .",
    "these abs with perpendicular spin direction makes difference between singlet and triplet pairing .",
    "thus @xmath11 as well as the critical current are different for singlet - dominant and triplet - dominant pairing .      for the @xmath2+@xmath213 wave case , the momentum dependence of the gap function @xmath214 .",
    "the gap is maximum at @xmath215 or @xmath168 .",
    "however , the contributions from @xmath216 to the supercurrent are small in comparison with that from @xmath109 .",
    "the contribution from normal incidence @xmath145 is still dominant as in the case of s+p wave .",
    "therefore the situation for d+f wave is similar to that for s+p wave and then the numerical results for d+f wave are not presented here .",
    "in summary , we predicted the appearance of anomalous josephson effect with nonzero ground - state phase difference in a ncs / f / ncs junction .",
    "the ground - state phase difference @xmath11 is proposed to serve as a tool to determine the triplet - singlet ratio of ncs .",
    "the physics picture and analytical results are given on the basis of @xmath0+@xmath1 wave , while the numerical results and discussion are given on both @xmath0+@xmath1 and @xmath2+@xmath1 waves .",
    "for @xmath0+@xmath1 wave , @xmath11 reaches the extremum when the singlet and triplet components have equal magnitude and there is no difference between singlet - dominant case and triplet - dominant case generally .",
    "but in the special case of @xmath217 , @xmath11 changes monotonically with increasing singlet percentage @xmath52 . for d+p wave",
    ", the monotonic change of @xmath11 with increasing @xmath52 is much more general if only @xmath201 is not too small .",
    "interestingly , in the case of d+p wave , we also find novel states in which the supercurrents are totally carried by continuous propagating states instead of discrete abs . instead of carrying supercurrent ,",
    "the abs which here only appear above the fermi energy block the supercurrent flowing along the opposite direction .",
