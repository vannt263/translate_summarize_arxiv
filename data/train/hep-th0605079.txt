    "<S> we correct some errors in the two papers published with the above title in class . </S>",
    "<S> quant . </S>",
    "<S> grav . </S>",
    "<S> * 19 * ( 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the correct prescription for computing the probabilities is given , in that appropriate normalization factors are introduced . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting computation of the semi - classical limit of probabilities actually becomes much simpler , and no cft analysis is necessary . in spite of some mistakes , the conclusions of these two papers are to a large extent unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we still get an exponentially small answer @xmath0 for the black hole creation - evaporation probability .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first emphasise that the prescription given in the two papers @xcite should be viewed as more of an outline of a theory of @xmath1 quantum 3d gravity than an actual proposal for such a theory . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments of @xcite do lead to quantitative predictions only in the semi - classical limit of the large radius of curvature , when it does not matter which exactly cft is used .    in these note </S>",
    "<S> we correct the prescription given in @xcite , and correct the answer for the black hole out of two point particles creation probability . </S>",
    "<S> the result is still exponentially small @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are the inverse temperature and mass of the black hole being created . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of this result is basically unchanged from the one given in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there many gaps in the arguments of @xcite , some of which have been filled after the papers were written , some are still to be settled . </S>",
    "<S> the main open issue is still to find the cft which is relevant for @xmath1 quantum gravity and which is referred to in these papers as a relative of liouville theory . </S>",
    "<S> once this cft is found , the prescription for computing amplitudes formulated in these two papers can be used for computing probabilities of physically interesting processes . </S>",
    "<S> today , four years after the papers have been written , the outlined programme for the construction of the theory of @xmath1 quantum gravity is closer to its completion . </S>",
    "<S> important advances have been made in understanding the chern - simons theory of the lorentz group , see @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> some important progress has also been achieved in understanding the classical theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the analytic continuation procedure on which the papers @xcite are based was made much more precise in the works of benedetti and bonsante , see @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the work @xcite in particular analysed the phase space of @xmath1 gravity , and it was shown that the reduced phase space is the cotangent bundle over the teichmuller space of the spatial slice . </S>",
    "<S> the same work also proposed yet another well defined analytic continuation procedure between the lorentzian and euclidean signature negative curvature 3-manifolds .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to corrections for the first paper .    * in several places in the paper ( e.g. page 3982 , the paragraph before last on this page , page 3985 , last paragraph of section 3 ) it is incorrectly stated that manifolds containing lines of conical singularities ( point particles ) can be obtained by considering discrete groups , subgroups of @xmath4 , containing elliptic elements . </S>",
    "<S> this is in general not true . </S>",
    "<S> a group generated , in particular , by elliptic generators , in general fails to be discrete , and the quotient @xmath5 is not a manifold . </S>",
    "<S> this happens already in the case of a single elliptic generator , unless the deficit angle is rational . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in general , manifolds containing point particles are not quotients of @xmath6 and have to be described and treated differently . </S>",
    "<S> a good construction for such manifolds is to consider a hyperbolic manifold , such as e.g. @xmath6 , with a two geodesic half - planes identified , so that a wedge is cut out . </S>",
    "<S> the axis of the transformation that maps one half - plane into the other becomes particle s worldline . </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , the spaces considered in this paper do exist , they are just not given by quotients anymore . </S>",
    "<S> all other arguments of the paper go through unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the description of spaces with particles is more involved than that of non - singular spaces , and is subject of current interest of the mathematical community . </S>",
    "<S> we refer the reader e.g. to @xcite , where an extensive treatment of all such issues is given . * </S>",
    "<S> the argument given on page 3986 explaining why it is natural for the quantum states to be functionals on the teichmuller space is essentially correct , in that it uses the fact that the reduced phase space of @xmath1 gravity is the cotangent bundle over the teichmuller space . </S>",
    "<S> this last fact , however , can be shown much more directly , see @xcite for the proof . * </S>",
    "<S> the prescription for extracting probabilities that is given in the paper needs to be modified , as the numbers one gets using the prescription of the paper are not normalised . </S>",
    "<S> the modification is straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the case of emission of a particle by the btz black hole . </S>",
    "<S> the state ( amplitude ) for a black hole with a particle emitted is correctly given by ( 5.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , to extract the probability , is not enough to simply square the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the correct procedure is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce a state @xmath7 describing the btz black hole with no extra point particle . </S>",
    "<S> this state is given by the cft partition function on the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> this is a state in the tensor product of two hilbert spaces , one hilbert space @xmath8 for each asymptotic region . </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space in question is just that of the cft . </S>",
    "<S> namely , it is the direct sum @xmath9 of verma modules @xmath10 , where @xmath11 runs over the set of conformal dimensions of primary fields of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the amplitude ( state ) of the btz black hole , as well as the state of the black hole with a point particle emitted , is in @xmath12 . to find the probability of emission we need to find an overlap of these two states . </S>",
    "<S> it is easiest to do this by introducing density matrices that refer only to one of the asymptotic regions , and then applying the usual rules of quantum mechanics to these density matrices . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the black hole , we introduce the density matrix @xmath13 by taking the product of @xmath7 with @xmath14 and summing over the degrees of freedom of one of the asymptotic regions . as we have sketched in the paper , such a sum is really a sum over the boundary conditions at that asymptotic region , and its effect is to glue two riemann surfaces together , to produce a `` longer '' cylinder . both ends of this cylinder now correspond to the same asymptotic region : @xmath15 \\,\\ ,   z_{\\rm cft}\\left[\\,\\ , \\lower0.15in\\hbox{\\epsfig{figure = cylinder - ba.eps , height=0.3 in } } \\,\\,\\right]= z_{\\rm cft}\\left[\\,\\ , \\lower0.15in\\hbox{\\epsfig{figure = cylinder - aa.eps , height=0.3 in } } \\,\\,\\right]\\ ] ] one applies a similar procedure to the state of the black hole with point particle , to obtain the density matrix as the cft partition function on the `` long '' cylinder with two vertex operators inserted : @xmath16\\ ] ] the probability of the emission process is now given by the overlap of these two density matrices , divided by the traces of each of these matrices : @xmath17 this is related to the quantity ( 5.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the later is , however , not correctly normalised to be interpreted as the probability . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments given later in section 5.1 still apply and show that ( [ emission - prob ] ) is qualitatively correct . * </S>",
    "<S> the prescription given in section 5.2 should also be modified . </S>",
    "<S> the expression 5.11 for the state of ads with two point particles in it is correct . </S>",
    "<S> however , to extract the black hole creation probability one should follow a procedure similar to the one above . </S>",
    "<S> we again introduce the density matrix of the black hole given by ( [ density - bh ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can similarly create the density matrix describing the pure state ( 5.11 ) : @xmath18\\ ] ] the probability of black hole creation is given by the overlap of the density matrices of the black hole and that of the pair of point particles , properly normalised : @xmath19 the quantity in the numerator is the 4-point function ( 5.12 ) projected on a particular intermediate state ( determined by the black hole size ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities in the denominator are the cft partition function on the torus , and the partition function on the 4-punctured sphere correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments of the second paper can still be applied to this expression , and conclusions will be analysed below </S>",
    "<S> .    here are the corrections for the second paper .    * the prescription for computing the black hole creation probability given in the introduction should be replaced by the prescription ( [ creation - prob ] ) above . </S>",
    "<S> the prescription ( 1.3 ) is similar , but incorrectly normalised . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the derivation of the answer ( 1.4 ) should be modified . </S>",
    "<S> the correct semi - classical regime answer can be obtained very easily as follows . in the semi - classical limit </S>",
    "<S> the 4-point function is peaked on a particular intermediate state - the one that corresponds to the black hole that would be created in the process . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the expression for the probability of creating this black hole the numerator of ( [ creation - prob ] ) , which is the 4-point function projected on a particular intermediate state , is approximately equal to the second term in the denominator , which is the full 4-point function . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the semi - classical regime , the creation probability is given by inverse of the black hole partition function : @xmath20 here @xmath21 are the bh partition function , free energy and entropy correspondingly , and @xmath3 are the inverse temperature and mass of the bh being created . </S>",
    "<S> this last expression coincides with the one given by ( 1.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that it is incorrectly stated in the text that the probability is given by @xmath22 . the correct answer is given by ( [ prob ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the arguments of the remainder of the introduction go through almost unchanged . * </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the rest of the paper is essentially correct , but as is clear from the previous argument , is not necessary in the semi - classical regime . </S>",
    "<S> the contents of the sections 2 - 3 are interesting in its own right , as they deal with the classical theory . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the contents of sections 5 - 6 are still of interest , as they demonstrate the problems that will have to be overcome for a full quantum computation of the probability to be performed . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of this sections is also necessary to confirm that the probability is peaked on the black hole that would be created in the corresponding classical process . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the probability in section 7 needs to be modified in that the normalising factors ( [ creation - prob ] ) should be introduced . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , the answer ( 7.7 ) needs to be modified , with the correct answer given above by ( [ prob ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us also note that there is a sign mistake in section 7 getting ( 7.7 ) as the value of the 4-point function . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithm of such a 4-point function for the case of maximally massive particles is equal ( in the semi - classical regime ) to half of the logarithm of the black hole partition function . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the semi - classical limit of the 4-point function for such particles is given by an exponential with a _ positive _ large argument . </S>",
    "<S> this answer makes it obvious that normalization factors such as ones in ( [ creation - prob ] ) are necessary to obtain the probability . * the argument in the discussion section , page 4023 , paragraph before last on this page , has to be modified in view of the fact that the correct answer is given by ( [ prob ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the exponentially small probability is not surprising in view of the fact that the probability we got can also be interpreted as the probability of a bh of mass @xmath23 blowing up into two particles . </S>",
    "<S> the probability @xmath2 we got is that of a thermal emission of all of @xmath24 mass @xmath23 at temperature @xmath25 , which seems a natural answer . </S>"
