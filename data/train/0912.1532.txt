    "graphene has been used as an analog case to study relativistic phenomena in heavy atoms because the critical charge for the dirac fermions in graphene is of the order of unity @xcite . upon introduction of a single charge impurity into an otherwise perfect lattice , a bound state appears within the mass gap that separates the original dirac cones electronicstruct , zhou07 .",
    "as one tunes the coupling strength of this charge impurity to larger values , eventually a critical charge condition is achieved whereby the energy of the bound states passes into the continuum . in gapped graphene , this crossover has implications for the screening properties of the electron gas.@xcite the wave function of such a bound state decays exponentially with the distance from the charge . as the coupling strength becomes supercritical , the screening effect is sufficiently strong that the observed effective charge is reduced by almost 4 elementary units compared with the unscreened case.@xcite this phenomenon is similar to what happens in atomic physics when the elementary charge is around @xmath0.@xcite the shape of the cloud of screening charge closely follows the shape of the so called  critical state \" just before it merges with the continuum of the valence band . a couple of questions arise : i ) is there a change in the electronic structure that depends on the range of potential ?",
    "ii ) what are the properties that define whether the impurity potential strength is critical or not ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we obtain the predictions of the long - wavelength dirac formalism in the case of one or few short - range impurities . in the third section , after we briefly review the green functions on the lattice pertinent to the honeycomb lattice , we obtain analytical results for one and two impurities on the graphene lattice . in the fourth section",
    ", we generalize our results for multiple short - ranged impurities , and then we close with the conclusion .",

    "the green functions @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 correspond to @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively . the t - matrix for this case is @xmath126therefore , the green function becomes @xmath127    in fact , for the many - impurity case , the t - matrix method can be used in a recursive way , @xmath128 where@xmath129    to compute the local density of states at site @xmath116 , we need @xmath130 ( for simplicity we suppress the @xmath131 ) : @xmath132 + v_{2}|g_{01}^{0}(\\omega ) |^{2}}{\\left [ 1-v_{2}g_{11}^{0}(\\omega ) \\right ] % \\left [ 1-vg_{00}^{0}(\\omega ) \\right ] -vv_{2}|g_{01}^{0}(\\omega ) |^{2 } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{f(\\omega ) } { ( \\omega -\\omega _ { 0})+i\\delta } ,   \\label{3.6}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath133 is the energy of the pole , and @xmath134 accounts for the remaining ( non - singular ) frequency dependence .",

    "the conclusion is the same : as the strength of the impurity interaction increases , the pole moves towards the top of the bottom band , but never crosses it . instead , the residue associated with the pole decreases to zero .",
    "the key difference with the coulomb case is that these are short range impurities , and this leads to qualitatively different behaviour .      in this subsection",
    "we generalize to some extent the results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "we find the long - range asymptotic behavior of the green function in the case of multiple impurities located inside a finite area of the graphene sheet . as a particular case",
    "this discussion includes the circular well , discussed in the dirac approximation , at the beginning of the article in section ii . knowing these green functions asymptotes we show that the spectral weight of the state near the band edge ( on the verge of entering into the lower continuum ) is zero and the screening charge is not significantly reshaped by this state.@xcite    we rewrite eq .",

    "the second term in eq . ( [ 4.1 ] ) represents the change induced by the impurity and is responsible for the spectral weight of the bound state .",
    "assuming @xmath150 , the following conclusions can be made about the second term .",
    "@xmath76 does not depend on @xmath147 , but @xmath151 depends on @xmath147 , and @xmath152 , as the determinant @xmath151 contains only one row with @xmath153 .    considering the sum over @xmath154 in @xmath155",
    "we see that the @xmath148 dependency comes only from the phase @xmath156 in the exponent of the integrands ( [ g_int1 ] , [ g_int2 ] ) . at the energies near the band edge @xmath157 ,",
    "the part @xmath158 can be neglected , as the small @xmath80 s produce most of the integral value and @xmath159 does not vary significantly near the dirac point . therefore ,",
    "@xmath160 the spatial dependance of the second term in @xmath161 is determined by the @xmath162 , where @xmath163 denotes some ( arbitrary chosen ) site in the impurity - occupied area . to determine the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath164",
    ", we use the method of stationary phase ( see problem 5.2 in @xcite ) , and get @xmath165where @xmath166 . thus @xmath167 , in qualitative agreement with the asymptotic behavior predicted by the dirac equation ( [ solo_asymp ] ) . as we can see from the standard definition of the green function @xcite :    @xmath168    when @xmath169 the @xmath148-dependency of @xmath170 coincides with @xmath171 and we can judge if the state that is potentially crossing the band edge into the continuum is normalizable . in our case as @xmath172 the sum of @xmath161 over @xmath173 in the plane diverges , and so does the sum @xmath174 in the infinite lattice for any finite normalizing factor .",
    "hence the state merging into the continuum can be called non - normalizable or extended and as such has zero spectral weight ( in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "this confirms our conclusion that there is no such phenomenon like supercritical screening in the case of a localized potential ( as opposed to a coulomb potential ) in graphene .",
    "our results are in agrement with common intuition developed in the physics of shallow states in semiconductors .",
    "in particular it is not only a feature peculiar to gapped graphene that properties of the states near the band edge are strongly dependent on the long range  tail \" of the impurity potential.@xcite in general , the effective mass approach ( mostly determined by long - range properties of a system ) is in good agreement with exact numerical methods for the energies near the band edge .",
    "it is exactly near the band edge where the coulomb tail becomes important while it is negligible in computations related to deep levels.@xcite as illustrated in section ii , in the continuum limit a potential barrier emerges in the effective potential at large distances , due to the squaring of the coulomb potential . because of the two sublattices , a similar ` squaring ' occurs when the problem is solved on a lattice , and lattice green functions are utilized.@xcite"
