    "barrier options introduced by merton ( 1973 ) are used widely in trading now .",
    "the option is extinguished ( knocked - out ) or activated ( knocked - in ) when an underlying asset reaches a specified level ( barrier ) .",
    "a lot of related more complex instruments for example bivariate barrier , ladder , step - up or step - down barrier options have become very popular in over - the - counter markets . in general , these options can be considered as options with payoff depending upon the path extrema of the underlying assets . a variety of closed form solutions for such instruments on a single underlying asset have been obtained in the classical black - scholes settings of constant volatility , interest rate and barrier level . see for example heynen and kat ( 1994a ) , kunitomo and ikeda ( 1992 ) , rubinstein and reiner ( 1991 ) .",
    "if the barrier option is based on two assets then a practical analytical solution can be obtained for some special cases considered in heynen and kat ( 1994b ) and he , keirstead and rebholz ( 1998 ) .    in practice , however , numerical methods are used to price the barrier options for a number of reasons , for example , if the assumptions of constant volatility and drift are relaxed or payoff is too complicated .",
    "numerical schemes such as binomial and trinomial lattices ( hull and white ( 1993 ) , kat and verdonk ( 1995 ) ) or finite difference schemes ( dewynne and wilmott ( 1993 ) ) can be applied to the problem .",
    "however , the implementation of these methods can be difficult .",
    "also , if more than two underlying assets are involved in the pricing equation then these methods are not practical .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a monte carlo simulation method which is a good general pricing tool for such instruments .",
    "however , finding the extrema of the continuously monitored assets by sampling assets at discrete dates , the standard discrete - time monte carlo approach , is computationally expensive as a large number of sampling dates and simulations are required .",
    "loss of information about all parts of the continuous - time path between sampling dates introduces a substantial bias for the option price .",
    "the bias decreases very slowly as @xmath0 for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of equally spaced sampling dates ( see broadie , glasserman and kou ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "also , extrapolation of the monte carlo estimates to the continuous limit is usually difficult due to finite sampling errors . for the case of a single underlying asset",
    ", it was shown by andersen and brotherton - ratcliffe ( 1996 ) and beaglehole , dybvig and zhou ( 1997 ) that the bias can be eliminated by a simple conditioning technique , the so - called brownian bridge simulation .",
    "the method is based on the simulation of a one - dimensional brownian bridge extremum between the sampled dates according to a simple analytical formula for the distribution of the extremum .",
    "the technique is very efficient because only one time step is required to simulate the asset path and its extremum if the barrier , drift and volatility are constant over the time region .",
    "we extend the technique to the valuation of multi - asset options with continuously monitored knock - out barriers imposed for some or all underlying assets .",
    "we derive the general formula for the unbiased estimator based on the joint distribution of the multi - dimensional brownian bridge dependent extrema . in general , however , the analytic formulas are not available for this joint distribution and we develop three biased estimators .",
    "the upper and lower estimators are based on the frchet bounds for the unknown multi - variate joint distribution of the extrema .",
    "the third estimator ( which is typically most accurate ) is based on the joint distribution of the independent extrema .",
    "the biased estimators can be used to bind the true option price by a confidence interval .",
    "numerical examples indicate that the biases rapidly decrease as @xmath2 increases in comparison to the bias in the standard discrete - time method and the convergence rate depends on the correlation and barrier structures of the underlying assets .",
    "finally we discuss the application of our biased estimators for the valuation of knock - in , cash - at - hit rebates options , lookback options and credit derivatives .",
    "consider the knock - out option @xmath3 written on the underlying assets @xmath4 .",
    "the option payout at maturity @xmath5 is some function @xmath6 if the underlying assets never hit the fixed boundaries @xmath7 $ ] and zero otherwise . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are the upper and lower barriers .",
    "hereafter , we use vector notation to simultaneously compare all vector components . for example , @xmath10 is used to denote @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "assume that the underlying assets follow risk - neutral geometric brownian motion    @xmath13 = \\rho _ { ij } ( t)dt,\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 is the @xmath15-th asset price today , @xmath16 is the @xmath17-dimensional wiener process , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the drifts and volatilities respectively .",
    "let us consider the time slices @xmath20 , @xmath21 ordered as @xmath22 , @xmath23 and denote @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that the drifts , volatilities , correlation coefficients and boundaries are piecewise constant functions of time such that @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 if @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "let us also introduce the indicator function of the barrier hit at discrete times @xmath32 by    @xmath33    in the absence of arbitrage the true option price at @xmath34 can be written as an expectation    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the _ risk - neutral _ probability density function of the asset value @xmath37 at @xmath38 given the asset value @xmath39 at @xmath20 .",
    "the function should satisfy the kolmogorov forward equation ( also known as the fokker - planck equation ) with the absorbing boundaries @xmath40 $ ] , see cox and miller ( 1965 ) .",
    "also we have absorbed the present value discount factor into the payoff function @xmath6 and used the short vector notation for the multi - dimensional integral ] .    the explicit solution of the kolmogorov forward equation for the transition probability function @xmath41 to unrestricted process ( [ eq1 ] ) over the interval @xmath42 $ ] ( without absorbing boundaries ) is the @xmath17-variate lognormal distribution with the means : @xmath43\\delta t_m - \\ln s_i ^{(m)}$ ] , variances : @xmath44 , and linear correlation coefficients : @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",

    "this is because we lose information on the continuous - time path between sampling dates .",
    "the bias decreases very slowly as @xmath56 for @xmath57 ( see andersen ( 1996 ) and broadie , glasserman and kou ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "thus a large number of sampling dates is usually required to obtain an accurate estimate of the option price with continuously monitored barriers .",
    "for example , the bias is still larger than 1% of the true price even for 1024 time steps for the case of the standard down - and - out call , see table 1 .",
    "extrapolation to the continuous limit is complicated by finite sampling errors of the monte carlo estimates .",
    "this makes the estimator ( [ eq5 ] ) computationally expensive .",
    "being mainly interested in eliminating ( reducing ) the biases unaffected by the number of paths , hereafter in formulae , we omit the dependence of the monte carlo estimates upon @xmath54 assuming that @xmath54 is large enough to make the statistical errors negligibly small in comparison to the biases ( we will present the standard errors in the numerical examples ) .",

    "one has to simulate the asset path at @xmath20 , @xmath67 according to the standard procedure ( [ eq4 ] ) .",

    "this is similar to the results for double barrier call in table 2 and figure 1 , because the assets have a perfect negative dependence and the option is equivalent to a single asset knock - out option with the flat lower and exponentially growing upper barriers .",

    "we have observed that the convergence rate smoothly deteriorates from the best exponential decay @xmath193 at @xmath188 to a rapid power decay @xmath194 at @xmath175 and slow square root decreasing @xmath195 at @xmath176 as the correlation is changed between @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",

    "the exact ( analytical ) result is not available for this problem .",
    "explicit expressions for the probability bounds ( [ eq13 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) used in the biased estimators ( [ eq15 ] ) are given by ( [ eq20 ] ) . as we have chosen positive correlation between all assets",
    "the asset minima are positively dependent .",
    "thus @xmath129 is always less than the unbiased estimator @xmath3 and we present the results for @xmath206 which is a better point estimate for the true price than @xmath162 . as in the previous examples , all our biased estimators @xmath131 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are rapidly convergent to each other .",
    "their biases become less than the statistical errors for @xmath186 while the bias of the standard estimator @xmath88 is larger than its standard error even for @xmath207 .",
    "in this paper we have developed a conditioning technique , that can be called a brownian bridge scheme , for monte carlo simulation of a general class of multi - asset options with continuously monitored knock - out barriers imposed for some or all underlying assets .",
    "we have derived the general formula ( [ eq8 ] ) for an unbiased estimator of the option based on the joint distribution of the multi - dimensional brownian bridge extrema ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "if the distribution is known , for example , one barrier imposed on one of the assets ( or two barriers imposed on different or the same assets ) per time region , the scheme provides a simple unbiased estimator .",
    "the barriers , drifts and volatilities are required to be piecewise constant functions of time . in the case of more than two barriers per time",
    "region the distribution is unknown in a closed form for arbitrary dependence between the assets and we derived the upper , @xmath131 , and lower , @xmath130 , biased option price estimators .",
    "the estimators are based on the frchet lower , @xmath103 , and upper , @xmath100 , bounds ( [ eq13 ] ) for the unknown joint distribution with given univariate margins .",
    "we have also used the estimator @xmath129 based on the joint distribution of independent extrema , @xmath184 . for",
    "some simple barrier and dependence structures @xmath129 can provide better upper or lower bounds . while this estimator is usually more accurate ,",
    "@xmath130 and @xmath131 are often more useful because they can always be used to bind the true option price by the confidence interval . as the time between the sampling dates decreases , the brownian bridge extrema",
    "become more disjointed and the biased estimators @xmath130 ,",
    "@xmath129 , @xmath131 converge to each other and the true value . in the limit ,",
    "the option price estimator becomes independent of the dependence structure ( the so - called copula ) of the extrema and depends on their marginal distributions only . in our numerical examples we showed that the bias @xmath163 is less and convergence is rapid when compared to the bias and convergence of the standard estimator @xmath88 ( @xmath208 for @xmath190 , where @xmath150",
    "usually , @xmath163 is less than the statistical error of the estimates for only a few time steps . in practice , the intermediate dates are introduced due to the interest rate or volatility term - structures and the insertion of the additional sampling dates to eliminate the bias may not be even required .",
    "the convergence rate depends on the barrier and correlation structures .",
    "we have always observed @xmath209 for the case of lower and upper barriers imposed on the same asset . for the case of two lower barriers imposed on two assets",
    "the best detected convergence rate is exponential decay @xmath201 and the worst detected rate is slow square root decreasing @xmath210 .",
    "the worst case was obtained for the unrealistic special set of parameters ( @xmath198 and identical parameters for both assets ) which makes barrier hits always equal each other and @xmath131 to be an unbiased estimator of the true price .    the described brownian bridge technique is straightforward to use for the valuation of the knock - in barrier options and barrier options with constant rebates , @xmath211 , paid at maturity .",
    "the unbiased estimators in these cases are given by          respectively .",
    "the upper and lower biased estimators can easily be calculated using @xmath103 and @xmath100 .",
    "the technique can easily be applied to efficiently estimate discretely monitored barrier options with a large number of observation dates using the method proposed by andersen ( 1996 ) . that is , using our scheme calculate the continuously monitored barrier option price @xmath214 and using the standard monte carlo method estimate the option with a low frequency monitored barrier . then the interpolation formula @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is a barrier option with @xmath2 monitored dates , allows for effective estimation of the option with a high frequency monitored barrier .",
    "finding the upper and lower biased estimators is not straightforward for the case of multi - barrier options with rebates paid at hitting times .",
    "this type of problem is also relevant to the valuation of credit derivatives . to calculate the unbiased option price estimator",
    ", multiple hitting times should be simulated from their valid joint distribution which is not known even for the case of two barriers .",
    "however , the hitting times can easily be simulated from their known univariate marginal distributions , see anderson ( 1996 ) .",
    "thus , again we have a problem of the unknown joint distribution with the known univariate margins .",
    "such options can be evaluated in the following way .",
    "calculate one option estimate @xmath217 simulating the hitting times marginally with perfect positive dependence with continuous marginal distributions @xmath218 and perfect positive dependence can be simulated as @xmath219 , where @xmath80 is a random variable from @xmath220 . if @xmath221 have a perfect negative dependence then @xmath222 , @xmath223 . if @xmath224 are independent then @xmath225 , where @xmath226 are independent random variables from @xmath220 . ] .",
    "another estimate @xmath227 can be found by simulating the events marginally with perfect negative dependence in the case of two barriers or simulating the events independently if there are more than two barriers .",
    "the difference between @xmath217 and @xmath227 can be used as a weak criterion for the disjointed events to justify their marginal simulations .",
    "that is , if the difference is less than the statistical error then the events can be assumed disjointed enough ( marginal simulation is justified ) and @xmath228 can be used as a point estimate for the true price .",
    "otherwise additional sampling dates need to be inserted .",
    "lookback type options with payoff dependent on a few continuous extrema can be evaluated in a similar way .",
    "we will consider these problems in further research .    in all our examples we have assumed the lognormal diffusion process ( [ eq1 ] ) to allow for comparison with analytical results .",
    "however , the brownian bridge scheme discussed here is still applicable for more general diffusion processes . for example , it is applicable if drifts and volatilities are state - dependent . to solve these models approximate",
    "discretisation schemes freezing the drifts and volatilities to the left point of each simulation step are used , see for example kloeden and platen ( 1992 ) .",
    "then brownian bridge schemes can be used because the requirements of piecewise constant drifts and volatilities are satisfied .",
    "this will eliminate the bias due to discrete underestimation of the continuous extrema ( bias due to the discretisation scheme will not be removed ) .    in this paper",
    "we have focused on the application of the technique for the valuation of simple knock - out multi - asset options .",
    "however , practical use of the technique lies in a broad range of problems .",
    "for example , the technique can potentially be used for credit and market risk problems where valuation of a multi - asset payoff with some barrier levels imposed on the underlying assets is very essential ."
