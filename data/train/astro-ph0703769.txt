    "the galactic center offers a unique opportunity for studying star formation and stellar populations near a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , namely , sgr  a*. active galactic nuclei and supernovae feedback have been evoked to explain many of the observed inhomogeneities in different galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is only in our own galaxy that we are able to resolve individual stars within the circumnuclear ring surrounding the central smbh @xcite . within the milky way ,",
    "the cluster of stars at the galactic center is also unique in that it is comprised of both old and young stars ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is believed that the young stellar population is the result of a burst of star formation at the galactic center a few megayears ago @xcite , and that perhaps sgr  a * was more actively accreting mass then than it is observed to be today .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that the stellar initial mass function near a smbh is top heavy @xcite , implying that the galactic center is a viable location for finding highly massive stars .",
    "photometric variability is one way of probing the mixed galactic center stellar population on a large scale , as both evolved low mass and high mass stars are prone to photometric variations .    there have been several photometric variability studies of the galactic center , some of which we summarize in table  [ tbl : surveys ] . while some of these studies have covered a much longer baseline than ours",
    "does ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with more than 130 epochs in each band , our light curves have a much higher sampling .",
    "these data also represent the first major multi - wavelength photometric variability study of the galactic center since @xcite .",
    "we present here our catalog of 110 variable stars within @xmath6  pc of sgr  a * , including 14 periodic sources .",
    "we outline our observations in   [ sec : obs ] . in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we discuss the reduction of data with image subtraction .",
    "we discuss our variable selection in ",
    "[ sec : selection ] , and we present the catalog of variables and their light curves along with a discussion of some of the more well - known and interesting objects in   [ sec : catalog ] .",
    "we adopt a galactocentric distance of 7.6  kpc @xcite .",
    "the observations from which irs  16sw was studied by @xcite and @xcite were of a field of view of @xmath7 arcseconds ( 4.12  pc projected ) approximately centered on the galactic center ; we describe here the stellar photometric variability in these data .",
    "the observations of the galactic center were made from 20002002 at the cerro - tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio)/yale 1-m telescope using the facility optical / infrared imager ( andicam ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "andicam has a pixel scale of @xmath8  pix@xmath9 on a @xmath10 array .",
    "both @xmath1- and @xmath2-band ( centered at 1.6@xmath11 m  and 2.2@xmath11 m  respectively ) images were taken in the 2001 and 2002 observing seasons ; @xmath1-band data were also obtained in 2000 . the observing campaign consists of every usable night from utc 2000 august 13 through utc 2000 october 14 , utc 2001 may 20 through utc 2001",
    "november 3 , and utc 2002 june 9 through utc 2002",
    "september 25 .",
    "each night , a set of seven slightly offset images were obtained and then combined and trimmed ( decreasing the field of view ) to form a final nightly image . the @xmath1-band images consist of 30  s exposures , and it took about four minutes to obtain the group of seven images ; the @xmath2-band images consist of 10  s exposures and took about two minutes to obtain .",
    "after image quality cuts were made , there are a total of 133 @xmath1-band images spanning 774 nights and 134 @xmath2-band images spanning 495 nights .",
    "the full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ; in general , the @xmath1-band images are of somewhat higher quality ( typical fwhm @xmath14 ) than the @xmath2-band ( with typical fwhm @xmath15 ) .",
    "the final @xmath1- and @xmath2-band images are also offset relative to one another by @xmath16 ; most of the stars detected in only one of the two bands are due to this offset .",
    "because the field is crowded , we reduced the data with the isis image subtraction package @xcite following the procedures outlined by @xcite .",
    "isis measures the change in flux for an object relative to a reference image , after correcting for the relative change in the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "our reference images ( and thus `` fiducial '' magnitudes ) for both bands are based on images from the 2001 observing season .",
    "the reference @xmath1-band image is presented in figure  [ fig : himage ] .",
    "we identified the stars running daophot / allstar progam @xcite on the astrometric reference image for each band .",

    "we based the astrometric and photometric calibration on the 2mass catalog @xcite .",
    "for the astrometry , we obtained an astrometric solution by matching the 2mass @xmath2-band catalog to our @xmath2-band data .",
    "we similarly solved for the coordinate transformation between the @xmath1- and @xmath2-band data sets , which enabled us to find the coordinates of sources detected only in @xmath1 band .",
    "the astrometric solution is good to @xmath21 in ra and @xmath22 in dec ( about @xmath23  pixel in both coordinates ) .",
    "we calibrated our absolute photometry using this same set of stars matched to the 2mass catalog ; the photometric calibration error is @xmath24  mag .    we define the limiting magnitude for each band to be where the magnitude distribution peaks , as denoted by the vertical dashed lines in figure  [ fig : mags ] ; this is approximately the magnitude at which the sky level starts to dominate the signal .",
    "the limiting @xmath1-band magnitude is 15.1  mag , and the limiting @xmath2-band magnitude is 12.6  mag ; because these magnitude determinations are based on composite images ( as opposed to individual images ) ,",
    "the actual limiting magnitudes for individual observations of variable sources are significantly lower . the color - magnitude diagram is presented in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the easiest to identify variable stars are those which vary about a mean magnitude more than typical stars of the same average mangitude . we therefore flagged potential variables independently in both @xmath1- and @xmath2-bands according to a root - mean - squared ( rms ) cut , as shown in figure  [ fig : rms ] .",
    "the cutoffs are given by @xmath25 this led to @xmath26 of @xmath1-band sources and @xmath27 of @xmath2-band sources being flagged as potential variables .",
    "each potential variable was visually inspected by two of us ( m.s.p .  and k.z.s . ) , and flagged as `` periodic '' ( if an aov test yielded a believable period ) , `` long term , '' `` suspected , '' or not variable .",
    "we also performed two period searches ( aov and ls ; @xcite ) of all of the sources .",
    "these searches revealed only two periodic sources not already flagged by the rms cut as well as three other clearly variable , low - amplitude non - periodic sources .",
    "the final sample includes 93 sources with both @xmath1- and @xmath2-band light curves , 14 of which are periodic , as well as 10 stars identified only in @xmath1-band and 7 stars identified only in @xmath2 .",
    "the distribution of magnitudes for all of the variable sources are shown as the shaded regions of the histograms in figure  [ fig : mags ] .",
    "several of the sources flagged as variables were clearly blended , i.e. , nearby stars show similar light - curve shapes .",
    "as described in   4.6 of @xcite , the true variable is the one which displays the greatest amplitude of variability in flux .",
    "thus , while in most cases we have not attempted to correct for blending , we are able to identify which sources are the true variables .",
    "the positions and magnitudes of our variable sources without clear period determinations are given in table  [ tbl : vary ] , and the light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : lcs ] ,  [ fig : lch ] , and  [ fig : lck ] .",

    "the shape of the light curve of psd  35.6 - 35.4 remains reminiscent of a pulsating variable ; a steep brigtening is followed by a longer fall - time .",
    "the light curve of psd  38.3 - 36.7 , however , is much more symmetric ; it is possible that it is an eclipsing binary , perhaps similar to those found by @xcite in the large magellenic cloud .",
    "if this is the case , then like irs  16sw ( see    [ sec:16sw ] ) it is both close to in contact ( because the light curve does not flatten out of eclipse ) , composed of near - equal surface brightness stars ( because the depths of the eclipses are the same ) , and we are viewing it almost edge - on ( because the depths of the eclipses are close to 0.75  mag ) .",

    "<S> our images were obtained over 133 nights from 2000 to 2002 in @xmath1-band and over 134 nights from 2001 to 2002 in @xmath2-band ; the typical fwhm is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we match the catalog to other near - infrared , x - ray , and radio ( i.e. , maser ) data , and we discuss some of the more interesting objects . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog includes 14 sources with measurable periods , several known long - period variables and three new lpv candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we associate irs  10 * with oh , sio , and h@xmath4o masers and a bright x - ray point source ; this analysis suggests irs  10 * is an agb star with an accreting companion . among the @xmath5 newly discovered sources are a probable cataclysmic variable , a potential edge - on contact 84  day period eclipsing binary , and a possible 41  day period pulsating variable </S>"
