    "over the last few decades there has been great interest in the study of search problems that appear in various contexts from animal foraging , protein binding on dna , internet search algorithms to locate one s misplaced keys . in such different situations ,",
    "one important issue is to consider optimal search strategies .",
    "for example , in protein binding on dna , a protein molecule binds to a specific target binding site on dna by an appropriate mixture of 3d diffusion and 1d sliding motion on dna  called facilitated diffusion @xcite .",
    "quite often efficient search strategies involve a mixture of local steps and long - range moves .",
    "such search strategies are called intermittent search process and are observed in foraging animals such as humming birds or bumblebees @xcite .",
    "the e. coli bacteria alternatively uses ballistic moves , called `` runs '' with random `` tumbles '' , to change its direction in order to reach high food concentration regions @xcite .",
    "recently , an intermittent stochastic strategy containing such a mixture of local and long - range moves has been introduced @xcite in which diffusion of a particle is interrupted by stochastically resetting it to a preferred position whereupon the diffusion process starts afresh .",
    "examples of such stochastic resetting are found in a wide variety of situations . in daily life , while searching for some lost possession , after an unsuccessful search for some duration of time one often goes back to the starting place and recommences the search process again . in the ecological context ,",
    "the movement of animals during foraging period often involves local diffusive search for food @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such local diffusive movements are interrupted by long range moves to relocate themselves in other areas and after that local diffusive motion restarts from the relocation region@xcite .",
    "movement of free - ranging capuchin monkeys in the wild is described quite well by random walks with preferential relocations to places visited in the past @xcite .",
    "there are other examples in nature where similar notions of stochastic resetting can also be found .",
    "for example , in the biological context several living organisms use stochastic switching between different phenotypic states to adapt in a fluctuating environment @xcite .",
    "stochastic restarts are often considered as a useful strategy to optimize computer search algorithms in hard combinatorial problems @xcite .",
    "also in the context of population growth , random catastrophic events may cause a sudden reduction in the population size and reset it to some lower value .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mechanism of stochastic resetting fundamentally affects the properties of diffusion process .",
    "consider a particle , starting from @xmath2 , diffusing in one dimension .",
    "let @xmath3 be its position at time @xmath1 .",
    "along with diffusion , the particle is subject to a resetting mechanism in which its motion is interrupted stochastically such that the position of the particle is reset to some fixed position @xmath4 at some rate @xmath5 and after every such event the particle recommences its diffusive motion . in the absence of resetting ,",
    "the gaussian distribution of the position of the particle never reaches a steady state .",
    "the width of the distribution keeps on growing with time as @xmath6 . on the other hand , in the presence of resetting the distribution of the position",
    "becomes a globally current - carrying non - equilibrium steady state with non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "resetting also has another important consequence on the properties of diffusion process : the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) to a particular position of a diffusing particle is infinite whereas it becomes finite in presence of resetting .",
    "in fact there is an optimal resetting rate @xmath5 for which this finite mfpt is minimum .    in the last decades",
    ", several theoretical works have been dedicated to the study of first - passage properties of intermittent search processes , and in particular to the question of the minimization of the mean first - passage time i.e. the mean time to locate some target @xcite .",
    "these works use different analytical and numerical approaches to minimize the mfpt in a broad range of contexts such as search processes mixing slow diffusive movement and fast ballistic motion @xcite , persistent random walks @xcite , finding targets in a domain @xcite and brownian search in spatial heterogeneous media @xcite .",
    "also in @xcite , an intermittent search process with levy flights interrupted by random resettings has been studied where a first order phase transition associated to a discontinuous change in the optimal parameters has been observed . recently",
    "a number of generalizations of the simple diffusion with resetting have been made .",
    "the generalization from the one - dimensional case to higher dimensions has been considered in @xcite . in the context of a target search process",
    ", the effect of partial absorption has been considered in @xcite .",
    "properties of non - equilibrium steady state for diffusion with resetting have been studied in the presence of a potential @xcite or in a bounded domain @xcite .",
    "other generalizations include resetting to the current maximum of the brownian particle @xcite , resetting in continuous - time random walks @xcite , in lvy flights @xcite etc .",
    "the effect of resetting in the dynamics of interacting multi - particle systems such as fluctuating interfaces @xcite , coagulation - diffusion process @xcite and in general chemical reaction schemes @xcite have been studied .    in this paper",
    "we consider a different generalization of the resetting process : we consider a resetting rate @xmath0 that is _ time - dependent_. this generalization is quite natural in the context of target search .",
    "while searching for a lost object , the searcher naturally would not like to reset in the beginning of the search , but as time progresses without success , the searcher would be more and more inclined to go back to the most likely location and start the search process anew . as a result",
    "it would be quite natural to consider a situation where the resetting rate @xmath0 grows from zero as time increases .",
    "specifically , we consider a situation where the resetting rate depends on the _ time since the last reset_. thus the rate as well as the searcher is reset at the resetting event .    in the case of time - independent resetting rates ,",
    "the _ renewal property _ of brownian motion has been exploited to compute the propagator ( the probability density of the particle being at @xmath7 at time @xmath1 given that it began at @xmath2 at time 0 ) as well as the steady - state distribution of the position of the particle @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the propagator has been expressed as an integral over the time of the _ last resetting events_. for time dependent resetting rates , we find that it is more convenient to express the propagator of the particle as an integral over the time of _ first resetting events_. we refer to this formalism as the _ first renewal picture _ in contrast to the formalism used in @xcite which we refer to as the _ last renewal picture_. we first recapitulate the constant resetting rate case in sec . [ recap - const - r ] where we re - derive the known results using the _ first renewal picture_. then in sec .",
    "[ time - dep - r ] we discuss the generalization of this approach to the time dependent case , where we compute the laplace transform ( w.r.t .",
    "time ) of the propagator for a general resetting rate function @xmath0 .",
    "next we study the steady - state properties of the brownian particle subject to such a resetting mechanism . in the absence of resetting ,",
    "the brownian particle keeps on diffusing freely over space with time ; but the introduction of a resetting mechanism creates a current towards the reset position .",
    "this current may balance the outward current ( flowing towards infinity ) in the large time limit . as a result",
    "the system may reach a steady state eventually but _ not _ for all possible choices of the rate function @xmath0 .",
    "the question is then for what choices of @xmath0 will a steady state be attained ?",
    "we address this question in sec .",
    "[ ss - time - dep - r ] , where we study the steady - state behavior of the brownian particle in presence of a time - dependent resetting rate .",
    "we find a sufficient condition on the late time behavior of @xmath0 for a steady state to be attained which is given by equation ( [ sscond ] ) . such a condition can be easily understood as follows : let us consider the following two extreme cases , a ) @xmath8 and b ) @xmath9 . in the former case , the particle is always instantaneously reset to the resetting position @xmath4 and hence the probability distribution of the position is then given by @xmath10 irrespective of the initial position @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath11 , the particle diffuses freely and never attains a steady state distribution ( on an infinite system ) .",
    "hence if @xmath0 decays fast enough to zero as time increases , then the particle may have finite probability of not being reset at all and as a result the distribution of the position of the particle may not reach a steady state .",
    "in fact we find that if @xmath0 decays slower than @xmath12 for large @xmath1 , then the particle reaches a steady state .",
    "the next question is : how does it relax to the steady state , if indeed one exists ?",
    "this question was first studied by majumdar _",
    "et al _ @xcite in the context of constant resetting rate case .",
    "they found that for a given large time @xmath1 , the distribution in an inner core region around the reset position has already relaxed to the ( time - independent ) steady state whereas the distribution in the outer region has not yet relaxed .",
    "the front dividing the relaxed from the non - relaxed region moves linearly with time through the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ltd ] we observe the same phenomena for a specific class of time dependent resetting rate function @xmath13 .",
    "however , depending on the value of @xmath14 , the motion of the front becomes linear , superlinear or sublinear with @xmath1 .",
    "one of the main motivations for studying brownian motion with resetting is to improve our understanding of search paradigms , as discussed in the first and second paragraphs of the introduction . as a quantitative measure of the performance of a search process",
    ", one may consider the mean search time or the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) @xmath15 to a static target for a given starting position @xmath2 and diffusion constant @xmath16 .",
    "in the absence of resetting , the mfpt of a free brownian particle to a static target at origin is infinite . on the other hand , in the presence of resetting to the initial position with constant rate @xmath17 ,",
    "the mfpt becomes finite @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has also been shown @xcite that there exists an optimal choice of the constant rate @xmath18 for which mfpt @xmath15 becomes minimum . in this work",
    "we ask the following questions : can this scenario be improved further if one considers a time - dependent resetting rate @xmath0 ?",
    "what is the optimal rate function @xmath0 for which the mfpt @xmath15 becomes minimum ?",
    "we address these questions in sec .",
    "[ survival_probability ] and sec .",
    "[ optimal - r(t ) ] respectively .",
    "we show that indeed there exists a few choices of @xmath0 for which it is possible to achieve a mfpt lower than the minimum mfpt obtained using constant resetting rate @xmath18 . in sec .",
    "[ optimal - r(t ) ] we study the optimal resetting rate function , where we conjecture that the optimal time - dependent rate function is given by a threshold function .",
    "we note that several very recent works have also considered the problem of time - dependent resetting .",
    "eule and metzger @xcite use a generalized ( non - markovian ) master equation approach to consider the stationary distribution of the particle position and also some late time properties . in that work a gamma - distribution of waiting times between successive reset events",
    "is considered and mean first passage times are numerically determined .",
    "nagar and gupta @xcite consider the particular case of a power law distribution of waiting times between resets .",
    "they discuss the steady states and some first passage time properties .",
    "in contrast , in our work we consider the general scenario of a time - dependent resetting rate @xmath0 ( with corresponding waiting time distribution @xmath19 given by ( [ rate1 ] ) ) for various different choices of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore we consider the late time relaxation of the probability distribution and we study analytically the problem of optimising the mean first passage time .",
    "first let us define diffusion with resetting with time - dependent resetting rate .",
    "we consider a single particle ( or searcher ) in one dimension with initial position @xmath2 at @xmath20 and a resetting position @xmath21 .",
    "the position @xmath3 of the particle at time @xmath1 is updated by the following stochastic rule : in a small time interval @xmath22 the position @xmath3 becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the time of the last resetting event .",
    "thus the resetting rate @xmath25 is a function of the _ time elapsed since the last resetting event_. in ( [ rule.1 ] ) @xmath26 is a gaussian white noise with mean and two - time correlator given by ( t)=0 ,  ( t)(t)=2d(t - t ) , where @xmath16 is the diffusion constant . here",
    ", angular brackets denote averaging over noise realizations .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath27 . to simplify matters , from now on",
    "we shall take the initial position to coincide with the resetting position x(0)=x_0 = x_r , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the dynamics thus consists of a stochastic mixture of resetting to the initial position with rate @xmath25 ( long range move ) and ordinary diffusion ( local move ) with diffusion constant @xmath16 .",
    "we define @xmath28 as the probability of finding the particle at position @xmath7 at time @xmath1 , given that it was at @xmath2 at time @xmath20 in the presence of _ time - independent _ stochastic resetting , @xmath29 being the same quantity for the _ time - dependent _ stochastic resetting . in both cases",
    "the suffix ` @xmath5 ' indicates the presence of resetting .      for completeness",
    "we review here the formalism and the results for the case of constant resetting rate @xmath17 @xcite . in this case",
    ", one can write down a master equation for @xmath28 from the dynamical rules for the evolution of the particle given in the preceding section @xcite = d - r_cp_r+r_c(x - x_0 ) , transient with the initial condition @xmath30 . for convenience",
    ", we have omitted the arguments of @xmath28 in the above equation . here ,",
    "the second and third terms on the right hand side ( rhs ) account for the resetting events , denoting , respectively , the negative probability flux @xmath31 from each point @xmath7 and a corresponding positive probability flux into @xmath32 .",
    "the steady - state solution for the time - independent case @xmath33 satisfies 0=d -r_cp_r^st+r_c(x - x_0 ) .",
    "ss1    alternatively , a renewal picture which we refer to as the _ last renewal picture _ may be used to write down an equation for @xmath28 in terms of the free propagator @xmath34 for a pure diffusive process ( without resetting ) as in @xcite p_r(x , t|x_0,0)&=&e^-r_ctg(x , t|x_0,0 ) + & + & r_c_0^td_l  e^-r_c(t-_l )  g(x , t-_l|x_0,0 ) .",
    "lr1ti here , we have divided the process into two contributions .",
    "the first term in the rhs signifies that there has been no reset at all between time @xmath35 with the probability of no resets given by @xmath36 .",
    "this probability is then simply multiplied by the free brownian propagator g(x , t|x_0,0)=  .",
    "[ bp1 ] the second term in the rhs accounts for the fact that there can be multiple resets : the integral sums over contributions in which the _ last resetting _ event takes place between time @xmath24 and @xmath37 .",
    "subsequently , the particle propagates freely until the observation time scale @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown that  ( [ lr1ti ] ) satisfies the master equation  ( [ transient ] ) .",

    "l  g(x,_l|x_0,0 )  , [ rtist ] which satisfies the steady state equation given by  ( [ ss1 ] ) .",
    "the integral ( [ rtist ] ) can be evaluated to yield @xcite @xmath38 the last resetting equation ( [ lr1ti ] ) also allows the long time relaxation to the steady state to be analyzed @xcite as we shall review in section  [ sec : ltd ] .    in this work",
    "we introduce a _ first renewal picture _ where instead of the last resetting , we consider the _ first resetting _ between time @xmath39 and @xmath40 having started from @xmath20 .",
    "subsequently , the particle diffuses from @xmath39 until time @xmath1 , in the presence of multiple resets .",
    "it is again straightforward to write down an equation for the probability p_r(x , t|x_0,0)&=&e^-r_ctg(x , t|x_0,0 ) + & + & r_c_0^td_f  e^-r_c(t-_f )  p_r(x , t|x_0,_f )  , lr2 where the first term in the rhs corresponds to trajectories in which there are no resets at all .",
    "the integral in the second term sums over trajectories in which there has been a first reset between time @xmath39 and @xmath40 and then there can be multiple resets which is taken care of by the reset propagator @xmath28 inside the integral .",
    "the equivalence between  ( [ lr1ti ] ) and  ( [ lr2 ] ) is easy to show by taking laplace transforms of both equations .",
    "we find that they result in identical expression in the laplace space ( x , s|x_0,0)=  ( x , r_c+s|x_0,0 )  , [ eqv1 ] where @xmath41 is the laplace transform of @xmath28 and @xmath42 is the laplace transform of @xmath34 .",
    "taking the inverse laplace transform with respect to @xmath43 , one can easily obtain  ( [ lr1ti ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the main subject of this paper , that of time - dependent resetting rates @xmath0 , as defined above . in this case",
    "one can not simply write a master equation for @xmath29 in the presence of time - dependent resetting rate .",
    "this is because one must in addition keep track of the time since the last reset .",
    "the renewal pictures are more useful than the master equation formalism to describe the time - dependent rate process . to this end",
    ", we define the following time - integrated quantity r()=_0^d r( ) .",

    "more precisely , we are interested in whether @xmath29 takes a time independent form in @xmath49 limit .",
    "if so then , in the laplace transform language , this simply means that @xmath50 should be expressible as @xmath51 multiplied by a quantity that does not depend on @xmath43 in @xmath52 limit and the steady state distribution would be given by _",

    "now it is easy to check from the definitions ( [ q_mbb_s ] ) and ( [ lpropagator2 ] ) that if @xmath53 then also @xmath54 .",
    "thus a sufficient condition on the choice of @xmath0 to achieve a steady state is that @xmath53 which implies that @xmath55 this condition implies that @xmath56 must grow sufficiently fast for large @xmath1 so that @xmath57 sufficiently quickly .    recalling the definition @xmath58 ( [ rate1 ] ) , condition ( [ sscond ] )",
    "will hold if @xmath0 is an increasing function of time since then @xmath59 .",

    "if @xmath0 is a function decreasing to zero at large time since the last reset , to achieve a steady state , it must decrease sufficiently slowly that @xmath56 diverges with time .",

    "since the optimal resetting function does not extremise the mfpt everywhere ( i.e. it does not set the functional derivative to zero everywhere ) , it must instead involve values of rates at the boundary of the allowed rate space i.e. it must involve @xmath163 ( since a rate can not be negative ) and @xmath164 .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that a possible form for the optimal resetting function is @xmath165 that is , resetting does not occur up until time @xmath166 then occurs instantaneously . or in other words there is deterministic resetting with period @xmath166 .    for @xmath0 of the form ( [ optr1 ] )",
    "the mfpt is given by @xmath167 extremising this expression with respect to @xmath166 yields the condition @xmath168 where , as usual , @xmath169 .",
    "note that the above equation can be expressed solely in terms of the rescaled variable @xmath170 as @xmath171 where @xmath172 as before .",
    "this implies that @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the solution of the above equation .",
    "one can solve this equation numerically to find @xmath175 using @xmath173 in ( [ t * ] ) one finds that the optimum mfpt is given by @xmath176 which is much smaller than the minimum mfpt @xmath177 possible for any given @xmath2 and @xmath16 using constant reset rate ( see fig .",
    "[ figmfpt2 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the mfpt @xmath15 and @xmath166 constitute a linear relation @xmath178 , for any given @xmath2 and @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ figmfpt2 ] ) .",
    "figmfpt2    furthermore we can check that the rate function @xmath0 given by  ( [ optr1 ] ) with @xmath173 , locally optimizes the mfpt with respect to variations of the rate function .",

    "@xmath183 has a single turning point as can be checked numerically .",
    "hence , in the domain @xmath187 , the function @xmath188 , is strictly positive as is the functional derivative @xmath189 .",
    "thus @xmath0 given by  ( [ optr1 ] ) is evidently a locally optimal rate function with respect to the mfpt .",
    "in this work we have considered a simple stochastic system of a brownian particle subjected to a time - dependent resetting rate to a fixed position @xmath4 .",
    "this is in contrast with earlier studies where a time independent rate was chosen .",
    "the rate of resetting @xmath0 is a function of the time @xmath1 since the last reset event .",
    "we have seen that for steady states to exist , the function @xmath0 must respect certain features such as either increasing with time , tending to some finite constant as @xmath190 or decay to zero sufficiently slow . a sufficient condition for the steady state",
    "is given by ( [ sscond ] ) .",
    "in this context , various cases for the steady state distributions have been worked out in section [ ss - time - dep - r ] .",
    "we have also considered the late time relaxation behavior of the probability distribution for the specific choices of rate function @xmath191 with @xmath192 . in analogy to recent work @xcite we have shown that an inner core region around the resetting point settles into the steady state distribution and the boundaries of the inner core region is still in transient state and move outwards towards the tails of the distribution with time .",
    "thus an ` equilibration ' front moves through the system and its motion is superlinear if @xmath128 ; linear if @xmath129 ( recovering the results of @xcite ) and sublinear but superdiffusive if @xmath130 .",
    "finally we have considered persistence properties of the brownian motion in the presence of the time dependent resetting process . in particular , we have studied extensively the first passage time properties of the brownian particle to reach the origin . we have derived a formula ( [ mfpttime2 ] ) for the mean first passage time .",
    "a primary motivation has been to optimize the mean first passage time with respect to the rate functions . to this end , we have studied thoroughly the optimal properties of the mean first passage time and have shown that a threshold function ( [ optr1 ] ) with an optimised threshold @xmath166 is at least locally optimal for the problem of minimizing the mean first passage time .",
    "it would be of great interest to see whether this is also the globally optimal function and if so , to provide a rigorous proof of this .",
    "other interesting generalizations would be to consider , for example , oscillatory reset functions or else random resetting rates chosen from a specified distribution .",
    "it would also be interesting to look at the properties of the entropy generation in the system subject to a resetting mechanism .",
    "another propitious future direction might be to study the effects of time - dependent resetting on the dynamics of interacting multi - particle systems , which could prove useful in the context of cellular biology .",
