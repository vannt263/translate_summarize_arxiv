    "multielectron bubbles ( mebs ) are typically micron - sized cavities in liquid helium , containing a nanometer thin layer of electrons on the inside of the surface of the bubble .",
    "mebs were first observed in experiments studying electrons on the surface of liquid helium beneath which an anode was present @xcite .",
    "when the charge density of the 2d - layer of electrons exceeds a critical value , a surface instability sets in @xcite and a bubble forms , carrying up to 10@xmath0 electrons to the anode .",
    "the electron system inside such a meb is of particular interest , since it forms a spherical two - dimensional electron gas whose density can be tuned over a wid e range of values depending on the number of electrons in the bubble and the pressure applied on the helium @xcite .    unlike in gas - filled bubbles ,",
    "the force preventing the bubble from imploding is not due to the pressure of a gas inside the bubble , but due to the coulomb repulsion between the electrons in the meb . at zero external pressure ,",
    "the radius @xmath1 of the bubble is determined by the balance between the coulomb repulsion and the surface tension of the helium @xcite .",
    "when the pressure @xmath2 on the helium is nonzero , the bubble radius satisfies the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electron charge , @xmath5 is the number of electrons in the meb , @xmath6 is the dielectric constant of helium , and @xmath7 is the surface tension of helium . in the regime @xmath8 the bubble radius scales as @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we investigate what happens when a bubble with radius @xmath10 in equilibrium at zero pressure is suddenly subjected to an increase in pressure .",
    "its radius is larger than the equilibrium radius at pressure @xmath2 , @xmath11 and we expect the bubble to shrink . in section",
    "ii we derive and investigate the equations of motion for the bubble dynamics , and in section iii we apply these equations to analyze the collapse dynamics of the multielectron bubble .",
    "the fact that inside meb s there are electrons ( charged particles ) instead of neutral gas atoms necessarily has another interesting consequence : the electrons in the compressing bubble are subject to accelerations , and therefore they generate electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the breathing mode of the bubble gives an estimate of the response time of the helium surface - which typically is microseconds for a 10000 electron meb . in that time span",
    ", the bubble radius shrinks a distance of typically a micrometer .",
    "the velocity corresponding to this is of the order of micrometer / microsecond or m / s .",
    "but the acceleration this generates is on the order of a micrometer / microsecond@xmath12 which is quite large ( 10@xmath13 m / s@xmath12 ) . as the number of electrons increases , the initial bubble radius increases and the maximum acceleration increases as well .",
    "we will show that ultrashort light pulses can be produced by a sudden pressure increase in the helium surrounding the meb .",
    "explanations of sonoluminescence in gas - filled bubbles @xcite have relied strongly on the emissivity of the heated gas in the collapsing gas - filled bubble @xcite , as opposed to the mechanism of sonoluminescence proposed here for multielectron bubbles",
    ". nevertheless gas - filled bubbles are known to get to temperatures where at least weak ionisation of the gas must occur @xcite , and electrons can emit light , being accelerated through scattering from the neutral atoms . although emission from accelerated electrons can contribute to the sonoluminescence of gas - filled bubbles @xcite , it s precise role is still disputed @xcite .",
    "for mebs we propose that accelerating electrons form the principal mechanism of sonoluminescence .",
    "moreover the light emission is expected to be coherent and coming from the bubble surface , whereas in gas - filled bubbles the emission is incoherent black - body emission from the interior of the bubble .",
    "the bubble surface at time @xmath14 can be described by the function @xmath15 that gives the distance from the center of the bubble to the surface , in the direction specified by the spherical coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "this function can be developed in spherical harmonics@xmath17 where @xmath1 is the angle - averaged radius of the bubble .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 describe the deformation of the bubble from its spherical shape . to derive the equations of motion for the bubble surface , we start from the bubble lagrangian derived in @xcite:@xmath19   |a_{\\ell , m}|^{2 } , \\label{lagr}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 represents the mass density of liquid helium . for small amplitude deformations of a spherical bubble , we know that @xmath21 where the @xmath22 are the spherical ripplon frequencies @xcite",

    "_ @xcite found that although a bubble deformation does lead to a redistribution of charge along the surface , the resulting shift of the ripplon frequencies is small .",
    "the reason for the weakness of the ripplon - plasmon coupling is the difference in frequency of these modes : the ripplon frequencies typically lie in the mhz - ghz range , whereas the plasmon frequencies lie in the thz range .",

    "the set of equations ( [ req1 ] ) and ( [ aeq ] ) need to be solved given appropriate initial conditions .",
    "salomaa and williams @xcite studied small - amplitude oscillations of multielectron bubbles using a similar set of equations .",
    "they neglected the contribution of the deformation amplitudes @xmath31 s in their equation for the radial component @xmath32 .",
    "this approximation is valid if @xmath33 .",
    "they found that when the ( time averaged ) bubble radius satisfies @xmath34^{1/3}$ ] , the @xmath35 deformation can grow indefinitely , suggesting an instability of the bubble . in subsequent work",
    "@xcite it was found that the @xmath35 ripplon frequency can indeed vanish , corroborating the results of salomaa and williams .",
    "however , an extension of ref . @xcite for large amplitude oscillation ( i.e. beyond the regime @xmath33 ) showed that there exists a metastability barrier preventing the bubbles from fissioning @xcite .",
    "having obtained the equations of motion for the bubble shape , we can proceed to solve them for the particular case of an meb subjected to a sudden increase in pressure .",
    "we start with a bubble whose angle - averaged radius @xmath1 is equal to the equilibrium radius @xmath36 at a given pressure @xmath37 of the liquid helium surrounding the meb . this bubble can be either spherical ( @xmath38 ) or deformed ( @xmath39 ) . at time",
    "@xmath40 the pressure of the liquid helium jumps from @xmath37 to a higher value @xmath2 .",

    "the initial conditions are @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 m - this corresponds to the @xmath51 electron bubble in equilibrium at zero pressure .",
    "the periods are @xmath56 @xmath55s , @xmath57 @xmath55s and @xmath58 @xmath55s for pressure steps of 1,2 , and 3 kpa , respectively .",
    "the radial acceleration shows a pronounced peak at the time when the meb radius is minimal ( the ` time of collapse ' ) . upon increasing the pressure , the maximum radial acceleration grows and the oscillation of the radius becomes more strongly anharmonic .",
    "there is no dissipation term in our equation for the radius , so that the radius bounces back to its original value during the periodic oscillation .",
    "dissipation will reduce this value and will let the bubble perform a damped oscillation around its new equilibrium radius @xmath59 .",
    "as can be seen from figure 1 , the time evolution of the radius of the meb is very similar to that of a gas - filled bubble subjected to a shock wave @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the restoring force opposing the collapse is the increase in pressure of the gas trapped in the bubble . in the present case",
    ", the bubble contains no gas ( except helium atoms at vapor pressure which is negligible at low temperatures ) , and it is the increased coulomb repulsion that gives rise to the restoring force .      for small - amplitude deformations , @xmath33 , we can neglect the @xmath60 terms in the equation ( [ req1 ] ) for the bubble radius , and use the solution for @xmath32 discussed in the previous section directly in the equation ( [ aeq ] ) for the deformation amplitudes .",
    "this equation can then be written as@xmath61 with the ` drag coefficient':@xmath62 and the time dependent ripplon frequency@xmath63",
    ". \\label{c2}%\\ ] ] the time dependence of these coefficients ( [ c1]),([c2 ] ) appears through the time - dependence in @xmath1 .",
    "the differential equation ( [ aeq2 ] ) can be solved numerically .",
    "the main question of this subsection concerns whether the deformations will vanish , grow without bound , or stay finite during the collapse of the bubble . from the numerical analysis",
    "we find that there are stable and unstable modes of deformation .",
    "note that even at a fixed pressure there are stable and unstable modes , as mentioned at the end of section ii .",
    "moreover , at higher pressure , more modes are unstable .",
    "when a pressure step @xmath64 is applied , a mode that was stable at the initial pressure @xmath37 may be unstable at the final pressure @xmath65 .",
    "an example of the time evolution of the amplitude of a stable mode is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "for this figure , we start with an @xmath66 electron bubble at @xmath67 that has an @xmath68 ripplon present . in this example",
    ", @xmath69 is chosen arbitrarily , but sufficiently high so that @xmath70 . under the equilibrium conditions ,",
    "the deformation amplitude oscillates with the corresponding ripplon frequency .",
    "when the pressure is suddenly increased by @xmath71 pa , we find that the oscillation perseveres , but that the oscillation amplitude is modulated with the same periodicity as the bubble radius",
    ". when the bubble radius is minimal , the oscillation amplitude of the deformation mode is maximal .",
    "this can be understood by substituting the ansatz @xmath72 in the equation of motion ( [ aeq2 ] ) .",
    "collecting the imaginary parts of this equation , we arrive at @xmath73 from which @xmath74 the constant of integration is given by @xmath75 .",
    "this solution is shown in figure [ fig2 ] by the dashed curve .",
    "it fits well with the envelope of the full numerical solution ( full curve ) , even though we started with a rather large deformation amplitude ( 10% of the radius ) in order to get a clear figure . for stable modes",
    ", we thus find that during the collapse of a deformed bubble the deformations do not vanish .",
    "the deformation amplitude grows , but is bounded at all times .",
    "an example of the time evolution of an unstable mode is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "as in figure [ fig2 ] the initial state is that of an meb with @xmath66 electrons at pressure zero , subjected to a pressure increase of @xmath76 pa .",
    "the different curves in figure [ fig3 ] represent different initial conditions , as listed in the legend .",
    "we chose the @xmath35 mode because it is known to have a vanishing frequency at positive pressures and thus may lead to instabilities .",
    "the numerical solution of ( [ aeq2 ] ) shows that the deformation amplitude @xmath77 does indeed grow to a point where it becomes comparable to the bubble radius .",
    "this indicates that the collapsing meb  in helium becomes unstable and may break up , in contrast to gas - filled bubbles in cryogenic liquids @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , at the time of smallest radius , the deformation amplitude is still smaller than the bubble radius .",
    "the point of instability ( @xmath78 ) is reached after the collapse .",
    "so , although the bubble may not survive long after the first collapse , it will reach the regime where the radial acceleration is maximal one time .",
    "how long the bubble survives after it has reached its smallest radius , depends strongly on the initial conditions of the deformation . to study the exact dynamics of the instability ( the possible fissioning ) ,",
    "the full set of equations ( [ req1]),([aeq ] ) needs to be solved .",
    "this lies beyond the scope of this paper as we want to investigate the collapse dynamics and luminescence during collapse , but not the possible breaking up of bubbles during the explosion that follows after the implosion .",
    "the electric radiation field by an accelerated charge is given by @xmath79}{|\\mathbf{r}% -\\mathbf{r}(t)|}\\right|   _ { \\text{ret } } , \\label{rad}%\\ ] ] where @xmath80 gives the trajectory of the charge @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the point in which we want to evaluate the electric radiation field , @xmath83 is the unit vector along @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the speed of light in vacuum . note that there is a non - radiative part of the electric field ( of order @xmath86^{-2}$ ] and higher ) .",
    "this is usually neglected at large distances from the accelerated electron . however ,",
    "if the radiative field is cancelled , for example by symmetry considerations , then these higher order fields come into play so that the maxwell equations remain satisfied .",
    "the subscript `` ret '' means that the electric field at time @xmath14 is generated by the accelerating electron at a time @xmath87 earlier by the delay it takes the light to reach * r*. in our situation , this retardation is of no consequence . from figure [ fig2 ] , it can be seen that though the radial velocity of the electrons is fairly high , it is not relativistic ( the acceleration , be it large , only takes place in a very short time scale ) . the power radiated per unit of solid angle per electron is @xmath88|^{2}=\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi c^{3}}|\\ddot{r}%    direction of the acceleration and * n*. thus the maximum radiated power is@xmath89 we first consider a light pulse that might be emitted by a single electron in an meb .",
    "the light pulse intensity is peaked at the instant when the bubble reaches its smallest radius , stops imploding and starts expanding again . at this point ,",
    "the radial acceleration @xmath90 is largest .",
    "this is similar to what happens in sonoluminescence in gas - filled bubbles . for bubbles with 10000 electrons , and a pressure step of 3 kpa ,",
    "a pulse of roughly 50 ns is emitted , as can be seen from figure [ fig1 ] , bearing in mind that in that case @xmath91 @xmath55s .",
    "increasing the pressure step will shorten the length of the pulse , and increase the maximum acceleration reached ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the width @xmath92 at half maximum of the peak in the radial acceleration , as a function of pressure for different numbers of electrons .",
    "large mebs ( @xmath93 ) , such as those created in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , have a very high compressibility resulting in ultrashort pulses and very large radial accelerations .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the power as a function of time ( and frequency , in the inset ) for an extreme case : an @xmath93 electron bubble subjected to a pressure step of 101.3 kpa .",
    "the ultrashort pulse reaches a maximum power of 100 @xmath55w ( i.e. @xmath94 w per electron ) . of course",
    ", one can ask whether for such an extreme case , the equation of motion ( [ req1b ] ) remains valid up to the time that the smallest radius is reached .",
    "if the surrounding helium is heated up by the radiation , or if the electrons penetrate into the helium , then the bubble implosion may have different dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , it seems safe to expect that equation ( [ req1 ] ) remains valid for a large portion of the collapse , and that for not so extreme cases the qualitative results hold .",
    "these results are that if the number of electrons or the pressure step is increased , the pulse duration shortens , the emitted spectrum shifts to higher frequencies , and the maximum power of the pulse increases .",
    "the results of the previous subsection were for one accelerating electron , or for a collection of electrons emitting radiation incoherently .",
