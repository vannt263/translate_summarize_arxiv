    "there are many experimental data on the nuclear ground state .",
    "they include the nuclear mass , form factor , binding energy , single - particle states , half lives , etc .",
    "moreover , in the future we can expect a dramatic increase in nuclear structure data due to new facilities that are ramping up or are envisioned as , for example , the future gsi facility and ria .",
    "our ability to understand the structure of the nuclear ground state is strongly connected to formulating nuclear models that deliver simultaneously a quantitative description of all measured ground - state observables .",
    "then , present ( and future ) experimental data on nuclear ground states can be given a more realistic and complete physical interpretation .",
    "observables related to the mass , densities and geometries of the nucleus as well as specific nuclear level data can be calculated with microscopic mean - field models .",
    "modern self - consistent mean - field models like the skyrme - hartree - fock ( shf ) approach ( for reviews see @xcite ) or the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model ( with finite - range mesons , rmf - fr , or point - couplings , rmf - pc ) , see refs .",
    "@xcite have reached a mature status in nuclear structure physics .",
    "they are phenomenology based and are designed to allow a description of nuclear ground states throughout the nuclear chart , with very light systems ( @xmath0 ) being the exception . with few adjustable coupling constants ( 6 - 12 ) they deliver a plethora of microscopic information for a given nucleus .",
    "their modern reinterpretation as kohn - sham schemes in the spirit of density functional theory @xcite explains their success .",
    "they can be viewed as effective field theories for nucleonic degrees of freedom below an energy scale of @xmath1  gev .",
    "short distance physics is absorbed into the various ( contact- ) terms and coupling constants .",
    "independent of the interpretation of these models , each term in the lagrangian or energy functional introduces a parameter or coupling constant that ( yet ) can not be determined from more fundamental theories .",
    "thus , the models require parameter adjustment .",
    "a good functional form with a bad fit has small predictive power , thus the adjustment procedure is critical . for the description of exotic nuclei and reliable extrapolations to the drip - lines ,",
    "a well adjusted mean - field is as important as a proper treatment of the pairing correlations and/or a possible beyond - mean - field treatment of ground - state correlations and excited states .",
    "even though the models have reached high accuracy for various observables ( we will discuss this in more detail later ) , they still exhibit significant short - comings and puzzles .",
    "some of these are : a ) the asymmetry energy of @xmath2  mev in rmf models appears to be too large compared to other accepted empirical values of @xmath3mev , b ) compared to shf , the saturation density in rmf is smaller , the energy at saturation larger , c ) there are erroneous mass and isovector trends in binding energies along isotopic and isotonic chains , d ) surface thicknesses are too small ( up to 5 % ) , e ) the compressibility @xmath4 seems to be determined in the rmf - pc variant ( @xmath5  mev ) , while rmf - fr forces with values between @xmath6  mev exhibit roughly comparable predictive power for ground - state properties , f ) axial fission barriers for actinides and superheavy nuclei tend to be systematically lower for rmf compared to shf , g ) within rmf the neutron matter equation of state is too stiff for high densities , h ) pseudo - spin splittings in rmf are too large @xcite , and i ) the available types of ground - state observables are ( yet ) not sufficient to uniquely determine all of the coupling constants .",
    "note that the asymmetry energy of rmf models with density - dependent coupling constants is about @xmath7 mev @xcite . for a more detailed description of these short - comings ,",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the influence of certain methods of parameter adjustment on the resulting model , and its sensitivity to selection of observables and weights . the consequences and issues related to the adjustment of phenomenological mean - field models are valid for a variety of other models and applications .",
    "we first describe the model with which we perform our studies .",
    "we then discuss different adjustment protocols .",
    "this is followed by specification of the possible sets of measured observables and their weights .",
    "the influence of these two topics on the resulting effective forces is then presented and discussed .",
    "for our studies we employ the point - coupling variant of the rmf model .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that - with differences in detail - this model performs very similar to the conventional rmf - fr approach with finite - range fields . yet , except for density profiles , which in the rmf - pc are smoother and resemble the ones obtained in shf calculations , little sensitivity of observables with respect to mesons versus point couplings and derivatives has been found . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the performance of various self - consistent models , including the point - coupling approach , are discussed .",

    "in each adjustment , the pairing strengths are adjusted simultaneously with the mean - field parameters .",
    "there are 11 coupling constants in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrang ] ) and a total of 13 coupling constants  including the pairing strengths for protons and neutrons  to be determined .",
    "this model has been employed to adjust the rmf - pc force pc - f1 @xcite . based on experience",
    ", it contains a minimal number of terms necessary for a description of nuclear ground states comparable to established rmf - fr models .",
    "we note that only the direct coulomb term is employed .",
    "we have studied the coulomb exchange in slater approximation ( as it is used in shf calculations ) and have learned that its effect constitutes a rather small correction for observables such as binding energies and radii .",
    "its effect can be balanced by a rearrangement ( readjustment ) of the mean - field coupling constants .",
    "this does not , however , exclude the necessity for more general coulomb exchange - correlation development in future models .",
    "the adjustment of mean - field models is a non - straightforward and biased endeavor .",
    "first of all , there is no _ canonical _ way to do it .",
    "one has the freedom of choosing various kinds of observables and nuclei and of choosing the various uncertainties that enter the @xmath10 for the least - squares adjustment . whereas some choices are obvious as , for example , binding energy as the most accurately measured ground - state observable , additional observables are not as obvious .",
    "possible choices include rms radii , diffraction radii , surface thicknesses , neutron radii , spin - orbit splittings , pseudo observables like nuclear matter properties , and more .",
    "each parameter adjustment is a balancing act between different types of observables , where the balance is influenced by the properties of the model and the weights for the various observable types .",
    "as we will see , current mean - field models exhibit a competition between the binding energy and the form factor - related observables in the fit .",
    "the nuclei chosen are usually spherical nuclei .",
    "adjustments for deformed nuclei are more difficult .    the principle problem in the adjustment of the model parameters arises from the complicated structure of the @xmath10 hyper - surface .",
    "it usually exhibits several separated local minima and its complicated structure results from its dimension of @xmath11 and the nonlinear dependence of the observables on the coupling constants .",
    "often , different minima differ by the ability of the model to describe certain kinds of observables ( energy , radii , ... ) better than others .",
    "also , we have sometimes found minima with quite low @xmath10 values and a good description of the fit data , but with less predictive power for the same observables in other nuclei .",
    "we interpret these cases as an indication that our interaction lagrangian @xmath12 is not ( yet ) complete .",
    "changing the adjustment protocol , i.e. , the choice of observables ( see next section for a detailed description ) changes the parameters , but this solution will still remain close to the point where it started , or , put differently , the relative minimum will still be the same when one uses down - hill methods which - in each step - try to lower @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , monte - carlo methods like simulated annealing ( sa ) or genetic algorithms ( ga ) allow one to leave a certain region in parameter space and explore the surrounding region .",
    "simulated annealing explores the @xmath10 landscape by accepting  with a certain probability that depends on an external temperature  parameter configurations that increase @xmath10 .",
    "thus , local minima can be left and ridges can be overcome . with decreasing temperature , the probability for accepting higher @xmath10 configurations decreases , so that the algorithm slowly settles down in a minimum .",
    "genetic algorithms obtain their ability to roam the parameter space by recombining different parameter vectors , their mutation and then selection of the best solutions in terms of _",
    "ga can also be combined with _",
    "local optimization _ with down - hill algorithms such as the ones described below .",
    "our experience to date is that for new forces , a monte - carlo type search is mandatory for a first exploration of parameter space .",
    "once several regions around minima have been identified , down - hill algorithms can yield the minimal @xmath10 values .",
    "the general optimization is thus a two - part problem . since in the present study",
    "we are concerned with variations of adjustments starting in the same local minimum , we have employed only down - hill methods here .",
    "a variety of commercial and non - commercial optimization routines is available on the market .",
    "examples for downhill algorithms are simple grid searches , powell s conjugate - directions method , and levenberg - marquardt @xcite .",
    "the grid - search method , which in every iteration changes each parameter separately before comparing the new @xmath10 value with the previous one is quite inefficient due to large parameter correlations in these models ( for discussion of these correlations see subsection [ parameters ] ) .",
    "a better approach is powell s method , which starts out like a grid search but adjusts the directions in parameter space to optimize the down - hill motion .",
    "our experience is , however , that in the hilly @xmath10 hyper - surfaces this method often gets stuck and progresses very slowly .",
    "levenberg - marquardt combines the simple gradient descent with a parabolic expansion of the @xmath10 hyper - surface around the minimum .",
    "it dynamically switches between these two scenarios : far from the minimum , the gradient descent is preferable .",
    "closer to the minimum , where the gradient descent would only asymptotically reach the bottom , the parabolic expansion is used iteratively .",
    "an additional method , denoted as _ trial step _ , uses the information of already obtained @xmath10 values for a parabolic interpolation between them .",
    "the minimum of the parabola is the new guess for @xmath10 .",
    "based on previous @xcite and present experience @xcite , levenberg - marquardt plus the trial step in parameter space @xcite ( henceforth denoted as _ bevington curved step _ ) has been chosen here . but",
    "this algorithm needs to be restarted several times to reach the minimum in the @xmath10 hyper - surface .",
    "since the @xmath10 landscape of these models appears to resemble a hilly landscape , a combination of simulated annealing and diffusion monte - carlo @xcite has been tested in @xcite .",
    "this method found the region containing the parameter set pc - f1 , and bevington curved step led to the actual minimum containing pc - f1 .",
    "algorithms and techniques such as sa , ga , evolution strategies , and neural networks for the optimization of @xmath10 might become more important with the increasing complexity of nuclear density functionals .",
    "they could be used for the optimization of the coupling constants and/or the optimization of basis terms in the expansion of the energy functional .",
    "the task of parameter adjustment is simplified if the adjustment is initialized with realistic parameter values , i.e. , good first guesses .",
    "these initial values could be obtained from or related to more fundamental theories like qcd . in the future ,",
    "as the number of terms and observables increase , such information will become increasingly important .",
    "one guidance has emerged already : naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) or qcd scaling , which examines scaled coupling constants obtained from the original coupling constants by scaling them with the pion decay constant , @xmath13  mev , and the qcd mass scale , @xmath14  mev @xcite . these scaled and dimensionless",
    "coupling constants are called _ natural _ if they are of order 1 .",
    "so far , qcd scaling has worked well for recent sets of coupling constants with excellent predictive power @xcite .",
    "we expect that qcd scaling will provide further useful guidance for upcoming more detailed model development .",
    "a further connection between relativistic point - coupling models and qcd sum rules , the chiral condensate , and pion dynamics was drawn in refs . @xcite where the approximate values of the coupling constants are related to the physical properties of low - momentum qcd . yet ,",
    "due to truncated model spaces and other approximations , fine tuning will probably always be necessary to obtain optimal predictive power .",
    "the sets of observables and weights used for the adjustment of the rmf - fr force nl - z2 @xcite and the point - coupling force pc - f1 are shown in table [ nuc ] .",
    "these weights are based upon expectation and experience and constitute an average compromise between the actual measurement uncertainties and the requirement that the type of observable have a non - negligible influence in the @xmath10 minimization or adjustment procedure .",
    "the 0.2% weight on the experimental masses is greater than the corresponding experimental uncertainties of 1.2 @xmath15 10@xmath16  % ( average ) and the 0.5 % weight on the experimental mean square charge radii is greater than the corresponding experimental uncertainties of 0.17 % ( average ) .    due to this choice of weights ,",
    "the absolute value of @xmath10 or @xmath17 has only a relative meaning .",
    "however , the comparison of different @xmath10 values from various fits still indicates their relative goodness with respect to each other .",
    "there are further indications for the goodness of the fit , though .",
    "the @xmath17 of pc - f1 , for example , has a value of 2.75 , indicating that the model does not fulfill our expectations of performance reflected in our choice of weights .",
    "furthermore , the correlated errors of the coupling constants , which also depend on our choice of weights in the total @xmath10 , still deliver relative information on how well the various parameters have been determined .",
    "due to strong parameter correlations ( see subsection [ parameters ] ) these correlated errors range from 5 - 70 % and , in the worst cases , are larger than the value of the coupling constant , indicating that a readjustment without that parameter could , in principle , reach the same accuracy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "we have separately reduced the weights of the observables entering our total @xmath10 , keeping the remaining weights fixed , to test the sensitivity of @xmath10 with respect to their choices .",
    "a 50 % reduction of the weight for binding energy ( 0.2 % @xmath18 0.1 % ) , diffraction radius ( 0.5 % @xmath18 0.25 % ) , surface thickness ( 1.5 % @xmath18 0.75 % ) , and rms radius ( 0.5 % @xmath18 0.25 % ) leads to an increase of the total @xmath10 by factors of 2.9 , 1.4 , 1.2 , and 1.5 , respectively . the original total @xmath10 of pc - f1 is 99 .",
    "as expected , these factors are all greater than unity .",
    "the fact that they are ( approximately ) uniformly greater than unity indicates that ( approximately ) equal influence exists on the ( final ) interaction lagrangian for each of the four observable types .",
    "this was the goal in the choice of weights , but is by no means unique and , above all , the choice of weights is primarily subject to the constraints of the actual ( average ) experimental errors in the four observable types . repeating this exercise , but with a full parameter search for each of the four cases ,",
    "should lead to to the same conclusion as long as one remains in the same minimum on the @xmath10 hyper - surface .",
    "the set pc - f1 has been used as a basis for the majority of investigations in this study .",
    "it has been modified for several runs to test the sensitivity of the resultant force with respect to various choices of observables as well as weights .",
    "the nuclei chosen are either spherically magic or doubly - magic systems .",
    "these systems are reasonably good mean - field nuclei , where ground - state correlations play a minor role and they require minimal computational time .",
    "deformed nuclei increase the computational effort and require considerations of vibrational - rotational correlations , which are sometimes parametrized by phenomenological terms .",
    "however , these systems deliver additional information and hence will be considered in future relativistic mean - field model refinements , as has already been seen in non - relativistic skyrme - hartree - fock mass formulas @xcite .",
