    "the study of nuclear matter  hypothetical uniform infinite system of nucleons interacting via strong forces  has already been an important part of the nuclear physics development for several decades .",
    "it is a good starting point for both , nuclear physics of finite systems ( e.g. structure and properties of finite nuclei , dynamics of heavy - ion collisions ) and astrophysics ( e.g. structure and evolution of stars ) .",
    "the early attempts were based on the nonrelativistic brueckner  hartree ",
    "fock ( bhf ) theory ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for review and references therein ) , and related the bare nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) interaction to nuclear ground ",
    "state properties in a parameter  free way with a limited success .    the break  through was achieved when the relativistic extension of the bhf theory ( so called dirac  brueckner  hartree ",
    "fock ( dbhf ) approach ) was developed @xcite and successfully applied to nuclear matter problems .",
    "an essential feature of the dbhf is the incorporation of the relativistic dynamics , governed by the dirac equation with strong scalar and vector fields .",
    "the explicit treatment of the lower components of dirac spinors gives a rise to strongly density  dependent relativistic effects .",
    "they shift the nuclear matter saturation points ( `` coester band '' ) towards empirical values @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a great effort has been devoted to the successful dbhf description of both , symmetric and ( to lesser extent ) isospin  asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "thus , the dbhf approach is currently considered to be a microscopic parameter ",
    "free nuclear model based on realistic nn interaction .",
    "however , due to its complexity , this sophisticated approach is successfully manageable for nuclear matter properties only ; finite nuclei are at present beyond the scope of this model . to overcome this restriction ,",
    "several approaches were developed which relate the dbhf output for nuclear matter to the parameters of the relativistic mean  field ( rmf ) theory @xcite . the rmf approach is widely used and powerful phenomenological tool for various aspects of nuclear many ",
    "body problems which provides an effective framework for calculation of both , nuclear matter and ( contrary to dbhf ) also finite nuclei .",
    "the nonlinear rmf approach @xcite has already been proven to be a reliable tool for the calculation of normal nuclei close to the valley of stability @xcite , exotic and superheavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "now new experimental facilities are available to study properties of exotic nuclei with high isospin asymmetry .",
    "additionally , increasingly more precise observations and measurements of properties of neutron stars and supernovae have been carried out .",
    "this naturally brings a need for better description of isospin degree of freedom , which can be done by enhancing the isovector meson sector .",
    "the isovector scalar @xmath3 meson @xcite and vector cross - interactions @xcite were included into rmf for this purpose .",
    "the goal of this paper is obtaining of effective parametrization applied to asymmetric nuclear matter , using different degrees of freedom in order to study influence of @xmath3 meson and vector meson cross - interaction on quality of the reproduction of dbhf results , as well as their influence on calculated nuclear matter properties , especially on density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy .",

    "the first term together with the last two ones describe interaction of isoscalar and isovector mesons with nucleons where the strength of these interactions is determined by dimensionless coupling constants @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "negative values of the quartic selfinteraction constants are consequence of the fact , that dependence of symmetric scalar and vector potentials ensued from dbhf calculations on the baryon density is almost linear , which brings some difficulties into the determination of the selfinteraction force of isoscalar mesons , and thus results in negative and positive second derivative of vector and scalar potential , respectively .",
    "one of the explanations of this verity could be the fact , that the van - hove theorem @xcite is , unlike for the dbhf theory , fully consistent with the mean - field model only .",
    "the fit of lee _ et al .",

    "simultaneously with binding energies fit to the symmetric scalar and vector potentials ( fig  [ figure2 ] ) and also to above - mentioned proton and neutron scalar and vector potentials for proton fraction 0.125 ( fig  [ figure3 ] ) was performed .",

    "evaluation of @xmath2-@xmath1 cross - interaction influence on symmetry energy and its comparison with @xmath3 meson influence is possible from fig  [ figure4 ] .",
    "there it is drawn density dependence of the symmetry energy , where each of the lines is correspondent to different degrees of freedom used ( see table  [ table3 ] ) : ha contains both cross - interactions and @xmath3 meson contribution ; then inclusion of the @xmath3 meson without vector cross - interaction is accomplished by hb ; hc considers the vector cross - interaction but without @xmath3 meson , and finally basic model with @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons with their selfinteractions and @xmath2 mesons only ( hd ) .",
    "vector cross - interaction has significant impact on symmetry energy , where its influence has analogical nature as in the previous two data sets , thus supporting those results also in the case of @xmath3 meson inclusion .",
    "it increases growth of the symmetry energy in this case below approximately 0.13 @xmath66 , which is important for description of properties of exotic nuclei near the dripline and is similar as consequences of density dependence of the isovector couplings due to fock contributions , which was calculated in @xcite . above 0.13 @xmath66",
    "it slowers symmetry energy rise thus implicating an impact on higher density behavior of matter ( high energy beam collisions , supernovae explosions , neutron stars properties ) , and it is also in agreement with recent hartree calculations @xcite , where similar high - density influence of cross - interactions was concluded . in comparison",
    "@xmath3 meson contributes relatively slightly to behavior of symmetry energy - for lower and intermediate densities its contribution is almost inconspicuous thus not significantly affecting properties of atomic nuclei . for higher densities in absence of cross - interaction it slightly increases symmetry energy .",
    "also this result is in concordance with recent calculations of other authors @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of cross - interaction results beside strong curvature of symmetry energy also in contrary ( compared to previous case ) effect of @xmath3 meson - for higher densities it softly fortifies decrease of symmetry energy growth .",
    "this leads to conclusion , that @xmath2-@xmath1 cross - interactions seems to be an important degree of freedom which should be used in further calculations .",
    "in this work the relativistic mean field theory was used to obtain an effective parametrization of the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter calculated by more fundamental dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock theory .",
    "the energy per nucleon together with the symmetric isoscalar potentials were fitted , and simultaneously also proton and neutron scalar and vector potentials .",
    "isoscalar @xmath0 , @xmath1 mesons with their selfinteractions , and isovector @xmath2 , @xmath3 mesons with @xmath2-@xmath1 cross - interaction were used as degrees of freedom and parameters of the fit .",
    "generally a good reproduction of both the energy and the potentials was reached and thus the parameter sets are representing an effective dbhf description of asymmetric nuclear matter at normal baryon densities applicable as well for calculation of finite nuclei properties .",
    "the cross - interaction between @xmath2 and @xmath1 mesons turns out to improve reproduction of properties of asymmetric nuclear matter and additionally it increases symmetry energy in common nuclei density region , e.g. approximately bellow saturation density , and decreases this energy above saturation point , thus having consequences for properties of finite nuclei , especially with large isospin asymmetry , and also for description of nuclear matter at higher densities , relevant in high energy nuclear collisions and several astrophysical processes and phenomena ( e.g. neutron star properties and supernovae explosions ) .",
    "isovector @xmath3 meson also improves quality of the mean - field model , but without such a strong impact on density dependence of symmetry energy .",
    "this results imply that @xmath67 cross - interaction is very useful for better description of nuclear matter and that it could be important for calculations of properties of finite nuclei with high isospin asymmetry .",
