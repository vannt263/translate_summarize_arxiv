    "in the last years the enumerative geometry of straight lines on quartic surfaces in @xmath1 has been studied by many authors .    unlike smooth cubic surfaces , which always contain 27 lines",
    ", one can prove by a standard dimension count that a general quartic surface does not contain any line at all .",
    "one is therefore led to study the maximal number of lines that a quartic surface can contain .",
    "historically , the main focus has been on smooth complex quartic surfaces , which are well - known examples of algebraic k3 surfaces . in 1882",
    "f. schur  @xcite discovered a surface with 64 lines that now carries his name , given by the following equation @xmath2 the fact that 64 is indeed the highest number of lines that a smooth complex quartic surface can contain was proven by b. segre in 1943  @xcite . around 70 years later , though , s. rams and m. schtt  @xcite discovered a flaw in segre s argument and fixed his proof , extending it to smooth quartic surfaces defined over a field of characteristic different from 2 and 3 .    at the same time , a. degtyarev , i. itenberg and a. s. sertz  @xcite  spurred by a remark of w. barth  @xcite  were tackling the same problem using the theory of k3 surfaces and nikulin s theory of discriminant forms .",
    "their work resulted in a complete classification of large configurations of lines on smooth complex quartic surfaces up to projective equivalence .",
    "they also proved that schur s quartic is the only one containing 64 lines ( this holds not only over @xmath3 , but also over any field of characteristic different from 2 and 3 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "segre  rams ",
    "schtt s theorem was generalized by the author  @xcite to k3 quartic surfaces ",
    "i.e. , quartic surfaces containing at worst rational double points as singularities  defined over a field of characteristic different from 2 and 3 .",
    "the bound of 64 lines is still not known to be sharp for k3 quartic surfaces .",
    "degtyarev ( private communication ) has proven the existence of a complex k3 quartic surface with 52 lines and 2 singular points of type @xmath4 , whose equation is not known .",
    "non - k3 complex quartic surfaces have been studied by gonzlez alonso and rams  @xcite .",
    "if they are not ruled by lines , they can contain at most 48 lines .",
    "they also conjecture that the actual bound is 31 .    given a line @xmath5 on a k3 quartic surface @xmath0 , the pencil of planes in @xmath1 containing @xmath5",
    "induces a genus  1 fibration on the minimal desingularization of @xmath0 , i.e. an elliptic or a quasi - elliptic fibration : the latter case can only appear in characteristic 2 and 3 , by a theorem of j. tate  @xcite .",
    "heuristically , quasi - elliptic fibrations can carry a higher number of fiber components than elliptic fibrations , thus allowing for a higher number of lines on @xmath0 .",
    "in characteristic 2 , @xmath0 can contain at most 68 lines  @xcite .",
    "moreover , if @xmath0 contains 68 lines , then @xmath0 is projectively equivalent to a member of a certain 1-dimensional family discovered by rams and schtt .",
    "on the other hand , the genus  1 fibration induced by a line @xmath5 can be quasi - elliptic only if @xmath5 contains a singular point .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is smooth , then the fibration is always elliptic .",
    "this fact was proven by rams and schtt in  @xcite , where they also exhibited a smooth surface with 60 lines .",
    "degtyarev  @xcite subsequently proved that 60 is indeed the maximum possible .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with k3 quartic surfaces defined over a field of characteristic 3 .",
    "the fermat quartic surface defined by @xmath6 contains 112 lines ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : char3 ] if @xmath0 is a k3 quartic surface defined over a field of characteristic  @xmath7 , then @xmath0 contains @xmath8 lines or at most @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath0 contains @xmath8 lines , then @xmath0 is projectively equivalent to the fermat quartic surface .",
    "this theorem extends a similar result by rams and schtt  @xcite on smooth quartic surfaces .",
    "the bound of 67 lines is not known to be sharp .",
    "degtyarev  @xcite has proven a bound of 60 lines for smooth quartic surfaces not projectively equivalent to the fermat quartic surface , which is not known to be sharp either .",
    "the number 60 , though , could only be attained by a non - supersingular surface .",
    "he also showed that smooth supersingular quartic surfaces have 112 lines or at most 58 , and that there are three different possible configurations of 58 lines . in examples [ ex:58 - 1st - conf ] , [ ex:58 - 2nd - conf ] and [ ex:58 - 3rd - conf ]",
    "we provide explicit equations of three 1-dimensional families of smooth quartic surfaces containing these configurations .",
    "the first and second families had already been found also by degtyarev , while the third one is new , to our knowledge .",
    "the three families were found while examining the proof of proposition  [ prop : star ] ( for the third one , also taking advantage of degtyarev s explicit configuration of lines , which was communicated to us by email ) , which states that if @xmath0 contains a star , i.e. , four ( coplanar ) lines intersecting at a smooth point , then @xmath0 contains at most 58 lines .",
    "this provides evidence for the following conjecture .    a k3 quartic surfaces defined over a field of characteristic  @xmath7 contains @xmath8 lines or at most @xmath10 .",
    "the bound of 67 lines could possibly be improved by distinguishing between supersingular and non - supersingular k3 quartic surfaces . for the former",
    ", a deep lattice - theoretical analysis seems necessary . for the latter ,",
    "our geometrical approach could probably lead to a bound of 64 lines .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",

    " [ sec : char3-elliptic ] : :    we study elliptic lines .",
