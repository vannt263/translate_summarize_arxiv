    "the vacuum schwarzschild ( schd ) solution of general relativity suffers from a singularity at @xmath1 , but perhaps a more meaningful observation is that the schd solution can not be trusted in a finite region enclosing the origin . at a nonzero radius inside the horizon",
    "a curvature invariant has grown as large as the planck mass scale , at which point the einstein action should no longer provide the correct description .",
    "for example in the standard schd coordinate system @xmath2 , and thus the schd solution breaks down at a radius of order @xmath3 . for large @xmath4",
    "this is much smaller than the horizon size @xmath5 , but it is much larger than the planck length @xmath6 .    there have been discussions within general relativity on how the diverging curvatures can be tamed @xcite . if a suitable matter distribution is postulated and allowed to violate the strong energy condition , then nonsingular black - hole - like solutions do arise .",
    "although the curvatures in the core region are now finite they are still characterized by the planck scale , and thus the einstein action can only provide a crude description .",
    "but an interesting aspect of such solutions is the appearance of a second horizon , in the vicinity of @xmath7 .",
    "no matter what the theory is or what matter is present , it appears that nonsingular spherically symmetric static solutions can never have only one horizon . in the standard coordinate system",
    "the metric of interest is @xmath8 if the curvature invariants @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ... are to be nonsingular at the origin , what does this imply about the behavior of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ? for small @xmath0 we find that and @xmath13 near the origin and a variety of curvature invariants , similar to our scan for solutions in next section . ]",
    "@xmath14 in this case @xmath15 at @xmath1 and the higher invariants are polynomials in @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "( the constant @xmath18 is affected by a rescaling of @xmath19 and can be ignored . )",
    "the important point is that @xmath20 is fixed to be unity .",
    "but inside the horizon of the schd solution @xmath12 is negative , a fact directly connected with the existence of the schd horizon where the signs of @xmath12 and @xmath13 change .",
    "then to match onto a nonsingular solution with @xmath21 another sign change is required . to preserve a time - like direction @xmath13",
    "must also change sign again .",
    "thus @xmath12 and @xmath13 must each have an even number of sign changes between @xmath1 and @xmath22 , rather than the single sign change implied by a single horizon .",
    "given this result , a theory of gravity capable of describing planck scale physics should address the following three questions .",
    "are these metrics that describe large but nonsingular curvatures near the origin actually solutions to the theory ?",
    "do solutions that are singular at the origin continue to be present , or are they banished altogether ? how does a nonsingular solution at the origin match onto a sensible solution at large @xmath0 while experiencing an even number of sign changes , without encountering a singularity at a finite @xmath0 ?",
    "to model planck scale physics we consider theories where the einstein action is extended to include terms with more factors of the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives .",
    "we will explicitly study spherically symmetric static solutions of these higher derivative theories truncated at various orders in derivatives .",
    "in particular we will construct solutions as a series expansion about the origin for theories with 6 , 8 and even 10 derivatives . and for the general theory truncated at four derivatives we will be able to construct numerical solutions that interpolate between the small curvature , weak gravity behavior at large @xmath0 and the high curvature , strong gravity behavior at small @xmath0 .",
    "some aspects of our results may be true at any order in the derivative expansion .    in the @xmath23 derivative theory ( the theory with the einstein term and the general set of 4 derivative terms ) the schd solution is still present .",
    "@xcite applied the series expansion approach to this theory to find , in addition to the schd solution , another class of singular solutions and a class of nonsingular solutions .",
    "but it was not known which , if any , of these alternative solutions near the origin could match onto the desired weak gravity solution at large @xmath0 .",
    "our numerical work shall clarify these issues .",
    "although the @xmath23 derivative theory has a variety of solutions near the origin , we find that only one class of solutions remains for the typical action with more derivatives .",
    "this turns out to be the nonsingular class of solutions , having the expected property @xmath21 .",
    "such solutions are found for any action considered .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that nonsingular solutions exist , since spherically symmetric static solutions that are everywhere weak , produced for example by a low density matter distribution , must be recovered .",
    "more surprising is that _ singular _ solutions , if they exist at all , only exist for very particular actions , of measure zero in the space of theories .",
    "( among these very particular theories are those that have received some attention .",
    "for example the schd solution continues to exist in theories where only powers of the curvature scalar @xmath9 appear in the action @xcite . )",
    "this is not to say that solutions with singularities do nt exist ; the typical unphysical solution would involve a curvature singularity at a finite @xmath0 .",
    "but to find nonsingular black - hole - like solutions our previous discussion indicates that we must search for solutions with several sign flips .",
    "this appears difficult to accomplish in higher derivative theories , either analytically or numerically , and it is not the focus of this work .",
    "rather we shall be more concerned with how a core region of strong gravity matches onto a weak gravity large @xmath0 region without any change of sign of metric components , and thus with no horizons .    before launching into the study of these solutions ,",
    "it is natural to question the derivative expansion itself .",
    "of course a derivative expansion truncated at some finite order has problems with physical interpretation ; in particular it suffers from negative energy ghost modes when linearized .",
    "but this problem is entangled with the effects of truncation and linearization ; it is not fundamental in the sense that the underlying theory , from which the derivative expansion is derived , should be quite sensible .",
    "evidence of the role of nonlinearities in resolving the ghost problem was found for a different class of metrics of frw form in @xcite , where ghost modes were found to decouple from positive energy matter when the nonlinear solutions were considered . in any case",
    "results that hold at arbitrary order in the nonlinear derivative expansion , such as the existence of nonsingular solutions near the origin as described above , would appear to carry some significance .",
    "the solutions near the origin and their implications are discussed in more detail in the next section . in sections 3 and 4 we turn to the general @xmath23 derivative theory and",
    "numerically analyze the non - schd solutions that are respectively singular and nonsingular near the origin .",
    "we show how these solutions match onto the desired weak gravity solutions at large @xmath0 , and in particular that they do so without encountering horizons . in section 5",
    "we turn to the de sitter space , which in static coordinates also has a horizon at a finite radius .",
    "here we again explore the idea that the horizon is replaced by a boundary where a transition from weak to strong gravity occurs ; now the picture is inside - out with weak ( strong ) gravity on the inside ( outside ) .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "we consider a general gravitational action with any number of derivatives .",
    "the field equations @xmath24 determining @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be found by substituting the metric ( [ met ] ) into the action and varying with respect to @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; this gives @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "@xmath27 can then be found from the bianchi identity @xcite , @xmath28 we first look for nonsingular solutions in the presence of a smooth matter distribution with finite energy and pressure .",
    "for our purposes we define nonsingular metrics as those without curvature singularities , and we have already said that such metrics must have @xmath21 .",
    "it is interesting to see how this emerges as a property of solutions to the field equations .",
    "when @xmath20 and @xmath29 are nonzero and finite the leading terms in the field equations for small @xmath0 behave like @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the maximum number of derivatives in the action .",
    "this behavior arises from the terms with no derivatives of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which nevertheless arise from @xmath31 derivative terms in the action .",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath30 term in each equation is proportional to a polynomial in @xmath20 , and these polynomials vanish iff @xmath21 .",
    "this result is thus intrinsically connected with the nonlinearity of the theory .",
    "all the terms behaving like inverse powers of @xmath0 in the equations must vanish , and this leads to solutions of the form @xmath32 we find that solutions of this form exist for general actions , and we have tested actions up to 10 derivatives . @xmath16 and @xmath17 are free parameters of these solutions and all the higher order coefficients are determined by them and by the matter distribution . if we assume the presence of a spherically symmetric matter distribution described by the energy and pressure profiles @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and if an equation of state is specified , then we find that the series expansions of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are completely determined in terms of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath35 . in this sense",
    "this is a 3 parameter family of solutions .",
    "this holds for general actions except for isolated points in theory space ; one such exception is general relativity , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are directly determined by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we now consider the possibility of singular solutions . to find other solutions near the origin we look for other cases where the leading terms in the @xmath37 expansion of the field equations vanish for special choices of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 expansion parameters , @xmath38 note that both the leading and next - to - leading parameters can appear in the leading terms in the field equations .",
    "if such a case is found then the expansion can be tested as a solution at higher orders . since various powers of @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "appear in the nonlinear field equations it would seem miraculous to find solutions with @xmath41 and @xmath42 noninteger ; in any case we have restricted the search to integer @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "our search is also blind to solutions that are not amenable to a series expansion at the origin .",
    "we have performed a scan through a range of values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 for a range of actions . in the case of the general @xmath23 derivative theory",
    "the scan yields the three sets of solutions found in @xcite : the nonsingular solutions in ( [ e4 ] ) with @xmath43 , the schd solution with @xmath44 , and another set of singular solutions to be described below with @xmath45 . for actions with more derivatives",
    "only the nonsingular solutions remain , except for specialized actions where various terms are set arbitrarily to zero .",
    "the result then is that the static spherically symmetric solutions of a typical high derivative theory are not singular at the origin",
    ". if singularities occur , they occur at a nonzero radius .",
    "we stress again that the schd solution is a generic solution only in theories truncated at two derivatives ( general relativity ) or four derivatives . in typical theories with six or more derivatives",
    "the schd solution will remain only as an approximate weak gravity solution in the large @xmath0 region where the einstein term dominates .",
    "in fact by examining a series expansion in @xmath37 of the field equations around the schd solution one finds ( see also @xcite ) that the corrections have the form , @xmath46 once again we see that the schd solution is a good approximation to an exact solution down to a radius well within the horizon , implying that @xmath12 and @xmath13 would have to change sign a second time if they were to match onto ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "when the exact solution is extended in towards the origin one must encounter a second horizon and/or a singularity at a finite radius .",
    "is negative , since a nonsingular negative energy solution would imply that minkowski space is not stable @xcite . ]",
    "but there is a loophole in these arguments , related to the observation that an exact solution of the form in ( [ e8 ] ) is not the unique solution in the weak gravity region @xcite . as discussed in the next section",
    ", there are other solutions involving the massive modes in the theory , giving rise to solutions involving terms of the yukawa potential type .",
    "thus the real question is what happens when a more general exterior solution , which is newtonian plus yukawa in form at large @xmath0 , is continued in towards @xmath1 .    to shed light on these issues",
    "it would be best to make a direct analysis of a theory with six or more derivatives , where the only solutions are nonsingular at the origin .",
    "but the complexity of those equations will constrain our present work to a numerical study of the @xmath23 derivative theory .",
    "we will investigate how the various solutions existing near the origin of the @xmath23 derivative theory join onto the weak - gravity large-@xmath0 solutions .",
    "we are once again dealing with solutions of truncated theory in a region where the truncated theory is not justified , but it will be of interest to compare and contrast these solutions to the schd solution .",
    "the action of the general @xmath23 derivative theory can be cast in the form @xmath47 we first consider the _ linearized _ version of this theory , where the equations for @xmath12 and @xmath13 have five independent solutions @xcite . for a weak constraint on @xmath48 and @xmath18 , assumed here to be satisfied ,",
    "four of the solutions have exponential dependence .",
    "the two that grow exponentially with @xmath0 are discarded to satisfy boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "this leaves the newtonian solution and two solutions that resemble yukawa potentials . for",
    "any physical matter distribution the yukawa potential terms will coexist with the newtonian term in the exterior solution ( an example is given in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the yukawa potential terms has a repulsive sign , reflecting the ghost - like nature of the massive mode .",
    "the yukawa potentials are typically swamped by the newtonian term and offer little chance of detection in weak gravity solutions @xcite .    on the other hand the mere existence of the yukawa potential terms for some matter distribution",
    "for which linearized gravity is applicable proves that the exact schd solution of the full @xmath23 derivative theory is not the true exterior solution @xcite .",
    "there is also no reason to expect it to be the relevant solution when there is sufficient matter density to cause the schd horizon to form .",
    "we must study other exact solutions of the theory that take a newtonian plus yukawa form in the exterior region .",
    "such solutions can be markedly different from the schd solution in the interior region .",
    "in particular the region of high curvature and strong gravity can be larger than in the schd solution .",
    "the idea that a region of planck scale curvature can be of macroscopic size is not conceptually new since , as described in the introduction , this is already is implied by the schd solution .",
    "if strong gravity extends out to nearly the radius of the would - be schd horizon , then @xmath12 and @xmath13 could retain their weak gravity signs for all @xmath0 , and a horizon need not exist .",
    "this possibility turns out to be illustrated by the other class of solutions in the @xmath23 derivative theory that are singular near the origin .",
    "close to the origin they have the form @xmath49 we shall be concerned with @xmath50 , where @xmath17 is sensitive to a rescaling of @xmath19 . the existence of these solutions up to @xmath51 was shown in @xcite . we have found that these are 5 parameter solutions where the parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) determine ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) for @xmath58 , for a given action .",
    "the leading behavior of the curvature invariants [ @xmath9 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 is [ @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , to be compared with [ 0 , 0 , @xmath64 for the schd solution .",
    "we note here that any nonsingular mass distribution only affects ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) for @xmath65 .",
    "it is an interesting coincidence that there are five parameters here , just as in the linearized gravity solutions .",
    "this lends support to the idea that full solutions exist which join together the strong gravity small @xmath0 solutions with the weak gravity large @xmath0 solutions .",
    "a numerical verification is made somewhat difficult by the existence of exponentially growing solutions at large @xmath0 , and by the extremely singular behavior of the equations at small @xmath0 away from the exact solutions .",
    "in particular , a numerical analysis based on the initial value problem at @xmath1 is not feasible . instead the following strategy was adopted .    at some finite @xmath66 in the _ weak _ gravity region",
    "initial conditions are chosen so as to deviate only very slightly from the schd solution , and the equations are numerically integrated for @xmath0 both larger and smaller than @xmath66 .",
    "the yukawa potential modes are induced and they grow for decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "this can cause the solution to deviate significantly from the schd solution around the would - be horizon region , and rather than changing sign , both @xmath12 and @xmath13 can stay finite and positive throughout this region and down to @xmath1 . the initial conditions at @xmath66 are then finely tuned so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 near @xmath1 take the form of the known solution in ( [ e2 ] ) to @xmath67 .",
    "additional fine tuning is needed to remove the unwanted modes that grow exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "but it is easier just to repeat the whole process for a larger @xmath66 where the required deviation from the schd solution is smaller ; then the amplitude of the unwanted modes is smaller and a sensible numerical solution extends out to larger @xmath0 .",
    "it appears that the extent to which one can push this is a purely numerical limitation , and that these numerical results are sufficient to demonstrate the existence of exact solutions of this type .",
    "derivative theory with no horizon and a singularity at the origin , which matches onto the schd solution with @xmath68 close to its horizon at @xmath69 ( in units with @xmath70 ) . @xmath12 and",

    "( [ f1 ] ) , where we plot the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "these functions coincide ( after a suitable rescaling of @xmath19 ) with each other and with the schd solution in the weak gravity region , exterior to the would - be horizon .",
    "we have chosen @xmath74 and @xmath75 in ( [ e1 ] ) to simplify the equations somewhat ( corresponding , in the linearized theory , to equal masses for the two massive modes ) , but the basic properties of the solutions are independent of this choice .",
    "the mass @xmath76 as deduced by the large @xmath0 behavior in this example is @xmath77 .",
    "larger @xmath76 has also been considered and there does not seem to be any limitation , other than numerical , to recover arbitrarily large mass solutions .",
    "the new solutions have no horizon and a singularity at the origin .",
    "their interior form , and the point where deviation from the schd solution occurs , is not uniquely determined by @xmath76 .",
    "this is as expected given the additional parameters governing the strength of the yukawa potentials in the exterior solution , and the five parameters in ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "we also find that @xmath78 , which is consistent with the curvature invariant @xmath79 being of planck size close to the would - be horizon , even for a large mass object .",
    "of course this is how the usual arguments for the existence of a horizon are avoided , since the uniqueness of the schd solution relies on small curvatures and the applicability of general relativity down to radii well within the horizon .",
    "this solution is intriguing , but it is occurring in a theory arbitrarily truncated in derivatives , and the solution involves a region of high curvature where higher derivative terms would be important . on the other hand",
    "the schd solution suffers from exactly the same problems . as in that case",
    "one may want to presume that the higher derivative terms being ignored would serve to smooth out the singularity at the origin while retaining the main qualitative feature , the fact that the transition between weak and strong gravity has moved out to the would - be horizon radius .",
    "we shall now turn to the nonsingular solutions of the @xmath23 derivative theory , where additional insights will emerge .",
    "a spherically symmetric nonsingular matter distribution will act as a source for these solutions .",
    "we choose to study incompressible matter , where @xmath33 will be given a fixed profile and the theory will determine the required pressure @xmath34 .",
    "in particular we take @xmath80 .",
    "derivative theory for the smooth mass distribution with @xmath81 and @xmath82 in planck units .",

    "thus far we are only successful by taking @xmath83 of order the planck length @xmath6 , but this seems to be purely a limitation of the numerical strategy which we now describe . noting that equations can not be directly integrated from @xmath1 , we use the series expansion in ( [ e4 ] ) to @xmath84 and express all coefficients in terms of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this is used to provide the initial conditions for the differential equations at a small finite value of @xmath0 , where the series solution can be trusted .",
    "the equations can then be numerically integrated out from this point to large @xmath0 . for a given @xmath86 , a tedious search of the ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath85 ) parameter space",
    "is then needed to match onto the weak gravity exterior solution , with the additional constraint that @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "we display one of these solutions in fig .",

    "the whole notion of gravitational collapse is based on this basic behavior , but we find a qualitatively different behavior in the @xmath23 derivative theory .",

    "the higher derivative terms are acting to reduce the tendency to collapse , and @xmath85 is still finite at the particular mass that first causes infinite @xmath85 in gr .",
    "@xmath85 continues to increase for increasing @xmath4 until the strong gravity effects cause a peculiar phenomenon ; a maximum value @xmath97 occurs at a finite @xmath85 .",
    "after this point @xmath85 continues to increase while @xmath4 _ decreases _ !    connected with this behavior is the fact that , unlike gr , the physical mass @xmath98 of the object as deduced by the exterior solution is not the same as @xmath4 , the volume integral of @xmath33 . from fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) we see that @xmath99 is smaller than @xmath4 for small @xmath85 , while the reverse happens for sufficiently large @xmath85 . in the latter case",
    "strong gravity contributions are responsible for an increasing fraction of the total @xmath99 , which decreases much less rapidly than @xmath4 for increasing @xmath85 .",
    "we note that the maximum value @xmath97 is achieved when the scalar curvature @xmath9 at the origin switches sign , being positive ( negative ) on the low ( high ) pressure side of @xmath97 .",
    "the example in fig .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) corresponds to @xmath100 .",
    "even though the @xmath92 curve in fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) is derived for an incompressible material , it has implications for massive objects with more physical equations of state . for the more standard part of the curve where @xmath85 is growing with @xmath86 ( remember @xmath101 )",
    ", @xmath102 is also growing .",
    "thus when more matter is added to a given volume the object may or may not be able to support the required increase in pressure , depending on its equation of state .",
    "if not , gravitational collapse ensues .",
    "on the other part of the curve , @xmath85 _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath86 . thus adding more matter to a given volume will tend to decrease the required pressure , and the required @xmath102 decreases even more .",
    "then the matter exerts too much pressure and the object will tend to expand in size rather than contract .",
    "thus the usual tendency for gravitational collapse is absent on this part of the curve .",
    "the crossover between the two types of behavior occurs at the value of @xmath102 at @xmath97 ; for our example with @xmath89 this is 0.39 .",
    "it remains to be checked whether this basic picture survives for much larger @xmath83 .",
    "the question is whether a @xmath92 curve corresponding to a larger volume , which would lie above the one in fig .",
    "( [ f3 ] ) , has the same general shape .",
    "but our present numerical approach is not powerful enough to deal with this question .",
    "finally , the concept of a maximum mass at a finite pressure leads to the following question .",
    "suppose we start with the maximum mass configuration ; what happens if the mass in the fixed volume is increased still further ?",
    "as in general relativity , we may expect that a curvature singularity should develop at the origin .",
    "if so then the solution should transform into one of the solutions of the previous section ; we have already mentioned that the presence of a nonsingular mass distribution would only affect those solutions at order @xmath103 . by continuity",
    "it seems appropriate that the new configuration would maintain a finite @xmath85 . in this way",
    "it appears that the `` maximum mass at finite pressure '' property of the nonsingular solution is related to the existence of the singular class of solutions . unlike general relativity , the transition from a nonsingular solution to a singular one does not lead to the appearance of a horizon .",
    "then what happens when there are 6 or more derivatives in the action , and there are no singular solutions at the origin .",
    "does this imply that the maximum mass of the @xmath92 curve extends out to infinite @xmath4 ? this would be the most intriguing possibility ; the only nonsingular alternative to the horizon - free solutions discussed here is the possibility of solutions with at least two horizons .",
    "another horizon of physical interest occurs in the de sitter metric , which in the static coordinate system has @xmath104 the physical region is interior to the horizon at @xmath105 and for small cosmological constant it is a weak gravity , small curvature region with @xmath106 .",
    "but we may wonder whether the weak gravity region can border on a strong gravity region in such a way that there is no horizon , with the border being roughly the location of the would - be horizon .",
    "we will find that actions containing terms with six or more derivatives are necessary to deal with this question .",
    "thus we must rely less on numerical analysis and more on series expansions , both in the weak and strong gravity regions .",
    "we find results that are consistent with the idea of horizon elimination .",
    "first we note that the de sitter metric when expanded about the origin is a member of the nonsingular class of solutions in ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "we are interested in other solutions of this class where the scalar curvature @xmath9 is close to being constant , departing significantly from @xmath107 only when the would - be horizon is approached .",
    "we can write such solutions to theories with a cosmological constant and no matter in the form @xmath108 the parameter @xmath109 characterizes the deviation from the de sitter metric .",
    "the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 vanish with @xmath109 and they also depend on @xmath112 and the action being considered .    for the @xmath23 derivative action we find that solutions with a nonzero @xmath109 do not in fact produce a departure of @xmath9 from @xmath107 .",
    "actions with more derivatives are required for this to happen ; in addition such actions cause the @xmath112 in ( [ e10 ] ) to shift by an amount of order @xmath113 from the cosmological constant in the action .",
    "when this is taken into account we find that an @xmath109 expansion gives@xmath114 @xmath115 has a nonvanishing @xmath116 limit and @xmath117 . by taking @xmath109 appropriately small",
    "we can suppose that @xmath118 will remain small until @xmath0 approaches the would - be horizon .",
    "numerically we find that @xmath109 has to be exponentially small ; this is reminiscent of the exponentially small departure from the schd solution in the exterior region discussed in the previous sections .    to explore the large @xmath0 strong gravity region",
    "we expand the equations in powers of @xmath37 .",
    "we find a new one - parameter family of solutions that can only arise when six or more derivative terms appear in the action .",
    "these new solutions are typically a corrected form of the anti - de - sitter - schd metric , since pure ads - schd solutions only occur for specialized actions . the appearance of corrections are not unexpected given the corrected schd metric in ( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "the leading corrections are deduced by solving the equations to the appropriate order in @xmath37 , and we find @xmath119 these are strong gravity solutions since the positive @xmath120 is fixed by the theory to be planckian in size , @xmath121 .",
    "the dimensionless @xmath122 and @xmath123 constants are also determined by the action being considered , whereas @xmath4 is the free parameter .",
    "if the corrections were absent then the scalar curvature would be @xmath124 and there would be a horizon at @xmath125 for large @xmath4 .",
    "but at large @xmath0 the corrections modify the scalar curvature as follows , @xmath126 thus in the vicinity of the would - be horizon the departures from the pure ads - schd metric are becoming large , and so what actually happens there is not known . note that this modification of the horizon region has emerged automatically from the general solution .",
    "the one parameter @xmath4 can then be adjusted so that the radius of this would - be horizon is in the vicinity of the would - be horizon of the weak gravity interior solution . in both the interior and exterior regions @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive , and so the matching of solutions can occur without a horizon .",
    "these results are of course not sufficient to prove the existence of an exact solution that joins together the small and large @xmath0 behaviors we have described , but the results are consistent with such a solution .",
    "a numerical analysis of this horizon - free possibility remains to be performed .",
    "the resulting picture is of a large mass object in a strong ads - space that has as its interior a weak ds - space .",
    "the `` mass of the universe '' @xmath127 is enormous , since it is of order a planckian mass density times the volume of the interior space .",
    "we have studied static spherically symmetric solutions of higher derivative gravity , and have found that when there are six or more derivatives the solutions are typically nonsingular near the origin .",
    "but the nature of these solutions implies that the complete solutions with newtonian large @xmath0 behavior must have an even number of horizons .",
    "our study of @xmath23 derivative gravity provides some insights into how a solution with a strong gravity core region can realize the zero horizon option .",
    "the region of strong gravity extends out to the radius of the would - be horizon , which then negates the usual arguments for the existence of a horizon .",
    "we exhibited horizon - free solutions of this type that were singular at the origin .",
    "it remains to show how this picture persists in the higher derivative theories where solutions are always nonsingular at the origin .",
    "we also discussed some unexpected properties of nonsingular solutions in @xmath23 derivative gravity that affect the inevitability of gravitation collapse .",
    "a high pressure accumulation of matter can have the property that increasing energy density corresponds to decreasing pressure . associated with this",
    "is a maximum for the amount of matter in the given volume .",
    "this sounds familiar , but in this case horizons and black holes play no role .",
    "rather , the maximum mass configuration corresponds to a particular finite pressure at the origin , and this configuration can be approached from both the low pressure and high pressure sides .",
    "numerical limitations confined our study of this phenomena to planck mass objects , and so it remains to extend this picture to much larger masses .",
    "it could be expected that strong gravity and higher derivatives would help to resolve singularities .",
    "but we have seen that a transition region from weak to strong gravity can also take the place of a horizon .",
    "of most interest are solutions that are nonsingular and same - sign everywhere ; such solutions have to be investigated in theories with six or more derivatives to see whether they exist for smooth mass distributions of arbitrary energy density .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that theories with six or more derivatives are necessary to describe the possible elimination of the de sitter horizon . in both the schd and de sitter cases the deviations in the weak gravity regions are exponentially small until the would - be horizon is reached .",
    "it remains to be seen whether regions of strong gravity can be intruding on our weak gravity universe .",
