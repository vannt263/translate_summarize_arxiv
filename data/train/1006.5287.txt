    "quantum dimer models have emerged as one of the main paradigms in the investigation of quantum spin liquids .",
    "the rokhsar - kivelson ( rk ) quantum dimer model ( qdm ) , which includes a potential interaction of amplitude @xmath1 between dimers facing each other and a kinetic term of amplitude @xmath2 flipping them around rhombic plaquettes , has recently attracted special attention .",
    "the main reason comes from the presence on the triangular lattice of a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) phase first discovered by moessner and sondhi@xcite and extensively studied since then using zero temperature green s function quantum monte carlo ( gfqmc).@xcite exact results have been obtained at the rk point ( @xmath3 ) , where the sum of all configurations can be proven to be a ground state , @xcite and at @xmath4 , where the non - flippable configurations are the ground states .",
    "analytical results have also been obtained in the limit @xmath5 , where columnar states have been shown to be selected . however , in the intermediate range below the rk point , most of what is known about the model is based on numerical simulations .    a closely related model for which a number of analytical results have already been obtained is the fully frustrated transverse field ising model ( fftfim ) on the honeycomb lattice defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transverse magnetic field , @xmath8 is the coupling constant of the ising interaction term , @xmath9 denotes pairs of nearest neighbors on the honeycomb lattice , and @xmath10 is such that for each hexagon of the lattice the number of antiferromagnetic bonds ( @xmath11 ) is odd , different choices of @xmath12 corresponding to the same model up to the rotation of some spins by @xmath13 around the @xmath14 axis@xcite .",
    "transverse field ising models have been the subject of intense investigations over the years .",
    "@xcite the relationship between the fftfim on a regular lattice and the qdm on the dual lattice has been first emphasized by moessner , sondhi and chandra@xcite who showed ( see also ref .",
    "1 ) that , in the limit @xmath15 , the fftfim on the honeycomb lattice maps onto the qdm on the triangular lattice with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for the fftfim on the honeycomb lattice",
    ", they also carried out a landau - ginzburg analysis and identified four soft modes which , upon lowering @xmath18 , simultaneously become gapless , leading to a surprisingly large unit cell of 48 sites .",
    "details of this calculation have been reported later by moessner and sondhi in ref .  .",
    "these authors further conjectured that the translational symmetry breaking transition out of the paramagnetic phase coming from large @xmath18 provides a reasonable description of the transition between the rvb phase and the intermediate phase of the qdm on the triangular lattice.@xcite    building on this conjecture , misguich and one of the present authors have carried out a semiclassical investigation of the paramagnetic phase of the fftfim on the honeycomb lattice@xcite and have shown that the dispersion of the spin waves and their softening at the transition are in remarkable agreement with the dispersion of visons in the qdm on the triangular lattice and their crystallization transition as revealed by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations.@xcite however , the analysis of ref .    in the present paper , we perform a systematic investigation of the fftfim on the honeycomb lattice in the complete parameter range @xmath19 with classical and semi - classical approximations . as we shall see , the classical phase diagram is much richer than expected , with an infinite number of different crystalline phases below the paramagnetic phase : a plaquette phase , a cascade of mixed phases , and a highly degenerate columnar phase .",
    "quantum fluctuations have been treated within linear spin - wave theory , leading to a partial lifting of the degeneracy of the columnar phase , and to an increase of the size of the region occupied by the plaquette phase .    to make contact between the physics of the fftfim and of the qdm ,",
    "it is useful to introduce a gauge theory defined on the triangular lattice by the hamiltonian : @xmath20 where @xmath21 runs over the sites of the dual honeycomb lattice , and @xmath22 are the three bonds forming the triangular plaquette around site @xmath21 . as shown by moessner , sondhi and fradkin,@xcite the fftfim is equivalent , up to a twofold degeneracy , to the odd sector of this gauge theory defined by @xmath23 } \\tau^x_{l[a]}=-1\\,,\\vspace*{-2mm}\\ ] ] for all @xmath24 , where @xmath24 is a site of the triangular lattice , and the product over @xmath25 $ ] runs over the six links emanating from @xmath24 . for a compact discussion of the correspondence between the three models ,",
    "see e.g. the introduction of ref .  .",
    ") are shown by zigzags , all other bonds being ferromagnetic ( with @xmath26).,width=188 ]    the discussion of the ordered phases is simpler in the context of the gauge theory .",
    "indeed , in the fftfim language , the actual orientation of the spins in a given state depends on the choice of the matrix @xmath12 .",
    "by contrast , the dimer operator of the gauge theory defined by @xmath27 translates into @xmath28 in the ising language , and its expectation value does not depend on the choice of @xmath12 .",
    "another advantage of the gauge - invariant language is that it allows to make a direct comparison with the numerical results obtained on the qdm since they live on the same lattice and are defined in terms of the same link operators .",
    "so , while all reasonings and calculations will be performed in the context of the fftfim , the only formulation adapted to the semiclassical approach , the structures of different ordered phases will be also described in gauge - invariant terms . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use only gauges in which each hexagon of the lattice contains exactly one antiferromagnetic bond ( with @xmath11 ) and five ferromagnetic bonds ( with @xmath26 ) .",
    "most results will be presented for the simplest periodic arrangement of the antiferromagnetic bonds shown in fig.[fig : choice of gauge ] . however",
    ", this choice of gauge does not always lead to the smallest possible unit cell in terms of the spin representation .",
    "thus , we will also introduce other gauges whenever this is helpful .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we concentrate on the limit @xmath29 , which has not been considered in refs . , and we show that columnar phases reminiscent of the @xmath30 limit of the qdm are stabilized . in section iii , we revisit the vicinity of the rvb phase .",
    "we recover the symmetry predicted by the landau - ginzburg approach of refs .   and by the spin - wave analysis of ref .",
    ", but we find that the bonds with the largest dimer density form separate 4-site rhombic plaquettes instead of having a uniform distribution inside a 12-site unit cell as reported in ref .  .",
    "the reasons for this discrepancy are explained in subsection [ appendix : difference plaquette and misguich phases ] . in section iv , we discuss the transition between the plaquette phase and the columnar phase and show that they are separated by a region of intermediate phases of mixed character .",
    "the stability of these phases with respect to quantum fluctuations and the semi - classical phase diagram are discussed in section v. the paper ends with a short conclusion in section vi .",
    "in this section we discuss the properties of the model when @xmath18 is small . the argument proceeds in three steps .",
    "first we determine the ground state manifold of the heisenberg model with purely ising - like interactions in the absence of magnetic field ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "then we investigate how the extensive degeneracy of these ground states is lifted by a small transverse field .",
    "finally , we discuss the effect of quantum fluctuations in the context of linear spin - wave theory .      in the absence of a transverse magnetic field ( @xmath31 ) ,",
    "we are left with a model without quantum fluctuations in which the interaction term couples only the @xmath32 components of neighboring spins on the honeycomb lattice . with our choice of gauge ,",
    "one bond on each hexagon is antiferromagnetic ( @xmath11 ) and the others are ferromagnetic ( @xmath33 ) . frustration is present since it is clearly impossible to minimize the energy of all bonds of a given hexagon .    for ising spins , i.e. spins which can only point up or down along the @xmath32 direction ,",
    "the best one can do is to satisfy five bonds leaving one unsatisfied .",
    "this can be done in six different ways according to which bond is not satisfied ( `` frustrated '' ) and the resulting energy is @xmath34 .",
    "up to a global reversal of the spins , a ground state is characterized by the distribution of frustrated bonds such that there is exactly one of them per hexagon .    for three - dimensional vectors of norm @xmath35 ,",
    "the situation is slightly more subtle because the twelve ising configurations with all spins parallel or antiparallel to @xmath32 axis are not the only ground states of a single hexagon . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a single hexagon and investigate the possibility of a given spin @xmath21 not to be directed along @xmath32 .",
    "the variation of the energy of the hexagon @xmath36 ( where the angle @xmath37 parameterizes the deviation of spin @xmath38 from the @xmath32 axis ) with respect to @xmath39 leads to the condition @xmath40 if this condition is satisfied , the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : single hexagon energy ] ) which depend on @xmath39 drop out , so that one is left with the energy of an open chain of five spins . in an open chain",
    "one can trivially minimize the energy of each bond by choosing @xmath41 which leads to @xmath42 and to the automatic fulfillment of condition ( [ eq : hexagon energy minimization ] ) , leaving @xmath39 arbitrary .",
    "note that this argument excludes a deviation from the @xmath32 axis of more than one spin , since the energy of a five - spin open chain can not be as low as @xmath34 if not all five spins are along @xmath32 .",
    "so , for three - dimensional spins , the energy of a single hexagon is minimal as soon as it is minimal for four consecutive bonds , and the spin at the remaining site can have any direction .",
    "it is natural to ask whether this additional freedom increases the degeneracy of the ground state manifold of the continuous model in comparison with the case of ising spins . to demonstrate that this is not the case ,",
    "let us assume that at site @xmath21 the spin is not along @xmath32 . to minimize simultaneously the energy of the three hexagons to which it belongs , three conditions of the form ( [ eq : hexagon energy minimization ] ) must be fulfilled : @xmath43    y_2+y_3=0\\,,\\\\[1 mm ]    y_3+y_1=0\\ , ,   \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 ( with @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 are the three nearest neighbors of site @xmath21 .",
    "it is evident that the restriction @xmath47 does not allow all three equations ( [ eq : system_three_hexagons ] ) to be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "therefore , it is impossible for any spin not to point along @xmath32 , and the ground state manifold coincides with that of the frustrated ising model with the same lattice , i.e. it consists of all ising configurations with one frustrated bond per hexagon . each of these states is a local minimum of the hamiltonian .",
    "let us now switch on a small transverse field and study how the local minima of the classical hamiltonian evolve upon increasing the field . since the field is along @xmath14 , the spins are expected to acquire a small @xmath14 component , and to describe the spin configuration evolving from a given ground state of the pure ising case , we use the parametrization : @xmath48      s_i^z=\\sigma_is\\cos\\theta_i \\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the sign of @xmath50 and is determined by the ground state of the pure ising case around which we expand . in terms of the gauge - invariant bond variable @xmath51 , which is equal to -1(+1 ) if the bond @xmath52 is frustrated ( not frustrated ) , the classical energy can be rewritten as @xmath53    in the limit @xmath54 the deviations from the @xmath32 direction are small , and the classical energy can be expanded in the variables @xmath39 around @xmath55 . to second order , the interaction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : classical energy ] ) decouples : @xmath56 .",
    "now , for any ground state of the pure ising case , the set @xmath57 is such that only one bond in each hexagon is frustrated",
    ". therefore each site belongs at most to one frustrated bond .",

    "so , second order corrections do not lift the degeneracy .",
    "they only induce a difference in orientation between the spins which belong to a frustrated bond and those which do not .",

    "they will thus not lift the degeneracy .",
    "by contrast , the crossed terms @xmath66 contribute in four different ways depending on the environment of the sites @xmath21 and @xmath38 .",

    "this contribution is a decreasing function of @xmath79 , so the lowest energy will be reached for the largest possible value of @xmath79 .",

    "a more important question is whether the plaquette and the first mixed states may be separated by a region where there appear mixed states of a different type , in which the density of columns is lower than in the first mixed state , so that the neighboring columns are separated by domains of plaquette state .",

    "the numerical evidence in favor of this conclusion comes from observing that the state which would differ from the first mixed state by having half its density of columns has a periodicity which is compatible with the 192-site cell used in our numerical energy minimization .",

    "this is indeed the case in the columnar phase , where the columnar states with domain walls of only the first type are selected already at the level of harmonic fluctuations .",
    "secondly , quantum fluctuations can shift the phase boundaries .",
    "when one takes into account only the harmonic fluctuations , this applies only to first - order transitions .",
    "indeed , at a first - order transition , the classical energy is the same for the two competing configurations , but the spectra of harmonic fluctuations are different , and one phase will in general be stabilized over the other by zero point fluctuations .",
    "a convenient way to keep track of the stability of the various phases with respect to quantum fluctuations is to draw a phase diagram in the ( @xmath18,@xmath135 ) plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sc phase diagram ] ) showing which phase has the lowest total energy",
    ".    the resulting phase diagram can be quite involved when there are many phases in competition , and this is clearly the case here since , for @xmath284 , there exists an infinite sequence of mixed phases .",
    "however , it turns out that for @xmath135 above @xmath285 only three of them survive , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc phase diagram ] .",
    "all other mixed phases exist only for @xmath286 in a very narrow range of transverse magnetic field of width @xmath287 .",
    "they are thus invisible on the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : sc phase diagram ] , which has been adjusted to properly describe the competition between the two main phases ( plaquette and columnar ) . on that scale ,",
    "the phase diagram consists of six phases : the polarized phase , the plaquette phase , the first , second and fourth mixed states , and the columnar phase .",
    "the general trend is that the plaquette phase is stabilized by quantum fluctuations over the mixed phases as well as the columnar phase .",
    "note that the transition between the plaquette and the columnar phases can not be followed below @xmath288 at this level of approximation because the plaquette phase is no longer locally stable with respect to harmonic fluctuations .",
    "the continuation of this boundary by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sc phase diagram ] is just a guide to the eye . to follow this line further",
    "would require to go beyond the harmonic approximation .",
    "the transition between the plaquette and polarized phases being of the second order , the boundary has to start vertically since , at the transition , both states have the same quantum corrections in the harmonic approximation .",

    "the results presented above suggest that the mixed phases have absolutely no chance to extend to @xmath293 .    regarding the competition between the columnar and the plaquette phases",
    ", we can get an estimate of the critical value of the spin at which the boundary between them crosses the axis @xmath31 by looking at the linear @xmath135 corrections starting from the point where the two phases have the same classical energy , a point that does not appear on the phase diagram of fig .  [",
    "fig : sc phase diagram ] since it lies inside the @xmath108 mixed phase .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the columnar phase disappears above @xmath294 , i.e. below @xmath295 .",
    "note that this should probably be considered as a lower bound in terms of @xmath35 since the boundary is slightly concave .",
    "so , for @xmath291 , the semiclassical calculation at the harmonic level predicts only two phases : a plaquette phase up to @xmath296 , and a polarized phase above .",
    "the fact that we find the point @xmath297 to be in the region of stability of the plaquette phase is in good agreement with the qdm , which has been found by qmc to be in the @xmath0 phase at @xmath163.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the classical phase diagram of the fftfim on the honeycomb lattice and how it is modified by the semiclassical corrections induced by harmonic fluctuations . as compared to what has been already known about the model , namely that the paramagnetic phase is unstable at @xmath296 towards a crystalline phase with a large unit cell , the classical phase diagram turns out to be surprisingly rich , with a multitude of additional phases : a columnar phase at small transverse field and an infinite cascade of phases of mixed columnar and plaquette character .",
    "the phase towards which the paramagnetic phase is unstable at @xmath296 has been found to have the same symmetry and periodicity as the state proposed in ref .  , but a different structure .",
    "both are characterized by a 24-site unit cell in the spin language , and by a 12-site cell on the dual lattice in the dimer language , but the state we have found has a plaquette structure . at the classical level ,",
    "the columnar phase is fully degenerate , all columnar states having rigorously the same classical energy .",
    "quantum fluctuations have been found to modify this phase diagram in two important respects .",
    "first of all , harmonic fluctuations have been shown to partially lift the degeneracy of the columnar phase in favor of the columnar states with only one type of domain walls .",
    "since the remaining degeneracy is not related to a symmetry of the model , anharmonic corrections are expected to lift further this degeneracy .",
    "secondly , they modify strongly the phase boundaries , and for the ultra quantum limit , @xmath291 , they predict that the plaquette phase survives down to @xmath298 .    going back to the original motivation of this investigation , namely the properties of the qdm on the triangular lattice , these results deserve a number of comments .",
    "first of all , our semiclassical approximation predicts that the phase which is the analog of the @xmath0 phase of the qdm has a 4-site plaquette structure .",
    "this reopens the issue of the nature of the @xmath0 phase of the qdm . according to the results of gfqmc",
    "simulations,@xcite possible structures are constrained by a quasi - extinction of the dimer density correlation function at the corner of the brillouin zone .",
    "this has been shown to be consistent with a uniform distribution of dimer density inside the interior part of the 12-site hexagonal unit cell , a conclusion somehow supported by the conclusions of ref .   regarding the nature of the phase close to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "now that we know that this phase is in fact a plaquette phase , it would be interesting to revisit the gfqmc results to see to which extent a plaquette phase of this type might be consistent with the quasi - extinction at the zone corner .",
    "it is also inspiring that a columnar phase appears in the classical solution of the fftfim since a similar phase is present in the qdm for attractive interactions between dimers . we did not manage to find a convincing connection between large @xmath35 in the fftfim and negative @xmath1 in the qdm , but since we found intermediate phases between the columnar phase and the plaquette phase in the fftfim , it is tempting to speculate that such phases may also exist in the qdm .",
    "the authors acknowledge useful discussions with g. misguich and the financial support of the swiss national fund and of manep .",
    "columnar states are the states which maximize @xmath79 , the number of pairs of frustrated bonds situated at the smallest possible distance from each other [ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2sitesdoublyfrustrated ] ] . in this appendix",
    "we want to compare the classical energy of these states with the energy of the states in which @xmath79 is minimal , that is , is equal to zero . in terms of dimer models",
    "such states are usually called staggered or nonflippable states , @xcite because they do not contain flippable pairs of dimers .    since in a staggered state",
    "all frustrated sites have identical environments ( with exactly one frustrated neighbor ) and all non - frustrated sites also have identical environments ( with exactly two frustrated neighbors ) , such a state can be described by the same two variables @xmath93 and @xmath94 introduced in sec . [",
    "sec : classical columnar states ] for the description of a columnar state . in terms of @xmath93 and",
    "@xmath94 the energy of a staggered state can be written as @xmath299\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] even without minimizing @xmath300 with respect to @xmath93 and @xmath94 one can notice that for any @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath301 and therefore the energy of a staggered state [ the minimum of @xmath302 has to be higher than the energy of a columnar state [ the minimum of @xmath303 achieved when @xmath304 .",
    "this proves that the maximization of @xmath79 is always a better strategy than its minimization , even when the ratio @xmath305 is not small ."
