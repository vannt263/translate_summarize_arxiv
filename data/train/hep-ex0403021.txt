    "a precise measurement of the top quark mass will be a main goal of top physics at the lhc . the combined top mass value from the tevatron run i is @xmath0 gev @xcite , and the expected accuracy obtained after run ii will be 3 gev @xcite .",
    "motivations for an accurate determination of the top quark mass are numerous .",
    "it is a fundamental parameter of the standard model ( sm ) and should therefore be measured as precisely as possible .",
    "an accurate value of the top mass would help to provide a rigorous consistency check of the sm and to constrain some parameters of the model such as the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "furthermore , a high level of accuracy on the top mass value ( for example improving the accuracy down to @xmath1 gev ) is also desirable , both within the sm and the minimal supersymetric standard model ( mssm ) framework @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "such an accuracy would significantly improve the precision on the w boson mass prediction while in the mssm , it would put constraints on the parameters of the scalar top sector and would therefore allow sensitive test of the model by comparing predictions with direct observations .    because the top quark , as other quarks , can not be observed as a free particle , the top quark mass is a purely theoretical notion and depends on the concept adopted for its definition .",
    "with increasingly - precise measurements on the horizon , it is important to have a firm grasp of exactly what is meant by the top quark mass .",
    "thus far the top quark mass has been experimentally defined by the position of the peak in the invariant mass distribution of the top quark s decay products , a w boson and a b quark jet .",
    "this closely corresponds to the pole mass of the top quark , defined as the real part of the pole in the top quark propagator .    the renormalisation scale dependence is less than 10 mev for the range of the scale between 30 - 150 gev .",
    "the dominant theoretical uncertainty for the top mass caused by uncertainty on the strong coupling constant is less than 150 mev to the binding energy , which would give uncertainty of 75 mev in the pole mass",
    ". corresponding theoretical uncertainty in the @xmath2 mass would be about @xmath312 mev@xcite .",
    "however , this definition is still adequate for the analysis of top quark production at lhc where uncertainty in the top mass measurement will be of order 1 gev .",
    "because of fragmentation effects it is believed that the top quark mass determination in an hadronic environment is inherently uncertain to @xmath4 @xcite@xcite .    at the lhc",
    ", the top quark will be produced mainly in pairs through the hard process @xmath5",
    "( @xmath6 of the total @xmath7 cross - section ) and @xmath8 ( remaining @xmath9 of the cross - section ) .",
    "the next - to - leading order cross - section prediction for @xmath7 production is @xmath10 pb @xcite .",
    "thus the lhc will be a top factory as more than 8 million @xmath7 pairs will be produced per year at low luminosity ( corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the electroweak single top production processes , whose cross - sections are in total approximately one third of those of @xmath7 production , have not been investigated for the determination of the top mass .    within the sm , the top quark decays almost exclusively into a w boson and a b - quark ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "depending on the decay mode of the w bosons the @xmath7 events can be classified into three channels : the lepton plus jets channel , the dilepton channel and the all jets channel . in the lepton plus jets channel",
    ", one of the w boson decays leptonically ( @xmath13 ) and the other one hadronically ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "considering electrons and muons , the branching ratio is @xmath15 .",
    "the final state topology is @xmath16 . in the dilepton channel , both w bosons decay leptonically with @xmath17 . in the all jets channel , both w bosons decay hadronically with @xmath18 .",
    "this paper summarizes studies of the top mass measurement , including updates of studies presented in the atlas technical design report @xcite as well as several new analysis .",
    "unless otherwise indicated , all analysis were performed with events generated with pythia @xcite and passed through the atlas fast simulation package atlfast @xcite for particles and jets reconstruction and momenta smearing .",
    "jets are defined as massless objects by summing the momenta of clusters of energy deposited in the calorimeters .",
    "clusters are associated to form jets using a cone algorithm with @xmath19 .",
    "a tagging efficiency of 60% for b - jets was assumed .",
    "cross - checks of some results have been made using the detailed geant - based simulation of the atlas detector .",
    "the top mass is extracted by an analytic fit to the event by event reconstructed invariant mass .",
    "the lepton plus jets channel is probably the most promising channel for an accurate determination of the top quark mass .",
    "three methods to measure the top mass are envisaged .",
    "the simplest method consists in extracting the top mass from the three jets invariant mass of the hadronic top decay . in the second method , the entire @xmath20 system is fully exploited to determine the top quark mass from a kinematic fit . in the last method , the top mass is still determined from a kinematic fit , but the jets are reconstructed using a continuous algorithm .      taking into account the total @xmath7 cross - section and the branching ratio , one can expect 2.5 millions @xmath7 pairs with this topology to be produced per year assuming an integrated luminosity @xmath21 .",
    "the signal final state @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) is characterized by one high transverse momentum lepton , large transverse missing energy @xmath24 , and high jet multiplicity .",
    "the following background processes were considered : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . at production level , the signal over background ratio is very unfavorable ( s / b @xmath31 ) .",
    ".[lepton_efficiency ] _ cross - section and selection efficiency for signal and background processes . for the background ,",
    "the hard scattering processes are generated with a cut on the transverse momentum at 20 gev _ [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the analyses presented in this paper are differently sensitive to the various sources of systematic errors .",
    "this will allow reliable cross - checks between the various methods and an efficient extraction of the combined atlas measurement of the top quark mass .    in the inclusive lepton plus jets channel ,",
    "errors are dominated by the b - jet energy scale and the knowledge of fsr .",
    "it was shown that these effects can be better controlled using a continuous jet definition .",
    "a possibility has been seen to reduce the systematic error due to the b - jet scale uncertainty by calibrating the b - jets with the same calibration as determined for light jets , though this must be further studied will full detector simulation before conclusions can be reached . in the lepton plus jets channel , using a sub - sample of hight @xmath32 top events , the top mass can be reconstructed with a large calorimeter cluster . in the all jets channels , it was demonstrated that the @xmath7 signal can be efficiently extracted from the huge qcd background . in the dilepton channel , it was presented that despite the two undetected neutrinos the final state can be fully reconstructed assuming a value for the top mass . finally , during the high luminosity phase of the lhc , the top mass can also be precisely determined in leptonic final states with @xmath33 .",
    "this work has been performed within the atlas collaboration and we would like to thank collaboration members for helpful discussions .",
    "we are very grateful to marina cobal and john parsons for their careful reading of the paper .",
