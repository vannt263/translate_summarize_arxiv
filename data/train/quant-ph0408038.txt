    "physics is an endeavor to construct a mathematical model of nature .",
    "the basic mathematical model of classical physics is one in which all dynamical variables have definite values simultaneously . with the advent of statistical mechanics ,",
    "a probabilistic description was introduced in which each dynamical variable would have some value with a certain probability .",
    "this is the most general description that classical physics can provide .",
    "a great variety of phenomena can be explained in terms of such a model .",
    "for example , most optical phenomena can be described in terms of a model of complex , stochastic amplitudes .",
    "it was not until 1977 that this model was found to break down in an experiment which demonstrated the phenomenon of antibunching @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine a relatively new type of measurement known as weak measurements @xcite .",
    "weak measurements may be performed in exactly the same way as standard von neumann measurements , but with a weakened interaction @xcite . in a weak measurement ,",
    "the pointer will on average register the expectation value of the observable that is measured",
    ". however , when the weak measurement is conditioned on a second postselection measurement , the pointer registers the real part of what is known as the  weak value \" of the observable .",
    "these weak values have caused a lot of controversy , in particular because they may exceed the eigenvalue spectrum of the observable .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to discuss the conditions under which a classical description of weak measurements is possible , taking into account practical experimental limitations and possibilities . in particular ,",
    "our purpose is to investigate in further detail the failure of providing a classical description of coherent states in such experiments , and to propose a feasible experiment demonstrating nonclassical properties of coherent states .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : glauber ] we give a brief review of the glauber classicality criterion , and discuss it s possible limitations .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak ] and appendices [ app : povm ] and [ app : weak ] we consider a general class of weak measurements where the object may be prepared in a mixed state , and where the pointer may be prepared in an arbitrary mixed state of vanishing current density .",
    "we consider detectors of arbitrary quantum efficiency , and derive a generalized weak value .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : classical ] we demonstrate that the weak value can be expressed as a conditional expectation over an infinite set of different quasi - probability distributions . these distributions can be regarded as generalizations of the complex kirkwood distribution @xcite or the standard ordered distribution @xcite .",
    "we denote such distributions by @xmath0-distributions . the terletsky - margenau - hill distribution , or @xmath1-distribution ,",
    "is the real parts of the @xmath0-distribution .",
    "we find that strange weak values ( for which the real part exceeds the eigenvalue spectrum of the observable ) can only exist if the @xmath1-distribution takes negative values .",
    "we demonstrate that a classical model of a weak measurement exists whenever the representation of the observable coincides with the classical representation of the observable and the @xmath1-distribution is nonnegative .",
    "we demonstrate in particular that negative weak values of energy contradict all classical stochastic models , and that negative weak values of photon number contradict a stochastic model where the energy is bounded from below by the zero - point energy .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimental ] we propose two feasible practical realizations of weak measurements of photon number and energy .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : coherent ] we consider in particular weak measurements on coherent states .",
    "we demonstrate that coherent states display negative weak values with probabilities of 16 % for kinetic energy ( or squared field quadrature ) , 8 % for harmonic oscillator energy and 50 % for photon number .",
    "we find that these effects are robust against detector inefficiency and thermal noise .",
    "glauber and sudarshan have demonstrated that any density operator can be expanded diagonally in terms of coherent states @xcite @xmath2 the weight function @xmath3 is known as the @xmath4-distribution .",
    "furthermore , one may write the expectation value of any normal ordered operator @xmath5 $ ] as an integral of the form @xmath6 \\rangle = \\int d^2 \\alpha o ( \\alpha^ * , \\alpha ) p(\\alpha),\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the @xmath8-number representation of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the @xmath8-number representation of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath4-distribution has the properties of a valid probability distribution , one may say that a classical representation exists for any normal ordered operator product .",
    "this is known as the  optical equivalence theorem \" @xcite .",
    "the optical equivalence theorem is the basis of the glauber classicality criterion , according to which all states for which the @xmath4-distribution is a probability distribution are regarded as essentially classical . if @xmath4 fails to be a probability distribution , the state is considered as nonclassical .",
    "the glauber criterion is widely accepted as giving the most general distinction between quantum and classical states .",
    "it is the basis of various measures of  nonclassicality \" .",
    "for example , hillery has defined a measure of nonclassicality based on the distance in hilbert space between the object state and coherent states @xcite .",
    "lee has defined a nonclassical depth defined as the minimum average number of thermal photons that must be added to render the @xmath4-distribution nonnegative @xcite .",
    "more recently , vogel _ et.al _ have derived a hierarchy of observable conditions to test the glauber criterion @xcite .",
    "the glauber criterion must be considered a conjecture rather than a proven theorem .",
    "it is based on some plausible arguments .",
    "firstly , due to the multitude of arguments in favor of coherent states as the only classical - like pure states , it is natural to assume that also classical mixtures of coherent states are classical .",
    "this is in fact equivalent to glauber s classicality criterion , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pdistr ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath4-distribution is a probability distribution , the density matrix can be expressed as a classical mixture of coherent states .",
    "secondly , a nonnegative @xmath4-distribution ensures that the whole range of @xmath12-ordered wigner distributions are also nonnegative .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4-distribution is most  sensitive \" to nonclassicality among all @xmath12-ordered distributions .",
    "it is puzzling that a definition of nonclassicality depends on the ability to represent expectations of _ normally ordered _ operator expressions as classical expectation values over a probability distribution .",
    "this is sometimes attributed to the fact that normal ordering of operators is closely associated to the theory of photo - detection .",
    "however , we may devise experimental procedures related to operator orderings different from normal ordering of annihilation and creation operators , that may display clear contradictions between the classical and quantum descriptions for the same experiment .",
    "this is actually the case of weak measurements , whose statistics are related to @xmath1-distributions instead of to the more standard @xmath12-ordered distributions .",
    "we show below that weak measurements lead to strange outputs provided that the @xmath1-distribution takes negative values .",
    "moreover , we will show in this paper that a classical stochastic model may fail to describe weak measurements even when the @xmath4-distribution is a nonnegative probability distribution .",
    "a  measurement \" comes about when an auxiliary system interacts with an object . by examining the properties of the auxiliary system after the interaction ,",
    "it may be possible to extract information about the object .",
    "the auxiliary system is frequently called a  measurement apparatus \" or a  pointer system \" . the basic theory of quantum measurement",
    "was examined by von neumann in his seminal work on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite . in this work ,",
    "von neumann represented the interaction between the object and the pointer by an interaction hamiltonian of the form ( throughout we will use units in which @xmath13 ) @xmath14 a short explanation of the terms involved is in place .",
    "the constant @xmath15 represents the interaction strength .",
    "the interaction is of short duration , represented in idealized form by the @xmath16-term .",
    "the hermitian observable @xmath17 belongs to the object hilbert system @xmath18 , and is the observable that we want to  measure \" .",
    "the observable @xmath19 is the pointer momentum , and belongs to the pointer hilbert space @xmath20 .",
    "although seemingly artificially constructed , this interaction model has served as an archetype of the interaction mechanism in quantum measurements .",
    "it has been found that the conclusions that can be drawn from this model are generic to a number of other interaction mechanisms ( for a closer discussion of the specific properties of this interaction hamiltonian , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in a standard , projective measurement",
    ", the pointer position @xmath21 , with @xmath22=i$ ] , displays one of the eigenvalues of the object observable @xmath17 after the measurement interaction .",
    "it was demonstrated by von neumann that in order to accomplish this , the state of the pointer prior to the interaction should have a small position spread @xcite .",
    "the same effect can be accomplished by allowing the interaction strength @xmath15 to be sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "for this reason , this type of measurement is frequently called a  strong measurement \" .    until recently , it was thought that strong measurements are the only useful type of measurements in quantum mechanics . however , in 1988 aharonov _ et.al . _",
    "proposed a new type of measurement that they called  weak measurements \" @xcite .",
    "such measurements also employ the von neumann interaction mechanism ( [ eq : quantuminteraction ] ) , the difference being that the pointer is assumed to be in an initial state of large position uncertainty .",
    "more specifically , they assumed that the initial state of the pointer was a gaussian with large spread .",
    "recently , it was shown that weak measurements can be performed also when the pointer is in an arbitrary mixed state , provided that the interaction strength @xmath15 is sufficiently small and the current density of the pointer vanishes @xcite .",
    "this description can be generalized further by taking into account finite efficiency of the detectors .",
    "a detector of finite efficiency can be represented by positive operator valued measure ( povm ) ( see appendix [ app : povm ] ) . in this case , the weak value of the observable @xmath17 conditioned on an imperfect postselection of the observable @xmath23 on the object is ( see appendix [ app : weak ] ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a diagonal povm representing the imperfect postselection and @xmath26 is the initial state of the object ( see eq .",

    "we will also understand under what circumstances weak measurements demonstrate nonclassical properties of the quantum state under consideration .",
    "we begin by inserting the definition ( [ eq : objectpovm ] ) for the diagonal postselection povm into eq .",

    "in fact , it is the weak value for the observable preselected in the state @xmath29 and postselected in the state @xmath33 . also , @xmath34 is a generalization of the kirkwood distribution for arbitrary observables @xmath35 and @xmath23 @xcite . the kirkwood distribution is also known as the anti - standard ordered distribution @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is also a generalization of the standard ordered distribution , which is the complex conjugate of the kirkwood distribution @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will simply denote it by the @xmath0-distribution , and we will refer to @xmath36 as the @xmath0-representation of the observable @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath0-distributions are in general complex , and as such are quasi - probability distributions .",
    "nevertheless , they possess some of the properties of classical joint distributions .",
    "for example , assuming that both eigenstates @xmath37 and @xmath38 constitute complete sets , it is straightforward to show that they yield correct marginal distributions when integrated over either variable , @xmath39 it is straightforward to show that also the complex conjugate distribution , @xmath40 , fulfills such marginality conditions .    the @xmath0-distribution can be expressed in the form @xmath41 in this form , the @xmath0-distribution is a product of a nonnegative probability distribution and the weak value of the density operator . if @xmath29 or @xmath37 are eigenstates of the density operator , @xmath0 will be real and nonnegative .",
    "classically , the weak value of an observable is the conditional expectation of that observable @xcite .",
    "the expression ( [ eq : gencond ] ) demonstrates that there exists an infinite set of representations under which the weak value can be expressed as a conditional expectation of a @xmath8-number variable @xmath36 over an @xmath0-distribution . for each choice of basis",
    "@xmath38 , a different @xmath0-distribution is obtained . however , some of these representations bear little resemblance to any classical model . for example , in some models the @xmath0-representation of the hermitian observable @xmath17 is complex . as a basic requirement on a _ classical _ model , we shall in the following",
    "restrict the attention to the subset of representations for which hermitian observables have real representations , @xmath42 we also introduce the @xmath1-representation of @xmath17 and the @xmath1-distribution , @xmath43 it is straightforward to show that also these provide correct marginal distributions , @xmath44 because of the classicality condition ( [ eq : realc ] ) , the @xmath0- and @xmath1-representations of the observable are the same , @xmath45 the distribution of the postselection observable @xmath23 , taking into account the finite detector efficiency represented by @xmath46 , can be found both from the complex @xmath0-distribution and the real @xmath1-distribution through the integrals @xmath47 in a weak measurement , the real part of the weak value @xmath48 is registered by the pointer . under the assumption ( [ eq : realc ] ) , we may write @xmath49 this expression , which reflects the expectation of the pointer displacement in a weak measurement , bears formal resemblance to a classical conditional expectation .",
    "the difference is that the @xmath1-distribution may take negative values , and that the @xmath1-representation of the observable may differ strongly from the representation of the observable in classical theory .",
    "a classical representation of the pointer displacement can be said to exist if @xmath50 equals the classical representation of the observable and if also the @xmath1-distribution is nonnegative .    what determines the sign of the @xmath1-distribution ? from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : weakdensity ] ) and ( [ eq : realpart ] ) it follows that @xmath51 thus , the sign of the @xmath1-distribution equals the sign of the real part of the weak value of the density operator .",
    "therefore , a requirement for nonclassicality is that the real part of the weak value of the density operator should be negative .    in the following , we consider two representations that may provide classical - like models of weak measurements . the first representation , which we shall call the _ eigenvalue representation _ , is found when the basis @xmath29 is chosen as eigenstates of the observable @xmath17 . in this representation",

    "it follows straightforwardly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : conditional ] ) that  strange weak values \" where the real part of @xmath48 exceeds the eigenvalue spectrum is only possible for quantum states for which the @xmath1-distribution in the eigenvalue representation takes negative values .",
    "but it is of course well known that classical models may allow observables to exceed the eigenvalue spectrum of the observable .",
    "this means also that  strange \" weak values may sometimes by supported by a classical model .",
    "in particular , this may be the case for observables with a discrete spectrum .    the other @xmath8-number representation that we shall consider is the _ phase space representation_. in this case , the basis @xmath58 should be chosen as eigenstates of the observable canonically conjugate to the postselection observable @xmath23 .",
    "this may provide the possibility of a comparison with a classical phase space description of weak measurements .",
    "we give a couple of examples illustrating the use of these two representations .",

    "it can be noted that a negative weak value of kinetic energy @xmath63 contradicts _ all _ stochastic @xmath8-number models where kinetic energy takes only nonnegative values , even models where the @xmath1-representation of kinetic energy may differ from the expression ( [ eq : kinetic ] ) .",
    "consider next a weak measurement of the energy of a harmonic oscillator ( we use units so that @xmath69 ) @xmath70 assuming postselection on one of the quadratures ( or position for a material particle ) . in the eigenvalue representation @xmath71 obviously , @xmath72 . in the eigenvalue representation ,",

    "( ii ) on the other hand , outputs of the form @xmath79 contradict all the classical stochastic models where the energy takes positive values .    in the phase - space representation ,",
    "a weak measurement of the energy of a harmonic oscillator postselected on one of the quadratures calls for the @xmath1-representation @xmath80 this representation of harmonic oscillator energy coincides with the classical representation , and therefore permits an investigation of the limits of classical models .",

    "( [ eq : realweak ] ) the inequality @xmath83 this inequality should be compared with inequality ( [ eq : strange ] ) .",
    "we may say that the phase - space representation highlights just the second category ( ii ) above : violation of inequality ( [ eq : continuousmodel ] ) rules out all the classical stochastic models where the energy takes positive values . note that the probability of infringing inequality ( [ eq : continuousmodel ] ) and the probability of the second category ( ii ) above are equal , since the probability of @xmath84 does not depend on the representation . on the other hand , the probability that @xmath84 is less than the probability of @xmath85 in agreement with the fact that the first one excludes a larger class of classical models .",
    "we have not mentioned the correspondence principle here .",

    "we will consider the same postselection strategy given by the measurement of the operator @xmath90 .    in this section",
    "we propose two simple and feasible schemes for the weak measurement of @xmath91 conditioned on the measurement of @xmath61 in the field of quantum optics , where @xmath91 represents the number of photons and @xmath61 is a field quadrature .",

    "a suitable coupling between the system @xmath11 and the auxiliary variables allowing a weak measurement of the number operator @xmath91 is of the form @xmath93        this coupling can be achieved in practice by propagation of both field modes in crystals with nonlinear optical properties ( cross - kerr interaction ) so that @xmath15 is proportional to the nonlinear susceptibility of the medium and the length of the crystal .",

    "in this section , we turn to the study of weak measurements on coherent states , taking into consideration the effect of thermal noise and finite detector efficiency .",
