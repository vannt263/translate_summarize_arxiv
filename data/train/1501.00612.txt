    "complex networks and complex systems describe the physical , biological , and social structures that connect our world and host the dynamical processes vital to our lives  @xcite .",
    "the failure of such large - scale systems to operate in the desired way can thus lead to catastrophic events such as power outages  @xcite , extinctions  @xcite , and economic collapses  @xcite .",
    "thus , the development and design of efficient and effective control mechanisms for such systems is not only a question of theoretical interest to mathematicians , but has a wide range of important applications in physics , chemistry , biology , engineering , and the social sciences  @xcite .",
    "the roots of modern linear and nonlinear control reach back several decades , but recently research in this direction has seen a revival in physics and engineering communities .",
    "for instance , the concept of _ structural controllability _ , which is based on the paradigm of linear homogenous dynamical systems , was first introduced by lin in @xcite and more recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "these advances have enabled further progress related to structural controllability such as centrality  @xcite , energy  @xcite , effect of correlations  @xcite , emergence of bimodality  @xcite , transtion and nonlocality  @xcite , the specific role of individual nodes  @xcite , target control  @xcite , and control of edges in switchboard dynamics  @xcite .",
    "significant advances have also been made in the control of nonlinear systems , for instance the control of chaotic systems using unstable periodic orbits  @xcite , control via pinning  @xcite , control and rescue of networks using compensatory perturbations  @xcite , and control via structural adaptation  @xcite .",
    "implicit in all such network control problems are the questions of ( i ) what form(s ) of control should one choose ? and",
    "( ii ) how much effort is needed to attain a desired state  @xcite ?    motivated by ongoing studies on the stability and function of power grids  @xcite , we study here the control of heterogeneous coupled oscillator networks  @xcite .",
    "recent research into smart grid technologies has shown that certain power grid networks called _ microgrids _ evolve and can be treated as networks of kuramoto phase oscillators  @xcite .",
    "a microgrid consists of a a relatively small number of localized sources and loads that , while typically operating in connection to a larger central power grid , can disconnect itself and operate autonomously as may be necessitated by physical or economical constraints .",
    "in particular , by means of a method known as _ frequency - drooping _ , the dynamics of microgrids become equivalent to kuramoto oscillator networks - a class of system for which a large body of literature detailing various dynamical phenomena exists  @xcite . here",
    "we develop a control mechanism for such coupled oscillator networks , thus providing a solution with potentially direct application to the control of certain power grids .",
    "our goal is to induce a synchronized state , a.k.a .",
    "_ consensus _ , in a given coupled oscillator network and guarantee asymptotic stability by applying as few control gains to the network as possible .",
    "our method is based on calculating the jacobian of the desired synchronized state and studying its spectrum , by which we identify the oscillators in the network that contribute to unstable eigenvalues and thus destabilize the synchronized state .",
    "importantly , our method not only identifies which oscillators require control , but also the required strength of each control gain .",
    "interestingly , we find that the control required to stabilize a network is dictated by the coupling strength , dynamical heterogeneity , and mean degree of the network , and depends little on the structural heterogeneity of the network . in other words , the number of nodes requiring control depends surprisingly little on the network topology and degree distribution and is more sensitive to the average connectivity of the network and the dynamical parameters .",
    "while kuramoto oscillator networks serve as our primary system of interest due both to its specific correlation with mircogrids as well as its rich body of literature , we note that our method can be applied to a much wider set of oscillator networks , provided that their linearized dynamics take a certain form .",
    "moreover , since kuramoto and other oscillator network models have served as a paradigmatic example for modeling and studying synchronization in various contexts , we hypothesize that our results may shed light more generally on the control of synchronization processes and could potentially give insight into other important applications such as the termination of cardiacarrhythmias  @xcite and treatments for pathological brain dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we consider the famous kuramoto model for the entrainment of many coupled dissipative oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the kuramoto model consists of @xmath0 phase oscillators @xmath1 for @xmath2 that , when placed on a network dictating their pair - wise interactions , evolve according to @xmath3 each oscillator @xmath4 has a unique nature frequency @xmath5 that describes its preferred angular velocity in the absence of interactions , which is typically drawn randomly from a distribution @xmath6 . furthermore , the global coupling strength @xmath7 describes the influence that oscillators have on one another via the network connectivity , which is encoded in the adjacency matrix @xmath8 $ ] . here",
    "we focus on the simple case of an undirected , unweighted network ( @xmath9 if oscillators @xmath4 and @xmath10 are connected by a link and @xmath11 otherwise ) , but we note that all results presented here easily generalize to directed and weighted networks .",
    "we also assume that the network is connected , i.e. , irreducible . over the last few decades",
    "the kuramoto model has proven to be very useful for modeling real - world systems  @xcite , uncovering the mechanisms behind emergent collective behavior  @xcite , exploring additional effects such as time - delays  @xcite and community structure  @xcite , and finding optimal networks structure  @xcite .",
    "depending on the coupling strength @xmath7 , as well as the frequency vector @xmath12 and the network topology , the steady - state dynamics of equation  ( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) can attain many different states that included complete incoherence , partial synchronization , and full synchronization .",
    "the latter is characterized by @xmath13 and is also referred to as full phase - locking , frequency - synchronization , or consensus .",
    "the fully synchronized state ( henceforth called the synchronized state ) typically displays a large degree of phase synchronization @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the standard kuramoto order parameter . in figure  [ fig1](a )",
    "we illustrate a synchronized state in a group of five oscillators , each moving with an angular velocity of @xmath16 .",
    "the order parameter is illustrated as vector of length @xmath17 with an offset angle @xmath18 from the positive real axis .      in this article",
    "we address the problem of control by first assuming that due to the system parameters ( i.e. , the coupling strength , natural frequency sequence , or network topology ) , the steady - state dynamics of equation  ( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) are at least partially incoherent , i.e. , one or more oscillators remains desynchronized . in the example of the power grid , a single desynchronized oscillator represents a single power failure , but can have further damaging effects , in particular triggering a cascade of additional failures and ultimately a power outage  @xcite .",
    "thus , our goal is to find a synchronized state and stabilize it .",
    "if all oscillators are initially synchronized , then our goal is trivially realized , however our method can be used to make this state more robustly stable . in a synchronized state like the one we seek here we expect the oscillators to be clustered in a single reasonably tight cluster such that @xmath19 , and thus equation  ( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) can be linearized to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the network laplacian matrix with entries @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the kronecker delta .",
    "a straight - forward analysis yields a `` target '' synchronized state ( within the rotating reference frame @xmath24 ) given by the vector @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the pseudo - inverse of the laplacian  @xcite .",
    "( we summarize a derivation of this result in materials and methods . )",
    "we note that , since the system is assumed to be partially incoherent , the fixed point @xmath27 either does not exist or is unstable .",
    "however , we take @xmath27 to represent the closest synchronized fixed point for the given parameter values , and therefore we use it a target .",
    "we also note that , while equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) was directly obtained from linearizing equation  ( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) , other systems of more general forms yield equivalent linearizations and therefore can also be controlled using the method we provide here .",
    "we present an example of such a general system with arbitrary coupling function ( e.g. , see @xcite ) in the materials and methods .",
    "the stability of @xmath27 is dictated by the jacobian matrix whose entries are defined @xmath28_{ij}=\\partial\\dot{\\theta}_i/\\partial\\theta_j$ ] , and is stable if all the eigenvalues of @xmath29 are non - positive . in our case we have that @xmath30 we note that each row ( and column ) of @xmath31 sums to zero , i.e. , satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "this is a particularly convenient property for using the gershgorin circle theorem  @xcite , which implies that eigenvalues of @xmath31 lie within the union of closed discs @xmath33 for @xmath2 , which are each centered at @xmath34 and have radius @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "( the full theorem is given in materials and methods . ) in particular , if all the off - diagonal entries of @xmath31 are non - negative , then it follows that each gershgorin disc is contained in the left - half plane , implying that all eigenvalues are non - positive and the solution is stable .",
    "an illustration of this case is presented in figure  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "if , however , one or more non - diagonal entries of @xmath31 are negative , then each gershgorin disc corresponding to a row with a negative off - diagonal entry enters the right - half plane , admitting the possibility for one or more positive eigenvalues and thus destabilization .",
    "thus , the oscillators that require control can be easily identified as those whose corresponding rows have one or more negative off - diagonal entries .",
    "we aim to stabilize the synchronized solution by adding one or more control gains to the system , as illustrated in figure  [ fig1](c ) . in following recent literature",
    ", we will refer to oscillators to which we apply control as _ driver nodes _ , and to oscillators to which we do not apply control as _",
    "free nodes_. we choose the control gains to take the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the strength of the @xmath39 control gain and @xmath40 is a target phase that can in principle depend on either local or global information , and vary in time . here",
    "we focus on the choice of target phase @xmath41 , and discuss other possibilities below . since the control gain depends on the current state of the system , this can be though of as a form of feedback control .",
    "the new dynamics are then given by @xmath42 where we take @xmath43 for free nodes .",
    "while the off - diagonal entries of @xmath31 remain unaltered , the new diagonal entries are given by @xmath44 .",
    "thus , we set coupling gain strength of each driver node @xmath4 such that it satisfies @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "this ensures that all gershgorin discs are contained in the left - half plane , implying that ( up to the linear approximation of @xmath46 ) all eigenvalues are non - positive and the synchronized state is stable .",
    "( in the case of a directed network this implies that all eigenvalues have non - positive real part and the synchronized state is stable . )    we now briefly comment on the choice of target phases @xmath40 in the control gains . in the method outlined above , we have set the target phase equal to the steady - state phase , @xmath41",
    "this is a convenient choice for the derivation described above .",
    "additionally , we find that in practice other choices also yield positive results .",
    "in particular , one choice that tends to yield slightly better results is to force each driver node towards the center of the synchronized cluster , i.e. , @xmath47 , where we assume the cluster is centered at the angle @xmath48 .",
    "target phases can also be chosen according to global or distributed control strategies .",
    "in particular , given the standard kuramoto order parameter @xmath49 or the set of local order parameters @xmath50 , the choices @xmath51 and @xmath52 correspond to global and distributed control strategies that typically yield favorable results .",
    "we also note before presenting examples that since the method outlined above depends on the approximation of the steady - state solution @xmath53 , in practice we add a buffer margin when identifying unstable oscillators , looking for non - diagonal entries of @xmath31 that are not necessarily negative , but rather less than some @xmath54 .",
    "we find that the choice @xmath55 is sufficient , and is what we use in the examples below .",
    "we now demonstrate our approach by considering two types of random networks : erds - rnyi  @xcite ( er ) networks and scale - free ( sf ) networks .",
    "each er network is constructed using a fixed link probability @xmath56 and each sf network is built using the configuration model  @xcite with a degree sequence drawn from the distribution @xmath57 with @xmath58 and enforced minimum degree @xmath59 . to tune the mean degree @xmath60 of each network we set either @xmath61 or @xmath62 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] illustrates our results with an example of each type of network , where we have used networks of size @xmath63 with mean degree @xmath64 , set the coupling strength @xmath65 , and used natural frequencies drawn from a uniform distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the top and bottom rows display the results for the er and sf networks , respectively , displaying the time series @xmath66 of a randomly selected @xmath67 of the oscillators without control [ first column , panels ( a ) and ( d ) ] and with control [ middle column , panels ( b ) and ( e ) ] , after discarding a long transient . the difference between no control to control is quite drastic , with a large fraction of desynchronized oscillators without control , and full synchronization with control .",
    "driver nodes constituted @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the er and sf networks , respectively , to attain the synchronized state . in the last column [ panels ( c ) and ( f ) ] we present the degree of phase synchronization , plotting the order parameter @xmath70 for both solutions with and without control . unlike the solution without control , which fluctuates significantly at a relative low value , the solution with control reaches a steady value near @xmath71 .",
    "next we investigate the properties of driver and free nodes by revisiting our method .",
    "this is an essential question due to the heterogeneity of the oscillators both in terms of network structure ( i.e. , degree distribution ) and also local dynamics ( i.e. , natural frequencies ) .",
    "an oscillator @xmath4 is a driver node if one of its off - diagonal entries @xmath72 is negative , and therefore oscillators with large ( small ) steady - state values @xmath73_i|$ ] tend to be driver ( free ) nodes .",
    "furthermore , we find that these values scale approximately linearly with the ratio of the natural frequencies to degrees , i.e. , @xmath74_i{\\mathrel{\\vcenter {    \\offinterlineskip\\halign{\\hfil$##$\\cr      \\propto\\cr\\noalign{\\kern2pt}\\sim\\cr\\noalign{\\kern-2pt}}}}}\\omega_i / k_i$ ] .",
    "we illustrate this is figure  [ fig3 ] , where we plot the relationship @xmath74_i$ ] vs @xmath75 for the example er and sf networks presented above [ panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively ] , denoting driver nodes with red crosses and free nodes with blue circles .",
    "these results show the important role that dynamics , in addition to network structure , plays in dictating controlling the system . in particular , driver nodes of the system tend to balance a large ratio ( in absolute value ) of natural frequencies to degrees .    finally , we quantify the overall effort required for consensus by studying how the fraction of driver nodes , denoted @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the total number of driver nodes , depends on both the system s dynamical and structural parameters . presenting our results in figure  [ fig4 ] ,",
    "we first explore how the fraction of driver nodes depends on the coupling strength by plotting in panel ( a ) @xmath78 vs @xmath7 for both er and sf networks with mean degrees @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 ( blue circles , red triangles , and green squares , respectively ) .",
    "results for er and sf networks are plotted with unfilled and filled symbols , respectively , and each curve represents an average over @xmath82 network realizations , each averaged over @xmath82 random natural frequency realizations . while it is expected that @xmath78 decreases monotonically with @xmath7 , the curves dependence on network topology and mean degree is nontrivial . in particular , the the shape of @xmath78 vs @xmath7 depends more sensitively on the mean degree than the topology , suggesting that network heterogeneity has little effect on overall control in comparison to average connectivity . in light of the significant dependence of overall control on the coupling strength , we investigate the coupling strength required to synchronize a network if limited mount of control is available . to this end",
    "we calculate for each family of networks the required coupling strengths @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for which , on average , a fraction @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 will achieve synchronization as a function of the average degree @xmath60 .",
    "we plot the results in figure  [ fig4 ]  ( b ) .",
    "we point out again that er and sf networks behave very similarly on average , and that with a larger mean degree , a smaller coupling strength is required to achieve synchronization .",
    "theoretical and practical aspects of the control of dynamical processes remains an important and ongoing area of interdisciplinary research at the intersection between mathematics , physics , biology , chemistry , engineering , and the social sciences .",
    "control of complex networks and complex systems is particularly important since together they comprise most of the world we live in  @xcite , however the nonlinear nature of realistic dynamical processes and the complex network topologies of real networks represent challenges for the scientific community .",
    "building on concepts from classical linear control theory  @xcite , recent work has made significant advances in understanding structural controllability  @xcite , and significant progress has been made in the development of control mechanisms for networks of nonlinear systems  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , due to the problem - sensitive nature of most real - world problems and applications requiring control techniques , further progress in designing and implementing efficient and effective control mechanisms for a wide range of problems with practical constraints remains an important avenue of research .    in this article",
    "we have focused on the control of synchronization , i.e. , consensus , in coupled oscillator networks .",
    "our primary inspiration has been advances in the research of power grid networks  @xcite . in particular , recent studies have shown that certain power grids known as microgrids can be treated as kuramoto oscillator networks  @xcite . here",
    "we have presented a control method that can easily be applied to kuramoto networks and other phase oscillator networks , thus providing a control framework with potentially direct application to these new technologies .",
    "our method is based on identifying and stabilizing a synchronized state for a given network via spectral properties of the jacobian matrix and we have demonstrated its effectiveness on both erds - rnyi and scale - free networks . we have observed that driver nodes , i.e. , oscillators that require control , tend to balance ( in absolute value ) large natural frequencies with small degrees .",
    "furthermore , the overall amount of control required to achieve synchronization decreases with both coupling strength and mean degree , while the total effort required to attain a synchronized state depends sensitively on the average connectivity of the network and the dynamical parameters , but surprisingly little on the network topology and degree distribution .",
    "these results enhance our understanding of and ability to understand , optimize , and ultimately control synchronization in power - grid networks ( see in particular  @xcite ) , and more generally complement important work on the control of network - coupled nonlinear dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "while our central inspiration and target application is in the area of power grid technology , synchronization phenomena plays a vital roll in a variety of complex processes that occur in both natural and man - made systems , including healthy cardiac behavior  @xcite , functionality of cell circuits  @xcite , stability of pedestrian bridges  @xcite , and communications security  @xcite . given this broad range of applications , we hypothesize that our findings here may potentially shed some light on the control of synchronization in other contexts , for instance cardiac physiology and neuroscience . for instance , a large amount of research has recently been devoted to the development of cardiac arrhythmia treatments that require minimal shock to knock out fatal asynchronous behavior such as cardiac fibrillation  @xcite and the promotion of normal brain oscillations  @xcite while repressing disorders such as parkinson s disease which are associated with abnormal oscillations  @xcite .",
    "to derive the steady state solution @xmath25 , we begin with equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) , which represents the linearized dynamics of equation  ( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) . recall that this linearization requires that we are searching for a synchronized state where all oscillators are tightly packed in a single cluster so we expect that @xmath19 .",
    "we also note that the mean frequency of all oscillators is given by the mean natural frequency @xmath89 .",
    "for simplicity we enter the rotating frame @xmath24 , effectively setting the mean frequency to zero .",
    "it is then convenient to write equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) in vector form , i.e. , @xmath90 where @xmath21 is the network laplacian whose entries are defined @xmath91 . while @xmath21 has a zero eigenvalue , denoted @xmath92 , rendering it non - invertible , it does have a pseudo - inverse defined using its other eigenvalues ( which are non - zero provided that the network is connect ) and corresponding eigenvectors , @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "each eigenvector is normalized such that @xmath94 forms an orthonormal basis for the space of vectors in @xmath95 with zero mean .",
    "thus , both @xmath21 and @xmath26 share a nullspace which is spanned by the eigenvector @xmath96 , and therefore map vectors onto the space of zero - mean vectors in @xmath95 . with the pseudoinverse in hand , we can finally obtain the desired steady - state solution by setting @xmath97 and solving for @xmath98 , which yields the solution @xmath25 , as desired .      here",
    "we present an example of a more general oscillator network than that in equation  ( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) that can be controlled using the same method detailed above .",
    "in particular , we generalize to account for an arbitrary coupling function @xmath99 , yielding @xmath100 we assume that @xmath99 is @xmath101-periodic and at least once continuously differentiable .",
    "importantly , @xmath102 need not satisfy @xmath103 , and thus coupling between neighboring oscillators can be _ frustrated _  @xcite , denoting that even when two oscillators are exactly equal , their interaction term does not vanish .",
    "provided that the coupling frustration is not too large , e.g. , @xmath104 , a tightly clustered synchronized state is attainable , and linearizing equation  ( [ eq : general01 ] ) yields @xmath105 importantly , by defining the quantities @xmath106 and @xmath107 , it is easy to see that the linearized dynamics of equation  ( [ eq : general02 ] ) are of the same form as equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) , and therefore the control method we present above can be readily applied .",

    "<S> the control of complex systems and network - coupled dynamical systems is a topic of vital theoretical importance in mathematics and physics with a wide range of applications in engineering and various other sciences . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by recent research into smart grid technologies we study here control of synchronization and consider the important case of networks of coupled phase oscillators with nonlinear interactions  a paradigmatic example that has guided our understanding of self - organization for decades . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a method for control based on identifying and stabilizing problematic oscillators , resulting in a stable spectrum of eigenvalues , and in turn a linearly stable synchronized state . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the amount of control , i.e. , number of oscillators , required to stabilize the network is primarily dictated by the coupling strength , dynamical heterogeneity , and mean degree of the network , and depends little on the structural heterogeneity of the network itself . </S>"
