    "when the substrate presents cusps , topological defect nucleate on them @xcite , and berreman s expression of the elastic contribution to the free - energy density , which is proportional to the wavenumber of the substrate structure @xmath0 , breaks down because of the emergence of a non - analytical contribution proportional to @xmath3 associated to the nucleated defects @xcite .",
    "this result constrasts with the phenomenology observed in smooth substrates , as sinuosidal substrates , where in absence of topological defects a suitable generalization of berreman s model works @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will complete the characterization of the elastic contribution to the surface free - energy density for sawtoothed substrates @xcite . beyond the @xmath3 term",
    "previously mentioned , we find that the next - to - leading contribution follows berreman s scaling with the wavenumber @xmath0 .",
    "the origin of this term is twofold : the deviations of the nematic director field with respect to the distortions imposed by the presence of the nucleated disclination lines , and the defect core contributions .",

    "( [ felastic2 ] ) as the interaction between the disclination line at @xmath209 with half its topological charge and the apexes at @xmath210 , again with half their topological charges @xcite .",
    "as the absolute values of the topological charges are always smaller or equal than @xmath207 , the nucleation of disclinations at the cusps of the surface is favourable with respect to bulk disclinations ( which only may have half - integer values ) . with this intepretation",
