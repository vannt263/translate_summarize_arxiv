    "majority of stars reside in binary systems @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of planet formation around binary systems would be different from that around single stars not only because the environment of the protoplanetary disk would be affected by the binary companion but also because the binary companion would affect the long - term stability of the planet orbit .",
    "therefore , one of the most generic environments to be considered in the study of planet formation should be that of a binary . however , the major planet - formation scenarios that have been developed over the past decades , e.g. , core - accretion theory @xcite and disk instability theory @xcite , were mostly focused on the case of single stars .",
    "although a considerable work has been done about the effect of binary companions on the planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the long - term orbital stability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this work was restricted to mostly theoretical studies and thus many details about the planet formation scenario remain uncertain .",
    "these details can be refined by the constraints provided by the sample of actually detected planetary systems .",
    "unfortunately , there exists only a total of 19 known planets in 17 binary systems and most of these planets exist under a similar environment , i.e. circumbinary planets orbiting very close binaries . to give details about the planet formation in binary systems , therefore , it is important to detect more of such planets residing under various environments .",
    "when a gravitational microlensing event is caused by a very wide binary object , the lensing behavior in the region around each lens component is approximated by chang - refsdal ( c - r ) lensing , which refers to the gravitational lensing of a point mass perturbed by a constant external shear @xmath0 @xcite . in the low shear regime ( @xmath1 )",
    ", c - r lensing induces a small astroid - shape caustic around the lens .",
    "the lensing behavior of a very close binary , on the other hand , can be approximated by a point - mass plus quadrupole lensing . in this case ,",
    "an astroidal caustic similar to the c - r lensing caustic is produced around the center of mass of the binary .",
    "for this reason , the event caused by a very wide or a very close binary lens is often referred to as the c - r lensing event . due to the existence of the caustic in the central region , c - r lensing events are identified by a short - term anomaly that appears near the peak of a very high - magnification event .",
    "although c - r lensing events are routinely detected from microlensing surveys , not much attention is paid to them because they are thought to be simply one type of numerous binary - lens events and thus of little scientific importance .    in this work , we point out that c - r lensing events provide an important channel to detect planets in binaries , both in close and wide binary systems . in order to demonstrate that dense and high - precision coverage of a c - r lensing - induced perturbation can provide a strong constraint on the existence of a planet in the wide range of the planet parameters , we present analysis of the actually observed c - r lensing event ogle-2015-blg-1319 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the lensing properties in the cases where the lens is composed of a single , binary , and triple masses .",
    "we also describe the c - r lensing behavior . in section 3",
    ", we estimate the detection efficiency of planets in binaries by conducting analysis of the lensing event ogle-2015-blg-1319 .",
    "we summarize the results and conclude in section 4 .",
    "when a point - mass lensing event occurs the lensing behavior is described by the lens equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the complex notations of the source and image positions , respectively , and @xmath5 represents the complex conjugate of @xmath6 . here",
    "all lengths are normalized to the angular einstein ring radius @xmath7 and the lens is positioned at the origin . solving the lens equation yields two solutions of image positions : one outside and the other inside the einstein ring .",
    "the magnification @xmath8 of each image @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the jacobian of the lens equation evaluated at the image positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the determinant of the jacobian . since the individual microlensing images can not be resolved , the observed lensing magnification is the sum of the magnifications of the individual images , i.e.  @xmath14 . for a point mass ,",
    "the magnification is represented analytically by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lens - source separation with the length normalized to @xmath7 , @xmath17 is the einstein time scale , @xmath18 is the time of the closest lens - source approach , and @xmath19 is the lens - source separation at @xmath18 . for a rectilinear relative lens - source motion ,",
    "the lensing light curve is characterized by a smooth and symmetric shape @xcite .",
    "when an event is produced by a lens composed multiple components , the lens equation is expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 represent the location , mass fraction , and mass of each lens component , respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath24 denotes the number of the lens components , and thus @xmath25 for a binary lens . here",
    "all lengths ( @xmath26 and @xmath6 s ) are in units of the angular einstein radius corresponding to the total mass of the lens , @xmath27 .",
    "one of the most important properties of a binary lens that differentiate from those of a single lens is the formation of caustics , which represent the sets of source positions at which @xmath28 and thus the magnification of a point source becomes infinite . as a result ,",
    "a binary - lensing light curve can exhibit strong deviations when a source approaches close to or passes over the caustic .",
    "caustics of a binary lens form a single or multiple sets of closed curves and each curve composed of concave curves that meet at cusps .",
    "the topology of the binary - lens caustic is broadly classified into 3 categories @xcite . in the case of a binary where the binary separation is greater than @xmath29{\\epsilon_1 } + \\sqrt[3]{\\epsilon_2})^{3/2}$ ] ( wide binary ) , there exist two sets of 4-cusp caustics that are located close to the individual lens components .",
    "when the binary separation is smaller than @xmath29{\\epsilon_1 } + \\sqrt[3]{\\epsilon_2})^{-3/4}$ ] ( close binary ) , the caustic is composed of 3 pieces , where the central caustic with 4 cusps is formed around the center of mass of the binary lens , and the other 2 triangular caustics are located away from the center of mass . in the intermediate separation region",
    ", there exists a single big caustic with 6 cusps . for the visual presentation of the binary caustic topology , see figure 3 of @xcite . in the extreme case where the binary separation is much greater or less than @xmath7 ,",
    "the 4-cusp central caustic has an astroid shape which is symmetric with respect to the binary axis and the line vertical to the binary axis .    for the exact description of the lensing behavior produced by a lens system of a planet orbiting a binary object , one needs the triple lens equation , i.e.  eq .  ( [ eq4 ] ) with @xmath30 . with the addition of a third lens component , the complexity of the lensing behavior greatly increases and caustics can exhibit self - intersection and nesting @xcite .",
    "( upper panel ) and the mass ratio between the planet and the host @xmath31 ( lower panel ) . both the caustic size and the binary separation are normalized to the angular einstein radius corresponding to the total lens mass . ]",
    "a planetary lens corresponds to the extreme case of a binary lens where the mass of one of the lens components is much smaller than the other , i.e.  @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in this case , the lens equation is approximated as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass ratio between the planet and the host and @xmath36 represents the position of the planet with respect to the host .",
    "we note that the lengths of @xmath26 and @xmath6 s in eq .",
    "( 5 ) are normalized to the angular einstein radius corresponding to the mass of the primary lens , i.e.  @xmath37 . for a planetary lens , however , the mass of the primary dominates , i.e.  @xmath38 , and thus @xmath39 .",
    "the planet induces two types of caustics , where one is located close to the host ( central caustic ) and the other is away from the host .",
    "the central caustic has an arrowhead shape and its size is related to the star - planet separation @xmath40 and the mass ratio by @xcite @xmath41 due to the location of the central caustic close to the host , perturbations induced by the central caustic of a planet always appear near the peak of the lensing light curve produced by the host of the planet @xcite .",
    "the lens equation of c - r lensing is expressed as @xmath42 which describes the lensing behavior around the primary lens with an external shear @xmath0 . here",
    "lengths are given in units of the einstein radius corresponding to the primary mass .",
    "the shear induces a caustic around the lens .",
    "the shape of the caustic is similar to the central caustic of a very wide binary lens and thus the c - r lensing provides a good approximation in describing the binary lensing behavior in the region around the caustic . for a very close binary lens ,",
    "the lensing behavior around the center of mass is described by quadrupole lensing @xcite , which also induces an astroidal caustic similar to the c - r lensing caustic . to the first order approximation , the caustic size in units of the angular einstein radius of the binary - lens mass , @xmath7 ,",
    "is related to the separation and the mass ratio between the binary - lens components by @xmath43 for a wide binary and @xmath44 for a close binary .",
    "a c - r lensing event can provide a channel to detect planets in binary systems .",
    "this is because both of the c - r lensing caustic and the central caustic induced by the planet occur in the same region around the primary lens and the size of the planet - induced central caustic can be comparable to the size of the c - r lensing caustic @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the sizes of the c - r lensing caustic and the planet - induced central caustic as a function of the primary - companion separation . we note that a pair of caustics with separations @xmath45 and @xmath46 have the same size to a linear order and thus we present distributions for only wide binaries .",
    "the plot shows that the central caustic induced by planets located in the `` lensing zone '' , although the range varies depending on how the lensing zone is defined . ]",
    "is of considerable size compared to the size of the c - r lensing caustic .",
    "this suggests that the c - r lensing anomaly can be additionally affected by the planetary perturbation , enabling one to identify the presence of a planet in the binary system . in figure  [ fig : two ] , we present the variation of the c - r lensing caustic and the lensing light curve affected by the presence of planets with various separations and mass ratios between the planet and the primary of the binary .",
    "see @xcite for more details about the caustic variation .",
    "we note that the c - r lensing channel enables detections of planets not only in close binaries but also in wide binaries . to be dynamically stable",
    ", a planet should be either in a circumbinary ( or p - type ) orbit , where the planet orbits the barycenter of the two stars of a close binary , or in a circumprimary ( s - type ) orbit , where the planet orbits just one star of a wide binary system .",
    "this condition of the planet existence in the binary system matches the lens system configuration of the proposed c - r lensing channel of planet detections .",
    "planets in binary systems can be detected by various methods such as transit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , eclipsing binary timing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and radial - velocity methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "due to the intrinsic nature of the methods , however , it is difficult to detect planets in circumprimary orbits and thus all planets in binaries detected by these methods , 19 in total , reside in circumbinary orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "c - r lensing events can be produced by both close and wide binary systems and thus the proposed c - r lensing channel provides a unique channel to detect planets both in circumbinary and circumprimary orbits .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed c - r lensing channel in detecting planets of binary systems . estimating the efficiency requires to consider various details of observational conditions such as photometric precision and cadence . in order to reflect realistic observational conditions",
    ", we estimate the detection efficiency for an example c - r lensing event that was actually observed by lensing experiments .",
    "the event used for our efficiency estimation is ogle-2015-blg-1319 .",
    "the event was analyzed in detail by @xcite and turned out to be an exemplary c - r lensing event caused either by a close or a wide binary lens .",
    "figure  [ fig : three ] shows the light curve of the event reproduced based on the same data sets as those used in the previous analysis .",
    "the model light curve superposed on the data points is obtained from binary - lensing modeling based on one of the 8 degenerate solutions ( `` + + wide '' solution ) presented in @xcite .",
    "the inset in the lower panel shows the source trajectory with respect to the caustic , which has a very characteristic shape of a c - r lensing caustic .",
    "the anomaly caused by the c - r lensing caustic in the peak of the light curve was densely and precisely observed .",
    "this was possible because the event was predicted to be a high - magnification event before it reached the peak based on the light curve obtained from the survey observation conducted by the optical gravitational lens experiment ( ogle : * ? ? ? * ) and the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , enabling intensive observations of the peak by follow - up observation groups including the microlensing follow - up network ( @xmath47fun : * ? ? ? * ) and the robonet @xcite groups .",
    "we note that the event was also observed in space using two space telescopes _",
    "spitzer _ and _ swift_. this enabled the determinations of the lens mass and the distance , but we do not use the space - based data because these data are irrelevant to our scientific purpose .",
    "the values of the binary separation and the mass ratio presented in @xcite are @xmath48 for the close binary solution and and @xmath49 for the wide solution . for other lensing parameters ,",
    "see table 1 of @xcite .    to show the constraint on the existence of a planet",
    ", we construct an `` exclusion diagram '' , which shows the probability of excluding the existence of a planet as a function of the planet separation and the mass ratio @xcite .",
    "we construct the exclusion diagram following the procedure of @xcite . in this procedure",
    ", we first introduce a planet with the parameters @xmath50 to the binary lens with the parameters @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath51 represent the separation and the mass ratio between the binary components , while @xmath52 are the separation and the mass ratio between the primary of the binary and the planet .",
    "the angle @xmath53 denotes the orientation angle of the planet with respect to the binary axis connecting the binary lens components .",
    "we use @xmath51 that are determined from the binary - lensing modeling . for a given set of @xmath50 ,",
    "we then search for other parameters that yield the best fit to the observed light curve and compute @xmath54 of the fit .",
    "we repeat this process for many different orientation angles .",
    "then , the probability of excluding a planet for a given @xmath52 is estimated as the fraction of the angles @xmath53 that result in fits with @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the difference between the triple - lens ( i.e.  binary + planet ) and the binary - lens models . as a criteria for the planet detection",
    ", we adopt a threshold value of @xmath57 , which is a generally agreed value for planets detected through the high - magnification channel @xcite .",
    "the probability of excluding a planet corresponds to the probability of detecting the planet , i.e.  planet detection efficiency .     and the mass ratio @xmath31 between the planet and the primary of the binary lens .",
    "the values marked in the upper @xmath58 axis and the right of @xmath59 axis represent the physical primary - planet separation in au and the mass of the planet in jupiter masses , respectively .",
    "the color coding represents the regions of different efficiencies that are marked in the legend .",
    "the planetary separation is expressed in units of the angular einstein radius corresponding to the binary lens mass . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : four ] shows the constructed exclusion diagram which shows the planet detection efficiency as a function of the normalized separation @xmath60 and the mass ratio @xmath31 of the planet . since the microlens parallax of the event ogle-2015-blg-1319 was determined using the combined data taken from the ground and space , the physical sizes of the primary - planet separation and the mass of the planet were determined . by adopting the lens mass of @xmath61 , the angular einstein radius of @xmath62  mas , and the distance to the lens of @xmath63  kpc , that were determined by @xcite , i.e.  ( + , + ) wide model , we convert @xmath60 and @xmath31 into the physical sizes of the primary - planet separation in au , i.e.  @xmath64 , and the mass of the planet in jupiter masses ( @xmath65 ) , i.e.  @xmath66 , and they are presented in the upper @xmath58 axis and the right of the @xmath59 axis , respectively .",
    "lccc jupiter & 1.0  10 au & 0.5  11 au & 0.4  18 au + saturn & 2.0  5 au & 1.0  7 au & 0.9  9 au + neptune &  & 2.0  3.5 au & 1.8  4.0 au    in table  [ table : one ] , we present the ranges of planet detection for 3 different planets with masses corresponding to those of the jupiter , saturn ( @xmath67 ) , and neptune ( @xmath68 ) of the solar system .",
    "it is found that the detection efficiency is greater than @xmath69 for the jupiter- and saturn - mass planets located in the ranges of 1.0  10 au and 2.0  5 au from the host , respectively .",
    "the ranges with @xmath70 probability are 0.4  18 au , 0.9  9 au , and 1.8  4 au for the jupiter- , saturn- , and neptune - mass planets , respecively .",
    "these ranges encompass wide regions around snow lines where giants are believed to form .    despite the high efficiency of c - r lensing events in detecting planets of binary systems",
    ", there exists no report of planet detection yet . the reasons for this can be ( 1 ) the rarity of c - r lensing events , ( 2 ) the unoptimized observational strategy for planet detections , and ( 3 ) the rarity of planets in the region of sensitivity .",
    "considering the existence of the already known microlensing planets detected through the repeating - event channel and those detected by other methods combined with the wide region of planet sensitivity of the c - r lensing channel , the reason ( 3 ) is unlikely to be the main reason of nondetection . to check the possibilities ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we investigate the lensing events reported by the ogle and moa surveys in 2015 season . from the systematic analyses of all high - magnification events with anomalies near the peaks based on the online data of the surveys",
    ", we find 12 c - r lensing events including ogle-2015-blg-1319 , moa-2015-blg-040/ogle-2015-blg-0318 , ogle-2015-blg-0697/moa-2015-blg-148 , ogle-2015-blg-0797 , ogle-2015-blg-0812 , ogle-2015-blg-0189 moa-2015-blg-085/ogle-2015-blg-0472 , ogle-2015-blg-0313/moa-2015-blg-047 , ogle-2015-blg-0033/moa-2015-blg-017 , moa-2015-blg-047 , ogle-2015-blg-0919 , and ogle-2015-blg-0863 .",
    "this indicates that the rarity of c - r lensing events is not the reason for the nondetection , either .",
    "however , we find that the coverage of the peak regions for all of the c - r lensing events except ogle-2015-blg-1319 was not dense enough to constrain the existence of a planet .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the main reason for the nondetection of planet is due to the unoptimized observational strategy . in other words",
    ", this suggests that planets can be detected through the proposed channel in abundance with an aggressive strategy to densely cover the peak regions of high - magnification events , e.g. , vigilant monitoring of high - magnification events and timely alerts of anomalies followed by prompt and intensive coverage of the anomalies by follow - up observations",
    "we pointed out that c - r lensing events could provide one with an important channel to detect planets in binary systems .",
    "we also pointed out that while other methods could detect planets only in circumbinary orbits the proposed c - r lensing channel could provide a unique channel to detect planets both in circumbinary and circumprimary orbits .",
    "we demonstrated the high sensitivity of the c - r lensing channel to planets in a wide range of planet parameter space by presenting the exclusion diagram for an actually observed c - r lensing event .",
    "we mentioned that an increased number of microlensing planets in binary systems could be detected with an aggressive strategy to densely cover the peak regions of high - magnification events .",
    "the sample of an increased number of microlensing planets in binaries will make it possible to provide important observational constraints that can give shape to the details of the formation scenario which has been restricted to the case of single stars .    work by c.  han was supported by the creative research initiative program ( 2009 - 0081561 ) of national research foundation of korea .",
