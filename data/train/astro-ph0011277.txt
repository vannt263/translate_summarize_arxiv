    "i  band surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) have been successfully used to measure early - type galaxy distances up to 4000 km / s from the ground and up to 7000 km / s with the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "this method was introduced by tonry & schneider 1988 ( a recent review has been given by blakeslee et al .",
    "1999a ) and is based on a simple concept .",
    "the poissonian distribution of unresolved stars in a galaxy produces fluctuations in each pixel of the galaxy image .",
    "the variance of these fluctuations is inversely proportional to the square of the galaxy distance .",
    "the sbf amplitude is defined like this variance normalized to the mean flux of the galaxy in each pixel @xcite . the stars that contribute the most to the sbf are then the brightest stars in the intrinsic luminosity function , typically red giants in old stellar populations .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the fluctuation is not a constant , but depends on the age and metallicity of the stellar population . as such it is a strong function of not only the photometric band in which the observations are carried out , but also of the color of the galaxy under study .",
    "tonry et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and tonry et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have quantified these dependencies using an extensive sample of i and v band observations , which are used to empirically calibrate the dependence of the i - band fluctuation magnitude on ( v - i ) color .",
    "the absolute calibration is then obtained using a set of 5 galaxies with independent cepheid distance .",
    "the i  band sbf absolute magnitude calibration can be written as : @xmath5 .",

    "( 2000a ) have obtained their own calibration based on accurate cepheid distances to six spiral galaxies with sbf measurements within 1200 km / s .",
    "the cepheid distances were part of a larger dataset of 18 distances to galaxies within the fornax and virgo clusters observed by the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale .",
    "the two calibrations are consistent within the errors .",
    "the potential of these measurements extends to the measurements of cosmological parameters and the study of the dynamics of the universe .",
    "sbf distances have been used in measuring the hubble constant in the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2000a , and references therein ) .",
    "tonry and his collaborators @xcite have derived peculiar velocities from their ground based sample up to 4000  km / s and calculated bulk flows in this region . by comparing these peculiar velocities with infrared and optical surveys ,",
    "blakeslee et al .",
    "1999a have been able to constrain the value of the hubble constant and the parameter density ( luminous plus dark matter ) @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the linear bias @xcite .    however , the current i  band sample is limited to 4000  km / s .",
    "the introduction of large telescopes , such as the very large telescope ( vlt ) , have opened new opportunities to extend the current sample from the ground . with the optical instrument fors1 and fors2 on vlt , from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it will be possible to extend i  band sbf with high signal  to  noise and good understanding of external source contribution up to @xmath0 7000  km / s @xcite .",
    "this implies that ground  based measurements can be used to probe the same volume as hst measurements .    to illustrate the potential of i  band sbf measurements with the vlt ,",
    "we have observed ic 4296 in abell 3565 .",
    "this galaxy is part of the brightest ellipticals in the abell clusters observed in the lauer & postman 1992 sample .",
    "an i  band sbf distance measurement of this galaxy , based on hst observations , has already been reported by lauer et al .",
    "we compare our sbf measurements with lauer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and obtain similar results and measurement precision , being our errors and external source contribution estimation comparable with hst capabilities .",

    "the nights of observation were on 19 june and 24 july 1999 for the i  band and on 1 september 1999 for the v  band .",
    "the imaging camera was fors1 ( focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ) with a 2048 x 2048 pixel tektronix ccd .",
    "the low gain , standard resolution mode , was used , with a pixel scale 0.2@xmath8/pixel and field of view 6.8@xmath9 x 6.8@xmath9 .",
