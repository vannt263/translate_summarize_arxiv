    "transportation systems , especially mass transit , are an important component in cities and their expansion . in a world where more than @xmath4 of the population lives in urban areas",
    "@xcite , and where individual transportation increases in cost as cities grow larger , mass transit and in particular , subway networks , are central to the evolution of cities , their spatial organization @xcite and dynamical processes occurring in them @xcite . the percentage @xmath5 of cities with a subway system versus their population size @xmath6 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : percent ] ( the data were obtained for cities with population larger than @xmath7 @xcite ) which confirms that the larger a city , the more likely it is to have some form of mass transit system ( see also @xcite ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     in particular , for moscow which has long branches , we observe a behavior consistent with @xmath8 while for the other networks , we observe an increasing trend but an accurate estimate of @xmath9 is difficult to obtain , given the small variation range of @xmath10  with no more than one decade of available data .",
    "for example , a fit over this decade of data gives for paris @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) in agreement with the result obtained in @xcite . despite the difficulty of obtaining accurate quantitative results , more data is needed to have a definite answer and",
    "so far we can only claim that the data are not inconsistent with the behavior eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) , which supports our picture of a long time limit network shape made of a core and radial branches .",
    "in summary , we have observed a number of similarities between different subway systems for the world s largest cities , despite their geographical and historical differences .",
    "first , we have shown that the largest subway networks exhibit a similar temporal decrease of most fluctuations around their long term stable values and thus converge to a similar structure .",
    "we identified and characterized the shape of this long time limiting graph as a structure made of core and branches which appears to be relatively independent of the peculiar historical idiosyncracies associated with the evolution of these particular cities .    for large networks ,",
    "we generally observe a fraction of branches of about @xmath13 for most networks , and a ratio for the spatial extensions of branches to the core of about @xmath14 .",
    "the number of branches scales roughly as the square root of the number of stations .",
    "the core of these different city networks has approximately the same average degree which is increasing with network size , from @xmath15 to @xmath16 when @xmath17 , after which it approximately remains within the interval @xmath18 $ ] ( with moderate fluctuations ) .",
    "the fraction of @xmath1 nodes in the core is generally larger than @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , this picture of a core with branches and an increasing spacing between consecutive stations on these branches is confirmed by spatial measurements such as the number of stations at a given distance @xmath10 and provides a natural interpretation to these measures .",
    "the evolution of networks in general and urban networks in particular represents an exciting unexplored problem which mixes spatial and topological properties in unusual and often counterintuitive ways .",
    "they require a specific set of indicators that describe these phenomena .",
    "other data such as population density , land use activity distribution , and traffic flows are likely to bring relevant information to this problem and would undoubtedly enrich our study .",
    "we believe however that the present approach represents an important exploratory step in our understanding and is crucial for the modeling of the evolution of urban networks .",
    "in particular , the existence of unique long - time limit topological and spatial features is a universal signature that fundamental mechanisms , independent of historical and geographical differences , contribute to the evolution of these transportation networks .",

    "<S> the number of branches scales roughly as the square root of the number of stations , the current proportion of branches represents about half of the total number of stations , and the average diameter of branches is about twice the average radial extension of the core . spatial measures such as the number of stations at a given distance to the barycenter display a first regime which grows as @xmath3 followed by another regime with different exponents , and eventually saturates . these results  difficult to interpret in the framework of fractal geometry  </S>",
    "<S> confirm and yield a natural explanation in the geometric picture of this core and their branches : the first regime corresponds to a uniform core , while the second regime is controlled by the interstation spacing on branches . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent convergence towards a unique network shape in the temporal limit suggests the existence of dominant , universal mechanisms governing the evolution of these structures . </S>"
