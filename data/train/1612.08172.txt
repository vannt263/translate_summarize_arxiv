    "being the simplest nucleus , deuteron provides the most direct test of the various nucleon - nucleon interaction models and the relevant degrees of freedom . in this context , the deuteron electromagnetic studies through electron or photon probes are the simplest in theoretical and experimental aspects .",
    "these studies provide picture of deuteron electromagnetic structure in terms of deuteron electromagnetic ( em ) form factors ( ffs ) .",
    "these ffs depend on the square of the four - momentum transferred by a probe ( @xmath1 ) .    during the last two decades",
    "a considerable advance has been made in the experimental knowledge of deuteron electromagnetic structure .",
    "on the other hand there is a substantial diversity of opinion regarding an appropriate theoretical general approach .",
    "though , it seems natural as well as confirmed by the general data analysis @xcite that in the space - like region of @xmath2 ( corresponding to the elastic scattering ) a successful theory may be obtained from a relativistic description of only the @xmath3 channel together with minor modifications of the short - range structure of the deuteron electromagnetic current ( emc ) operator . here again , there are different approaches concerning the relativistic description as well as the emc operator structure @xcite .",
    "it is customary to assume that most of the existing data of @xmath0 elastic scattering are described to high precision in the one - photon exchange approximation and by three electromagnetic deuteron ffs @xcite .",
    "the deuteron ffs are calculated from the deuteron wave function ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 components ) and from the nucleon ffs in the conventional model .",
    "ffs may be chosen so as to be equal at @xmath6 ( static ) limit to the deuteron charge , magnetic and quadruple momenta .",
    "the first two are described by the conventional nuclear model with only nucleon degrees of freedom .",
    "but deuteron static electric quadrupole moment is not reproduced well enough by the modern @xmath3 potential calculations .",
    "it is generally agreed that the meson exchange contributions must be taken into account for agreement with data .",
    "the one - photon exchange approximation assumes that the electron and deuteron exchange a single virtual photon .",
    "it is believed that for the most part this approximation must be valid to high precision because of the small value of the fine - structure constant .",
    "therefore the elastic @xmath0 scattering allows to extract the deuteron em ffs dependencies on the transferred 4-momentum @xmath7 in the space - like region . to extract these dependencies it is required to measure three independent observables of the @xmath0 elastic scattering in the region .",
    "two of them ( structure functions a and b ) are extracted from the unpolarized differential cross section and third one is extracted from polarization measurements .    at low @xmath8 simple non relativistic calculations with realistic @xmath3 potentials ( with @xmath3 channel only )",
    "agree well enough with one another and with the @xmath0 elastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "with rise of @xmath9 disagreement increases between various calculations .",
    "none of the calculations describes data for @xmath10 .",
    "this disagreement indicates that relativistic effects and effects of other channels may be essential at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "indeed , inclusion of relativistic and meson exchange corrections gives good description of the data @xcite .",
    "there is another problem here that is not usually emphasized .",
    "the important ingredients of the calculations are nucleons ffs dependencies on the @xmath11 transferred to the individual nucleon .",
    "these dependencies are extracted experimentally .",
    "the proton ffs are extracted from direct measurements with proton target .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case there is a notable discrepancy between the extracted values of the proton ff ratio , @xmath12 , from polarization and those obtained from cross section experiments .",
    "the cross sections are necessary to extract the absolute value of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while polarization transfer measurements give only ration @xmath12 .",
    "the discrepancy begins at @xmath15 .",
    "it may be explained by the hard two - photon exchange process ( tpe ) and data show some evidences of the explanation @xcite .",
    "it also should be noted that model calculations and analyses show that tpe significantly change values of @xmath13 , while @xmath14 changes at the few percent level ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "the latest analytical fit for the proton ffs is a simultaneous fit of the polarization and cross section data .",
    "the cross section data are corrected by an additive term assuming some phenomenological expressions of the tpe correction @xcite .",
    "a free neutron target does not exist .",
    "the neutron ffs are extracted from measurements of @xmath0 or @xmath17 scattering .",
    "therefore , the data analysis is affected by uncertainties stemming from the assumed nuclear theoretical model to describe the target nucleus and the used reaction .",
    "a common procedure of neutron ffs extraction may be exemplified as follows . in @xcite the electric ff of the neuteron",
    "was measured up to @xmath18 using @xmath19 reaction .",
    "details of extraction include calculations of the asymmetries in the quasi - elastic processes @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "these calculations were performed using the generalized eikonal approximation ( gea ) , and included the spin - dependent final - state interactions and meson - exchange currents , and used the @xmath21 wave function that results from the av18 potential . finally , to extract @xmath22 the linearly interpolated values of @xmath23 from @xcite were used .",
    "procedure of @xcite is a measurement of the ratio r of the cross sections for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 reactions in quasielastic scattering on deuterium . to extract @xmath23 from the r they use :",
    "1 ) the cross section calculation using the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) for @xmath26 , the av18 deuteron wave function , and glauber theory for final - state interactions ( fsi ) ; 2 ) calculation of the nuclear correction factor being the ratio of the full calculation to the pwia without fsi ; 3 ) the proton cross section ( parametrization of @xcite ) ; 4 ) and finally parameterizations of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "obviously it looks like a vicious circle .",
    "there is a model insensitive technique of @xmath22 extraction @xcite but it is applicable only to the quasi - free kinematics of the @xmath27 reaction .",
    "this technique was used for extraction of @xmath22 at @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) @xcite and gave @xmath30 . the `` scale '' uncertainty ( @xmath31 )",
    "was estimated using an independent measurements of @xmath23 , and some `` arenhvel s model '' .",
    "that sounds convincing and may mean argonne v14 or other contemporary phenomenological potentials used in the estimation .",
    "but there is no estimation of the model systematic error and the whole procedure is an obvious vicious circle .",
    "there are various relativistic models for calculation of the deuteron em ffs @xcite .",
    "all of them are reasonable but they may give different results .",
    "that is not a contradiction",
    ". the question is discussed in the last part of the paper . in this paper",
    "we extend our previous investigations where we described elastic @xmath3 scattering up to 3  @xmath32 of laboratory energy @xcite , and electromagnetic reactions with two nucleons : bremsstrahlung in the @xmath33 scattering @xmath34 @xcite , photodisintegration of deuteron @xmath35 @xcite , exclusive electrodisintegration of deuteron @xcite and the @xmath0 elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "we apply manifestly covariant relativistic quantum mechanics ( rqm ) @xcite in point - form ( pf ) .",
    "the pf is one of the three forms of rqm proposed by dirac @xcite .",
    "the other two in common use are the instant form and front form .",
    "each form is associated with a subgroup of the poincar group .",
    "this subgroup is considered to be free of interactions .",

    "all generators of the homogeneous lorentz group are free of interactions .",
