    "<S> [ r10:fig](a ) , the expansion of the confining potential leaves behind a density profile that has very strong density gradients close to the boundary of the initial confinement . since the latter ceases to act at @xmath83 , this leaves at @xmath84 instantaneously a region @xmath85 that is devoid of particles but in which the new external potential is essentially zero . </S>",

    "<S> the dynamics is much slower and the relaxation to the final plateau there takes place at the end of the process , causing thereby the final development of the new , weaker correlation peaks close to the location of the boundary , @xmath87 .    the compression process , depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ r10:fig](b ) runs very differently . </S>",
    "<S> there , the initial ` closing ' of the potential from @xmath88 to @xmath89 leaves at @xmath84 a region of high density at @xmath85 that now finds itself within a strongly repulsive external field . </S>",

    "<S> the occurrence of the two distinct time scales @xmath104 in the compression requires some explanation . </S>",
    "<S> the fast process that takes place at times @xmath105 corresponds to the abrupt shrinking of the profile at the wings of the distribution and is caused exclusively by the ` closing ' of the external field . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same mechanism that brings about the overshooting of the density peaks . </S>",
    "<S> once this is over , diffusion within the now already confined system takes place and the second characteristic time scale , @xmath106 , is solely determined by the interaction potential @xmath107 and the average particle density . in the expansion process , the first mechanism is absent thus a single time scale , @xmath108 , shows up , which is of intrinsic origin exclusively . since stronger density gradients occur during the compression than during the expansion process , even the larger of the two time scales of the compression , @xmath106 , is smaller than @xmath108 </S>",

    "<S> the results from theory and simulation are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ slab : fig ] . </S>",
    "<S> once more it can be seen that the ddft offers an excellent description of the dynamics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the same asymmetry between expansion and compression that was seen in the spherical confinement also shows up for the case of the slab , including the overshooting of the peaks during the compression process . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the density profiles develop during their evolution secondary oscillations that are also very well reproduced by the theory .    in summarising </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the dynamical density functional theory of marini bettolo marconi and tarazona @xcite , when supplemented by an accurate equilibrium density functional , can provide an excellent description of out - of - equilibrium dynamics of colloidal systems at the brownian time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the ddft formalism has already been successfully tested for the system of one - dimensional hard rods @xcite , for which the exact density functional @xmath0 $ ] is known . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first study of the validity of ddft in three dimensions . as the phenomenology in 3d is much richer than in 1d , including the possibility of phase transitions , many intersecting ways for future applications open up .    </S>",
