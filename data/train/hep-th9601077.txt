    "0.4 cm    it is a pleasure for me to speak on the occasion of the 60th birthday of my good friend , keiji kikkawa .",
    "i met keiji during my first visit to the aspen center for physics in the summer of 1969 .",
    "this was shortly after the appearance of the famous paper of kikkawa , sakita , and virasoro,@xcite which introduced the idea of regarding the dual resonance model @xmath4-point functions as the tree approximation of a unitary quantum theory , rather than just as interesting functions for use in phenomenology .",
    "this seemed very novel and exciting to me at the time . in aspen , keiji and",
    "i collaborated in a study of the regge asymptotic behavior of the ksv loop amplitudes.@xcite i found the experience so pleasant that i have returned to aspen almost every summer since then .",
    "many years later , after we had learned that the formulas of the earlier era described strings and were better suited to unfication than to hadrons , kikkawa and yamasaki discovered the `` t duality '' arising from compactification of closed string theories on a circle.@xcite this marked the beginning of a new line of attack on string theory that has proved to be extremely fruitful.@xcite t dualities are now recognized as a particular class of discrete dualities that are valid order - by - order in perturbation theory ( _ i.e. _ , they are perturbative ) , though t duality is non - perturbative on the world sheet . in my talk today i would like to describe two simple extensions of t duality in the context of `` m theory . ''",
    "( m theory is a conjectured quantum theory in eleven dimensions whose low - energy effective description is eleven - dimensional supergravity . )",
    "an interesting aspect of these extensions is that they incorporate some of the more modern non - perturbative duality symmetries .",
    "the basic results that i wish to describe are represented pictorially in fig .",
    "1 . this figure combines two well - known perturbative t dualities and two non - perturbative identifications .",
    "the perturbative t duality on the left side of the figure is between type iib superstring theory on a circle and type iia superstring theory on a circle of reciprocal radius.@xcite the perturbative t duality on the right side of the figure relates the @xmath5 heterotic string on a circle and the @xmath2 heterotic string on a circle of reciprocal radius.@xcite one",
    "non - perturbative fact is that the iia theory in ten dimensions actually has a circular eleventh dimension whose radius is proportional to the 2/3 power of the string coupling constant.@xcite another is that the @xmath6 heterotic theory in ten dimensions actually has an eleventh dimension that is a line segment i ( or , equivalently , a @xmath7 orbifold of a circle).@xcite the length of the line segment also scales as the 2/3 power of the string coupling constant .",
    "what i propose to do in this lecture is to by - pass the iia and @xmath6 theories and discuss the following two dualities : 1 ) the equivalence of m theory on a two - torus @xmath8 and iib superstring theory on a circle @xmath9 ; 2 ) the equivalence of m theory on a cylinder @xmath10 and @xmath2 superstring theory on a circle @xmath9 . in each case",
    "we will find that the area of the manifold @xmath8 and @xmath10 ( at fixed shape ) scales as the @xmath11 power of the size of the circle @xmath9 .",
    "the wrapping of all relevant @xmath12-branes on the compact spaces will be considered . by requiring a detailed matching of @xmath12-branes in each pair of dual theories",
    "we achieve numerous consistency tests of the overall picture and deduce relations among various @xmath12-brane tensions . the discussion of m / iib duality is a review of results reported previously,@xcite whereas the m/@xmath2 duality has not been presented previously .",
    "a useful technique for obtaining non - perturbative information about superstring theories and m theory is to identify their bps saturated @xmath12-branes .",
    "@xmath12-branes are @xmath12-dimensional objects that are characterized by a `` tension '' @xmath13 , which is the mass per unit @xmath12-volume ( and thus has dimensions of @xmath14 ) , and a suitable ( @xmath15)-dimensional world - volume theory . in theories with enough supersymmetry ( all supersymmetric theories in ten or eleven dimensions , in particular ) the tension of a @xmath12-brane carrying a suitable conserved charge has a strict lower bound proportional to that charge . when there is equality ( @xmath16 ) , the @xmath12-brane is said to be bps saturated .",
    "such @xmath12-branes belong to `` short '' representations of the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "so long as the supersymmetry is not broken , the tension of such a @xmath12-brane can not be changed by any quantum correction  perturbative or non - perturbative .",
    "this generalizes the well - known fact that the photon belongs to a `` short '' representation of the poincar group and must remain massless so long as gauge invariance remains unbroken .",
    "bps saturated @xmath12-branes of superstring theories or m theory can be approximated by classical solutions of the corresponding effective supergravity theory that preserve half of the supersymmetry .",
    "such solutions are not exact superstring solutions , of course , but they do demonstrate the existence of particular @xmath12-branes , give their tensions correctly , and exhibit other qualitatively correct properties . generally these objects can be regarded as extremal black @xmath12-branes , _ i.e. _ , extremal black holes @xmath17 , extremal black strings @xmath18 , etc . in solving the supergravity equations to obtain @xmath12-brane configurations",
    "it is sometimes necessary to include a source to match a delta function singularity in the equations .",
    "when the source is required , one often speaks of a `` fundamental @xmath12-brane '' and when it is nt of a `` solitonic @xmath12-brane .",
    "'' it will not be necessary for us to keep track of this distinction here , however .",
    "the conserved charges carried by @xmath12-branes are associated with antisymmetric tensor gauge fields @xmath19 when these undergo gauge transformations @xmath20 , the field strength @xmath21 is invariant .",
    "a supergravity theory with such a gauge field typically has two kinds of bps - saturated @xmath12-brane solutions .",
    "the electric @xmath12-brane has @xmath22 and the dual magnetic @xmath12-brane has @xmath23 .",
    "when it is possible to reformulate the supergravity theory in terms of a dual potential @xmath24 ( satisfying @xmath25 plus possible interaction corrections ) there is no essential distinction between `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' @xmath12-branes .",
    "the two are interchanged in the dual formulation . in the case of an electric @xmath12-brane , the gauge field couples to the @xmath12-brane world volume generalizing the well - known @xmath26 interaction of charged point particles .",
    "it is also worth noting that the charges of dual electric and magnetic @xmath12-branes satisfy a generalized dirac quantization condition @xmath27.@xcite    let us now consider specific examples , beginning with type iib supergravity theory .",
    "this theory contains a complex scalar field @xmath28 , and so the specification of a vacuum is characterized by the modulus @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the string coupling constant .",
    "( note that the analogous formula for @xmath31 theories in four dimensions has @xmath32 . )",
    "the @xmath33 duality group of type iib superstring theory is an @xmath34 under which @xmath35 transforms nonlinearly in the usual way .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 may be restricted to the usual fundamental region .",
    "the iib theory also has a pair of two - form potentials @xmath37 that transform as a doublet of the @xmath34 duality group .",
    "therefore , the associated electric one - branes ( strings ) carry a pair of @xmath38 charges . suitably normalized",
    ", they can be chosen to be a pair of relatively prime integers ( @xmath39 ) . setting @xmath40 ( to keep things simple ) , the tensions ( in the iib string metric ) are  @xcite @xmath41 in the canonical metric @xmath42 is a constant , and thus @xmath43 in the string metric .",
    "note that in the string metric only @xmath44 is finite as @xmath45 .",
    "therefore it is natural to regard it as the fundamental string and the others as solitons , though they are all mapped into one another by the duality group .",
    "the dual five - branes carry a pair of magnetic @xmath38 charges .",
    "the iib theory also contains a four - form potential @xmath46 with a self - dual field strength @xmath47 . as a result ,",
    "electric and magnetic charge are identified in this case and carried by a self - dual three - brane .",
    "the m theory story is somewhat simpler , since the only antisymmetric tensor gauge field in eleven - dimensional supergravity is a three - form @xmath48 .",
    "there are associated electric two - brane and magnetic five - brane solutions .",
    "it is apparently not possible to replace @xmath48 by a dual six - form potential , so the electric  magnetic distinction is meaningful in this case .",
    "( the two - brane is `` fundamental '' and the five - brane is `` solitonic '' in the sense described earlier . )    in the case of type i or heterotic strings the relevant low - energy theory is @xmath49 @xmath50 supergravity coupled to an @xmath6 or @xmath2 super yang ",
    "mills multiplet . in this case",
    "the relevant antisymmetric tensor is a two - form @xmath51 .",
    "the associated electric one - brane is the heterotic string .",
    "there is also a five - brane , which is the magnetic dual of the heterotic string .",
    "type i strings do not carry a conserved charge , they are not bps saturated , and therefore they can break . for these reasons",
    ", they can only be described reliably at weak coupling when they are metastable .",
    "now that we have described the relevant theories and their @xmath12-branes we can turn to the duality analysis .",
    "the duality described by the left side of figure 1 relates m theory compactified on a two - torus and iib superstring theory compactified on a circle .",
    "the torus is described by its area @xmath52 ( in the canonical eleven - dimensional metric ) and a modular parameter @xmath53 , which may be taken to lie in the fundamental region of the @xmath34 modular group .",
    "the corresponding parameters of the iib theory are the modulus @xmath36 and the circumference of the circle @xmath54 ( in the canonical ten - dimensional metric , which is the one that is invariant under @xmath34 transformations ) . to test the equivalence of these two constructions",
    ", we will examine the matching of all @xmath12-branes in nine dimensions .",
    "these include various wrappings of the ones identified in the preceding section as well as new @xmath12-branes that arise by kaluza  klein mechanisms .",
    "the possible @xmath12-brane wrappings are depicted in figure 2 .",
    "as the figure shows , @xmath12-branes , for any @xmath12 between 0 and 5 , can be obtained by suitable wrapping of a @xmath55-brane in either m theory or iib theory .",
    "the identifications are straightforward for @xmath56 .",
    "they also work for @xmath57 , but one must be careful to take account of kaluza ",
    "klein effects in these cases .",
    "( the kaluza ",
    "klein vector fields in nine dimensions  arising due to isometries  support additional electric zero - branes and magnetic five - branes . )",
    "when the matching is done correctly , one finds a one - to - one correspondence of @xmath12-branes and their tensions in nine dimensions .",
    "the details have been worked out previously.@xcite here , i will simply state the results and discuss their implications .    the most important result , perhaps , is that one must make the identification  @xcite @xmath58 thus , the geometric @xmath34 modular group of the torus is identified with the non - perturbative @xmath33-duality group of the iib theory !",
    "the canonical metrics @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related ( after the compactifications ) by @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is the m theory two - brane tension .",
    "both @xmath62 and @xmath42 ( introduced earlier ) are constants that define scales and can be set to unity without loss of generality , though i will not do that . in terms of these constants ,",
    "the compactification scales @xmath52 and @xmath54 are related by @xmath63 thus , @xmath64 .",
    "this means that if one compactifies the iib theory on a circle and lets the size of the circle vanish , while holding @xmath36 fixed , one ends up with m theory in eleven dimensions !",
    "conversely , if one compactifies the m theory on a torus and lets the torus shrink to zero at fixed shape , one ends up with a chiral theory ",
    "iib superstring theory  in ten dimensions .",
    "the matching of @xmath12-branes and their tensions also yields a number of relations among the tensions .",
    "not only does one learn the relation between m and iib tensions in eq .",
    "( [ between ] ) , but also relations among the tensions of the m and iib theories separately . for the m theory",
    ", one learns that the five - brane tension is proportional to the square of the two - brane tension @xmath65 this formula implies that the product of electric and magnetic charges is the minimum value allowed by the quantization condition.@xcite for the @xmath12-branes of the iib theory one finds that all of their tensions can be expressed in terms of @xmath42 and the moduli @xmath66",
    "@xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 equations ( [ withtheta ] ) and ( [ yestheta ] ) generalize eq .",
    "( [ notheta ] ) to include @xmath70 .",
    "note that the tension of all rr @xmath12-branes @xmath71 in the string metric , as expected for d - branes.@xcite    a number of amusing things are taking place in the @xmath12-brane matchings that gave these relations .",
    "let me just mention one of them . in matching zero - branes",
    "there is a duality between the m theory two - brane and the iib strings that works as follows:@xcite the kaluza ",
    "klein excitations of the strings on a circle correspond to wrappings of the two - brane on the torus .",
    "conversely , the wrappings of the @xmath34 family of strings on the circle correspond to the kaluza  klein excitations of the membrane on the torus .",
    "let us pause for a moment to consider the physical meaning of what we have shown .",
    "the claim is that m theory on @xmath8 is the same thing as iib theory on @xmath9 .",
    "if one considers the common nine - dimensional theory , one might imagine asking the question `` how many compact dimensions are there ? ''",
    "this question has two correct answers  one and two  depending on whether one thinks of m theory or iib theory .",
    "this paradoxical situation has a simple resolution .",
    "fields that describe `` matter '' in one picture can describe `` metric '' in the other and vice versa .",
    "this situation already occurs for more conventional t duality  say , for the heterotic string on a torus . in that case",
    "the duality mixes up internal components of the metric with those of the two - forms and @xmath72 gauge fields .",
    "what is new in the present case is that  ( i ) the dual compact spaces have different dimensions ,  ( ii ) certain components of the iib theory metric correspond to components of the three - form gauge field in m theory ,  ( iii ) certain components of the m theory metric correspond to the complex scalar @xmath35 of the iib theory . despite these differences of detail ,",
    "the basic concept is the same . another important distinction , of course , is that the generalization of t duality considered here encodes non - perturbative features of the theory .",
    "let us now consider the duality depicted in the right - hand portion of figure 1 .",
    "this is the equivalence of m theory compactified on a cylinder with @xmath2 superstring theory compactified on a circle .",
    "note that we do not specify whether the @xmath2 theory is type i or heterotic .",
    "the reason , of course , is that they are different descriptions of a single theory,@xcite so it is both of them .",
    "the dilaton in one description is the negative of the dilaton in the other , and so the coupling constants are related by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 represents @xmath2 , @xmath75 represents heterotic , and @xmath76 represents type i.    recall that the @xmath2 theory has two bps saturated @xmath12-branes : the heterotic string and its magnetic dual , which is a five - brane .",
    "as discussed earlier , the type i string is not bps saturated and will not be considered in our analysis .",
    "the @xmath12-branes arising from compactification on a circle are straightforward to work out and are depicted in figure 3 . as in section 3 , one should also be careful to include @xmath12-branes of kaluza  klein origin .",
    "m theory , before compactification , has a two - brane and a five - brane , but new issues arise when one considers compactification on a manifold with boundaries , and so we must first get that straight . consider first the horava ",
    "witten picture  @xcite  m theory on @xmath77 , an eleven - dimensional space - time with two parallel ten - dimensional boundaries .",
    "this is the non - perturbative description of the @xmath5 heterotic string , just as m theory on @xmath78 describes the type iia superstring .",
    "we know that @xmath6 theory , regarded as ten - dimensional has a one - brane ( the heterotic string ) and a dual five - brane .",
    "so we must ask what these look like in eleven dimensions .",
    "there is only one sensible possibility .",
    "an @xmath6 heterotic `` string '' is really a cylindrical two - brane with one boundary attached to each boundary of the space time .",
    "thus , an @xmath6 heterotic string can be viewed as a ribbon with one @xmath79 gauge group living on each boundary .",
    "this seems to be the only allowed two - brane configuration , since any other would give rise to a two - brane that remains two - dimensional in the weak coupling limit in which the space - time boundaries approach one another .",
    "for the five - brane , the story is just the reverse .",
    "it must not terminate on the space - time boundaries , but can exist as a closed surface in the bulk .",
    "this is required so that it can give a five - brane and not a four - brane in the weak coupling limit .",
    "subsequent reduction on a circle to nine dimensions gives the wrapping possibilities depicted in figure 3 .",
    "the cylinder @xmath10 has a height @xmath80 and a circumference @xmath81 .",
    "these are convenently combined to give an area @xmath82 and a shape ratio @xmath83 .",
    "the circumference of the circle for the @xmath2 theory compactification is denoted @xmath84 ( in the heterotic string metric ) .",
    "also , the @xmath12-brane tensions of the @xmath2 theory are denoted @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "now , guided by figure 3 , we again match @xmath12-branes in nine dimensions , just as we did in the previous section .",
    "one finds that the analog of the identification @xmath87 is @xmath88 this means that when the spatial cylinder is a thin ribbon @xmath89 the heterotic string is weakly coupled , whereas when it is a thin tube @xmath90 , the type i string is weakly coupled .",
    "the analog of eq .",
    "( [ between ] ) is @xmath91 aside from the factor of @xmath92 the equations look the same . as before , for fixed @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 theory in ten dimensions can be obtained by shrinking the cylinder to a point .    as in section 3 , the @xmath12-brane matching in nine dimensions gives various tension relations .",
    "the only new one is @xmath94 combining eqs .",
    "( [ sigmaeqn ] ) and ( [ t5eqn ] ) , one learns that in the heterotic string metric , where @xmath85 is constant , @xmath95 , as expected for a soliton . on the other hand , in the type",
    "i string metric @xmath96 and @xmath97 , as expected for @xmath98-branes.@xcite    in the case of m / iib duality we found that the @xmath34 modular group of the torus corresponded to the @xmath33-duality group of the iib theory . in the present case of m/@xmath2 duality",
    ", the cylinder does not have an analogous modular group .",
    "however , the interchange @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) corresponds to the strong / weak duality transformation of the @xmath2 theory that relates the perturbative heterotic limit to the perturbative type i limit .",
    "on several occasions keiji kikkawa has pioneered concepts that have led to important advances in string theory .",
    "the lessons of t duality are still being learned . in particular",
    ", the generalization of t duality to m theory described here exhibits the non - perturbative equivalence of all known superstring theories , realizing a dream i have had for many years .",
    "other generalizations of t duality have been found,@xcite and there may still be more to come .",
    "we owe keiji a debt of gratitude for pointing us in this direction ."
