    "tides play an important role in binary star systems and in star - planet systems . while numerous studies of tidal effects have been based on the so - called equilibrium tide theory , which parametrizes tidal dissipation by an effective tidal lag angle / time or tidal quality factor ( e.g. , darwin 1880 ; goldreich & soter 1966 ; alexander 1973 ; hut 1981 ) , the underlying physics of tides in fluid stars and planets involves dynamical excitations of waves and oscillations by the tidal force ( see ogilvie & lin 2007 and zahn 2008 for recent reviews ) .",
    "tides in highly eccentric systems are particularly rich in their dynamical behavior , since wave modes with a wide range of frequencies can be excited and participate in the tidal interaction .",
    "various aspects of dynamical tides in eccentric binaries have been studied by lai ( 1996,1997 ) , kumar & quataert ( 1998 ) , witte & savonije ( 1999,2001 ) , willems et al .",

    "recent observations of the binary star system hd 187091 ( koi-54 ) by the _ kepler _ satellite provide a unique opportunity for studying dynamical tides in eccentric binaries .",
    "koi-54 consists of two a stars ( mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 ) in an eccentric ( @xmath4 ) orbit with period @xmath5  days ( welsh et al .",
    "the binary is nearly face - on with orbital inclination @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to periodic brightening events caused by tidal distortion and irradiation of the two stars during their close periastron passages , the power spectrum of the _ kepler _ light curve revealed 30 significant ( with a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath7 ) stellar pulsation modes . the observed mode periods range from 45  hours to 11 hours , corresponding to the mode frequency @xmath8 ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the orbital frequency ) .",
    "most interestingly , twenty - one of these mode frequencies are integer multiples of @xmath12 ( with the ratio @xmath13 differing from an integer by @xmath14 or less ) .",
    "the two dominant modes have frequencies that are exactly 90 and 91 times @xmath12 , with the corresponding flux amplitudes of 297.7  @xmath15mag and 229.4  @xmath15mag , respectively .    while dynamical tides in massive - star binaries have been studied before ( e.g. , zahn 1977 , goldreich & nicholson 1989 for circular binaries ; lai 1996,1997 , kumar & quataert 1998 and witte & savonije 1999,2011 for eccentric binaries ) , koi-54 represents the first example where tidally excited oscillations are directly observed and therefore serves as an explict demonstration of dynamical tides at work in the system . as discussed in welsh et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the observed oscillation modes are puzzling : over 20 of the observed modes are nearly exact integer multiples of the orbital frequency , yet several others are not .",
    "it is not clear why the dominant modes are so prominent , e.g. , why modes with frequencies 90 , 91 , 44 , and 40 times @xmath16 are clearly visible , and yet modes with frequencies greater than @xmath17 and those less than @xmath18 appear to be absent .    the goal of this paper is to explain some of the observational puzzles related to koi-54 and to develop the general theoretical framework for studying tidally - excited oscillations in eccentric binary systems .    our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we derive the general equations for calculating the energies of tidally excited oscillation modes in an eccentric binary .",
    "our theory improves upon previous ( and less rigorous ) works , and provides a clear relationship between the resonant mode energy and non - resonant mode energy . in section 3",
    "we study the properties of non - radial g - modes relevant to the stars in the koi-54 system and calculate the non - resonant mode energies  these serve as a benchmark for examining the effect of resonances . in section 4",
    "we present our calculations of the flux variation due to tidally - forced oscillations .",
    "we show that the observed flux variation in koi-54 can be largely explained when a high - frequency mode is locked into resonance ( with the mode frequency equal to @xmath19 ) . in section 5",
    "we study the possibility of resonance locking .",
    "we show that the combination of the secular tidal orbital / spin evolution and the intrinsic spindown of the star ( e.g. , due to stellar evolution ) may naturally lead to resonance locking of a particular mode .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that ( in the koi-54 system ) a mode with frequency around @xmath19 can be resonantly locked , while modes with higher frequencies can not . in section 6",

    "the spin frequency is @xmath273 , and the two modes have @xmath274 and @xmath275 ( i.e. , both are initially `` off - resonance '' ) .",
    "we see that the stellar spindown first causes @xmath265 to lock into resonance at @xmath276 .",
    "the star then spins up , driven by the resonant tidal torque .",
    "the second mode passes through the @xmath158 resonance , but it produces a negligible effect on the @xmath276 resonance . in the meantime , the orbit decays , reducing @xmath202 .",
    "when @xmath202 becomes less than @xmath277 , the resonance locking can no longer be maintained , and @xmath265 breaks away from the @xmath278 resonance .",
    "the stellar spin then decreases ( due to the @xmath279 term ) , which leads to @xmath266 to capture into the @xmath158 resonance . eventually , as @xmath202 decreases ( due the resonant tidal torque ) below @xmath280 , the second mode breaks away from the @xmath158 resonance .",
    "this example corroborates our analytical result of section 5.3 , and demonstrates that resonance locking can indeed be achieved and maintained for an extended period during the evolution of the binary system .",
    "having demonstrated how resonance locking can occur in a simplified system consisting of only two oscillation modes , we now investigate how resonance locking is likely to occur in the actual koi-54 system .",

    "we use initial values of @xmath285 ( here @xmath286 is the observed orbital frequency of koi-54 ) , @xmath287 , @xmath288 , and a spindown time of @xmath289 years . in figure",
    "[ evolution2 ] , we have doubled the orbital decay rate to account for an equal amount of energy dissipation in the companion star .",
    "let us start by examining figure [ evolution ] .",
    "the system quickly enters a resonance locking state with the @xmath290 mode , where the notation @xmath291 identifies the mode with the @xmath55th largest frequency in our simulation with azimuthal number @xmath41 .",
    "the resonance locking lasts for over 100 million years , until the @xmath292 mode reaches resonance .",
    "the @xmath292 mode then locks in resonance for over 100 million years . during resonance",
    "locking , the orbital frequency and spin frequency increase rapidly .",
    "the energies @xmath68 of the resonant locked modes can exceed @xmath293 their non - resonant values @xmath60 , corresponding to an increase in visibility of over 25 times the visibility during a non - resonant state .",
    "when no mode is locked in resonance , the orbital evolution is relatively slow , with the dominant effect being the spindown of the star due to the @xmath294 term .        for the initial conditions and orbital evolution depicted in figure [ evolution ] , only two of our 18 modes pass through resonant locking phases : two @xmath0 modes with initial frequencies of @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "the highest frequency @xmath0 mode included in our evolution does not lock in resonance because it has @xmath207 at all times .",
    "the lowest frequency modes do not lock in resonance because they do not satisfy equation ( [ saturation ] ) , i.e. , they become saturated before they can begin to resonantly lock .",
    "this occurs because the value of @xmath50 for these high - order modes is small , resulting in a small orbital decay rate @xmath297 for these modes .",
    "which mode locks into resonance is dependent on the initial conditions .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure [ evolution ] , the resonance with the @xmath292 mode ends the resonance with the @xmath290 mode because the @xmath292 mode has a larger value of @xmath298 and will thus dominate the orbital decay .",
    "therefore , we can expect the system to evolve into a state in which the mode with the largest value of @xmath68 ( and with @xmath209 ) is locked in resonance .    in figure [ evolution ] , the resonance locking with the @xmath292 mode is ended by a resonance with the @xmath299 mode .",
    "the @xmath299 mode does not lock into resonance because an @xmath1 mode can not change the stellar spin frequency .",
    "however , its resonance causes the value of @xmath300 to exceed the value of @xmath301 for the locked mode , so that the system sweeps through the resonance .",
    "in other words , the non - locked resonant mode temporarily decreases the value of @xmath180 , decreasing the value of @xmath232 such that resonant saturation occurs for the locked mode , causing it to pass through resonance .",
    "also note that even though the @xmath299 mode does not lock into resonance , it maintains a relatively large energy ( @xmath302 ) for a period of over 50 million years .",
    "this is indicative of the pseudo - resonance locking for @xmath1 modes described in section [ m0 ] .",
    "let us now examine figure [ evolution2 ] , in which the orbital decay rate has been doubled ( i.e. , we multiply @xmath303 by 2 ) to account for an equal tidal response in the companion star .",
    "the results are significantly different : due to the increased orbital decay rate , the initial effective value of @xmath258 has dropped to @xmath304 ( see section 5.3.3 ) so that the @xmath292 mode can no longer lock into resonance .",
    "also , the maximum energy @xmath305 of the modes is larger in this scenario ( because the modes must enter deeper into resonance to become locked ) , so the modes can create larger magnitude variations while being locked in resonance .    however , the resonance locking events are shorter because the modes are nearly saturated during resonance locking , allowing resonances with @xmath1 modes or higher frequency @xmath0 modes to easily disrupt the resonance locking state . in the bottom",
    "three panels of figure [ evolution2 ] , we have plotted the energy @xmath68 of the @xmath306 mode . in figure",
    "[ evolution2 ] , three of the resonant locking events for the @xmath290 mode are ended due to a resonance with the @xmath306 mode .",
    "we have examined the results carefully and found that all of the resonance locking events were ended due a resonance with an @xmath1 mode or an @xmath0 mode for which @xmath207 .",
    "although the resonance locking events are brief at the end of the simulation , the locking event with the @xmath307 mode lasts for about 20 million years at the beginning of the simulation when the system s parameters most closely resemble those of koi-54 .",
    "we thus conclude it is likely to observe a system such as koi-54 in a resonance locking state .",
    "we note the secular evolution analysis presented above does not take into account the fluctuation of mode amplitudes due to the changing strength of the tidal potential in an elliptical orbit .",
    "therefore , in addition to the results displayed above , we have also performed calculations of the full dynamic evolution of the stellar oscillations and binary orbit , including the back - reaction of the modes on the orbit .",
    "we find that resonance locking can indeed be maintained for extended periods of time , and that non - secular effects have little impact on the results discussed above .",
    "as discussed in section 4 , in the linear theory , tidally - forced stellar oscillations give rise to flux variations at integer multiples of the orbital frequency .",
    "many of these oscillations have been observed in the koi-54 system .",
    "however , welsh et al . ( 2011 ) also reported the detection of nine modes that do not have frequencies that are integer multiples of the orbital period , and their observation requires an explanation .",
    "one possibility is that one ( or both ) of the stars in koi-54 are @xmath308-scuti variable stars .",
    "the masses , ages , and metallicities of the koi-54 stars put them directly in the instability strip and so @xmath308-scuti - type pulsations are not unexpected .",
    "however , as pointed out by welsh et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the complete absence of any modes detected with periods less than 11 hours is troublesome for the @xmath308-scuti interpretation , as most observed @xmath308-scuti pulsations have periods on the order of a few hours . one",
    "would then have to explain why only long period ( @xmath309 hours ) @xmath308-scuti - type oscillations are visible in this system .",
    "another possibility is that some ( or all ) of the non - harmonic modes are excited via nonlinear couplings with resonant modes . in particular",
    ", it is thought that three - mode resonant coupling ( parametric resonance ) plays an important role in limiting the saturation amplitudes of overstable g - modes in zz - ceti stars ( wu & goldreich 2001 ) and @xmath308-scuti stars ( dziembowski & krolikowska 1985 ) . in the koi-54 system ,",
    "when a resonantly excited mode reaches sufficiently large amplitude , it will couple to two non - resonant , lower - frequency daughter modes ( see kumar & goodman 1996 ) , thereby explaining the observed non - harmonic oscillations .",
    "parametric resonance can occur when @xmath310 , where @xmath311 is the frequency of the parent mode and @xmath35 and @xmath312 are the frequencies of the two daughter modes .",
    "the additional requirement that @xmath313 , where @xmath41 is the azimuthal number of the mode , implies that @xmath314 .",
    "examination of the koi-54 data given in welsh et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reveals that @xmath315 ( 25.195 @xmath15hz = 6.207 @xmath15hz + 18.988 @xmath15hz ) exactly to the precision of the measurements , where @xmath316 is the frequency of the magnitude oscillation with the @xmath317th largest magnitude variation .",
    "this provides strong evidence that the @xmath318 and @xmath319 oscillations are due to modes excited via parametric resonance and not via direct tidal forcing .",
    "however , no other pair of observed non - harmonic magnitude oscillations have frequencies which add up to that of an observed oscillation .",
    "some of these non - resonant oscillations may be due to modes excited via parametric resonance that have undetected sister modes .",
    "this possibility is especially appealing if one considers the scenario in which one of the two daughter modes has @xmath1 ( and could thus be easily detected for small values of @xmath90 ) , while its sibling has @xmath0 ( and is thus very difficult to detect for small @xmath90 ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that all non - harmonic flux oscillations are produced by nonlinear mode coupling . deeper observations",
    "( with better photometry ) and analysis may reveal additional evidence for nonlinear mode couplings in the koi-54 system",
    "we have shown that many properties of flux oscillations detected in the koi-54 binary system by _ kepler _ can be understood using the theory of dynamical tidal excitations of g - modes developed in this paper .",
    "in particular , our analysis and calculation of the resonance mode locking process , which is driven by dynamical tides and intrinsic stellar spindown , provides a natural explanation for the fact that only those modes with frequencies ( @xmath102 ) less than about 90 - 100 times the orbital frequency ( @xmath81 ) are observed .",
    "our result suggests that the koi-54 system is currently in a resonance - locking state in which one of the stars has a rotation rate such that it possesses a @xmath0 mode with frequency @xmath320 and the other star has a similar mode with @xmath321  these modes produce the largest flux variations detected in koi-54 .",
    "our analysis shows that the system can evolve into and stay in such a resonance locking state for relatively long time periods , and it is reasonable to observe the system in such a state .",
    "other less prominent flux variations at lower frequencies can be explained by the @xmath1 tidally forced oscillations , many of which may be enhanced by the resonant effect .",
    "we have also found evidence of nonlinear three - mode coupling from the published _",
    "kepler _ data and suggested that the nonlinear effect may explain the flux variabilities at non - harmonic frequencies .    in our study ,",
    "we have used approximate quasiadiabatic mode damping rates .",
    "obviously , it would be useful to repeat our analysis using more realistic mode damping rates , calculated with the full non - adiabatic oscillation equations .",
    "our calculations of the flux variations of tidally induced oscillations have also highlighted the importance of accurate treatment of non - adiabatic effects in the stellar photosphere .",
    "we have only considered g - modes ( modified by stellar rotation ) in this paper .",
    "our general theory allows for other rotation - driven modes , such as inertial / rossby modes . it would be interesting to study tidal excitations of these modes as well as the nonlinear 3-mode coupling effect in the future .",
    "more detailed modelling of the observed oscillations may provide useful constraints on the parameters of the koi-54 system , particularly the stellar rotation rates and spin inclinations . on a more general level",
    ", koi-54 may serve as a `` laboratory '' for calibrating theory of dynamical tides , which has wide applications in stellar and planetary astrophysics ( see references in section 1 ) .    while we believe that our current theory provides the basis for understanding many aspects of the koi-54 observations , some puzzles remain . in our current interpretation",
    ", the most prominent oscillations ( at @xmath322 and @xmath323 ) occur in the two different stars , each having a @xmath0 mode resonantly locked with the orbit . while one can certainly appeal to coincidence ,",
    "it is intriguing that the strongest observed oscillations are at the two consecutive harmonics ( @xmath324 ) of the orbital frequency .",
    "more importantly , as discussed in section 5.3.3 , when both stars are involved in resonance locking , the effective @xmath202 ( above which resonance locking can not happen ) is reduced .",
    "for example , using our canonical stellar parameters ( @xmath205 ) , we find @xmath325 [ see equation ( [ nc2 ] ) ] , but the effective @xmath202 would be reduced to @xmath326 if the two stars have identical modes in resonance locking . in the case where the resonant energy dissipation rates in the two stars differ by a factor of more than a few , the effective @xmath202 of one star would remain close to 131 , while the effective @xmath202 for the other star would likely be reduced to a value below 90 . in this case",
    ", it would be unlikely to find the binary system in the resonance - locking state involving both stars with @xmath327 close to 90 , because it is most likely for modes with @xmath67 just less than @xmath202 to be locked in resonance ( see section 5.4.2 . ) .",
    "thus , we find it likely that the energy dissipation rates are nearly equal ( to within a factor of 2 ) in each star in the koi-54 system .",
    "finally , we may use our results to speculate on the evolutionary history ( and future ) of the koi-54 system .",

    ", the stars will continue to expand into red giants and the spindown time scale will decrease .",

    "carried out non - adiabatic mode calculations and also attribute most of the oscillations to @xmath1 modes , although they do not reach a definite conclusion on the source of the @xmath167 oscillations .",
    "they did not consider resonance locking ( instead they consider the qualitatively different phenomenon of pseudosynchronous locks \" ) , and appeared to attribute all resonances to random chance .",
    "they also showed that 3-mode coupling ( see section 6 ) is possible .",
