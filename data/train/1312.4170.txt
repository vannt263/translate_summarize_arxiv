    "interpretation of x - ray and sz observations of clusters of galaxies is subject to a number of uncertainties .",
    "the nature of many ( but not all ) of these uncertainties are related to the physical state of the icm , for example to the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium or symmetries in the icm distribution , the role of non - thermal pressure , abundance distributions of elements etc .",
    "many of these uncertainties have been extensively discussed and are taken into account by sophisticated data interpretation procedures ( e.g. @xcite ) . however ,",
    "the effects of possible non - solar abundance distributions of elements remained so far largely ignored .",
    "diagnostics of element abundances in the icm is based on measurement of their line emission , which , given the characteristic icm temperatures , is in the x - ray band .",
    "this works reasonably well in principle for most of the cosmically abundant elements .",
    "however , x - ray spectroscopy provides no information on the helium - to - hydrogen ratio in the icm , because both elements are fully ionized at these temperatures and produce no spectral lines .",
    "therefore in practice , the helium abundance is usually assumed to be equal to its primordial value .",
    "the latter is known quite accurately from the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis which predicts the he fraction in the total baryonic mass density of @xcite .",

    "an incorrect assumption about helium abundance in interpreting observations of clusters of galaxies will lead to several important consequences .",
    "firstly , the incorrect calculation of the continuum level , per particle , will result in an incorrect measurement of the metal abundances and emission measures by means of x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "that in turn will result in incorrect estimates of the gravitating and gas masses of the cluster @xcite .",
    "secondly , incorrectly assumed helium abundance will affect the results of angular distance measurements based on x - ray and microwave observations @xcite .",

    "in particular , the effect of thermal diffusion was not taken into account .",
    "the importance of the latter in considering cool - core clusters has been demonstrated by @xcite . in particular , it was shown that the temperature gradients in cool - core clusters are large enough for thermal diffusion to counteract gravitational sedimentation and to reverse the flow of heavy particles , resulting in the effective removal of helium and metals from the cluster inner core .    the goal of the present paper is to consider the full set of burgers equations for a multi - component icm plasma in order to estimate the maximum possible impact of diffusion of elements in the icm on the interpretation of x - ray and microwave observations of clusters of galaxies . in the following",

    ", we carried out the following simulations . using the vapec model @xcite in xspec @xcite , we generated x - ray spectra for different gas temperatures , fixing the abundances of heavy elements to their solar values and varying the helium abundance from 0.1 to 2 in solar abundance units . in running the fakeit command in xspec",
    "we do not use the counting statistics in order to exclude noise from the simulations . as the fakeit command still assigns the formal statistical errors to the simulated spectrum , the subsequent fitting of the simulated spectrum",

    "replacing the chandra response function with that of xmm - newton epic mos has practically no effect on this result .",
    "hence , the error in the helium abundance assumption does not significantly affect the determination of gas temperature .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the inferred gas temperature is determined by the shape of the spectral continuum and relative intensities of spectral lines .",
    "changing the helium abundance affects the continuum shape only slightly because the energy dependence of the gaunt factor weakly varies with the ion charge @xmath26 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so that hydrogen and helium have only slightly different shapes of bremsstrahlung spectra .    in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "the goal of this exercise was to estimate the maximal effect that diffusion can have on various cosmologically important measurements with clusters of galaxies .",
    "diffusion of elements is driven by the force of gravity and by density and temperature gradients .",

    "the hydrogen and helium are assumed to be fully ionized . in all of the calculations presented here , the heavy element is fe@xmath63 . as was demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "adding other heavy ions does not lead to noticeable differences in the diffusion picture , moreover , distributions of all metals change in an approximately identical manner .",
    "2 .   we use a spherical model of a cluster in hydrostatic equilibrium . because of the non - negligible helium abundance",
    ", diffusion changes the total pressure : @xmath64 , hence hydrostatic equilibrium is violated and a net flow of particles appears .",
    "however , because the sound speed in the icm is much higher than the diffusion velocity , hydrostatic equilibrium restores quickly and stationary burger s equations remain valid .",
    "the ( small ) net flow velocity is calculated using the euler equation .",
    "all velocities , temperature and density gradients are required to vanish at the inner point @xmath65 . at the outer boundary , a constant density boundary condition is set .",

    "the cluster outer boundary is located at a distance of @xmath66 kpc from the cluster center .",
    "we have verified that the solution in the inner regions of the cluster is insensitive to this condition ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we also considered the case of an opaque boundary condition by setting the speeds of all species equal to zero at the outer boundary .",
    "the resulting solution at @xmath67 gyr differs by less than a few per cent from the solution for our default boundary conditions almost everywhere out to a radial distance of @xmath68 kpc .",

    "the temperature profile is fixed , @xmath69 , and heat transport in the plasma is switched off , i.e. there is no heat flux term in our equations .",

    "positive velocity corresponds to outflow and negative to inflow .    in the central 20  kpc region of a2029 ,",
    "helium and iron have positive velocities and only hydrogen flows towards the cluster center .",
    "such behavior is caused by the large temperature gradient in the central part of the cluster ( from the center to @xmath82  kpc , fig .",
    "[ figa2029 ] ) .",
    "thermal diffusion tends to evacuate heavy elements from the cool core , counteracting gravity . on",
    "the other hand , the outward decrease of temperature beyond @xmath83  kpc acts in the same direction as gravitational sedimentation and increases the diffusion velocity as compared to isothermal cluster models .",
    "[ figabund ] shows the accumulated effect of the diffusion after 3 and 7 gyr .",
    "after 7 gyrs , the thermal diffusion completely removes iron from the central part of a2029 .",
    "the same is true for helium , albeit to somewhat lesser extent .",
    "the combined effect of gravitational sedimentation and thermal diffusion increases the concentration of both elements at @xmath84@xmath85 kpc from the cluster center .",
    "the hydrogen distribution changes in the opposite sense , in order to keep hydrostatic equilibrium . as a result , complex abundance distributions of elements are formed .",
    "the particular shape of these distributions is determined by the detailed shape of the temperature profile , as the net diffusion velocity depends on the amplitude of the temperature gradients .",
    "although the temperature profiles vary significantly from cluster to cluster , a picture qualitatively similar to that for a2029 arises for other cool - core clusters : the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen is suppressed in the cluster center and peaks at intermediate radii , @xmath86 few hundred kpc , due to the combined effect of thermal diffusion and gravitational separation ( see @xcite for a few other examples ) .    for the isothermal cluster model ,",
    "the gravitational sedimentation modifies the element distributions in a more monotonic fashion , increasing their concentrations towards the cluster center . as demonstrated in previous work",
    "@xcite , the enhancement is most significant for helium and is somewhat smaller for iron and other metals .",
    "in particular , the helium concentration in the cluster center can increase by up to a factor of @xmath87@xmath88 after @xmath88@xmath6 gyrs . because of the factor of @xmath89@xmath88 decrease of the hydrogen concentration in the center , the increase in the helium abundance is larger and can achieve a factor of @xmath3@xmath90 .",
    "as the diffusion velocity depends on temperature as @xmath91 , the effect is stronger for higher temperature clusters .",
    "both theory and cosmological simulations predict that the temperature profiles of clusters should become similar when radii are scaled to the cluster virial radius ( for a detailed discussion see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a prominent feature of the predicted and observed temperature profiles is that the icm temperature decreases outwards in the outer regions of clusters , beyond several hundred kpc .",
    "as was demonstrated in the previous sections , the combined effect of gravitation sedimentation and thermal diffusion will lead to inflow of elements heavier than hydrogen and outflow of hydrogen through the outer boundary of the cluster of galaxies .",
    "this will result in a long - term increase of the cluster - averaged abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen .",

    "[ figdvel ] ) .",
    "hence , the initial mass flow rates are @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 /year , where positive sign means that the total mass of the given element in the cluster is increasing .",
    "thus , at the time @xmath107 the abundances will be increasing at rates of : @xmath108 in the isothermal cluster model , these rates are correspondingly smaller .    the detailed long - term evolution of the cluster - averaged abundances computed from results of our numerical calculations is shown in fig .  [ fig : abund ] .",
    "after 7  gyr , 4.5% of the hydrogen initially present in the cluster will have outflow through the outer boundary , whereas the total masses of helium and iron in the icm will have increased by 28% and 22% , respectively .",
    "this will result in an increase of their cluster - averaged abundances by 33% and 27% , respectively .",
    "for the isothermal cluster ( @xmath109 kev ) , the cluster - averaged abundances of helium and iron will have increased by 19 and 11% , respectively , after 7 gyr .",
    "due to outflow of hydrogen and inflow of helium and heavier elements through the outer boundary of the cluster , the mean molecular weight of the icm increases with time .",
    "we note that due to our assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium at @xmath98 , there is no net mass flow through the outer boundary at the initial moment .",
    "once diffusion starts to operate , the total pressure changes and the gas is pushed out of the equilibrium which is restored via net gas motion . as a result , there is net inflow of mass through the outer boundary and the total mass of the icm increases at the average rate of @xmath110 per gyr .    we conclude that the cluster - averaged abundances of helium and metals can significantly increase due to the combined effect of thermal diffusion and gravitational sedimentation at the outer boundary of the cluster , provided that these elements are present in sufficient amounts in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , outside this boundary . in the above calculations we assumed that their abundances are solar in the igm .",
    "this is true for helium , but metals are not expected to be present in significant amounts outside clusters of galaxies .",
    "therefore , eq.([eq : adot_fe ] ) may strongly overestimate the effect for iron .        in these calculations ,",
    "we did not account for bulk motion of gas at the outer boundary of the cluster .",
    "the full consideration of the effect of such motions is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , it can be easily shown that in the case of the gas outflow with the moderate velocity , @xmath111 km / s , the amplitude of the discussed effect will increase , whereas in the case of the gas inflow , the effect will be somewhat decreased .",
    "this is illustrated by the dash - dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : abund ] , showing the case of the gas bulk motion with velocity of @xmath112 km / s .",
    "note that at significantly higher velocities the total mass of gas out(in ) flow from the cluster becomes comparable to the total initial mass of the gas in the cluster , therefore full self - consistent consideration of the problem becomes essential .",
    "we finally note that the topology of the magnetic field and characteristics of turbulence may be different in the central parts of clusters of galaxies and in their outskirts .",
    "therefore , diffusion may be suppressed in the center of the cluster but operate at sufficient strength in its outer regions and vice versa .",
    "thermal diffusion can thus significantly affect the distribution of helium and heavy elements in galaxy clusters .",
    "this , together with the bias in the determination of heavy element abundances introduced by the standard assumption of solar helium abundance ( section  [ secxsz ] ) , can have important consequences for the interpretation of x - ray and sz observations of clusters .",
    "we now use results of previous sections to estimate the expected biases in the determination of cluster parameters .",
    "we divided the model cluster into concentric spherical shells and generated the x - ray spectrum of emission from each shell using the apec model in xspec and the electron number density , temperature and element abundances resulting from the diffusion calculations in section  [ secnum ] .",
    "we then fitted the generated spectra by apec assuming the solar abundance of helium .",

    "these results are presented for spherical shells , rather than for projected quantities , i.e. we implicitly assume that the x - ray data are of sufficient quality to enable the de - projection analysis .",
    "we see that the assumption of solar helium abundance results in a significant , up to @xmath113@xmath114 bias in the metal abundance determination . for the isothermal cluster it leads to a significant , more than a factor of @xmath89 , underestimate of the effect of the gravitational sedimentation for metals .",
    "the total mass of heavy elements in the icm is underestimated by 5.7% and 5.5% for a2029 and the isothermal cluster , respectively .",
    "the total mass of gas is underestimated by 7% and 8% , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature is only weakly sensitive to the helium abundance assumption and bias in its determination is thus small .",
    "the redistribution of elements in the icm also modifies the electron density profile ( due to the electroneutrlity condition ) and consequently the amplitude of the sz effect . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ figsz ] , we show the change in the radial profile of electron density after 7  gyr of diffusion for the isothermal cluster with @xmath115 kev and for a2029 . comparison with figs .",
    "[ figabund ] and [ figsz ] indicates that the change in the electron density is primarily caused by the diffusion of hydrogen . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figsz ] , we show the resulting changes in the comptonization parameter as a function of the projected radius .            we can finally estimate the bias in the determination of the angular distance , using equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) . to this end",
    ", we again assume that the observer has performed a de - projection analysis of the x - ray data and determined the temperature , metal abundance(s ) and emission measure for each spherical shell .",
    "we replace the integral in equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) by a sum over spherical shells .",
    "we find that the assumption of solar he abundance leads to an underestimate of the angular distance by @xmath116% and @xmath117 for the cool - core and isothermal cluster models respectively , at @xmath67 gyr and using the 1500 kpc aperture .",
    "the bias increases almost linearly with time and weakly depends on the aperture for apertures exceeding @xmath118 kpc in radius .",
    "its detailed dependence on time and aperture are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfit_t ] .",
    "as one can see from the right panel , in case of a2029 the angular distance bias decreases and even changes sign at small apertures .",
    "in particular , there is a value of aperture , about @xmath119 kpc in the particular case of a2029 , at which the bias equals to zero .",
    "this is a result of complex modification in the helium abundance profiles caused by combined action of gravitational separation and thermal diffusion .",
    "however , the position of the zero bias radius depends on the particular shape of the temperature profile .",
    "in addition cluster cores are usually difficult to observe because of the complications due to agn",
    ". therefore decrease of the bias at small apertures and existence of the zero bias aperture is most likely of no practical value for the angular distance measurements .",
    "we have considered the role of abundance anomalies in the intra - cluster medium in interpretating x - ray and microwave observations of clusters of galaxies in the cosmological context . in particular , we investigated the role of diffusion of elements in the icm . as is well - known @xcite , it is the density distribution of helium which can be affected by gravitational sedimentation of elements most strongly .",
    "however , since helium is fully ionized in the icm , its abundance ( to the contrary to metal abundances ) can not be directly measured from equivalent widths of emission lines .",
    "therefore , in practice , it is usually assumed that helium abundance in the icm equals to its primordial value .",
    "should this assumption be incorrect , significant biases in estimating the metal abundances , emission measure and total mass of the gas may arise ( section 2 ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the role of diffusion in the icm of clusters of galaxies is still debated .",
    "the two well - known factors that can potentially significantly reduce its importance are magnetic fields and the mixing effect of large - scale turbulence .",
    "we ignored this complexity and investigated the maximum possible effect of diffusion on the cosmological measurements with clusters of galaxies . to this end",
    ", we considered the full set of burger s equations for a multi - component plasma and solved them for two cluster models : ( i ) a cool - core cluster , which was represented by the temperature and mass profiles of a2029 , and ( ii ) an isothermal cluster with the same mass distribution and temperature of @xmath120 and 6 kev . in the case of the isothermal cluster , canonical gravitational sedimentation of elements occurs leading to a factor of @xmath3@xmath4 enhancement of helium and metal abundances in the cluster center on a @xmath121@xmath6 gyr time scale . in the case of the cool - core cluster model however",
    ", thermal diffusion counteracts the gravitational sedimentation , significantly reducing the abundances of all elements heavier than hydrogen in the cluster inner core , @xmath122@xmath123 kpc and producing an up to a factor of @xmath124@xmath0 enhancement of their abundances at the intermediate radii @xmath84@xmath125 kpc .",
    "there is a significant flux of helium and metals and outflow of hydrogen through the outer boundary of the cluster .",
    "this will lead to a noticeable increase in the cluster averaged abundances of the elements heavier than hydrogen at a rate of @xmath126 per gyr .",
    "of course , for the metals , this depends on their actual abundance in the igm .",
    "such a significant redistribution of elements will lead to a number of biases in the cluster parameters determined from x - ray data .",
    "the key role in these biases is played by an incorrect assumption about the helium abundance . in particular ,",
    "the metal abundances can be underestimated by up to @xmath8@xmath127 and the total gas mass can be underestimated by @xmath128 .",
    "when x - ray data are combined with microwave measurements to measure the angular distance to clusters of galaxies , the diffusion of elements can lead to an underestimate of the latter by @xmath76@xmath129 for apertures of the order @xmath130 , with the effect being stronger for isothermal clusters .",
    "furthermore , in the case of an isothermal cluster with temperature @xmath131 kev , the effect can reach @xmath113@xmath9 for small apertures of @xmath84@xmath85 kpc .",
