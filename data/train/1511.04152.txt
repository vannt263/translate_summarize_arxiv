    "integrable deformations of curves plays a crucial role in the differential geometry of space / plane curves @xcite . formulating the deformation of curves as the simultaneous system of the frenet - serret formula for the frenet frame of curves and its deformation equation",

    "this framework can be discretized so that it is consistent with the theory of discrete integrable systems , which is sometimes referred to as the discrete differential geometry @xcite .",

    "when we change the geometric structure of space / plane in the framework of klein geometry , the curve motions are governed by various integrable equations @xcite .",
    "therefore it may be an interesting and important problem to discretize such deformations of curves consistently with corresponding integrable structures .    in this paper , we consider deformation of the plane curves in the similarity geometry , which is a klein geometry associated with the linear conformal group . in this setting",
    ", it is known that the burgers hierarchy describes the deformations of similarity curvature of curves .",
    "we present discrete deformations of discrete plane curves in the similarity geometry described by the discrete burgers hierarchy as the isogonal deformations in which each angle of adjascent segments is preserved .",
    "the lattice intervals of the hierarchy are generalized to arbitrary functions of corresponding independent variables . using this formulation , we present explicit formulas of curves for both smooth and discrete cases .    in section [ sec : continuous ]",
    ", we give a brief summary of deformation of smooth plane curves in the similarity geometry , and we see that the burgers hierarchy naturally arises as the equations for the similarity curvature .",
    "we also construct the explicit formula for the family of plane curves corresponding to the shock wave solutions to the burgers equation . before going to the discrete curves",
    ", we formulate the discrete burgers hierarchy in section [ sec : discrete_burgers ] . in section [ sec : discrete_curve ] , we discretize the whole theory described in section [ sec : continuous ] so that the deformations are governed by the discrete burgers hierarchy .    in @xcite , the deformation theory of plane curves in the similarity geometry can be applied to the construction and generalization of aesthetic curves in cad .",
    "also , in @xcite discretizations for the class of nonlinear differential equations describing the motions of plane curves are constructed by using the geometric formulations , resulting in self - adaptive moving mesh discrete model of the original equation .",
    "this discretization enables to contruct highly accurate numerical scheme of given equation .",
    "the burgers equation is widely used as the universal model describing one - dimensional nonlinear dissipative system after various transformations which are difficult to discretize .",
