    "galaxy clusters are powerful laboratories wherein to test the structure formation theories and simulations of modern cosmology . for example , while enjoying many successes in explaining a large number of observational results @xcite , the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm appears to be inconsistent with details of the structure of cluster dark matter halos @xcite and galactic rotation and density profiles @xcite .",
    "the question of whether a cdm universe can produce the observed mass profiles of galaxy clusters without serious modification is currently unresolved , although the emerging consensus is that cdm alone probably fails to produce cluster cores like those observed ( e.g.@xcite ; see @xcite , however ) .",
    "the launch of the chandra x - ray observatory @xcite has made it possible to study the mass distribution in the central regions of galaxy clusters where the discrepancies between cdm models and observations are the most glaring @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 spatial resolution of the chandra / acis - s instrument , which corresponds to about 3 kpc at @xmath7 , is now comparable to that of ground - based optical measurements , ( although in practice low - n photon statistics limits the actual resolution achieved ) . for nearby clusters , for sufficiently long exposures",
    ", one can measure the mass profile of a cluster in the inner few kpc @xcite , scales which are generally inaccessible to gravitational lensing studies .",
    "the advantage possessed by gravitational lensing studies , however , is that the measurement is independent of the dynamical state of the gravitating matter . to derive a total gravitating mass profile from the baryonic x - ray emission map one assumes hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite , which in practice means that one assumes that the cluster is supported via isotropic thermal pressure ( i.e.@xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , and that no recent merger event has caused a disruption in the pressure , temperature and density profiles",
    ". one would expect clusters with fairly circular isophotes , and which contain cooling flows ( which are thought to be disrupted in merging events ",
    "see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) , to merit the simplifying hydrostatic treatment .",
    "emss 1358 + 6245 ( a.k.a .  , ) is such a galaxy cluster .",
    "discovered optically by zwicky @xcite and later in x - rays with the einstein ipc @xcite , it is a nearly circular , apparently relaxed cluster , with an abell richness class 4 @xcite and a central bright cooling flow @xcite . because of its moderate redshift ( @xmath0 ) , the entire cluster fits on the acis s3 chip , leaving enough blank field to derive a reliable background estimate .",
    "figure  [ f01 ] shows a broad band ( 0.3 - 7.0 kev ) acis s3 image of emss 1358 + 6245 , adaptively gaussian smoothed on scales of 1 to 10 pixels ( @xmath100.5 to 5 ) .",
    "the contour levels are listed from inner- to outermost ; contours associated with point sources in the field have been omitted .",
    "the presence of the cooling flow and the regularity of the x - ray isophotes suggest that hydrostatic equilibrium is a reasonable approximation of the dynamical state of the cluster gas .",
    "figure  [ f02 ] shows a mosaic of archived hst exposures of the central region of emms 1358 + 6245 with adaptively - smoothed soft - band ( 0.3 - 2.0 kev ) x - ray isophotes superimposed .",
    "note that the peak of the emission ( i.e.  the central green dot ) , at a value of 2.95 photons/(0.49)@xmath11 , appears to be slightly offset from the position of the central dominant galaxy ( cdg ) .",
    "we shall return to this point in  [ obs ] .",
    "the mass of emss 1358 + 6245 has been measured using both weak @xcite and strong @xcite gravitational lensing , and estimated from _ asca _  and _ rosat _",
    "observations @xcite .",
    "these measurements are roughly consistent , with a mass of about @xmath12 @xmath13enclosed within the 1 mpc . in this study",
    ", we use a chandra acis - s imaging spectroscopy to derive a mass profile of emss 1358 + 6245 and compare it to lensing measurements .",
    "we briefly outline the chandra observation and data analysis procedure in  [ obs ] .",
    "we describe our deprojection and modelling technique in ",
    "[ dep ] , and compare our results to previously published measurements in  [ comp ] .",
    "we then use our profile to constrain possible dark matter matter candidates in  [ dm ] .",
    "finally we summarize our findings in  [ sum ] .",
    "we assume @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 throughout ( 1  = 5.79 kpc at @xmath0 for @xmath17 ) .",
    "emss 1358 + 62 was observed with the chandra x - ray observatory for approximately 55 ks on 3 - 4",
    "september 2000 using the s3 chip on the acis detector .",
    "the level 2-processed data were aspect - corrected and filtered for periods of high background using the ciao software package , according to the standard procedures described in the @xcite .",
    "the center of the projected x - ray emissivity ( figure  [ f02 ] ) is offset from the optical position of the cdg by about 2  ( about 12 kpc ) .",
    "the offset , if real , has important consequences for the dynamical state of the cluster , so we carefully examined the the astrometry of the chandra field .",
    "we ran the ciao wavelet source detection routine _ wavdetect _",
    "@xcite on the acis s2/s3 fields ( i.e.  those chips closest to the acis - s aimpoint ) , and cross - correlated the output with the tycho-2 @xcite and usno - a2.0 @xcite catalogues .",
    "five usno sources and zero tycho sources were within 3  of a wavlet - detected chandra source .",
    "figure  [ f03 ] shows the location of the five usno sources in relation to the chandra acis s2/s3 field , the hst mosaic , and the cdg .",
    "although the tycho-2 catalogue is nominally more accurate than the usno - a2.0 catalogue , with internal astrometric standard errors in general less than 90 mas @xcite , above @xmath18 the usno positions are usually within 20 mas of the tycho-2 positions @xcite , making usno - a2.0 as effective an astrometric standard .",
    "of these five sources , two appear somewhat extended , either because they are galaxies or because they are sufficiently far from the acis aim point .",
    "the remaining three point sources were used as astrometric anchors to calculate the difference between the chandra and usno coordinates .",
    "these offsets are shown as filled circles in figure  [ f04 ] .",
    "the mean offset is represented by the small open circle , and its error by the ellipse .",
    "about half of the cdg / x - ray peak offset is due to the chandra field astrometry .",
    "figure  [ f05 ] shows the center of the cluster including this astrometric correction .",
    "the top panel shows broad - band ( 0.3 - 7.0 kev ) x - ray contours superimposed on the 0 - 10 pixel adaptively smoothed , @xmath19-binned broad - band chandra image .",
    "the same contours are also shown on the unsmoothed @xmath19-binned chandra image ( middle ) and on the central field of the hst mosaic ( bottom ) .",
    "the offset between the cdg and the x - ray peak that remains after the astrometric correction is 0.99 , while the error in the correction is 0.97 .",
    "therefore , the cdg and the x - ray emission peak are cospatial at about the 1-@xmath20 level .    after locating the center of the projected emissivity we divided the cluster into 10 concentric annuli such that each contained a minimum of 2000 counts ( 1600 - 2000 after background subtraction )",
    ", the center annulus being a disk . owing to decreased signal - to - noise in the outer bins , annuli 9 and 10 were constructed to contain roughly 4000 ( 2700 ) and 10,000 ( 3300 ) photons , respectively .",
    "we found that the extra counts in the last two annuli were required for numerical stability during the iterative fitting procedure , and they also helped to reduce the `` noise '' in the derived temperature profile .",
    "the annuli ranged ( outer radius ) from 11.5 to 285.8 pixels , which translates to 5.66 to 140.56 arcsec . at @xmath0 ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath21 to 800 kpc , for @xmath22 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and @xmath23 ( see table  [ t01 ] ) .",
    "all obvious point sources were removed , and a spectrum was extracted from each annulus .",
    "rmf and arf response matrices were constructed according to the @xcite , as was a background spectrum from an annulus exterior to the outermost bin .",
    "the spectra were recorded in pi format , and grouped such that there were a minimum of 20 counts per channel .",
    "we assume that the cluster is a spherical , self - gravitating pressure - supported plasma whose x - ray emission is optically thin .",
    "we assume hydrostatic equilibrium throughout ( except for small blobs of cold gas in the innermost regions which , although not hydrostatic , are assumed to be in a steady state ) .",
    "the hydrostatic equation can be written @xcite @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the local ( baryonic ) gas temperature and density , @xmath27 is the spherical radius , @xmath28 is the total mass enclosed within @xmath27 ( i.e.  baryons plus dark matter ) , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the proton mass and mean particle weight , respectively .    to check our assumption of spherical symmetry",
    "we examined the surface brightness map for deviations from circular symmetry .",
    "specifically , we performed a simple analysis to estimate the ellipticity @xmath31 ( and position angle @xmath32 ) of the cluster elongation .",
    "we calculate the luminosity of a pair of wedges a , centered on the x - ray peak of the cluster , and compare it to a second pair b perpendicular to the first ( see figure  [ f06 ] ) .",
    "the wedges have semiwidth @xmath33 , radius @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) , and phase @xmath32 ( or @xmath36 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the two wedge pairs is then    @xmath37 \\label{eq02}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath38 \\label{eq03}\\ ] ]    maximizing @xmath39 for @xmath40 yields the position angle , and then scaling @xmath41 until @xmath42 gives an estimate of the axial ratio , which is simply @xmath43 .",
    "the noise in the surface brightness map that tends to inflate @xmath44 for some @xmath32 is ameliorated somewhat by the smoothing introduced by the finite window size @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ f07 ] shows the axial ratio and position angle as a function of @xmath34 .",
    "the flattening is consistent with an ellipticity of 0.34 over an order of magnitude in @xmath34 , for @xmath45 . because much of this flattening is due to substructure in the soft emission due to the cool component ( which shows an axial ratio of 2.5 for @xmath46 ) , we feel confident that the assumption of spherical symmetry , especially in the hot , pressure - dominating component , is not unreasonable .",
    "we shall , however , return to the implications of @xmath47 in  [ dm ] .",
    "se also fit a 2-d @xmath48 model to the cluster emission map using the sherpa data analysis package @xcite .",
    "the profile is described by    @xmath49    where    @xmath50    @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the rotated coordinates :    @xmath53    and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the isophotal ellipticity and position angle , respectively .",
    "( we have assigned @xmath54 to the x - ray emission peak . ) here @xmath55 is the core radius and @xmath56 is the central surface brightness .",
    "we fit for the core radius , the amplitude , and the isophotal ellipticity and orientation .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood method of @xcite , as implemented in sherpa @xcite , rather than a @xmath57 minimization , because the vast majority of the image pixels contain fewer than @xmath58 photons .",
    "we find an ellipticity of @xmath59 for the cluster ( the position angle has an oblate / prolate degeneracy ) , although the uncertainty is underestimated due to parameter correlations .",
    "this indicates again that spherical symmetry is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the best fit parameter values are @xmath60 kpc and @xmath61 .    in order to derive _",
    "spherical _ radial profiles we construct a model consisting of @xmath62 concentric spherical shells whose inner and outer radii correspond to the inner and outer cylindrical radii of the projected annuli in the data set .",
    "( hereafter annuli / shells will be labeled 1 through n , in order of increasing radius . )",
    "quantities can be mapped between the two geometries through the upper diagonal matrix @xmath63 , whose elements @xmath64 contain the volume of spherical shell @xmath65 intersected by a cylindrical shell formed by the projection of annulus @xmath66 .",
    "if the volume emissivity of the gas in spherical shell @xmath65 is @xmath67 , then the luminosity of annulus @xmath66 , @xmath68 , is simply    @xmath69    where we have written the relation for all annuli simultaneously .",
    "since @xmath70 is related to the surface brightness @xmath71 through @xmath72 , the deprojection of the surface brightness is accomplished by inverting @xmath63 , which is completely specified by the binning geometry . because @xmath63 is upper diagonal , the solution set of volume emissivities is easily obtained working from the outer- to the innermost annulus .",
    "the emissivity of the outermost shell is simply @xmath73 , while the rest of the shells are calculated moving inward using    @xmath74    the volume emissivity of each spherical shell is characterized by a temperature and a normalization .",
    "the x - ray emission from each shell is modelled spectroscopically using mekal @xcite model in the xspec software package @xcite , which describes the emission from an optically thin thermal plasma .",
    "since a strong cooling flow signature was seen in both asca and rosat observations @xcite , we first sought to verify its existence in the chandra data .",
    "we modelled the inner two annuli separately using the cooling flow model cflow of @xcite in xspec , together with a mekal component and an intervening absorber .",
    "the cooling flow model is described by a mass deposition rate @xmath75 , a hot gas temperature and a low - temperature cut - off .",
    "we assume that the flow cools from the ambient cluster gas , so we pinned the hot gas temperature to the mekal temperature during the fitting procedure .",
    "we also assume that the emissivity is proportional to the inverse cooling time at the local temperature .",
    "an acceptable fit ( @xmath57/d.o.f .",
    "= 62.37/69 ) was obtained for a mass deposition rate of @xmath76 @xmath13  y@xmath5 ( 90% confidence interval ) and a low-@xmath25 cut - off @xmath77 kev .",
    "this result differs significantly from that of @xcite , who finds @xmath78 @xmath13/y .",
    "the discrepancy is due to the extra ( internal ) absorption component which that study assigns to the cooling flow emission .",
    "while we find no particularly compelling reason to incorporate an additional absorber in this type of model @xcite , we do not argue this point in the present study , since we merely wish to establish the presence of a cool emission component in the chandra data .    the bulk of the emission in the flow originates from the coolest gas , and so in the interest of simplicity we modelled the cooling flow component in the complete cluster analysis as a second mekal component , rather than with the cflow model . to determine the appropriate spatial extent of the cool gas we tried adding a second emission component ( at lower temperature ) to several of the inner spherical shells .",
    "( we shall refer to these two temperatures as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , for the hot cluster gas and the cooling flow gas , respectively . )",
    "we ran models with two components in ( a ) shell 1 , ( b ) shells 1 and 2 , ( c ) shells 1 through 3 , and ( d ) 1 through 4 .",
    "model b had a lower reduced chi - squared value than did model a , and the temperature and normalizations of cool components in models c and d were essentially unconstrained .",
    "we therefore adopted b as our working model , and note that this suggests that the cool gas extends out to about 70 kpc .",
    "it should also be noted that , unlike other deprojection methods , this method makes no assumptions about the shape of the temperature and density profiles other than spherical symmetry and the finite width of radial bins .",
    "the number of concentric shells that can used to construct this model is limited by two quantities , the memory allocation of the xspec program and the number of photons above the background in the spectrum .",
    "an active xspec model is limited to 1000 parameters , with only 100 allowed to vary at any time .",
    "each mekal component contains 6 parameters , but we allow only @xmath81 and the normalization to vary .",
    "in addition , we include an intervening column of galactic material which absorbs all emission components equally . for @xmath62 concentric annuli in the data ,",
    "there are @xmath82 emission components , where @xmath83 is the number of two - component shells . including the absorbing column yields a model with @xmath84 parameters .",
    "this model is applied to @xmath62 data sets , with the normalizations across them scaled by the appropriate geometric factors ( i.e.  ratios of @xmath63 terms ) .",
    "thus the complete xspec model contains @xmath85 $ ] components , with @xmath86 of them variable . in our case",
    "we had @xmath87 two - component shells , thus limiting @xmath62 to 11 .",
    "in practice , however , we found that we had to limit @xmath62 to 10 because the finite number of photons in our 55 ks spectrum caused instability during the numerical iteration if the temperature of any given shell was sufficiently unconstrained .",
    "it turns out that @xmath88 source photons per annulus are required to bring the `` noise '' in the fitted temperature profile to a level where numerical stability is achieved throughout the iterative process , which in our case resulted in 10 annuli ( using @xmath87 ) .",
    "thus our model contains a total of 730 parameters , with 25 of these floating , well under the xspec limit .",
    "the best - fit model has a chi - squared of 942.4 for 891 degrees of freedom ( there are 916 spectral bins in the data ) .",
    "the temperature and density profiles are shown in figure  [ f08 ] . the model shown at",
    "left allows the temperature of each shell to vary .",
    "note that the temperature profile is consistent with isothermality , with an error - weighted average temperature of @xmath89 kev , while the right side pins all the shells at 7 kev . in each case",
    "the second emission component is shown as the pair of points near @xmath90 0.1 and 0.2 arcsec .",
    "the inferred density profiles are nearly indistinguishable .",
    "the temperature and density profiles can be used to derive an entropy profile of the cluster .",
    "the discovery of an `` entropy floor '' in galaxy clusters @xcite and its subsequent measurement in many clusters @xcite have led groups to attempt to explain it in terms of an additional source of heat ( sne and/or agn activity ) which acts either to preheat the gas that collapses to form the cluster , or which heats the cluster throughout its formation @xcite .",
    "the specific entropy of the cluster baryons can be calculated using    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the electron number density of the gas . in figure  [ f09 ]",
    "we plot the entropy profile of the cluster .",
    "the cold gas entropy is shown for the inner two shells as well .",
    "the entropy of the hot cluster gas toward the center is consistent with the entropy floor of 70 - 140 kev @xmath4 reported by @xcite in their sample of 20 clusters .",
    "the temperature and density profiles can also be used according to equation  [ eq01 ] to measure the total gravitating mass in the cluster .",
    "figure  [ f10 ] shows the mass profiles corresponding to the temperature / density profiles of figure  [ f08 ] , with the logarithmic derivatives calculated as simple differences .",
    "the data points in the left panel represent @xmath28 , the mass contained within spherical radius @xmath27 , calculated using the density and unrestricted temperature profile shown in the left panels of figure  [ f08 ] .",
    "the solid blue curve represents the best - fit `` universal density profile '' of @xcite , hereafter the nfw profile , a two - parameter family of models whose functional form is    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is a scale length , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is a characteristic ( dimensionless ) density dependent upon the formation epoch of the dark matter halo .",
    "@xmath97 is the critical density at the observed redshift ; for a matter - dominated , @xmath98 , @xmath99 universe this is    @xmath100    the total mass scales as @xmath101 , so our baryon fraction is weakly dependent upon @xmath102 .",
    "of course , radial distances such as @xmath94 scale as @xmath101 .",
    "we report our best - fit values as @xmath94 and @xmath103 , the concentration parameter , defined by    @xmath104    in practice , because the form of our mass profile is @xmath28 and not @xmath105 , we use the integrated mass of the nfw profile as our fitting template , rather than the density :    @xmath106 \\label{eq13}\\ ] ]    where @xmath107 .",
    "using @xmath28 rather than @xmath105 spares us one numerical differentiation , which would augment the profile noise considerably .",
    "we find @xmath2 kpc and @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite have measured the central velocity dispersion of the galaxy located at the cluster center using the keck i 10 m telescope .",
    "using the low - resolution imaging spectrograph with a square 1.05aperture , they infer a central velocity dispersion of 311@xmath10811 km s@xmath5 . from hst",
    "photometry they obtain an effective radius of @xmath109  ( 23 kpc ) .",
    "asssuming a singular isothermal density profile with an istropic velocity dispersion , the enclosed mass is given by :    @xmath110    the dashed black line at left ( figure  [ f10 ] ) represents an isothermal sphere at @xmath111 km s@xmath5 , with the @xcite measurement shown as a filled circle plotted at the effective radius .",
    "although the point barely falls within the 1-@xmath20 envelope , it should be remembered that this point is a model extrapolation from the aperture radius .",
    "if one uses the aperture radius rather that the effective radius , the point lies very near the nfw best - fit line .",
    "we shall return to this point in  [ dm ] .",
    "the solid blue curve at the right half of figure  [ f10 ] shows the best - fit ( @xmath112 ) spherical nfw profile projected along the line of sight , i.e.  @xmath28 @xmath113 @xmath114 ( in order to compare with the surface density maps derived from weak lensing measurements ; see  [ comp ] ) . integrating equation  [ eq10 ] along the line of sight yields @xcite    @xmath115    where @xmath116 .    because of the `` noise '' in the solution , one point in the mass profile is unphysical",
    "this is caused by a 1-@xmath20 jog in the temperature profile at the seventh annulus .",
    "the ( positive ) logarithmic temperature gradient between annuli 6 and 7 swamps the density gradient ( see equation  [ eq01 ] ) causing @xmath117 ; this is represented in figure  [ f10 ] by an open dashed box at an arbitrary ordinate .    in order to ascertain whether this jog represents an unseen feature in the data or a fundamental flaw in the method , rather than an ordinary statistical fluctuation , we varied the initial conditions in the fitting procedure to see if the iterative process would converge to a solution lacking such a temperature anomaly .",
    "after many attempts we found that we could only move the jog to a different annulus . as a more rigorous check on the method , we analyzed a cluster simulated with marx that contained @xmath118 photons and no background ( j.  houck & m.  wise , private communication ) .",
    "we derived a mass profile for this cluster using 12 annuli , and found two unphysical points due to jogs in the otherwise smooth temperature profile .",
    "we therefore conclude that the single unphysical point in our mass profile for emss 1358 + 62 is _ not _ due to undetected peculiarities in the data , but is more likely a nonexceptional statistical fluctuation .",
    "we note here that in their deprojection analysis of hydra a , @xcite , who used a smooth parametric temperature profile , were still forced to effectively smooth across radial bins in order to reduce the `` noise '' in the mass profile , even though they had roughly 5 times the number of photons at their disposal .    nonetheless , we ran the model again , pinning @xmath79 at 7 kev , to see what effect this would have on the mass profile .",
    "the resulting temperature and density profiles are shown on the right side of figure  [ f08 ] . the effect on the mass profile , and its nfw fit , is small ; the scale length increases from @xmath119 to 197 kpc , and concentration decreases from 8.4 to 7.0 .",
    "the significance of these values will be discussed in  [ dm ] below .    the gas mass and total gravitating mass profiles",
    "are shown in figure  [ f11 ] , for the model wherein @xmath79 is allowed to vary .",
    "the @xmath120 kev model is very similar .",
    "the gas mass fraction rises from @xmath100.025 at 50 kpc to 0.18 at 0.6 mpc , scaling as @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the study of @xcite , who find baryon fractions of 0.100.22 for a sample of 13 clusters ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the mass of an isothermal sphere based on the @xcite measurement , and its corresponding profile , is also shown , as a filled circle and a dashed line , respectively .",
    "although these data do not allow us to distinguish between the gas , stars , and dark matter associated with the cdg , they clearly demonstrate that the total galaxy mass dominates the gas mass within the cluster center .",
    "our model does not allow us to determine the morphology of the cool gas within the inner two shells of cluster gas , although from our ellipticity estimation we suspect that it is fairly aspherical . however , its mass , density , and volume are completely specified , since we have assumed pressure equilibrium between the two temperature components . for the unconstrained temperature profile model , roughly 10% of the core volume",
    "is filled with cold gas , dropping to a tenth this value at the adjacent shell .",
    "table  [ t02 ] lists the relevant quantities for both gas components in the inner two shells .",
    "we note that the broadband ( 0.3 - 7.0 kev ) x - ray luminosity of the cool gas component in the inner shells is @xmath122 erg s@xmath5 , comparable to the luminosity of the `` x - ray overluminous '' ellipticals studied by @xcite .",
    "in order to assess the robustness of our derived mass profiles , we compare them to the the weak lensing profile of @xcite . while gravitational lensing measurements may suffer from biases introduced by distant , uncorrelated large - scale structure , the effect on the mass determination is expected to be small for distant , rich clusters ; for example , @xcite finds a typical 1@xmath20 uncertainty of about 6% for measurements out to 1.5 @xmath123 mpc .",
    "in addition , @xcite has shown that lensing and x - ray mass determinations are consistent provided one takes into account the presence of the lower temperature gas in the cooling flow .    because weak lensing mass profiles measure mass within a _ projected _ radius , we integrate the best - fit nfw profile ( equation  [ eq10 ] ) along the line of sight ( equation  [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "for both our treatments of the temperature profile of the baryons ( i.e.  variable vs.  frozen at 7 kev ) , the resulting mass profile agrees well with the weak lensing profile .",
    "the strong lensing measurement @xcite at 120 kpc exceeds the x - ray and weak lensing measurements by a factor of @xmath124 .",
    "we note that although the lensing results we quote and our x - ray measurement assume spherical symmetry , @xcite find evidence for an elliptical mass distribution with an axis ratio of @xmath125 .",
    "our analysis shows that while the x - ray surface brightness is very nearly circular at large radii , the axis ratio in the core could be as small as 0.7 .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry leads to an average overstimate of a factor of 1.6 in strong - lensing analyses of simulated clusters , which are generally not spherically symmetric @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we compute an `` effective velocity dispersion '' of our best - fit mass profile .",
    "using the nfw halo virial mass in the singular isothermal profile we obtain @xmath126 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this is substantially lower than the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xcite , @xmath127 km s@xmath5 . as noted by fisher et al .",
    ", the optical velocity dispersion is probably inflated by substructure along the line of sight to the cluster . as expected , our effective velocity dispersion agrees , within measurement errors , with the value of @xmath128 km s@xmath5 derived by @xcite by fitting an isothermal sphere to the weak lensing data .",
    "much has been made of the failure of cdm simulations to reproduce the observed structure of dark matter halos .",
    "a particular example of the problem is that cdm halos are steeper than observed dwarf galaxy halos . parameterizing the core profile as @xmath129 as @xmath130 , cdm simulations suggest either @xmath131 @xcite or @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "h@xmath133 observations low - surface brightness galaxies suggest a flatter profile , @xmath134 @xcite . instead of a triaxial , central cusp , as predicted by cdm simulations , @xcite find a spherical @xmath135 kpc core in the strong gravitational lens using a multiply - imaged background galaxy ( see @xcite and @xcite , however ) .",
    "a weak lensing study by @xcite also indicates soft cores and .",
    "the literature survey of @xcite suggests that the central density of clusters is about 0.02 @xmath13  pc@xmath136 , regardless of halo mass , whereas cdm predicts values of @xmath137 @xmath13  pc@xmath136 for dwarf galaxies , and larger still for more massive halos .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others use these discrepancies to argue for the existence of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) , which will tend to reduce both the core profile slope and central density of dark matter halos .",
    "x - ray measurements of cluster dark matter profiles , however , fall somewhat more in line with the cdm simulations .",
    "@xcite find a central slope of @xmath138 for abell 1060 .",
    "@xcite find that nfw provides a good description of the mass profiles they derive for a2199 and a496 from _ asca _  and _ rosat_observations , over the entire range for which they are able to derive a temperature profile . @xcite observed a2390 using the acis s3 detector on chandra and derive a mass profile which is consistent with the nfw profile , and find a concentration @xmath139 , as predicted by cdm .",
    "@xcite also find adequate agreement between their mass profile of a1835 , derived from a chandra acis - s3 observation , and the nfw profile , and consistency with weak lensing measurements .",
    "they calculate a scale radius of 640@xmath140 kpc and a concentration of 4.0@xmath141 .",
    "they find a slightly better fit when they model a1835 as a non - singular isothermal sphere , deriving a core size for the cluster ( distinct from the scale radius of an nfw fit ) of @xmath142 kpc .",
    "@xcite determine a central slope of @xmath143 for hydra a , and find no evidence for a flat , sidm dominated core , down to scales of @xmath144 kpc .",
    "however , their nfw fit to their mass profile results in a concentration @xmath145 , a factor of 3 larger than that predicted by cdm .",
    "in general we find that the nfw model provides an adequate fit to our mass profile . like the @xcite study , however , our fit to the mass profile of emss 1358 + 6245 results in a concentration which is somewhat higher than that predicted by nfw for rich clusters .",
    "the appendix of @xcite provides a prescription for calculating cluster parameters at the collapse ( i.e.  formation ) redshift @xmath146 , which is a function of cluster mass in this model . using the einstein - de sitter simulation with a cdm spectrum normalization @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( the scdm model of @xcite ) we calculate a collapse redshift of @xmath149 ; it is doubtful that a cluster this massive could have formed so early .",
    "nfw predicts a concentration of about 4 for massive clusters , but the scatter in their suite of simulations could be as high as 2 .",
    "one might ask at what level sidm can be ruled out by current observations .",
    "recently , @xcite simulated cluster - sized halos and found that relatively small dark matter cross - sections ( @xmath150 = 0.1 @xmath4 g@xmath5 ) produce relatively large ( 40 @xmath101 kpc ) cluster cores .",
    "@xcite simulated galaxy - sized halos and required interaction cross - sections as large as 5 @xmath4 g@xmath5 to reproduce the shallow central slopes of galaxy density profiles .",
    "as noted by @xcite and explored by @xcite , these findings can be reconciled if the dark matter interaction cross - section is velocity - dependent .",
    "for example , the two findings are roughly consistent with    @xmath151    with @xmath152 @xmath4 g@xmath5 , @xmath153 km s@xmath5 , and @xmath154 .",
    "@xcite , however , use supermassive black hole demographics to rule out sidm cross sections as large as this .",
    "they present a model with @xmath155 and @xmath156 @xmath4 g@xmath5 that is consistent with observed supermassive black hole masses .",
    "while their model does not remedy the galactic - scale dark matter halo problem , they sketch a scenario wherein the density cusps in such halos can be softened through black hole mergers .",
    "our mass profile for emss 1358 + 6245 shows no evidence for a flat core on scales larger than @xmath157 kpc . in figure  [ f12 ]",
    "we show power law fits to the mass profile as a function of the outermost point used in the fit .",
    "the profile is consistent with @xmath158 , or @xmath159 , somewhat steeper than cdm predictions .",
    "in fact , the inner profile displays behavior which is the _ opposite _ of what would be required for nearing a flat core ; @xmath133 should approach , not diverge from , 0 as @xmath130 .",
    "( the restriction is even more stringent since our model uses @xmath22 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 . )",
    "we place an upper limit on the core size by modeling the profile as a softened isothermal sphere :    @xmath160    we find a core size @xmath161 kpc ( 90% confidence ; @xmath162 ) .",
    "the contribution of the cdg to the mass profile for @xmath163 kpc is sufficiently small ( figure  [ f10 ] ) that we can directly compare our core size limit , @xmath164 kpc , with @xcite .",
    "the most conservative limit we can place must include the flattening that we determined in  [ dep ] . although the cluster as a whole exhibits an ellipticity of 0.34 , it could be higher toward the core ( see figure  [ f07 ] .",
    "the worst - case scenario would be that our innermost annulus just grazes the minor axis of a core ; in that case our limit should be scaled upward by a factor of @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , in keeping with a conservative posture , if we assume that the axial ratio in the core ( near @xmath165 kpc ; see figure  [ f07 ] ) is as high as 7/4 , then our core limit is 74 kpc , allowing us to conservatively rule out sidm with @xmath166 @xmath4 g@xmath5 .    in order to strengthen the case for the core size upper limit , we verified that our deprojection and modelling technique can indeed detect a core if one is present .",
    "we created a set of five simulated galaxy cluster observations to which we applied our deprojection and fitting method .",
    "each simulated cluster follows a @xmath48 model surface brightness profile , with @xmath167 .",
    "the @xmath48 model core radii @xmath55 ranged from 6 to 96 acis s-3 pixels ( 34.7 to 556 kpc ) , increasing by a factor of 2 for each successive cluster .",
    "otherwise the simulated clusters are similar to emss 1358 + 6245  @xmath0 , and the photons are sampled from a distribution at @xmath168 kev .",
    "in addition , each of the 10 annuli contains @xmath169 photons .",
    "once we have fit for the temperature and gas density of each shell , the mass profile computed using the hydrostatic equation , which is then fit using a non - singular isothermal sphere .",
    "the resulting fits , shown in figure  [ f13 ] , demonstrate that we can detect core structures in the mass profile .",
    "( the agreement between @xmath55 and @xmath170 might at first seem too good , particularly when one considers that @xmath55 is a projected beta model core radius , while @xmath170 is a spherical softened isothermal sphere core radius .",
    "however , we are pinning down the shape of the mass profile near the core radius , where the non - singular isothermal sphere is actually a good approximation to a beta model . at @xmath171 , for @xmath167 , the agreement is better than 5% . )    in figure  [ f14 ] we plot the sidm cross section constraints of several groups .",
    "the hatch marks delineate the region excluded by each constraint .",
    "the parameter space external to the triangular region is ruled out by @xcite by requiring that sidm ( 1 ) removes the halo cusp in dwarf galaxies , ( 2 ) does not cause core collapse in 20 km s@xmath5 halos , and ( 3 ) does not cause galactic - mass halos to evaporate in a hubble time .",
    "@xcite rule out other areas not shown here by considering the formation of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , specifically the lack of a bulge / smbh in m33 , and the presence of a bulge / smbh in the milky way .",
    "they arrive at sidm which is unable to remedy the cuspy halo problem of dwarf galaxies , and and we direct the interested reader to that study .",
    "we have indicated the results of computer simulations of @xcite and @xcite ( see arrows ) .",
    "our mass profile of emss 1358 + 6245 , in conjunction with the @xcite simulations , provide the constraint , ruling out the space indicated in blue .",
    "we observe that the core collapse and halo evaporation constraints of @xcite appear to rule out the model of @xcite in which sidm is responsible for dwarf galaxy halo cores .",
    "we note in passing that our observations are consistent with , though less restrictive than , the constraints derived by @xcite from smbh demographics .    while our central profile is consistent with nfw , it is intriguing that the average density within the inner 50 kpc of our mass profile is @xmath172 @xmath13  pc@xmath136 , consistent with the @xcite sample . if the @xcite measurement of the ( assumed isotropic ) velocity dispersion at 0.55  is extrapolated to @xmath173  ( 22 kpc ) as described in section ",
    "[ dep ] , the resulting density is , perhaps coincidentally , @xmath174",
    "@xmath13  pc@xmath136 , suggesting that the data allow the density profile to be flat from 20 to 50 kpc .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that this extrapolation assumes that it is appropriate to characterize the cdg density profile as a singular isothermal sphere over the range @xmath175 .",
    "( more conservatively , if the isothermal model is assumed to hold only at the aperture radius , the profile is consistent with the absence of a core . )",
    "however uncertain , this result is interesting because it is contrary to what would be expected from a dark halo associated with the central galaxy , and may offer a clue to the existence of sidm which flattens cluster cores on scales of 40 kpc .",
    "the issue can be addressed with a deeper chandra observation to enable one to probe the mass profile in x - rays down to the effective radius of the @xcite measurement , or through similar observations of other relaxed clusters .    on the other hand",
    ", we note that dark halos of cdgs would steepen the central density profile and possibly complicate detection of a very small , flat sidm core .",
    "ironically , the relaxed nature of rich clusters , which allows us to measure their masses by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , may turn out to obfuscate the details of the dark matter distribution .",
    "even so , chandra mass profiles appear to justify high - resolution n - body simulations with very low ( @xmath176 @xmath4 g@xmath177 ) dark matter interaction cross sections .",
    "we have used a new spectral deprojection technique to derive a dark matter profile from a chandra observation of emss 1358 + 6245 .",
    "our mass profile is consistent with optical weak lensing measurements @xcite .",
    "it is nominally consistent with an nfw profile , although our derived concentration larger than expected from cdm simulations by a factor of a few .",
    "our best - fit nfw profile is characterized by @xmath2 kpc and @xmath3 .",
    "we also model the cluster as a non - singular isothermal sphere and place an upper limit on the core size @xmath178 kpc ( 90% confidence ) . comparing this value to the simulations of @xcite",
