    "in a 1959 paper m.  e.  fisher introduced the general bond - decorated ising model as one example of a set of exactly solvable transformations of spin-1/2 ising models.@xcite a bond - decorated ising model has an `` arbitrary statistical mechanical system '' inserted in every original ising bond .",
    "the partition function of this decorated model is related to the partition function of the original or bare ising model by the addition of a prefactor and a renormalization of the coupling constants and magnetic moments ( the ising model is supposed to be in a parallel magnetic field).@xcite knowledge of the partition function of a given ising model thus allows one to obtain the partition function of any bond - decorated version of that ising model .",
    "more recently , streka and jaur have used the method of bond - decoration to investigate the thermodynamics of mixed ising - heisenberg chains in parallel magnetic fields where the decorating unit is a spin dimer or trimer with anisotropic heisenberg coupling ( see fig .  [",
    "4:fig : isingheisenberg]).@xcite the partition function of these chains is readily obtained from the known partition function of the ising chain and the energy levels of the decorating unit .",
    "therefore , they could calculate exact magnetic properties and theoretically show , for example , the existence of magnetization plateaus in certain bond - alternating chains .    the ising - heisenberg chain discussed in ref .",
    "( showing only two unit cells ) .",
    "the bonds of the ising chain ( 1-@xmath2-@xmath3-  )  are decorated with heisenberg dimers @xmath4(2 - 3 ) , ( @xmath5-@xmath6 ) , ",
    "the partition function of this chain is exactly solvable . ]",
    "the convenience of the decorated ising chain as a theoretical model for spin chains derives from the relative ease with which exact solutions are obtained , in contrast for example with the pure heisenberg chain , for which no exact partition function has been found . up to now",
    ", this property of solvability has been the prime motive for the study of these chains in the literature . indeed , in ref .",
    "the decorated ising chain was considered as a substitute for the intractable heisenberg model , and in ref .",
    "the principle reason for introducing ising bonds  to replace the more reasonable heisenberg bonds  in a chain of cu^2+^ ions was the desire to obtain a solvable model .",
    "this approach can be applied to any type of heisenberg chain with a repeating unit : replace enough  preferably ferromagnetic ",
    "heisenberg bonds by ising bonds to obtain a decorated ising chain that is solved easily and , in some cases , exhibits thermodynamic properties that are qualitatively comparable with those of the original chain.@xcite    however , the role of the decorated ising chain in the field of one - dimensional magnetism is not confined to that of a simplified model of realistic quantum spin chains . in this paper",
    "we show that some new molecular rings and chains are real examples of decorated ising systems .",
    "concretely , we treat a [ dycumocu ] infinite chain@xcite and a ( dycr)@xmath8 tetrameric ring.@xcite these compounds were recently synthesized in the course of the ongoing synthetic efforts to make new and better single - chain magnets ( scms ) and single - molecule magnets ( smms ) , whose characteristic property is a blocking or slow relaxation of magnetization at low temperatures .",
    "we will not be concerned here with these dynamical aspects of their magnetism , but only with their static magnetic properties .",
    "a necessary property of smms and scms is a magnetic anisotropy .",
    "one line of approach is to introduce anisotropy by means of lanthanide ions , whether or not in combination with transition metal ions.@xcite the two compounds considered here are products of this approach , with dysprosium as lanthanide ion",
    ".    the dy@xmath9 ion plays a crucial role in these systems ; the nature of the ground state of this ion in its ligand environment determines whether the system is a decorated ising system or not and consequently , whether its partition function is exactly solvable or not .",
    "the ground kramers doublet of dy@xmath9 must have complete uniaxial magnetic anisotropy - factor of the kramers doublet is not zero ; for example @xmath10 and @xmath11 . ] and must be separated from excited kramers doublets by an amount that is large compared with the exchange coupling ( typically , this separation must be 100  @xmath12 or more).@xcite the required information on the ground and excited doublets of the dy@xmath9 monomer can be derived from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on the monomer complex , isolated from the polynuclear compound.@xcite    the [ dycumocu ] chain and the ( dycr)@xmath8 ring are shown to be decorated ising chains in an arbitrarily directed magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic properties , in particular powder magnetization and susceptibility , are calculated with the help of the transfer - matrix method , which is a bit more general and convenient for numerical computation than the renormalization of the ising parameters , which was used by fisher and by streka and jaur .",
    "the results compare well with experiment and allow to determine values for the exchange coupling constants .    the excited crystal field kramers doublets ( or stark levels ) of dy@xmath9 are not included in the decorated ising model . because of their relatively low energetic position , these kramers doublets can have a non - negligible contribution to the magnetic properties of the chain .",
    "we account for this in a first approximation by adding this contribution , as calculated _ ab initio _ for the monomeric dy@xmath9 complex , to the results of the decorated ising model .",
    "part of the decorated ising chain . in each ising bond is inserted an arbitrary statistical mechanical system@xcite , called decorating unit , that interacts only with the two ising spins @xmath13 at the vertices of the bond .",
    "the ising spin variables commute with the hamiltonian and have definite values in the eigenstates of the chain.,width=325 ]    the decorated ising chain may be divided into units delimited by the ising spins , as in fig .",
    "[ 4:fig : decisingchain ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the decorated ising chain ( or ring ) of length @xmath14 may accordingly be written as follows : @xmath15 where the subhamiltonians @xmath16 correspond to units of the chain .",
    "if the chain is closed into a ring , periodic boundary conditions apply by identifying the last with the first spin : @xmath17 .",
    "the ising spins @xmath13 commute with the subhamiltonians and the subhamiltonians commute with each other : @xmath18=0 \\quad \\text{and } \\quad [ \\hat{h}_i,\\hat{h}_j]=0.\\ ] ] it is further assumed that there is no direct interaction between the decorating units themselves , i.e. , two different @xmath16 have no variables in common , except for an @xmath13 when they are neighbors . in writing eq .",
    "( [ 4:eq : hamdecising ] ) we made use of the fact that the ising spins are conserved variables and may be considered as parameters rather than operators . in the case of spin-1/2 , they take on the values @xmath19 and @xmath20 , so that to each decorating unit there correspond four different subhamiltonians @xmath21 .. in fact , any parameter that takes on a finite number of values can serve as @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ 4:eq : hamdecising ] ) . in practice however , @xmath13 represents most commonly a kramers doublet , which is most often described as an effective spin-1/2 .",
    "this is the case for the examples considered in this paper . ]    since there is no direct interaction between the decorating units of the chain , the subhamiltonians @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ 4:eq : hamdecising ] ) work  for a given set of @xmath13 values  on disjunct spaces .",
    "an eigenfunction of @xmath22 is then simply a direct product of @xmath14 independent eigenfunctions , one of each @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding energy is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath25-th energy level of @xmath21 .    following ref .",
    "we write the partition function of one decorating unit for fixed @xmath13 and @xmath26 on the bond vertices : @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 .",
    "the total partition function for the chain is then given by @xmath29 this is the well - known form of a transfer - matrix solution.@xcite each decorated bond ( or pair of neighboring ising spins ) is represented by a transfer matrix @xmath30 whose elements are the @xmath31 , the values of @xmath13 labeling the rows and the values of @xmath26 labeling the columns .",
    "explicitly for the spin-1/2 decorated ising chain : @xmath32 since most applications deal either with rings or very long chains , the boundaries can be identified ( @xmath17 ) and expression ( [ 4:eq : partitionfunction ] ) can be written as the trace of a matrix product : @xmath33 this is the most general expression for the partition function of a decorated ising chain .",
    "if the chain has translational symmetry the partition function is expressed in terms of eigenvalues.@xcite suppose that the chain is a repetition of identical decorated ising bonds , then the @xmath30 are all the same , so that @xmath34 where the @xmath35 are the eigenvalues of @xmath36 .",
    "according to perron s theorem on positive matrices , the eigenvalue @xmath37 with largest modulus is real , positive and nondegenerate.@xcite this yields the simple but exact result for the free energy per unit cell of the infinite chain : @xmath38 if a unit cell of the chain is spanned by @xmath39 decorated bonds instead of one then it is only necessary to combine @xmath39 transfer matrices into one new transfer matrix @xmath40 , with largest eigenvalue @xmath41 , to be used in eqs .",
    "( [ 4:eq : partfunc_periodic ] ) and ( [ 4:eq : freenergy_infinite ] ) , where @xmath14 is to be replaced by @xmath42 .",
    "this situation arises , for example , when the local easy axes on the ising ions are not parallel but canted with respect to each other .",
    "the solution in terms of transfer matrices , eq .",
    "( [ 4:eq : partfunc_transmatr ] ) , is not limited to decorated spin-1/2 ising chains .",
    "it is valid for chains having ising spins of any multiplicity or a combination of ising spins with different multiplicities , in which case the dimension of the transfer matrix is different from two by two .",
    "another advantage of the transfer matrix method is that it can be readily extended to include next - nearest - neighbor bonds between the ising spins . to this end",
    ", the transfer matrix has to be enlarged so that it does not jump from one ising spin to the next , but from one _ pair _ of ising spins to the next pair.@xcite      we are interested in this paper in molecular chains or rings that can be described by a decorated ising model .",
    "this means that their low - energy spectrum can be modeled to satisfactory accuracy by an effective hamiltonian that has the properties described in section [ 4:sec : decising ] .",
    "it has been noted there that the composition of the decorating unit is basically arbitrary and we need therefore not consider the properties of that part .",
    "instead , our attention goes here to the molecular realization of the ising spin [ @xmath13 in eq .  ] .",
    "we focus on because this ion is used in the two examples studied below , but the discussion applies equally well to several other trivalent lanthanides and also to some transition metal ions .",
    "it is known that lanthanide ions in a coordination environment are often well described by crystal field theory applied to the ground @xmath43 level .",
    "one assumes that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 remain good quantum numbers .",
    "is a kramers ion that belongs to the second half of the lanthanide series , whose ground level is ( @xmath47 ) , with associated land factor @xmath48 .",
    "this multiplet splits into eight kramers doublets by the crystal field perturbation ( except for high - symmetric environments belonging to the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , or @xmath51 point groups , which split the multiplet in less than eight levels ) .",
    "it will be useful to view each kramers doublet as an effective spin-1/2 with its own @xmath1-factors ( 3 in number ) and corresponding magnetic axes .",
    "for example , take the kramers doublet @xmath52 ( of the level ) , quantized with respect to the @xmath53 axis .",
    "its @xmath1 factors are @xmath54 and @xmath10 .",
    "if the action of the crystal field on is such that the lowest kramers doublet is separated from the next one by an energy that is large compared to the energy of interaction with the magnetic field and the exchange interaction with neighboring ions , we can omit all excited kramers doublets from the hamiltonian and keep only the lowest doublet . in this way",
    "is described by a spin of 1/2 and every interaction in which it takes part enters the hamiltonian as a linear combination of the three spin operators @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . if we now want to be an ising spin , defined by the first commutation relation in eq .",
    ", it is clear that only one of these spin components , say @xmath57 or simply @xmath58 , may actually appear in the hamiltonian . in other words",
    ", there must be no interaction that creates an off - diagonal matrix element between the two components of the kramers doublet .",
    "this can be shown to be true with high accuracy if the lowest kramers doublet is @xmath52 .",
    "the two interactions of importance here are the zeeman interaction with the magnetic field and the exchange interaction with other magnetic ions .",
    "the zeeman hamiltonian follows directly from the @xmath1 factors of the kramers doublet ( vide supra ) , and is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath53 component of the applied magnetic field .",
    "note that the field may be applied in any direction , but it is only the @xmath53 component that interacts with the kramers doublet because @xmath10 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath61 and @xmath62 in @xmath52 follows from the selection rule stating that a vector operator ( the magnetic moment in this case ) can not connect states for which @xmath63 differs by more than one unit",
    ". we will sometimes refer to the @xmath53 axis as the anisotropy axis , to stress that it is the only magnetic axis with nonvanishing @xmath1 factor .    to evaluate the effect of exchange interaction ,",
    "we must first take a closer look at the composition of the kramers doublet . in terms of the russel - saunders states @xmath64 we have @xmath65 in a basic ( super)exchange process between two magnetic centers ,",
    "one electron of each center takes part .",
    "if we look at one center , the process removes an electron with certain spin projection ( up or down ) and puts it back on the center either with the same or with opposite spin projection.@xcite this gives rise to the selection rule @xmath66 . if the exchange interaction is to connect both components of the kramers doublet in eq .",
    ", at least five successive processes are needed , for @xmath67 . in other words , not one but five electron spins",
    "have to be flipped to connect @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "if the basic exchange process ( i.e.  the one for which @xmath70 ) occurs in , say , @xmath71th order of perturbation theory then an off - diagonal matrix element between the two components can only appear in @xmath72th order of perturbation theory .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the off - diagonal matrix element is negligibly small compared to the diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath73 ) so that the effect of exchange interaction on the kramers doublet is accurately described by the @xmath57 spin operator only .",
    "note that we derived the selection rule for exchange interaction on the basis of the spin quantum number @xmath74 only , without paying attention to the angular momentum quantum number @xmath75 , although @xmath75 changes even more than @xmath74 between the states of the kramers doublet .",
    "the existence and precise form of a selection rule for @xmath75 depends on the spatial symmetry of the exchange problem under consideration .",
    "@xmath76 is therefore not as useful as @xmath77 for predicting the vanishing of certain matrix elements of exchange interaction .",
    "note however that , even in the lowest symmetry , there is a maximum to the amount that @xmath75 can change in the basic exchange process described in the previous paragraph : within the @xmath78 orbitals , a one - electron process can bring about at most a change of @xmath79 .",
    "so we would have , in general , that a basic exchange process can induce the following changes in a lanthanide state : @xmath80 thus at least two steps of this kind are needed to bridge @xmath81 , but at least five are needed to bridge @xmath67 .",
    "so in this case , the selection rule of @xmath74 gives the stronger result and leads to the conclusions ",
    "reached in the last paragraph  on the matrix elements of exchange interaction in the kramers doublet .",
    "we can now derive the precise form of that part of the effective hamiltonian that refers to the exchange interaction between a ion [ with ground state ] and another magnetic center .",
    "we consider two cases , which we shall encounter in the examples in sections [ 4:sec : chain ] and [ 4:sec : ring ] : in the first case the other center is another ion ; in the second case the other center is an ion with an isotropic spin moment @xmath82 .",
    "consider first the exchange interaction with another ion .",
    "we assume that the second has the same property of uniaxiality as the first one and that it also shares all other relevant properties discussed in the previous paragraphs .",
    "then both ions are represented by a spin-1/2 doublet with a local anisotropy axis @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and we already know that the effect of exchange interaction in each doublet is proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the exchange hamiltonian is necessarily of the form @xmath86 where it is understood that the first spin belongs to ion 1 and the second to ion 2 .",
    "note that @xmath87 and @xmath88 need not be parallel with each other .    as a second case ,",
    "consider the interaction between ( anisotropy axis @xmath87 ) and an isotropic spin @xmath89 .",
    "the latter may typically be a transition metal ion with quenched orbital momentum .",
    "we found that the exchange processes that contribute do not change the spin projection on the ion ( @xmath90 , quantization axis @xmath87 ) , and that this result is independent of the exchange partner .",
    "it is also known that every exchange process commutes with the total spin ( the matrix elements involved are spin - independent matrix elements of kinetic , potential , and coulomb energy @xcite ) , so that @xmath91 .",
    "it follows then that @xmath92 , or , the exchange hamiltonian commutes with the @xmath93 component of @xmath89 .",
    "the simplest expression compatible with this requirement is @xmath94 where @xmath58 naturally represents and @xmath46 represents @xmath89 .",
    "the interaction is of ising form with the anisotropy axis of as ising axis .",
    "note that , when @xmath95 , higher powers of @xmath96 may enter the hamiltonian .",
    "considering exchange interaction as a perturbation however , one can usually assume that the lowest - order contribution , eq .  , is the leading term .",
    "there are other cases conceivable , for example dipole - dipole interaction between the moment of and a neighboring moment .",
    "one will always find , as above , that the hamiltonian is a product of @xmath57 ( belonging to ) and a part that belongs to the other ion and whose form depends on the kind of the other ion and on the details of the interaction .",
    "we have now obtained that a ion , if its ground state is @xmath52 , fairly well separated from excited states , interacts with the magnetic field and with neighboring ions as an ising spin-1/2 , in the sense that the interaction is always proportional to @xmath57 , as expressed in the eqs .  , , and .",
    "this means that a chain - like molecular structure having ions of this kind at regular positions in the chain would meet the requirements of a decorated ising chain , given in part by eqs .   and .",
    "it remains of course to be shown that @xmath52 can indeed be the ground state of a coordinated ion in a polynuclear complex .    at first sight",
    ", this seems rather unlikely .",
    "@xmath52 is an eigenstate of cylindrical symmetry . within lanthanide",
    "@xmath97 states , the crystal field is effectively cylindrical if there is , at least , an eightfold rotation axis ( @xmath98 ) or rotation - inversion axis ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "@xcite @xmath99 symmetry has been obtained , for example , in mononuclear bis(phtalocyaninato ) sandwich complexes of the lanthanides . @xcite",
    "even when such high symmetry is attained , the ground state is not necessarily the cylindrical doublet with highest @xmath100 value .",
    "@xcite apart from that , the symmetry of the coordination sphere of a lanthanide ion in a polynuclear , possibly heterometallic , complex or chain is usually much lower or even completely absent .",
    "such is the case for the two examples considered in this paper . on the basis of symmetry alone",
    ", there is thus no reason to expect @xmath52 to be an eigenstate , let alone the ground state .",
    "nevertheless , recent _ ab initio _ calculations have revealed the unexpected result that the ground state of several low - symmetry complexes of is very close to @xmath52 . @xcite they used the multiconfigurational , wavefunction - based casscf / rassi - so method , to obtain accurate wavefunctions for several of the lowest kramers doublets .",
    "calculation of the principal @xmath1 factors of these states gives an indication of their composition .",
    "it was found in several cases that the ground doublet has @xmath101 close to , but lower than 20 , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 close to 0 .",
    "this corresponds to a doublet mainly composed of @xmath52 .    with evidence of _",
    "ab initio _ calculations it is thus possible to identify in certain coordination environments as an ising spin-1/2 ( to a good approximation ) .",
    "we will use this information to identify the compounds in sections [ 4:sec : chain ] and [ 4:sec : ring ] as decorated ising chains ( or rings ) .    to conclude this section",
    "we remark that one can not deduce from the vanishing of two @xmath1 factors alone that a kramers doublet will behave as an ising spin .",
    "it will , of course , in its interaction with the magnetic field [ eq .  ] , but this will not , in general , be true for the exchange interaction .",
    "take again the example of , supposing the ground state is the kramers doublet @xmath102 .",
    "it is perfectly uniaxial because @xmath10 and @xmath103",
    ". a closer look at the expansion of @xmath102 in terms of the russel - saunders states @xmath104 shows , however , that the selection rules in eq .",
    "permit a matrix element to exist between @xmath105 and @xmath106 , therefore introducing non - ising terms ( i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) in the same order of perturbation theory as the ising term in the exchange hamiltonian .",
    "there exists a similarity between the spectra of the decorated and undecorated ising chains at which we want to take a closer look here .",
    "we suppose infinite , periodic chains , or periodic , even - membered rings ( in odd - membered rings spin - frustration complicates the picture ) .",
    "we also limit ourselves to chains with ising spins of 1/2 .",
    "the undecorated , or simple , ising chain in a magnetic field @xmath107 parallel with the @xmath53 axis is given by eq .   and @xmath108 where @xmath13 is the @xmath53 component of @xmath109 ( @xmath110 )",
    ". we assume , without loss of generality , @xmath111 . the eigenstates of the chain are spin _ configurations _ like ( @xmath112  ) , etc . of the @xmath113",
    "eigenstates only two distinct ones can be the ground state : the ferromagnetic ( f ) and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) : @xmath114 when @xmath115 time - reversal symmetry makes every state degenerate with the state formed by flipping all the spins .",
    "this degeneracy is meant to be implied in , where only one of two states is shown in each case .",
    "only the two af states remain degenerate when @xmath116 .",
    "when @xmath117 a ground state level crossing occurs from af to f when @xmath107 is increased . at the point of crossing ( @xmath118 )",
    "the two af states are degenerate together with all states derived from an af state by flipping one or more down - spins up .",
    "however , no other state than af or f can be the ground state at any other value of @xmath107 .",
    "thus the ground state of the ising chain is either f or af , and they are degenerate , together with an infinite number of other states , at the crossing point .",
    "we now decorate the ising bonds with identical but arbitrary units to obtain a periodic decorated ising chain .",
    "the spectrum is given by eq .  .",
    "since the chain is periodic , the spectrum of the individual units @xmath16 is independent of @xmath119 and the energies may be written as @xmath120 , with @xmath71 ranging over the eigenstates of @xmath16 .",
    "there are four sets of @xmath120 : @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , in an obvious notation .",
    "notice that the eigenstates of this chain can still be classified according to the configuration of the _ ising _ spins : ( @xmath112  ) etc . , which follows from the fact that all the @xmath13 and @xmath22 form a commuting set of observables .",
    "an interesting question is whether the same rules hold for the ground state of the decorated ising chain as did for the simple ising chain .",
    "the answer is yes ; the ground state is either f or af ( referring to the ising spin configuration ) and a crossing between them is possible , with the same number and kind of degenerate states as in the simple ising chain . to show this , we have to consider only the lowest eigenstate belonging to each of the @xmath113 possible ising spin configurations . in these states",
    "every unit is in its lowest possible state for the given orientation of the neighboring ising spins : @xmath125 ( we assume this energy to be nondegenerate ) , so that the total energy of the chain state is @xmath126 where @xmath127 denotes the number of pairs of neighboring ising spins that are both spin up , etc . for example , in the f configuration in eq .  , @xmath128 ( periodic boundary conditions are assumed ) , while in the af configuration , @xmath129 .",
    "the eigenstates we have just described , with energy , are in an obvious one - to - one correspondence with the eigenstates of the simple ising chain .",
    "the ground state is found by minimizing with respect to the @xmath130 , under the restrictions @xmath131 the first relation states that the total number of ising spins ( or , equivalently , unit cells ) is @xmath14 .",
    "the second relation follows from the fact that , in a cyclic spin configuration , every @xmath132 pair must eventually be followed by a @xmath133 pair , possibly after a number of @xmath134 pairs .",
    "another restriction is that whenever both @xmath127 and @xmath135 are not zero , @xmath136 [ and by eq .   also @xmath137 must be at least one . using",
    "we can rewrite eq .   as @xmath138\\bigr)\\\\ & + n_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}\\bigl(\\varepsilon_1(\\downarrow\\downarrow)- \\frac{1}{2}[\\varepsilon_1(\\uparrow\\downarrow )",
    "+ \\varepsilon_1(\\downarrow\\uparrow)]\\bigr)\\\\ & + \\frac{n}{2 } [ \\varepsilon_1(\\uparrow\\downarrow)+\\varepsilon_1(\\downarrow\\uparrow ) ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we see that only the average @xmath139/2 $ ] of the `` antiparallel '' energies enters the equation .",
    "the last term is a constant and can be discarded for the purpose of relative energy considerations .",
    "we can now derive the values of @xmath127 and @xmath135 for the ground state of the chain , keeping in mind that @xmath125 is a function of the magnetic field @xmath140 .",
    "suppose then , first , that @xmath141 .",
    "time reversal symmetry asserts that @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "it is simple to see that , depending on the relative ordering of @xmath144 and @xmath145 , @xmath146 is minimal in the f configuration ( @xmath128 or @xmath147 ; @xmath148 ) when @xmath149 or in the af configuration ( @xmath150 ; @xmath151 ) when @xmath152 ( we exclude the possibility of equality of both energies from the discussion ; @xmath153 would correspond , in the simple ising chain , with @xmath154 ) . when @xmath155 , time reversal symmetry is not operative , and we have , in general , four different energies @xmath125 .",
    "the equation shows that the configuration that minimizes @xmath146 is determined by the sign of the two terms in round brackets ; if both are positive , then @xmath150 ( af configuration ) ; if at least one of them is negative , then either @xmath128 or @xmath147 ( f configuration ) , depending on whether respectively @xmath144 or @xmath156 is lower .",
    "finally , the magnetic field can induce a transition from the af to an f ground state configuration , say with all ising spins up .",
    "this happens when @xmath157,\\ ] ] and @xmath158 . at this point ,",
    "the ground state configurations are all those for which @xmath159 , exactly the same as in the simple ising chain .    we find thus a complete analogy between the simple and the decorated ising chain as far as the ground state ising spin configuration is concerned .",
    "the only possible configurations are the fully antiferromagnetically aligned and the fully ferromagnetically aligned configurations .",
    "no `` intermediate '' configuration can be the ground state .",
    "the only exception is the crossing point between af and f , where there is a high degeneracy of configurations .",
    "these conclusions are independent of the nature of the decorating unit .",

    "the most important of these is the requirement of a ground state kramers doublet with completely uniaxial magnetic anisotropy ( this statement is simplified , see section [ 4:sec : dy ] for the correct details ) .",
