    "significant progress in quantum physics in the last decade has essentially influenced the evaluation of the role and qualitative content of quantum physics , though , certainly , its fundamentals have been pre - served . in the earlier studies of specific nonclassical features of quantum systems , an experimenter only had to ensure suitable macroscopic conditions ( via choosing an object , using macroscopic fields , providing for necessary temperature , etc . ) .",
    "but today , it has become possible to intentionally vary directly quantum states of elementary quantum systems .",
    "this possibility initiated a number of novel applied sciences and technologies , such as quantum cryptography , quantum communications , and quantum calculation physics [ 14 ] , which exploit nonclassical features of quantum system states .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of quantum specific features characterizing physical systems ( these features are involved in the above applications ) can be found in the latest reviews [ 510 ] and monographs [ 1114 ] . despite the variety of physical mechanisms used for generation , processing , and transmission of quantum information ,",
    "all of them are principally based on the only essential difference between quantum and classical events .",
    "this is non - commutativity of quantum variables of systems under consideration , which is equivalent to the nonorthogonality of their quantum states .",
    "because of this circumstance , it is impossible to consider an arbitrary set of quantum events within the framework of classical logic , which is the result of the so - called incompatibility of nonorthogonal states .    indeed , suppose two quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are orthogonal .",
    "then , using them as an algebraic basis for an algebra with addition in the form of linear subspace union ( sp ) and product in the form of intersection , we find that the algebra of quantum events constructed on @xmath0 and @xmath1 contains only four subspaces @xmath2 , including the empty @xmath3 and 2d hilbert @xmath4 spaces .",
    "it is equivalent to the algebra of four elements @xmath5 , @xmath6 constructed as an aggregate of subsets contained in the set of two point elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the indices of quantum states under consideration ) with addition of subsets in the form of their sum and product in the form of their intersection .",
    "this algebra , considered as an elementary example , corresponds to the classical ( bivalent , i.e. , aristotelian [ 15 ] ) logic underlying classical physics , where the rule of the excluded third holds : either @xmath9 or not-@xmath10 . in the above example",
    ", this rule is expressed as @xmath11 in terms of indices and as @xmath12 in terms of states . here , @xmath1 has the sense of negation of event @xmath0 and @xmath13 has the sense of a known certain event . note that both elementary events @xmath0 and @xmath1 belong to this class of events .",
    "if two states are nonorthogonal , in the relationship @xmath14 state @xmath1 is not negation of @xmath0 because it includes a nonzero projection on @xmath0 along with the infinite set of other states @xmath15 existing due to the superposition principle . in this case , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are , respectively , eigenvectors of two non - commuting operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 of certain physical quantities .",
    "these quantities can not be measured simultaneously since their quantum eigenstates are nonorthogonal .",
    "when the above physical quantities take their possible values , the corresponding sets of quantum states are incompatible because they can not be considered simultaneously within the framework of classical logic .",
    "below , we present an elementary analysis which reveals a close relationship between physical quantities and their corresponding quantum states .",
    "determination of the relationships directly between coupling states and the quantitative measurement of information carried by these states is the subject of the information theory .",
    "the purpose of this study is to analyze the choice of an adequate quantitative measure of quantum information and its possible role in physics . to this end",
    ", we investigate a number of basic physical models of quantum systems and schemes of physical experiments in the presence or absence of incompatibility of quantum states , which is their only fundamental specific feature causing various quantum effects . in section",
    "i , the main types of quantum information and corresponding quantum measures are classified using this criterion . in sections",
    "ii and iii , we successively consider coherent and compatible information .",
    "the latter type of quantum information is closely related to quantifying information efficiency of a given experimental scheme .",
    "this problem is discussed in section iv .",
    "the notion of quantum information formulated simultaneously with the basic laws of quantum physics is directly related to them and plays a key role in their interpretation . any quantum effect ( for example",
    ", the essentially microscopic process of the atom spontaneous radiation or a macroscopic transition to the super - conducting state ) can explicitly be related with the processes of quantum information transformation if this information is adequately associated with the corresponding ensembles of quantum states .",
    "one can also state that a prototype of quantum information had appeared before the classical shannon information theory was developed .",
    "it suffices to recall the born interpretation of the physical sense of the wave function or to analyze the information content of the quantum measurement postulate ( the wave function collapse ) [ 16 ] .",
    "the notion of quantum information was admitted to be important long ago .",
    "however , interest in its application has only recently been stimulated by the development of modern quantum optics experimental methods ensuring quantum system control .",
    "progress in this area of quantum physics enables one to employ quantum information not only as a useful abstract notion but , also , to manipulate it in actual experiments in a free manner .",
    "studies of quantum information processing initiated quantum information physics .",
    "this new field of physics is covered in the literature referred to in the bibliography index [ 17 ] .    proceeding from the conventional description of quantum mechanics [ 16 , 18 - 20 ] , one can suppose that proper physics must deal only with quantum - physical quantities , whereas quantum states could rather be studied , irrespective of specific physical variables , within the framework of mathematics , one of whose fields is sometimes qualified as the classical information theory .",
    "however , a more comprehensive analysis shows that this is not true : as soon as quantum states are associated with eigenstates of physical variables characterizing an actual quantum model , they become carriers of physically meaningful information .",
    "for example , let us consider the mathematical structure of self - adjoint operators @xmath16 in hilbert space @xmath13 , which are used in quantum - mechanical representations of physical variables .",
    "then , the spectral decomposition of operator @xmath18 describes its splitting into mathematical objects of two types : the set of physically possible values @xmath19 and the set of corresponding quantum states @xmath20 .",
    "the latter objects contain the most general physical information which is independent of specific values @xmath19 and characterizes only certain physical events .",
    "each of these events lies in the fact that a physical quantity takes one of the values @xmath19 .",
    "information relationships between quantum states are determined by the dynamic properties of a physical system and , evidently , provide for the most fundamental description of its dynamic characteristics .",
    "these relationships may characterize the intrinsic dynamics of a quantum system and its interaction with other systems .",
    "initially , they are represented as equations for wave functions or quantum state operators .",
    "the theoretical information approach is based on introducing an adequate quantitative measure of information exchange . in the general case ,",
    "being independent of specific physical variables , this measure is superior to them in the analysis of general dynamic properties of a quantum system .",
    "if a specific scheme of a physical experiment is not discussed , a quantum system is described using its information characteristics which yield quantitative relationships between the quantum states of a given system and the quantum states of other systems that may interact with it .",
    "for example , the main information content of a two - level atom radiation is reduced to the fact that the quantum information carried by this atom is transferred to the corresponding quantum of the photon field . in this situation ,",
    "the quantum receives information on the phase of the initial atom state , i.e. , the information exchange is essentially quantum and retains coherence of the transformed wave functions ( see section ii ) . thus , the information description is more comprehensive than in the case when it is represented in terms of the atom - field energy exchange .",
    "the fundamental concept of classical information measure is formulated in the shannon information theory [ 21 , 22 ] . for classical systems of physical events , a unified quantitative measure of information can be introduced , which is independent of neither the specific physical content of this information nor its usage .",
    "this measure enables one to express the asymptotic level of error - free transmitted information content as the optimized shannon information content , which is necessary for combining numerous channels in the presence of noise .",
    "this elegant theory is based on a special property of classical ensembles that is excluded from the original principles of quantum physics .",
    "this property is reproducibility of classical events : statistically , it makes no difference whether one and the same physical system or its information - equivalent copy is at the input and output .",
    "however , the latter situation is impossible in the quantum world .",
    "obviously , this circumstance initiated the discussion of the question whether the shannon information measure could be applied to quantum systems [ 2325 ] .    in this paper",
    ", it is shown that the traditional definition of the shannon entropy and the corresponding information measure can successfully be used for analyzing quantum systems also in the case when fundamental differences between ensembles of classical and quantum events are properly taken into account .",
    "the quantum theory involves the principle of quantum state superposition implying the existence of an arbitrary linear combination @xmath21 of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which results in the presence of a continuum set in any quantum system .",
    "this set is hilbert space @xmath22 of states , most of which do not coincide with any orthogonal basis states @xmath20 associated with a certain physical quantity described by the operator @xmath23 .",
    "when a quantum system is transformed , the basis vectors and the entire hilbert space are also transformed .",
    "this circumstance , which is exploited in algorithms of quantum calculations , significantly enhances their efficiency due to high concurrency of operations [ 3 , 4 , 13 ] .",
    "however , the above continuum set does not contain an unlimited information content in the conventional classical sense .",
    "the point is that an arbitrary quantum state @xmath24 can be distinguished from another state @xmath1 only when the states are orthogonal .",
    "the probability of random coincidence of two arbitrary states is determined by the squared absolute value of the scalar product , so that the 2d probability density of two equiprobable states has the form @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are small volume elements on the sphere of wave functions satisfying the normalization @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the dimension of space @xmath13 . within the framework of the shannon information theory , one can find effective number @xmath30 of states @xmath7 distinguishable by variable @xmath8 and vice versa [ 26 ] .",
    "probability distribution describes the information exchange between two information variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which , according to the shannon theory , is characterized by effective number @xmath30 of error - free transmitted messages that are formed of subsets @xmath31 of indices corresponding to quantum states @xmath7 .",
    "this effective number ( calculated per symbol ) is attained for infinitely long sequences of independently transmitted unit symbols .",
    "when each @xmath31 is associated with appropriate states @xmath7 , all of these states will be distinguished without error ( in the above sense ) , so that @xmath30 is the number of distinguishable states .",
    "it is determined by the corresponding shannon information content @xmath32    using the formula @xmath33 . for joint probability distribution ( 1 ) ( see [ 27 ] ) , @xmath34 bit for @xmath35 and @xmath36 bit ( @xmath37 is the euler constant ) for @xmath38 .",
    "thus , at any space dimension @xmath29 , @xmath39 , i.e. quantum uncertainty reduces the effective number of distinguishable states even below a value of two corresponding to one bit .",
    "this is caused by high quantum uncertainty in pure states @xmath40 , which , on the one hand , are analogs of deterministic classical states when only their orthogonal sets are considered and , on the other hand , contain internal quantum uncertainty . in the latter case",
    ", other nonorthogonal states may coexist and pure states determine the corresponding probability distributions @xmath41 for variables @xmath42 such that @xmath40 is not their eigenfunction . particularly ,",
    "the corresponding entropy of the @xmath43-partite state @xmath44 asymptotically approaches @xmath45 at @xmath46 , i.e. , the pure character of the state virtually does not influence the uncertainty of all of the quantum states .",
    "the mixed state @xmath47 exhibits the maximum uncertainty equal to @xmath45 bit .",
    "thus , the first specific feature of quantum information due to incompatibility of quantum states is the impossibility of extracting a noticeable information content with spaces of large dimension d without selecting states .",
    "quantum information always must be selected in transmission channels transforming a considerable information content in a distinguishable form .",
    "let us consider a simple example illustrating the qualitative characteristics of quantum systems due to incompatibility of all quantum states .",
    "suppose two two - level atoms are in one and the same state ( fig .",
    "while the operational sense of the expression _ in one and the same state _ is quite clear , its qualitative sense essentially does not coincide with that of this expression in the classical case . when this example is considered from the classical standpoint , only two basis states ( @xmath48 ) of each atom",
    "are taken into account .",
    "then , when describing the statistic of these atom states , it makes no difference whether they are assumed to correspond to different atoms or to one and the same atom .",
    "the point is that , in a combined system , only one state has a nonzero probability and the knowledge of state @xmath49 of each atom corresponds to the exact knowledge of a possible state of the other atom .",
    "thus , when only populations are considered in the classical case , atoms can be equivalent copies of each other .    in the quantum case , it is impossible to copy all quantum states in a similar manner .",
    "in addition to the above two states in an atom , there exist other states @xmath0 with nonzero probabilities @xmath50 such that @xmath51 is not the proper basis for averaged physical quantities .",
    "this circumstance is due to quantum uncertainty , which is always present in an ensemble of quantum states ( fig .",
    "it is well known that , for a harmonic oscillator , this uncertainty manifests itself in nonzero energy of vacuum fluctuations @xmath52 . for two - level atoms",
    ", it takes the form of nonzero values @xmath53 , where pauli matrices @xmath54 have the sense of quadrature cosine and sine components of atom oscillators . in spite of the fact that these atoms are in one and the same state , their corresponding eigenstates are different because the above state refers to different physical systems .",
    "each of these systems contains its own ensemble of mutually incompatible quantum states , which are described by nonorthogonal eigenvectors corresponding to different noncommuting operators of physical variables as shown in fig",
    ". 1b . indeed , mean - square residuals @xmath55 and @xmath56 are nonzero because their operators do not commute with the operator of difference of populations @xmath57 which corresponds to strictly nonzero difference @xmath58 .",
    "this means that the eigenstates of these quantum variables for the atoms under consideration do not coincide , i.e. , all of their mutually corresponding quantum states are by no means copies of each other .",
    "this simple example implies the important general conclusion that , in the presence of incompatibility , i.e. , nonorthogonality in ensembles of quantum states of two different atoms , these ensembles are always different .",
    "hence , information on the states of a quantum system at a certain instant which is obtained by means of any other system considered at the same instant is never complete .",
    "complete quantum information on all quantum states of a system at a specified instant can be provided only by this system itself .",
    "the complete information content can appear in another place ( or at another instant ) when it is automatically cancelled at the initial position , which occurs , for example , during teleportation [ 2 ] .",
    "quantum information can be teleported only to a single receiver , which provides for the possibility of designing absolutely intercept - secure communication systems based on quantum cryptography .",
    "the above qualitative concept of uniqueness of quantum information can be justified quantitatively .",
    "let us consider the squared difference of projectors on the mutually corresponding wave functions of two atoms considered at one and the same instant .",
    "integrating the operator of this squared difference over all possible wave functions , we obtain the expression yielding a strictly positive value : @xmath59    where integration is performed over the bloch sphere including states @xmath0 with index @xmath60 , @xmath61 is a small volume element , and @xmath62 is the total volume of integration .",
    "this expression is similar to the corresponding classical formula for the rms discrepancy @xmath63    between classical indicators @xmath64 and @xmath64 of events @xmath65 and @xmath66 related with random variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for any joint probability distribution @xmath69 that describes random variables coinciding everywhere ,",
    "the mean of random function @xmath70 is zero , i.e. , for these probability distributions , all of the events @xmath65 and @xmath66 are realized simultaneously and the above quantities are copies of each other .",
    "being an exact quantum analog of the discrepancy between two ensembles of classical events , bipartite operator ( 2 ) has two proper subspaces which are formed of singlet and triplet bell states @xmath71 and correspond to the eigenvalues @xmath72 of the mean - square residual .",
    "the value corresponding to the singlet state is three times greater than the value corresponding to the triply degenerate triplet state .",
    "strict positivity of this operator , i.e. , the absence of the zero eigenvalue , means that , for any joint density matrix , its averaging yields a nonzero result , which determines the rms discrepancy of all quantum states .",
    "hence , it is impossible to mutually copy all quantum states of various systems irrespective of their states .",
    "= 0.3 = 0.3    the foregoing implies that the key difference between the classical and quantum types of information depends on whether the states associated with the information of interest are compatible or incompatible .",
    "the states of different systems considered at one and the same instant are always compatible .",
    "hence , in the presence of internally incompatible states , they can not copy each other , and the total ensembles of quantum states of one and the same system which are considered at two different instants are most often incompatible and , moreover , can copy each other in the absence of noise retaining the uniqueness of their quantum fluctuations at every instant .",
    "however , the states of two different systems observed at different instants may be compatible or incompatible depending on the transformation which couples these two instants .",
    "this factor is rather important for the basic definitions of quantitative quantum information measures ( see sections ii and iii ) .",
    "thus , according to the most fundamental classification of quantum information , which involves the compatibility / incompatibility property of state ensembles under consideration , the following four types of information can be recognized : classical information , semiclassical information , coherent information , and compatible information .    in the case of classical information ,",
    "all states are compatible and , within the original form of the shannon information theory , are considered as classical on default [ 21 , 22 ] . however , classical information can always be transmitted via a quantum channel and is of interest to quantum physicists as well . a classical channel is specified by conditional probability distribution @xmath73 of states of output @xmath74 at fixed states of input @xmath75 .    for semiclassical information ,",
    "all input information is specified by classical states @xmath76 and output states are characterized by internal quantum incompatibility as quantum states in hilbert space @xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , output states are automatically compatible with input states . in the general case ,",
    "a quantum channel is described by an ensemble of mixed quantum states @xmath77 depending on classical parameter @xmath76 [ 28 , 29 ] .",
    "variables @xmath76 are equivalent to input variables @xmath75 the set of all wave functions @xmath78 is equivalent to output states @xmath74 , and the density matrix of @xmath77 is equivalent to conditional probability distribution @xmath73 of a classical channel .    in the case of coherent information ,",
    "the spaces of input and output states are characterized by internal quantum incompatibility .",
    "being related by channel superoperator @xmath79 , which transforms the input density matrix to the output density @xmath80 [ 30 , 31 ] , these spaces are mutually incompatible .",
    "transformation @xmath81 determines the flow of quantum incompatible states transmitted from the channel input to output and is a completely quantum analog of classical conditional distribution @xmath73 , which , in a similar manner , linearly transforms classical input probability distribution @xmath82 to output distribution @xmath83 .    in the case of compatible information ,",
    "the input and output contain internally incompatible states but are mutually compatible .",
    "while the first three types of information and the coherent information measure ( which was introduced not long ago ) are well known [ 22 , 28 , 30 ] , compatible information has been introduced in an explicit form most recently as a special type of information measure [ 32 ] .",
    "it is determined for a combined bipartite system with the compatible input and output characterized by internal quantum incompatibility .",
    "coherent and compatible types of information com - prise all possible qualitatively different types of information in completely quantum channels .",
    "our study of possibilities provided by applying the information approach to actual experiments shows that only compatible information is an adequate tool for analyzing the information efficiency of an abstract scheme of a quantum - physical experiment .",
    "according to the classification presented in section i , one possible quantitative information measure for a completely quantum channel is coherent information introduced by schumacher and lloyd [ 30 , 31 ] .",
    "it serves as a quantitative measure of incompatible information content that is transmitted from one state space to another .",
    "one can consider both the case of one and the same state space and the case of physically different spaces .",
    "a trivial case of coherent information exchange is the dynamic evolution of a closed system described by unitary operator @xmath84 : @xmath85 . here ,",
    "all pure states @xmath40 admissible by initial density matrix @xmath86 are transmitted unchanged and transmitted coherent information content @xmath87 coincides with the initial information content . by definition",
    ", the latter is measured with the von neumann entropy @xmath88= s[\\hat\\rho_a]$ ] , i.e. , the corresponding information is described by the expression @xmath89    however , this definition requires additional reasoning in terms of the operational sense of the density matrix . in the self - consistent theory ,",
    "this matrix is only a result of averaging the pure state of a combined system over auxiliary variables .",
    "then , expression ( 3 ) must be considered as the entanglement of input system @xmath90 and reference system @xmath91 for properly chosen pure state @xmath92 ( such that @xmath93 ) of combined system @xmath94 .",
    "thus , coherent information is measured in terms of mutually compatible states of two different systems @xmath90 and @xmath91 . at the same time",
    ", information is transferred from input @xmath90 to output @xmath95 , the latter differing from @xmath90 by a unitary transformation only .",
    "information channel @xmath79 with corresponding noisy environment @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "2a ) must be included in the information system , which completes the description of its general structure [ 33 ] .",
    "= 0.35 = 0.45    coherent information for a channel of the general type is defined as follows [ 33 ] : @xmath97-s\\bigl[({\\cal n}{\\otimes}{\\cal i}){\\mathop{\\left|{\\psi_{ar}}\\right.\\rangle}\\nolimits } { \\mathop{\\langle\\left.{\\psi_{ar}}\\right|}\\nolimits}\\bigr],\\ ] ]    which is in agreement with the shannon definition of classical information [ 34 ] . here , @xmath98 is the unit superoperator which is applied to the variables of the reference system leaving them unchanged .",
    "the second term in this expression describes the exchange entropy , which is nonzero only due to the interaction between subsystems @xmath94 and @xmath96 when @xmath99 .",
    "superoperator @xmath79 transforms , according to the relationships @xmath100    the states of input @xmath90 into the states of output @xmath95 , whose quantum states are compatible with the states of reference system @xmath91 as before because these systems are not entangled due to the above transformation .",
    "this enables one to consider @xmath95 and @xmath91 as kinematically independent systems described by joint density matrix @xmath101 . taking into account the above circumstance and the zero , by supposition",
    ", entropy of combined system @xmath102 , relationship ( 4 ) can be considered as the measure of entanglement between output b and combined system @xmath103 decreased by the entropy of exchange between the channel @xmath104 and noisy environment @xmath96 .",
    "thus , it follows from ( 4 ) that , in terms of physical content , coherent information is a specific measure of preserved entanglement between compatible systems @xmath91 and @xmath90 ( remaining after information is transmitted through the channel @xmath104 ) rather than that it directly serves as a measure of quantum incompatible state flow transmitted from @xmath90 to @xmath95 . in the general case , output @xmath95 may be physically different from @xmath90 and even may be described by a hilbert space of quite different dimension ( @xmath105 ) [ 35 , 36 ] , which is illustrated by the physical example of the information system presented in fig . 2b .    for this system , input @xmath90 and reference system @xmath91 correspond to the ground two - level states of two entangled atom @xmath106-systems .",
    "information channel @xmath79 is provided by laser excitation of input system @xmath90 at the radiation - active upper level .",
    "combined with the vacuum state , two emitted photons correspond to output @xmath95 , whereas all of the remaining freedom degrees of the field combined with the excited atom state form noisy environment @xmath96 .",
    "the elementary carrier of quantum information is a two - level system , an analog of the classical bit which is conventionally called a qubit .. ] therefore , it is logical to call the quantitative measure of specifically quantum coherent information a qubit too .",
    "obviously , this unit of coherent information corresponds to the use of a binary logarithm in definition ( 3 ) , which yields @xmath107 qubit for a two - level system with density matrix @xmath108 characterizing the state with the maximum possible quantum entropy . with this state ,",
    "all possible quantum states are presented equally and most completely .",
    "now , let us find out how the quantitative measure of quantum information can be used in physics .",
    "the quantum theory usually is applied to calculations of certain means of the form @xmath109 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator @xmath16 .",
    "this decomposition is the result of averaging physical quantities represented in terms of probabilities @xmath110 of quantum states @xmath20 .",
    "all possible variables constitute an infinite set that is much richer than the set of all quantum states .",
    "therefore , irrespective of physical values , relationships between physical states provide for more general information on physical couplings in a more compact form .",
    "the characteristic features of the coherent information exchange correspond to physical relationships expressed in the most general form because they are associated with the most general properties of interaction between two quantum systems chosen as an input and output and related by a one - to - one transformation of all possible mixed input states .",
    "actually , the dependence of coherent information on the parameters of an information system is of even more fundamental character than relationships between specific physical quantities .",
    "this dependence is calculated for a number of fundamental models widely applied in quantum physics [ 3436 ] .    as an example , let us consider the well - known dicke problem [ 37 ] , where the information exchange between atoms demonstrates the dynamics of the same oscillation type [ 35 ] as the energy exchange via emitted photons , which determines radiation damping in a system of two two - level atoms . in this case , the oscillation dynamics is typical of not only energy but also the set of other variables .",
    "hence , in order to describe the general properties of interatomic interaction , it is expedient to consider coherent information as a measure of pre - served entanglement rather than the set of various physical variables .",
    "the former is a characteristic of the internal quantum incompatibility exchange between mutually compatible state sets of the reference and input systems @xmath111 and @xmath112 . in the dicke problem",
    ", information exhibits its coherent character in the time dependence at a large difference between decay rates of the short - and long - lived dicke states .",
    "the interatomic exchange coherence is realized by coherent oscillations between both of these components .",
    "therefore , the lifetime of coherent information is determined by the short - lived component in contrast to , for example , the lifetime of the atom population determined by the long - lived state .",
    "unlike the other types of quantum information , coherent information enables one to distinguish two qualitatively different information exchange classes corresponding to the cases when classical information or quantum state entanglement is used . only in the latter case ,",
    "coherent information is nonzero .",
    "therefore , it is just coherent information which can be adequately used for finding out to what extent a quantum information transmission channel retains the capability of utilizing the output as an input equivalent for realizing situations where the quantum character of an input signal is of essential importance .",
    "these problems are widely covered in the modern literature ( see [ 13 ] and references cited therein ) .",
    "being a measure of the entanglement of a quantum system that is preserved by a physical transformation , coherent information is now of certain practical interest for quantum information transmission and processing as well as for the analysis of specific physical models of quantum channels illustrated below by an example .",
    "proceeding from formal mathematical analogues , we can start describing a two - sided quantum information channel with the formal quantum generalization of the shannon classical mutual information @xmath113 : @xmath114 + s[\\hat\\rho_b]- s[\\hat \\rho_{ab}],\\ ] ]    this generalization makes sense only when joint density matrix @xmath115 is specified .",
    "this matrix is considered as a direct analog of classical joint probability distribution @xmath116 [ 38 ] .",
    "obviously , formula ( 6 ) can be applied to quantum systems if we assume that the states of systems @xmath90 and @xmath95 are mutually compatible .",
    "it is _ a fortiori _",
    "true for one - time states of the corresponding physical systems when they are not overlapped by the parts of one and the same quantum system containing both an input and output .. when systems move at relativistic velocities , the appropriate relativistic corrections are necessary . these situations are topical in modern experiments with entangled quantum states [ 39 ] where effects associated with motion of a measuring system are recorded . ]",
    "the foregoing justifies the term _ one - time _ as referred to information that is specified using the joint density matrix as an initial characteristic .",
    "though one can formally define quantum information @xmath117 with expression ( 6 ) , its physical sense remains to be seen [ 40 , 41 ] .",
    "this can be attributed to the main qualitative difference between the classical and quantum information channels . in general , relationship ( 5 ) implies that the quantum input and output are incompatible as , for example , in the case when the states of one and the same quantum system are considered at two different instants .",
    "thus , @xmath90 and @xmath95 in ( 6 ) can not be the input and output that are involved in the definition of coherent information .",
    "therefore , in the quantum case , in order to apply density matrix @xmath115 , one has to physically specify systems @xmath90 and @xmath95 .",
    "this can be done using the schumacher definition of coherent information , which inevitably necessitates modifying expression ( 6 ) .",
    "= 0.45    adequate physical interpretations of systems @xmath90 and @xmath95 are provided by identifying them , respectively , with the reference system and with the output of a certain quantum channel associated with specified joint density matrix @xmath115 as shown in fig .",
    "3 . in this case ,",
