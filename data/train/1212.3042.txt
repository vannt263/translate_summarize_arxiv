    "we use the molecular hubbard hamiltonian ( mhh ) to show that the first experiments with ultracold molecules in optical lattices will display a variety of many - body phases which are strongly dependent on molecular species and amenable to control with external fields .    for ultracold alkali atoms , interactions are well - modeled by a contact pseudopotential proportional to the @xmath6-wave scattering length , and",
