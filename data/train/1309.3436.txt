    "receptor trafficking has been identified as a key feature of synaptic transmission and plasticity @xcite . yet",
    ", the mode of trafficking remains unclear : after receptors are inserted in the plasma membrane of neuron , classical single particle tracking revealed that the motion can either be free or confined brownian motion @xcite .",
    "recently , super - resolution light optical microscopy techniques for _ in vivo _ data @xcite have allowed monitoring a large number of molecular trajectories at the single molecular level and at nanometer resolution . using a novel stochastic analysis approach @xcite , we have identified that high confined density regions are generated by large potential wells ( 100s of nanometers ) that sequester receptors . in addition , fluctuation in the apparent diffusion coefficient reflects the change in the local density of obstacles @xcite .",
    "classically , cell membranes are organized in local microdomains @xcite characterized by morphological and functional specificities . in neurons",
    "prominent microdomains include dendritic spines and synapses , which play a major role in neuronal communication . in this report",
    ", we analyze ampar , that are key in mediating transmission in excitatory glutamatergic transmission , are not only relocating between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites due to lateral diffusion @xcite , but can be trapped in transient ring structures that contain several potential wells .",
    "we identified three regions ( fig .",
    "1 ) where trajectories form rings ( fig .",
    "2a - b ) : specifically , a first feature that defines a ring is that receptor trajectories are constraint into an annulus type geometry ( fig .",
    "2c ) located on the surface of the membrane .",
    "however , rings are not necessarily localized within dendritic spines . to further characterize a ring",
    ", we use the stochastic analysis developed in @xcite , to compute the vector field for the drift , which is surprisingly restricted to an annulus ( fig .",
    "2b , ring 2 and 3 ) : the size of the inner radius is of the order of 500 nm while the external radius is around @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , inside a ring , we found several attracting potential wells of various sizes that co - localized with regions of high density ( fig .",
    "3a ) . from the density distribution function along the ring ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we identified three wells . while the ampars diffusion coefficient in these wells is around @xmath1 @xmath2m@xmath3/s ( fig .",
    "3b ) , the wells have an interaction range of about 500 nm ( fig .",
    "3c ) , and are associated with an energy of 3.6 @xmath4 , 1.8 @xmath4 and 3 @xmath4 respectively .    using time lapse imaging ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we could see that a ring can be stable over a period of 30 minutes ( ring 1 ) , while ring 2 was only stable for 15 minutes .",
    "interestingly , we could see a transient ring which creates a transient structure interconnecting two - ring like structures at time 45 minutes before it disappears at 60 minutes .",
    "ring 3 could be detected transiently after 15 minutes , containing multiple wells .    finally , focusing on ring 1 , by plotting the density function of trajectories",
    ", we could see over time how a potential well emerges , is destroyed as well as its stability ( fig .",
    "4a ) . while the diffusion coefficient remains constant over time ( fig .",
    "4b ) , the energy of the main well ( fig .",
    "4c ) changes across the time lapse experiments as follow : at time 30 min it is e = 6.6 kt ( score = 0.25 and a depth of a=2.0 ) , at the intermediate time 45 min , the energy is e= 7.8 kt ( score = 0.20 , depth a=2.3 ) and finally at time 60 minutes e = 5.2 kt ( score = 0.13 , depth a=1.6 ) .",
    "the weak score confirms the likelihood of the well @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the energy level of the well is neither weak and strong @xcite , but remains stable overtime .      to conclude , potential wells that reflect the interaction of ampa receptor with molecular partner are not only appearing isolated or at synapses @xcite , but can also appear in ring structures .",
    "although these rings can be due to latex bead , the organization of potential wells around in such vicinity suggest that membrane curvature could be a key necessary component to shape the strength of the wells .",
    "these rings can trap receptors in 100 nanometers structures .",
    "both potential wells and rings are transient , but stable over periods of minutes .",
    "classical physical modeling and statistical analysis of single receptor motion @xcite assumes that the main driving force is free or confined brownian motion .",
    "this is based on langevin s description of a pointwise stochastic object description .",
    "however because gradient forces , such as electrostatic forces , which are the main sources of chemical interactions can not generate close trajectories in the determinist limit of langevin s approximation , maintaining receptor in ring can not be due to electrostatic forces alone .",
    "thus we propose several hypothesis for this ring structure : one possibility is that receptor dynamics description can not be reduced to a single point and rather we have now to account for the complex structure of the protein that can generate interactions at specific protein group , which is decoupled from the center of mass . for example the c - terminus tail can interact with some supra - structure generated by scaffolding molecules .",
    "another possibility is that rings are due to transient geometrical structures on the membrane , which traps receptors .",
    "we could imagine that this is the case near an endosomal compartment during vesicular exocytosis and endocytosis @xcite .",
