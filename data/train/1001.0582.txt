    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) radiate the bulk of their large luminosities ( @xmath3 ) as infrared dust emission @xcite .",
    "their large infrared luminosities indicate that ( 1 ) powerful energy sources are present , hidden behind dust ; ( 2 ) energetic radiation from the hidden energy sources is absorbed by the surrounding dust ; and ( 3 ) the heated dust grains re - emit this energy as infrared thermal radiation . to understand this lirg population , it is essential to clarify the hidden energy sources , whether starbursts ( i.e. , nuclear fusion inside stars ) are dominant , or active galactic nuclei ( agns ; active mass accretion onto a central compact supermassive black hole [ smbh ] with @xmath210@xmath4m@xmath5 ) are also energetically important .    unlike agns surrounded by a torus - shaped (",
    "toroidally - shaped ) dusty medium , which are classified optically as seyferts @xcite , lirgs have a large amount of concentrated molecular gas and dust in their nuclei @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "the putative compact agns can easily be _ buried _",
    "( i.e. , obscured in virtually all directions ) , making the optical detection of agn signatures very difficult . however , investigating the energetic importance of such optically elusive _ buried _ agns is crucial to understand the true nature of the lirg population .",
    "a starburst ( nuclear fusion ) and a buried agn ( mass accretion onto a smbh ) have very different energy - generation mechanisms . specifically ,",
    "while uv is the predominant energetic radiation in a starburst , an agn emits strong x - ray emission in addition to uv .",
    "the radiative energy generation efficiency of a nuclear fusion reaction in a normal starburst is only @xmath60.5% of mc@xmath7 ( m is the mass of material used in the nuclear fusion reaction ) .",
    "thus , the emission surface brightness of a starburst region is modest and has both observational @xcite and theoretical @xcite upper limits ( @xmath610@xmath8l@xmath5 kpc@xmath9 ) .",
    "an agn , however , achieves high radiative energy generation efficiency ( 642% of mc@xmath7 , where m is the mass of accreting material ; bardeen 1970 ; thorne 1974 ) , producing a very high emission surface brightness with @xmath210@xmath8l@xmath5 kpc@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these differences between a starburst and an agn could create differences in the properties of the molecular gas and dust around the energy sources , allowing us to distinguish the hidden energy sources if , for example , different emission - line flux ratios are observed from the surrounding material .",
    "molecular gas emission lines in the sub - millimeter and millimeter wavelength ranges are a potentially effective tool for probing this distinction , because the effects of dust extinction are so small in these wavelength ranges that signatures of agns deeply buried in gas and dust are detectable .",
    "it was found observationally that hcn(@xmath0=10 ) emission ( rest frequency @xmath10 = 88.632 ghz or rest wavelength @xmath11 = 3.385 mm ) is systematically stronger , relative to hco@xmath1(@xmath0=10 ) ( @xmath10 = 89.189 ghz or @xmath11 = 3.364 mm ) , in agn - dominated galaxy nuclei than in starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the trend of a strong hcn(10 ) to hco@xmath1(10 ) emission ratio was further confirmed in luminous buried agn candidates @xcite .",
    "these results demonstrated that this hcn(10)/hco@xmath1(10 ) method functions as a diagnostic tool to distinguish the hidden energy sources of dusty galaxies .",
    "extension to more distant , faint lirgs is expected to play an important role for the comprehensive understanding of the lirg population in the forthcoming atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) era . however , during the first operation phase of alma , band 3 ( 84116 ghz or 2.593.57 mm ) is the longest available wavelength coverage , so that this hcn(10)/hco@xmath1(10 ) method can be applied only to lirgs at @xmath12 0.05 , hampering further systematic investigation of lirgs .",
    "energy diagnostic methods using other transition lines and/or other molecular species must be exploited .",
    "hcn(@xmath0=43 ) ( @xmath10 = 354.505 ghz ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) ( @xmath10 = 356.734 ghz ) lines exist in earth s 350 ghz atmospheric window , and can be one of the main frequency ranges exploited with alma . because the frequency coverage of alma band 7 is 275373 ghz , hcn(43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 )",
    "lines can be studied in lirgs at @xmath13 0.05 .",
    "thus it is important to investigate whether agns show high hcn(43 ) to hco@xmath1(43 ) flux ratios , similar to the high hcn(10 ) to hco@xmath1(10 ) flux ratios .    in this paper , we present the results of simultaneous hcn(43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) observations of two nearby , well - studied lirgs , ngc 4418 and arp 220 , both of which show high hcn(10 ) to hco@xmath1(10 ) flux ratios @xcite . throughout this paper ,",

    ", we observed a strong emission line in w28 ( irc10216 ) at the frequency of the red - shifted hcn(43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) lines of ngc 4418 ( arp 220 ) , to estimate the possible sensitivity variation along the whsf bandpass .",
    "this variation was found to be @xmath2520% .",
    "the half - power beam width of the aste 10-m dish was 22@xmath24 at @xmath26 @xmath6 345 ghz . at this frequency , the main beam efficiency is 0.6 , and 1 k in antenna temperature corresponds to 78.5 jy .    data reduction was carried out with newstar , a package developed at nobeyama radio observatory .",
    "a fraction of poor - quality data was flagged . to estimate the strength of hcn(43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) emission , we subtracted baselines from the obtained raw spectra .",
    "we first divided the spectra into two parts at the center , the lower - frequency hcn(43 ) part and higher - frequency hco@xmath1(43 ) part .",
    "the baseline was estimated independently in each part , based on the data points free from emission lines .    for ngc 4418 ,",
    "ten data sets with 20 min net on - source exposure time for each were obtained .",
    "the behavior of the baseline was extremely good , and the hcn(43 ) emission line was easily recognizable in individual data sets .",
    "first - order linear baselines were adopted both for the hcn(43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) emission lines , and the baseline - subtracted individual spectra were summed to obtain final spectra .",
    "for arp 220 , final data consist of seven data sets with 20 min net on - source exposure and one data set with 15 min net on - source exposure . for the hcn(43 )",
    "line , first - order linear baselines were adopted in individual data sets , and the baseline - subtracted individual spectra were summed . the hcn(43 ) emission line was detected in the final spectrum ( see appendix for more detail ) .",
    "although we tried several baseline fits , the hcn(43 ) emission line was always visible , and its profile was virtually unchanged in the final spectrum , under reasonable baseline choices . for the hco@xmath1(43 )",
    "line , when we applied a first - order linear baseline , winding patterns remained in the final spectrum , and hco@xmath1(43 ) line was not clearly detected .",
    "we thus attempted a second - order baseline , but the hco@xmath1(43 ) emission line remained undetected in the final spectrum .",

    "for the undetected hco@xmath1(43 ) emission , we adopted the lowest plausible continuum level in the spectra , and estimated conservative upper limits , by counting the possible flux excess above the adopted continuum levels .",

    "the non - detection of hco@xmath1(43 ) emission lines hampered the spectral separation into arp 220 e and w and rendered independent estimates of the line flux ratio for these nuclear components difficult .",
    "hcn(43)/hco@xmath1(43 ) flux ratios significantly higher than unity were confirmed in both galaxies .",

    ". this level of absolute flux calibration uncertainty can be fatal to an investigation of the hcn(43 ) to hco@xmath1(43 ) flux ratios because we are discussing the difference of the ratios by about a factor of 2 . by simultaneously observing hcn(43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) lines",
    ", the possible absolute flux calibration uncertainty does not propagate to the hcn(43)/hco@xmath1(43 ) flux ratios , which are then dominated only by statistical noises and fitting errors .",
    "in this subsection , we explore hcn(43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) emission from ngc 4418 and arp 220 , in relation to hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath1(10 ) . for this purpose",
    ", we used our aste whsf and nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) data @xcite , because ( 1 ) simultaneous hcn and hco@xmath1 observations by both telescopes make the comparison of hcn to hco@xmath1 flux ratios reliable , and ( 2 ) hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath1(10 ) absolute fluxes in the nma data have been confirmed to agree with measurements from other single - dish telescopes @xcite .",

    "the hcn(43 ) to hcn(10 ) flux ratio was estimated to be 20 .",

    "the @xmath0 = 43 to @xmath0 = 10 flux ratio for arp 220 total emission was 12 and @xmath258 for hcn and hco@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "when we separated the emission from individual nuclei , the hcn(43 ) to hcn(10 ) flux ratios were 21 and 9 for arp 220 e and w nuclei , respectively .",
    "the ratio is higher in arp 220 e than arp 220 w , further supporting the previous argument that a larger fraction of highly excited molecular gas is present in arp 220 e @xcite .",
    "the critical density of hcn is 2.3 @xmath21 10@xmath29 @xmath30 for @xmath0 = 10 and 8.5 @xmath21 10@xmath4 @xmath30 for @xmath0 = 43 . that of hco@xmath1 is 3.4 @xmath21 10@xmath31 @xmath30 for @xmath0 = 10 , and 1.8 @xmath21 10@xmath4 @xmath30 for @xmath0 = 43 ( table 3 of greve et al .",
    "2009 ) . because the critical density of hco@xmath1 is a factor of @xmath657 smaller than hcn for both the @xmath0 = 10 and @xmath0 = 43 transitions ,",
    "hco@xmath1 can be collisionally excited more easily than hcn in single - phase molecular gas .",
    "thus , the stronger hcn emission in ngc 4418 and arp 220 requires ( 1 ) an hcn abundance that is significantly higher than hco@xmath1 , and/or ( 2 ) the presence of some physical mechanism that enhances hcn emission .    regarding the first hcn abundance enhancement scenario ,",
    "@xcite concluded , based on three - dimensional line transfer simulations , that hcn abundance must be an order of magnitude higher than hco@xmath1 to account for the observed high hcn to hco@xmath1 flux ratio ( @xmath62 ) . while the typical hcn to hco@xmath1 abundance ratio in our galactic molecular cloud is @xmath61 @xcite , hcn overabundance , relative to hco@xmath1 , by an order of magnitude ,",
    "is predicted in some parameter range for dense molecular gas illuminated by an x - ray emitting energy source @xcite .",
    "since an agn is a much stronger x - ray emitter than starburt activity , this hcn overabundance scenario is a possibility for the observed high hcn(43)/hco@xmath1(43 ) flux ratios in the buried agn candidates , ngc 4418 and arp 220 .",
    "strong hcn emission in luminous buried agn candidates may be explained by the infrared radiative pumping scenario @xcite . in an agn ,",
    "the emission surface brightness is much higher than in a starburst , so that the surrounding dust is heated to a high temperature ( several hundred k ) and produces strong mid - infrared 1020 @xmath32 m continuum emission .",
    "the hcn molecule has a line at infrared 14.0 @xmath32 m .",
    "molecular gas around an agn can be vibrationally excited by absorbing these infrared 14.0 @xmath32 m photons , and through the subsequent cascade process , can enhance hcn rotational lines in the sub - millimeter and millimeter range .",
    "@xcite suggested that this infrared pumping scenario may work also for hco@xmath1 and hnc , because they have lines at 12.1 @xmath32 m ( hco@xmath1 ) and 21.7 @xmath32 m ( hnc ) .",
    "however , for this infrared pumping scenario to affect particular molecules , infrared photons at the wavelengths of these molecular lines must be absorbed .",
    "namely , absorption features must be detected in infrared spectra at 14.0 @xmath32 m ( hcn ) , 12.1 @xmath32 m ( hco@xmath1 ) , and 21.7 @xmath32 m ( hnc ) . while the infrared hcn 14.0 @xmath32 m absorption feature",
    "is clearly detected in highly obscured ultraluminous infrared galaxies , including ngc 4418 and arp 220 @xcite , absorption features at hco@xmath1 12.1 @xmath32 m and hnc 21.7 @xmath32 m are not @xcite .",
    "therefore , we see observational signatures that this infrared radiative pumping scenario could be at work for hcn , but not for hco@xmath1 or hnc .",
    "this may explain the strong hcn emission found in luminous agn candidates .",
    "since both the hcn overabundance and infrared radiative pumping scenarios could work more effectively in an agn than starburst activity , the enhanced hcn(43 ) emission may originate in putative buried agns in ngc 4418 and arp 220 .",
    "three - dimensional modelings which realistically incorporate actual physical parameters of molecular gas around an agn are needed for more detailed quantitative comparison with observations .      for ngc 4418 , the hcn(43 ) to hcn(10 )",
    "flux ratio ( 20 ) was higher than the hco@xmath1(43 ) to hco@xmath1(10 ) flux ratio ( @xmath2515 ) . for arp 220",
    "as well , the former ratio ( 12 ) was higher than the latter ratio ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "thus , our aste observations suggest that @xmath0 = 43 transition lines are excited more efficiently in hcn than hco@xmath1 , in spite of the higher critical density of hcn(43 ) compared to hco@xmath1(43 ) ( a factor of @xmath65 [ @xmath335.1 ] ) . as mentioned in @xmath335.1 , in a single - phase molecular gas , molecular species with lower critical density",

    "<S> we report the results of hcn(@xmath0=43 ) and hco@xmath1(@xmath0=43 ) observations of two luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) , ngc 4418 and arp 220 , made using the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) . </S>",
    "<S> the aste wide - band correlator provided simultaneous observations of hcn(43 ) and hco@xmath1(43 ) lines , and a precise determination of their flux ratios . </S>",
    "<S> both galaxies showed high hcn(43 ) to hco@xmath1(43 ) flux ratios of @xmath22 , possibly due to agn - related phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 = 43 to @xmath0 = 10 transition flux ratios for hcn ( hco@xmath1 ) are similar to those expected for fully thermalized ( sub - thermally excited ) gas in both sources , in spite of hcn s higher critical density . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume collisional excitation and neglect an infrared radiative pumping process , our non - lte analysis suggests that hcn traces gas with significantly higher density than hco@xmath1 . in arp 220 </S>",
    "<S> , we separated the double - peaked hcn(43 ) emission into the eastern and western nuclei , based on velocity information . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed that the eastern nucleus showed a higher hcn(43 ) to hcn(10 ) flux ratio , and thus contained a larger amount of highly excited molecular gas than the western nucleus . </S>"
