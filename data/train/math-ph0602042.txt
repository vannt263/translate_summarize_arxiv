    "over the past 30 years , much effort has been devoted to calculations of the renormalised stress - energy tensor in ground states of quantum fields on stationary background spacetimes .",
    "many analogous calculations have been made in flat spacetime equipped with reflecting boundaries , in connection with the casimir effect .",
    "however , it would be fair to say that only limited qualititative insight has been gained .",
    "for example , the energy density is sometimes positive , and sometimes negative and there is no known way of predicting the sign in any general situations without performing the full calculations   ( see , however ,   for a situation where the sign can be predicted ) .",
    "at least analytically , these calculations are restricted to cases exhibiting a high degree of symmetry .",
    "the aim of this paper , and a companion paper  @xcite , is to point out that there are situations in which one may gain some qualitative insight into the possible magnitude of the stress - energy tensor based on simple geometric considerations .",
    "the situation we study in this paper arises when a spacetime contains a subspacetime which is isometric to ( a subspacetime of ) another spacetime , which will usually have nontrivial symmetries . by using quantum energy inequalities ( qeis ) together with the locality properties of quantum field theory",
    ", we are then able to use information about the second ( symmetric ) spacetime to yield information about the stress - energy tensor of states on the first spacetime ( which need have no global symmetries ) in the region where the isometry holds .",
    "we will work on globally hyperbolic spacetimes in this paper , deferring the issue of spacetimes with boundary to a companion paper  @xcite .",
    "as well as setting out the theory behind the method , we will demonstrate it in several locally minkowskian spacetimes .",
    "marecki  @xcite has also illustrated our approach , by considering the case of spacetimes locally isometric to portions of exterior schwarzschild .",
    "also begun here for the free massless scalar field is a similar discussion for conformally related regions of two - dimensional spacetimes . in a separate paper",
    "we will extend this to the generalised maxwell field in higher dimensional manifolds related by conformal diffeomorphisms .    to be more specific , consider a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath0 , consisting of a manifold of dimension @xmath1 , a lorentzian metric with signature @xmath2 , and choices of orientation and time - orientation ( which , together , are required to fulfill the demands of global hyperbolicity ) .",

    "@xmath51 is the renormalised stress - energy tensor defined in a manner compatible with wald s axioms @xcite , and we have adopted the convention that the same tensor may be written @xmath52 ( without indices ) or @xmath53 ( with ) .",
    "we will permit @xmath40 to include tensors singularly supported on timelike curves or other submanifolds of spacetime , so , for example , we can treat worldline averages such as @xmath54 where @xmath10 is a smooth timelike curve parametrised by an open interval @xmath55 of proper time @xmath56 , with velocity @xmath57 , and for @xmath58 .",
    "[ to be precise , @xmath40 is required to be a set of compactly supported distributions on smooth rank two covariant test tensor fields . ]",

    "have been studied ; it has been found that replacing @xmath37 by a scaled version @xmath61 has the effect of sending the qei bound to zero as @xmath62 ( or faster , for massive fields ) as @xmath63 , where @xmath60 is the spacetime dimension .",
    "difference qei bounds also involve the specification of @xmath40 and @xmath41 as before , but now the bound sought takes the form @xmath64 f^{ab } \\,{d{\\rm vol}}\\ge -{{\\mathcal q}}({{\\sf f}},\\omega_0)>-\\infty\\ , , \\label{eq : qidiff}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is called the reference state . if the theory were represented in a fock space built on @xmath65 ( when this is possible ) the left - hand side would be an average of the normal ordered stress - energy tensor .",
    "however it is not always necessary to assume that @xmath14 and @xmath65 are represented in this way .",
    "difference qeis have proved to be the easiest to establish in curved spacetimes , or where boundaries are present .",
    "first developed in the case of ( ultra)static spacetimes with the ( ultra)static ground state chosen as the reference state @xmath65  , they are now known for scalar , spin-@xmath66 , and spin-@xmath67 fields in arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes  . in these general results , @xmath41 is the class of hadamard states and the bounds are sufficiently general that @xmath65 may be any element of @xmath41 , so @xmath49 becomes a function @xmath68 .",
    "the general results do not make use of a hilbert space representation .    clearly , difference and absolute qeis are quite closely related .",
    "in particular , wald s fourth axiom requires @xmath69 to vanish identically if @xmath65 is the minkowski vacuum , so difference qeis become absolute in this case .",
    "[ the extension of this observation to locally minkowskian spaces is a key idea in this paper . ]",
    "more generally , we may convert a difference qei to an absolute qei by moving all the terms in @xmath65 onto the right - hand side . in cases",
    "where the renormalised stress - energy tensor is known explicitly for the reference state , this is perfectly satisfactory .",
    "however , there are two ( related ) drawbacks : ( i ) there is no canonical choice of reference state @xmath65 in a general spacetime ( which might have no timelike killing fields , for example ) ; ( ii ) one does not normally have available a closed form expression for @xmath70 for _ any _ state on a general spacetime , so the qei bound becomes somewhat inexplicit .",
    "this weakens the power of qeis to constrain exotic spacetime configurations such as macroscopic traversable wormholes or ` warp drive ' .",
    "( on sufficiently small scales , one expects that the absolute qei bounds should strongly resemble those of minkowski space  as first argued in , and proven in various situations in @xcite and  @xcite  however one still needs to know the magnitude of @xmath69 to know on what scales this approximation holds . )",
    "the present paper and its companion represent first steps towards absolute qeis in more general spacetimes , starting with spacetimes containing regions isometric to others where reference states are known .",
    "work is under way on generally applicable absolute qeis and will be reported elsewhere ; however we expect the results and methods presented here to be of continuing interest , as they reduce to very simple geometrical conditions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qeis_and_lc ] we give a brief introduction to some of the relevant notions of locally covariant quantum field theory before defining locally covariant qeis and developing their simple properties in sec .  [ sec : qei_loc_cov ] .",
    "the following two subsections show how existing qeis in the literature may be expressed in the locally covariant framework , and address some technical points along the way . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general_apps ] we show how local covariance permits _ a priori _ bounds to be placed on energy densities in spacetimes with minkowskian subspacetimes using geometric data .",
    "the main technique here , in addition to local covariance , is the conversion of qeis to eigenvalue problems , first introduced in  .",
    "these are applied in sec .",
    "[ sec : specific_apps ] to specific spacetime models where the energy densities of ground- and thermal states are known , permitting comparison with our _ a priori _ bounds . in some cases these bounds",
    "are saturated by the exact values . after a summary ,",

    "isometric embedding _ of @xmath71 in @xmath72 is a smooth map @xmath76 which is a diffeomorphism of @xmath77 onto its range @xmath78 in @xmath79 and so that the pull - back @xmath80 is everywhere equal to @xmath81 on @xmath77 . in local coordinates",

    "there are two possible choices of orientation and time orientation on @xmath78 : that induced by @xmath11 from the ( time-)orientation of @xmath71 , and that inherited from @xmath72 .",
    "if these coincide and we have the further property that every causal curve in @xmath72 with endpoints in @xmath78 lies entirely in @xmath78 , then we say that @xmath11 is a _ causal isometric embedding_. an important class of examples arises where @xmath71 is a causally embedded globally hyperbolic subspacetime ( c.e.g.h.s . ) of @xmath72 as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : int_summary ] , in which case @xmath11 is simply the identity map .",
    "it is also worth mentioning an example of a non - causal embedding , namely , the ` helical strip ' described by kay  @xcite . in this example a long thin diamond region of two dimensional minkowski space",
    "is isometrically embedded in a ` timelike cylinder ' which is the quotient of minkowski space by a spacelike translation .",
    "the wrapping is arranged so that points which are spacelike separated in the original diamond are timelike separated in the geometry of the timelike cylinder .",
    "the definition of a causal embedding is designed precisely to ensure that the induced and inherited causal structures can not differ in this way .",
    "the relevance of local covariance to quantum field theory on manifolds has long been understood  @xcite but has recently been put in a new setting by brunetti , fredenhagen and verch  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and  ) and related work of hollands and wald ( see , e.g. ,  ) .",
    "this provides a very elegant and general framework for local covariance in the language of category theory .",

    ", we will restrict ourselves to the klein ",
    "gordon field of mass @xmath85 , although similar comments can be made for the dirac , maxwell , and proca fields .",
    "there is a well - defined quantisation of the theory on any globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath5 , in terms of an algebra of observables @xmath86 and a space of hadamard states @xmath87 which determine expectation values for observables in @xmath86",
    ". for the purposes of this section , it suffices to know that @xmath86 is generated by smeared field objects @xmath88 labelled by smooth , compactly supported test functions @xmath89 , subject to relations expressing the field equation and commutation relations , and the hermiticity of the field .",
    "( the structure is given in detail in appendix  [ appdx : locally_covar_qft ] . )",
    "the hadamard states of the theory are those states on @xmath86 whose two - point functions have singularities of the hadamard form , which at leading order are just those of the minkowski vacuum two - point function .",
    "more precisely  , on any causal normal neighbourhood @xmath90 in @xmath5 there is a sequence of bidistributions @xmath91 so that ( for any @xmath92 ) the two - point function of any hadamard state differs from @xmath91 on @xmath90 by a state - dependent function of class @xmath93 .",
    "it is of key importance that @xmath94 is fixed entirely by the local metric and causal structure , through the hadamard recursion relations .",
    "given a hadamard state @xmath14 , we may construct the expected renormalised stress - energy tensor @xmath95 by the point - splitting technique ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) : first subtract @xmath91 from the two - point function ( for @xmath96 ) , then apply appropriate derivatives before taking the points together again .",
    "next , one subtracts a term of the form @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is locally determined ( and state - independent ) , in order to ensure that the resulting tensor is conserved and vanishes in the minkowski vacuum state .",
    "the tensor defined in this way obeys wald s axioms mentioned above ; however , these axioms would also be satisfied if one were to add a conserved local curvature term .",
    "such terms are sometimes described as undetermined or arbitrary ; we take the view , however , that they are part of the specification of the theory , just as the mass and conformal coupling are , even though they do not appear explicitly in the lagrangian ( a similar attitude is expressed in  ) . for simplicity , and because our main applications will concern locally minkowskian spacetimes , we will assume that these terms are absent  that is , we restrict to those scalar particle species for which this is the case .",
    "the above structure is locally covariant in the following sense .",
    "suppose a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath5 is embedded in a globally hyperbolic spacetimes @xmath0 by a causal isometry @xmath11 , and let @xmath99 denote the push - forward map on test functions .",
    "that is , @xmath100 is defined by @xmath101 then there is a natural mapping of the field on @xmath5 to the field on @xmath0 given by @xmath102 ; we also write this as @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , @xmath99 can be extended to any element of @xmath86 , respecting the algebraic relations and mapping the identity in @xmath86 to the identity in @xmath104 ; technically , it is a unit - preserving injective @xmath105-homomorphism of @xmath86 into @xmath104 .    on account of the correspondence @xmath102 , we say that the field is covariant [ the transformation goes ` in the same direction ' as @xmath11 ; see the remarks below on the underlying category theory at the end of appendix  [ appdx : locally_covar_qft ] ] .",
    "by contrast , the state spaces transform in a contravariant way [ in the ` opposite direction ' to @xmath11 ] : for any state @xmath14 on @xmath104 there is a pulled - back state , which we denote @xmath107 , on @xmath86 , so that the expectation values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 are related by @xmath110 the use of pull - back notation may be justified by the observation that eq .",
    "entails that the @xmath92-point functions of the two states are related by @xmath111 ( adopting an ` unsmeared ' notation ) .",
    "that is , the @xmath92-point function of @xmath107 is simply the pull - back of the @xmath92-point function of @xmath14 by @xmath11 ( or more precisely , by the duplication of @xmath11 across @xmath92 copies of @xmath5 ) .",
    "this has an important consequence when the state @xmath14 is hadamard , i.e. , @xmath112 : because the hadamard condition is based on the local metric and causal structure , both of which are preserved by @xmath11 , it is clear that @xmath107 is also hadamard .",
    "( a more elegant proof of this  @xcite is to use radzikowski s characterisation of the hadamard condition in terms of the wave - front set of the two - point function  @xcite , and the transformation properties of the wave - front set under pull - backs . )",
    "this may be expressed by the inclusion @xmath113 .    as noted above , the expectation values of the stress - energy tensor",
    "is also constructed in a purely local fashion from the two - point function of the state .",
    "it therefore follows that @xmath114 where we have written @xmath84 : like the @xmath92-point functions , the expected stress - energy tensor in state @xmath107 is simply the pull - back of that in state @xmath14 . in coordinate - free notation",
    "we may write @xmath115 in the above equations we have written the stress - energy tensor as if it is an element of the algebra @xmath86 , which it is not .",
    "one may proceed in two ways : either interpreting eq .   as the extension of eq .   to an algebra of wick polynomials which contains @xmath86 as a subalgebra , and in which @xmath116 may be defined as a locally covariant field  . for our purposes , however , it will be simpler to define the smeared stress - energy tensor only through its expectation values ; more technically , we think of it as a linear functional on the space of hadamard states , with the notation @xmath117 expressing the value of this functional applied to the state @xmath14 .",
    "this has the advantage that one may deal with all hadamard states , rather than those which extend to the wick algebra  .",
    "we emphasise the fact that states are pulled back in this setting ; although one could push forward a state @xmath118 to obtain a state on @xmath119 , there is no guarantee that this can be extended to a hadamard state on @xmath104 , and indeed , such extensions do not always exist .",
    "for example , the rindler vacuum state on the rindler wedge is hadamard in the interior of the wedge  , but can not be extended to a hadamard state on the whole of minkowski because its stress - energy tensor diverges at the boundary of the wedge .",
