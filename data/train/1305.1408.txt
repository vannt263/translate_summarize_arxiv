    "a galactic disc is believed to be embedded in a dark matter halo , but the actual shape of the dark matter halo is not yet well - understood .",
    "usually , the halo is taken to be spherical for simplicity , or oblate .",
    "when a deviation from sphericity is considered at all , typically an oblate shape is used ( e.g. , sackett & sparke 1990 ) . a prolate halo has been used in a few cases , e.g. to study warps in galaxies ( sparke 1994 , ideta et al .",
    "2000 ) , and to explain the tidal streaming in the galaxy ( helmi 2004 ) . in these",
    "the axis ratio is taken to be constant , again for simplicity .",
    "recently , it was shown that the dark matter halo in the milky way is prolate with the vertical - to - planar axis ratio monotonically increasing to 2.0 at 24 kpc ( banerjee & jog 2011 ) .",
    "this was obtained by modeling the observed steeply flaring atomic hydrogen gas layer in the outer galaxy , where the gas is supported by pressure against the net gravitational field of the disc and the halo .",
    "it is then natural to ask what would be the dynamical consequences of such a progressively prolate halo .",
    "this is the motivation for the present paper .",
    "n - body simulations of galaxies show that the dark matter halo is triaxial . along the cartesian cuts ( x - y , or x - z ) , the halos show a range of value from oblate to prolate with a preference for a prolate shape ( bailin & steinmetz 2005 , bett et al .",
    "2007 , vera - ciro et al . 2011 ) .",
    "further the axis ratio varies with radius .",
    "indeed , there is no simple physical reason why the shape should be constant with radius .",
    "thus a radially variable axis ratio for an ellipsoidal mass distribution is not just of academic interest but of practical use for a study of dark matter halos , and in other astrophysical systems as well .",
    "to study the dynamics of a prolate halo , we need to first calculate its potential and other physical quantities .",
    "mathematically this reduces to the problem of inversion of poisson equation for a given density distribution .",
    "this is a rich and an old subject , which had attracted the attention of mighty mathematicians like maclaurin , lagrange , jacobi , gauss to name a few ( e.g. rohlfs 1977 ) , also see chandraskekhar ( 1969 ) for details . yet , interestingly , the calculation for a prolate case with varying eccentricity has to our knowledge not been studied in the literature so far .    motivated by this , in this paper we study prolate ellipsoidal mass distributions with an eccentricity that varies with radius .",
    "the ellipsoids are taken to be concentric and coaxial or coplanar .",
    "we show that the constancy of potential within a shell as in homoeoids is a good approximation even when the shell is bounded by dissimilar ellipsoids , for small variation in the eccentricity as seen in realistic systems .",
    "this is an important general result from this paper .",
    "we calculate the potential for a general density distribution by adding the shell - by - shell contributions from isodensity surfaces from shells internal and external to a point , and from this obtain the radial and planar force equations and frequencies .",
    "next , these results are applied to the specific case of pseudo - isothermal density distribution for the dark matter halo , and an exponential disc of finite thickness , to study the longevity of the galactic warp for a disc in a prolate halo .",
    "we show that the prolate halo does not result in a long - lived warp , contrary to the literature where a prolate halo ( ideta et al . 2000 ) or a halo with a radially variable shape ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) have been suggested to explain long - lived warps .",
    "the calculation of the potential and related physical quantities are given in section 2 . in section 3",
    "this is applied to toy mass models so as to study the properties of a prolate spheroidal system .",
    "section 4 we apply this to the milky way and study the effect of the prolate halo on the warp and show that the halo does not yield long - lived warps .",
    "section 5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the reader who is mainly interested in the application of a prolate halo to the study of warps , may wish to skip the technical material involving potential theory in sections 2 and 3 , and go directly to section 4 .",
    "the dark matter halo is usually modeled as a spherical or oblate distribution of constant ratio , for simplicity ( e.g. , sackett & sparke 1990 ) . in a rare case ,",
    "an oblate mass distribution with radially varying axis ratio has been studied ( ryden 1990 ) in the quadrupolar limit , and extended for the prolate case by buote & canizares ( 1996 ) in the same limit .",
    "the general case of a prolate spheroidal mass distribution , in particular with a varying axis ratio , has not been studied in the literature so far .",
    "the potential for a general triaxial case ( with constant axis ratios ) is stated in binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) without derivation , and has been derived in chandrasekhar ( 1969 ) , and by de zeeuw & pfenniger ( 1988 ) . from this one can derive the potential for a prolate spheroid of constant axis ratio , as for example was done by das & jog ( 1995 ) for modeling bars in a study of heating due bars .    in this paper",
    ", we give the analytical calculation of the potential and other relevant physical quantities of a body for which the isodensity surfaces are prolate in shape with radially varying eccentricity . in this way of formulation of the problem , the case of a constant axis ratio comes out naturally as a simple case of the general calculation , as shown later in this section .",
    "first the potential due to a prolate spheroidal surface is calculated , following the approach developed for an oblate spheroidal surface by binney @xmath0 tremaine ( 1987 ) . then by summing over the contribution by the various shells ,",
    "the net potential is obtained .      to calculate the potential of a prolate spheroidal surface ,",
    "it is appropriate to use the prolate spheroidal coordinate system @xmath1 .",
    "however , the galactic disc is usually represented in cylindrical coordinates .",

    "( 8) tends to zero at infinity like the gravitational potential of mass @xmath22 , as expected , here@xmath22 is the mass of the surface .",
    "thus we are led to consider , @xmath23    this potential is discontinuous on the spheroid @xmath24 .",
    "hence it is the gravitational potential of a shell of material on the surface @xmath24 .",
    "this shell has principal semi - major and semi - minor axes of lengths @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",

    "hence the potential inside a shell bounded by similar surfaces can be taken to be constant ( newton s theorem ) , or there is no force at an internal point due to such a shell .",
    "this is the standard homoeoidal theory of ellipsoids ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1969 ) .",
    "it is not clear a priori that the results from the homoeoidal potential theory are applicable for a shell bounded by dissimilar surfaces considered here .",
    "in fact , in this case , the surface density obtained by taking the projection ( eq . [ 21 ] ) differs from that obtained earlier by the gauss s theorem approach ( eq.[13 ] ) by a dimensionless scale factor @xmath52 , defined as :    @xmath53\\ ] ]    this scale factor denotes the deviation from the case of constant internal potential .",
    "we show in appendix a that the values of @xmath52 are small for the small variation in eccentricity with radius considered here .",

    "the last three cases , in particular the one with the prolate halo , show an almost constant pattern speed throughout the range of radii of interest where the warp is seen .",
    "this led ideta et al ( 2000 ) to the conclusion that a prolate halo results in a galactic warp that can be sustained for more than the hubble time .",
    "to summarise , they arrived at this wrong conclusion due to the use of an approximate expression for the potential for an infinitesimally thin disc as applied to a low radial range where it is not valid .",
    "the correct treatment for the disc in the present paper shows that the disc contribution to the pattern speed is dominant ( solid line , fig .",
    "6 , also see fig .",
    "4 ) , and that the prolate dark matter halo , indeed halo of any shape , has very little effect on the pattern speed of the galactic warp .",
    "the normalized differential force due to the heteroid shells considered is negligible ( @xmath185 , see appendix a ) , hence that too can not affect the above result .",
    "in retrospect , this is not surprising , since the previous work on the origin of warps by non - axisymmetric response showed that the radius of onset of warps in a galactic disc depends weakly on whether or not an oblate halo is included or on its shape , as shown for a disc with an exponential vertical distribution ( saha & jog 2006 ) or a general @xmath47 distribution ( pranav & jog 2010 ) .",
    "we caution that we have only considered a simple kinematical model of warp , as an application of the potential obtained for prolate ellipsoids of varying eccentricity .",
    "the latter was the main aim of this paper .",
    "a complete treatment of the dynamics and origin of warps would be much more complex and could involve a responsive and triaxial halo ( e.g. , binney , jiang & dutta 1998 , dubinski & chakrabarti 2009 ) and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we have given the analytical calculation for the potential of a prolate ellipsoidal mass distribution with radially varying eccentricity .",
    "this is obtained by summing up the shell - by - shell contributions of isodensity surfaces .",
    "we define a heteroid to be a shell that is bounded by two dissimilar surfaces .",
    "an important result from this paper is that the potential within a heteroid is shown to be approximately constant as long as the radial variation and the range of values of eccentricity spanned are small as in realistic systems .",
    "the normalized differential force across such a shell is non - zero but small and does not affect the dynamical stability of such figures on a hubble time .    the motivation for this work was to see if the progressively prolate halo for the galaxy ( as in banerjee & jog 2011 ) could help sustain long - term warps .",
    "we apply the above calculation to the case of galactic warp , and on using the correct treatment for the disc , find that the disc mainly determines the warp pattern speed .",
    "thus , the dark matter halo has only a marginal effect on the pattern speed , and it does not lead to long - lived warps .    the results for the potential and force components obtained here are general and could be applied for a more realistic treatment of other astrophysical systems such as prolate bars with a varying shape . we also give a similar exact calculation for the oblate case for the sake of completeness .",
    "this can be applied to oblate spheroidal systems with varying eccentricity .                                                            in this paper",
    "we treat spheroids of radially varying eccentricity . in analogy with a homoeoid which is a shell bounded by two similar spheroids ,",
    "we define a heteroid to be a shell bounded by two dissimilar spheroids ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "we show next that the results from the standard homoeoid potential theory , namely the constancy of potential inside a shell and no net force within it , are good approximations even for the case of a shell with dissimilar surfaces - when the radial variation in eccentricity is small as seen in realistic systems .",
    "this is an important general result and to our knowledge the heteroid case has not been studied systematically in the past .    _",
    "potential inside a shell within dissimilar spheroids : _ recall from section 2.2 that for the dissimilar prolate surfaces with the variation in eccentricity , the dimensionless scale factor @xmath52 ( see eq.[21 ] ) denotes the deviation from the case of constant internal potential : @xmath53 \\eqno(a1)\\ ] ] where @xmath186 denotes the dimensionless change in the eccentricity with radius .    in fig .",
    "a1 , we plot the values of this scale factor versus the major axis @xmath91 normalized w.r.t . the core radius , for decreasing @xmath38 ( as given by eq . [ 41 ] ) with @xmath187 for the prolate co - ordinate @xmath188= 0 and @xmath189 and similarly for increasing prolateness with @xmath38 increasing ( as given by eq .",
    "[ 41 ] ) with @xmath99 .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the scale factor values are small ( @xmath190 a few % ) .",
    "hence the deviation from the case of similar shells treated in homoeoidal theory is non - zero but small .",
    "thus , interestingly , we find that for the small variation in eccentricity with radius and for the range of @xmath38 values as considered in this paper- the assumption of a constant potential within a shell is a good approximation even for the case of a shell bounded by dissimilar surfaces",
    ".    _ force inside a shell within dissimilar spheroids _ : from the homoeoidal theorem we know that the force inside a shell bounded by similar spheroids is zero ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1969 , binney & tremaine 1987 ) . here we find out the force due to a shell bounded by two dissimilar spheroids ( a heteroid ) .",
    "the expression of the internal potential of homogenous spheroid is ( binney & tremaine 1987 , eq.2.128 ) : @xmath191 where @xmath192 and@xmath193 are defined for the prolate case as follows ( see binney & tremaine 1987 , tables 2 - 1 , 2 - 2 ) : @xmath194 @xmath195 \\eqno(a4)\\ ] ] @xmath196 \\eqno(a5)\\ ] ] hence the radial component of the gravitational field generated by a homogenous spheroid at an internal point ( r , z ) is : @xmath197 the vertical force component is : @xmath198    we can think of the force at an internal point of a heteroid shell as being obtained by the subtraction of force due to the outer spheroid and that due to the inner spheroid .",
    "thus , the differential radial force due to the shell is : @xmath199 where the superscripts @xmath200 and @xmath201 denote the outer and inner spheroids respectively , and where @xmath141 is the density of the shell .",
    "similarly the vertical force is :      first , check that the force inside of such a shell would be identically equal to zero if the surfaces are similar ( homoeoids ) .",
    "next , we can find out the total differential force at a point ( r , z ) due to outer dissimilar shells by adding the contributions of each shell .",
    "the magnitude of the differential force depends on the eccentricities of ellipsoids which surround the shell .",
    "the total differential force at a point is obtained for the density distribution ( eq.[40 ] ) and the eccentricities ( eq.[41 ] ) used in our work , and this is normalised with the force due to a homogenous spheroid which has the surface that is passing through the point ( r , z ) and has that value of constant density . for normalization",
    ", a constant density ellipsoid is assumed for simplicity .",
    "the increasing @xmath38 ( more prolate at larger radii ) corresponds to @xmath203 while decreasing @xmath38 ( less prolate at smaller radii ) has @xmath187 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "these correspond to a variation in the prolate axis ratio , @xmath38 = 1.5 to 1.9 , and 1.5 to 1.2 respectively ( section 3 ) .",
    "the increasing case covers the range of values of @xmath38 similar to the range deduced from flaring of hi data in the outer milky way ( banerjee & jog 2011 , also see section 4.2 ) .",
    "clearly , the differential force is very small ( with magnitudes @xmath204 1 % ) for the range of semi - minor axis values that we are interested in .",
    "as expected , the differential force magnitudes are highest at inner radii but still small @xmath205 .",
    "the typical value of @xmath89 , the core radius , is 5 kpc in our galaxy ( section 4 ) , thus the ratio @xmath91 = 1 - 8 corresponds to about 5 to 40 kpc .",
    "therefore , we can take the internal force due to the spheroids of varying eccentricity to be zero for our calculation .",
    "this further confirms that newton s theorem is a good assumption even for the case of dissimilar ellipsoids considered here .",
    "this is an important , general result and can be applied to other realistic cases .",
    "for example , this is also applicable for studies of dark matter halos in simulations which show an even smaller variation in the prolate or oblate axes ratio ( e.g. , jing & suto 2002 , vera - ciro et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "since the typical dynamical timescale in a homogenous spheroid with a surface at say 3 @xmath89 = 15 kpc is @xmath179 a few @xmath206 yrs , hence the differential force of @xmath207 of the force due to the inner spheroid is not likely to affect the stability of such a distribution over 100 times the dynamical timescales or over a hubble time .      in this appendix , we give the oblate case with varying eccentricity for the sake of completeness , with an approach similar to that developed in this paper for the prolate case",
    ". this problem has been looked at earlier by ryden ( 1990 ) , who however used the method of multipoles limiting to the quadrupole approximations .",
    "thus ryden s results are approximate and in particular not rigorous for inner regions , as we check by comparing with the exact calculations below .",
    "hence we give the exact calculation below .",
    "this could be of use not just for dark matter halo but also for other systems of varying eccentricity such as bulges .",
    "the method of derivation of physical quantities for the case of oblate spheroidal mass distribution is similar to the method that is described for the prolate spheroidal mass distributions .",
    "so the resulting equations of potential , forces , vertical and horizontal frequencies are given here without detailed derivations .",
    "the density profile , axis ratio and @xmath186 are used as the functions of semi - major axis @xmath36 .",
    "( remember that in the case of prolate distribution , @xmath36 is the semi - minor axis ) . here",
    "the axis ratio is always less than @xmath208 .",
    "the potential of the oblate spheroidal shell on the surface @xmath24 in oblate spheroidal coordinate system is given in binney @xmath0 tremaine ( 1987 ) , to be : @xmath209 where @xmath8 is defined in cylindrical coordinates as : @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a constant , @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath22 is the mass on the surface @xmath24 .",
