    "the profile of a light curve in an astronomical object includes a wide range of information , i.e. , the spatial distribution and dynamical motion of gas , or its radiative processes , etc .",
    "the analysis of the light curve has been therefore known as an important tool from the old days .",
    "especifically , in the case of the eclipsing binary system , which has a compact star , it is useful to suppose the brightness distribution of the accretion disk around the compact star .",
    "this method can also be applied to black hole candidates . generally , it is difficult to discern light from the companion star and light from the accretion disk , but if the object has an eclipse , it may be possible for two ingredients to separate .",
    "moreover , black hole candidates show the ( partially ) eclipsing property , and we could close in on the feature of the accreting gas , or the black hole mass , or spin , etc ( fukue 1987 ; watarai et al . 2005 ; takahashi & watarai 2007 ) .    for the last decade , a large number of luminous black hole candidates ( bhcs ) have been found in nearby galaxies .",
    "they are called `` ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) '' , but their origin is still unknown ( makishima et al . 2000 ;",
    "roberts et al .",
    "x - ray data analysis is the mainstream study of the ulxs , but other band data will be useful for evaluating other binary parameters .",
    "it is no wonder that eclipsing binaries are detected among the bhcs .",
    "in fact , several eclipsing black hole binaries have been discovered ( orosz et al .",
    "2007 in m33 ; ghosh et al . 2006 in ngc4214 ) .    to examine the observational properties of such luminous eclipsing binaries",
    ", light - curve fitting will be a powerful tool .",
    "the conventional study of a light curve in a binary system applies a geometrically thin disk , a so - called standard accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "this model may have applicability to the high / soft state in black hole candidates , but it may not extend to the low / hard state , very high state , or super - critical state , which is a more luminous state than the high soft state .",
    "luminous black hole candidates that exceed to the eddington luminosity seem to accrete a large amount of gas via a companion star , and the disk becomes geometrically thick .",
    "this type of accretion flow is called a `` slim disk '' ( abramowicz et al . 1988 ; watarai et al .",
    "the geometrical thickness of this disk can play an important role in covering a companion star , depending on an angle , and contribute to changing the shape of the light curve .",
    "it is necessary to include it in a calculation of bright binary system properly .",
    "fukue et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) performed light curve analysis in ss433 using geometrically thick torus model by madau ( 1988 ) , but it is known that the disk model is thermally unstable .",
    "hirai & fukue ( 2001 ) compared the optical light curve in ss433 with ( thermally stable ) supercritical accretion disks , but they adopted the self - similar solutions even at the disk outer region .",
    "we thus adopted a thermally stable , more realistic ( appropriate ) treatment of the disk model , and compared the model with observations of super - critical accreting objects such as ss433 and ultraluminous x - ray sources .",
    "in addition , in the previous studies the mass outflow from a supercritical disk was not included , but a naked supercritical disk was considered . hence , in the present study we consider the supercritical accretion disk with an optically thick outflow from the center .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the assumptions of our model . in section 3 ,",
    "we briefly show the light curve calculation method .",
    "calculation results are presented in section 4 .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we calculate the light curve when the binary star system that fills roche - lobe is assumed , and a supercritical accretion has occured in the compact star .",
    "ideas of supercritical accretion have been proposed by many authors in early 1970 s ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1978 ; jaroczynski et al . 1980 ;",
    "paczyski & wiita 1980 ) .",
    "whether accretion that exceeds the eddington luminosity is possible or not has been doubted for many years . the solution for supercritical accretion had already been obtained in one dimension ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) . due to the development of the computer ,",
    "supercritical accretion is actually known to be reproduced by numerical simulations ( okuda 2002 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "2005 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2008 ) .",
    "it thus becomes impossible for us to deny supercritical accretion any longer .",
    "in the next subsections , we briefly introduce our model and assumptions .",
    "the photon trapping radius characterizes supercritical accretion at the radius where advective energy transport becomes important ( begelman & meier 1982 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "this radius accords with the radius that the gravity of the disk balances with the radiation pressure , and it has been suggested that an outflow may originate inside it ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; lipunova 1999 ; fukue 2004 ; heinzeller & duschl 2007 ) . however , the outflow blows a very tiny area compared with the size of the whole disk .",
    "it actually will not have an influence on computing optical flux .",
    "recently takeuchi et al . (",
    "2009 ) analyzed 2d rhd simulation results by ohsuga et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and rebuilt a one dimension model , but the effective temperature distribution of the one dimension model hardly changes .",
    "therefore , we can use an one - dimension model safely without any outflow effect .      for radiation - pressure",
    "dominated regime , watarai ( 2006 ) constructed analytical formulae that can be applied for a wide range of accretion rates , and it has been shown that these solutions are a good approximation of the numerical solutions . according to watarai ( 2006 ) , the scale height of the disk is given by @xmath8 this solution is characterized by the ratio of the advective cooling rate to the viscous heating rate , i.e. , @xmath9 , which can be represented by an analytical form dependent on the radius and the mass accretion rate , @xmath10 .",
    "the radius @xmath11 is normalized by the schwarzschild radius , and the @xmath12 represents the mass accretion rate in eddington units ( @xmath13 ) . the explicit form of @xmath10 is given by @xmath14\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a constant of order unity ( e.g. , @xmath16 for a polytropic index @xmath17 ) .",
    "the function @xmath10 is close to unity for an advection dominated regime , and it is close to zero for a radiative cooling dominated regime ( see watarai 2006 for more details ) .",
    "the effective temperature distribution is given by @xmath18    the boundary radius between the radiation - pressure dominated regime and the gas - pressure dominated regime is located at @xmath19 the same equations are posed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "we note that analytic solutions shown here are useful for radiation - pressure dominated regime .      in the gas - pressure dominated regime ,",
    "if electron scattering dominates the opacity , the scale height of the disk and the effective temperature distribution are @xmath20 @xmath21 with the same formula by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .    the transition radius where @xmath22 is @xmath23 and thus it is a simple function of the mass accretion rate .",
    "the outer region of the disk is dominated by free - free opacity , and the scale height is given by @xmath24 with the effective radial dependence of the temperature as in equation ( [ eq : teff ] ) .",
    "we ignore the irradiation by the disk itself or the photosphere of the outflow , because the irradiation dominated regime appears at the outer region of the disk , and the temperature and geometrical effects do not contribute to the optical light curves ( less than 10 % ) . to avoid confusion of the model , we decided to handle an easier model .",
    "shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) proposed the massive ( supercritical ) outflow , which is formed by the strong radiation from the disk .",
    "the size of the photosphere surface made by the outflow becomes large and has an influence on the form of the light curve .",
    "thus , we should include the effect of the outflow in our model .",
    "we do not include the collimated , relativistic jet component in this paper .",
    "here we introduce a simple wind model by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , which assumes a spherical symmetry and uniform outflow velocity .",
    "the density of the wind , @xmath25 , is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass outflow rate , @xmath28 is the velocity of the gas , @xmath29 is the lorentz factor : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the distance from the black hole .",
    "the mass outflow rate should be determined by the physics of the interaction between the disk and outflow , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the efficiency of the outflow gas from accreting gas . in our present study",
    ", we assume @xmath35 for simplicity .",
    "that is , our model simply assumes that all accreting matter changes to the outflow at the disk inner edge ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the location of the boundary layer between the outflow and the disk may have a strong impact on the emerging x - ray spectrum , but it is not expected to have an enormous influence on the optical band , since the optical emitting region of the photosphere is far away from the disk inner edge .",
    "to calculate the @xmath0-band flux in a binary system , we adopt the `` ray - tracing method '' .",
    "we suppose that the binary star fills the roche lobe and transports its mass to the compact star .",
    "the shape of the companion star reflects the shape of the potential .",
    "the photon propagates from an emitting point on the surface of the disk or that of the photosphere of the wind to the distant observer . according to fermat s principle , however ,",
    "the light rays are traced from the observer s display coordinate @xmath37 .",
    "after the ray arrives at the surface of the disk / wind , we evaluate the geometrical thickness and effective temperature of the disk / wind model presented in the previous section .",
    "the observed flux is integrated in each optical bands ( @xmath0 , @xmath32 , @xmath38 ) , assuming the blackbody radiation at the surface of the disk , star , and photosphere of the outflow .",
    "the spatial resolution of the calculation is about @xmath39 of the binary distance , which equals to @xmath40 - @xmath41 .",
    "this resolution is sufficient to resolve optical flux from the binary system .",
    "thus , mesh size of this calculation is at least much smaller than 10 % of this radius .",
    "location of the wind photosphere is estimated from the point where the optical depth measured from a distant observer equals to unity , that is , @xmath42 where the @xmath43 is location of the last scattering surface of the photon in the disk coordinates , @xmath29 is the lorentz factor , @xmath44 is the opacity for electron scattering , @xmath45 is the velocity of the wind normalized by the speed of light @xmath5 , and the @xmath46 is the inclination angle .",
    "abramowicz et al . ( 1991 ) obtained an analytic solution of a moving plasma , and the shape of the photosphere in their model does not have spherical symmetry .",
    "we use their formulae in this paper .    in some cases , analytic formulae derived by king ( 2003 ) are useful to estimate the size of the photosphere .",
    "it is given by @xmath47 where @xmath43 is the radius of the photosphere , @xmath44 is the opacity for electron scattering , and @xmath48 is the eccentricity of the photosphere .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is @xmath49 , which is fixed at unity throughout this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that the mass outflow rate , @xmath27 , is equal to the mass accretion rate at the central region .",
    "the mass outflow rate in our model gives the maximum rate .",
    "typical size of the photosphere is given by @xmath50 as we show later , if the size of the photosphere is much smaller than the disk size , the photosphere does not influence the shape of the eclipsing light curves .",
    "we evaluate the maximum temperature of the photosphere by using the following procedure .",
    "first , we estimate the size of the photosphere of the outflow . assuming that photons ejected from the disk surface inside the photosphere is conserved until escaping photons from the surface of the photosphere , i.e. , all photons are generated inside the disk , not be generated in the wind .",
    "the temperature of the wind photosphere @xmath51 then is given by @xmath52 here the luminosity of the disk , @xmath53 , is given by @xmath54    to determine the location of the disk surface or the photosphere of the outflow , we integrated the optical depth from an observer at infinity to the surface of @xmath55 along the line of sight .",
    "after the light rays arrived at the surface , we measured the temperature using equation ( [ eq : tw ] ) and the geometrical thickness of the disk from the underlying disk / wind models .",
    "let us see the results when only a naked supercritical disk is considered . in figure 1 , we show the @xmath0-band ( @xmath56 hz  @xmath57 hz ) flux images at different binary phases .",
    "the mass accretion rates is @xmath58 , the inclination angle is @xmath59 , mass ratio is @xmath60 , temperature of the companion star is @xmath61 k , and velocity of the wind is @xmath62 , respectively . as can be seen in figure 1 ,",
    "the geometrical thickness of the disk is thin compared with the size of the disk .",
    "it is understood that the thickness of the disk does not affect the light curve for @xmath58 .",
    "the scale height of the disk weakly depends on the @xmath12 as can be seen equations ( [ eq : ha ] ) , ( [ eq : hb ] ) , ( [ eq : hc ] ) .    figure [ fig : nowind - i - lc ] is the time - variation of @xmath0-band flux for various inclination angles .",
    "the mass accretion rate is set to be @xmath58 .",
    "when the inclination angle increases , the flux drops at phase 0.5 .",
    "this is because the disk hides emission from a secondary star .",
    "optical emission from the secondary star is much larger than that from the disk for @xmath58 .    as mass accretion rate increases",
    ", the disk becomes as luminous as the companion star ( see figure [ fig : nowind - md - lc ] ) .",
    "some previous studies applied a thick disk model to the optical light curve analysis in ss433 ( sanbuichi & fukue 1993 ; fukue et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; hirai & fukue 2001 ) . however , their model is called `` thick torus model '' ( abramowicz et al . 1978 ; madau et al .",
    "1988 ) , and it is thermally / secularly unstable ( kato et al . 1998 ) .",
    "apart from the structure of the inner most region of the disk , our analytic disk model ( i.e. , slim disk model ) is applicable to the supercritically accreting regime ( watarai 2006 ) .",
    "the model can produce more plausible temperature and scale height .",
    "hence , our model for a bright object is more realistic than that of past researche .",

    "<S> we examine optical @xmath0-band light curves in luminous eclipsing black hole x - ray binaries , using a supercritical accretion / outflow model that is more realistic than the formerly used ones . in order to compute the theoretical light curve in the binary system , </S>",
    "<S> we did not only apply the global analytic solution of the disk , but also include the effect of the optically thick outflow . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the depth of eclipse of the companion star by the disk changes dramatically when including the effect of the outflow . due to the effect of outflow </S>",
    "<S> , we could reproduce the optical light curve for typical binary parameters in ss433 . our model with an outflow velocity </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 could fit whole shape of the averaged @xmath0-band light curve in ss433 , but we found a possible parameter range consistent with observations , such as @xmath2 500010000 @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 being the eddington luminosity and @xmath5 being the speed of light ) and @xmath6=10000k14000 k for the accretion rate and donor star temperature , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we briefly discuss observational implications for ultraluminous x - ray sources . </S>"
