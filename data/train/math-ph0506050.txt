    "one of motivations for modelling the macromolecular structure is the careful observation of the protein data banks . in the present stage of macromolecular evolution",

    "the generalization of the formulae derived in section 1 to non - consecutive points @xcite along a right circular helix is done by taking into consideration the possibility of skipping points systematically to define subsequences .",
