    "the two - component characteristic of the high - intensity state spectra , namely a thermal component below @xmath2200 kev and a non - thermal component above 200 kev , shown in these three sources is different than the pure simple power - law spectrum shown in gro  @xmath61 ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ; case et al .",
    "2004 ) , and a broken power law shown in grs  1915 + 105 ( case et al .",
    "2004 ) , two other black - hole systems that are generally considered to be microquasars .",
    "these results confirm previous observations ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) that there are at least two classes of gamma - ray emitting bh candidates in our galaxy .",
    "the evidence for a persistent power - law component in both the high and low - intensity spectra of gro  j@xmath1 strongly suggest the presence of non - thermal processes in the system in both the high and low - intensity situations .",
    "the strong similarity of the gamma - ray characteristics shown in gro  j@xmath1 and cygnus x-1 and gro  j0422 + 32 raises the following key questions that need to be addressed .",
    "( 1 ) what is the basic system configuration for interpreting the gamma - ray spectra ? and ( 2 ) what are the physical processes responsible for the changes of the spectral shapes shown between the high and low - intensity spectra ?    over the past several years , a number of theories have been advanced in explaining the thermal and non - thermal emission observed in the high - intensity state spectra .",
    "chakrabarti @xmath14 titarchuk ( 1995 ) and turolla et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have proposed that relativistic electrons with energies up to 1 mev may be associated with free infall of matter onto the black hole in the converging flow region near the event horizon .",
    "the observed power - law spectral tail may possibly be produced by compton up - scattering of photons produced in the system off these in - falling electrons .",
    "meier ( 2001 ) suggested that non - thermal gamma - ray emission may be associated with jets , which he claimed is a natural consequence of accretion flows onto rotating black holes .",
    "more recently , meier s ( 2004 ) model of magnetically - dominated accretion flows ( mdaf ) further develops the idea and integrates accretion and jet production as an extension of the adaf ( esin et al .",
    "1998 ) and shakura @xmath14 sunyaev ( 1976 ) disk models .",
    "there were also suggestions for a hybrid thermal / non - thermal comptonization model ( coppi 1998 ; gierlinski et al.1999 ) . in this model ,",
    "the electron distribution consisted of two components , a maxwellian component with a temperature , @xmath62 , plus a non - thermal power - law component .",
    "the acceleration of non - thermal electrons is independently taking place but is coupled to the background thermal plasma by compton scattering and coulomb collision processes .",
    "while such a model aimed to explain the two - component high - intensity gamma - ray spectra observed in bh binary systems such as gro  j@xmath1 , gro  j0422 + 32 and cygnus x-1 , no attempts have been made to explain how the spectrum evolved into a power law in the low - intensity scenario .",
    "ling @xmath14 wheaton ( 2003a ) suggested a possible system scenario for explaining both the high and low - intensity spectra .",
    "it is based on the adaf model of esin et al ( 1998 ) along with the source geometry envisioned by poutanen @xmath14 coppi ( 1998 ) and others . because the non - thermal power law was fully visible in the 35 kev to 1 mev low - intensity spectrum , while only partially visible above 200 kev , and fully hidden behind the comptonized spectrum below 200 kev in the high - intensity spectrum , they proposed a system , for the high - intensity scenario , that consists of a hot inner corona , a cooler outer thin disk , and a separate region that produces the power - law @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "we hereby refer to the latter the  non thermal emission region ( nter ) \" .",
    "nter may include a jet ( see ling @xmath14 wheaton 2003a figure 6 ; ling @xmath14 wheaton 2004 ) and possibly also the converging flow region discussed above .",
    "under such condition , the transition radius of the disk is @xmath2100 schwarzschild radii from the black hole .",
    "electrons in the hot corona up - scattered the low - energy photons produced both inside the corona as well as from the outer disk to form the comptonized component that dominates the spectrum in the 35 - 200 kev range .",
    "these same electrons also down - scattered the high energy photons ( @xmath5810 mev ) produced in nter resulting in forming a softer power - law component observed in the 200 kev to 1 mev range . under the low - intensity scenario that could be triggered by a significant increase in the accretion rate ,",
    "a large quantity of soft photon was produced in the disk that cooled and quenched the hot corona and moved the transition radius inward to a distance very close to the horizon . under this condition ,",
    "the comptonized component below 200 kev disappeared and the entire 35 - 1000 kev spectrum is dominated by the unperturbed emission produced by nter .    in summary , similar gamma - ray spectral characteristics and evolution between high and low - intensity transitions have now been observed in three galactic binary bh systems gro  j@xmath1 , gro  j0422 + 32 and cygnus x-1 .",
    "these results present new challenges and constraints to future theoretical work in this field .",
    "we hope this work will stimulate a renewed interest to modelers to effectively address the questions posed by the new results presented in this paper .",
    "we wish to thank gerald fishman and his batse team for their support of the batse earth occultation investigation effort at jpl throughout the years , dave meier , michael cherry and gary case for their useful comments on this manuscript , and undergraduate students robert kern , zachary medin , and juan estrella for processing the data .",

    "<S> we report results of an in - depth study of the long - term soft @xmath0-ray ( 30 kev  1.7 mev ) flux and spectral variability of the transient source gro  j@xmath1 that was first discovered by batse and sigma in the fall of 1993 . </S>",
    "<S> our results were obtained from the jpl batse - ebop database covering a 1000-day period between 13 january 1993 and 10 october 1995 . during this period , </S>",
    "<S> the source underwent a major outburst in the fall of 1993 when the 35 - 100 kev flux rose from a quiescent state of less than 16 mcrab before 17 september 1993 to a level of 1.5 crab on 3 october . </S>",
    "<S> the source remained in this high - intensity state over the next @xmath270 days during which the @xmath3 kev flux decreased monotonically by @xmath233@xmath4 to @xmath21 crab level on 12 december , then decreased sharply to the pre - transition quiescent level of @xmath244 mcrab on 21 december where it remained until 5 september 1994 . during a 400-day period between 5 september 1994 and 10 october 1995 </S>",
    "<S> , the source again underwent a series of five transitions when the 35 - 100 kev flux increased to low - intensity levels of @xmath2200 - 400 mcrab , a factor of @xmath5 times lower than that observed in 1993 . </S>",
    "<S> the low and high - intensity states were characterized by two different spectral shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the low - state spectra were described by a power law with spectral index of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the high - state spectra on the other hand have two components : a thermal comptonized shape below @xmath2200 kev with electron temperature @xmath6 of @xmath237 kev and optical depth @xmath7 @xmath22.8 , and a soft power - law tail with photon index of @xmath23.4 above 200 kev that extends to @xmath2500 kev . the softer high - intensity spectrum and the harder low - intensity spectrum intercept at @xmath2400 kev . </S>",
    "<S> the non - thermal power - law gamma - ray component in both the high and low - intensity spectra suggests that the persistent non - thermal emission source is coupled to the hot and variable thermal emission source in the system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the correlation of the spectral characteristics with the high and low - intensity state resembles that seen in two other gamma - ray emitting black - hole candidates gro  j0422 + 32 and cygnus x-1 , suggesting that perhaps similar system configurations and processes are occurring in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> possible scenarios for interpreting these behaviors are discussed . </S>"
