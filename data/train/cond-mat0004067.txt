    "a characteristic feature of the high-@xmath13 superconductors ( hts ) is the @xmath14 temperature dependence of the normal state hall angle @xmath15 which has been explained by anderson within the framework of the luttinger liquid theory @xcite .",
    "recently performed thermal hall conductivity measurements on yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath16 ( y123 ) single crystals at @xmath17 suggest that such a behavior would extend down to @xmath18k @xcite .",
    "obviously the @xmath14 dependence can not continue to arbitrarily low temperatures since it would imply an infinite scattering time or mean free path for the quasiparticles . nevertheless , it is unclear from literature which is the temperature dependence of the hall angle below @xmath13 and at which temperature the monotonic temperature dependence breaks down .",
    "apart from a possible saturation of @xmath19 ( an effective mean free path of quasiparticles ) at low enough temperatures , there are at least two more reasons to expect a deviation from a monotonous temperature dependence at low temperatures .",
    "( 1 ) theory predicts a maximum in @xmath20 at low enough temperatures due to a crossover from holon non - drag regime to localization @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) electrical transport measurements performed on underdoped yba@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath23 @xcite and zn - doped yba@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath24 @xcite crystals as well as in bi@xmath21sr@xmath21ca@xmath25cu@xmath26o@xmath27 thin films @xcitesuggest that the temperature dependence of the ( electrical ) hall angle @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the hall scattering time and @xmath30 the effective mass of the quasiparticles responsible for the hall signal ) has a maximum at or near the temperature at which the pseudogap opens .",
    "experimental evidence accumulated over the last years suggests also that the opening of a pseudogap can take place below the superconducting transition temperature affecting the electronic properties of hts @xcite , although its nature and its relationship to superconductivity are not yet well understood .",
    "whereas the electrical hall angle can hardly be measured at @xmath31 , the thermal transport is suitable for the low temperature studies .    below the superconducting critical temperature @xmath13 and decreasing temperature",
    ", the in - plane longitudinal thermal conductivity @xmath32 in hts increases and shows a maximum between @xmath33 .",
    "this behavior is attributed nowadays mainly to the increase of the electronic contribution @xmath34 due to the increase in the quasiparticle - quasiparticle relaxation time @xmath35 .",
    "it appears that the increase in @xmath35 decreasing @xmath36 overwhelms the decrease of the density of quasiparticles due to their condensation in the superconducting state .",
    "pioneer work on the thermal conductivity of yba@xmath21cu@xmath22o@xmath37 ( y123 ) crystals @xcite as well as thermal hall effect measurements @xcite provide strong evidence for this interpretation .",
    "regarding the difference between the hall @xmath38 and diagonal @xmath39 relaxation times we note that whereas @xmath35 shows a monotonic enhancement decreasing @xmath36 below @xmath13 , @xmath40 appears to be unaffected by the superconducting transition @xcite .    the difficulty to describe the behavior of the thermal conductivity and to obtain from the experimental data the temperature and field dependence of the hall angle resides mainly in the method to separate the electronic contribution @xmath41 from the measured total thermal conductivity .",
    "this is due to the relatively large phonon contribution to the thermal transport in hts .",
    "basically two methods for this separation have been treated in the literature .",
    "one method is based on a phenomenological description of the field dependence of @xmath42 , introduced first by vinen et al .",
    "@xcite and used in refs .",
    "@xcite to estimate @xmath34 .",
    "the other , apparently more elegant method presented by zeini et al .",
    "@xcite , is based on simultaneous measurements of the longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity and the assumption of a field independent hall relaxation time .",
    "we note that the experimental error of the published data of the thermal hall angle leaves its true temperature and field dependence not well defined below @xmath13 . in this work",
    "we obtain the temperature dependence of @xmath5 down to @xmath43  k using high - resolution experimental data of @xmath32 and @xmath44 and the two recently proposed separation methods .",
    "we will show that the ratio @xmath45 follows a @xmath46 dependence that agrees with the temperature dependence of the scattering rate obtained from longitudinal thermal conductivity measurements .",
    "for the measurements we have used a twinned , nearly optimally doped yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal with dimensions ( length @xmath47 width @xmath47 thickness )  @xmath48mm@xmath49 and @xmath50k .",
    "the use of a twinned crystal , with twinning planes parallel and perpendicular to the heat current , allows us to apply both separation methods described below , as well as to rule out the influence of orthorhombicity on the heat transport properties .",
    "the temperature and field dependence of @xmath32 for this crystal have been recently measured below and above @xmath13 with a relative accuracy of @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the transverse thermal conductivity has been determined using the relation @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the applied thermal gradient in @xmath54 direction and @xmath55 is perpendicular to it when a magnetic field is applied in the @xmath56 or @xmath57 direction ( parallel to the @xmath10-axis of the crystal ) .",
    "because of twinning we have assumed that @xmath58 .",
    "the temperature gradients were measured with a previously field- and temperature - calibrated type e thermocouples @xcite .",
    "their voltages were measured with a dc picovoltmeter which allowed a resolution of @xmath59k at 100  k ( @xmath60k at 10  k ) .",
    "the short time ( 2 h ) temperature stability of the sample holder was @xmath61k , for more details see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in all the temperature range ( 10  k  @xmath62k )",
    "we have applied relatively small temperature gradients along the sample , typically @xmath63mk , in order to diminish smearing effects in the @xmath36-dependence of the measured properties .",
    "@xmath64 was determined from the difference @xmath65/2 $ ] to eliminate offset contributions .",
    "the thermal hall effect was measured as a function of temperature at constant @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the field - cooled state of the sample in order to rule out pinning effects @xcite .",
    "the influence of the pinning of vortices to the hall effect in the mixed state of superconductors should be considered seriously and carefully minimized , specially at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "we have checked the results measuring also the field dependence of @xmath44 at constant selected temperatures .",
    "we have obtained very good agreement between both methods .",
    "figure [ dataset ] shows the longitudinal @xmath32 and transverse @xmath44 thermal conductivity as a function of temperature at different constant applied fields .",
    "the overall @xmath68dependence as well as the absolute value of those properties agree well with published results @xcite . from these data",
    "we may obtain @xmath40 if the electronic contribution @xmath34 is known since according to the usual definition @xmath69 as in ref .",
    "@xcite our data also show that , in good approximation , @xmath70 in the whole measured temperature range .",
    "this fact was used by zeini et al .",
    "@xcite to estimate the hall relaxation time assuming that @xmath44 and @xmath41 have a similar field dependence , neglecting the field dependence in @xmath40 or in the rest contribution to the thermal conductivity .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite for a pair of values of field @xmath71 with @xmath72 we can write @xmath73 taking pairs of points at low fields we can also calculate the initial hall slope @xmath74 . this quantity is depicted in fig .",
    "we note that @xmath74 increases two orders of magnitude below @xmath13 reaching a maximum at 40  k.    in fig .",
    "[ figtan_s](a ) we show @xmath75 obtained using ( [ tanzeini ] ) for two pairs of fields and also from a linear regression considering the data at all fields .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ figtan_s](a ) indicate that @xmath40 clearly deviates from a @xmath14 dependence and shows a maximum at @xmath9k .    the results in fig .",
    "[ figtan_s](a ) also indicate that @xmath75 depends slightly on the pairs of fields used to compute it and decreases the larger the field of the chosen pair .",
    "it appears that the values obtained from the linear regression would provide @xmath75 at @xmath76 .",
    "the zeini et al .",
    "approach is based on the assumption of a field independent @xmath40 or , in other words , a strictly linear field dependence for @xmath15 .",
    "deviation from this assumption can be proved using the second separation method @xcite to obtain @xmath41 from the experimental data .",
    "therefore , we use the second separation method in order to show that the temperature dependence of @xmath15 at low enough fields is independent of the assumption of a field independent @xmath40 .    as it was shown recently @xcite , in agreement with ref .  3",
    ", the field dependence of @xmath32 ( for @xmath77-axis ) at all temperatures below @xmath13 can be very well fitted assuming @xmath78 where @xmath79 is proportional to the zero - field electronic mean - free - path ( or the longitudinal relaxation time ) of the quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "fitting the field dependence of @xmath80 at different constant temperatures we can separate the electronic contribution and calculate @xmath75 as a function of temperature at different applied fields .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",

    "it appears that the results obtained using the zeini et al .",
    "approach @xcite are similar to those obtained with the krishana et al.@xcite for @xmath76 .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath84 is given in good approximation by the function @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a temperature dependent constant analogous to @xmath87 , see eq .",
    "( [ kapa ] ) . because @xmath88 and , in principle , @xmath89 , the field dependence of @xmath40 can be neglected in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "it seems therefore reasonable that in good approximation both approaches provide similar results for the ratio @xmath75 at @xmath76 .",
    "a rough relationship between @xmath75 and the effective mean free path of quasiparticles can be obtained if we assume that @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are the fermi velocity and wave vector , and @xmath93 the effective mass of quasiparticles . using @xmath94m@xmath95 we calculate the effective mean free path shown in the right axis scale of fig .",

    "we note further that the measured temperature dependence of @xmath6 shows a striking similarity with that measured for the @xmath10-axis microwave conductivity obtained at 22 ghz in a y123 crystal with similar @xmath13 @xcite , see fig .",

    "[ figtan_s ] .",
    "it is clear that to demonstrate the possible influence of the sample purity on the mean free path the thermal hall angle should be obtained at the low - field limit .",
    "we note also that the temperature of the minimum in @xmath101 can be shifted from @xmath10220  k to @xmath10240  k depending on the crystal @xcite .",

    "@xcite further show that the observed temperature dependence of the @xmath105axis conductivity in the intermediate temperature range should be an universal result independent of the scattering rate of quasiparticles . since @xmath6 is directly proportional to the scattering rate of the quasiparticles responsible for the hall signal and assuming that the result of ref .",

    "@xcite obtained a scattering rate that follows roughly a @xmath46 dependence in agreement with our result . on the other hand , since quasiparticle - quasiparticle scattering is the dominant temperature dependent scattering mechanism in our sample , we expect a scattering rate proportional to the density of quasiparticles . in the simple two - fluid model and for an isotropic order parameter",
    "we expect a density of quasiparticles proportional to @xmath46.@xcite",
    "in this section we restrict ourselves to discuss the nonmonotonic behavior obtained for the hall angle and its scaling properties .",
    "note first that a simple background scattering contribution to the effective quasiparticle mean free path should saturate @xmath109 at low enough temperatures .",
    "however , that @xmath75 shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence is a non - trivial result not yet clearly reported in the literature .",
    "the reason for this temperature dependence is not known at present . whatever its origin , the results indicate that some additional scattering , change in the quasiparticle density and/or a change in the effective mass takes place below @xmath81k in our sample . it would be interesting to see whether our results follow the scaling relations for transport properties of d - wave superconductors proposed in the last few years and whether this additional scattering / quasiparticle density or effective mass change has some effect or not .",
    "volovik and kopnin @xcite showed that in unconventional superconductors and because of the presence of low energy excitations associated with the gap nodes , at low temperatures and low fields @xmath110 the thermodynamic and transport properties are dominated by the influence of the doppler shift on the excitation spectrum of the quasiparticles due to the supercurrents flowing around the vortex cores .",
    "simon and lee @xcite predicted a scaling function with only one dimensionless parameter at temperatures below @xmath111k such that for the heat capacity @xmath112 and the hall component of the thermal conductivity @xmath113 with @xmath114 .",

    "hirschfeld et al .",
    "@xcite showed that when one treats transport quantities , an exact one - parameter scaling is not necessarily obtained .",

    ", we think that our results for the electronic part of the longitudinal and the hall component of the thermal conductivity on a y123 crystal do show a convincing scaling in a restricted temperature range only .",
    "while the experimental points between 30 k and 18 k collapse roughly onto a common curve , the ones below and above this range spread out .",
    "this result partially contradicts the experimental results shown in ref .",
    "@xcite since in that work no data were taken below 20 k. on the other hand the picture of an approximate scaling proposed first by kbert and hirschfeld @xcite and later by won and maki @xcite appears to be consistent with our experimental data implying that an additional scattering / quasiparticle density or effective mass change should be taken into account for the calculation of transport properties on these systems .",
    "the observed upturn in the @xmath10-axis conductivity at @xmath81k , see fig.[fig_tau ] , is not yet understood.@xcite because the c - axis conductivity decreases with temperature at @xmath132 it seems reasonable to conclude that the accompanied anomaly in @xmath20 is not related to the crossover from holon non - drag to a localization regime @xcite .",
    "experimental results indicate that below @xmath13 the @xmath10-axis conductivity shows a clearly different behavior as the @xmath133-plane conductivity , an experimental fact used as evidence for incoherent transport between cuo@xmath21 planes @xcite . a possible crossover to coherent transport at @xmath99 is , however , not yet clarified.@xcite ioffe and millis @xcite pointed out that the @xmath105axis conductivity involves mainly the scattering mechanism of electrons within a cuo@xmath21 plane . from this point of view",
    "appears reasonable to search for a common origin of the anomaly at @xmath99 observed in the @xmath105axis conductivity and the hall signal .",
    "however , this appears to be in contradiction to the different behavior of the electrical transport properties cited above .",
    "this apparently contradictory behavior may be related to the influence of the interlayer hopping integral on the @xmath105axis transport properties . according to xiang and hardy @xcite the anisotropy of this hopping integral affects in such a way the @xmath105axis conductivity that it does not depend on the quasiparticle scattering rate and an universal @xmath103 dependence below @xmath13",
    "is obtained in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "electrical hall angle measurements in different hts @xcite show a clear minimum in @xmath6 above @xmath13 which has been identified as the opening of the pseudogap .",
    "therefore , we may speculate that this opening occurs at @xmath99 where @xmath6 shows a clear minimum , see fig .",
    "[ fig_tau ] .",
    "we note that the opening of a pseudogap _ below _",

    "does the opening of a pseudogap influence the scattering rate @xmath136 or the effective mass @xmath30 ?",
    "since in a simple picture one expects the decrease of the scattering rate when the pseudogap opens , it has been suggested that the pseudogap affects @xmath6 through a change in the effective mass which may be related to a modification in the fermi surface topology.@xcite the correlation between hall angle and c - axis conductivity shown in the present work would suggest that the pseudogap influences the c - axis conductivity as well . if the scattering rate independence of the @xmath105axis conductivity @xcite would remain valid at and below @xmath99 , the correlation implies that the a similar mechanism that changes the effective mass at @xmath99 would be responsible for the upturn in the @xmath10-axis conductivity .",
    "we note , however , that experimental results in bi@xmath21sr@xmath21cacu@xmath21o@xmath137 hts indicate that the opening of the pseudogap reduces the @xmath105axis conductivity in the normal state.@xcite future experiments should clarify if this behavior is also observed in y123 hts and below @xmath13 .",
    "in summary , we have measured the longitudinal and transverse thermal conductivity of a twinned and nearly optimally doped y123 crystal as a function of temperature at different applied fields .",
    "we have used two different approaches to derive the temperature dependence of the hall angle . independently of the approach",

    "based on the proved sensitivity of the hall angle to the pseudogap @xcite we may speculate that this behavior reflects the opening of the pseudogap at temperatures much below @xmath13 .",
