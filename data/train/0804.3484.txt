    "the second one is that there is no general structure theory for infinite - dimensional lie groups , such as the levi decomposition and the fine structure theory of semisimple lie groups .    however , there are many interesting classes of infinite - dimensional lie groups which possess a rich unitary representation theory .",
    "many of these representations show up naturally in various contexts of mathematical physics ( ) , where the lie algebra @xmath6 of the group under consideration often contains an element @xmath7 , corresponding to the hamiltonian of the underlying physical system , for which the spectrum of the operator @xmath8 in the `` physically relevant '' representations @xmath9 is bounded from below .",
    "this suggests to study representations of infinite - dimensional lie groups in terms of semi - boundedness properties of spectra .",

    "the main result of section  [ sec:2 ] is a theorem which describes criteria under which the momentum set of a representation on a reproducing kernel hilbert space of holomorphic functions can be determined directly from the reproducing kernel .",

    "this result is a quite straight forward consequence of the definitions if @xmath0 is locally exponential , but for a general lie group we have to use some more sophisticated arguments .",
    "finally we explain in section  [ sec:4 ] that for the case where @xmath26 is the additive group of a locally convex space , semi - bounded representations are precisely those obtained by functional calculus from spectral measures supported by semi - equicontinuous subsets of the dual space .    for the future ,",
