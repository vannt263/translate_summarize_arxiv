    "_ ion channeling ( ic ) : _ here we review the experimental effect of ion channeling , which has been found to affect the results . in general only a fraction ( known as the quenching factor ) of the recoil energy deposited by a wimp is transferred to electrons and is converted into useful signal in the dama detector ( _ e.g. _  ionization or scintillation ) ; the remainder is converted into phonons and heat and goes undetected .",
    "hence measured energies must be corrected for this behavior to obtain the proper recoil energy , by dividing by this quenching factor .",
    "the dama detector is composed of nai , with quenching factors @xmath108 and @xmath109 . yet , recently , the dama collaboration pointed out that some fraction of the nuclei may recoil along a crystal axis or plane @xcite , in which cases the recoiling nucleus can travel relatively large distances along the `` channels '' between the crystal atoms ( as opposed to the typical case , where the recoiling nucleus quickly collides with nearby atoms ) .",
    "such recoiling nuclei lose very little energy to other atoms and to heat , giving nearly all their energy to electrons . for these cases",
    "the measured energy corresponds very nearly to the energy deposited by the wimp and thus have quenching factor @xmath110 . as a consequence ,",
    "the detector is sensitive to lower mass wimps than previously thought .",
    "the new channeling studies revived the possiblity of dama s compatibility with other data sets , particularly at low masses .",
    "we shall examine the dama results both with and without including the ic effect .",

    "the dama detectors do not strongly discriminate between wimp scatters and background events , so an unknown and possibly large portion of the total observed events may be due to backgrounds ( the backgrounds are presumed not to vary with time and do not contribute to the modulation ) . in the same manner as the various null experiments , we use the total number of events observed by dama to constrain the parameter space by excluding regions that would predict more events than observed",
    ". we will show regions excluded at the 90% level due to the total rate for dama .",
    "constraints will be shown with and without the channeling effect .",
    "note that some choices of parameters that produce the correct modulation signal may actually predict a total rate larger than observed and , hence , those parameter choices are incompatible with the full dama data set .",
    "numerous other experiments have searched for a dark matter signal , but all these experimental results , apart from dama , are consistent with no wimp signal .    _ direct detection : _ in our previous paper @xcite we discussed in detail our use of data from many experiments .",
    "we do not repeat this information here . in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to the most constraining experiments : cdms @xcite @xcite , xenon @xcite , and cresst  i @xcite .",
    "while coupp @xcite could be very powerful , insufficient information on the data runs is provided to reproduce their results and extend them to arbitrary couplings .    for the various null experiments , we define constraints in parameter space at a certain exclusion level @xmath113 , typically 90% , as the parameters for which the probability of seeing the experimental result is @xmath114 .",
    "parameters outside the corresponding contours would yield the observed result with a probability less than @xmath114 .",
    "we say the parameters within those contours are compatible within the @xmath113 level and parameters outside are excluded at the @xmath113 level .",
    "the probabilities are determined using different statistical values , described in our previous paper , in different cases .",
    "_ indirect detection : _ an alternative way to search for wimp dark matter is via indirect detection of wimp annihilation in the sun or earth . when wimps pass through these objects @xcite ,",
    "a small fraction may be captured , sink to the core , and annihilate with one another to produce a neutrino signal observable in earth - based detectors such as super - kamiokande @xcite ( super - k ) , amanda @xcite , icecube @xcite and antares @xcite .",
    "since the sun is mostly made of hydrogen ( which has spin ) , its capture of wimps depends primarily on the spin - dependent wimp / nucleon cross section which can thus be constrained .",
    "the most stringent indirect bounds are from super - k @xcite .",
    "however , super - k is not shown in the plots because their result can not be readily reanalyzed for a modified halo .",
    "the super - k constraints rely on the following assumptions : ( 1 ) the wimp / anti - wimp abundance is not highly asymmetric , which would suppress the annihilation rate ; ( 2 ) the annihilation cross - section is sufficiently high so that the capture rate of wimps in the sun ( via scattering off of nuclei in the sun ) is in equilibrium with the annihilation rate ; and ( 3 ) the wimp does not annihilate predominantly into the light quarks , which do not yield neutrinos in sufficient quantities and energies to be observed . for the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model , these assumptions are mainly satisfied for neutralinos in the parameter space of interest . in general , however , these assumptions need not be satisfied , so the super - k constraints should be applied with caution .",
    "we use two statistical tests to interpret the dama modulation data .",
    "first , we find the `` best fit '' regions in wimp parameter space to fit the dama data by itself .",
    "more specifically , we use a likelihood ratio method with a global fit of four parameters to find the preferred parameters to produce the dama signal , and plot these in the plane of the wimp / nucleon scattering cross section vs.  wimp mass .",
    "second , we use a @xmath115 goodness - of - fit test ( g.o.f . ) to indicate which parameters are compatible with the dama signal .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a short review of statistics or ref .",
    "@xcite for more extensive discussions .",
    "to determine the most likely parameters for producing the dama signal , we use the maximum likelihood method , based on the likelihood ratio @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the likelihood function , @xmath118 are the observed modulation amplitudes in each bin , and @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 are the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood for the observed @xmath118 .",
    "the denominator of the above equation is the maximum likelihood value @xmath123 .",

    "the @xmath131 limit corresponding to different c.l.s depends upon the number of parameters that have been minimized and , in the large data sample limit , is determined from a @xmath115 distribution with the degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . )",
    "equal to the number of minimized parameters .",
    "for the four parameters considered here , @xmath131 = 7.8 ( 90% c.l . ) , 16.3 ( 3@xmath0 ) , 34.6 ( 5@xmath0 ) , and 60.3 ( 7@xmath0 ) .",
    "the confidence region for dama as described here is , in fact , a 4-dimensional region in the ( @xmath132 ) parameter space .",
    "we shall be showing 2-dimensional slices of this larger region for particular cases , such as the @xmath133 slice corresponding to si only scattering .",
    "this is _ not _ equivalent to fixing @xmath133 and determining a 2-dimensional confidence region by minimizing only over ( @xmath134 ) . in the latter case , a confidence region",
    "will always be defined in a 2-dimensional plane while , in the former , there may be no slice in that plane if that plane represents a poor `` fit '' relative to the overall parameter space .",
    "note , as will be discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , the confidence regions obtained via this method yield the most _ preferred _ parameters for producing the signal .",
    "this method , in and of itself , does _ not _ imply parameters outside the confidence regions are necessarily a bad fit to the data ( or , conversely , that parameters inside these regions are a good fit ) and one should be careful using these regions to compare with other experiments .",
    "we use the alternative statistic of goodness - of - fit ( g.o.f . ) to indicate when parameters are incompatible with dama data , as opposed to finding the best fit region as we did previously .",
    "this statistic allows for comparison of dama modulation data both with the total count rate from the dama data itself and with null results from other experiments ( whereas it would be inappropriate to use the best fit regions for this purpose ) . to conservatively indicate parameters that are statistically compatible with the dama data set , this method indicates regions at which the @xmath115 falls within a given level using a simple @xmath115 goodness - of - fit ( g.o.f . ) test on the data .",

    "the super - k indirect detection results , which have not been plotted , can also change the conclusions . ref .",
    "@xcite have studied the constraints on neutralino wimps with different annihilation channels .",
    "if we use their results ( which have not been done for the new velocity measurements ) , the conclusion for the case of sd proton - only couplings is that virtually all neutralinos are incompatible with the combination of superk plus all direct detection experiments ; this statement assumes that there is no wimp / antiwimp asymmetry as well as the standard annihilation cross section required for thermal wimps .",
    "[ note that super - k would rule out sd proton - only couplings , not neutron - only or si couplings . ]",
    "the low mass region found in the si and the sd proton - only cases persists with a combination of these two couplings .",
    "that is , there are portions of parameter space with both si couplings and sd couplings to the proton that are compatible with all the direct detection experiments .",
    "_ neutron only @xmath144 : _ figure  [ fig : sdnlr ] shows the best fit dama regions for spin - dependent couplings for neutron only @xmath144 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sdngof ] shows that there is no region of wimp masses which can be compatible with all experiments in this case .",
    "while this sd neutron - only case is incompatible , non - zero sd couplings to the neutron are not in general incompatible : cases with mixed couplings ( with both @xmath145 and @xmath146 ) can still be found that are consistent with all the experimental results .",
    "our general result is that the new determination of the local standard of rest moves the best fit wimp masses to the dama data to lower values .",
    "we had hoped that the dama data , which is very dependent on the wimp velocity behavior , would change enough to allow new regions of parameter space compatible with all experiments",
    ". however , the bounds from the other experiments shifted by about the same amount , so that very little changed due to the analysis in this paper .",
