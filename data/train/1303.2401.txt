    "_ wise _ was designed to complete a map of the entire sky in 6 months . given that its mission lifetime was nearly 13 months",
    ", it was able to perform two full surveys of the sky and begin a third one .",
    "in each 6 month survey , _ wise _ obtained one 8.8  sec exposure in each operable band every 1.5  hours for a period ranging from 12  hours near the ecliptic plane to 6 months at the ecliptic poles .",
    "the four bands of _ wise _ were centered at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22  , which are denoted as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "all of the bands were employed from 2010 january 7 through 2010 august 6 .",
    "because of the successive exhaustion of the outer and inner cryogen tanks , images were not collected through @xmath12 and @xmath11 after 2010 august 6 and 2010 september 29 , respectively .",
    "the satellite continued to observe in @xmath9 and @xmath10 until 2011 february 1 @xcite .    to search for high proper motion objects with _ wise _ , i began by retrieving astrometry and photometry from the all - sky single exposure ( l1b ) source table , the 3-band cryo single exposure ( l1b ) source table , and the preliminary post - cryo single exposure ( l1b ) source table for all sources that lacked 2mass counterparts within @xmath13 .",
    "i chose to omit sources with close 2mass counterparts to focus my search on objects with either high proper motions ( @xmath14  yr@xmath8 ) or low temperatures ( @xmath15t7 at 10  pc ) . using topcat and stilts @xcite",
    ", i identified all groups of detections that had separations of @xmath16 and @xmath17  day between neighboring detections .",
    "thus , these groups were designed to contain all detections of a source during the time that it was observed continuously .",
    "each of these periods is referred to as an  epoch \" in the remaining discussion .    using the average coordinates of detections within a given epoch , i matched sources from different epochs , computed the proper motions ( @xmath18 ) for these matches , and identified the matches with @xmath18/@xmath19 . among the resulting high proper motion candidates , i omitted those that have been found in previous studies and that appeared extended or blended with other sources upon visual inspection .",
    "nearly all of the remaining candidates that were detected in @xmath11 and @xmath12 exhibited very red colors that were indicative of galaxies ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , and thus their putative motions were likely caused by resolved emission .",
    "however , one of these candidates was only modestly red , and hence closer to the colors observed for stellar sources .",
    "this candidate corresponds to wise  j104915.57@xmath22531906.1 ( hereafter wise 1049@xmath225319 ) and consisted of 12 , 19 , and 18 detections near 2010 january 9 , 2010 july 2 , and 2011 january 6 , respectively .",

    "the _ wise _ image is displayed on a logarithmic scale so that sources near the detection limit can be seen while keeping wise 1049@xmath225319 relatively unsaturated .",
    "to investigate the photometric properties of wise 1049@xmath225319 , i have plotted it on color - magnitude and color - color diagrams in figure  [ fig : cmd ] that are constructed from 2mass and _ wise _ bands . the absolute magnitude in @xmath10",

    "the position of wise 1049@xmath225319 in @xmath27 versus @xmath28 and is modestly brighter than the lower envelope of the l dwarf sequence , which is suggestive of an unresolved binary .",

    "finally , i note that the entry for wise 1049@xmath225319 in the all - sky source catalog , which consists of the 31 detections from the first two epochs , is flagged as a possible variable in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus , it may be an attractive target for detailed photometric monitoring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to measure the spectral type of wise 1049@xmath225319 , i pursued spectroscopy of it with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) at the gemini south telescope on the night of 2013 february 23 .",
    "the observations began with a 10  s @xmath2-band exposure for target acquisition .",

    "at the position expected for wise 1049@xmath225319 given its proper motion , a @xmath3 pair with @xmath4  mag was detected .",
    "i conclude that both objects are counterparts to wise 1049@xmath225319 and that they comprise a binary system since the images from dss , denis , and 2mass do not detect a source at that location .",
    "the binarity of wise 1049@xmath225319 is consistent with its overluminous position in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "spectroscopy was performed on the brighter ( southeast ) component , which i refer to as wise 1049@xmath225319  a. the spectrograph was configured with the 400  l / mm grating , the rg610 order blocking filter , and the @xmath30 slit , which produced data with a resolution of 5   .",
    "the slit was aligned to the parallactic angle and two 5  min exposures were collected .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "it matches closely with the spectrum of the l8 dwarf standard 2mass j16322911 + 1904407 from @xcite .",
    "based on a comparison to the other standards from that study , the uncertainty in this classification is @xmath31  subclass .",
    "the hydrogen burning limit is predicted to occur at @xmath32  k @xcite for ages less than 10  gyr , which corresponds to spectral types of @xmath33l5 @xcite .",
    "thus , wise 1049@xmath225319  a is very likely a brown dwarf .",
    "the presence of strong lithium absorption ( @xmath34   ) provides further support for its substellar nature @xcite .",
    "given the flux ratio of the pair , the secondary is probably a brown dwarf as well with a spectral type of late l or early t.      the binarity of wise 1049@xmath225319 has implications for the measurement of its parallax and proper motion . in an unresolved binary containing unequal components ,",
    "the orbital motion is reflected in movement of the photocenter , which can introduce errors into derived parallax and proper motion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the case of wise 1049@xmath225319 , its separation and the substellar masses of its components are indicative of an orbital period of @xmath2625  years . since this is much longer than the baseline of one year across which parallactic motion occurs , the measurement of parallax should be unaffected . because the astrometry for wise 1049@xmath225319 spans a timescale of decades , the measured proper motion is more susceptible to an error from the motion of the photocenter , but the effect is still quite small .",
    "for instance , using the @xmath2-band flux ratio , the amplitude of the shift of the photocenter is only @xmath35% of the total motion of wise 1049@xmath225319 over the period for which astrometry is available .",
    "however , if the flux ratio of a system varies with wavelength , then the position of the photocenter will do so as well , which can lead to errors in both the proper motion and parallax if they are based on multi - wavelength astrometry . to mitigate such errors ,",
    "i have excluded the gmos astrometry from the measurement of the parallax and proper motion .",
    "the other astrometric data are either from ir bands ( _ wise _ , denis , 2mass ) , within which the flux ratio should not vary as much as in the optical , or already have uncertainties that are larger than this effect . focusing on the ir astrometry offers an additional advantage ; because optical - to - ir colors of l and t dwarfs become redder with later types , the flux ratio of wise 1049@xmath225319 is probably closer to unity at ir wavelengths than that measured with gmos in the @xmath2 band , corresponding to a smaller motion of the photocenter .",
    "i adopted the astrometry from the 2mass point source catalog and the third denis release .",
    "for each _ wise _ epoch , i computed the mean of the coordinates that were retrieved from the single - exposure catalogs , with the exception of one detection from the second epoch with discrepant coordinates . for the dss images",
    ", i measured the positions of the counterpart to wise 1049@xmath225319 with the iraf task _ starfind_. the counterparts in 2mass and denis are partially blended with a star at a distance of @xmath36 to the north .",
    "the latter should be @xmath37  mag fainter than wise 1049@xmath225319 in the near - ir bands of 2mass and denis based on its optical photometry from the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "thus , the astrometry from the 2mass and denis should be negligibly affected by the fainter star . to place all astrometry on the same reference system , i computed the average offset in right ascension and declination between 2mass and the other surveys for sources within a few arcminutes of wise 1049@xmath225319 .",
    "these offsets were then applied to the coordinates for wise 1049@xmath225319 from dss , denis , and each of the _ wise _ epochs to align them to the 2mass system .    for",
    "the _ wise _ astrometric errors , i adopted the standard deviations of the right ascensions and declinations of the individual detections at a given epoch .",
    "for 2mass , i adopted the errors from the point source catalog . to estimate the errors for dss and denis",
    ", i assumed that their sum in quadrature with the errors from the 2mass equaled the standard deviations of the differences in right ascension and declination between dss/2mass and denis/2mass for stars near the flux of wise 1049@xmath225319 .",
    "the detection in dss ir is partially blended with a fainter source to the east . in an attempt to account for the effect on the astrometry , i doubled the error for its astrometry .",
    "the astrometry for wise 1049@xmath225319 from dss , 2mass , denis , and _ wise _ is compiled in table  [ tab : astro ] .",
    "i have performed least - squares fitting of proper and parallactic motion to the astrometry for wise 1049@xmath225319 using the idl program mpfit .",
    "the resulting measurements of the parallax and proper motion are presented in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "the parallax corresponds to a distance of 2.0@xmath10.15  pc . to test the validity of the errors , i fitted 1000 sets of astrometry that were generated by adding gaussian noise to the measured positions .",
    "the standard deviations of the resulting values of parallax and proper motion agreed with the uncertainties produced by mpfit . in figure",
    "[ fig : pm ] , the measured astrometric offsets after removal of proper motion are plotted with the offsets are expected for the derived value of the parallax .",
    "although the dss data have large uncertainties , they do provide tight constraints on the proper motion because of the long baseline , which in turn allows the 2mass and _ wise _ data to better constrain the parallax .",
    "with a distance of 2.0@xmath10.15  pc , wise  1049@xmath225319 is the closest neighbor of the sun that has been found in nearly a century @xcite .",
    "it is only slightly more distant than barnard s star , which is the second nearest known system ( 1.834@xmath10.001  pc , * ? ? ?",
    "the low galactic latitude of wise  1049@xmath225319 ( @xmath38 ) is likely the reason why it was not found in previous surveys for nearby brown dwarfs , which have tended to avoid the galactic plane .",
    "because of its proximity to the sun , wise  1049@xmath225319 is a unique target for a variety of studies , such as direct imaging and radial velocity searches for planets .",
