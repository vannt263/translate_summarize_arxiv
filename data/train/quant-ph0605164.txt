    "entropy is one of the most important concept in both statistical physics @xcite and information theory @xcite .",
    "it measures how much uncertainty there is in a state of physical system . in statistical physics , the entropy defined by @xmath5 depends on the number of states @xmath6 in an equilibrium system ; while in the information theory , the entropy @xmath7 is associated with the probability distribution in the eigenstate space of the density matrix @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to look into some fundamental issues from different point of view due to the common ground of two fields .    in statistical physics ,",
    "if we divide an equilibrium system into a large number of macroscopic parts , the total number of state in phase space is a product form from the number @xmath9 of state in each part , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "this precondition leads to that the entropy is an extensive quantity in statistical physics , i.e. @xmath11 , which is one of basis of the second law of the thermodynamics .",
    "however , a realistic system includes all kinds of interaction , and the dynamics at one site is no longer independent of other sites nearby .",
    "the facts implies that if we successively divide a system into two parts , we will face a situation that , within a certain length @xmath0 , the physics of a subsystem is not the same as the original system .",
    "this length actually defines a characteristic scale for the statistical physics , and physicists usually call it correlation length in the studying of different kinds of correlation function . from the point view of the information theory , for two subsystems a and b within the length scale @xmath0 , they are no longer independent with each other , and their entropy does not satisfy the extensive property , i.e. @xmath1ab@xmath12a@xmath3b@xmath4 .    on the other hand , correlation function plays a fundamental role in physics .",
    "almost all physical quantities , not only in condensed matter physics , but also in quantum field theory , are related to the correlation function either directly or indirectly .",
    "thus it devotes to understand many phenomena in both classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "physically , the correlation function denotes the amplitude of the dependence of physical variables between two points in space time . from the information theory",
    ", it also partially measures how much uncertainty of a physical quantity at one location if the quantity at another one is given .",
    "however , this uncertainty still depends on the quantity itself .",
    "for example , in quantum system , the diagonal correlation function usually differs from the off - diagonal correlation function .",
    "therefore , in order to learn the dependence between two separated systems , it is important to ask such a question : to what extent that the equality @xmath1ab@xmath13a@xmath3b@xmath4 is violated .",
    "this question introduces a concept in the information theory , i.e. mutual information , which is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the entropy of the corresponding reduced density matrix .",
    "if @xmath8 is classical , it is the shannon entropy @xcite , otherwise it is the von neumann entropy @xcite of the quantum information theory . actually , all correlation functions @xmath16 between a and b can be calculated from the reduced density matrix @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 . the mutual information , which measures the common shared information , defines a more general operator - independent correlation between two subsystems .",
    "taking into account the role of entropy in the statistical physics , we would like to call it correlation entropy hereafter .    to have a concrete interpretation , it is useful return to intuitive understanding of the entropy itself . in the information theory ,",
    "the entropy is used to quantify the physical resource ( in unit of classical bit due to @xmath19 in its expression ) needed to store information .",
    "for example , in the exact diagonalization approach , if we want to diagonalize a hamiltonian of 10-site spin-1 chain and no symmetry can be used to reduce the dimension of the hilbert space , we need at least @xmath20 bits to store a basis .",
    "therefore , the correlation entropy actually measures the additional physical resource required if we store two subsystems respectively rather than store them together . as a simple example , let us consider a two - qubit system in a singlet state @xmath21 , we have @xmath1a@xmath22b@xmath22ab@xmath23 , which leads to @xmath1a : b@xmath24 . obviously , there is no information in a given singlet state .",
    "however , each spin in this state is completely uncertain .",
    "so we need two bits to store them respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation entropy is simply the twice of the entanglement , as measured by partial entropy , between two systems because of @xmath1a@xmath13b@xmath4 for pure state .",
    "the reason that we interpret the correlation entropy in this way is that besides the quantum correlation the state also has classical correlation . from this point of view",
    ", the correlation entropy is just a measure of total correlation , including quantum and classical correlation , between two subsystems .",
    "they go halves with each other in correlation entropy for pure state . for a mixed state ,",
    "the correlation entropy also measures the amount of the uncertainty of one system before we learn one from another . from the above interpretation for pure state ,",
    "it is then not surprising that the correlation entropy fails to measure the entanglement @xcite .    in the statistical physics ,",
    "the critical phenomena is the central topic . to have a complete understanding on the critical behavior , various methods , such as renormalization group @xcite , monte - carlo simulation @xcite , and mean - field approach etc .",
    ", have been developed and applied to many kinds of systems . in recent years",
    ", the study on the role of entanglement in the quantum critical behavior @xcite have established a bridge between quantum information theory and condensed matter physics , and shed new light on the quantum phase transitions due to its interesting behavior around the critical point @xcite .",
    "however , the entanglement is fragile under the thermal fluctuation and can be suppressed to zero at finite temperatures .",
    "then it is difficult to witness a generalized thermal phase transition in terms of quantum entanglement .    in this paper",
    ", we are going to study the role of correlation entropy in both thermal and quantum phase transitions .",
    "like the fundamental role of two point correlation function in the statistical physics , we are interested in the universal role of two - point correlation entropy in the present work . the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : toymodel ] , for the pedagogical purpose , we study a toy model and show that the thermal entropy is not an extensive parameter in such a simple system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : order ] , we discuss the relation between the reduced density matrix , long - range correlation , and the correlation entropy . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2disingmodel ] , we study the properties of the correlation entropy in thermal phase transition , as illustrated by classical two - dimensional ising model . in sec . [",
    "sec : isingmodel ] , we address the properties of the correlation entropy in a simple quantum phase transition of one - dimensional transverse field ising model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] , some discussions and prospects are presented .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ]",
    "for the pedagogical purpose and making our motivation more clear , we first have a look on a very simple model : a heisenberg dimer .",
    "its hamiltonian reads @xmath25 where @xmath26 are pauli matrices at site @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the coupling between two sites is set to unit for simplicity .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized easily .",
    "its ground state is a spin singlet state @xmath29,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with eigenvalue @xmath30 , while three degenerate excited states are @xmath31,\\nonumber \\\\ \\psi_2=|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle,\\;\\;\\ ; \\psi_3=|\\downarrow\\downarrow\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with higher eigenvalue @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , according to the statistical physics , the thermal entropy of the system vanishes at zero temperature .",
    "when the system is contacted with a thermal bath with temperature @xmath33 , the thermal state of the system is described by a density matrix : @xmath34 where @xmath35 because of su(2 ) symmetry of the heisenberg dimer , the single - site entropy @xmath36 of the system is always unity , and the entropy of the whole system is @xmath37 then we can see that @xmath38 both at zero temperature and finite temperatures . in high temperature limit , the asymptotic behavior of the correlation entropy is @xmath39 .",
    "so only when @xmath40 , @xmath41 , the extensive property of the entropy holds .",
    "the physics behind this fact is quite clear .",
    "it is the interaction between two sites that establishes a kind of correlation and then breaks the extensive property of the entropy .    for a large system",
    ", however , this correlation usually decays with the increasing of distance between two parts , and the entropy becomes an extensive quantity beyond a definite scale . only around the critical point where the phase transition happens , the system behaves like a whole and can not be divided into two part , and then the correlation entropy has long range behaviors .",
    "in many - body physics , the reduced density matrix of a one - body and two - body subsystem can be , in general , written as @xmath42 respectively . here",
    "@xmath43 are annihilation operators for states @xmath44 localized at site @xmath45 respectively , and satisfy commutation ( anti - commutation ) relation for bosonic ( fermionic ) states .",
    "the reduced density matrix is usually normalized as @xmath46 so that one has a probability explanation for their diagonal elements in the corresponding eigenstate space .    in spin system ,",
    "the reduced density matrix of a single spin at position @xmath27 takes the form @xmath47 for two arbitrary spins at position @xmath27 and @xmath48 , the two - site reduced density matrix generally takes the form , @xmath49 obviously , under some symmetry , the above reduced density matrix can be simplified .",
    "for example , if the state of @xmath50 spins is also an eigenstate of @xmath51 component of total spins @xmath52 and possesses the exchange symmetry , then eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinrdm_def ] ) can be simplified as @xmath53 in the basis of @xmath54 : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 . here",
    "the matrix elements can be calculated from the correlation function , @xmath59    with the help of the jordan - schwinger mapping @xcite , @xmath60 where @xmath61 stands for the pseudo fermionic creation operator for single particle state @xmath62 at the position @xmath48 , the element in the reduced density matrix ( [ eq : spinrdm_def ] ) can be reexpressed in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : defrdm ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath63 therefore , we can explore the property of long - range correlation in spin system through pseudo fermion systems .",
    "we first consider the long - range correlation in classical systems , e.g. ising model , in which the reduced density matrix takes the diagonal form , i.e. @xmath64 then , if there is no long - range correlation @xmath65 for @xmath66 , the two - site entropy becomes @xmath67 where @xmath68 where the normalization conditions of the @xmath69 and @xmath70 have been used .",
    "obviously , we have @xmath71 , which means that if there is no long - range correlation , the correlation entropy vanishes at long distance .",
    "on the other hand , if there exists long - range correlation , for example @xmath72 for @xmath66 and a constant @xmath73 , then @xmath74    now we study the correlation entropy in the quantum systems , in which the reduced density matrix usually is not diagonal .",
    "then , if the system does not have long - range correlation , @xmath75 for @xmath66 , the reduced density matrix can be written into a direct product form , i.e. @xmath76 then the reduced density matrices @xmath77 can be diagonalized in their own subspace .",
    "so in principle , we can have @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 are the probability distribution for @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "as we have done for the classical system , we then have @xmath83    in order to study its relation to the long - range correlation , now we express the correlation entropy in term of the relative entropy @xcite @xmath84 between the whole system and direct product form of two subsystems where @xmath85 . for hermition operators @xmath70 , the eigen - equation @xmath86 gives a representation of the correlation entropy in the basis @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , in the eigenstate space of @xmath88 , we have @xmath89 insert the identity @xmath90 , it becomes @xmath91 where @xmath92 and satisfies @xmath93 moreover , @xmath94 will become unit matrix if and only if @xmath95 . then @xmath96 taking into account the concavity property of @xmath97 function , i.e. @xmath98 we can have @xmath99 where @xmath100",
    "the above inequality becomes an equality if and only if @xmath101 is an unit matrix .",
    "therefore , if @xmath102 for @xmath103 , @xmath104 is not diagonal , then we have the desired result @xmath105    in the information theory , the inequality similar to the above result is called klein inequality @xcite . therefore the existence of the long - range correlation will lead to a positive correlation entropy ( [ eq : posvend ] ) .",
    "this observation is very important in understanding critical phenomena . according to the theory of either thermal or quantum phase transition ,",
    "the presence of the long - range correlation is crucial .",
    "however , different phase transition depends on the different long - range correlation .",
    "for example , in the superfluid phase of @xmath106he , the off - diagonal - long - range order , as suggested by yang @xcite , is necessary ; while in anther kind of condensate of exciton , it may require diagonal - long - range order @xcite .",
    "then the above results show that the non - vanishing positive defined correlation is a universal and necessary condition for all critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the physics in the above toy model is quite limited . in order to verify our analytical result and see the significance of the correlation entropy in the critical phenomena ,",
    "let us first study its properties in a thermodynamical system .",
    "one of typical examples is the two - dimensional ising model , which is certainly the most thoroughly researched model in statistical physics @xcite .    in the absence of external field , the model hamiltonian defined on a square lattice field reads @xmath107 where the sum is over all pairs of nearest - neighbor sites @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and the coupling is set to unit for simplicity . since the ising model is a classical model , the reduced density matrix of two arbitrary sites then takes the form @xmath110 in which the elements can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdmelements1 ] ) , and single - site reduced density matrix @xmath111    for simplicity , we only consider the correlation entropy along ( 1 , 1 ) direction , because the long distance behavior of the correlation entropy should be independent of the direction .",

    "right : @xmath123 above @xmath113 .",

    "it is well known that the two - dimensional ising model has two different phases separated by @xmath113 . below @xmath113 ,",
    "the system has macroscopic magnetization , i.e. , spontaneously magnetized , and its mean magnetization is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : isingmeanmag ] ) .",
    "while above @xmath113 , the thermal fluctuation destroy this order and the system becomes paramagnetic .",
    "therefore , it is not difficult to understand that the correlation entropy between two sites decay quickly as the distance increases .",
    "this fact implies that the extensive property of the entropy holds beyond a finite correlation length .",
    "so the physics in a small system can be used to described that for a large system .",
    "it is also the reason why in the monte carlo approach , a simulation on a small system at low temperature and higher temperature agree with the analytic result in thermodynamic limit excellently .",
    "however , in the critical region , as we can see from fig . [ figure_2dising ]",

    "moreover , since the correlation entropy comprises all kinds of two - point correlation function in its expression , it can tell us more details about the critical phenomena . at the critical point , @xmath124",

    "[ figure_2dcri_exp ] .",
    "then the critical exponents of @xmath134 below @xmath113 is 3/4 , which is consistent with the critical exponent 1/8 of @xmath137 . while in the critical region above @xmath113",
    ", @xmath138 vanishes and the dominating term in @xmath119 becomes the correlation function .",
    "then @xmath134 scales like @xmath139 which is the same as the specific heat @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , the critical exponent now becomes 0 ( see the right picture in fig .",

    "moreover , we also note that the slope of lines in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ figure_2discri_ent ] is not the same .",
    "this is due to the fact that the exponent of the correlation function @xmath141 introduce the distance dependence in the @xmath142 above @xmath113 .",

    "the hamiltonian changes the number of down spins by two , the total space of system then can be divided by the parity of the number of down spins . that is the hamiltonian and",
    "the parity operator @xmath145 can be simultaneously diagonalized and the eigenvalues of @xmath104 is @xmath146 .",
    "we confine our interesting to the correlation entropy between two spins at position @xmath27 and @xmath48 in the chain .",
    "therefore we need to consider both single - site reduced density matrix @xmath81 obtained from the ground - state wave function by tracing out all spins except the one at site @xmath27 , and the two - site reduced density matrix @xmath70 obtained by tracing out all spins except those at site @xmath27 and @xmath48",

    "if @xmath189 , the ground state is a uniformly weighted superposition of the two nearest - neighbor valence bond state @xcite : @xmath190[3,4]\\cdots[l-1,l]\\nonumber \\\\ & & |\\psi_2\\rangle=[l,1][2,3]\\cdots[l-2,l-1]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath191=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\rangle_i|\\downarrow\\rangle_j-|\\downarrow\\rangle_i|\\uparrow\\rangle_j).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the block - block correlation entropy can help us to understand such a dimer order .",
    "moreover , from the definition of our correlation entropy , it is also useful to introduce a characteristic length for the statistical system , below which the extensive properties of the entropy is violated .",
    "such a characteristic length has a non - trivial meaning , since the extensive property of the entropy in the statistical physics is only valid above this scale .",
    "a simple example is the molecule which is composed of some atoms . when we study the physics of molecule gas , we have to regard a molecule as a whole because of its internal order .",
    "only when the temperature is high enough to break its order , the atom then plays the important role to the statistical properties of the system .",
    "though we verify the non - trivial behavior of the correlation entropy in terms of spin systems , the rigorous relation between the non - vanishing correlation entropy and long - rang correlation is valid for all many - body systems .",
    "therefore , it is expected to provide more physical intuition into the critical phenomena , such as bose - einstein condensation and superconductivity from the point view of the correlation entropy .",
    "take the former as a simple example , the reduced density matrix between two sites in the space - time can also be expressed in terms of bosons operators @xmath192 in space representation . at high temperatures",
    ", @xmath193 vanishes as @xmath194 increases .",
    "only when the condensation happens , @xmath195 leads to a non - vanishing correlation entropy , just as what we have shown for the correlation entropy in quantum spin system .",
    "in summary , the correlation entropy plays a universal role in understanding critical phenomena .",
    "its non - vanishing behavior not only help us have deep understanding to the entropy in the statistical physics , but also shed light on the long - range correlation in the critical behavior .",
    "this work is supported by the earmarked grant for research from the research grants council of hksar , china ( project cuhk n_cuhk204/05 and hku_3/05c ) and ugc of cuhk ; and nsfc with grants no .",
