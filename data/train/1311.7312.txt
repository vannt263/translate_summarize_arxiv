    "the cosmological constant is the simplest solution to the problem of the present - day acceleration of the universe .",
    "it is consistent with all the available observational tests , from the constraints imposed by cmb maps @xcite to bao picks @xcite  to sn ia constraints @xcite and the estimates of fraction of baryons in galaxy clusters through x - ray detection @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is an uncomfortable feeling from the fact that @xmath10  is not satisfactory explained as a vacuum state of some field theory : the energy scale observed for @xmath10 and predicted by quantum field theory badly disagree @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons why alternative explanations for the present - day cosmic acceleration have been put out since 1998 , when it was first detected @xcite .",
    "these proposals can be classified into two broad categories , each one related to a modification of a different side of the einstein field equations of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the modified matter approach introduces a negative pressure ( that counteracts gravity ) through the energy momentum tensor @xmath11  on the right - hand side of einstein equations .",
    "three types of models constitute this approach , namely quintessence models @xcite , k - essence solutions @xcite  and perfect fluid models ( such as the chaplygin gas @xcite ) .",
    "the quintessence and k - essence models are based on scalar fields whose potential ( in the former case ) or the kinetic energy ( in the later one ) drive the accelerated expansion .",
    "the perfect fluid models use exotic equations of state ( for the pressure as a function of the energy density ) to generate negative pressure .",
    "the weakness of k - essence and quintessence proposals lies in the fact that they require a scalar field to be dominant today , when the energy scale is low .",
    "this requirement demands the mass of such a field @xmath12  to be extremely small .",
    "one would then expect long range interaction of this field with ordinary matter , which is highly constrained by local gravity experiments .",
    "the difficulty with the perfect fluid models is the lack of an interpretation to the exotic equations of state based on ordinary physics .",
    "the second approach , called modified gravity , affects the left hand side of einstein equations @xcite .",
    "the subtypes of models in this category include braneworld scenarios @xcite , scalar - tensor theories @xcite , non - riemannian geometries @xcite , @xmath13  gravity @xcite and @xmath14  theories @xcite . in the braneworld models there",
    "exists an additional dimension through which the gravitational interaction occurs and by which the possibility of a cosmic acceleration is accommodated .",
    "scalar - tensor theories couple the scalar curvature @xmath0  with a scalar field @xmath12  in the action @xmath15 , allowing enough degrees of freedom for an accelerated solution .",
    "non - riemannian geometries are another alternative way to explore the geometrization of the gravitational interaction , but allowing new degrees of freedom describing different geometric structures than curvature .",
    "the @xmath13  gravity corresponds to models resulting from non - linear lagrangian densities dependent on @xmath0 ; @xmath14  theories build their cosmological models on manifolds whose connection is equipped with torsion instead of curvature",
    ".    all these mechanisms of generating the present - day cosmic dynamics are generally called dark energy models .",
    "our aim with the present paper is to contribute with the study of dark energy in the branch of modified gravity .",
    "we explore the cosmological consequences of a particular model in the context of the @xmath16 gravity testing the model against some of the observational data available .",
    "@xmath16 gravity is a theory based on an action integral whose kernel is a function of the ricci scalar @xmath0 and terms involving derivatives of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite is perhaps an early example of what we call @xmath16 gravity .",
    "a more recent example is the ( non - local ) higher derivative cosmology presented in refs .",
    "these works intend to eliminate the big bang singularity through a bounce produced by a theory based on an action containing the regular einstein - hilbert term plus a string - spired term .",
    "this last ingredient contains an infinite number of derivatives of @xmath0 , a requirement needed to keep this modified gravity theory ghost - free .",
    "references @xcite  are  @xmath17-gravity prototypes concerned not with the past - incomplete inflationary space - time but with the cosmological constant problem . in this regard",
    ", they try to address a similar issue that interests us in the present work : the cosmological acceleration nowadays .",
    "few years ago , we proposed a gauge theory based on the second order derivative of the gauge potential @xmath18  following utiyama s procedure @xcite .",
    "this led to a second field strength @xmath19  ( depending on the field strength @xmath20 ) and allowed us to obtain massive gauge fields among other applications , such as the study of gauge invariance of the theory under @xmath21 and @xmath22 groups when @xmath23 . in a subsequent work ,",
    "gravity was interpreted as a second order gauge theory under the lorentz group , and all possible lagrangians with linear and quadratic combinations of @xmath20 and @xmath24   or the riemann tensor , its derivatives and their possible  contractions , from the geometrical point of view  were built and classified within that context @xcite . in a third paper  we selected one of those quadratic lagrangians for investigating the cosmological consequences of a theory that takes into account @xmath0- and @xmath25-terms @xcite . that lagrangian appears in the action @xmath15  bellow ",

    "an important feature of @xmath15 is the presence of ghosts ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "a similar analysis shows that the model with @xmath212  produces a premature big rip for all the values of the pair @xmath262 in the 95% confidence region ; converselly , the model with @xmath213  engenders rebouncing within the 95% cr .    at last ,",
    "it is interesting to explore the features of the model for @xmath264 . extrapolating the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - behaviour ]  we verified that our model _ does not reproduce _ the decelerated phase typical of a matter dominated friedmann universe .",
    "besides , for @xmath265 the higher order model exhibits a behaviour compatible with @xmath266 where the equation of state is @xmath267 , i.e. the equation for a perfect fluid in the standard friedmann cosmology . on the other hand , a linear perturbative analysis shows that the perturbations in gravitation and matter fields do not grow for the equation of state with @xmath268 as given in ( [ w interval ] ) .",
    "therefore , the model proposed here can not describe the structure formation in the early universe .",
    "in this paper we have studied the phenomenological features of a particular modified gravity model built with an action integral dependent on the ricci scalar @xmath0 and also on the contraction @xmath269  of its covariant derivatives .",
    "the friedmann equations resulting from the field equation and the flrw line element involve sixth - order time - derivatives of the scale factor @xmath85 .",
    "we solved those differential equations numerically  but without any approximation  assuming a null cuvature parameter ( @xmath270 )  and pressureless matter .",

    "the present day value of the hubble constant is taken as given  and not constrained by data fit ",
    "the reason for that being consistency with the @xmath100-gas data analysis .",
    "four of the five parameters @xmath166   $ ]  are determined by the best - fit to the data  for the sn ia @xmath271 and fraction of gas in galaxy clusters @xmath272  available from refs.@xcite  and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the shape of the likelihood function @xmath273  in terms of @xmath181 shows that it is not possible to determine this parameter by maximization .",
    "we were forced to select some values of @xmath181 and proceed to the best - fit of the other parameters in the set @xmath166   $ ] .",
    "it was clear that the @xmath3  is statistically independent of the initial conditions , regardless the values of @xmath181 and the other best - fit parameters .",
    "in addition the sign of both @xmath192  and @xmath160  depend on @xmath181 , so that the behaviour of the model towards the future is not unique .",
    "the confidence regions for the pair of parameters @xmath220 , @xmath219 and @xmath262 were built .",
    "they showed that @xmath191  and @xmath192  are strongly correlated parameters , whereas @xmath191  and @xmath3  are weakly correlated quantities .",
    "this was confirmed by the results in table [ table - covariances ] .",
    "the plot of the confidence region for the pair @xmath274  is relevant to understand the future evolution of our higher - order model , which can exhibit either a premature big rip or a rebouncing depending on the value of @xmath181 and on the values of @xmath192  and @xmath160 .",
    "if additional data for high @xmath110 objects were used , as gamma ray bursts , for instance , they might reduce the uncertainties in our estimations of the jerk and the snap , and help us to decide if the rebouncing scenario is favored with respect to the big rip , or conversely .",
    "a positive feature of the particular @xmath16-model presented here is its consistency with the standard @xmath10cdm dynamics at recent times .",
    "maybe this is anticipated because the model has a great number of free parameters to be fit to the data .",
    "the high number of kinematic parameters ( i.e. , those involving acceleration and its first and second derivatives ) is a consequence of the model being of the fifth - order in derivatives of @xmath275 , a fact that could always make room for agreement with the observations .",
    "however , the freedom for bias is not unlimited .",
    "even with all these free parameters there is a constraint to the dynamics of the model towards the past .    besides this consistency with the standard @xmath10cdm dynamics ( at recent times )",
    "the model does not reproduce a large scale structure formation phase .",
    "this shows that just fitting a model to actual data is not enough to falsify or prove the model .",
    "general essential characteristic must be present too , as the instabilities allowing the large scale structure formation .",
    "therefore , the extra term presented in the action ( [ action ] ) should be ruled out as viable alternative for dark energy .",
