    "the topic of non - equilibrium dynamics of thermally isolated quantum systems has enjoyed a resurgence of interest , partly because of experimental progress with cold atoms .",

    ", the properties of eigenstates far from the edges of the spectrum may be more important for a non - equilibrium experiment than the low - energy parts of the spectrum , which is the traditional focus of interest of many - body quantum theory .",
    "a key question in the non - equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum systems is the thermalization or relaxation of a system prepared far out of equilibrium and subject to a time - independent hamiltonian .",
    "the value ( if any ) to which local observables relax is determined by the diagonal matrix elements @xmath0 of the corresponding operator @xmath1 in the eigenstates @xmath2 . the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth )",
    "@xcite proposes that the mechanism for the thermalization of non - integrable ( `` chaotic '' ) systems is the smoothness of @xmath3 as a function of eigenenergies @xmath4 .",
    "accordingly , diagonal matrix elements of local operators have been the subject of several studies @xcite .    off - diagonal matrix elements , @xmath5 ,",
    "provide further information about the time evolution @xmath6 of observables",
    ". in any finite system initially prepared in a combination of many eigenstates , there will be residual temporal fluctuations around the long - time average .",
    "these temporal fluctuations have been the subject of several recent studies , both numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of these fluctuations is determined by @xmath7 , weighted , of course , by the weights of the eigenstates in the non - equilibrium initial state .",
    "autocorrelation functions ( unequal - time correlators ) , interesting on their own and appearing in the formulation of fluctuation - dissipation relations in the `` relaxed '' state a long time after a quench @xcite , also are given in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the details of the temporal approach to the final relaxed value are also determined by the off - diagonal matrix elements of the corresponding operator @xcite .",
    "the approach toward the final value has been calculated in some model systems @xcite , although the connection to off - diagonal matrix elements has not been explored in detail .",
    "the ( statistical ) properties of off - diagonal matrix elements of local operators , @xmath8 , are thus related to a range of temporal properties of contemporary interest . in this work ,",
    "we provide a statistical study of these objects .",
    "we use hamiltonians that can be tuned between integrable limits , and provide scaling analyses as a function of system size .",
    "we thus study what happens to the distributions of @xmath8 as a function of distance from integrability , as well as how the thermodynamic limit is approached .",
    "some statistical aspects of off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath8 have appeared in ref.@xcite in the context of a non - equilibrium fluctuation - dissipation relation , and in ref .",

    "the initial occupancies are confined to a small energy window ( e.g. , @xcite ) , yet involve many eigenstates @xcite .",
    "we therefore pay particular attention to the behavior of the typical values of @xmath8 for small @xmath9 . at large frequencies ,",
    "the average @xmath10 falls off fast , exponentially or super - exponentially with @xmath11 .",
    "we pay special attention to the proximity to integrability , since it is well - appreciated that the relaxation behavior of chaotic or generic systems is quite different from systems subject to integrability @xcite or to ( many - body ) localization @xcite .",
    "we identify signatures of the @xmath8 typical to the integrable , close - to - integrable , and nonintegrable cases .",
    "close to integrability , we show that the matrix @xmath10 has a block - like or banded structure as a function of the energy difference ( frequency ) @xmath11 , which is visible as oscillatory behavior in the frequency - dependence of average @xmath7 values .",
    "we show that the distribution of the matrix elements in any small frequency window is peaked around zero , having a near - gaussian form for generic non - integrable systems ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) . at or near integrability",
    ", there is a stronger peak around zero , i.e. , the probability distribution is a mixture of two gaussian - like curves with unequal widths .",
    "this difference appears to be a basic distinction between generic ( non - integrable ) and integrable systems .",
    "we demonstrate how the proximity to integrability can be quantitatively characterized through the shape of the distribution of @xmath8 values , e.g. , through the size dependence of the kurtosis of this distribution .",
    "we find that the scaling behavior of the average value of @xmath7 is @xmath12 in terms of the hilbert - space dimension @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath7 at low frequencies tend to be larger than for the generic matrix elements , but the scaling follows @xmath12 as well .",
    "the scaling analysis is analogous to studies of the diagonal matrix elements @xmath3 and related quantities as a function of system size , performed , e.g. , in refs .  @xcite . as for the diagonal fluctuations @xcite",
    ", we can construct plausibility arguments based on an assumption of quasi - randomness of the vector coefficients of the energy eigenstates .",
    "as such assumptions are difficult to prove rigorously , we emphasize , as in ref .",

    "[ fig_freq ] , we have shown using shading densities the frequency - resolved distributions of values of @xmath95 .",

    "only the states in the central part of the spectrum ( within the dashed square region in fig .",
    "[ fig_aalphabeta ] ) are considered .",
    "the distributions are seen to be very nearly symmetric around zero .",
    "of course , the signs of individual @xmath8 values are not meaningful since every eigenstate carries an arbitrary phase . however , from @xmath98 eigenstates , one obtains @xmath99 matrix elements ; so the overall shape of the distribution ( roughly equal number of positive and negative values ) can not be altered by the choice of phases for the eigenstates .",
    "the solid curves are gaussian fits determined by the variance of the @xmath8 , centered at @xmath23 .",
    "far from integrability , this is seen to be a very good description .",
    "however , near integrability the distribution has a sharper peak than a gaussian , and appears to be a mixture of two near - gaussian distributions with different widths .",
    "this appears to be a fundamental distinction between ( near-)integrable and generic systems .",
    "we do not currently have a complete explanation for the extra peak in near - integrable systems , but we conjecture the following mechanism which provides some intuition . in the integrable case , there are many conserved quantities . the energy eigenstates can be grouped into subspaces or symmetry sectors by the eigenvalues ( `` quantum numbers '' ) of the operators corresponding to these conserved quantities",
    ". an approximate version of this statement is true close to , but not at , integrability .",
    "an operator @xmath1 corresponding to a local observable , when acting on an eigenstate @xmath2 , changes the eigenstate only locally , i.e. , slightly .",
    "the resulting wavevector @xmath100 will thus be likely to have larger overlap with eigenstates having the same quantum numbers as @xmath2 , and much smaller overlaps with eigenstates having different quantum numbers from those of @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , @xmath8 is close to zero whenever @xmath86 and @xmath87 belong to different subspaces .",
    "of course , @xmath2 and @xmath101 are orthogonal even if they belong to the same subspace , so that the off - diagonal matrix element of a local operator is small anyway for large system sizes .",
    "the argument is that , when they belong to different sectors , the states differ additionally by having different quantum numbers , not only by being orthogonal , and this should make the inter - subspace matrix elements statistically much smaller than intra - subspace matrix elements .",
    "this line of reasoning intuitively connects to the idea that integrablility makes a system `` non - ergodic '' .",
    "however , the argument is difficult to make rigorous .",
    "it is easy to construct special operators that connect different subspaces , e.g. , if @xmath102 is a conserved quantity in a spin hamiltonian , the local operator @xmath103 will connect different subspaces .",
    "however , a generic operator is expected not to have such special relationships with many of the conserved quantities , since most conserved quantities in integrable lattice models have rather complicated form when expressed in terms of spatially local operators . although the explanation provided by this `` inter - subspace versus intra - subspace '' perspective remains only heuristic at this stage , our data for multiple system demonstrates that near - integrable systems indeed have a substantial number of extremely small matrix elements .    in summary , numerical observations on",
    "the families of systems ( xxz ladder , bose - hubbard chain ) investigated in this work indicate that , in quasi - integrable cases , the studied local observables tend to respect the symmetries that are dynamically conserved at exact integrability .",
    "we expect this behavior to be generic at ( near- ) integrability for local observables in these types of models .",
    "moreover , we conjecture that this behavior may also be generic in the class of integrable many - body systems at large , and for a wide class of local observables .",
    "the gaussian shape of the distributions for generic non - integrable points can be explained heuristically by invoking the central limit theorem .",
    "writing @xmath104 in terms of the eigenstates @xmath2 of the hamiltonian and @xmath105 of @xmath106 ( with eigenvalues @xmath107 ) , we can write the matrix elements as @xmath108 for non - integrable systems , the summands @xmath109 may be expected to behave like quasi - independent random variables .",
    "the central limit theorem then implies the gaussian distribution of @xmath8 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we stress that the randomness and independence of coefficients is a hypothesis and difficult to prove rigorously .",
    "this is in the same spirit as arguments for scaling behaviors of diagonal matrix elements or of inverse participation ratios based on similar randomness assumptions @xcite .",
    "the physical intuition for such randomness assumptions is that an eigenstate in the middle of the spectrum of a generic system is so complex that the coefficients behave as random and independent variables for many purposes .      in order to characterize the nature of the distributions at small and large @xmath29 , we fit the numerically obtained histograms to the sum of two gaussian distributions , defined as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the gaussian distribution with variance @xmath112 and zero mean , and @xmath113 .",
