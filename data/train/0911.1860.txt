    "the surface of saturn s haze - shrouded moon titan had long been proposed to have oceans or seas , on the basis of the stability of liquid methane and ethane at the ground level ( flasar 1983 ; lunine et al . 1983 ; lorenz et al . 2003 ) .",
    "ground - based radar observations ruled out the presence of a global ocean in the 1990s ( muhleman et al .",
    "1995 ) , but the presence of isolated lakes was not precluded ( campbell et al .",
    "a large , dark , lake - like feature subsequently named ontario lacus was detected at titan s south polar region by the cassini iss system in 2005 ( mcewen et al .",
    "2005 ) and hundreds of radar dark features with a variety of properties consistent with liquid - filled lakes were found in the northern hemisphere by the cassini radar system ( stofan et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the chemical composition of the lakes of titan is still not well determined .",
    "good quality spectral data of the ontario lacus have been obtained by the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer ( vims ) aboard cassini but the only species that seems firmly identified is c@xmath0h@xmath1 ( brown et al .",
    "2008 ) ; the atmosphere contains so much ch@xmath5 that it is very difficult to detect the surface liquid phase of this molecule even if it is dominant in the lakes . because the detection of other compounds in the lakes of titan remains challenging in the absence of in situ measurements , the only way to get",
    "a good estimate of the chemical composition of these lakes is to elaborate a thermodynamic model based on theoretical calculations and laboratory data .",
    "several models , that investigate the influence of photochemistry and the atmospheric composition on the chemical composition of liquids formed on the surface of titan , have been elaborated in the pre - cassini years ( lunine et al . 1983 ; dubouloz et al . 1989 ; mckay et al . 1993 ; tokano 2005 ) . based on atmospheric observations these models assumed surface bodies of liquid on titan to contain a mixture of c@xmath0h@xmath1 , ch@xmath5 and n@xmath0 and a large number of dissolved minor species .",

    "our calculations in the framework of thermodynamic equilibrium have been performed for two different regions of titan s surface .",
    "the first zone corresponds to the vicinity of the landing site of the huygens probe , where the surface temperature was measured to be @xmath7 k ( niemann et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the huygens probe detected drainage - like features and a high surface relative humidity , so the presence of liquids can not be excluded in this area ( tomasko et al .",
    "2005 ; niemann et al .",
    "the second zone corresponds to the north pole of titan where the surface temperature is around @xmath2 90 k based on near - surface brightness temperature measurements ( jennings et al .",
    "2009 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the atmospheric pressure is assumed to be identical and corresponds to that ( 1.46 bar ) measured by huygens at the ground level ( niemann et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "figure  [ influ_t ] shows the variation of the composition of titan s lakes as a function of the surface temperature .",
    "it appears that the mole fractions of ch@xmath5 , n@xmath0 , co and ar decrease with the increase of temperature , while the mole fraction of c@xmath0h@xmath1 and of the precipitates increase .",
    "this is due to the vapor pressure of c@xmath0h@xmath1 , whose temperature dependence is lower than those of ch@xmath5 , n@xmath0 , co and ar .",
    "figure  [ influ_ch4 ] displays the variation of the composition of the lakes of titan as a function of the atmospheric ch@xmath5 mole fraction at the ground level , assuming a surface temperature of @xmath7 k. it shows that an increase of the ch@xmath5 atmospheric mixing ratio enhances its corresponding mole fraction in the liquid , as well as those of n@xmath0 , co and ar .",
    "interestingly enough , hcn is the only compound reaching saturation within the considered ranges of temperature and atmospheric methane mole fraction .",
    "indeed , the hcn mole fraction represented as a function of the soil temperature in figure  [ influ_t ] panel ( e ) corresponds to the saturation limit for any temperature lower than 94.5 k ( change of the curve s slope ) .",
    "this is due to the solubility of this compound diminishing with decreasing temperature .",
    "moreover , figure  [ influ_ch4 ] panel ( c ) shows that when @xmath8 is larger than @xmath9 , the lake is saturated in hcn . because it is more dense than the liquid m@xmath10mol while that of solid hcn is lower than @xmath11 m@xmath10mol . ] , the non - dissolved hcn should sink in the lakes of titan .",

    "the vertical dashed line corresponds to the surface temperature of @xmath7 k measured by huygens.,width=321 ]    table [ nomcompo ] gives the mole fractions of the main compounds in lakes formed on the surface of titan and shows that , whatever the considered site , their composition is dominated by c@xmath0h@xmath1 , c@xmath3h@xmath4 , ch@xmath5 , hcn , c@xmath5h@xmath4 , c@xmath5h@xmath6 and c@xmath0h@xmath0 . on the other hand , with mole fractions much lower than 1% , n@xmath0 , c@xmath1h@xmath1 , ch@xmath3cn , co@xmath0 , ar , co and h@xmath0 are found to be minor compounds in the lakes .",
    "( a)(h ) : composition of lakes as a function of the methane atmospheric mole fraction , assuming a surface temperature of @xmath7 k. the vertical dashed line corresponds to the methane atmospheric mole fraction measured by huygens at the ground level.,width=321 ]    the use of more up - to - date thermodynamic data and the recent cassini - huygens measurements , results in our calculated composition of the lakes differing from that of the hypothetical global ocean determined by d89 .",
    "indeed , considering the d89 case most closely corresponding to actual titan conditions ( @xmath12 k , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ; see their fig .  1 )",
    ", they obtained mole fractions of c@xmath0h@xmath1 , ch@xmath5 and n@xmath0 of @xmath2 0.35 , 0.60 and 0.05 , respectively .",
    "the most striking difference in the comparison is that the mole fraction of n@xmath0 is more than 10 times lower in our results than in theirs , and some compounds considered as minor in the ocean of d89 are not negligible in the composition of our lakes .",
    "however , our model reproduces the results of d89 when we adopt precisely the same thermodynamic parameters .",
    "the fact that relatively small differences ( order of a few percent ) between our thermodynamic data extracted from the nist database and those of d89 lead to significantly different results illustrates the non - linearity of the system of equations determining the composition of the liquid .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the errors on the predicted mole fractions of the different species because our model is based on thermodynamic data much of which is provided either without uncertainties or is derived from extrapolation of data to low temperature .",
    "however , numerical tests aiming to investigate the sensitivity of our model to the photochemical models we employ indicate that a @xmath15 30% variation of the c@xmath0h@xmath1 precipitation rate induces similar variations for the c@xmath3h@xmath4 to c@xmath1h@xmath1 lake mole fractions but poorly alters the n@xmath0 to c@xmath0h@xmath1 lake mole fractions given in table 3 . moreover , as shown by fig .",
    "2 , a variation of the methane atmospheric abundance hardly affects the lake mole fractions of the precipitates .",
    "pure numerical errors due to the algorithm have been estimated absolutely negligible .",
    "we also outline that the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium between the lakes and the atmosphere is a crude approximation since in fact the humidity and temperature of the atmosphere in contact with the lakes is determined by dynamic processes such as convection and wind advection ( mitri et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "our solubility calculations imply that a number of species produced by methane photolysis and energetic particle chemistry in titan s upper atmosphere should be readily detectable with a mass spectrometer carried to the surface of a liquid - filled lake by a huygens - like entry probe ( coustenis et al .",
    "the measured abundances of multiple minor constituents in the lake , coupled to measurements and models of stratospheric abundances and production rates , and direct temperature measurements of the lake surface , will constrain lake properties that are of interest in understanding the methane hydrologic cycle .",
    "for example , at the winter pole a seasonally deposited upper - layer of liquid methane might exist on top of a longer - lived ethane - methane liquid reservoir by virtue of methane s lower density and limited vertical mixing in the cold lakes ( stevenson and potter 1986 )",
    ". such a transient layer would be bereft of minor components compared with our values thanks to the slow sedimentation rate of the high altitude aerosols compared to the seasonal ( meteorological ) methane deposition rate ; our solubility values provide a means of calculating the extent to which the longer - lived liquid reservoir below has mixed into the methane meteorological layer .",
    "( the extreme cold of the tropopause of titan prevents the hydrocarbon constituents other than methane and possibly ethane from passing directly to the lower atmosphere in the gas phase ; thus the lakes must be seeded by stratospheric aerosol sedimentation ) .",

    "the abundances of minor constituents compared to our values which assume accumulation over geologic time , coupled with the aerosol sedimentation rate , could be used to `` date '' the liquid reservoir and hence test whether they have been cycled on the  milankovitch \" timescale . for",
    "species that are chemically inactive and occur as gas only in the atmosphere , such as the noble gases , the lakes provide a second reservoir other than the atmosphere to measure abundances .",
    "variations from the atmospheric value of , for example , @xmath44ar/@xmath45ar , might hint at contact between the lakes and a much deeper crustal reservoir of liquid methane and ethane not in contact with the atmosphere ( hayes et al .",
    "finally , our results provide the chemical data needed to compute the amount of deposition of various hydrocarbons and nitriles in fluvial valleys in the titan s midlatitudes , as a function of the flow of methane runoff from convective storms , allowing potential tests of models of fluvial erosion ( perron et al .",
