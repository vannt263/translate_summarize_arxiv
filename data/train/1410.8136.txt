    "the recently claimed detection , at high confidence , of b - modes in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) polarization that can not be attributed to lensed e - modes by the bicep2 experiment @xcite was greeted with both enthusiasm and caution .",
    "if all or part of this b - mode signal were confirmed to be primordial , it would constitute the first detection of a smoking - gun for inflation , a direct probe of yet - unknown physics such as quantum gravity , and thus one of the most important discoveries in astrophysics , cosmology , and high - energy physics in the past several decades .",
    "however , a joint analysis of bicep2 and _ planck _ data @xcite showed that most , if not all , of the bicep2 signal was the result of the most severe , ever - present contaminant in the studies of cmb polarization : polarized emission from interstellar dust .",
    "this development does not slow down the search for primordial b - modes ; but it does highlight the need for a much - enhanced ability to understand and subtract foregrounds .     _",
    "planck _ has now established that even in sky regions away from the galactic plane , where the dust emission is minimum , the primordial b - mode signal is below that of dust @xcite . in order for a future b - mode experiment to detect a primordial signal ,",
    "the polarized emission from interstellar dust and its polarization pattern will have to be subtracted from the cmb sky at high accuracy .",
    "any systematic errors entering this correction will need to be carefully considered : even if they are small compared to the level of the dust signal , they may be imporatnt compared to the ( currently unknown ) level of the primordial signal .",
    "it is such a systematic effect that we describe here .",
    "currenty the subtraction of the dust signal is based on measuring polarized emission from dust at frequencies where it is dominant ( e.g. , @xmath0350 ghz ) and extrapolating the dust polarization pattern to frequencies dominated by the cmb and targeted by cmb experiments ( 60 - 150 ghz ) .",
    "the basis of this approach is that the dust emission spectrum is reasonably well - understood ( typically represented by a modified blackbody spectrum ) ; and thus the dust polarization pattern measured at 350 ghz can be extrapolated to lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "the polarization direction at 350 ghz is dictated by the magnetic field threading the interstellar clouds where the dust resides .",
    "if for example all emission originates from a single cloud , then the emission will be partially polarized in a direction perpendicular to the plane - of - the - sky ( pos ) projection of the magnetic field .",
    "the dust emission at 150 ghz should then be polarized in the same direction - since the polarization is generated by that same magnetic field .",
    "the validity of such an extrapolation breaks down whenever more than one `` cloud '' ( more than one dusty region with different temperatures and magnetic fields ) is contributing to the integrated signal along the line of sight .",
    "the reason is that the total linearly polarized intensity fraction and polarization direction is obtained by algebraic addition of each of the stokes linear polarization parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 along the line of sight . if the relative contribution from two regions with different polarization directions ( effectively different magnetic field directions ) changes between frequencies , so will the resulting polarization fraction and polarization direction .",
    "indeed , the relative contribution _ will _ change between frequencies if the two regions have different temperatures , due to the temperature - dependent black - body part of the dust emission spectrum .",
    "in this paper we use a simple two - cloud model to demonstrate that this effect could cause decorrelation of the polarization pattern between 350ghz and 150ghz maps .",
    "we calculate conditions under which the effect would be large in configuration ( rather than in fourier ) space .",
    "and we propose ways to correct for this systematic effect .",
    "we consider a simple case in which only two `` clouds '' of temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath5 and dust column densities @xmath6 and @xmath7 contribute to the total dust emission along a line of sight ( see fig .  [ cartoon ] ) .     two clouds with temperatures @xmath4 and @xmath5 , dust column densities @xmath6 and",

    "if the degree of polarization in a cloud is @xmath11 , then the polarized intensity will be @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we assume that @xmath11 is independent of frequency , although in the general case this is not so @xcite . in the case of low optical depth @xmath13 ( appropriate for regions of low dust emission , such as the low  dust - emission regions typically targeted by cmb experiments ) ,",
    "the ratio of polarized intensities contributed by each cloud can be written as @xmath14 this will be a function of frequency because of the blackbody part of the emission spectrum",
    ".    the polarization state of the dust emission from each cloud can be completely described by the stokes parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ( where @xmath3 is the total intensity ) .",
    "the polarization degree @xmath11 and polarization angle @xmath15 of the emission from a single cloud are related to the stokes parameters through @xmath16 when both clouds contribute to the emission along a given line of sight , the corresponding stokes parameters add : @xmath17 the polarization degree @xmath18 and electric vector position angle @xmath19 of the total emission then are obtained by inserting @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 into eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) .",
    "if the pos - projection of the magnetic field in cloud 1 lies in a direction forming an angle @xmath23 with that of cloud 2 , the polarization directions of each cloud s emitted radiation will similarly form an angle @xmath23 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can take the magnetic field of cloud 1 to be at an angle @xmath24 from the reference direction , and that of cloud 2 to be at an angle @xmath25 .",

    "the physically transparent picture depicted in fig .",
    "( [ twoofrho ] ) becomes much more complicated .",
    "however , there are still generally informatve trends .",
    "when the temperatures of the two clouds are different , severely misaligned cloud magnetic fields will result in significant differences in polarization degree and polarization angle between 150 ghz and 350 ghz for a range of possible parameters of our model .",
    "caution is then warranted when using 350 ghz data to extrapolate dust properties to 150 ghz , as the 150 ghz polarized emission map might look very different from the 350 ghz map .",
    "the polarization degree might differ by large factors ( more than a factor of 2 for the most misaligned magnetic fields , more than 20% if the pos magnetic field of the two clouds forms an angle higher than 75@xmath52 ) .",
    "similarly , the polarization angle can be up to @xmath82 different if the clouds are perfectly misaligned , and certainly higher than 20@xmath52 for clouds with severely but not perfectly misaligned pos magnetic fields ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "on the other hand , there are large parts of the parameter space where the polarization properties of the combined emission would look very similar at the two frequencies : if the pos magnetic fields of the two clouds form an angle of less than 60@xmath52 , then the difference in polarization fraction is less than @xmath84 and the difference in polarization angle less than @xmath85 , independently of the other parameters of our model .",
    "this behavior , as discussed in the next section , offers a straghtforward way to correct for this systematic effect , by masking problematic regions with severe magnetic field misalignments along the line of sight .",
    "the effect we have discussed here is intrinsic to all microwave experiments and is due to information loss due to line - of - sight integration .",
    "future experiments with greater sensitivity / angular resolution will not avoid this systematic uncertainty .",
    "however , if the magnetic fields of the contributing clouds form an angle smaller than @xmath53 , then the resulting change in the polarization properties maps from 350 ghz to 150 ghz is minimal ( at least under the assumptions of the simple model considered here ) .    our model can be improved in a variety of ways : e.g. , more than two contributing clouds along the line of sight , a physical model of dust properties and emission , and constraining the observed combined emission spectrum along a line of sight to agree within uncertainties with the observed one .",
    "additionally , in our model we assumed the degree of polarization to be constant across frequencies , and the frequency dependence of the dust opacity to be identical in the two clouds .",
    "any deviation from these assumptions will cause further change between frequencies in the ratio @xmath48 of polarized emission between the two clouds .",
    "further change in @xmath48 will cause further discrepancies between the maps in the two frequencies , up to the maximum difference , which is the difference between a state where cloud 1 completely dominates the polarized emission , and a state where cloud 2 completely dominates .",
    "there are two ways for future experiments to deal with the systematic effect we have identified here .",
    "the first is to calculate , for the specifications for each experiment , the magnitude of the error introduced by this effect in fourier space , and determine whether it is comparable to the level of the primordial signal they might claim .",
    "this would involve simulating the effect using a detailed dust emission model , a simulated 3-dimensional map of high - galactic - latitude interstellar clouds and their magnetic fields , and the specific instrument response functions , mapping frequencies , and analysis techniques .",
    "the second is to correct for the effect .",
    "although a detailed analysis in fourier space is beyond the scope of this letter , some empirical data do exist addresing polarization pattern decorrelation of the dust signal between different frequencies in fourier space .",
    "cross - correlation studies of the polarized microwave sky between frequencies performed by @xcite are limited to mid galactic latitudes ( lower than those targeted by cmb b - mode experiments ) and average on larger ( 10@xmath52 ) scales than those relevant for primordial b - modes .",
    "mid latitudes are llikely to be less decorrelated , because a larger number of clouds is likely to be present along each line of sight , which more frequently than not will average out the strong variations that are possible in the case of only two clouds",
    ". similar studies in @xcite at higher latitudes are limited to a smaller frequency difference ( between 353 and 217 ghz instead of 353 abd 150 ) . for larger frequency differences ,",
    "the decorrelation will be larger , because the difference in polarized emission fraction from each cloud will be larger ( see fig .",
    "( [ twoofrho ] ) ) .",
    "even so , the @xmath86 pattern decorrelation ratio between 353 and 217 ghz is found to be at @xmath87 ( of the dominant dust signal ) ; assuming that it woud similarly be @xmath88 at cmb b - mode mapping frequencies , if the primordial signal is at 30% of the dust , the systematic discussed here would be at 10% of the primordial signal , and if the primordial signal is at 3% of the dust , the systematic would be at the 100% level . depending on the level of primordial signal ,",
    "this effect could be of little concern , or very problematic .    in configuration space ,",
    "data are similarly not very constraining . if we were to make the simplistic assumption that each line of sight in a cmb b - mode experiment experiences polarized dust emission from two clouds and the magnetic fields in these cloud are randomly ( uniformly ) distributed , then the probability of a large , problematic ( @xmath89 ) misalignment of magnetic fields is 33% .",
    "the realistic scenario is much more complicated : the probability of severe misalignments depends on the number of clouds within the galactic disk projected to high latitudes , the number of higher - distance high - velocity clouds that may also intervene along specific lines of sight , the size of each of these clouds , the correlation length of the magnetic field within a single cloud , and large - scale correlations of the magnetic field within the galactic disk .",
    "certainly the sky at high latitudes appears `` patchy '' on the plane of the sky @xcite . by copernican arguments ( see also @xcite ) , it will also be patchy along the line of sight , with several distinct clouds , each with its own , potentially different , magnetic field .",
    "additionally , at high latitudes , interstellar clouds are most likely to be located nearby , from a few tens of parsecs to one galaxy scale height ( few hundred parsecs ) , and thus span large angular scales .",
    "( e.g. , the polaris flare cloud , @xcite , over @xmath90 across , galactic latitude @xmath91 up to @xmath92 , and the leo cloud , @xcite , @xmath93 across , @xmath91 up to @xmath94 ) .",
    "halo objects can also emit in microwave frequencies ( e.g. high velocity clouds , such as ivc 135 + 53 , @xcite with @xmath91 up to @xmath53 , @xmath95 across ) . only a few severe misalignments between such large ( in angular scale ) clouds",
    "may end up affecting a large fraction of the cmb sky .",
    "this systematic effect could , however , be _ corrected _ through stellar optopolarimetry .",
    "polarization of starlight induced by dichroic dust absorption traces the direction of the magnetic field in intervening absorbing clouds @xcite . if the optopolarimetric properties of many ( tens ) of stars within a single cmb b - mode beam were measured , and if these stars were located at various , known distances , then the magnetic field direction in the various clouds along each line of sight could be determined .",
    "such _ magnetic tomography _ of the interstellar medium could imeddiatey identify lines of sight with severe misalignments of the magnetic field along the line of sight , and these lines of sight could be simply masked from b - mode analyses , akin to the treatment of point sources . in the era of gaia ( e.g. , @xcite ) which will provide distance measurements to stars down to 20th magnitude , the bottleneck in such an endeavor will be the number of high - accuracy optopolarimetric measurements that can be performed down to very low polarization fractions characteristic of the regions targeted by cmb experiments .",
