    "the importance of spin observables in nuclear physics is in the fact that they can give more detailed information on the dynamics of the system .",
    "because spin observables are sensitive to the transition amplitudes , they can be good testing grounds to check the accuracy of a theory .",
    "traditional standard nuclear physics approach(snpa ) uses phenomenological potential models and current operators which satisfy the current conservation .",
    "snpa could explain many nuclear phenomena including total cross sections of radiative neutron capture on a proton .",
    "recently effective field theory(eft ) approach has been widely used .",
    "eft approach is model - independent , provides theoretical error estimation , and its accuracy can be improved in a systematic way .",
    "eft calculations showed good agreement with experiments and snpa calculations at low energies with relatively less number of parameters for many observables .",
    "however , most of the calculations are focused on unpolarized observables which are dominated by a few partial wave amplitudes",
    ". it would be interesting to check whether the same amplitudes can explain spin observables which are sensitive to the interference between the amplitudes .",
    "it was observed that there exist discrepancies between snpa calculation and experiments in the induced neutron polarization , @xmath0 , in photo - disintegration of the deuteron @xcite .",
    "recent pionless di - baryon effective field theory(deft ) calculation up to next - to - leading order showed good agreement with snpa at low energies , but showed conspicuous difference with both theoretical snpa calculation and measurements at energies larger than 8 mev @xcite . though it is not yet clear whether the differences in experiments and theory are genuine or not , it is important to check whether the same amplitudes used for @xmath0 can explain other spin observables and whether the difference between snpa and deft at high energies can be explained by increasing the accuracy of deft .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the left - right asymmetry in the polarized neutron capture on a proton , and the linear polarization of the photon in the disintegration of the deutron at low energies using the deft .",
    "we find good agreement with the results obtained from snpa at low energies , but the discrepancy becomes significant as the energy increases .",
    "we relegate details of the calculation to ref .",

    ", we can apply the transition amplitude of @xmath1 to the calculation of the amplitude of @xmath10 .",
    "it is noteworthy that kinematics makes the @xmath11 transition as a dominant contribution to @xmath10 while @xmath12 transition to @xmath1 .",

    "[ fig : coordinate ] shows the coordinate system we use in the calculation .",
    "we are interested in the asymmetry of out - going photons with respect to the axix @xmath15 , which is proportional to @xmath16  @xcite .",

    "there is another pc asymmetry , which is parallel and anti - parallel to the neutron spin .",
    "consideration of this asymmetry will be reported elsewhere @xcite . retaining the term proportional to @xmath18 in the differential cross section , we have = i_0()[1+p_n b ( ) ] , where @xmath19 is a transverse polarization of the neutron . at low energies , @xmath20-wave contribution will dominate , and",

    "our result agrees to that with rsc , but there is about 10  % suppression to those with av14 and nijmegen93 .",
    "another polarization observable @xmath26 , the linear polarization asymmetry in @xmath27 is defined as & = & ( 1+p_l^^l()(2 ) ) , + ^l()&= & , where the linear polarization is parallel or perpendicular to the reaction plane .",

    "pionless eft agrees with other theoretical calculations .",
    "comparison with experiment will confirm the accuracy of the theory because spin - dependent observables are more sensitive to the amplitudes than the total cross sections .",
