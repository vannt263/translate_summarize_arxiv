    "in the prediction and the interpretation of trap loss rates , an important parameter used is the escape velocity ( @xmath3 ) . which is defined as the minimum velocity an atom has to achieve in order to overcome the radiative forces to escape from the trap .",
    "this velocity is normally obtained through numerical calculations where a single atom is considered within the trap light forces .",
    "such simulations has been satisfactory in many cases , but real measurements are important to reveal facts not included in the simulations .",
    "the direct measurements of @xmath3 would be ideal , but so far nobody yet has devised a direct scheme to perform such experiments .",
    "so what has been actually measured is the so called capture velocity ( @xmath4 ) , defined as the maximum velocity of an atom traversing the trap volume that can still be captured into the trap .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is related to the value of @xmath3 , and @xmath6 can be considered as an upper bound limit for @xmath3 .    in a recent publication @xcite",
    "we have used a magneto optical trap loaded from a dark - spot zeeman tuned slower @xcite  to measure the capture velocity in a range of trapping light intensities from @xmath7 to @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "this range of intensity covers only one part of the interest when dealing with measurements of trap loss .",
    "recently collision experiments @xcite have covered a much broader range of intensities and the prediction for trap loss in this range demands the knowledge of @xmath10 .",
    "high intensity is however a difficult regime to simulate because effects such as fluctuations , polarization imperfection , the multilevel nature of atoms , etc .",
    "are hard to be included in the calculation .",
    "measurements of @xmath6 in this range , may give us a good idea about @xmath3 for the interpretation of collision experiments .",
    "in what follows , we provide a brief description of our experimental technique followed by our most recent measurement of @xmath6 and a plausible explanation for the observed behavior .",
    "this report should be considered as a complement to our previous work @xcite .",
    "to load our sodium mot we use a cold atomic beam from a zeeman slower where a dark spot is placed in the center of the slowing laser beam producing a shadow on the position of the trap .",
    "this results in a large capture of atoms in the mot , due to the the minimum disturbing effect of the slowing laser on the atoms in the mot region .",
    "this technique has been fully described in ref .",
    "@xcite . scanning the slowing laser ,",
    "different velocity classes appear in the outgoing beam of atoms .",
    "the distribution is narrow and the dependence on the slowing laser frequency and its width has been studied before for a wide range of laser frequencies@xcite .",
    "the peak velocity depends on the slowing laser frequency and basically obeys the relation @xmath11 = - @xmath12@xcite , where @xmath12 is the slowing laser detuning and @xmath13 is the wave vector .",
    "this outgoing velocity peak has also been investigated as a function of detuning of the slowing laser @xcite .",
    "the output velocity distribution from the slowing process is close to a gaussian distribution @xmath14 , where a is a normalizing constant and @xmath15is obtained from the previous investigations @xcite of the atomic distribution coming out from the slowing process .    the procedure to measure the capture velocity is as follows : the slowing laser is scanned ( @xmath165mhz / s ) as the number of  trapped atoms is recorded .",
    "if the laser frequency is far to the red , the atoms cross the trap volume too quickly and will not be captured . when the frequency is such that small velocities are present",
    ", atoms start to accumulate in the trap until the whole distribution is captured .",
    "the number of captured atoms for each laser detuning is well represented by the integral @xcite    @xmath17    @xmath18    this integral can be expressed as a combination of error functions , which provides an analytical expression for @xmath19(@xmath12 ) .",
    "this function is however very dependent on @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "1 we show @xmath19(@xmath20 ) normalized for several considered capture velocities . as the capture velocity increases , the curves for @xmath19(@xmath12 )",
    "are shifted towards higher values of negative detunings . to determine @xmath6 ,",
    "we have fitted the rising part of the measured spectrum with the best value of @xmath4 .",
    "the process is repeated for several trap laser intensities and @xmath6 is obtained as a function of  trap laser intensity .",
    "we used a trap laser detuning of @xmath21and a mot field gradient of @xmath22 . in figure 2",
    "we show our measurement of the capture velocity for a broad range of intensities .",
    "the dot line connecting the experimental points is only for eye guidance .",
    "the uncertainties comes from  the statistical fluctuations of the values obtained in the best fittings , due to the data scattering of different measurements .",
    "the behavior of @xmath6 as a function of trapping laser intensity for low intensities is as expected : seems to go to zero for zero intensity and as the intensity increases it reaches a smaller rate of increasing .",
    "this , in fact , agrees well with our previous result @xcite .",
    "the new feature here is that @xmath6 reaches a maximum value for a given intensity and start to decrease slowly after that point . in our case",
    ", the maximum seems to be around @xmath23 .",
    "since this is the total laser intensity when the six beams are considered , the maximum in @xmath6 is taking place at about @xmath24 per beam ( not far from saturation intensity for each beam ) .",
    "this results seems to confirm the discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the capture process might depend more on the damping part of the radiation pressure than in the restoring force of the trap . in this case",
    ", the maximum capture would correspond to the situation of optimum balance between the beams . and",
    "any further increase in intensity oversaturate the transitions and the power broadening thereafter compromises the atom distinction between the two counterpropagating laser beams . in such a situation",
    "the damping coefficient starts to decrease and the same occurs to the capture velocity .",
    "so far , after the peak capture velocity , we only observe a decrease of @xmath6 with intensity .",
    "the main consequence of this observation is that the escape velocity ( @xmath25 ) should follow a similar pattern . and",
    "such a behavior of the escape velocity with respect to the trapping laser intensity would mean that the effective trap depth of a mot has also a maximum , related with that position of @xmath3 .",
    "this maximum in the trap depth would imply the existence of a minimum for the trap loss rate , which would be consistent with the recent alternative interpretation for the behavior of the loss rate coefficient in mots as a function of laser intensity @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that such a dependence is very much related to the overall condition for the trap operation",
