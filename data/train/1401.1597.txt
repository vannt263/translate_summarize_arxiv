    "massive star cores collapse upon reaching a critical mass of iron - group elements ( `` iron '' ) . a massive",
    "`` iron '' core implies the presence of several convective burning shells , such as silicon and oxygen . if a star still holds part of its hydrogen - rich envelope , this envelope is also convective .",
    "the convective elements ( cells ) have stochastic velocity , hence stochastic angular momentum , and accretion of convective zones onto the newly formed neutron star ( ns ) may form intermittent accretion disks with stochastic angular momentum .",
    "each such temporary accretion disk can then launch two opposite jets .",
    "these ` jittering - jets ' might explode the star without any additional neutrino energy @xcite .",
    "interest in jet - driven core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosion mechanisms has grown in recent years following the failure of neutrino - driven explosion studies to reach a consistent and persistent explosion . over the years",
    ", neutrino - driven explosions @xcite , mainly the so called delayed - neutrino mechanism @xcite , were the most well - studied , with research groups running sophisticated multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations with ever increasing capabilities ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in many cases the simulations have failed to even revive the shock of the falling core material .",
    "recent results have shown that in more realistic 3d numerical simulations explosions are even harder to achieve @xcite . @xcite and @xcite on the other hand found it is easier to achieve shock revival in 3d simulations . @xcite and @xcite argued that the delayed - neutrino mechanism has a generic character preventing it from exploding the star with the observed typical energy of @xmath2 .",
    "even with shock revival , the typical explosion energy most numerical simulations achieve is only about @xmath3 , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the problems of the delayed - neutrino mechanism can be overcome by a strong wind , either from an accretion disk @xcite or from the newly born ns .",
    "indeed , where explosions with energies of @xmath2 were achieved , it seems the driving force was a continuous wind from the center ( e.g. , @xcite ; see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "such a wind is not part of the delayed - neutrino mechanism , and most researchers consider it to have a limited contribution .    among the different alternative explosion mechanisms",
    "@xcite , the most well studied are magnetohydrodynamics / jet - driven models ( e.g. @xcite ) . most of these mhd models require a rapidly spinning core before collapse starts , and hence are only applicable for special cases .",
    "recent observations ( e.g. @xcite ) show that jets might have a much more general role in ccsne than suggested by these models .",
    "@xcite and @xcite proposed a general jets - driven mechanism that in principle can explode all ccsne .",
    "the sources of the angular momentum for disk formation are ( 1 ) instabilities in the shocked region of the collapsing core , e.g. , the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) , and ( 2 ) the convective regions in the core .",
    "recent 3d numerical simulations show indeed that the sasi is well developed in the first second after core bounce @xcite and the unstable spiral modes can amplify magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the spiral modes with the amplification of magnetic fields build the ingredients necessary for jet launching .",
    "the latter angular momentum source , that of accretion from convective parts of the core and envelope , is the subject of this paper . in section [ sec : angularmomentum ] we derive the expression for the specific angular momentum of matter accreted from a convective zone . in section [ sec : models ] we apply the results to several stellar models and conclude that intermittent disks are likely to be formed . in the present study",
    "we emphasize the accretion of outer convective zones , i.e. , oxygen shell and outward , to examine the prediction for very low energy sne from neutrino mass loss during the formation of the ns @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : implicaitons ] we argue that such transient events are unlikely to be formed and summarize our main results .",
    "we assume that a shell consists of convection elements with equal mass and size , and a random velocity @xmath4 with a uniform probability density in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the convection speed .",
    "the contribution of one element to the angular momentum in the ( arbitrary ) z direction is @xmath8 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath9 is zero , but not the variance , which is @xmath10^{2}d\\omega}{\\int d\\omega}=\\frac{1}{3}(mv_{c}r)^{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta_{r } , \\label{eqvarj}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the angle between the element s location and the @xmath12 axis . for a thin shell composed of n elements distributed isotropically we have @xmath13 the standard deviation of the _ specific _",
    "angular momentum for a thin shell is then @xmath14 for @xmath15 the deviation is zero as expected .",
    "we take shells with width @xmath16 such that the difference between the free - fall times at the shell boundaries is several times the keplerian orbit time around the newly formed compact object .",
    "this ensures that during the collapse , a disk has time to form in case the specific angular momentum of the infalling matter is sufficient . to do",
    "so we need to derive the change in free - fall time with radius : @xmath17 the effect of rotation on the free - fall time is not taken into account , as we assume negligible rotation throughout the paper . the interplay between stochastic and global angular momentum",
    "will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we now take @xmath18 to be several times , denoted @xmath19 , the keplerian time on the ns surface or black hole ( bh ) last stable orbit , and derive the width of a shell that can form a temporary accretion disk @xmath20 in the calculations presented in this paper we take , somewhat arbitrarily , @xmath21 . using the keplerian orbital time @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the mass of the compact object and @xmath24 is its radius ( or last stable orbit , for a bh )",
    ", we derive @xmath25 then , assuming each element is a sphere of size @xmath26 ( which can be taken to be the mixing length , for example ) , the number of elements in a shell is : @xmath27 substituting ( [ eqtkep ] ) into ( [ eqn ] ) , and ( [ eqn ] ) into ( [ eqsigmaj ] ) , we get : @xmath28    the minimal specific angular momentum required in order not to fall into the compact object is @xmath29 which is also applicable for a ns , since @xmath30 finally , the ratio between the stochastic specific angular momentum at @xmath31 and the minimal specific angular momentum required not to fall into the compact object is : @xmath32 our condition for accretion disk formation will be @xmath33 .",
    "the specified @xmath12 direction is of course arbitrary , and over time the direction of the angular momentum from fluctuations will change .",
    "the accretion disk will be intermittently destroyed and then rebuilt with a different orientation .",
    "we present four stellar models constructed by modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa version 5819 ; @xcite ) , with initial masses of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the models are of non - rotating solar metallicity stars ( @xmath38 ) , and magnetic fields are neglected .",
    "all models were evolved well into the silicon shell burning stage , and have an iron - core mass of @xmath39 . due to stellar winds ( we use the so - called dutch scheme , e.g. , @xcite ) the final masses are @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the heaviest model , with @xmath44 , loses its hydrogen envelope and becomes a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star .",
    "the three lighter models become supergiants of different temperature and therefore color classification .",

    "using the mixing - length theory we developed an approximate expression for stochastic deviation from zero angular momentum of convective mass elements in convective regions of stars . in equation ( [ eqratio ] ) we derive the ratio of this specific angular momentum to the one required to form an accretion disk around the newly born neutron star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) . the ratio given in equation ( [ eqratio ] )",
    "contains dependencies on the newly - formed compact object properties ( mass and radius ) , as well as on the properties of convection - a typical size and velocity of convective mass elements and the location of the convection region .",
    "although not accurate ( e.g. @xcite ) , the mixing - length theory is adequate for the goals of the present preliminary study .    using mesa @xcite , we evolved four massive stars from main - sequence masses of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , almost until core - collapse . due to stellar winds the pre - explosion masses were @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the three lighter models were super - giants prior to explosion , while the heaviest model ( @xmath44 ) became a wr star .",
    "we assumed for the @xmath72 case that a ns forms , and for the heavier models a bh forms instead .",
    "the remnant object for the intermediate @xmath73 and @xmath74 cases is somewhat ambiguous , as strong convection begins at a mass coordinate similar to the upper limit of possible ns mass , though there might not be enough mass for disk formation and jets launching .",
    "applying our derivation for the ratio of stochastic specific angular momentum of accreted gas from convective regions to that required to form an accretion disk around the newly born ns or bh , equation ( [ eqratio ] ) with @xmath75 , we reach the following conclusions .",
    "( @xmath76 ) the hydrogen envelope has enough angular momentum to form a relatively long - lasting accretion , although this is perhaps irrelevant as the hydrogen detaches from the star .",
    "( @xmath77 ) the inner regions , notably oxygen and more so helium , have sufficient angular momentum to form a jet - driven supernova explosion .",
    "we studied several cases of massive stellar models where a bh most likely forms upon core - collapse .",
    "we show that the regions surrounding the newly - formed bh have large angular momentum deviations .",
    "a large enough fraction of the mass can be accreted onto the bh and form intermittent accretion disks , which in turn may generate powerful jets .",
    "such jets can facilitate a supernova explosion , leaving behind a black hole .",
    "the explosion time - scale is short relative to the dynamic response of the envelope to the loss of gravitational mass . in this case",
    "there will be no very low energy supernova such as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we instead argue that if the inner si - rich region of the core does not manage to form intermittent accretion disks , then the helium ( and in some cases the oxygen ) convective region will .",
    "as the helium convective region is more massive than the si - rich region the jets launched by these disks will carry more energy , and in the regime of the jittering - jets explosion mechanism the explosion will be stronger .",
    "_ namely , we argue that the failure of the inner @xmath78 of the core to explode the star will lead to a more violent supernova explosion , rather than a very low energy supernova . _    the stochastic deviation in angular momentum was derived assuming a spherically symmetric accretion .",
    "this symmetry might be broken by the standing accretion shock instability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or by the first intermittent jet episode @xcite .",
    "the study of asymmetric stochastic accretion is the next logical step for our proposed explosion mechanism .",
    "additional avenues of investigation are the possibility of stellar rotation , and more realistic modelling of convection , perhaps using hydrodynamical simulations ."
