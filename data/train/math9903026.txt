    "in the paper  @xcite pinchuk gave an example of a polynomial map @xmath0 with a non - vanishing jacobian such that @xmath1 is not a global diffeomorphism .",
    "let us recall his construction .",
    "we define the following auxiliary polynomials in variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 : @xmath4 and a polynomial @xmath5 then @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given by @xmath9    our aim is to give a geometric description of pinchuk s map . as in  @xcite",
    "we find the set of points at which @xmath1 is not proper .",
    "it allows us to divide the image of  @xmath1 into sets with constant multiplicity of fibers .",
    "finally we illustrate how @xmath1 transforms the real plane to these sets .",
    "let @xmath10 be a continuous map of locally compact spaces .",
    "we say that the mapping @xmath11 is not proper at a point @xmath12 , if there is no a neighborhood @xmath13 of a point @xmath3 such that the set @xmath14 is compact .",
    "the set @xmath15 of points at which the map @xmath11 is not proper indicates how the map @xmath11 differs from a proper map .",
    "in particular the restriction of @xmath11 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 is proper .",
    "this notion was studied in @xcite in the complex case and in @xcite , where @xmath15 is called an asymptotic variety .",
    "let @xmath18 be a curve given by @xmath19    [ p1 ] the set of points at which @xmath1 is not proper is the curve  @xmath20 .",
    "the set @xmath21 is a smooth curve having three connected components . furthermore    * for every @xmath22 @xmath23 , * for every @xmath24 @xmath25 , * @xmath26 .",
    "a behavior of @xmath1 is illustrated in figure below .",
    "a set @xmath27 has 4 connected components .",
    "the marked ones are mapped diffeomorphically to a marked area above the curve @xmath20 .",
    "two unmarked regions are mapped diffeomorphically to an area below  @xmath20 . indicated connected components of a curve @xmath21",
    "are mapped to indicated parts of the curve @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "a similar description of pinchuk s map was given in  @xcite .",
    "the author characterizes there another mapping from the class discovered by pinchuk .",
    "note that @xmath20 is not an algebraic curve although it has a polynomial parameterization .",
    "it follows from the proof of lemma  [ l4 ] that the zariski closure of @xmath20 in @xmath28 consists of  @xmath20 and a point  @xmath29 , where  @xmath30 is a complex solution of an equation @xmath31 .",
    "this shows that theorem  3 in  @xcite , where it is claimed that the asymptotic variety is algebraic , is partially false .",
    "a polynomial map @xmath32 is another counterexample .",
    "an asymptotic variety of this map is a right half line @xmath33",
    ". moreover points ( b ) and ( c ) in theorem  3 can be removed .",
    "we refer the interested reader to  @xcite , theorem  3.3 .",
    "our approach is based on the following observation due to zbigniew jelonek .",
    "[ j1 ] let @xmath34 be a complexification of @xmath1 .",
    "then the set @xmath35 of points at which @xmath1 is not proper is contained in the set @xmath36 of points at which the mapping @xmath37 is not proper .",
    "* easy exercise .",
    "@xmath38    the next result concerning complex polynomial maps was proved in  @xcite , @xcite :    [ j2 ] let @xmath39 be a dominant polynomial map .",
    "then the set @xmath15 of points at which @xmath11 is not proper consists of a finite number ( possibly 0 ) of affine algebraic curves .    to prove theorem  [ p1 ] we find the set of points at which complex pinchuk s map is not proper and then apply proposition  [ j1 ] .",
    "[ lc ] @xmath40 .",
    "[ l2 ] the following relations hold for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath11 , @xmath8 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 .    * proof . *",
    "the formula  ( [ e5 ] ) follows immediately from  ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "multiplying equation  ( [ e2.2 ] ) by @xmath45 gives @xmath46 . by  ( [ e5 ] )",
    "we have @xmath47 . substituting the right  hand side into above formula",
    "we obtain ( [ e6 ] ) .        to solve this system for a given @xmath49 it suffices to find roots of @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a monic polynomial of degree  6 with respect to @xmath52 .",
    "therefore a number of solutions of  ( [ e7 ] ) equals a number of roots of a polynomial @xmath50 .    for every @xmath53 with @xmath54",
    "there is a unique pair @xmath49 such that @xmath55 satisfies  ( [ e7 ] ) . namely @xmath56 observe that ,",
    "generically , the pinchuk mapping is a composition of a polynomial map @xmath57 and a map @xmath58 given by  ( [ e72 ] ) .",
    "we precise this idea in lemmas  [ l5 ] and  [ l51 ] .",
    "first we need some preparation .",
    "[ l3 ] the restriction of @xmath60 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 is a homeomorphism .",
    "a curve @xmath63 has two algebraic components : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the restriction of the polynomial function  @xmath41 to @xmath66 is injective and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "* we claim that @xmath69 . indeed , suppose that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "substituting @xmath72 into ( [ e5 ] ) gives @xmath73 .",
    "hence @xmath74 and by  ( [ e1 ] ) @xmath75 .",
    "therefore @xmath76  contrary to our assumption .",
    "now we describe a curve @xmath63 .",
    "assume that @xmath79 .",
    "then by  ( [ e1 ] ) @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "we obtain by  ( [ e1 ] ) in the first case @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath75 and in the second case @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "this finishes the proof .",
    "fix @xmath106 lying in the complement of above curves and take a neighborhood @xmath13 of @xmath107 such that @xmath108 is a compact set disjoint from @xmath109 .",
    "let @xmath110 be the set of all @xmath111 such that @xmath55 satisfies  ( [ e7 ] ) for some @xmath112 .",
    "by continuity of roots ( see @xcite , proposition  1.5.5 ) @xmath110 is a compact set .",
    "moreover , it follows from lemma  [ l6 ] that @xmath113 .",
    "hence @xmath114 .",
    "since @xmath115 , we conclude by lemma  [ l3 ] that @xmath116 is compact .",
    "therefore the map @xmath37 is proper at the point @xmath107 .",
    "now we show that the polynomial @xmath50 has no multiple factor in a ring @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "assume that it has .",
    "then @xmath118 has also a multiple factor .",
    "since @xmath119 can be rewritten as @xmath120 the only candidate for a multiple factor is @xmath52 .",
    "but @xmath52 does not divide @xmath121 contrary to our assumption .",
    "our next task is to show that lines @xmath124 and @xmath125 are not contained in @xmath36 .",
    "we will use the following property ( see @xcite ) : _ if @xmath126 , then @xmath37 is proper at a point  @xmath49 .",
    "_ here @xmath127 denotes a point in a general position , so @xmath128 .",
    "we have @xmath129 .",
    "thus for a generic @xmath130 a system  ( [ e7 ] ) has 4 solutions @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) such that @xmath133 and one double solution @xmath134 . by  [ l5 ] and",
    "[ l51 ] we get @xmath135 . hence by the above mentioned property @xmath136 .",
    "we show in the same way that @xmath137 . from [ j2 ] it follows that the set @xmath36 is either a curve @xmath138 or is empty .",
    "the latter is impossible because in this case real pinchuk s map would be proper and thus it would be a diffeomorphism .",
    "* suppose to the contrary that there are @xmath141 such that @xmath142 .",
    "an equation @xmath143 gives @xmath144 . combining this with equality @xmath145 we get @xmath146 .",
    "hence @xmath147 which contradicts the choice of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "[ l1 ] let @xmath152 be a polynomial function which is a local diffeomorphism .",
    "then the function @xmath153 is lower semi - continuous .",
    "moreover , @xmath154 is proper at a point @xmath155 if and only if @xmath156 is locally constant at @xmath157 .",
    "* proof of theorem  [ p1 ] . *",
    "it follows from  [ j1 ] and  [ lc ] that @xmath35 is a subset of @xmath158 . since an asymptotic variety does not have isolated points ( see  @xcite , theorem  3 ) , @xmath159 . from the topological point of view",
    "@xmath160 is an embedded line .",
    "hence @xmath161 has 2 connected components .",
    "we shall calculate a multiplicity of fibers in each of them .",
    "the curve @xmath20 cuts a line @xmath162 transversely at points @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "hence the points @xmath165 and @xmath166 lie on opposite sides of @xmath20 .",
    "one checks that polynomials @xmath167 and @xmath168 have 2 real roots ( e.g. we can use sturm sequence ) .",
    "hence @xmath169 and by lemma  [ l1 ] @xmath23 for every @xmath22 .",
    "now we show that @xmath170 .",
    "we have @xmath171 . the only real root of this polynomial is @xmath96 .",
    "since by [ l5 ] @xmath172 does not belong to the set @xmath173 we have @xmath174 .",
    "we check similarly that @xmath175 .    it remains to compute @xmath176 for @xmath177 .",
    "let @xmath178 be a discriminant of the polynomial @xmath50 with respect to @xmath52 . using any computer symbolic algebra program one can check that the polynomial @xmath179 is nonzero at a point @xmath180 .",
    "hence @xmath179 does not vanish on @xmath20 but a finite number of points .",
    "fix @xmath181 for which @xmath182 .",
    "we have shown before that @xmath50 has two real roots for @xmath183 .",
    "therefore by continuity of roots the system  ( [ e7 ] ) has two real solutions at a point @xmath107 . by [ l6 ] and",
    "[ l4 ] one of these solutions is @xmath184 .",
    "thus @xmath185 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath1 from @xmath21 to @xmath189 is a diffeomorphism .",
    "hence the curve @xmath21 has @xmath190 connected components homeomorphic to a line and its complement @xmath27 has @xmath191 connected components .",

    "the mappings @xmath198 ( @xmath68 , @xmath199 ) induced by @xmath1 are proper and unramified hence they are topological coverings .",
    "since sets @xmath200 ( @xmath68 ) are simply connected , these mappings are homeomorphisms . since @xmath23 for @xmath22 ,   @xmath197 consists of 2 connected components for @xmath68 .",
