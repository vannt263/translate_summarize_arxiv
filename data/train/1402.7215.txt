    "it is becoming increasingly apparent that biological evolution of organisms life history traits can occur on a similar time scale to their population dynamics @xcite , and that such rapid evolution can shape the ecological dynamics of interacting species @xcite .",
    "in particular , predator - prey and host - parasite interactions can be dramatically affected by rapid genetic variation within the populations @xcite , and we need to take this fact into account in food - web and epidemiological models .",
    "for instance , it was demonstrated in @xcite that rapid genetic variation can enlarge the period and modify the phase relations in predator - prey cycles .",
    "recently , using a parsimonious eco - evolutionary predator - prey model , morozov _ et al . _",
    "have shown that the interplay between a fast genetic variation within the prey and the selectivity of consumption of the prey by its predator can suppress large amplitude oscillations in the system @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the reported stabilization could occur even in the case when the carrying capacity of the prey is infinitely large .",
    "in contrast , the same system with non - changing life history traits of species would be globally unstable , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus , a rapid evolution could potentially provide an extra mechanism of persistence for trophic interaction in a highly eutrophic environment ( known also as the top - down control ) @xcite .",
    "this mechanism would answer the long standing open question in theoretical ecology about possible solutions of the paradox of enrichment : what factors can stabilize predator - prey interactions in the case the supply of resource for prey is large ?",
    "@xcite .",
    "the previous results on stabilization in the eco - evolutionary predator - prey model with prey structuring in a highly eutrophic ecosystems were obtained by directly simulating the underlying model equations for particular parameterisations of the model functions @xcite .",
    "obviously , this can not be considered as a rigorous proof of stability .",
    "furthermore , considering other functional parameterizations of the inheritance kernel as well as the selectivity of predation can potentially affect the results obtained only using simulations .",
    "thus , the central question is whether or not the main conclusions in @xcite on the importance of within population structuring on persistence and stability will be generic .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to explore in detail the mathematical properties of the eco - evolutionary predator - prey model @xcite .",
    "our analytical investigation is centred around two main issues : the existence of non - trivial stationary state(s ) of the model ( assuring the coexistence of the prey and predator ) , and the stability of the stationary state(s ) for a general family of functions ( kernels ) describing genetic inheritance within the prey .",
    "we also establish global existence and positivity of solutions of the model .",
    "mathematically we consider the following system of integro - differential equations ( which is a generalization of that in @xcite ) : @xmath0    where @xmath1 describes the distribution of prey individuals across the cohorts according to a certain life history trait @xmath2 , which can vary between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "hence the integration of @xmath1 over @xmath5 $ ] gives the total biomass of prey in the population , while @xmath6 is the total biomass of the predator at time @xmath7 . here",
    "we consider the structuring life history trait @xmath2 to be an abstract parameter : in practice this can be the growth rate , body length ( at the adult stage ) , individual mobility @xcite or it can be the animals personality @xcite .",
    "the life trait is genetically inherited , i.e. it does not change throughout the lifetime . for the sake of simplicity we assume that the predator population is genetically uniform ( i.e. there is no structuring of the predator population ) .",
    "the integral term in equation ( [ eq : zoo ] ) stands for the growth rate of prey due to the reproduction of all cohorts .",
    "the kernel @xmath8 describes genetic inheritance and mutation .",
    "each cohort can produce offspring with the life trait within @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the contribution to the growth rate of cohort @xmath2 due to reproduction of the group of cohorts with life traits in the interval @xmath9 $ ] will be given by the product of the population size of this group @xmath10 and the kernel @xmath8,with @xmath11 being sufficiently small .",
    "thus the kernel function includes both the reproduction rate of group of cohorts centred at @xmath12 and the probability of producing offspring with trait @xmath2 .",
    "the total contribution of all cohorts to the production of the cohort @xmath2 is given by integration of @xmath13 over the the entire interval @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the mortality of prey in the model is due to predation only ( i.e. we neglect natural mortality ) , which is achieved via a standard holling type ii parametrization , see e.g. @xcite , where @xmath14 characterises the saturation of predation at high densities of the prey .",
    "the vulnerability of the prey to predation is cohort - dependent and is described by the function @xmath15 , i.e. there is prey selectivity by the predator according to the life trait @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath16 is the food conversion coefficient describing the efficiency of transformation of the consumed prey biomass .",
    "the predator is subject to a natural mortality @xmath17 which is assumed to be constant .",
    "model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) can be considered as a standard rosenzweig - macarthur model ( see @xcite ) in which genetic structuring and rapid evolution has been incorporated .",
    "our model is similar to that of @xcite , where evolution of cohorts of predator and prey in a chemostat was considered . however , unlike the model in @xcite , here we allow mutations of the clones .",
    "in particular , the kernel @xmath8 can be constant which can model the scenario of perfect genetic mixing within the population .",
    "it is of importance to mention that we intentionally consider the carrying capacity of prey population to be infinitely large , i.e. we model predator - prey interactions in a highly eutrophic environment .",
    "it is well known that the same model without population structuring is globally unstable and the species persistence is impossible @xcite , thus the main question explored using model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) is whether or not population structuring and rapid evolution ( as well as selectivity of the predator ) can eventually stabilize this otherwise unstable system . note that by rapid evolution we understand here variation in the cohort distribution @xmath1 which occurs on the same time scale as the ecological dynamics ( i.e. variation of the total biomass of prey and predator ) .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we explore the model for arbitrary parametrisations of the vulnerability to predation @xmath18 and the inheritance kernel @xmath8 .",
    "we only make the following natural assumptions regarding the model parameters and @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21    global coexistence and positivity of solutions of model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) , based on the above assumptions for the parameters and integral kernels can be readily established for example using methods developed in @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that unlike in the case of  standard \" physiologically structured population models , see for example the classical size - structured models in @xcite ( and the references therein ) , in our model individuals are structured with respect to a genetically inherited property , which implies that there is no transport term in equation .",
    "this allows us to work in the framework of bounded operators . on the other hand ,",
    "recruitment is represented by an integral operator , which is of infinite rank , in general .",
    "eigenvalue problems involving integral operators are often difficult to analyse .",
    "see for example the recent papers @xcite , where structured population models with distributed recruitment processes ( modelled by an integral operator ) were analysed .",
    "we also note that even though the operators arising from equations - are bounded , positivity of solutions can not be immediately established for example from the variation of constants formula .",
    "this is due to the negative feedback between predator and prey populations .    in the next two sections we show the existence of the nontrivial stationary state ( coexistence state ) of the model for a particular class of kernels , which is actually a separable kernel of a finite rank .",
    "then we derive the characteristic equations to obtain the stability condition of the nontrivial stationary state . using the obtained generic condition we consider the stability property in a few particular biologically relevant cases , for instance , in the case where the kernel is constant .",
    "finally , we address the important question of the necessity of predation selectivity for the stabilization of model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) , i.e. whether or not the stability of the coexistence state is possible in the case @xmath22 .",
    "we summarize our results in the discussion section .",
    "note that model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) always admits the trivial stationary state @xmath23 . throughout the paper we assume that the kernel @xmath20 is strictly positive , but for the sake of completeness we note",
    "that if the kernel @xmath20 is not strictly positive then our model may admit stationary states of the form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 satisfies the integral equation @xmath26 for example if @xmath20 vanishes for every @xmath12 on some interval @xmath27 $ ] then any function @xmath25 which is supported on the interval @xmath27 $ ] will be , together with @xmath28 , a non - trivial stationary state .    in the next two sections we discuss the existence of strictly positive ( coexistence or `",
    "non - trivial ' ) stationary states of model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) .",
    "we start with the relatively simple case of a separable kernel @xmath20 . in this case",
    "the integral operator describing the recruitment process is of rank one ( at most ) .",
    "then , we will discuss the case of a finite rank approximation of the kernel @xmath20 , and finally , for a general kernel @xmath20 , we will reformulate the steady state problem as an eigenvalue problem for a bounded operator .",
    "assume that @xmath29 , for some functions @xmath30 , i.e. that the kernel is separable .",
    "we look for a strictly positive stationary solution @xmath31 .",
    "the stationary state equations read : @xmath32 we introduce the following notation : @xmath33 assuming that @xmath34 we obtain from equations ( [ sseq1 ] ) the following set of scalar equations for the variables @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 one can easily see that a unique positive solution @xmath31 of ( [ sseq1])-([sseq2 ] ) exists if and only if the 4-dimensional scalar system ( [ scalar1])-([scalar4 ] ) above has a strictly positive solution .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath37 hence , we obtain from ( [ scalar2])-([scalar4 ] ) a unique positive solution @xmath38 , as long as @xmath39 .",
    "substituting this into equation ( [ scalar3 ] ) yields a unique positive solution @xmath40 . from ( [ scalar1])-([scalar4 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath41 , and finally from equation ( [ scalar4 ] ) we obtain @xmath42 . hence the model admits a unique positive stationary state if @xmath43 the condition above is satisfied , for instance , in the case when the saturation @xmath14 is not very large and vulnerability to predation @xmath18 is large enough .",
    "the approach above may be extended to the more general case of the kernel : @xmath44 i.e. for a finite rank approximation of the kernel @xmath20 with non - negative functions @xmath45 . with @xmath46 and @xmath47 as defined in ( [ z1z2 ] ) , and introducing the new variables : @xmath48 the stationary state equations of model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) read : @xmath49 equations ( [ sseq3 ] ) lead to the following @xmath50 dimensional scalar system : @xmath51 condition ( [ sscond1 ] ) for a separable kernel suggests that for small enough values of the parameter @xmath14 one should be able to establish existence ( but not necessarily uniqueness ) of a positive stationary state . in particular , for @xmath52 the first and third equation of ( [ sseq1sep ] ) together yield    @xmath53    with this , the @xmath54-dimensional nonlinear scalar system [ sseq2sep ] can be cast in the form : @xmath55 where @xmath56    once a non - negative solution of system ( [ sseq3sep ] ) is found it can be substituted into equation ( [ sseqsepf ] ) to determine @xmath57 , which using the second equation of ( [ sseq1sep ] ) determines a unique positive @xmath46 .    to establish existence of a positive solution of system ( [ sseq3sep ] ) we utilise an idea which was employed for infinite dimensional problems recently , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to recast the non - linear problem ( [ sseq3sep ] ) as an eigenvalue problem for a parameterised family of matrices .",
    "that is , we rewrite system ( [ sseq3sep ] ) as @xmath58 where @xmath59    note that for any @xmath60 the matrix @xmath61 is non - negative .",
    "it follows from perron - frobenius theory that the spectral radius @xmath62 is an eigenvalue with a corresponding non - negative eigenvector .",
    "also note that the function @xmath63 is continuous for @xmath64 .",
    "it follows for example from gershgorin s circle theorem that as @xmath65 we have @xmath66 . hence if there exists a value @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , then there exists a @xmath69 such that @xmath70 and therefore @xmath71 is an eigenvalue with a corresponding non - negative eigenvector @xmath72 .",
    "we then normalize this eigenvector such that it satisfies @xmath73 note that the existence of a @xmath74 such that @xmath68 holds depends on the @xmath75 values , i.e. on the approximation of the kernel @xmath8 .",
    "in particular if the kernel @xmath20 is such that for some @xmath2 value it is concentrated on the diagonal point @xmath76 then again gershgorin s circle theorem implies the existence of a @xmath74 such that @xmath68 .    also note that if the kernel @xmath20 is such ( typically strictly positive ) that it can be approximated with @xmath77 such that @xmath78 for @xmath79 ,",
    "then the matrix @xmath61 above is positive , and the perron - frobenius theorem guarantees the existence of a strictly positive eigenvector @xmath80 .",
    "also if the matrix @xmath61 is positive , then it is clear that for any @xmath81 we have @xmath82 , hence it follows from the intermediate value theorem that there exists a @xmath69 such that @xmath70 .",
    "we summarize our findings in the following lemma .",
    "assume that @xmath83 , such that @xmath84 for @xmath85",
    ". then model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) admits a strictly positive stationary state for @xmath52 .",
    "next we rewrite system - as follows : @xmath86 where @xmath87 equations ( [ sseq4sep])-([sseq6sep ] ) can be recast in the more economic form : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is well - defined ( via the left hand - sides of equations ( [ sseq4sep])-([sseq6sep ] ) ) on @xmath90 and continuously differentiable .",
    "we would like to apply the implicit function theorem for @xmath89 to show that if the equation @xmath91 has a strictly positive solution then it also has a strictly positive solution for some small positive values of @xmath14 .",
    "to this end we compute the jacobian of @xmath89 at @xmath92 : @xmath93 hence if the determinant of the jacobian matrix evaluated at the a strictly positive stationary state is not zero then by the implicit function theorem a strictly positive stationary state also exists for small enough values of @xmath14 .",
    "note that the value of the determinant of @xmath94 depends on the particular finite rank approximation of the kernel @xmath20 .",
    "we briefly discuss here how the steady state problem can be formulated in case of a general ( i.e. , non - separable ) kernel @xmath20 .",
    "this case is challenging from the mathematical point of view since the integral operator describing the recruitment process is of infinite rank , in general .",

    "in particular , for the special case of @xmath52 and @xmath103 we have the following result .    [ ssgeneral ] in the case of @xmath52 and @xmath103 model",
    "- admits a unique positive stationary state .",
    "the proof of theorem [ ssgeneral ] is included in appendix a. it is worth pointing out that , unlike in the previous sections , we are able to prove uniqueness of the coexistence steady state . to prove the existence of a positive steady state in the most general case , i.e. without the assumptions @xmath52 and @xmath103",
    ", we could apply results from the forthcoming paper @xcite , but due to the technical difficulties involved this is outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this section we shall address the local stability of the coexistence stationary state of the model .",
    "to this end we linearise the model around the steady state , and analyse the arising eigenvalue problems .",
    "our model is semi - linear , and so we may invoke theorem 5.1.1 and theorem 5.1.3 from @xcite to justify that the stability results obtained in the section are valid .",
    "we linearise equations ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) in the vicinity of the stationary state @xmath104 and consider perturbations @xmath105 and @xmath106 of this state .",
    "we obtain @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we note that the linear problem above is governed by an analytic semigroup , hence the spectrum may contain only eigenvalues of finite multiplicity . to determine the possible eigenvalues @xmath110 we look for solutions of the linearised equations in the standard form : @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "this ansatz leads to the following eigenvalue problem ( with the assumption of @xmath113 ) : @xmath114    as we can see the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : stability_1])-([eq : stability_2 ] ) is rather complicated , in general , since it contains integral equations .",
    "nevertheless in the following subsections we discuss some interesting special cases when the eigenvalue problem becomes tractable , and we can deduce analytical stability or instability results .",

    "note that since we only want show the existence of a positive eigenvalue with a corresponding non - trivial eigenvector ( hence we are not characterising the whole point spectrum ) we do not need to worry about possible eigenvalues with eigenvectors for which @xmath120 . with @xmath119 from ( [ evalue3_1 ] ) we obtain ( for @xmath121 ) : @xmath122 using ( [ gvalue ] ) we obtain from ( [ evalue1_1 ] ) @xmath123 @xmath124    the equation for the eigenvalues can be derived by integrating ( [ main ] ) over @xmath5 $ ] which should give unity ( according to our choice of @xmath125 ) : @xmath126 we can simplify the expression above by taking into account the explicit formulae for the stationary densities @xmath127 in the case of a constant kernel @xmath20 . without losing generality",
    "we can assume that @xmath128 .",

    "the characteristic equation becomes analytically tractable and one can deduce sufficient conditions for the stability of the stationary state .",

    "in particular , when the kernel is constant and there is a perfect genetic mixing in the offspring in the prey population .",
    "the obtained characteristic equations allow us to construct the hopf bifurcation curve without the need for a direct simulation of equations ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) .",
    "although , to construct the hopf bifurcation curve one still need to solve transcendental equations ( e.g. ( [ im_2])-([re_2 ] ) ) , this task becomes substantially faster compared to direct simulations of the integro - differential equations .",
    "\\(iii ) for an arbitrary function @xmath18 , describing selectivity of predation , we analytically proved the stability of the coexistence stationary state in the case when the saturation of the predation @xmath14 as well as the length @xmath139 of the interval of variation of the life trait @xmath166 $ ] are small . moreover , for simple kernels ( e.g. @xmath263 or @xmath264 ) , by choosing concrete parametrisations for the vulnerability to predation @xmath18 , we can easily explore the stability properties in the case when the interval @xmath166 $ ] is not small .",
    "in particular , our investigation shows that for @xmath137 and @xmath156 , the stationary state turns out to be always stable for a constant kernel @xmath20 .",

    "\\(v ) the framework of stability analysis and stationary states search suggested in this paper is rather generic and can be implemented to other eco - evolutionary models involving integro - differential equations .    from the biological perspective",
    ", the analytical results obtained have clear interpretation .",
    "stabilisation of the otherwise globally unstable predator - prey system is possible as a result of rapid evolution , and the necessary ingredients of stability are : ( a ) sufficiently large genetic variation within the prey population ( for @xmath191 the length of the interval @xmath166 $ ] should be large enough to guarantee stability , see figure 1 ) ; ( b ) there should be some selectivity of consumption of prey by its predator with respect to the life trait , i.e. @xmath15 , the sign of selectivity has no pronounced influence on stability ( see figure 1 , as well as characteristic equation ( [ linear_a2 ] ) ) ; ( c ) the saturation in predation @xmath14 should not be too large .",
    "these requirements for stability are in a perfect agreement with the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "we should mention here that our study of model ( [ eq : zoo])-([eq : fish ] ) is by no means complete : several key issues are still need to be addressed . in particular , it would be important to prove ( or disprove ) the stability of the stationary state in the case @xmath18 is an arbitrary positive function and when the saturation @xmath14 is small ( see section 3.2 for details ) .",
    "derivation of an exact condition for the type of hopf bifurcation ( i.e. subcritical or supercritical ) would be of a great practical use .",
    "verifying the requirement that @xmath18 should not be a constant to assure stability is an important challenge for future investigation .",
    "it would also be necessary to consider another class of demographic kernels @xmath8 , which are gaussian - shaped and close to zero within large portion of the interval of @xmath166 $ ] except the area around their maximum .",
    "biologically such kernels model the situation where the reproduction of the cohort with the life trait @xmath2 would be centred around @xmath2 with only small probability for offspring to deviate from this value .",
    "this represents a biologically relevant case of asexual reproduction .",
    "we are planning to address the above issues in future work .",
    "finally , it would be rather natural to incorporate diffusion into model - .",
    "this would allow modelling of small random variations in the genetic trait in a deterministic fashion , for instance , this can account for random variation in the trait within the life time of an organism @xcite .",
    "structured population models with diffusion in the state space are attracting interest , see e.g. the recent papers @xcite . since diffusion has a smoothing effect , in general , it would be an interesting question to investigate whether the hopf bifurcation shown here can be sustained in the analogue model with diffusion .",
