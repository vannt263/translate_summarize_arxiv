    "recently , the lowest - lying baryon spectrum , composed of up , down and strange quarks , has been studied by various lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) collaborations  @xcite . at present ,",
    "most of the lqcd simulations are still performed in a finite hypercube and with larger than physical light quarks masses  @xcite , the final results can only be obtained by extrapolating to the physical point ( chiral extrapolation ) and infinite space - time ( finite - volume corrections ) .",
    "baryon chiral perturbation theory ( bchpt ) provides a useful framework to perform such extrapolations and to study the induced uncertainties .    in the past decades , the ground - state ( g.s . )",
    "octet baryon masses have been studied extensively in bchpt  @xcite . however , up to now , a simultaneous description of all the @xmath1 lqcd data with finite - volume effects taken into account self - consistently is still missing .",
    "such a study is necessary for a clarification of the convergence problem and for testing the consistency between different lqcd simulations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it helps determine / constrain the many unknown lecs of bchpt at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath2lo ) .    in this work",
    "we study the g.s .",
    "octet baryon masses using the eoms - bchpt up to n@xmath2lo .",
    "finite - volume corrections to the lattice data are calculated self - consistently  @xcite and are found to be important in order to obtain a good fit of the lqcd data .",
    "unlike refs .",
    "@xcite , the virtual decuplet contributions are not explicitly included , because its effects can not be disentangled from those of virtual octet baryons due to the large number of unknown lecs .",
    "in order to fix all the @xmath0 lecs and test the consistency of current lqcd calculations , we perform a simultaneous fit of all the publicly available @xmath1 lqcd data from the pacs - cs  @xcite , lhpc  @xcite , hsc  @xcite , qcdsf - ukqcd  @xcite and nplqcd  @xcite collaborations .",
    "the details of the calculation can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly summarize the main results .",
    "up to n@xmath2lo , there are 19 lecs to be determined . to make sure that n@xmath2lo bchpt is suitable for the description of the lqcd data , we have chosen two groups of lqcd data according to the following two criteria . for the first group ,",
    "we require @xmath3 gev@xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the spacial dimension of the lqcd simulation . for the second , we require @xmath8",
    "gev@xmath4 , @xmath9 gev@xmath4 and @xmath10 . in the following ,",
    "we refer to these two groups of lqcd data as data set - i and set - ii .",
    "we perform a @xmath11 fit to the lqcd data and the physical octet baryon masses by varying the @xmath0 lecs .",
    "the so - obtained values of the lecs from the best fits are listed in table  6 of ref .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we have fitted set - i using the nlo and nnlo eoms - bchpt .",
    "the values of the lecs @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are also tabulated in table  6 of ref .",
    "an order - by - order improvement is clearly seen , with decreasing @xmath16 at each increasing chiral order .",
    "apparently , only using the @xmath17 chiral expansion , one can not describe simultaneously the lqcd data from the five collaborations .",
    "the corresponding @xmath18 is about @xmath19 . on the other hand , in the n@xmath2lo fit of lattice data set - i and experimental octet baryon masses , @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , the values of the fitted lecs ( named fit i ) all look very natural .",
    "especially , the baryon mass in the chiral limit @xmath21 mev seems to be consistent with the su(2)-bchpt value @xcite .",
    "the fit to data set - ii yields a @xmath18 about @xmath22 and the fitted lecs look similar to those from fit i except @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the increased @xmath11/d.o.f .",
    "indicates that data set - ii is a bit beyond the region of applicability of n@xmath2lo bchpt .     +    in fig .",
    "[ nlo - nnlo - phy ] , setting the strange - quark mass to its physical value , we plot the light - quark mass evolution of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 as functions of @xmath31 using the lecs from table  6 of ref .",
    "we can see that the nnlo fitting results are more curved and do not describe well lattice data set - i . on the contrary",
    "the two n@xmath2lo fits , named fit i and fit ii , both can give a good description of lattice data set i. the rather linear dependence of the lattice data on @xmath32 at large light quark masses , which are exhibited both by the lattice data  @xcite and reported by other groups , is clearly seen .",
    "we have studied the lowest - lying octet baryon masses with the eoms bchpt up to n@xmath2lo . the unknown lecs",
    "are determined by a simultaneous fit of the latest @xmath1 lqcd simulations from the pacs - cs , lhpc , hsc , qcdsf - ukqcd and nplqcd collaborations .",
    "finite - volume corrections are calculated self - consistently .",
    "it is shown that the eleven lattice data sets with @xmath33 gev@xmath4 and @xmath34 can be fitted with a @xmath11/d.o.f .",
    "=  1.0 . including more lattice data with larger pion masses or smaller volumes deteriorates the fit a bit but still yields a reasonable @xmath35 .",
    "our studies confirm that covariant bchpt in the three flavor sector converges as expected , i.e. , relatively slowly as dictated by @xmath36 but with clear improvement order by order , at least concerning the octet baryon masses",
    ". a successful simultaneous fit of all the latest @xmath1 lqcd simulations indicates that the lqcd results are consistent with each other , though their setups are quite different .",
