    "the availability of beams largely differing in isospin content in nuclear reactions has dramatically increased interest in phenomena associated with the variation of that content . in the context of peripheral reactions , this includes interest in changes of the nuclear density profiles with the isospin content . in central reactions , the attention has focussed , in particular , on the dependence of isospin symmetry energy on density . the determination of that dependence would permit an extrapolation of the nuclear equation of state to the neutron matter limit @xcite .",
    "the isospin asymmetry has been used in central reactions for projectile - target tagging in the investigation of stopping @xcite",
    ".    this paper deals with the irreversible transport of isospin and other quantities in a nuclear system , as pertinent for reactions , for small deviations from equilibrium . in that limit",
    ", the irreversible transport acquires universal features and is characterized in terms of transport coefficients , that include the isospin - diffusion coefficients .",
    "the coefficients are derived here for the dynamics described in terms of a boltzmann equation set such as used in reaction simulations @xcite . the main diffusion coefficient or diffusivity , characterizing isospin diffusion driven by the gradient of asymmetry , is evaluated using free neutron - proton cross sections . in the past",
    ", other transport coefficients , viscosity and heat conductivity , have been investigated for nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently found that conclusions from comparisons of reaction simulations to data on stopping can be universally formulated in terms of the nuclear viscosity @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that the diffusivity can be of such utility as that other coefficient , for the systems with a varying isospin content .",
    "the past studies of irreversible linear transport for nuclear matter were primarily directed at momentum and energy .",
    "tomonaga @xcite and galitskii _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the low- and high - temperature limits for the shear viscosity and heat conductivity .",
    "danielewicz @xcite derived results for those coefficients valid in a wide range of nuclear densities and temperatures .",
    "hakim and mornas @xcite studied different transport coefficients within the walecka model following the relaxation - time approximation .",
    "our derivation of diffusion coefficients follows the general strategy of chapman and enskog @xcite , but here for a fermi system , with inclusion of mean - field effects such as appropriate for a nuclear system . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the diffusion coefficient concept qualitatively and make simple estimates for the nuclear matter .",
    "the modification of the boltzmann equation to extend it to fermions has been first discussed by uhlenbeck and uehling @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we formally solve the set of boltzmann equations for a binary system of fermions to find thermodynamic fluxes driven by specific thermodynamic forces and to find general but formal expressions for the diffusion and other transport coefficients .",

    ", these appendices are devoted to the definitions of macroscopic quantities , the continuity equations , the continuity equations for an ideal fluid , the transformations in the driving force for diffusion and to the algebra of collision brackets .",
    "diffusion and other irreversible transport processes occur when a system is brought out of equilibrium .",
    "the direction of those processes is to bring the system back to the equilibrium . for small perturbations , in terms of constraints that may be set externally , the system response is linear in the perturbation .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality between the induced flux and the perturbation is the transport coefficient .    in a multicomponent system with no net mass flow ,",
    "irreversible particle flows result if particle concentrations are nonuniform . for @xmath0 components ,",
    "there are @xmath1 independent flows and @xmath1 independent concentrations ( since the concentrations need to sum up to 1 ) .",
    "the flows are then related to the gradients of the concentrations with an @xmath2 matrix of diffusion coefficients . in a binary system",
    ", only a single coefficient of diffusion , or diffusivity , relates the irreversible particle flow to the nonuniformity in concentration .",
    "however , as we shall see , nonuniformities in other quantities than concentration , can induce a dissipative particle flow as well .",
    "our focus , obviously , is the binary system of neutrons and protons .",
    "however , for the sake of utility of the results elsewhere and for the ability to examine various limits , we shall consider a general two - component system of fermions .",
    "an extension of those results to bosons , outside of a condensation , will be trivial .",
    "the two components will be denoted 1 and 2 .",
    "then , for the particle @xmath3 , the density is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the particle number in some infinitesimal volume @xmath6 . with net density @xmath7 ,",
    "the particle concentration for 1 is @xmath8 and for 2 it is @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , with @xmath10 representing the mass of particle @xmath3 , the net mass density is @xmath11 , and the mass concentration for @xmath3 is @xmath12 .",
    "the differential particle concentration is @xmath13 .",
    "the different concentrations are obviously related and thus we have @xmath14 and @xmath15 . later in the paper , we shall primarily use the differential concentration @xmath16 as an independent variable .",

    ". another option might be to use as independent the differential flow defined as @xmath25    if the system is at uniform pressure and temperature , but there is a small concentration gradient present , the fluxes develop linear in the gradient , enabling us to write , e.g.@xmath26 these are so - called fick s laws .",
    "notably , the stability of an equilibrium state requires @xmath27 . since @xmath28",
    ", we have @xmath29 . for the differential flow",
    ", we have @xmath30 here , the differential coefficient is @xmath31 .",
    "so far , we assumed a system at a uniform pressure and temperature , with just concentration changing with position . if the variations in a system are more complex , other nonequilibrium forces than the concentration gradient can drive the diffusion .",
    "this will be explored later in the paper .",
    "general guidance regarding the forces which can contribute is provided by the curie principle .",
    "this principle exploits symmetry and states that the driving forces must have the same tensor rank and parity as the flux they generate .    for the system of neutrons and protons ,",
    "the differential concentration @xmath16 becomes a concentration of the isospin and the differential flow becomes the isospin flow , @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the differential diffusion coefficient becomes an isospin diffusion coefficient , @xmath33 , and for equal masses we expect @xmath34 .    it is popular to relate the concept of a diffusion coefficient to a diffusion equation .",
    "indeed , if we consider a uniform system of protons and neutrons at rest , but with the nucleon concentration changing in space , then , from the continuity equation for the differential density @xmath35 we get the familiar equation @xmath36 here , for @xmath37 , we have assumed a weak dependence on the concentration @xmath16 .    before turning to a derivation of rigorous results for the diffusion and other transport coefficients , it may be instructive to produce simple mean - free - path estimates for those coefficients .",
    "let us consider components of equal mass ( the mass then becomes a simple normalization coefficient in density that may be factored out ) and consider the gradient of concentration along the @xmath38 axis , in the medium at rest .",
    "if we take the three coordinate axes , then 1/6 of all particles will be primarily moving along one of those axes in the positive or negative direction , with an average thermal velocity @xmath39 , for the distance of the order of one mean free path @xmath40 , without a collision .",
    "considering the particles 1 moving through the plane at @xmath41 , they will be reflecting density at a distance @xmath40 away . including the particles moving up and down through the plane , we find for the flux @xmath42 with ( [ diffusedefine ] ) , we then get for the diffusion coefficient @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "a more thorough investigation shows that it is the cross section @xmath45 for interaction _ between _ the two species that enters the diffusion coefficient .",
    "let us now evaluate the magnitude of the isospin diffusion coefficient . at temperature @xmath46  mev and normal density @xmath47 @xmath48 , with @xmath49 mb ,",
    "we find @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "we will see this to be in a rough agreement with thorough calculations .    similarly to the above",
    ", one could employ the mean - free path arguments to determine the better investigated coefficients : shear - viscosity @xmath52 and heat conduction @xmath53 .",

    ", we find @xmath58 mev/(@xmath59 c ) and @xmath60 c/@xmath59 . up to factors , the shear viscosity and heat conduction coefficients play the role of diffusion coefficients in the diffusion equation for velocity vorticity and in the heat conduction fourier equation identical in form to the diffusion equation .    in the estimates above",
    ", we just considered the free motion of particles in - between collisions .",
    "if self - consistent mean fields produced by the particles depend on concentration , then this dependence , on its own , contributes to the diffusion . in the case of nuclear matter",
    ", the interaction energy per nucleon may be well approximated in the form quadratic in isospin asymmetry , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the interaction contribution to the asymmetry coefficient @xmath64 . at normal density , the coefficient is @xmath65  mev .",
    "the naive expectation for two - body interactions is that @xmath66 is linear in density . at constant net density",
    ", the quadratic dependence of the interaction energy on @xmath16 leads to the force @xmath67 , of opposite sign on protons and neutrons .",
    "the direction of the force for positive @xmath66 is to reduce nonuniformity in isospin . under the influence of this force ,",
    "a proton accelerates for a typical time between collisions @xmath68 and then , in a collision , resets its velocity .",
    "the described polarization effect augments then the proton flow by @xmath69 in comparing with ( [ lexp ] ) , after correcting for the local center of mass motion , we find that the polarization increases the diffusion coefficient by @xmath70 where @xmath71 represents the previous estimate in eq .",
    "( [ dest ] ) .",
    "it is apparent that the contribution of the polarization effect is negligible for temperatures @xmath72 .",
    "however , at temperatures comparable to @xmath63 , the contribution could be significant ; notably , at those temperatures fermi effects also need to play a role .",
    "the isospin diffusion induced by mechanical forces has analogy in an electric current induced by the electric fields .",
    "indeed , for large enough systems , the coulomb interactions can contribute currents altering the concentration and , for completeness , we evaluate the conductivity @xmath73 for nuclear matter , relating the isospin flux to the electric field , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the local electric field .",
    "the two components of the binary system will be described in terms of the quasiparticle distribution functions @xmath76 .",
    "the local macroscopic quantities @xmath77 are expressed as momentum integrals of @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the intrinsic degeneracy factor .",
    "different standard expressions for macroscopic quantities in terms of @xmath78 , such as pressure and heat flow , are listed in the appendix [ macroquandefine ] .",
    "the components are assumed to follow the set of coupled fermion boltzmann equations , @xmath81 the terms on the l.h.s .",
    "account for the changes in @xmath82 due to the movement of quasiparticles and their acceleration under the influence of mean - field and external forces , included in @xmath83 , while the r.h.s.accounts for the changes in @xmath82 due to collisions . in the following",
    ", we shall often denote the l.h.s .  of a boltzmann equation as @xmath84 .",
    "with @xmath85 and @xmath86 representing the differential cross section and relative velocity , respectively , the collision integral for particle 1 is @xmath87 here , @xmath88 is the pauli principle factor .",

    "the subscript @xmath92 and the primes in combination with the particle subscripts @xmath93 and @xmath94 are used to keep track of incoming and outgoing particles for a collision .",
    "other than in the context of particle components , such as here , the @xmath93 and @xmath94 subscripts will not be utilized in the paper . the collision integral @xmath95 for particles @xmath94 follows from ( [ boltzmann2 ] ) upon interchange of the indices @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "as it stands , the set of the boltzmann equations ( [ boltzmann1 ] ) , with ( [ boltzmann2 ] ) , preserves the number of each species .    in the macroscopic quantities ( [ macrodefine ] ) ,",
    "the distribution function @xmath78 gets multiplied by the degeneracy factor @xmath80 .",
    "when considering changes of macroscopic quantities ( [ macrodefine ] ) dictated by the boltzmann equation ( [ boltzmann1 ] ) , the changing distribution function @xmath78 continues to be multiplied by @xmath80 . in the equation ,",
    "the factor of @xmath78 for the other particle in the collision integral @xmath96 is accompanied by its own factor of @xmath80 . as a consequence , in the variety of physical quantities",
    "we derive , the factor of @xmath78 is always accompanied by the factor of @xmath80 , while , however , @xmath97 is not . to simplify the notation , in the derivations that follow ,",
    "we suppress the factors of @xmath80 , only to restore those factors towards the end of the derivations .    when the boltzmann equation set is used to study the temporal changes of densities of the quantities conserved in collisions , i.e.  number of species , energy and momentum , local conservation laws follow .",
    "those conservation laws are discussed in appendix [ continuee ] .",
    "irreversible transport takes place when the system is brought out of equilibrium such as in effect of external constraints .",
    "aiming at the transport coefficients , we shall assume that the deviations from the equilibrium are small , of the order of some parameter @xmath98 that sets the scale for temporal and spatial changes in the system",
    ". then the distribution functions may be expanded in the power series in @xmath98 @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 represent the consecutive terms of expansion and @xmath101 is the strict local equilibrium solution .",
    "the terms of expansion in @xmath78 may be nominally found by expanding the collision integrals in @xmath98 , following ( [ eq : approxstrategy ] ) , expanding , simultaneously , the derivative terms in the equations and by demanding a consistency , @xmath102 here , we recognize that the derivatives , themselves , bring in a power of @xmath98 into the equations and , thus , the derivative series starts with a first order term in @xmath98 .    while we nominally included the zeroth - order term in the expansion of the collision integral @xmath103 , the integral vanishes for the equilibrium functions @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the local kinetic chemical potential , velocity and temperature which are functions of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , consistent with the euler equations ( [ eq : eulers ] ) .",
    "notably , the vanishing of the collision integrals is frequently exploited in deriving the form of the equilibrium functions , leading to the requirement that @xmath110 is given by the exponential of a linear combination of the conserved quantities . in the context of specific transport coefficients , the boundary conditions for the euler equations ( [ eq : eulers ] ) may be chosen to generate just those irreversible fluxes , and forces driving those fluxes , that are of interest .    the equation set ( [ eq : dj0 ] )",
