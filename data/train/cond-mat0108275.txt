    "the process of translocation , in which a polymer worms its way through a narrow pore , is an event important to many biological systems .",
    "examples include the viral injection of dna into a host , dna packing into a shell during viral replication , gene swapping through bacterial pili , and the genetic technique of cell transformation by dna electroporation@xcite .",
    "there are also a number of recent _ in vitro _",
    "experiments on translocation , e.g. the electric field - induced migration of dna through microfabricated channels@xcite or through an @xmath5-hemolysin protein channel in a membrane@xcite .",
    "the driving force is an essential ingredient in the above process , as are the entropic and cooperative factors that arise from the connectivity of the polymer .",
    "an interesting statistical consequence of the latter is that the polymer faces an entropic barrier , since the number of available configurations is least when the chain is halfway through the hole . in this regard",
    "it shares similarities with other entropically controlled polymer systems , e.g. polymer trapping in random environments @xcite , dna gel electrophoresis@xcite or reptation @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the geometry of the obstacles around which the polymer must diffuse constrains the kinetics of the process .",
    "a number of recent theoretical works have shed light on the translocation process@xcite , mostly in the presence of a driving force .",
    "a common approach is to focus on the dynamics of a single variable representing the monomer number at the pore@xcite . due to its resemblance to the ` reaction",
    "coordinate ' for chemical processes , we shall refer to this parameter as the translocation coordinate .",
    "assuming that the segments on the two sides of the hole are in equilibrium leads to a force acting on the trapped monomer which can be derived from the entropic barrier mentioned before , as well as any chemical potential differences that may provide a driving force .",
    "the translocation problem is thereby reduced to the escape of a ` particle ' ( the translocation coordinate ) over a potential barrier .",
    "= 15    assuming _ brownian dynamics _ for the translocation coordinate , and in the absence of a driving force , the characteristic first passage time scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the number of monomers .",
    "this result can not be reconciled with the equilibration time of a polymer which scales as @xmath6 , with a dynamic scaling exponent @xmath5 that is larger than 2 for rouse dynamics of self - avoiding chains .",
    "clearly , we expect the constraint of passage through a hole to slow down rather than speed up the dynamics of the polymer , conceivably leading to an exponent even larger than @xmath5 .",
    "previous work recognizes this difficulty ; for example , ref.@xcite while using the brownian particle analogy , clearly explains why it is applicable to the pre - asymptotic region of interest in that paper . in this work",
    "we consider the true asymptotic scaling of the translocation time for large @xmath0 , and find that its scaling is similar to the corresponding equilibration time , albeit with a larger prefactor . since we can not rely on the brownian particle picture in this regime , we reach this conclusion by numerical simulations .    the problem is to calculate the time required for a polymer to move from one side of a rigid wall to the other through a narrow hole .",
    "this is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ transloc ] , with the space on both sides of the wall being infinite .",
    "although frequently a driving force , such as an external field or chemical potential difference is present in the problem , we shall restrict ourselves to a model without external forces . for translocation to occur , there must be two events .",
    "the first is the collective diffusion of the polymer to the vicinity of the pore ; the second is its threading through the pore . for a finite system , or in the presence of a finite concentration ,",
    "the first event takes a time determined by the concentration of polymers in solution , their diffusion constant , and the effective cross - section of the hole .",
    "this time is decoupled from the time for the second event , which is constrained by the passage of all monomers through the hole .",
    "since we are interested only in the latter event , we shall assume that in the initial state the first monomer of the polymer chain is already threaded through the hole .",
    "to avoid the situation in which the polymer withdraws from the hole and drifts away to infinity , we add the restriction that the first monomer is never allowed to cross back out of the hole .",
    "these constraints effectively isolate the translocation time from the time for the polymer to find the hole @xcite .    despite the conceptual simplicity of the translocation problem",
    ", it has been difficult to solve analytically .",
    "even the simplified case of a gaussian polymer in a one  dimensional space moving past a potential barrier is non  trivial@xcite .",
    "consequently , theoretical treatments resort to approximations such as reducing the problem to brownian dynamics of the translocation coordinate . as reviewed in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] , the focus of this approach is the probability density function @xmath7 that a particular monomer ( labeled by its sequential number @xmath8 along the chain ) is located at the hole at time @xmath9 .",
    "for such a constrained configuration , one can derive the entropy of the polymer if the segments on the two sides are in equilibrium .",
    "this entropy is then assumed to generate a force acting on the monomer , favoring its motion to one side or the other .",
    "naturally , stochastic forces are also present ( and are in fact necessary to push the chain over the entropic barrier ) .",
    "assuming that the translocation coordinate obeys brownian dynamics leads to a fokker - planck equation for the evolution of @xmath7 . the standard kramers approach to escape over a potential barrier yields a mean translocation time that scales with the number of monomers as @xmath2 ,",
    "i.e. the entropic barrier does not modify the diffusive scaling .",
    "we supplement this result with a numerical integration of the fokker - planck equation that yields the complete distribution function for transit times .",
    "the rouse model for the dynamics of a _ phantom chain _ also predicts a time of order of @xmath2 for the equilibration of the polymer .",
    "since such equilibration is essential to the use of the entropy function as the driving force , the internal consistency of the approach is in doubt .",
    "this is even more so when considering self - avoiding polymers , where the relaxation times are much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "noting this contradiction we proceed to numerical simulations in the rest of the paper .    in sec .",
    "[ sim1d ] we report on simulations of a phantom chain in one dimension . in this case",
    "the relaxation time of the chain scales as @xmath2 , and is thus not inconsistent with the predictions of the brownian particle analogy .",
    "we do indeed find that the probability density function for translocation times ( once appropriately scaled ) is quite similar to that obtained from solving the fokker ",
    "planck equation . however , the mean translocation time , while appearing to scale as @xmath2 , has a much larger prefactor , which depends on the size of the hole . in one dimension self - avoiding chains are fully stretched , and do not provide a fair model for translocation of a coiled polymer .",
    "two dimensional polymers as described in sec .",
    "[ sim2d ] , are ideal for studying the scaling of translocation times in a more complex situation .",
    "simulations are faster and easier than in three dimensions , while at the same time the effects of self - avoidance are more pronounced .",
    "our simulations for phantom chains reproduce the trends observed in one dimension , i.e. a mean translocation time scaling as @xmath2 with a larger prefactor . however , once self - avoidance is included the translocation times increase dramatically , the mean translocation time appearing to scale as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 which is the exponent for rouse relaxation of self - avoiding chains in two dimensions .",
    "we find that ( for the parameters of our model ) translocation times are roughly ten times longer than typical equilibration times .",
    "thus translocation is indeed much slower than diffusion of the polymer , but appears to scale with the same exponent .",
    "consequences of this observation are discussed in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the observed nontrivial scaling of translocation times is clear indication of the failure of the brownian picture for the dynamics of the translocation coordinate .",
    "instead , we suggest that the anomalous dynamics of a specified monomer in a chain provides a better analogy .",
    "following scaling arguments used for the latter , we predict anomalous behaviors for the translocation coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , fluctuations in @xmath8 are predicted to scale as @xmath13 , while in the presence of a chemical potential @xmath14 , the pulling velocity is predicted to behave as @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 for rouse dynamics in three dimensions .",
    "the reduction of the translocation problem to the brownian dynamics of a single coordinate was introduced in ref.@xcite , and further explored in ref.@xcite . here",
    "we review the main features of this approximation and its consequences .",
    "consider a polymer moving through a pore in a membrane , where the hole is so narrow that only a single strand of polymer can pass through .",
    "( thus , the parameter describing the width of the hole in fig .",

    "the progress of the polymer can be tracked by following the number @xmath8 of the monomer which is located in the hole at a particular time , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ transloc ] .",
    "let us denote the probability of monomer @xmath8 being in the hole at time @xmath9 by @xmath7 . as the monomer @xmath8 moves forward or backward through the hole a distance @xmath19 ( of order of the typical separation between monomers ) the relevant monomer number increases or decreases by unity .",
    "treating @xmath8 as a continuous variable , we can write a continuity equation for the probability as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the probability current .",
    "the central difficulty is to find an appropriate expression for @xmath22 which correctly reflects the correlated motion of the whole polymer .",
    "if the progress of the polymer is sufficiently slow for the segments on the two sides to come to equilibrium , the monomer at the hole experiences a mean force that can be obtained from the variations of a constrained free energy @xmath23 .",
    "how such a force can be used to deduce the dynamics of the monomer label is not clear .",
    "the analogy to brownian motion suggests that the rate of change of @xmath8 is related to the force by a mobility @xmath24 . since the polymer fluctuates back and forth between the two sides , there must also be a stochastic element which can be represented by a random force .",
    "if there are no correlations in this force at different times ( as in the standard langevin formulation for a brownian particle ) , there is a current that depends on the local probability density as @xmath25 where the diffusion parameter @xmath26 is proportional to the variance of the stochastic force@xcite . as in standard brownian processes",
    ", the above equation assumes that the mobility is related to the temperature @xmath27 by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "no similar restriction is made in ref.@xcite , which obtains the diffusion term from considerations of symmetry and locality . however , as elaborated in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , the assumption of locality need not be valid in this case , since the true dynamics of @xmath8 must reflect the collective behavior of the whole polymer .    calculating the restricted free energy @xmath23 is reasonably straightforward , and equivalent to finding the number of possible configurations of a polymer attached at one point to an impenetrable barrier .",

    "figure  [ potential ] depicts the resulting free energy for the case of @xmath36 .",
    "the two conditions are shown by two vertical lines on the sides of the graph : the line on the left ( infinite barrier ) signifies our assumption that the first monomer can never cross back through the hole , while the vertical line on the right ( @xmath37 ) represents the escape of a polymer which has crossed the barrier .",
    "the numbers of configurations of polymers in higher space dimensions @xmath38 , whether phantom or self - avoiding ( sa ) , can not be calculated exactly .",
    "however , it is known that they have the same dependence on the polymer length@xcite , with @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ freeen ] ) replaced by a number which depends on @xmath38 ( @xmath40 for phantom chains ) .",

    "( [ smol ] ) and ( [ jdef ] ) , we reduce polymer translocation to a standard single particle problem of escape over a potential barrier .",
    "it is interesting to note that if we rescale the variables according to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , all @xmath0 and @xmath26dependence is eliminated from the equation , resulting in @xmath43 the solution to this dimensionless equation can be converted back to real time by multiplying the @xmath9 axis by @xmath44 .",
    "thus , under the assumptions listed above , the escape time of a particle , and thus the translocation time of a polymer are proportional to @xmath44 . note , that this conclusion is _ independent _ of the value of the parameter @xmath39 , and remains valid even for a sa chain in which @xmath39 has a different value .",
    "the problem of escape from a _ deep _ well in one dimension was considered by kramers@xcite .",
    "assuming that the escape rate is slow , i.e. if at every moment in time the probability distribution of a particle in the well can be represented by an equilibrium ( boltzmann ) weight , kramers method enables an analytic calculation of the mean escape time . applying kramers formula to the logarithmic potential of the problem one finds@xcite ( for @xmath34 ) that the mean escape",

    "we thus obtain @xmath105 resulting in @xmath106 and @xmath107 for self - avoiding chains in two and three dimensions respectively ; i.e. in this case the fluctuations are _",
    "subdiffusive_. if we naively use the zimm exponent @xmath108 describing relaxation of polymers in hydrodynamic flows in @xmath38 dimensions , we obtain @xmath109 , while @xmath110 , i.e. the fluctuations are predicted to be _ superdiffusive _ in this case .",
    "the usual origin of the speed up of polymer dynamics in a fluid is attributable to the velocity flow field set up by the other monomers .",
    "it is doubtful that using the bulk zimm exponent remains valid for flows which must vanish in the vicinity of the wall .",
    "thus the above prediction of superdiffusive behavior should not be taken seriously prior to a proper analysis of the hydrodynamic correlations in the vicinity of the wall .",
    "it is experimentally hard to directly probe the motion of the translocation coordinate .",
    "the quantity that is easily measured in experiments@xcite is the distribution of the translocation times _ in the presence of a force _ introduced via a chemical potential difference @xmath14 for monomers on the two sides of the wall .",
    "while our results so far were in the absence of such a driving force , anomalous dynamics has consequences for the length dependence of the forced velocity .",
    "let us first recall the arguments for the drift velocity @xmath111 of a polymer in a force @xmath112 : scaling considerations suggest @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is a scaling function depending on the ratio of two quantities having dimensions of energy .",
    "the proportionality of the velocity to the force requires a linear scaling function , leading to a mobility @xmath115 . for rouse and zimm dynamics",
    "this leads to the well - known scalings of mobility as @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "similarly , for the pulling velocity @xmath118 of the translocation coordinate , scaling suggests @xmath119 . only for the case of diffusive dynamics of a phantom chain",
    "this velocity is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the anomalous slowdown due to rouse dynamics leads to a mobility that scales as @xmath120 in @xmath4 , and @xmath121 in @xmath122 .",
    "by contrast , hydrodynamic speeding up with zimm dynamic exponents leads to a mobility that grows as @xmath123 and @xmath124 in two and three dimensions respectively .",
    "once more , the latter results are not to be taken seriously without full hydrodynamic calculations in the presence of a wall .",
    "experiments so far@xcite do not indicate anomalous scaling , but the size range may not be sufficient to detect the rather small exponent .",
    "we conclude by listing two other avenues of potential exploration .",
    "the first is to note that the distribution of translocation times should also be modified by the anomalous dynamics , potentially to include power law tails that are distinct from the exponential tails in fig .",

    "<S> the results indicate that for large @xmath0 , translocation times scale in the same manner as diffusion times , but with a larger prefactor that depends on the size of the hole . such scaling implies anomalous dynamics for the translocation process . in particular , the fluctuations in the monomer number at the hole are predicted to be non - diffusive at short times , while the average pulling velocity of the polymer in the presence of a chemical potential difference is predicted to depend on @xmath0 .    2 </S>"
