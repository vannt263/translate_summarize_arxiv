    "it is an old goal in nonlinear time series analysis to infer the `` equations of motion from data series ''  @xcite . especially , for continuous flow systems modelling a sampled time series by a differential equation might allow for insight into the mechanisms at work by interpreting the resulting structure of the equation and values of the parameters .",
    "this is known as `` interpretability '' of a model  @xcite as opposed to black - box approaches like an attractor reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "the straightforward procedure to estimate the parameters in differential equations is to estimate time derivatives from the data and determine the parameters by a least - squares minimisation  @xcite .",
    "this approach is firstly limited by the additive observational noise which usually covers the observed dynamics and prohibits the reliable estimation of the derivatives  @xcite , especially if only one component of the multidimensional system can be measured .",
    "secondly , it is hampered by the huge number of possible nonlinear models that have to be compared .",
    "fortunately , there is often prior knowledge that gives constraints on the model or even suggests a specific type of model  @xcite .",
    "the validity of a specific model can be evaluated by comparing properties of simulated time series with the measured one  @xcite .",
    "this approach faces a dilemma . for the simulation the parameters have to be specified .",
    "thus , it is difficult to decide whether possible discrepancies between the properties of the simulated and the measured time series are caused by the fact that the chosen type or structure of model is wrong or by the circumstance that the parameters have been chosen inappropriately in the correct type of model , or both . in this paper",
    "we show that parametric modelling based on bock s multiple shooting algorithm  @xcite can solve this dilemma .",
    "if the model type is rejected we propose a search in structure space instead of parameter space . a search in structure space",
    "can be performed in two ways : fitting coefficients for certain basis functions ( e.g. coefficients of polynomials ) and nonparametrically .",
    "here we chose nonparametric modelling based on optimal transformations and maximal correlations @xcite as an exploratory tool to suggest a new type of model that again can be tested by parametric modelling .",
    "we explain and exemplify this strategy on a measured time series from a chaotic circuit  @xcite . in this application",
    "our strategy yields a reconstruction of the observed attractor of unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the paper is organized as followed : in the next section we briefly describe the two modelling procedures . for detailed discussions of the mathematical methods , proofs of convergence and numerical details ,",
    "see @xcite . in section [ sec_data ]",
    "we introduce the data and the model derived from prior knowledge for these data in  @xcite .",
    "the parametric modelling based on the suggested model , the search for a better model by a nonparametric procedure and the final parametric fit is presented in section [ results ] .",

    "the state vector @xmath3 is observed through a function @xmath4 and the observation @xmath5 is sampled at times @xmath6 and disturbed by white observational noise @xmath7 of standard deviation @xmath8 . in general , the observation function @xmath4 can also contain unknown parameters . in the following , for ease of clarity ,",
    "we assume the often met condition of a known , scalar observation function    [ obs_function ] g ( . ) = x_1(t_i ) which records one , for ease of notation the first , component of the dynamical state .",
    "a first approach to estimate the parameters without the need to estimate derivatives from the data is the _ initial value approach _ @xcite . for this procedure ,",
    "initial guesses for the parameters and the initial values @xmath9 are chosen .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ dyn_eq ] ) is solved numerically and estimates @xmath10 are calculated by eq .",

    "i=1^n    is minimized with respect to the parameters @xmath2 and the initial values @xmath9 by some numerical optimization algorithm  @xcite . for this procedure , the only information from the measured time series that enters the initial guesses of the optimization procedure is the value of the observed component , eq .",
    "( [ obs_function ] ) , at time @xmath11 .",
    "simulation studies have shown that , for many types of dynamics , this approach is numerically unstable by yielding a diverging trajectory or stopping in a local minimum  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that even for slightly wrong parameters , the trial trajectory looses contact to the measured trajectory .",
    "this is most evident in the case of chaotic dynamics , where due to the sensitivity with respect to initial conditions the numerical trial trajectory is expected to follow the measured trajectory of the system only for a limited amount of time .",
    "this divergence of the numerical and measured trajectory introduces many local minima in the landscape of the error functional , eq .",
    "( [ error_fcn ] ) .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by a multiple shooting algorithm introduced by bock  @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly explain this algorithm .",
    "the basic idea of the algorithm is to start the optimization with an only piecewise continuous trajectory that stays close to the data .",
    "if the observation function is @xmath12 , more information than only the first value of the measured time series as in the initial value approach can be used as initial guesses for the optimization procedure by the following strategy : the time interval @xmath13 $ ] of measurement is divided into numerous segments @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "a trial trajectory for each segment is calculated using the information @xmath15 from the measured time series and initial guesses for the remaining components of @xmath16 .",
    "the condition that the underlying trajectory is smooth enters into the algorithm by a constraint in the cost function , eq .",
    "( [ error_fcn ] ) .",
    "this constraint is nonlinear in the parameters but enters the optimization strategy using a gau - newton procedure only in a linearized way .",
    "therefore , the trajectory is allowed to be discontinuous at the beginning of the optimizing iterations but is forced to become smooth in the end .",
    "after convergence the algorithm also provides an estimate @xmath17 of the unobserved dynamical state .    for time series of chaotic systems it will , in general , not be possible to find a trajectory @xmath17 that shadows the true trajectory for arbitrary long times .",
    "furthermore , if the model is not correct , experience shows that a fit to the whole time interval @xmath13 $ ] of measurement often does not converge . for both reasons ,",
    "the time series is cut into pieces of equal length , and the parameters are fitted to all the pieces simultaneously .",
    "the length of these pieces is chosen as large as possible .",
    "we show the process of convergence for the time series under investigation in section [ resultsiii ] , fig .",
    "[ second_fit ] .",
    "analogous illustrative applications to simulated time series are given in  @xcite .",
    "note that after convergence the algorithm is identical to an initial value approach : it predicts the time series for each of the whole pieces based on the estimated initial values of the unobserved state vector .    after convergence confidence intervals for the parameters can be calculated from the curvature of the cost function  @xcite .",
    "note that both approaches do not need an attractor reconstruction by a delay embedding .",
    "thus , all problems associated with the delay reconstruction of a chaotic and noisy phase space , like finding an optimal embedding window and the `` curse of dimensionality , '' are of no or minor importance here .",
    "most importantly , we do not need such huge amounts of data as generally needed for a useful delay reconstruction and the method is also applicable to transient time series , see  @xcite .    by bock s multiple shooting algorithm the probability of stopping in local minima",
    "is reduced compared to the initial value approach .",
    "nonetheless , the algorithm should be applied with different initial guesses for the parameters and the unobserved components at times @xmath18 to yield confidence in the global optimality of the resulting estimates .",
    "optimal transformations and the associated concept of maximal correlation provide a nonparametric procedure to detect and determine nonlinear relationships in data sets .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote two zero - mean data sets and    r(x , y ) =    their ( normalized ) linear correlation coefficient , where @xmath21 $ ] is the expectation value .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is to find transformations @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that the absolute value of the correlation coefficient between the transformed variables is maximized .",

    "this is also true for the relation  ( [ thetaphi ] ) with @xmath26 .",
