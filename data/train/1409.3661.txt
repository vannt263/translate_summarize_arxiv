    "the spatial flatness and homogeneity of the present universe strongly suggest that a period of de sitter expansion or inflation had occurred in the early universe  @xcite . during inflation , quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field may give rise to energy density perturbations ( scalar modes )  @xcite , which can serve as the seeds for the formation of large - scale structures of the universe .",
    "in addition , a spectrum of gravitational waves ( tensor modes ) is produced from the de sitter vacuum  @xcite .    in the standard big bang cosmology ,",
    "scalar and tensor modes leave signatures on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) thoroughly determined by the power spectra , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath0 denote the temperature anisotropy , @xmath9-mode polarization , and @xmath0-mode polarization , respectively .",
    "cmb anisotropy and @xmath9-mode polarization have been well measured by wmap , _",
    "planck _ , and many other experiments  @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "unlike scalar modes , tensor modes are very weakly coupled to matter , so once produced they remain as a stochastic background until today .",
    "however , they induce large - scale cmb anisotropy via the sachs - wolfe effect and uniquely @xmath0-mode polarization .",
    "detecting these signals would provide a potentially important probe of the inflationary epoch and the latter is the primary goal of ongoing and future cmb experiments  @xcite .",
    "recently , wmap+spt cmb data has placed an upper limit on the contribution of tensor modes to the cmb anisotropy , in terms of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , which is @xmath10 at @xmath11 confidence level , tightening to @xmath2 when also including measurements of the hubble constant and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao )  @xcite .",
    "planck collaboration xvi has quoted @xmath2 using a combination of _ planck _ , spt , and act anisotropy data , plus wmap polarization  @xcite .",
    "more recently , bicep2 cmb experiment has found an excess of @xmath0-mode power at degree angular scales , indicating the presence of tensor modes with @xmath12 when assuming nearly scale - invariant tensor and scalar spectra  @xcite .",
    "if this result is confirmed , it would give a very strong support to inflation model and open a new window for probing the inflationary dynamics , though conflicting with the _ planck _ low @xmath3 limit .",
    "there have been many ideas trying to alleviate the tension on the high tensor - to - scalar ratio of bicep2 . here",
    "we will restrict ourself to those involving inflationary dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to accommodate relatively large tensor contribution in the cmb anisotropy by suppressing the large - scale scalar spectrum with a transient fast - roll phase or sound - speed variation of inflaton fluctuations in a slow - roll inflation , or by anti - correlating the tensor and scalar modes for power cancellation .",
    "recently , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite considered the effect on density perturbation due to a quantum environment that interacts with inflaton .",
    "it was shown that the quantum environment constitutes a colored noise that induces inflaton fluctuations , resulting in a suppression of the scalar spectrum at large - scales .",
    "this suppressed scalar power spectrum was then used to explain the observed low quadrupole in the cmb anisotropy . on the other hand ,",
    "tensor modes generated during inflation are also affected by the quantum environment but only through gravitational interaction , so the effect is suppressed by the planck mass and the tensor modes remain nearly intact . in light of this , we will show that by the same token an interacting inflaton could alleviate the tension between _ planck _ and bicep2 data .",
    "motivated by various theoretical reasons or cosmological observations , there has been a lot of interest in inflation models with an interacting inflaton such as reheating , preheating , or trapping phenomenon , in which the inflaton is coupled to scalar , fermion , or vector fields . here",
    "we will not restrict ourselves to a specific inflation model , but rather assuming a successful inflation potential that satisfies the standard slow - roll condition .",
    "furthermore , we introduce an interaction between the inflaton and scalar fields as a simple working example to show the occurrence of a colored noise due to the interaction during inflation and to study its effect on inflaton fluctuations .",
    "there are many studies on the effects of particle production during inflation , though in different contexts , deriving similar inflaton perturbation equations that exhibit both noise and dissipation effects  @xcite .",
    "the colored noise stems from the quantum interaction of the inflaton , @xmath13 , and other fields such as a scalar , @xmath14 , while the inflaton is rolling down the potential @xmath15 .",
    "the lagrangian of this kind of model usually takes the following form  ( see , for examples , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath16,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is a coupling constant and @xmath18 is a constant field value . for a single @xmath14 field and @xmath19",
    ", it reduces to the simplest case in which a massive scalar couples to the inflaton  @xcite . in the case with many copies of @xmath20 fields and @xmath21 ,",
    "when @xmath13 rolls down to a trapping point @xmath18 , @xmath20 particles become instantaneously massless and are copiously produced , and then backreact on the motion of the inflaton  @xcite . in either case , it has been shown that particle number density fluctuations ( or the noise term ) in the @xmath20 particle production would induce a blue power spectrum of the inflaton fluctuations .",
    "below we will give a brief review of this phenomenum .",
    "for the purpose of showing the generation of the blue power spectrum , we consider the simplest interaction in a small - field inflation model that has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath22    we can approximate the background metric to be de  sitter during inflation which is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 with the hubble parameter @xmath25 and inflation begins at @xmath26 .",

    "note that the dissipation in the equation is not important at the beginning of inflation because it is a time accumulated term .",
    "we may safely neglect it if we only consider the first few efolds of inflation .",

    "the latter condition limits the growth of @xmath66 during inflation to be less than about @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "( [ sigmaeq ] ) does not include mass corrections to @xmath68 from the mean inflaton field , @xmath69 , and the mass renormalization due to quantum fluctuations of the inflaton , @xmath70 . under the slow - roll condition ,",
    "@xmath39 grows linearly as @xmath71  @xcite and thus @xmath72 after about @xmath73 efoldings ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath75 for the period during which those @xmath76 modes of cosmologically relevant scales cross out the horizon , we can conveniently choose @xmath77 ( i.e. , @xmath78 ) for which @xmath14 takes a very simple form .",
    "after then , @xmath79 may grow to a value much bigger than @xmath80 and thus the effective mass of @xmath14 becomes much larger than @xmath80 .",
    "if so , this large mass will suppress the growth of @xmath66  @xcite and may diminish the effect of the noise term .",

    "the figure shows that the noise - driven fluctuations depend on the onset time of inflation and approach asymptotically to a scale - invariant power spectrum @xmath99 at large @xmath76 . here",
    ", the mean field value @xmath96 should be naturally of order @xmath25 in small - field inflation .",
    "in large - field inflation model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the obtained noise - driven power spectrum is also blue and there @xmath100 can be the spacing between the trapping points along the inflaton trajectory .",
    "let us go back to examine the dissipation term in the langevin equation  ( [ lange ] ) . as mentioned above",
    ", the dissipation is a time accumulated effect . near the beginning of inflation , by doing integration by parts of this term , it was found  @xcite that this term only contributes a mass correction of about @xmath101 to @xmath102 , a small friction term of order @xmath103 to eq .",
    "( [ lange ] ) , and a correction to the slope of the inflaton potential @xmath104 of order @xmath105 .",
    "all of these corrections can be neglected as long as @xmath106 .",
    "one should emphasize that the white noise  ( [ wnoise ] ) causes a delta - function response and thus produces a scale - invariant spectrum of inflaton quantum fluctuations , whereas the colored noise  ( [ noise ] ) has a causal response due to an interaction between the inflaton and the quantum environment .",
    "the latter gives rise to a suppressed power spectrum at cosmologically relevant scales as long as inflation lasts for just about @xmath73 efoldings .",
    "although the exact form of the colored noise varies with the type of interaction , the blue - tilted power spectrum is just a consequence of the causal response .",
    "this characteristic feature in the power spectrum should be quite general ; it exists whenever there is interaction between the inflaton and any other quantum fields .",
    "here assuming a slow - roll inflation , the scalar power spectrum contains both inflaton quantum fluctutations and that driven by the colored noise , given by @xmath107 where the noise contribution is quantified by a parameter @xmath108 the power spectrum of the inflaton quantum fluctutations is given by the scale - invariant @xmath40 , and @xmath109 is the scalar power spectrum in the _ planck _ best - fit lambda cold dark model ( @xmath88cdm )  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ ps ] , we will need to specify the duration of inflation in order to determine the value of @xmath98 that corresponds to a given comoving scale . in the following , instead of fixing the duration of inflaton",
    ", we will treat the value of @xmath98 that corresponds to @xmath110mpc@xmath111 as a free parameter denoted by @xmath112 .    on the the hand , in order to fit bicep2 data of the @xmath113 power spectrum , we prepare a scale - invariant tensor power spectrum in the @xmath88cdm model , @xmath114 , such that the @xmath3 ratio , @xmath115 at @xmath116mpc@xmath111 . recently , _ planck _",
    "polarization data  @xcite has implied that the bicep2 b - mode signal may contain contributions from polarized dust emission , so the ratio @xmath3 may be reduced significantly . in light of this , we also study the case when @xmath117 , in which we repeat every step as in the case with @xmath1 except using @xmath117 tensor power spectrum .    then using @xmath118 and",
    "@xmath119 we compute cmb @xmath120 and @xmath113 power spectra , based on the cmbfast code  @xcite .",
    "we tune the values of @xmath121 and @xmath112 , by fixing the other cosmological parameters to the best - fit values of the _ planck _",
    "@xmath88cdm model  @xcite , to best fit the _ planck _ and bicep2 data .",
    "for the case with @xmath1 , the likelihood plot in fig .",
    "[ contour ] shows the maximum likelihood values of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "[ total ] shows that the @xmath120 power spectrum with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which is induced by a combination of both @xmath118 and @xmath119 , is indeed the same as that induced only by @xmath109 within measurement errors .",
    "the large - scale @xmath120 power suppression due to the colored noise can be really made up by the tensor contribution .",
    "if @xmath100 is assumed , then @xmath122 would imply that @xmath124 .",
    "for the case with @xmath117 , we find that the results are very similar to those for @xmath1 except that the value of @xmath121 is now reduced to about @xmath125 .",
    "interestingly , recent studies based on bayesian statistics have indicated that the _ planck _ and bicep2 joint likelihood analysis strongly favors a scalar power spectrum like that one in fig .",
    "[ ps ]  @xcite .",
    "because inflaton has to be interacting with other fields so as to convert its potential energy into radiation to reheat the universe , the interaction may induce a large - scale power suppression in the cmb temperature anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "we have shown that the presence of a significant amount of tensor modes as indicated in the bicep2 measurement of the cmb @xmath0-mode polarization would lift up this temperature suppression .",
    "this implies that the measured temperature anisotropy power spectrum made by the _",
    "team can be a combination of scalar and @xmath1 tensor contributions .",
    "if bicep2 results are confirmed to be genuine tensor @xmath0 modes , our work would indicate that we may have one - sigma detection of the interacting inflation model .",
    "on the other hand , if bicep2 b - mode signal is mostly polarized dust contamination and @xmath3 is thus reduced significantly , this would put a tighter upper bound on the interaction strength .",
    "lastly , we admit that the duration of inflation in the present work must be assumed to be about @xmath73 efoldings such that the power suppression takes place just at the large scales of the universe .                    c. r. contaldi , m. peloso , and l. sorbo , arxiv:1403.4596 ; v. miranda , w. hu , and p. adshead , arxiv:1403.5231 ; s. choudhury and a. mazumdar , arxiv:1403.5549 ; m. kawasaki and s. yokoyama , arxiv:1403.5823 ; a. ashoorioon , k. dimopoulos , m. m. sheikh - jabbari , and g. shiu , arxiv:1403.6099 ; j .- q .",
