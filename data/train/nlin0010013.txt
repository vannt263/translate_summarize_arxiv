    "it consists of an @xmath5-site network , where each site is connected to @xmath6 randomly chosen sites .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is known as the _ connectivity _ of the network .",

    "the @xmath6 connections and the evolution rule of each site are chosen at the beginning and kept fixed during the evolution .",
    "thus , the disorder is quenched and the dynamics is deterministic . for a finite number of sites @xmath5 , the number of states in phase space is also finite  it equals @xmath22 .",
    "then , for any initial condition , the system will eventually fall into a cycle .    in the @xmath23 parameter space , kauffman networks present phases of frozen and chaotic evolution , separated by a critical line .",
    "the transition between these phases has been extensively studied , and characterized by means of several order parameters , such as the hamming distance @xcite and the stable core size @xcite . in most of this work",
    "we will deal with the case @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which lies within the chaotic phase .",
    "the annealed model ( am ) was introduced to study the evolution of overlaps between states in kns @xcite . in this model , the @xmath6 connections @xmath26 of each site as well as the boolean functions @xmath15 are randomly changed at each time step .",

    "the asymptotic periodic behavior of kns is absent in the annealed model .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it allows for analytical calculations , and it has been shown that its predictions are in good agreement with the behavior of kns in the limit @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "suppose that we have two identical kns with the same connections and rules .",
    "we feed them with different initial conditions , and let them evolve in time .",
    "we define the _ overlap _ @xmath28 between the networks as the fraction of homologous sites that are in the same state at time @xmath29 . in the am , it is possible to calculate the time evolution of the overlap . at time",

    "thus , there is a fraction @xmath31 of homologous sites whose state will coincide at @xmath30 .",
    "the remaining @xmath32 sites still have a probability of overlapping .",

    "in order to establish a coupling mechanism between two kns , we first observe that , due to the discrete nature of kns , the usual deterministic coupling used for maps @xcite can not be applied here .",

    "the coupling mechanism defined above is symmetric , since each network may influence the other .",
    "it could also be possible to consider a biased , non symmetric coupling , in which one network drives the other @xcite .    for @xmath58",
    "the two networks are uncoupled , and evolve independently from each other . for @xmath59 , in contrast , the networks synchronize completely at the first time step . from then on ,",
    "they follow a common trajectory in phase space without further intervention of the coupling mechanism .",

    "were no damage spreading takes place , an arbitrary small coupling intensity @xmath61 leads eventually to synchronization .",
    "the situation is different in the chaotic phase .",
    "there , we find two competing driving forces acting on the coupled system , namely , the chaotic dynamics which induces the separation between two trajectories to grow @xcite , and the coupling , by which the hamming distance between the networks decreases . in this paper",
    ", we focus attention on the chaotic phase .",
    "the annealed model can be used to predict the behavior of the pair of coupled kns .",
    "we recall that the time evolution equation for the hamming distance in the case of two _ free _ networks is given by eq .",
    "( [ dda ] ) .",
    "now suppose that the hamming distance of two _ coupled _ kns at time @xmath29 is @xmath62 .",
    "the first substep in the dynamics of this system consists of the free evolution of both networks .",

    "coupling acts on the system , and a fraction @xmath43 of the homologous sites that were in different states are assigned the same value .",
    "this leaves a fraction @xmath64 of sites with different states in the two networks .",
    "thus , the evolution of the hamming distance for coupled networks is given by the map @xmath65= \\varphi ( p , q ) \\left ( 1- \\left [ 1- d(t ) \\right]^k \\right ) , \\label{ddac}\\ ] ] with @xmath66 .",

    "we have recorded the time evolution of the hamming distance , performing averages over @xmath84 realizations of @xmath5-site networks .",

    "the am result gives a good description for the case of @xmath97 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath62 on the size of the system can be partially ascribed to the effect of _ spurious synchronization_. because of the discrete nature of kns , two finite - size networks can be brought to the same state by a fluctuation caused by the stochastic coupling .",
    "in such case , the two networks will remain synchronized from then on .",
    "this event is more frequent for small networks , where the relative size of fluctuations increases . near the critical point , furthermore , where the hamming distance vanishes asymptotically , the effect of fluctuations is strongly enhanced .",
    "the net result of spurious synchronization is that the effective critical coupling for finite - size networks shifts to lower values as @xmath5 decreases . as a consequence ,",
    "the average hamming distance in our simulations may vanish even for coupling probabilities below @xmath73 , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ dt1 ] and [ dt2 ] .",
    "spurious synchronization can be avoided by adding noise to the system .",

    "that noise eliminates spurious synchronization for @xmath68 , but also prevents the kns to exactly synchronize even for @xmath72 .",

    "the ansatz ( [ gamma ] ) is therefore supported by numerical results .",
    "note that these conclusions are independent of the strength of coupling , measured by the probability @xmath43 , since the only effect of the coupling dynamics in connection with the above analysis is to change the set of asymptotic states @xmath129 and the profile of the distribution @xmath147 .",
    "according to the results reported in the previous sections , the synchronization transition of stochastically coupled kns on the one hand , and of stochastically coupled elementary cellular automata ( eca , @xcite ) on the other , are qualitatively different .",
    "namely , they belong to different universality classes . whereas we have found that synchronization in kns appears through a transcritical bifurcation  with a critical exponent equal to unity for the asymptotic hamming distance  the corresponding transition in eca has been shown to exhibit nontrivial exponents @xcite , which seem to suggest that it belongs to the universality class of directed percolation @xcite .",
    "it is therefore relevant to study a third class of systems , intermediate between eca and generic kns .    in a generic kn",
    "there are two sources of disorder .",
    "we have the network topology , determined by the random choice of connections , and the local evolution rules , which are also chosen at random . on the other hand , in cellular automata both the topology and the dynamical rules are fully homogeneous .",

    "we refer to these networks as disordered cellular automata ( dca ) .",
    "we focus here on the elementary rule @xmath159 , which exhibits chaotic evolution @xcite .",
    "this rule is defined by the boolean function @xmath160 and @xmath161 for the remaining five possible neighborhoods ( see table [ rule22 ] ) .",

    "in particular , the dynamics at some sites may be governed by nonchaotic rules , giving rise to sensible differences in the global behavior .",

    "as before , these deviations may be attributed to finite - size effects .",
    "finally , as an interpolation between dca and eca we consider partially ordered topologies ( poca ) , constructed in the following way .",
    "we start with an @xmath5-site eca , which consists of a one - dimensional array where each site is connected to itself and to its two nearest neighbors .",
    "then , for each site , each neighbor is redrawn at random from the whole network with probability @xmath180 . with the complementary probability , @xmath181 ,",
    "the neighbor is preserved .",
    "the resulting topological structure of connections is analogous to that of small - world networks @xcite .",
    "for @xmath182 , we recover the dca networks discussed above .",
    "results of numerical simulations on poca with rule @xmath159 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figdca ] for @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "data for eca with rule @xmath159 ( @xmath185 ) are also shown .",
    "we see that , in spite of the relatively low values of @xmath180 , the asymptotic hamming distance of poca depends on the coupling probability @xmath43 in a way qualitatively similar to that of kns . in particular , it does not exhibit the abrupt dependence on @xmath43 observed in eca near the critical point",
    ". this would be in agreement with the crossover scenario in small - world networks @xcite , where it is known that even small amounts of disorder induce behaviors which already resemble that of fully random structures .",
    "we have studied the behavior of two kauffman networks interacting through a form of symmetric stochastic coupling . as for many other localized or extended , random or deterministic , coupled dynamical systems @xcite , we have found that coupled kauffman networks can synchronize their evolution if coupling is strong enough . in our case",
    ", there is a critical value of the coupling probability @xmath43 beyond which the two networks converge to the same trajectory as time elapses .",
    "in contrast with the situation encountered for other extended systems @xcite , however , for kauffman networks it has been possible to give an analytical description of the synchronization transition , in excellent agreement with numerical results for large - size systems .",
    "this formulation is provided by an extension of the so - called annealed model @xcite to the system of coupled networks .",
    "the model gives the evolution of the overlap between the two networks  or , in other words , of their hamming distance  and makes it possible to evaluate its asymptotic value .",
    "the asymptotic hamming distance @xmath74 is used as an order parameter for the synchronization transition . for",
    "coupled kauffman networks in the chaotic phase , the annealed model predicts the existence of a critical coupling probability @xmath73 , such that @xmath74 is finite for @xmath68 and vanishes for @xmath72 . at the critical point , @xmath186 , and",
    "the transition has the character of a transcritical bifurcation .",
    "the transition predicted by the annealed model is qualitatively different from that observed in the deterministic version of this kind of systems , more specifically , in cellular automata . for elementary cellular automata , in fact ,",
    "the critical behavior of the hamming distance exhibits nontrivial exponents @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that , at least for some evolution rules , the synchronization transition in cellular automata belongs to the class of directed percolation @xcite . on the other hand , by analogy with the problem of damage spreading , synchronization in kauffman networks",
    "could belong to the class of directed percolation in disordered systems @xcite .",
    "results from extensive numerical simulations of relatively large networks ( @xmath96 sites ) , performed for kauffman networks in the chaotic regime ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , are in good agreement with the predictions of the annealed model both in the temporal evolution and in the asymptotic behavior of the system . however , for small networks some systematic departures from the analytical results are apparent . these deviations can be partially explained taking into account the occasional events of spurious synchronization for @xmath68 , due to the effect of suitably large fluctuations on our discrete finite - size system . the effect of these fluctuations becomes more important as the coupling probability approaches its critical value . in any case , spurious synchronization can be successfully eliminated by adding a small amount of noise to the dynamics .",
    "moreover , noise can also be encompassed into the annealed model .",
    "we have introduced noise in the simulations and observed that remanent finite - size effects persist .",
    "these must now be ascribed to the failure of the annealed model in describing finite networks . by means of a more detailed statistical description of the overlaps between networks , in fact",
    ", we have been able to account for such remanent effects , also explaining the dependence of the deviation from the annealed model on the network size .",
    "finally , we have presented preliminary numerical results on disordered and partially ordered stochastically coupled cellular automata .",
    "these systems can be seen as providing a kind of interpolation between kauffman networks , with their completely random connections and dynamical rules , and cellular automata , which are fully ordered . in the case of disordered networks with the same evolution rule on all the sites ,",
    "it is possible to extend the annealed model , which predicts the same class of synchronization transition as for kauffman networks .",
    "numerical simulations agree with these predictions . increasing the order in the connections by means of a scheme analogous to the construction of a small - world network @xcite , we have also considered partially disordered structures . even for small amounts of structural disorder ,",
    "the behavior associated with the synchronization transition seems to resemble that of kauffman networks more than that of cellular automata .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that the synchronization transition of partially disordered automata is in the same universality class as for coupled kauffman networks",
    ". nevertheless , further extensive simulations and a careful determination of the critical exponents are necessary to draw any conclusions on this point .",
    "this work has been partially carried out at the abdus salam centre for theoretical physics ( trieste , italy ) .",
    "the authors thank the centre for hospitality .",
    "in this appendix we illustrate the computation of the coefficients @xmath171 in eq .",
    "( [ am - dnur ] ) with an explicit example .",
    "we recall that @xmath171 is defined as the probability for two homologous sites having all but @xmath169 inputs coming from homologous sites in the same state to give the same output .",
    "let us assume that the frequency with which a given neighborhood appears in a state of the whole network is fully determined by the density @xmath187 of the state .",
    "namely , we neglect the correlations between neighborhood frequencies , associated with the spatial patterns generated by the dynamics . for @xmath25",
    ", there are eight possible neighborhoods , which we label from @xmath11 to @xmath188 as shown in table [ rule22 ] . within the above assumption , the frequency @xmath189 of each neighborhood",
    "@xmath18 can be estimated in terms of the density @xmath187 as @xmath190 moreover , we note that the density @xmath187 can in turn be written in terms of the frequencies @xmath189 of neighborhoods with nonzero output . for rule @xmath159",
    "these neighborhoods are @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 ( see table [ rule22 ] ) , so that we have @xmath194 combining eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) yields @xmath195 , which agrees with the numerical measurement reported in sect . [ dca ] .",
    "the corresponding values of the frequencies @xmath189 are shown in table [ rule22 ] .",
    "they are in very good agreement with the values obtained from numerical simulations , also shown in the table .",
    "this supports our above assumption of uncorrelated neighborhood frequencies .",
    "once the frequencies @xmath189 are known , we are able to calculate the coefficients @xmath171 . as a specific example , we discuss @xmath196 . by definition , this is the probability for two homologous sites having all but @xmath197 inputs coming from homologous sites in the same state to give the same output .",
    "thus , we are in the case where the two neighborhoods have all the homologous sites in different states .",
    "the pairs of neighborhoods that satisfy this condition are @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 . among them , however , only the pair @xmath198 has the same output for both neighborhoods ( see table [ rule22 ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath196 is therefore given by @xmath202 the computation of the other coefficients is accomplished in a similar way , yielding @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "moreover , @xmath205 .                                                          .",
