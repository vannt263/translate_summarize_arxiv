    "the computation of the gluon and ghost propagators of pure yang - mills theory in the landau gauge have been investigated in the past years using lattice simulations for the su(2 ) and su(3 ) groups and accessing deeper the infrared region . in four dimensions ,",
    "this effort established a consensus that the gluon propagator  @xcite is infrared suppressed and acquires a finite non - vanishing value at zero momentum . on the other hand , the ghost propagator seems to be described essentially by its tree level expression  @xcite . in order to access the infrared momenta ,",
    "the lattice simulations have been performed on huge volumes : ( 27 fm)@xmath4 using a @xmath0 lattice for the su(2 ) gauge group  @xcite and ( 17 fm)@xmath4 using a @xmath8 lattice for su(3 ) . such large volumes were achieved by setting the lattice spacing at @xmath9 fm . although the simulations were performed within the perturbative scaling window , the use of such large lattice spacings rise the question of how far from the continuum limit the results are .    for pure yang - mills theory",
    "the mass scale is given by the mass of the lightest glueball state .",
    "for su(3 ) , lattice simulations  @xcite show that the lightest glueball has the quantum numbers @xmath10 and a mass of about @xmath11 mev . the distance scale associated with such a value for the mass being @xmath12 fm .",
    "for the su(2 ) gauge group  @xcite , the predicted lightest glueball is about @xmath13 mev and the corresponding distance scale is given again by @xmath14 fm .",
    "it follows , that the large lattice spacings used in the simulation mentioned in the previous paragraph can introduce some bias on the final result .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite , the dependence of the gluon propagator on the lattice spacing for the su(3 ) gauge group was analysed .",
    "the authors conclude that not only the effects due to the use of a large lattice spacing are dominant , over the finite volume effects , but also that the computations using such a large lattice spacing underestimates the propagator in the infrared region .",
    "however , at the qualitative level the results of  @xcite reproduce the large volume / large lattice spacing simulations reported in  @xcite .    in the current paper , we aim to extend the work of  @xcite and investigate the dependence of the gluon and ghost propagators on the lattice spacing for large physical volumes @xmath15 fm .",
    "furthermore , given that from the gluon and ghost propagator one can define a renormalisation group invariant strong coupling constant @xmath6 , we also analyse the dependence of the coupling on the lattice spacing .",
    "our results show that the use of a large lattice spacing changes the deep infrared values of the gluon propagator , of the ghost propagator and of the strong coupling constant .",
    "the simulations reported here show that the gluon propagator is suppressed in the infrared region , when one uses a large lattice spacing , while the ghost propagator is enhanced by using a larger lattice spacing . on the other hand , for the definition of the strong coupling constant considered here",

    "the dressing function decreases as the physical volume of the lattice increases .",
    "this type of behaviour with the volume is not observed in our simulations where we used smaller lattice spacings . indeed , as resumed in fig .",

    "the differences between the two sets of simulations are clearly seen for @xmath17 gev , with the estimations of  @xcite being smaller than those obtained in our simulations .",

    "in this work we report the dependence of the lattice results for the gluon propagator , the ghost propagator and the strong coupling constant on the physical volume and lattice spacing used to simulate qcd .",
    "our goal is to understand how precise one can compute these functions using lattice qcd simulations , modulo possible effects associated with the presence of gribov copies .",
    "in fact , the issue of the gribov copies can be important to the calculation of the propagators and , possibly , the strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "however , due to the huge amount of computer time needed to study gribov copies effects in these large lattices , we are unable to disentangle such influence in our lattice results .",
    "nevertheless , the observed dependence of the above mentioned functions on the lattice spacing and physical volume is , as demonstrated by the results discussed here and  @xcite , far from trivial and impact mainly in the low momentum region .    in what concerns the gluon propagator",
    "the new simulations reproduce the behaviour already observed in  @xcite .",
    "the lattice data show essentially no dependence on the lattice physical volume for volumes above ( 6.5 fm)@xmath4 for the full range of momenta accessed . on the other hand",
    ", the infrared propagator reveals a non trivial dependence on the lattice spacing , with smaller lattice spacings favouring larger infrared propagators for momenta smaller than @xmath31 gev .    on the other hand",
    ", the ghost propagator has a mild dependence on the lattice volume but , contrary to the gluon propagator , the simulations show that this two point correlation function is suppressed at low momenta when the lattice spacing is decreased .",
    "we would like to point out that , for the ghost propagator , the functional form ( [ eq : fitrenghost ] ) which reproduces the perturbative one - loop result at high momentum is able to describe the lattice data over a surprisingly wide range of momenta . indeed ,",
    "if one takes @xmath44 as fitting parameter , ( [ eq : fitrenghost ] ) is able to fit the lattice data from momenta @xmath7 gev up to the largest momenta simulated .",
    "if one sets @xmath45 mev , the range of momenta described by ( [ eq : fitrenghost ] ) starts from about @xmath46 gev and goes , again , up to the largest momentum available .",
    "we take this result as an indication that the ghost propagator follows closely the perturbative propagator for momenta as small as @xmath7 gev .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : gluon_prop_4gev ] and  [ fig : ghost_dressing_4gev ] one can quantify how the propagators are modified by changing the lattice spacing .",
    "for the gluon propagator one finds , for zero momentum , a @xmath47 order of magnitude effect by decreasing the lattice spacing from 0.18 fm down to 0.06 fm . in what concerns the ghost propagator , the change of the lattice spacing changes the propagator by @xmath48 at the lower momenta available in our simulations .",
    "the dependence of the strong coupling constant on the lattice spacing and physical volume is milder than for the propagators .",
    "although the position of the maximum of @xmath6 seems to be independent of the both the lattice spacing and volume , the value of the strong coupling constant seems to be suppressed as one approaches the continuum limit . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : coupling ] , the value of @xmath6 at the maximum is reduced by @xmath49 for our largest value , when compared to the other calculations .    in sec . [",
    "sec : compbma ] our results are compared with those obtained using the largest physical volumes to simulate pure yang - mills su(3 ) theory  @xcite .",
    "such large volumes were achieved by relying on a large lattice spacing @xmath50 fm .",
    "our simulations and those performed by the berlin - moscow - adelaide group give different answers for all the quantities considered here at low momenta .",
    "note , however , that at the qualitatively level the propagators and the strong coupling constant are similar .",
    "furthermore , looking at the renormalized data , see figs .",
    "[ fig : gluon_prop_4gev ] for the gluon and fig .",
    "[ fig : glue_prop_berlin_renormalised ] for the ghost data , both sets of propagators show no dependence or a very mild one on the physical volume .",
    "the differences that are seen in the infrared for the two sets of simulations may be explained by different choices of the gauge fixing algorithm , i.e. in principle it can be attributed to gribov noise .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the choice of the maxima of @xmath51 $ ] can change the propagators in the low momenta region .",
    "a direct comparison of the berlin - moscow - adelaide simulations and ours for @xmath50 fm , suggests that the continuum gluon ( ghost ) propagator should be suppressed ( enhanced ) at low momenta .    in summary ,",
    "our results show that the computation of the two point correlation functions on the lattice has a non - trivial dependence on the lattice spacing and a mild dependence on the lattice volume for volumes above ( 6.5 fm)@xmath4 .",
    "simulations performed with large lattice spacings , i.e. @xmath52 fm for pure yang - mills theory , are able to get the qualitative features of the propagators but introduce a measurable bias on the results at low momenta .",
    "the use of such large lattice spacings introduce also strong lattice spacing effects for all momenta range , not show here , which are removed for momenta above @xmath7 gev by performing cuts on the momenta  @xcite .",
    "all the simulations discussed here use the wilson action ; certainly , improving the action may ameliorate the results in what concerns the dependence on the lattice spacing .",
    "however , relying on improved actions requires revising all the calculation procedure .",
