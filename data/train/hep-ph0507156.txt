    "in this decade , there are continuing huge experimental efforts to explore the quark - flavour sector of the standard model ( sm ) : babar ( slac ) and belle ( kek ) have already collected @xmath3 @xmath4 pairs , first @xmath0-physics results are coming from run ii of the tevatron ( fnal ) , second generation @xmath0-decay studies will start at the lhc ( cern ) in 2007 , and there are various plans to measure rare kaon decays . in this programme ,",
    "the @xmath0-meson system is a particularly interesting playground , with challenging aspects of strong interactions , avenues to obtain valuable insights into weak interactions , and probes to search for  new physics \" ( np ) ; for a detailed recent discussion , see ref .  .",
    "a key rle is played by non - leptonic @xmath0 decays , which may receive contributions from tree , qcd penguin and electroweak ( ew ) penguin topologies . in order to deal with these processes ,",
    "low - energy effective hamiltonians are used , which are calculated by means of the operator product expansion , yielding transition amplitudes of the following structure:@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is fermi s constant , @xmath7 a factor containing the corresponding elements of the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , and @xmath8 denotes a renormalization scale .",
    "the @xmath9 are local operators , which are generated through the interplay between electroweak interactions and qcd , and govern `` effectively '' the decay in question , whereas the wilson coefficients @xmath10 describe the scale - dependent  couplings \" of the interaction vertices that are associated with the @xmath9 . in this formalism",
    ", the short - distance contributions are described by the perturbatively calculable wilson coefficients @xmath11 , whereas the long - distance physics arises in the form of hadronic matrix elements @xmath12 .",
    "these non - perturbative quantities are the key problem in the theoretical analyses of non - leptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "although there were interesting recent developments in this field through qcd factorization ( qcdf),@xcite the perturbative hard - scattering ( pqcd ) approach,@xcite soft collinear effective theory ( scet),@xcite and qcd light - cone sum - rule methods,@xcite as discussed at this conference in the plenary talks by beneke , cheng , du and bauer , the @xmath0-factory data indicate that the theoretical challenge remains ( see , for instance , refs .   ) .",
    "fortunately , it is possible to circumvent the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements for the exploration of cp violation :    * amplitude relations can be used to eliminate the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "we distinguish between exact relations , using pure `` tree '' decays of the kind @xmath13 or @xmath14 , and relations , which follow from the flavour symmetries of strong interactions , and involve @xmath15 modes . * in the neutral @xmath16 systems ( @xmath17 ) , the interference between @xmath18@xmath19 mixing and decay processes may lead to `` mixing - induced cp violation '' . if a single ckm amplitude dominates the decay , the hadronic matrix elements cancel in the corresponding cp asymmeties ; otherwise we have to use amplitude relations again .",
    "these two avenues offer various strategies to  overconstrain \" the unitarity triangle ( ut ) of the ckm matrix through studies of cp violation in the @xmath0 system.@xcite moreover ,  rare \" decays , which originate from loop processes in the sm , provide valuable complementary information ; important examples are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 transitions . in the presence of np effects in the quark - flavour sector",
    ", we expect to encounter discrepancies with the picture emerging from the ckm mechanism .",
    "popular ways for np to manifest itself are the following :    * _ @xmath18@xmath19 mixing : _ np may enter through the exchange of new particles in box diagrams , which contribute in the sm , or through new contributions at the tree level , thereby modifying the mixing parameters as follows : @xmath24 whereas the np contribution @xmath25 to the mass difference would affect the determination of one ut side , the np contribution @xmath26 to the weak mixing phase would enter the mixing - induced cp asymmetries . because of the remarkable agreement between the direct determination of the ut angle @xmath27 through @xmath28 and the ckm fits,@xcite the space for np is getting smaller and smaller in the @xmath29 system . on the other hand , the @xmath30 system is still essentially unexplored , and will be a key target for lhcb . *",
    "_ decay amplitudes : _ np has typically a small effect if sm tree processes play the dominant rle , as in @xmath28 . on the other hand , we encounter potentially large effects in the flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) sector .",
    "for instance , new particles may enter in penguin diagrams , or new fcnc processes may arise at the tree level .",
    "interestingly , there are hints in the current @xmath0-factory data for such effects . in particular , belle results",
    "for @xmath31 raise the question of whether @xmath32 , and the branching ratios of certain @xmath33 decays show a puzzling pattern .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on the latter ",
    "@xmath33 puzzle \" , which was already indicated by the first cleo data for the @xmath34 decay in 2000,@xcite and received a lot of attention recently ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "puzzle , as discussed in the text . ]",
    "in order to analyse the puzzling patterns in the @xmath33 data , we use the strategy in three subsequent steps developed in ref .  , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : chart ] ; the numerical values refer to the recent update given in ref .  .",
    "the @xmath35 system offers three decay channels , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as well as their cp conjugates .",
    "consequently , we may introduce the following two independent ratios of the corresponding cp - averaged branching ratios : @xmath39\\frac{\\tau_{b^0_d}}{\\tau_{b^+ } } , \\quad r_{00}^{\\pi\\pi}\\equiv2\\left[\\frac{\\mbox{br}(b_d\\to\\pi^0\\pi^0)}{\\mbox{br } ( b_d\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-)}\\right].\\ ] ] the branching ratios for @xmath40 and @xmath41 are found to be surprisingly small and large , respectively , whereas the one for @xmath42 is in accordance with theoretical estimates .",
    "this feature is the  @xmath35 puzzle \" .",
    "in addition to the cp - conserving observables in ( [ r - pipi ] ) , we may also exploit the following cp - violating observables of the @xmath40 decay : @xmath43 the experimental picture of these cp asymmetries is not yet fully settled.@xcite however , their theoretical interpretation discussed below yields constraints for the ut , in excellent agreement with the ckm fits obtained within the sm .    using the isospin flavour symmetry of strong interactions , the observables in ( [ r - pipi ] ) and ( [ acp - pipi ] ) depend on two ( complex ) hadronic parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which describe  sloppily speaking  the ratio of penguin to colour - allowed tree amplitudes and the ratio of colour - suppressed to colour - allowed tree amplitudes , respectively .",
    "it is possible to extract these quantities _ cleanly _ and _ unambiguously _ from the data : @xmath46 a similar picture is also found by other authors.@xcite@xmath47@xcite in particular the impressive strong phases give an unambiguous signal for large deviations from  factorization \" . in recent qcdf@xcite and pqcd@xcite analyses ,",
    "the following numbers were obtained : @xmath48 @xmath49 which depart significantly from the experimental pattern in ( [ bpipi - par - det ] ) .",
    "having the hadronic parameters given in ( [ bpipi - par - det ] ) at hand , the cp - violating asymmetries of the @xmath41 channel can be predicted : @xmath50 offering the exciting perspective of large cp violation in this decay .",
    "the first results for the direct cp asymmetry were recently reported by the babar and belle collaborations,@xcite corresponding to the average of @xmath51,@xcite which is in encouraging agreement with ( [ adir00-pred ] ) . in the future , more accurate input data will allow us to make much more stringent predictions .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath35 modes , which originate from @xmath52 processes , we have to deal with @xmath53 transitions in the case of the @xmath33 system .",
    "consequently , these decay classes differ in their ckm structure and exhibit a different dynamics .",
    "in particular , the @xmath33 decays are dominated by qcd penguins . concerning the ew penguins , we distinguish between the following cases : in @xmath54 , @xmath55 transitions , the ew penguin amplitudes are colour - suppressed and are hence expected to be tiny . on the other hand , ew penguins contribute also in colour - allowed form to the @xmath56 , @xmath57 system and have therefore a significant impact on these modes .",
    "the starting point of our @xmath33 analysis is given by the hadronic parameters determined in subsection  [ ssec : bpipi - puzzle ] and the ckm fits of the ut , which are only insignificantly affected by ew penguins .",
    "we then use the following working hypotheses :    * @xmath58 flavour symmetry of strong interactions ; * neglect of penguin annihilation and exchange topologies",
    ".    internal consistency checks of these assumptions can be performed .",
    "they are nicely satisfied by the current data , and do not indicate any anomalous behaviour .",
    "we may then determine the hadronic @xmath33 parameters through their @xmath35 counterparts , allowing us to predict the @xmath33 observables in the sm .    in the case of the observables with a tiny impact of ew penguins , we obtain agreement between the sm predictions and the data . in particular , our prediction @xmath59 agrees nicely with the measurements of this direct cp asymmetry , which was observed by babar and belle in the summer of 2004,@xcite with the average value @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) listed above imply @xmath61}_{\\mbox{0.38$\\pm$0.04}}= \\underbrace{-\\left[\\frac{{a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}(b_d\\to\\pi^\\mp   k^\\pm)}{{a}_{\\rm cp}^{\\rm dir}(b_d\\to\\pi^+\\pi^- ) } \\right]}_{\\mbox{0.31$\\pm$0.11}}.\\ ] ] the experimental numbers indicated in this expression give us further confidence in our working hypothesis .",
    "furthermore , @xmath62 allows us to convert the @xmath40 cp asymmetries into a value of @xmath63 , in excellent agreement with the fits for the ut . on the other hand , a moderate numerical discrepancy arises for the ratio @xmath64 of the cp - averaged @xmath65 , @xmath66 branching ratios .",
    "this feature suggests a sizeable impact of a hadronic parameter , @xmath67 , which enters the most general parametrization of the @xmath55 amplitude . it can be constrained through the direct cp asymmetry of the decay @xmath66 and the emerging @xmath68 signal , and actually shifts the predicted value of @xmath64 towards the data .",
    "let us now turn to those observables that are significantly affected by ew penguins .",
    "the key quantities are the following ratios:@xcite @xmath69\\stackrel{\\rm exp}{=}1.00\\pm0.08\\ ] ] @xmath70\\stackrel{\\rm exp}{=}0.79\\pm0.08,\\ ] ] where the ew penguin contributions enter in colour - allowed form through the decays with @xmath71 mesons in the final states .",
    "theoretically , the ew penguin effects are described by the following parameters : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , which can be calculated in the sm with the help of the @xmath58 flavour symmetry,@xcite measures the `` strength '' of the ew penguins with respect to the tree contributions , and @xmath74 is a cp - violating weak phase with an origin lying beyond the sm .",
    "ew penguin topologies offer an interesting avenue for np to manifest itself , as has already been known for several years.@xcite    @xmath75 plane , as discussed in the text . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnrc - update ] , we show the current situation in the @xmath76@xmath75 plane : the experimental ranges and those predicted in the sm are indicated in grey,@xcite and the dashed lines serve as a reminder of the corresponding ranges in ref .  ;",
    "the central values for the sm prediction have hardly moved , while their uncertainties have been reduced a bit .",
    "moreover , we show contours for values of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with @xmath80 $ ] . we observe that we arrive no longer at a nice agreement between our sm predictions and the experimental values .",
    "however , as becomes obvious from the contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnrc - update ] , this discrepancy can be resolved if we allow for np in the ew penguin sector , i.e.  if we keep @xmath73 and @xmath74 as free parameters .",
    "following these lines , the successful picture described above would not be disturbed , and we obtain full agreement between the theoretical values of @xmath81 and the data .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 are given as follows : @xmath82 where in particular the large cp - violating phase would be a striking signal of np .",
    "these parameters then allow us to predict also the cp - violating observables of the @xmath83 and @xmath84 decays,@xcite which should provide useful future tests of this scenario . particularly promising in this respect",
    "are rare @xmath2 and @xmath0 decays .      in order to explore the implications for rare @xmath2 and @xmath0 decays , we assume that np enters the ew penguin sector through enhanced @xmath85 penguins with a new cp - violating phase .",
    "this scenario was already considered in the literature , where model - independent analyses and studies within susy were presented.@xcite in our strategy , we determine the short - distance function @xmath86 characterizing the @xmath85 penguins through the @xmath33 data . performing a renormalization - group analysis,@xcite we obtain @xmath87.\\ ] ] if we then evaluate the relevant box - diagram contributions within the sm and use ( [ rg ] ) , we can calculate the short - distance functions : @xmath88 which govern the rare @xmath2 , @xmath0 decays with @xmath89 and @xmath90 in the final states , respectively . in the sm , we have @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , with _ vanishing _",
    "cp - violating phases .",
    "if we impose constraints from the data for rare decays , in particular those on @xmath94 following from @xmath95 , the following picture arises : @xmath96 the corresponding predictions of @xmath75 and @xmath76 agree nicely with the data reported at the ichep 04 conference.@xcite we may encounter significant deviations from the sm expectations for certain rare decays , with a pattern characteristic of our np scenario .",
    "the most spectacular effects are the following ones:@xcite    * @xmath23 : enhancement of @xmath97 by up to one order of magnitude , and strong violation of the relation @xmath98 . * @xmath99 and @xmath100 : now governed by direct cp violation , with branching ratios enhanced by @xmath101 .",
    "* @xmath102 : a forward  backward cp asymmetry can be very large .",
    "* @xmath103 and @xmath22 : branching ratios may be enhanced by factors as large as @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath35 data allow the clean extraction of hadronic parameters , which indicate large non - factorizable effects  thereby resolving the  @xmath35 puzzle \"  and favour large cp violation in @xmath41 .",
    "the resulting sm analysis of the @xmath33 system agrees with the current data , with the _ exception _ of the observables receiving sizeable ew penguin contributions , which is another manifestation of the  @xmath33 puzzle \" .",
    "it can be resolved through np in the ew penguin sector involving a large cp - violating phase .",
    "if np enters through @xmath85 penguins , we expect significant np effects in rare @xmath2 and @xmath0 decays , with a pattern that is characteristic of this scenario",
    ". it will be interesting to confront these results with future , more accurate data .",
