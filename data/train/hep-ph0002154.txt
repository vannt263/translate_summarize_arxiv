    "the axion was postulated nearly two decades ago @xcite to explain why the strong interactions conserve @xmath4 and @xmath5 in spite of the fact that the weak interactions violate those symmetries .",
    "consider the lagrangian of qcd : @xmath6 + { \\theta g^2\\over 32\\pi^2 } g^a_{\\mu\\nu } \\tilde g^{a\\mu\\nu } ~~\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term is a 4-divergence and hence does not contribute in perturbation theory .",
    "that term does however contribute through non - perturbative effects @xcite associated with qcd instantons @xcite .",
    "such effects can make the physics of qcd depend upon the value of @xmath7 . using the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly @xcite",
    ", one can show that @xmath7 dependence must be present if none of the current quark masses vanishes .",
    "indeed otherwise qcd would have a @xmath8 symmetry and would predict the mass of the @xmath9 pseudo - scalar meson to be less than @xmath10  mev @xcite , contrary to observation . using the anomaly",
    ", one can further show that qcd depends upon @xmath7 only through the combination of parameters : @xmath11 if @xmath12 , qcd violates @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the absence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 violations in the strong interactions therefore places an upper limit upon @xmath13 .",
    "the best constraint follows from the experimental bound @xcite on the neutron electric dipole moment which yields : @xmath14 .",
    "the question then is : why is @xmath13 so small ? in the standard model of particle interactions , the quark masses originate in the electroweak sector which violates @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "there is no reason why the overall phase of the quark mass matrix should exactly match the value of @xmath7 from the qcd sector to yield @xmath15 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath5 violation is introduced in the manner of kobayashi and maskawa @xcite , the yukawa couplings that give masses to the quarks are arbitrary complex numbers and hence arg  det  @xmath16 and @xmath13 are expected to be of order one .    the problem why @xmath14 is usually referred to as the `` strong @xmath5 problem '' .",
    "the existence of an axion solves this problem in a simple manner which is rich in implications for experiment , for astrophysics and for cosmology .",
    "there are two alternative solutions however .",
    "the first alternative is to set @xmath17 .",
    "this removes the @xmath7-dependence of qcd and thus solves the strong @xmath5 problem .",
    "the well - known calculation of the pseudo - scalar meson masses in lowest order of chiral perturbation theory yields @xmath18 mev , which is incompatible with @xmath17 .",
    "this calculation also predicts the successful gell - mann - okubo relation among the pseudo - scalar masses squared .",
    "it is possible to have @xmath17 by invoking second order effects @xcite .",
    "this a reasonable proposition because @xmath19 happens to be of order the qcd scale .",
    "however , when second order effects are included @xcite , the gell - mann - okubo relation is in general violated .",
    "thus the price for having @xmath17 through higher order effects is that the gell - mann - okubo relation becomes an accident .",
    "the second alternative solution to the strong cp problem is to assume that @xmath5 and/or @xmath4 is spontaneously broken but is otherwise a good symmetry . in this case",
    ", @xmath13 is calculable and may be arranged to be small @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is worth emphasizing that the strong @xmath5 problem need not be solved in the low energy theory . indeed , as ellis and gaillard @xcite pointed out , if in the standard model @xmath20 near the planck scale then @xmath21 at the qcd scale .",
    "peccei and quinn @xcite proposed to solve the strong @xmath5 problem by postulating the existence of a global @xmath22 quasi - symmetry .",
    "@xmath22 must be a symmetry of the theory at the classical ( i.e. , at the lagrangian ) level , it must be broken explicitly by those non - perturbative effects that make the physics of qcd depend upon @xmath7 , and finally it must be spontaneously broken .",
    "the axion @xcite is the quasi - nambu - goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath22 .",
    "one can show that , if a @xmath22 quasi - symmetry is present , then @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the axion field and @xmath25 is called the axion decay constant .",
    "@xmath26 is the vacuum expectation value which spontaneously breaks @xmath22 and @xmath27 is an integer which expresses the color anomaly of @xmath22 .",
    "axion models have @xmath27 degenerate vacua @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative effects that make qcd depend upon @xmath13 produce an effective potential @xmath28 whose minimum is at @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite  thus , by postulating an axion , @xmath13 is allowed to relax to zero dynamically and the strong @xmath5 problem is solved .",
    "the properties of the axion can be derived using the methods of current algebra @xcite .",
    "the axion mass is given in terms of @xmath30 by @xmath31 all the axion couplings are inversely proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "of particular interest here is the axion coupling to two photons : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath35 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath36 is a model - dependent coefficient of order one .",
    "@xmath37 in the dfsz model @xcite whereas @xmath38 in the ksvz model @xcite .",
    "the coupling of the axion to a spin 1/2 fermion @xmath39 has the form : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a model - dependent coefficient of order one . in the ksvz model",
    "the coupling to electrons is zero at tree level .",
    "models with this property are called hadronic.",
    "the searches for the axion in high energy and nuclear physics experiments are discussed in the reviews by kim @xcite and by peccei @xcite .",
    "a complete list of experiments can be found in the review of particle physics @xcite .",
    "if the axion is heavier than 1 mev and decays quickly into @xmath42 ( lifetime of order @xmath43 sec or less ) , then it is ruled out by negative searches for rare particle decays such as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the rate of this reaction follows simply from the mixing of @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the known decay @xmath47 , and hence it is almost completely model - independent @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the axion is long lived ( @xmath43 sec or more ) . in this case",
    "it is severely constrained by negative searches in beam dumps . in a beam dump , axions are produced by many different processes involving independent couplings , such as @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 mixing , the axion couplings to two photons and to two gluons , and the couplings to quarks and gluons .",
    "it is difficult to calculate these processes with precision at all energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the many processes add up incoherently and they can not all vanish",
    ". thus one can give a reliable estimate for the total production ( @xmath51 , or @xmath52 ) and interaction ( @xmath53 ) cross - sections .",
    "many such searches @xcite have been carried out .",
    "they rule out axions with mass larger than about 50 kev .",
    "the astrophysical contraints on the axion are described in detail in the reviews by turner @xcite and raffelt @xcite .",
    "axions are emitted by stars in a variety of processes such as compton - like scattering ( @xmath54 ) , axion bremstrahlung ( @xmath55 ) and the primakoff process ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the rate at which a star burns its nuclear fuel is limited by the rate at which it can loose the energy produced .",
    "emission of light weakly coupled bosons , such as the axion , allows a star to radiate energy efficiently because such particles can escape the star at once ( without rescattering ) whereas photons are emitted only from the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "thus the existence of an axion accelerates stellar evolution , which may be inconsistent with observation .",
    "the longevity of red giants rules out the mass range 200 kev @xmath57 ev @xcite for hadronic axions . above 200 kev",
    "the axion is too heavy to be copiously emitted in the thermal processes taking in red giants , whereas below 0.5 ev it is too weakly coupled . for axions with a large coupling to electrons [ @xmath58 in eq .",
    "[ cf ] ] the ruled out range can be extended to 200 kev @xmath59 ev because axion emission through the compton - like process @xmath54 cools the helium core to such an extent as to prevent the onset of helium burning @xcite .",
    "finally the range 2 ev @xmath60 ev is ruled out by supernova 1987a @xcite .",
    "the constraint follows from the fact that the duration of the associated neutrino events in the large underground proton decay detectors @xcite is consistent with theoretical expectations based on the premise that the collapsed supernova core cools by emission of neutrinos .",
    "if the axion mass is in the above - mentioned range , the core cools instead by axion emission and the neutrino burst is excessively shorthened .",
    "the supernova constraint is quite axion model - independent because the axions are emitted by axion bremstrahlung in nucleon - nucleon scattering ( @xmath61 ) and the relevant couplings follow simply from the mixing of the axion with the @xmath46 which is a general feature of axion models .",
    "when the limits from laboratory searches are combined with the astrophysical contraints , all of the axion mass range down to approximately @xmath62 ev is ruled out .",
    "the implications of the existence of an axion for the history of the early universe may be briefly described as follows . at a temperature of order @xmath26",
    ", a phase transition occurs in which the @xmath22 symmetry becomes spontaneously broken .",
    "this is called the pq phase transition . at these temperatures , the non - perturbative qcd effects which produce the effective potential @xmath28",
    "are suppressed @xcite , the axion is massless and all values of @xmath63 are equally likely .",
    "axion strings appear as topological defects .",
    "one must distinguish two cases : 1 ) inflation occurs with reheat temperature higher than the pq transition temperature ( equivalently , for our purposes , inflation does not occur at all ) or 2 ) inflation occurs with reheat temperature less than the pq transition temperature . in case 2",
    "the axion field gets homogenized by inflation and the axion strings are blown away .",
    "when the temperature approaches the qcd scale , the potential @xmath28 turns on and the axion acquires mass .",
    "there is a critical time , defined by @xmath64 , when the axion field starts to oscillate in response to the turn - on of the axion mass .",
    "the corresponding temperature @xmath65 gev @xcite .",
    "the initial amplitude of this oscillation corresponds to how far from zero the axion field is when the axion mass turns on .",
    "the axion field oscillations do not dissipate into other forms of energy and hence contribute to the cosmological energy density today @xcite .",
    "this contribution is called of ` vacuum realignment ' .",
    "it is further described below .",
    "note that the vacuum realignment contribution may be accidentally suppressed in case 2 because the homogenized axion field happens to lie close to zero .    in case 1",
    "the axion strings radiate axions @xcite from the time of the pq transition till @xmath66 when the axion mass turns on . at @xmath66",
    "each string becomes the boundary of @xmath27 domain walls .",
    "if @xmath67 , the network of walls bounded by strings is unstable @xcite and decays away . if @xmath68 there is a domain wall problem @xcite because axion domain walls end up dominating the energy density , resulting in a universe very different from the one observed today .",
    "there is a way to avoid this problem by introducing an interaction which slightly lowers one of the @xmath27 vacua with respect to the others . in that case ,",
    "the lowest vacuum takes over after some time and the domain walls disappear .",
    "there is little room in parameter space for that to happen and we will not consider this possibility further here . a detailed discussion is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . henceforth , we assume @xmath67 .    in case 1",
    "there are three contributions to the axion cosmological energy density .",
    "one contribution @xcite is from axions that were radiated by axion strings before @xmath66 .",
    "a second contribution is from axions that were produced in the decay of walls bounded by strings after @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "a third contribution is from vacuum realignment @xcite .",
    "let me briefly indicate how the vacuum alignment contribution is evaluated . before time @xmath66",
    ", the axion field did not oscillate even once .",
    "soon after @xmath66 , the axion mass is assumed to change sufficiently slowly that the total number of axions in the oscillations of the axion field is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "the number density of axions at time @xmath66 is @xmath69 where @xmath30 is the axion decay constant introduced earlier . in eq .",
    "( [ nat1 ] ) , we used the fact that the axion field @xmath24 is approximately homogeneous on the horizon scale @xmath66 .",
    "wiggles in @xmath24 which entered the horizon long before @xmath66 have been red - shifted away @xcite .",
    "we also used the fact that the initial departure of @xmath24 from the nearest minimum is of order @xmath30 .",
    "the axions of eq .",
    "( [ nat1 ] ) are decoupled and non - relativistic .",
    "assuming that the ratio of the axion number density to the entropy density is constant from time @xmath66 till today , one finds @xcite @xmath70 for the ratio of the axion energy density to the critical density for closing the universe .",
    "@xmath71 is the present hubble rate in units of 100 km / s.mpc .",
    "the requirement that axions do not overclose the universe implies the constraint @xmath72   ev .",
    "the contribution from axion string decay has been debated over the years .",
    "the main issue is the energy spectrum of axions radiated by axion strings .",
    "battye and shellard @xcite have carried out computer simulations of bent strings ( i.e. of wiggles on otherwise straight strings ) and have concluded that the contribution from string decay is approximately ten times larger than that from vacuum realignment , implying a bound on the axion mass approximately then times more severe , say @xmath73 instead of @xmath74 .",
    "my collaborators and i have done simulations of bent strings @xcite , of circular string loops @xcite and non - circular string loops @xcite . we conclude that the string decay contribution is of the same order of magnitude than that from vacuum realignment .",
    "recently , yamaguchi , kawasaki and yokoyama @xcite have done computer simulations of a network of strings in an expanding universe , and concluded that the contribution from string decay is approximately three times that of vacuum realignment . the contribution from wall decay has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "it is probably subdominant compared to the vacuum realignment and string decay constributions .",
    "it should be emphasized that there are many sources of uncertainty in the cosmological axion energy density aside from the uncertainty about the constribution from string decay .",
    "the axion energy density may be diluted by the entropy release from heavy particles which decouple before the qcd epoch but decay afterwards @xcite , or by the entropy release associated with a first order qcd phase transition . on the other hand ,",
    "if the qcd phase transition is first order @xcite , an abrupt change of the axion mass at the transition may increase @xmath75 .",
    "if inflation occurs with reheat temperature less than @xmath76 , there may be an accidental suppression of @xmath75 because the homogenized axion field happens to lie close to a @xmath5 conserving minimum .",
    "because the rhs of eq .",
    "( 7 ) is multiplied in this case by a factor of order the square of the initial vacuum misalignment angle @xmath77 which is randomly chosen between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the probability that @xmath75 is suppressed by a factor @xmath80 is of order @xmath81 .",
    "this rule can not be extended to arbitrarily small @xmath80 however because quantum mechanical fluctuations in the axion field during the epoch of inflation do not allow the suppression to be perfect @xcite .",
    "the axions produced when the axion mass turns on during the qcd phase transition are cold dark matter ( cdm ) because they are non - relativistic from the moment of their first appearance at 1  gev temperature .",
    "studies of large scale    structure formation support the view that the dominant fraction of dark matter is cdm .",
    "any form of cdm necessarily contributes to galactic halos by falling into the gravitational wells of galaxies .",
    "hence , there is excellent motivation to look for axions as constituent particles of our galactic halo .",
    "finally , let s mention that there is a particular kind of clumpiness @xcite which affects axion dark matter if there is no inflation after the peccei - quinn phase transition .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dark matter axions are inhomogeneous with @xmath82 over the horizon scale at temperature @xmath83 1 gev , when they are produced at the start of the qcd phase - transition , combined with the fact that their velocities are so small that they do not erase these inhomogeneities by free - streaming before the time @xmath84 of equality between the matter and radiation energy densities when matter perturbations can start to grow .",
    "these particular inhomogeneities in the axion dark matter are in the non - linear regime immediately after time @xmath84 and thus form clumps , called ` axion mini - clusters ' @xcite .",
    "they have mass @xmath85 and size @xmath86 cm .    the various constraints on the axion , from accelerator seaches , astrophysics and cosmology are summarized in fig .",
    "an electromagnetic cavity permeated by a strong static magnetic field can be used to detect galactic halo axions @xcite .",
    "the relevant coupling is given in eq .",
    "galactic halo axions have velocities @xmath87 of order @xmath88 and hence their energies @xmath89 have a spread of order @xmath90 above the axion mass . when the frequency @xmath91 of a cavity mode equals @xmath1 , galactic halo axions convert resonantly into quanta of excitation ( photons ) of that cavity mode . the power from axion @xmath92 photon conversion on resonance",
    "is found to be @xcite : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the volume of the cavity , @xmath95 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath96 is its loaded quality factor , @xmath97 is the ` quality factor ' of the galactic halo axion signal ( i.e. the ratio of their energy to their energy spread ) , @xmath98 is the density of galactic halo axions on earth , and @xmath99 is a mode dependent form factor given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the static magnetic field , @xmath102 is the oscillating electric field and @xmath103 is the dielectric constant .    because the axion mass is only known in order of magnitude at best , the cavity must be tunable and a large range of frequencies must be explored seeking a signal .",
    "the cavity can be tuned by moving a dielectric rod or metal post inside it . using eq .",
    "( 8) , one finds the scanning rate to perform a search with signal to noise ratio @xmath104 : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the sum of the physical temperature of the cavity plus the electronic noise temperature of the microwave receiver that detects the photons from @xmath107 conversion .",

    "11 ) shows that a galactic halo search with the required sensitivity is feasible with presently available technology , provided the form factor @xmath99 can be kept at values of order one for a wide range of frequencies . for a cylindrical cavity and a homogeneous longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath110 for the lowest tm mode .",
    "the form factors of the other modes are much smaller .",
    "the resonant frequency of the lowest tm mode of a cylindrical cavity is @xmath39=115 mhz @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the radius of the cavity . since @xmath113 ( 242 mhz ) ,",
    "a large cylindrical cavity is convenient for searching the low frequency end of the range of interest . to extend the search to high frequencies without sacrifice in volume , one may power - combine many identical cavities which fill up the available volume inside a magnet s bore @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to maintain @xmath114 at high frequencies , albeit at the cost of increasing engineering complexity as the number of cavities increases .",
    "pilot experiments were carried out at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite and at the university of florida @xcite .",
    "these experiments used relatively small magnets and hence the limits they placed on the local axion dark matter density are not severe .",

    "second generation experiments are presently under way at lawrence livermore national laboratory ( llnl ) @xcite and at kyoto university @xcite .",

    "since then , the frequency range 500 - 800 mhz ( @xmath119ev ) has been searched but the results have not been published yet . up till now , the experiment has used a single cavity with a variety of dielectric rods and metal posts . however",

    "must be installed to cancel the static magnetic field at the location of the squid .",

    "the kyoto experiment exploits resonant @xmath124 conversion in a cavity permeated by a large static magnetic field , as do the other experiments , but uses a beam of rydberg atoms to count the photons from @xmath124 conversion @xcite .",

    "the flux of solar axions on earth is @xmath126 from the primakoff conversion of thermal photons in the sun @xcite .",
    "the actual flux may be larger because other processes , such as compton - like scattering , contribute if the axion has an appreciable coupling to the electron . at any rate the flux is huge compared to what can be produced by man - made processes on earth and it is cost free .",
    "solar axions have a broad spectrum of energies of order the temperature in the solar core , from one to a few kev .    since the magnetic field is homogeneous on the length scale set by the axion de broglie wavelength , the final photon is colinear with the initial axion .",

    "the polarization rotation and the birefringence effects were searched for by the rbf collaboration @xcite , which boosted these effects by passing the laser beam hundreds of times in an optical cavity within the magnet . for more recent work ,",
    "@xcite .",
    "the axion decays to two photons at the rate : @xmath146 for axions in the 10 ev mass range , the decay rate is comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "the dominant contribution to the cosmological energy density of such axions is thermal production @xcite .",
    "the energy density in thermal axions is proportional to the axion mass and becomes equal to the critical energy density at a mass of order 100 ev , the exact value depending on how many particle species annihilate after the axion decoupled .",
    "one can search for relic axions by looking for the monochromatic photons from their decay .",
    "such photons arrive to us from all directions but preferentially from large agglomerations of mass , such as clusters of galaxies .",
    "the relative width @xmath147 of the photon line from axion decay in galactic clusters is of order the virial velocity there , i.e @xmath148 . by subtracting the spectrum of light from a galactic cluster from that of the nightsky off cluster",
    ", one can subtract some of the background .",
    "the latter is dominated by lines in the spectrum of airglow @xcite .",
    "a search of this type was carried out at kitt peak national laboratory by the tsar collaboration @xcite .",
    "they placed the limit @xmath149 in the range @xmath150 ev ( 3100 - 8300  ) .",
    "j. moody and f. wilczek @xcite analyzed the apparent deviations from the @xmath151 gravitational force law due to the exchange of virtual axions .",
    "the coupling of the axion to a spin 1/2 fermion @xmath39 has the general form : @xmath152 when allowance is made for the fact that cp is violated in the electroweak interactions .",
    "@xmath41 is of order one , whereas @xmath153 is of order @xmath154 , which is of order @xmath155 @xcite in the standard model . the second term in eq . ( [ cpv ] )",
    "produces a coupling of the axion field to the mass density of a macroscopic collection of non - relativisitc fermions , whereas the first term produces a coupling of the axion field to the spin density of that macroscopic body .",
    "the first type of coupling was called monopole , the second dipole. the axion mediated forces between two macroscopic bodies therefore fall into three categories : monopole - monopole , monopole - dipole , and dipole - dipole .",
    "the monopole - monopole force is suppressed by two powers of @xmath153 and therefore very small .",
    "the dipole - dipole force has a very large background from ordinary magnetic forces .",
    "this background can be suppressed by using superconducting shields but not well enough for the axion mediated contribution to be detected .",
    "the monopole - dipole is the least difficult to detect .",
    "it is suppressed by only one factor of @xmath153 and it can be modulated by rotating the spin polarized body .",
    "experiments of this type have been carried out @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , their sensitivity is many orders of magnitude short of what is required to see the effect .",
