    "cometary globules are believed to be molecular cloud condensations , which are so dense that they are not disrupted when an region expands into the molecular cloud(s ) surrounding it .",
    "such globules are always bright rimmed and often have a cometary or tear shaped form , because the stellar wind and ionizing radiation from the central o stars ablate away the low density gas on the side facing the o stars and sweep away dust towards the tail .",
    "cometary globules are thought to form from `` elephant trunks '' @xcite , although for compact cores surrounded by low density gas this phase can be quite short .",
    "the rosette nebula is a good example of an region , which shows an abundance of both cometary globules and elephant trunk structures @xcite .",
    "although elephant trunks and cometary globules have been known for a long time , the fact that these sites may be forming stars was realized only in the last few decades . the first clear confirmation that stars form in cometary globules was a result of the identification of bernes  135 in the cometary globule cg1 , one of the large cometary globules in the gum nebula , as a pre - main - sequence ( pms ) star @xcite .",
    "the discovery of molecular outflows associated with cold iras sources without optical counterparts in three bright - rimmed globules @xcite , definitely confirmed that stars form in elephant trunks and cometary globules .",
    "probably the most well - known example of star forming in the tip of elephant trunks is seen in the hubble poster , `` the pillars of creation '' , in the eagle nebula ( m16 ) @xcite .    in this paper we examine star formation in a more nearby cometary globule , ori i-2 , located in the large region ic434 .",
    "this is one of the three globules , in which @xcite discovered a molecular outflow . by using _",
    "irac and mips images , 2mass data , deep r and h@xmath1 images from the nordic optical telescope ( not ) , and scuba sub - millimeter imaging we can identify all young stars in and near the globule and provide more accurate information on their physical characteristics .",
    "@xcite were the first to notice this globule in the large region ic434 and named it orii-2 .",
    "the region ic434 is illuminated by the trapezium like system @xmath3  ori with at least five early type stars @xcite .",
    "the two hottest members , a and b ( o9.5v and b0.5v ) form a binary system , which allows for an accurate distance determination .",
    "@xcite derived a distance of 334 pc assuming that they form a binary , although he also considered the possibility that it is a hierarchical triple system , in which case the distance would be @xmath4 385 pc .",
    "@xcite , in their review of distance estimates to the @xmath3 orionis cluster , quote a slightly larger distance , 420 @xmath5 30 pc .",
    "the morphology of orii-2 , with the bright rim facing @xmath3  ori and the tail aligned in the direction of the star suggests that the globule is at the same distance or slightly in front of @xmath3  ori . in this paper",
    "we adopt the distance to orii-2 as 380 pc , favoring the distance estimate by @xcite .",
    "@xcite included orii-2 in their molecular line survey of small bok globules and found it to be the densest , the most compact , and the warmest , 18  k , of all the globules in their sample .",
    "@xcite discovered a bipolar molecular outflow in the globule .",
    "they found that the outflow had a linear extent of 0.34 pc , a dynamical age of 5 @xmath2 10@xmath6 yr , and was centered on a low luminosity ( l = 11 ) cold iras source , iras  @xmath7 , without any optical counterpart .",
    "@xcite did a more detailed study of orii-2 in co , @xmath8co and c@xmath9o j = @xmath10 , hcn j = @xmath11 , cs j = @xmath12 and cs j = @xmath13 with higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they confirmed that the molecular outflow is bipolar and centered on the iras source , iras  @xmath7 , but found it to be more compact ( 0.22  pc ) than what @xcite estimated from their low - spatial resolution observations . by examining the palomar sky survey prints and doing ccd imaging in r , i , and narrowband h@xmath1 and [ ]",
    ", they showed that the bright rim is a diffuse region and not a reflection nebula .",
    "they identified a faint star , star a , as a possible counterpart to the iras source .",
    "they found that the gas temperature of the shock heated gas in the bright rim is @xmath4 25 k , while the gas temperature in the opaque ( a@xmath14 @xmath4 20@xmath15 ) core of the globule is @xmath4 12 k , similar to that of normal isolated globules .",
    "they determined the total mass of the globule to be @xmath4 8 , with the opaque core having a mass of @xmath4 2.3  ( corrected to a distance of 380 pc ) .",
    "orii-2 was included in the catalogue of remnant molecular clouds in the ori ob1 association by @xcite as cloud number 40a .",
    "they also identified three fainter cometary globules `` behind '' the tail of orii-2 ( 40a ) , which they called 40b , c , and d. @xcite , who did a photographic and ccd imaging survey of the l  1630 and l  1641 molecular cloud regions in orion , identified a chain of hh objects , hh289 , to the east of ori i-2 and a tube like feature ( cavity ) protruding out on the western side of the globule , both apparently excited by the embedded iras source .",
    "their observations show that the iras source drives a giant outflow with a projected size of @xmath16  pc to the east .",
    "a good overview of orii-2 and other globules in the vicinity of @xmath3 orionis can be found in @xcite .",
    "we have extracted irac and mips ( 24 & 70  ) observations from the spitzer space observatory archive ( program i d 30050 : star formation in bright rimmed clouds by fazio et al . ) .",
    "the irac data were taken in the high dynamic readout ( hdr ) mode using a single aor ( astronomical observation request ) with a five - point dither pattern .",
    "we have processed both the short ( 0.6  sec ) and the long ( 12  sec ) integration basic calibrated data ( bcd ) frames in each channel using the artifact mitigation software developed by sean carey and created mosaics using mopex .",
    "these irac observations go far deeper than any previous observations of orii-2 . in the short wavelength bands we can detect point - sources down to 30  40  @xmath17jy and are slightly less sensitive in the long wavelength bands , but in regions without nebulosity",
    "we can still detect point - sources down to @xmath4 60 @xmath17jy .",
    "we have also created mosaics of the mips 24 and 70   bcds using mopex .",
    "both data sets are of excellent quality .",
    "the 70 @xmath17m - image , due to the lower angular resolution , shows only one bright point - like source embedded in the globule .",
    "the image also shows strong emission from the hot ionized rim facing @xmath3 ori and fainter emission on the western side of the globule .",
    "we have carried out multiframe psf photometry using the ssc - developed tool apex on all the _ spitzer _ irac images and on the mips images .",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5  irac images show signs of saturation on bright stars . we have used combination of automated routines and eye - inspection to detect sources and extract photometry of these sources from the irac and mips images . for sources ,",
    "which apex failed to detect at one or several wavelengths , we have used the user list option in apex to supply the coordinates for the source to extract it and perform photometry on it .",
    "this enabled us to derive photometry for every source , which we could visually identify on any image .    in the irac images",
    "we have detected 118 , 122 , 41 and 32 sources respectively at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  .",
    "since the field of view of the two irac cameras do not completely overlap , we end up with a total of 125 mid - infrared sources .",
    "we detect five of them in the 24  mips image , but only one in the 70   image .",
    "we have crosscorrelated the sources detected in the irac and mips bands , and the 2mass point source catalogue .",
    "we have used the following association radii : 1  for the irac images , 25 for the mips 24  image and 2  for 2mass data .",
    "table  [ tab_mirsrc ] gives the coordinates of the 125 sources identified in orii-2 together with their @xmath0-band and 2mass magnitudes , _ spitzer _ irac and mips flux densities and a preliminary classification based on selected color - color plots . in table",
    "[ tab_mirsrc ] we have given them the prefix orii-2 , but throughout the paper we simply refer to them as mir - nn , where nn is the number of the source . out of the 125 sources 51 were found to have 2mass counterparts .",
    "all the sources detected in the mips  24  image were also detected in the four irac bands .",
    "we find that around 50% of the sources in the list have been detected only at 3.6 and 4.5  and have no counterparts in 2mass as well , although many of them are seen in the deep @xmath0-band image .",
    "the optical ccd images presented here were obtained on october 26 2007 using the 2.56  m nordic optical telescope ( not ) located at el observatorio del roque de los muchachos on the island of la palma in the canary islands .",
    "we used the andalucia faint object spectrometer and camera ( alfosc ) , which uses a thinned loral 2048 @xmath2 2048 ccd array with 15  @xmath17 m pixels giving a field of view of 6.5 @xmath2 6.5 arcmin@xmath18 with 0.187 arcseconds  pixel@xmath19 .",
    "for these observations we obtained two images with 300 seconds exposure time in bessel r ( 6500  ) separated by offsets of @xmath2090,+90  from the center of the globule in right ascension and declination , and a short 30 second exposure centered on the globule .",
    "we also observed the globule in narrow - band h@xmath1 .",
    "the narrow band h@xmath1 filter was a circular filter giving a more restricted field of view and centered on 6564    with a bandwidth of 33  .",
    "here we obtained two images , each with 300 second exposure and separated by 60  in right ascension .",
    "the observing conditions were excellent with an average seeing of @xmath4 075 .",
    "the images were reduced with the starlink program suite ccdpack .",
    "the transformation to the world coordinate system ( wcs ) was done using the starlink program gaia and we used more than twenty 2mass stars as astrometric reference stars .",
    "the 2mass stars have very good astrometric accuracy and the fit to these reference stars indicate that the astrometry of the ccd images have an accuracy of @xmath21 01 for both the r and the narrow - band h@xmath1 image compared to the 2mass reference frame .",
    "the images of the photometric standard stars were unavailable , hence the @xmath0-band image was calibrated using the 30 second exposure and seven stars in the 14 - 15@xmath15 range from the usno - a2.0 catalogue .",
    "we estimate the photometric calibration accuracy to be @xmath4 0.1 - 0.2@xmath15 .",
    "this calibration was transferred to the h@xmath1 image using a somewhat larger set of overlapping stars with approximately neutral colors judged from 2mass j magnitudes .",
    "the h@xmath1 image is estimated to have a photometric accuracy no better than 0.3@xmath15 .",
    "the r band image has a limiting magnitude of @xmath4 23.5@xmath15 and stars brighter than 15@xmath15 are partially saturated .",
    "we did aperture photometry in r and h@xmath1 of all stars , which coincided with an irac source to within 1 .",
    "we present only the result of the r band photometry in table  [ tab_mirsrc ] .",
    "the h@xmath1 is virtually identical , except for one star , see below .",
    "we detect all 2mass sources in r band as well as 26 irac sources without 2mass detection .",
    "comparison of the r and h@xmath1 photometry revealed only one h@xmath1 emission line star .",
    "mir-52 has an h@xmath1 magnitude of @xmath4 18.5 , while it is @xmath4 19.9 in r ( table  [ tab_mirsrc ] ) .",
    "the excess seen in h@xmath1 , 1.4@xmath15 , is much larger than our photometric uncertainty .",
    "therefore the star is definitely an h@xmath1 emission line star .",
    "mir-52 has a strong ir excess in the mips 24  band , so that we identify it as a class ii object based on irac and mips color color diagrams , see section  [ sec_ysoclass ] .",
    "the 850 @xmath17 m and 450 @xmath17 m continuum observations were obtained with bolometer array scuba on jcmt , mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "scuba @xcite has 37 bolometers in the long and 91 in the short wavelength array separated by approximately two beam widths in a hexagonal pattern .",
    "the field of view of both arrays is @xmath42.3 .",
    "both arrays can be used simultaneously by means of a dichroic beamsplitter .",
    "the scuba observations reported in this paper were all obtained in jiggle - map mode @xcite .",
    "on october 17 , 1997 we obtained two separate five integration maps with a chop throw of 100 in azimuth ; which unfortunately was not sufficient to completely chop outside of the globule . on december 17 , 1997",
    "we therefore used a 120  chop with a fixed position angle of 80  measured from north ( equatorial reference frame ) .",
    "this time we obtained three maps , each with small position offsets ( dither ) with three , eight , and five integrations .",
    "the total integration time from both nights was therefore 3328 seconds .",
    "the sky conditions were good on both nights .",
    "on october 17 the atmospheric opacity measured with the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) taumeter , cso @xmath22 was @xmath4 0.07 , and on december 17 @xmath23 was 0.04 - 0.05 .",
    "the dust emission from the globule is too extended to be observed in jiggle map mode and the emission from the cold cloud core is therefore likely to be underestimated , especially at 450 @xmath17 m .",
    "any strong emission in the off source positions was carefully blanked out in the data reduction stage .",
    "it should not affect the morphology or photometry of the strong , compact source , which dominates the emission both at 850 and 450 @xmath17 m .",
    "pointing corrections were derived from observations of the blazar 0528 + 134 on october 17 , and the blazar 0529 + 075 on december 17 .",
    "the secondary calibrators crl618 and hl  tau were used for flux density calibration .",
    "we estimate the calibration accuracy to be @xmath4 10% at 850  and @xmath4 20% at 450 . the half power beam width ( hpbw )",
    "was estimated from observations of uranus obtained in the early part of each night and was found to be @xmath4 145 ",
    "15  at 850 @xmath17 m and @xmath4 8   85 at 450 @xmath17 m .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard way using surf @xcite and starlink imaging software , i.e. , flat fielded , extinction corrected , sky subtracted , despiked , and calibrated the images in jy beam@xmath19 .",
    "each data set was corrected for any drift in pointing between successive pointing observations and the data were added together to determine the most likely submillimeter position at 850 .",
    "once we had derived a basic 850  astrometric image , we made gaussian fits of the compact sub - millimeter source in each data set and derived small additional ra and dec corrections to each scan ( shift and add ) to sharpen the final image to this position . since there is a small mis - alignment between the 850 and 450  arrays , we first corrected the 450  images for any pointing drifts and then did shift and add using the position derived at 850 .",
    "we estimate the astrometric accuracy to be @xmath24 2 .",
    "the final coadd was done by noise - weighting the data in order to minimize the noise in the final images .",
    "the rms of the 450  image is @xmath4 0.50 mjy beam@xmath19 and @xmath4 10 mjy beam@xmath19 for the 850  image .",
    "all the maps were converted to fits - files and exported to miriad @xcite for further analysis . in order to correct for the error lobe contribution , especially at 450",
    ", we have deconvolved all the maps using clean with the same beam model used by @xcite . since the hpbw varies slightly from night to night , this model beam is not ideal , but it is the best we can do .",
    "the actual beam size is probably somewhat more extended .",
    "figure  [ fig_scuba ] shows the 450 and 850   scuba images of orii-2 .",
    "these images show a single bright source , located at the head of the globule beyond the optically bright rim .",
    "this source , smm1 , is coincident with mir-54 , which is the only source seen in the mips 70  image . in order to derive the position and size of smm1 we have fitted a two component elliptical gaussian using the task imfit in miriad , one for the sub - mm source , and the other for the surrounding cloud .",
    "the fit to the broader component is mainly to provide a good subtraction of the extended emission , and is not to estimate the flux density of the surrounding cloud .",
    "the sub - millimeter position is @xmath1(2000.0 ) = 05@xmath25 38@xmath15 05098 , @xmath26(2000.0 ) = @xmath27 01  45  114 .",
    "the integrated flux densities are 0.54 @xmath5 0.08 jy and 3.36 @xmath5 0.75 jy for 850 and 450 , respectively .",
    "the fitted size , 179@xmath2 154 , should be considered an upper limit , since the true beam sizes were probably somewhat larger than the model beams used for deconvolving the images .",
    "since orii-2 lies within the @xmath3 orionis cluster ( age @xmath4 3 myr ) , we expect to detect some young stars belonging to the cluster in the 5  @xmath2 5  field that we are analyzing .",
    "stars belonging to the @xmath3 orionis cluster should be preferentially located outside the globule and generally appear older than stars that have recently formed in the globule .    figure  [ fig_composite ] present three - color images of orii-2 using irac 3.6 , 4.5 and 8  in the _ left _ panel and the irac 3.6 and 8  bands combined with the mips 24 channel in the _ right _ panel .",
    "both images show that the front side of the globule , which is dominated by strong polyaromatic hydrocarbon emission ( pah - emission ) is far from smooth .",
    "this may in part be due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities at the ionization front , but it is also due to outflows from the young stars which have recently formed in the cloud .",
    "the outflow from mir-54 ( iras  05355 - 0146 ) , the bright red star in the irac / mips color image , is clearly seen as a cavity like structure to the east of the star and a bluish nebulosity on the western side of the star .",
    "this outflow is very prominent in the h@xmath1 image ( figure  [ fig_halpha_rband ] ) , where it shows up as a limb brightened cavity , extending @xmath4 50  from the western edge of the globule and @xmath4 1.5  from the star exciting it .",
    "another outflow just south of the h@xmath1 outflow and approximately aligned with it , can be seen in the irac images terminating at a blue star ( unrelated to the outflow ) .",
    "this outflow is powered by another young star , mir-52 , @xmath4 20  to the south of mir-54 . to the east both outflows overlap .",
    "the western side of the globule is very sharp with an ionized rim . to the east",
    "the the boundary between the globule on the surrounding region is more diffuse .",
    "the most opaque part of the globule is just north or northwest of the iras source .",
    "the bright star located @xmath4 43  away from mir-54 in the color image is sao  132389 ( hd  37389 ) .",
    "this star , identified as mir-73 in table  [ tab_mirsrc ] , is detected even at 24  , although it is an unreddened foreground a0 star with an @xmath28 .",
    "the star has a radial velocity of @xmath29  km  s@xmath19 , which is very different from the radial velocity ( 12  ) of orii-2 @xcite .",
    "most of the faint stars outside the globule are field stars , although a few are young stars belonging to the @xmath3-orionis cluster .",
    "the irac and mips data are ideal for detecting young stellar objects ; especially in obscured regions like in orii-2 , which has a visual extinction exceeding 20@xmath15 . outside the globule , where the extinction is low , search for brown dwarfs , for which the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peaks at j , can be most efficiently performed using near - infrared data .",
    "however , we go deeper than 2mass in the 3.6 and 4.5  irac bands .",
    "the same is true even for the not broadband r filter .",
    "there is therefore no particular advantage in using the 2mass data alone .",
    "all 2mass sources in our field have also been detected by irac , at least in the two short wavelength bands .",
    "furthermore , at the distance of the @xmath3 orionis cluster only the brightest m dwarfs are barely detectable with 2mass .",
    "since we can see several galaxies in the deep r band image , we first analyzed the irac data to eliminate any galaxies , which could have mir colors similar to a yso .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that ( a ) normal star - forming galaxies and narrow - line agns with increasing 5.8 and 8.0  and ( b ) broad - line agns with red , nonstellar seds , result in colors which are very similar to bona - fide ysos .",
    "it is therefore necessary to inspect deep irac images for contamination due to the extragalactic sources . @xcite",
    "have extensively discussed the criteria for identifying such extragalactic objects in the irac color - color diagrams .",
    "if we use the criteria given in the appendix of their paper , we identify mir-16 , 25 , 88 , 89 , 93 , and 114 as extragalactic .",
    "however , inspection of these sources in the r - band ccd image , which was taken in excellent seeing conditions , suggests that most of them are stellar , with the exception of mir-93 .",
    "this source is clearly extended , and therefore it is an extragalactic source . for mir-88 , which is close to the detection limit in the r - band ,",
    "we get no help from the r band image , it could be stellar , or it could be extragalactic .",
    "mir-89 , which is not detected in the r band , was also identified as an extragalactic object .",
    "however , not only irac , but also the mips colors suggest that mir-89 is a class 0/i object . this classification is also supported by its location in the eastern side of the bright rim .",
    "we therefore only positively identify mir-93 as an extragalactic object .",
    "figure  [ fig_iracmipscol ] presents color - color diagrams of 2mass , irac and mips 24  sources detected in the orii-2 field .",
    "we have used several criteria ( shown as dashed lines and boxes in figure  [ fig_iracmipscol ] ) to identify potential pms stars using these color - color diagrams .",
    "the most stringent classification scheme uses the irac ( [ 3.6][5.8 ] ) colors and the [ 8][24 ] irac and mips color . at 24  the reddening due to extinction is small and the photospheric colors are very close to zero for all spectral types @xcite .",
    "therefore the [ 8][24 ] color is very sensitive to infrared excess , but of course not all young stars bright are enough to be detected at 24 . using this color - color diagram",
    "we find four sources with infrared excess ( figure  [ fig_iracmipscol ] ( _ left _ ) ) .",
    "we identify mir-54 and mir-89 as class 0/i sources , while mir-41 and mir-52 are in the class ii regime .",
    "figure  [ fig_iracmipscol ]  ( _ middle _ ) presents the [ 3.6][4.5 ] vs [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] color - color plot for the sources detected in all the irac bands .",
    "sources with the colors of stellar photospheres are centered at ( [ 3.6][4.5],[5.8][8.0])=(0,0 ) and include foreground and background stars as well as diskless ( class iii ) pre - main sequence stars .",
    "the box outlined in figure  [ fig_iracmipscol ] ( _ middle _ ) , defines the location of class ii objects @xcite , i.e. sources whose colors can be explained by young , low - mass stars surrounded by disks .",
    "@xcite have shown from their observations of young stars in the taurus - auriga complex that class 0/i protostars require [ 3.6][4.5]@xmath30 and [ 5.8][8.0]@xmath30 . while mir-89 clearly falls in the class 0/i region , mir-54 does not .",
    "it is well above the horizontal line corresponding to [ 3.6][4.5]=0.7 , but the color [ 5.8][8.0 ] is slightly less than 0.7 .",
    "since the demarcating lines primarily serve as a guidance and mir-54 is securely identified as a class 0/i object based on the irac / mips color - color plot , we identify it as a class 0/i object here as well . in this color - color diagram",
    "five stars end up in the class ii color regime : mir-23 ( marginally ) , mir-25 , mir-41 , mir-51 , and mir-88 .",
    "mir-51 , which shows a large excess in the [ 5.8][8.0 ] color is a class ii / i source , i.e. a flat spectrum source .",
    "we did not pick up mir-52 , because the [ 3.6][4.5 ] color is only 0.12 , yet it is the only strong h@xmath1 emission line star in our sample ( see section  [ not ] ) and definitely a pms star .",
    "it has , however , a strong infrared excess longward of 8  , which is why it was picked up in the [ 3.6][5.8 ] vs. [ 8][24 ] color - color diagram .",
    "@xcite also investigated color - color diagrams using the shortest irac bands , which have the highest sensitivity and which are least affected by pah emission with near - ir colors taken from the 2mass catalogue .",
    "we have similarly used the photometry for the sources presented in table  [ tab_mirsrc ] which have 2mass counterparts to plot the @xmath31[3.6 ] versus [ 3.6][4.5 ] color - color diagram ( figure  [ fig_iracmipscol ] _ right _ ) .",
    "we identify 12 potential pms stars , i.e. stars which are located outside the box demarcating stellar sources .",
    "these sources are mir-10 , 29 , 41 , 47 , 49 , 51 , 52 , 61 , 63 , 78 , 93 , and 117 . if we account for the large errors in faint 2mass sources we find at least one more source , mir-17 , which appears to have a clear excess in the 5.8  filter .",
    "for both mir-10 and 78 the 2mass @xmath31 fluxes have large uncertainties .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have additional evidence of ir excess in order to justify their classification as pms objects .",
    "while mir-10 shows a clear excess at 5.8  , mir-78 is not detected beyond 4.5  and it s sed is completely stellar with no sign of an ir excess .",
    "thus we do not consider mir-78 to be a pms object . since mir-93 was found to be an extragalactic source , we are left with 10 potential pms stars .",
    "of these we have already identified mir-41 , 49 , 51 and 52 as pms stars based on mir color - color plots .",
    "the two class 0/i sources , mir-54 and 89 , and mir-88 , a potential class ii source , were not detected in @xmath31 , and hence do not appear in this color - color diagram .",
    "neither do the sources mir-23 , and 25 , both of which were classified as pms objects in the irac color - color diagram , show @xmath31[3.6 ] or [ 3.6][4.5 ] colors expected for class ii objects .",

    "this archive also provides a linear regression tool which can select all model seds that fit the observed sed better than a specified @xmath34 .",

    "is a stage 0/i object , while all the others are stage ii objects . at a first glance it is surprising to find that mir-89 , which we classified as a young class 0/i object both in the irac and irac - mips color - color diagrams , is now identified as an evolved stage ii object .",
    "the sed model shows that it only has a minuscular envelope and there is no sign of envelope accretion .",

    "mir-51 , which we identified as a class i / ii object based on color - color diagrams , appears more similar to mir-52 ( class ii object ) and if anything slightly older , not younger .",
    "both appear to be young stage ii objects ( @xmath40/@xmath41 10@xmath42 yr@xmath19 and @xmath43/  @xmath41 10@xmath44 ) and are embedded inside the globule .",
    "this is consistent with mir-52 having strong h@xmath1 emission and powering an outflow .",
    "the sed models place mir-23 and 41 as late stage ii objects .",
    "they have no measurable envelope and very low disk accretion rates ( table  [ tab_sedfits ] ) .",
    "the models also suggest no or low foreground extinction .",
    "these results of modeling together with the location of these two objects in the region suggest that these objects are therefore more evolved pms stars belonging to the @xmath3-orionis cluster , although we can not exclude that they could have formed in the globule at an earlier epoch .",
    "we could not obtain any believable dust / envelope models for mir-10 , 17 , 25 , and 88 , which are all outside the globule in regions of low or moderate extinction , or for mir-49 , which is located in the most opaque part of the globule .",
    "we therefore fitted these objects with pure stellar atmospheric models reddened by foreground extinction .",
    "these fits are not very accurate , since we have no optical data , other than the r magnitudes .",
    "furthermore , mir-10 , 17 and 49 were not detected at 8 , while mir-88 was not detected by 2mass .",

    "it is therefore a reddened background star .",
    "most of the stars , which could not be fit with accretion disk models , appear to be reddened background stars , except perhaps for mir-10 and 25 , both of which could have some long wavelength excess .",
    "it is possible that they could be transitional disk objects belonging to the @xmath4 3 myr @xmath3 orionis cluster .",
    "transitional disk objects are stars , for which the inner disk has been cleared out , see e.g. @xcite , and which therefore do not show any excess until 6 or 8  .    for mir-54 the models completely fail to reproduce the observed sub - millimeter flux densities , irrespective of the values of any of the input parameters .",
    "we discuss mir-54 in more detail in section  [ sect_mir-54 ] .",
    "based on our sed modeling we conclusively identify six pms stars .",
    "all the pms stars in the orii-2 region appear to be low luminosity stars of spectral types k and m. the pms stars outside the globule have very low disk masses and disk accretion rates , 10@xmath48 to a few times 10@xmath49  yr@xmath19 ( table  [ tab_sedfits ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising since these stars are most likely members of the @xmath3-orionis cluster , which has an age of @xmath4 3  myr @xcite .",
    "mir-54 is the mid - infrared counterpart to iras  05355 - 0146 , which was detected in all four iras bands .",
    "mir-54 is within 13  of the nominal iras position .",

    "the mips 70  flux density for mir-54 is @xmath50  jy . the iras flux densities are much higher than what we observe with mips .",
    "this is to be expected , since the large iras beam will include emission from the hot bright rim as well .",
    "the luminosity for the iras source , i.e. mir-54 , has therefore been severely over estimated in the past .",
    "we can obtain a more precise estimate of the bolometric luminosity by doing a greybody fit to the mips and scuba data .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig_greyfit ] where we show a two - component greybody fit to the observed flux densities between 24 and 850  .",
    "based on the observed size of the source in the mid - infrared and sub - mm , we have assumed @xmath51 to be 10and 13  for the warm and the cold components , respectively .",

    "the observed sed of the source is reasonably well fit using this simple two - temperature greybody model and it is consistent with the observed 1.3  mm flux density .",
    "however we could not derive a single radiative transfer based model , which reproduces the entire sed starting from 3.6  to the sub - mm wavebands ( figure  [ fig_sedfits ] ) .",
    "the model is particularly poor at the longer wavelengths .",
    "however , both the greybody model and the radiation transfer based models give a luminosity of 1.31.8  and mass of 0.190.24  .",
    "mir-54 is therefore a deeply embedded ( not detected in the near - ir ) low - mass , very young object .",
    "it excites an h@xmath33o maser @xcite .",
    "it is most likely the exciting source for the large parsec scale outflow , hh289 .",
    "inside the globule this is seen as a low velocity molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "the outflow is also visible in the irac images ( section  [ sec_hh992 ] ) .",
    "the sed modeling predicts @xmath40/@xmath4 2  10@xmath59 yr@xmath19 , which satisfies the criterion ( @xmath40/@xmath41 10@xmath60 yr@xmath19 ) used by @xcite to identify stage 0/i objects . since mir-54 powers",
    "such a large outflow , it is probably not a class 0 ( or stage 0 ) protostar , but rather a deeply embedded , somewhat more evolved class i protostar .",
    "we find clear evidence for triggered star formation in the cometary globule orii-2 , with four young stars embedded in the front side of the globule .",
    "the pms object furthest away from the bright rim and approximately at the center of the globule , mir-54 , is a young class i or stage i protostar .",
    "it is most likely responsible for the large parsec scale herbig - haro outflow , with its counter flow seen as a bright h@xmath1 outflow breaking out on the western side of the globule .",
    "however , mir-52 , the heavily obscured h@xmath1 emission line star @xmath4 20  south of mir-54 , also appears to drive an outflow , which is approximately aligned with the outflow from mir-54 . to the east both outflows overlap , and either star could therefore be the exciting star for the large hh outflow .",
    "mir-89 , which is located in the bright rim , is a more evolved class ii object , which most likely excites the hh object , hh992 , which we discovered in this study .",
    "hh992 lies outside the globule , @xmath4 65  east of the star and south of the large herbig - haro outflow , hh289 .",
    "hh992 breaks up into three knots , and must be rather low excitation , since it is not seen in the h@xmath1 image .",
    "another candidate young star , mir-104 , which is close to the globule and near mir-89 ( figure  [ fig_halpha_rband ] ) may also have formed in the globule .",
    "however , mir-104 was only detected at 5.8 and 8  and we therefore have insufficient information to determine whether it really is a pms object .",
    "if it is , it could have formed inside the globule before the gas was ablated away by the strong uv radiation from @xmath3 ori .",
    "we identify two infrared excess stars , one of which is far to the south , @xmath42   from the globule and the other is seen in projection against the bright rim in the tail region of the globule .",
    "both these sources have zero or very little foreground extinction and are probably unrelated to the globule , although we can not exclude the possibility that they could have formed in the globule in an earlier epoch of star formation .",
    "we also find two other candidate pms stars in the field , which may have weak mid - ir excesses .",
    "all these stars appear older , i.e. they are pre - transitional or transitional disk stars , which now are part of @xmath3-orionis cluster , which has an age of @xmath4 3 myr .",
    "models of cometary globules can successfully explain their morphology and suggest that they form stars through radiation driven implosion ( rdi ) @xcite .",
    "this was already qualitatively discussed by @xcite , who showed that cometary globules are active sites of star formation . in these models",
    "cometary globules are denser cores in the molecular cloud surrounding an region , which get exposed to the uv radiation from the central ob association , when the region expands into it .",
    "the uv flux of the ob association ionizes the external layers of the core facing the ob association and an ionization front is formed at the front surface .",
    "the gas is heated during the ionization and the temperature increases .",
    "the increased pressure due to the hot ionized gas drives an isothermal shock into the cloud , which compresses the neutral gas in the core . at the same time",
    ", the ionized and heated gas at the surface of the core flows radially away from the surface and forms an evaporating layer surrounding the surface of the core . due to the curvature of the front surface of the core the shock waves preceding",
    "the ionization front converge and collide at their focus , causing the interior of core to be compressed to much higher densities .",
    "this causes the central part of the core to become gravitationally unstable , triggering the formation of a star .",
    "the observations of @xcite of the isolated cometary globule brc37 in the region ic1396 appears to match this model rather well .",
    "their observations show a string of pms objects along the symmetry axis of the globule , with the oldest being in front of the globule , and the youngest object still embedded in the head of the globule , suggesting sequential formation of young stars as the ionization front proceeds towards the tail of the globule . for some of the other cometary globules in the same region , like ic1396n ( brc38 ) , this scenario is less clear .",
    "@xcite found an elongated clustering of x - ray sources aligned with the globule , with the youngest stars still embedded inside it , consistent with the rdi model for triggered star formation .",
    "however @xcite , who studied the same cometary globule using deep j , h , k@xmath61 , and narrowband h@xmath33 2.12  imaging and previously published mm imaging did not find any color or age gradient in the south - north direction , i.e. in the direction of the globule . they therefore conclude that not all star formation in this globule can be explained in terms of triggering .",
    "we can think of two possible explanations for why ic1396n does not appear to show the same type of age progression and sequential triggering as seen in brc37 .",
    "if the x - ray sources in front of the globule are late class ii objects , i.e. transitional disk like objects , or class iii objects , they will show no color excess in the near - ir and therefore appear as field stars .",
    "secondly , ic1396n is not a well defined isolated cometary globule with a simple head / tail structure , suggesting that it could consist of more than one cometary globule .",
    "orii-2 , the cometary globule studied in this paper , does appear more similar to brc38 .",
    "it shows clear evidence for triggered star formation , with the youngest object , mir-54 , being furthest away from the front side of the globule .",
    "the two other young class ii objects are definitely older and closer to the bright rim and the ionizing star , @xmath3 orionis .",
    "all three stars are also close to the symmetry axis of the globule , as predicted by the rdi model .",
    "mir-89 and possibly mir-104 , which both lie on the eastern side of the globule , do not appear to have formed by focussed compression along the symmetry axis of the globule . other processes , like rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the bright rim , may also play a role and form low - mass stars like mir-89 .",
    "a similar situation is seen in the horsehead , a bright rimmed elephant trunk structure east of @xmath3 orionis , which also shows some evidence for sequential star formation triggered by the expanding region @xcite .",
    "these young pms stars are also low - mass stars , which appear to have formed in the bright rim by rayleigh - taylor instabilities , since hardly any of them lie close to the symmetry axis of the horsehead",
    ".    several , if not all of the young stars in orii-2 drive outflows .",
    "it is interesting to note that all of the outflows are roughly perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the globule .",
    "it maybe a coincidence , but other cometary globules with embedded protostars , like brc37 , show a similar behavior .",
    "if this is generally true , it would provide additional support to the focussed rdi model , which predicts that the gas inside a cometary globule will be compressed in a ridge along the symmetry axis of the globule .",
    "when density condensations , i.e. cores in this ridge become gravitationally unstable and collapse , the collapse would preferentially be towards the symmetry axis , therefore aligning the protoplanetary disk along the symmetry axis .",
    "since outflows are driven by disks , one would therefore see outflows which are perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the cometary globule .",
    "orii-2 is thus a low mass star forming cometary globule .",
    "the star formation in this region appears to be triggered by a combination of rdi and rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the rim of the globule . in the deep r - band images for the first time we detect hh  992 , which based on its non - detection in the  image",
    "is most likely an extremely low excitation hh object .",
    "follow - up optical and infrared spectroscopic observations to understand the true nature of hh  992 as well as mir-52 , the sole  emission star in the field , are needed .",
    "we find that many of the young stars drive outflows which are aligned perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the globule .",
    "higher spatial resolution imaging of the outflows in orii-2 in near - infrared and millimeter would provide structural details of the outflows and lead to correct identification of the sources exciting these outflows .    based on observations made with the nordic optical telescope , operated on the island of la palma jointly by denmark , finland , iceland , norway , and sweden , in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias .",
