    "nearly a decade ago , x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) were observationally recognized as a subclass within the sample of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) detected by the _",
    "bepposax _ wide - field cameras @xcite .",
    "the events are distinguished by a prompt spectrum that peaks in the soft x - ray range ( @xmath12 kev ) , a factor of @xmath13 below the typical values observed for grbs @xcite . since then",
    ", it has been shown that xrfs and grbs share many observational properties , including prompt emission durations @xcite , redshifts @xcite , broadband afterglows ( e.g. , xrf050406 , @xcite ) , and host galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent discovery of type ic supernovae ( sne ) in association with xrfs 020903 @xcite and 060218 @xcite indicate that xrfs , like grbs , are produced in massive stellar explosions . together",
    ", these clues strongly suggest that xrfs and grbs share similar progenitors .    driven by this progress ,",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain the soft prompt emission observed for xrfs under the framework of a standard grb model .",
    "one popular idea posits that xrfs are merely typical grbs viewed away from the collimation axis ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this scenario the prompt emission is primarily beamed away from our line - of - sight , resulting in lower fluence and @xmath14 values for the observed burst .",
    "an important implication of the off - axis model is that the early afterglow evolution should be characterized by a rising phase as the jet decelerates and spreads sideways into our line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "another theory suggests that xrfs are intrinsically different from grbs in their ability to couple energy to highly - relativistic material . in this scenario ,",
    "xrfs are produced in explosions characterized by lower bulk lorentz factors , @xmath15 , than those inferred for typical grbs , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this may be the result of baryon loading of the high - velocity ejecta , a so - called `` dirty fireball '' @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , low lorentz factor explosions may be identified through an analysis of their prompt emission since an optically thin spectrum at high energies implies a lower limit on the lorentz factor @xcite . in the case of x - ray flashes , however , there are generally insufficient high energy photons for this type of analysis . for these events , detailed modeling of the broadband afterglow may be used to place a lower limit on the lorentz factor .    here",
    "we present an extensive , multi - frequency data set for xrf050416a at @xmath0 which extends to @xmath17 days after the burst . by combining near - infrared , optical , ultra - violet , radio and x - ray data we present an in - depth analysis of the afterglow , energetics , supernova and host galaxy of , placing it among the best - studied x - ray flashes to date .",
    "moreover , thanks to our dedicated late - time monitoring campaign , we show that  produced a strong radio flare at @xmath6 days accompanied by a brief plateau phase in the x - ray band .",
    "finally , we discuss the nature of  in the context of off - axis and dirty fireball models for x - ray flashes .",
    "xrf050416a was discovered by the _ swift _",
    "burst alert telescope ( bat ) on 2005 april 16.4616 ut . the ratio of @xmath18 kev and @xmath19 kev channel fluences , @xmath20 , classifies the event as an x - ray flash @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the low peak photon energy , @xmath21 kev @xcite ; a factor of @xmath13 lower than the typical values observed for long - duration grbs @xcite and a factor of @xmath22 larger than the values inferred for xrfs 020903 and 060218 @xcite    as discussed by @xcite , the prompt emission light - curve is characterized by a relatively smooth , triangular peak which is only detected at energies below 50 kev .",
    "the burst duration is @xmath23 sec ( 15 - 150 kev ) , placing it between the classes of short- and long - duration grbs while the hardness ratio shows a clear softening .",
    "in addition , @xcite note two intriguing features of the data : ( 1 ) the rise time of the pulse is longer than the decay time , and ( 2 ) the cross - correlation lag function ( an indication of the spectral softening ) is @xmath24 sec , apparently inconsistent with the overall softening trend observed for the light - curves .",
    "this lag function estimate is significantly different than the typical values inferred for long - duration grbs and even more extreme than the zero spectral lags inferred for short - hard bursts @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the spectral lag for  was derived through a comparison of the two softest bat bands ( 15 - 25 and 25 - 50 kev ) and therefore prevents a clear comparison with the spectral lag estimates for other _ swift _ grbs for which 15 - 25 and 50 - 100 kev bands are typically used .",
    "given that the temporal evolution is not strongly variable , this may indicate that the prompt emission was produced by another process ( e.g. external shocks , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that this burst is inconsistent with the lag - luminosity correlation for long - duration grbs which posits that low luminosity bursts such as  have long spectral lags @xcite .      using the roboticized palomar 60-inch telescope ( p60 )",
    "we initiated observations of the field of xrf050416a at 2005 april 16.4634 ut ( 2.5 minutes after the burst ) . in our first 120 second image we discovered a new source within the _ swift_/bat error circle at @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec in each coordinate based on an astrometric tie to the usno - b catalog ( figure  [ fig : field ] ) .",
    "we subsequently monitored the afterglow evolution with the palomar 60-inch , 200-inch , and siding springs 2.3-meter telescopes in the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30band through @xmath31 days .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on each of the images in the standard method using the apphot package within iraf .",
    "absolute calibration of @xmath32- , @xmath33- , and @xmath29band light - curves was derived using the field calibration of @xcite and utilizing the transformation equations of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34-band light - curve was calibrated against 2mass using 15 unconfused sources .",
    "the errors resulting from calibration uncertainty ( @xmath35 ) were added in quadrature to the measurement errors . as shown in figure  [ fig : niropt_model_ltcurves2 ] and table  [ tab : niropt ] , the afterglow was @xmath36 mag at @xmath37 min ( mid - exposure ) .",
    "we supplement these nir / optical afterglow data with additional measurements from the gcns @xcite and those reported by @xcite , obtained with the _ swift_/uvot and 1.54-m danish telescope .",
    "the resulting dataset spans 1930  ( _ swift_/uvot uvw2 ) to 22000  ( @xmath34 ) ; however , we note that the majority of the uv observations are upper limits . using this extended dataset",
    "we measure the temporal and spectral properties of the nir / optical afterglow emission .",
    "we find the following nir / optical power - law decay indices ( @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ) between @xmath40 and 1 day : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , consistent with the values reported by @xcite .",
    "these values imply a mean temporal index of @xmath46 .",
    "finally , we analyze the spectral index ( @xmath47 with @xmath48 ) within the nir / optical bands .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] there are two epochs at which the photometric spectrum is well - sampled : @xmath49 and 0.8 days .",
    "we fit each of the observed spectra with a simple power - law and find @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) for the first and second epochs , respectively . as will be discussed in ",

    "( _ hst _ ) , we imaged the field of xrf050416a four times , spanning 37 to 219 days after the burst .",
    "each epoch consisted of two or four orbits during which we imaged the field in filters f775w and/or",
    "f850lp , corresponding to sdss @xmath54- and @xmath55- bands , respectively .",
    "the _ hst _ data were processed using the multidrizzle routine @xcite within the stsdas package of iraf .",
    "images were drizzled using pixfrac=0.8 and pixscale=1.0 resulting in a final pixel scale of 0.05 arcsec / pixel .",
    "drizzled images were then registered to the final epoch using the xregister package within iraf .",
    "we astrometrically tied the _ hst _ and p60 images using 12 unconfused sources in common resulting in a final systematic uncertainty of 0.70 arcsec ( @xmath56 ) .    to search for source variability and remove host galaxy contamination , we used the _ isis _ subtraction routine by @xcite which accounts for temporal variations in the stellar psf . adopting the final epoch observations as templates we produced residual images .",
    "these residual images were examined for positive sources positionally coincident with the p60 afterglow .",
    "photometry was performed on the residual sources within a 0.5 arcsec aperture .",
    "we converted the photometric measurements to infinite aperture and calculated the corresponding ab magnitudes within the native _ hst _ filters using the aperture corrections and zero - points provided by @xcite .",
    "here we made the reasonable assumption that the transient flux is negligible in the template images .",
    "for comparison with ground - based data , we also converted the f775w measurements to johnson @xmath33-band ( vega ) magnitudes using the transformation coefficients derived by @xcite and assuming the @xmath57 source spectrum implied by the first epoch _",

    "the observed spectral index between the f775w and f850lp filters is @xmath64 , significantly steeper than the afterglow spectrum observed at early time (  [ sec : optical ] and figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) as well as the typical values measured for nir / optical afterglows ( @xmath65 ; @xcite ) . as will be discussed in ",

    "the prompt energy release of  is a factor of @xmath76 lower ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we began observing xrf050416a with the very large array ( vla ) on 2005 april 16.49 ut ( @xmath62 min ) .",
    "no radio source was detected coincident with the optical position to a limit of @xmath77jy at @xmath78 ghz .",
    "however , further observations at @xmath79 days revealed a new radio source with @xmath80jy coincident with the optical and x - ray afterglow positions at @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( j2000 ) which we identify as the radio afterglow .",
    "we continued to monitor the radio afterglow at 1.43 , 4.86 and 8.46 ghz through @xmath83 days ( table  [ tab : vla ] ) .",
    "all observations were taken in standard continuum observing mode with a bandwidth of @xmath84 mhz .",
    "we used 3c286 ( j1331 + 305 ) for flux calibration , while phase referencing was performed against calibrators j1221 + 282 and j1224 + 213 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard packages within the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : vla_lt_curve ] , the evolution of the radio afterglow is dissimilar from those of typical grbs and inconsistent with a standard blastwave model . between @xmath3 and 40 days an abrupt rebrightening ( factor of @xmath22 ) is observed at all radio bands with a temporal index steeper than @xmath85 . following this radio",
    "flare the emission decays rapidly with an index of @xmath86 .",
    "the peak radio luminosity at 8.46 ghz , @xmath87 , is typical for grbs @xcite , a factor of @xmath13 and @xmath88 larger than those of xrfs 020903 and 060218 , respectively @xcite , and between @xmath89 and @xmath90 times higher than the peak radio luminosities observed for optically - selected type ibc supernovae @xcite .",
    "by @xmath91 days the radio afterglow is no longer detected at any frequency .",
    "the afterglow of xrf050416a was observed with the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) beginning @xmath92 minutes after the burst and continuing through @xmath93 days , placing it among the best studied x - ray afterglows to date @xcite . from their analysis of the xrt data , @xcite report a spectral index of @xmath94 and evidence for significant absorption in the host galaxy , @xmath95 , corresponding to @xmath96 assuming the conversion of @xcite and a milky way extinction curve @xcite . as shown in figure  [ fig : xrt_lt_curve ] , at @xmath97 hours the x - ray luminosity was @xmath98 , placing it at the lower edge of the observed distribution for grbs @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and shown in figure  [ fig : xrt_lt_curve ] , the early evolution of the x - ray afterglow can be characterized by three phases : ( 1 ) an initial steep decay ( 2 ) a flattening between @xmath31 and 20 minutes during which the flux is roughly constant , and ( 3 ) a resumed decay through @xmath3 days .",
    "these three phases have been shown to be ubiquitous among _ swift _ x - ray afterglows @xcite .",
    "however , at @xmath99 days there is a second flattening which continues through @xmath100 days .",
    "by @xmath101 days the x - ray afterglow is no longer detected , implying a significant steepening to @xmath102 between the last two observations .",
    "we note that the timescale for the x - ray flattening and subsequent steep decay is coincident with the observed radio flare .",
    "using the detailed multi - frequency observations of the  afterglow we can constrain the physical properties of the ejecta and the circumburst density .",
    "we adopt a standard relativistic blastwave model in which the afterglow emission is produced through the dynamical interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding medium ( the forward shock , fs ) with an additional component from shock heating of the ejecta ( the reverse shock , rs ) . in this scenario",
    ", the total energy density is partitioned between relativistic electrons , @xmath103 , and magnetic fields , @xmath104 , while the thermal energy of the shocked protons accounts for the fraction remaining ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the shocked electrons are accelerated into a power - law distribution , @xmath105 above a minimum lorentz factor , @xmath106 .",
    "the emission resulting from the forward and reverse shock components is described by a synchrotron spectrum characterized by three break frequencies  the self - absorption frequency , @xmath107 , the characteristic frequency , @xmath108 , and the cooling frequency , @xmath109  and a flux normalization , @xmath110 @xcite . in modeling the afterglow spectral and temporal evolution ,",
    "we adopt the formalism of @xcite for a relativistic forward shock expanding into a constant density circumburst medium .      in fitting the forward shock model to the afterglow data of  we use only observations between 0.014 and 20 days when the afterglow follows a simple power - law evolution .",
    "to constrain the spectrum of the forward shock , we first investigate the afterglow evolution in the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : xrt_lt_curve ] , the x - ray data between 0.014 and 20 days are reasonably fit with @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "@xcite report that the x - ray spectral index on this same timescale is @xmath113 , leading to @xmath114 .",
    "a comparison to the standard closure relations , @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) indicates that @xmath119 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the near - ir to x - ray spectral slope , @xmath120 at @xmath121 days , which is flatter than @xmath122 as expected if @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the x - ray observations suggest that @xmath124 .",
    "next we consider the spectral index within the nir / optical bands . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : optical ] and shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , the observed nir / optical spectral index on this timescale is @xmath50 to @xmath52 .",
    "these values are significantly steeper than @xmath125 and imply that the optical flux is suppressed by host galaxy extinction . making the reasonable assumption that @xmath126 on the timescale of our afterglow observations , and adopting @xmath127 as indicated by the x - ray observations , we estimate @xmath128 for the intrinsic spectral index of the nir / optical afterglow . adopting this value for @xmath129",
    ", we find that both nir / optical spectra are reasonably fit with a galactic extinction of @xmath130 @xcite and a host galaxy component of @xmath131 ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) . here",
    "we have assumed a milky way extinction model for the host @xcite but note that a comparable fit may be obtained for an smc extinction curve .",
    "we further note that this optically - derived extinction estimate is lower than that inferred from the x - ray spectrum @xcite , consistent with the trend observed for long - duration grbs @xcite .    with this extinction correction ,",
    "the near - ir to x - ray spectral index becomes @xmath132 , consistent with our estimate for the intrinsic spectral index within the nir / optical band .",
    "moreover , the extinction - corrected nir / optical spectral index and observed average temporal index of @xmath133 are consistent with the standard closure relation : @xmath134 .",
    "we also note that this supports our assumption of a constant density medium since in a wind environment the expected temporal index is steeper than @xmath135 , and thus inconsistent with the observed values . using all the available optical and x - ray observations we estimate that @xmath136 hz at @xmath137 day .",
    "next we compare the near - ir and radio afterglow data to constrain @xmath108 and the peak spectral flux , @xmath110 .",
    "assuming that @xmath108 passed through the nir / optical bands near the time of our first @xmath34-band observations implies that the peak spectral flux is roughly comparable to the extinction - corrected @xmath34 flux : @xmath138jy at @xmath139 minutes .",
    "here we focus on the @xmath34-band data since they are the least sensitive to host galaxy extinction , which we estimate to be @xmath140 mag ( a @xmath141 increase in flux ) for @xmath131 . scaling these constraints to @xmath137 day ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) and",
    "accounting for the smooth shape of the spectral peak , we find @xmath144 hz and @xmath145 . here and throughout , @xmath110 is the asymptotic extrapolation of the smooth spectrum peak and is therefore slightly higher than the intrinsic peak flux .",
    "we note that since the nir / optical data require @xmath146 , lower values of @xmath108 imply increasingly higher values of @xmath110 at the time of the first @xmath34-band observations .    finally , we test that these constraints are consistent with the radio observations . given the evolution of @xmath108",
    ", these constraints predict that the spectral peak should pass through the radio band at @xmath147 days with an extrapolated peak flux density of @xmath148jy , roughly consistent with the 4.86 ghz observations on this timescale .",
    "we emphasize that the early steady decay of the nir / optical data require that @xmath108 passes through the radio no later than 13 days .",
    "finally , we note that the radio spectrum is optically thin throughout the timescale of vla monitoring ( see figure  [ fig : vla_lt_curve ] ) and thus we observationally constrain @xmath107 to be below 1.43 ghz .      adopting these constraints",
    "we apply a broadband afterglow model fit to the multi - frequency data in order to determine the physical parameters of the burst .",
    "the four spectral parameters ( @xmath110 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) are fully determined by four physical parameters : the isotropic ejecta energy , @xmath149 , the energy density partition fractions , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and the circumburst density , @xmath150 .",
    "therefore by constraining the four spectral parameters through broad - band observations , we are able to determine a unique solution for the four physical parameters ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . although the radio observations provide only an upper limit on @xmath107 , we are able to define a range of reasonable values by requiring that @xmath103,@xmath151 which accounts for an equal or greater contribution from shocked protons .",
    "this requirement excludes unphysical solutions in which the sum of the contributions from shocked electrons , protons and magnetic fields exceed the total energy density .",
    "combined with the observed constraints for @xmath110 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 we find the following ranges for the physical parameters :    @xmath152    as shown in figures  [ fig : niropt_model_ltcurves2 ] , [ fig : vla_lt_curve ] , and [ fig : xrt_lt_curve ] , this model provides an adequate fit to the broadband data between @xmath153 and 20 days .",
    "the lack of an observed jet break in the x - rays to @xmath3 days , together with the inferred physical parameters constrain the opening angle of the jet ( e.g. @xcite ) to @xmath154 degrees . here , @xmath155 is the jet break time in days and we have adopted the notation @xmath156 .",
    "this limit is slightly larger than the median of the jet opening angles inferred for long - duration grbs , @xmath157 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this indicates that the beaming - corrected ejecta energy release is @xmath158 erg where the range includes the uncertainty in @xmath149 and the lower limit on @xmath159 .",
    "moreover , we expect the blastwave to become non - relativistic on a timescale @xmath160 yrs @xcite . on a similar timescale ,",
    "the ejecta are predicted to approach spherical symmetry after which the blastwave evolution is well described by the sedov - von neumann - taylor ( snt ) solution @xcite ; in this regime the afterglow emission decays with @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) for frequencies below ( above ) the cooling frequency .",
    "next , the early steady decay of the x - ray and nir / optical afterglow indicates that the jet collimation axis is directed roughly along our line - of - sight . in comparison ,",
    "grbs viewed significantly off - axis ( @xmath163 ) are predicted to show a rising afterglow light - curve as the jet spreads sideways and intersects our viewing angle @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath164 is the angle between our line - of - sight and the jet collimation axis .",
    "we conclude that the ejecta are viewed roughly on - axis and therefore the inferred beaming - corrected energies are not affected significantly ( if at all ) by viewing angle effects .",
    "next we address the nature of the late - time broadband afterglow evolution with special attention to the strong radio flare observed at @xmath165 days .",
    "radio flares have been noted for several other grbs , though only at early times ( e.g. grb990123 at @xmath166 day ; @xcite ) . based on their observed timescale and evolution ,",
    "radio flares are typically attributed to emission from the reverse shock @xcite . here",
    "we present detailed radio observations for xrf050416a which show for the first time a strong radio flare at late time .",
    "possible causes for a late - time radio rebrightening include the emission from a decelerating jet initially directed away from our line - of - sight @xcite , circumburst density variations @xcite , and energy injection from a slow shell catching up to and refreshing the afterglow shock @xcite .",
    "we discuss each of these possibilities below .",
    "it has been shown that the observational signature of a relativistic jet viewed significantly away from our line - of - sight is a rapid achromatic rise in the early afterglow light - curves @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed peak of the afterglow emission occurs as the spreading jet crosses our viewing angle .",
    "the timescale for this peak is @xmath76 days for a grb jet with typical parameters ( @xmath167 erg , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 ) viewed from an angle @xmath171 @xcite .",
    "the subsequent afterglow evolution is the same as that seen by an on - axis observer , decaying steeply with @xmath172 to @xmath173 $ ] for frequencies above @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "the observed timescale and evolution of the  radio flare are therefore roughly consistent with the predictions of an off - axis relativistic jet .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite and discussed in ",
    "[ sec : jet ] , the early and steady decay of the  broadband afterglow implies the presence of relativistic ejecta directed along our line - of - sight .",
    "these ejecta are also responsible for the production of the observed prompt emission . attributing the strong late - time radio flare to an energetic off - axis relativistic jet",
    "therefore implies that multiple relativistic ejecta components were produced in the explosion .",
    "moreover , the steep rise and peak flux of the radio flare imply sharp edges for the off - axis jet and a kinetic energy 2 to 3 times larger than that of the on - axis ejecta .",
    "while this scenario can not be ruled out , we consider it unlikely given the complicated ejecta geometry required .",
    "@xcite describe a related scenario in which a strong late - time radio flare is observed from a receding jet initially directed anti - parallel to our line - of - sight .",
    "in this case , early afterglow emission is expected from the approaching jet while emission from the receding jet is expected on a timescale @xmath174 due to the light travel time delay .",
    "this scenario is appealing in that it may explain both the early and late - time afterglow emission observed for  within the standard framework of engine - driven ( accretion - fed compact source ; @xcite ) double - sided jets .",
    "however , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : jet ] , broadband modeling of the afterglow emission predicts the non - relativistic transition to occur no earlier than @xmath175 yrs  too late to explain the radio flare at 40 days .",
    "moreover , the peak emission from a receding jet should be comparable to the radio flux at @xmath176 and decay with a temporal index given by the sedov solution , @xmath177 @xcite ; both of these predictions are inconsistent with the observations .",
    "we conclude that afterglow emission from a receding jet is unlikely to produce the observed radio flare .",
    "it has been argued that abrupt variations in the circumburst medium can produce a strong rebrightening in the radio afterglows of grbs .",
    "specifically , the dynamical interaction of the forward shock with a wind - termination shock at @xmath178 pc is predicted to cause a rebrightening of the radio afterglow on a timescale of a few years @xcite .",
    "here it is assumed that the blastwave is expanding non - relativistically when it encounters the density jump , overall consistent with the observed timescales for non - relativistic transitions @xcite . for comparison",
    ", the interaction of a relativistic blastwave with an abrupt ( step function ) density jump is not expected to cause strong variations in the afterglow light - curves , where here it has been assumed that the post - jump expansion is also relativistic @xcite .    in the case of ,",
    "the strong radio flare and x - ray plateau phase occur on a timescale when the blastwave is still relativistic , and therefore an abrupt circumburst density jump appears an unlikely explanation .",
    "this is supported by the fact that during the relativistic regime , the flux at frequencies above @xmath109 should be unaffected by circumburst density variations @xcite .",
    "we speculate , however , that a very large density jump may be able to decelerate the blastwave to non - relativistic speeds on a very short timescale and may therefore be able to explain the unusual late - time afterglow evolution .",
    "the increase in density would cause a shift in @xmath107 which may explain the peculiar evolution of the spectral index in the radio band ( figure  [ fig : vla_lt_curve ] ) . based on our afterglow modeling (  [ sec :",
    "fit ] ) , we estimate that the circumburst radius of the forward shock at the onset of the radio flare was roughly @xmath179 pc , roughly consistent with the radius of a wind - termination shock @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", we expect a post - jump self - similar evolution consistent with the sedov - taylor solution .",
    "since the late - time radio and x - ray data are not sufficiently sensitive to trace the post - flare evolution , we can not rule out this possibility .    finally , we investigated a scenario where the radio / x - ray flare is produced by the dynamical interaction of the quasi - spherical , non - relativistic sn ejecta with a csm density enhancement .",
    "in fact , density jumps have been invoked to explain radio modulations observed for local ( non - relativistic ) sne ibc ( e.g.  sn2003bg ; @xcite ) . adopting a simple minimum energy calculation @xcite and requiring that the shock energy is equally partitioned between magnetic fields and relativistic electrons",
    ", we find that attributing the strong radio emission to the quasi - spherical sn component requires that the sn ejecta is relativistic ( @xmath180 ) at the time of the radio / x - ray flare .",
    "however , as discussed above , strong flux variations are not expected while the blastwave is relativistic .",
    "combined with the fact that the flare is at least a factor of @xmath89 more radio luminous than any other sn ibc ever observed ( including grb - sn1998bw , @xcite ) , we conclude that the radio / x - ray flare can not be attributed to the quasi - spherical sn ejecta .",
    "an episode of energy injection may also cause a rebrightening of the afterglow flux .",
    "energy injection may arise from long - lived central engine activity or under the framework of a `` refreshed '' shock where a slow moving shell ejected during the initial burst eventually catches up with the afterglow shock @xcite .",
    "the observed ratio of the settling time to the epoch of injection , @xmath181 , can distinguish between these two scenarios .",
    "for @xmath182 the injection is produced by engine activity , while @xmath183 indicates a refreshed shock . in the case of ,",
    "the x - ray and radio data after 20 days imply @xmath184 , suggesting that the ejecta were refreshed on this timescale .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : vla_lt_curve ] , an extrapolation of the early radio evolution lies a factor of @xmath22 below the observed flux at the onset of the radio flare .",
    "an energy increase affects the spectral parameters according to the following scalings : @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "given that @xmath108 is within the radio band on this timescale we have @xmath189 and thus the radio flare corresponds to an energy injection of a comparable factor , @xmath22 .",
    "for the x - ray band , @xmath190 , thus for @xmath127 an energy injection of a factor of @xmath22 corresponds to a comparable increase in the x - ray flux .",
    "swift_/xrt observations suggest a flattening on this timescale . here",
    "we adopt the conservative assumption that the shock microphysics ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath191 ) do not evolve during the energy injection .    one important implication of the energy injection model is that the post - injection asymptotic temporal decay should be the same as that before the injection .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the energy injection episodes invoked for grbs 021004 and 030329 @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of , the late - time radio and x - ray data suggest a steep post - injection decay , @xmath192 , significantly steeper than that observed pre - injection . moreover , the afterglow should asymptotically approach a flux normalization larger by a factor of @xmath22 in both the radio and x - ray bands . as shown in figures  [ fig : vla_lt_curve ] and [ fig : xrt_lt_curve ] , this appears inconsistent with the observations which suggest that the late - time afterglow is comparable ( or fainter ) than an extrapolation of the early afterglow model .",
    "we note , however , that the faintness of the late - time afterglow and the steep post - injection decay may be explained if a jet break occurred on roughly the same timescale as the energy injection .    in comparison with other late - time afterglow studies @xcite , the radio flare and x - ray flattening observed for  are clearly atypical for long - duration grbs .",
    "we therefore attribute the observed evolution to an unusual scenario involving either a large circumburst density jump or a late - time injection of energy ( from a slow shell or off - axis ejecta ) .",
    "the _ hst _ measurements at late - time can be used to constrain any possible contribution from an associated supernova .",
    "based on previous studies of grb - sne , the thermal emission from an associated supernova is predicted to reach maximum light on a timescale of @xmath193 days with a peak magnitude of @xmath194 mag or fainter ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "observationally , the emergence of a sn component produces a steepening of the optical spectrum as the supernova nears maximum light and dominates the afterglow emission .",
    "an extrapolation of the broadband afterglow model to @xmath195 days shows that the _ hst _ data are brighter by a factor of @xmath196 . for comparison ,",
    "the radio flare and x - ray plateau on this same timescale represent flux density enhancements by factors of roughly @xmath22 and 2 , respectively .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : hst ] we measure the spectrum of the optical transient within the _ acs _ bands and find @xmath197 at 37 days .",
    "after correction for extinction ( see  [ sec : optical ] ) , the implied spectral index becomes @xmath198 . for comparison ,",
    "the spectral index between the radio and x - ray bands on this timescale ( coincident with the radio flare and x - ray flattening ) is @xmath199 and the indices within the bands are @xmath200 ( figure  [ fig : vla_lt_curve ] ) and @xmath201 @xcite , respectively . given that the _ hst _ derived spectral index , even after correction for extinction , is ( 1 ) significantly steeper than the nir / optical index observed at early time , @xmath202 , ( 2 ) significantly steeper than @xmath203 measured at a comparable epoch , and ( 3 ) inconsistent with the range of synchrotron spectral indices predicted for a relativistic blastwave ( @xmath204 $ ] , @xcite ) , we conclude that the optical flux at @xmath6 days is dominated by another emission process , likely an associated sn .    next , to determine if the late - time optical data are consistent with the temporal evolution of a typical grb / xrf - associated supernova , we compare the _ hst _ flux values with synthesized sn light - curves .",
    "we compiled _ ubvrijhk _ observations of sn1998bw from the literature @xcite and smoothed the extinction - corrected ( galactic component of e(b - v)=0.059 , @xcite ) light - curves . here",
    "we assume that the sn1998bw host - galaxy extinction is negligible , consistent with the findings of @xcite based on a spectroscopic analysis of the host galaxy .",
    "we then produced @xmath205-corrected nir / optical light - curves of sn1998bw at the redshift of xrf050416a by interpolating over the photometric spectrum and stretching the arrival time of the photons by a factor of @xmath206 .",
    "shown in figure  [ fig : niropt_model_ltcurves2 ] are the synthesized light - curves for sn1998bw at @xmath0 , summed together with the afterglow model .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "data are roughly comparable with the flux normalization and evolution of the summed model . therefore ,",
    "the temporal and spectral properties of the _ hst _ data suggest that xrf050416a was associated with a supernova similar to sn1998bw . however , we caution that the temporal coincidence of the sn peak with the radio flare makes it difficult to estimate the relative contributions of the sn and afterglow .",
    "we now turn to the properties of the grb host galaxy .",
    "we measure the brightness of the host galaxy in the final _ hst _ epoch to be f775w@xmath207 mag ( @xmath208 mag ) .",
    "these values are not corrected for extinction . at @xmath0",
    "the rest - frame @xmath209-band is traced by the observed f775w band , leading to an absolute magnitude , @xmath210 mag , or a luminosity @xmath211 .",
    "this host luminosity is similar to that inferred for xrf030528 @xcite and the hosts of typical grbs @xcite . at @xmath0 , the measured offset of the optical transient (  [ sec : optical ] ) relative to the center of the host galaxy corresponds to @xmath212 pc .",
    "this offset is a factor of @xmath13 smaller than the median value for long - duration grbs @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : lris_spec ] , the host exhibits several emission lines typical of star - forming galaxies .",

    "we note that the observed ratio of h@xmath68/h@xmath47 @xmath222 compared to the theoretical value of about @xmath223 @xcite suggests a significant extinction correction ( factor of @xmath13 ) following the method of @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the star formation rate for the host of xrf050416a is similar to those inferred for long - duration grbs @xcite and at least an order of magnitude larger than that inferred for xrf020903 @xcite .",
    "the combination of the inferred star formation rate and host luminosity provides a measure of the specific star formation rate .",
    "we find a value of @xmath224 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 @xmath225*/@xmath225 ( uncorrected for extinction ) , which is about a factor of two lower than the mean specific star formation rate for the hosts of long - duration grbs @xcite .",

    "we find that for the upper branch the metallicity is @xmath228 while for the lower branch it is about 7.9 ; the two branches are due to the double - valued nature of @xmath229 in terms of metallicity .",
    "thus , the host metallicity of  is @xmath230 @xmath11 , larger than that inferred for xrf060218 @xcite and comparable to that for xrf030528 @xcite .",
    "moreover , this range is somewhat higher than the typical metallicities for grb hosts , some of which have metallicities that are @xmath231 solar ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "with a prompt emission duration of just t@xmath232 sec @xcite , it is interesting to consider  as a member of the short - hard class of gamma - ray bursts , popularly believed to result from the coalescence of neutron stars or black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the bi - modal batse duration distribution , bursts with @xmath233 seconds are assumed to belong to the long - duration class @xcite , although a decomposition of the overlapping distributions suggests that a small fraction of short - hard bursts ( shbs ) have durations longer than this cut - off .",
    "the distinction between short - hard and long - duration bursts is further complicated by the detection of soft x - ray tails lasting several seconds following shbs 050709 and 050724 @xcite .",

    "related to this issue is the use of spectral lags to distinguish between long and short bursts . as discussed by @xcite , long - duration bursts typically have longer lags that correlate with isotropic equivalent prompt gamma - ray luminosity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "shbs have negligible ( or even negative ) spectral lags .    in the case of , the prompt duration places it between the long- and short - duration classes .",

    "afterglow modeling may provide additional clues .",

    "this event highlights the difficulty in classifying bursts based on their prompt emission properties alone .",

    "these values are a factor of @xmath89 times larger than those of xrf020903 @xcite and up to @xmath235 times larger than those inferred for sub - energetic grbs 980425 , 031203 and xrf060218 @xcite .    adopting the results of our standard synchrotron model and @xmath240 days we constrain the collimation of the ejecta to @xmath241 , slightly larger than the median value of @xmath242 for typical grbs ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this indicates that the beaming - corrected energy release is @xmath243 erg and @xmath244 ) erg , implying a total relativistic energy yield of @xmath245 erg , which straddles the median value for cosmological grbs , @xmath246 erg @xcite .",
    "however , the efficiency in converting the energy in the ejecta into @xmath68-rays is @xmath247 , significantly lower than the typical values for grbs @xcite and comparable to that inferred for xrf020903 ( @xmath248 , @xcite ) .",
    "this strengthens the idea that xrfs and grbs are distinguished by their ability to couple significant energy to highly - relativistic material @xcite .",
    "in addition to the burst energetics , several key results emerge from our broadband analysis of .",
    "first is the detection of a bright , late - time radio flare accompanied by an observed flattening in the x - ray bands which we attribute to a large circumburst density enhancement or episode of energy injection ( refreshing shell or off - axis ejecta ) at @xmath3 days . in the context of a density jump , it is interesting to note that the inferred pre - jump circumburst density is several orders of magnitude lower than the values typically inferred for long - duration grbs ( see @xcite for a recent compilation ) .",
    "moreover , radio observations of local ( optically - selected ) core - collapse sne show similar flux modulations ( factor of 2 to 3 ) attributed to abrupt variations in the circumstellar medium @xcite .",
    "next , the temporal and spectral evolution of the optical afterglow suggests the contribution from a supernova component with peak luminosity and light - curve shape comparable to sn1998bw .",
    "given the temporal coincidence of the radio flare and x - ray flattening with the sn peak ,  highlights the need for full spectral coverage in late - time grb / xrf - sn searches .",
    "this is illustrated by the optical rebrightening observed for xrf030723 at @xmath249 days and interpretted as a thermal sn component @xcite while the x - ray and radio data show similar rebrightenings at late - time suggesting a csm density jump or energy injection ( @xcite , soderberg _ et al . _ in prep ) .    with the addition of , there are three xrfs ( 020903 , 060218 and now 050416a ) with spectroscopic redshifts observed in association with supernovae with peak luminosities varying by up to a factor of 10 compared to sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "however , deep _ hst _",
    "observations of xrf040701 at @xmath250 revealed that any associated sn was at least a factor of 10 ( and likely @xmath251 ) times fainter than sn1998bw @xcite .",
    "it is therefore clear that most xrfs produce nickel - rich supernova explosions , but that there is a significant dispersion in the peak luminosities of xrf - associated sne .",
    "a similar result is found for grb - associated sne @xcite and further strengthens the idea that grbs and xrfs are intimately related .",
    "finally , we address  within the framework of off - axis and dirty fireball models for xrfs . as discussed in  [ sec : jet ] , the evolution of the early afterglow indicates that the ejecta are being viewed along the collimation axis .",
    "similarly , on - axis viewing angles are inferred from afterglow studies of xrfs 020903 @xcite , 050215b @xcite , 050406 @xcite , and 060218 @xcite .",
    "unification models in which x - ray flashes are understood as typical grbs viewed away from the burst collimation axis ( e.g. @xcite ) are therefore inconsistent with the observations for these five events . to date ,",
    "such models are only consistent with the observations of one x - ray flash : xrf030723 @xcite .",
    "while the lack of high energy photons prevents a direct constraint on the lorentz factor of the burst , our detailed afterglow modeling allows us to place a lower limit on the initial bulk lorentz factor , @xmath252 , by extrapolating @xmath253 back to the first xrt observation at @xmath76 sec .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than the typical values inferred for cosmological grbs @xcite and consistent with the upper range of values predicted for a dirty fireball .",
    "given that some dirty fireball models predict xrfs to have wider jets than typical grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is interesting to note that there are no x - ray flashes for which an achromatic jet break has been observed .",
    "this may suggest that their ejecta are not strongly collimated .",
    "in fact , detailed radio observations of xrfs 020903 and 060218 spanning @xmath251 days imply a quasi - spherical ejecta geometry in both cases @xcite .    while the basic properties of x - ray flashes ( redshifts , hosts , isotropic @xmath68-ray energies ) are now available for several events , it is clear that broadband afterglow observations are required for a complete understanding of the burst properties . with the addition of  to the existing sample of only a few well - studied events",
    ", we continue to work towards a systematic comparison of the global characteristics of xrfs and grbs . while limited , the current sample suggests that the two classes share similar ejecta energies , associated sne , and viewing angles .",

    "<S> we present detailed optical , near - infrared , and radio observations of the x - ray flash 050416a obtained with palomar and siding springs observatories as well as the _ hubble space telescope _ and very large array , placing this event among the best - studied x - ray flashes to date . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we present an optical spectrum from keck lris from which we measure the redshift of the burst , @xmath0 . at this redshift </S>",
    "<S> the isotropic - equivalent prompt energy release was about @xmath1 erg , and using a standard afterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy is a factor of 10 larger , @xmath2 erg . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of an observed jet break to @xmath3 days indicates that the opening angle is @xmath4 and the total beaming - corrected relativistic energy is @xmath5 erg . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the burst produced a strong radio flare at @xmath6 days accompanied by an observed flattening in the x - ray band which we attribute to an abrupt circumburst density jump or an episode of energy injection ( either from a refreshed shock or off - axis ejecta ) . </S>",
    "<S> late - time observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ show evidence for an associated supernova with peak optical luminosity roughly comparable to that of sn1998bw . </S>",
    "<S> next , we show that the host galaxy of xrf050416a is actively forming stars at a rate of at least 2 m@xmath7 yr@xmath8 with a luminosity of @xmath9 and metallicity of @xmath10 @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the nature of  in the context of short - hard gamma - ray bursts and under the framework of off - axis and dirty fireball models for x - ray flashes . </S>"
