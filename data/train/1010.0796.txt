    "in many studies , the response of interest is not a random variable but a noisy function for each experimental unit , resulting in a sample of curves . in such studies ,",

    "the unknown error terms @xmath7 are independent zero mean random variables with variance @xmath8",
    ".    the sample of individual regression curves will show a certain homogeneity in structure , in the sense that curves coincide if they are properly scaled and shifted .",

    "this semiparametric model was introduced by lawton , sylvestre and maggio  @xcite under the name of shape invariant model .",
    "we have both a finite - dimensional parameter ( @xmath15 ) and an infinite - dimensional nuisance parameter @xmath14 which is a member of some given large set of functions .",
    "a general feature of semiparametric methods is to `` eliminate '' the nonparametric component @xmath14 , thus reducing the original semiparametric problem to a suitably chosen parametric one .",
    "such models have been used to study child growth curves ( see @xcite ) or to improve a forecasting methodology @xcite based on speed data of vehicles on a main trunk road ( see @xcite for more details ) . since the common shape is assumed to be periodic , the model is particularly well adapted for the study of circadian rhythms ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our model and our estimation method are illustrated with the daily temperature of several cities .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to present a method for the efficient estimation of the parameter ( @xmath15 ) without knowing @xmath16 the question of estimation of parameters for the shape invariant model was studied by several authors .",

    "thus the notions of tangent space and of differentiability of the parameter ( @xmath15 ) are used in order to specify the characteristics of an efficient estimator . under the assumptions listed in theorem",

    "this follows the conclusions of murphy and van der vaart @xcite : semiparemetric profile likelihoods , where the nuisance parameter has been profiled out , behave like ordinary likelihoods in that they have a quadratic expansion .",

    "the rate of the regression function estimator is the optimal rate in nonparametric estimation @xcite , chapter 24 .",
    "using the theory developed by mcneney and wellner @xcite , we discuss its efficiency : the estimator is asymptotically linear . but the fourier coefficients estimators are efficient if and only if the common shape @xmath14 is odd or even . even if this condition is satisfied , we can not deduce that the estimator of @xmath14 is efficient because it is not regular .",
    "this work is related to @xcite , chapter  3 , where we propose another criterion which allows us to estimate efficiently the parameter ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this criterion , which is similar by its definition to the criterion proposed by gamboa , loubes and maza @xcite and  @xcite , chapter  2 , allows us to build a test procedure for the model .",

    "the data @xmath21 are the observations of @xmath22 curves at the observation times @xmath23 we assume that each curve is observed at the same set of equidistant points @xmath24 the choice of the observation times @xmath25 is related with the choice of quadrature formula ( see remark  [ remq : quadrature : formula ] ) .",

    "are independent standard gaussian random variables .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we get a common variance @xmath29 however , all our results are still valid for a general variance .",
    "the model is semiparametric : @xmath30 is the finite - dimensional parameter and @xmath14 is the nuisance parameter .",
    "our aim is to estimate efficiently the internal shift @xmath31 , the scale parameter @xmath32 and the external shift @xmath33 without knowing either the shape @xmath14 or the noise level @xmath34 .",

    ", we have to study the uniqueness of their definition .",
    "indeed , the shape invariant model has some inherent unidentifiability : for a given parameter @xmath36 and a shape function @xmath37 we can always find another parameter @xmath38 and another shape function @xmath39 such that @xmath40 holds for all @xmath41 .",
    "then we assume that the true parameters lie in the following spaces : @xmath42 the constraint on the common shape allows us to uniquely define the parameter @xmath43 , @xmath44 and to build asymptotically independent estimators ( see remark  [ rq : identifiability : constraint ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath45 is a user - defined ( strictly positive ) parameter which reflects our prior knowledge on the level parameter .",
    "the constraints @xmath46 and @xmath47 mean that the first unit ( @xmath48 ) is taken as `` reference '' to estimate the shift parameter and the scale parameter . at last",
    ", the constraint @xmath49 means that the common shape is defined as the weighted sum of the regression functions @xmath5 ( [ model : general ] ) .",
    "this condition is well adapted to our estimation criterion ( see the next paragraph on the profile likelihood ) .      maximizing the likelihood function",
    "directly is not possible for higher - dimensional parameters , and fails particularly for semiparametric models .",
    "frequently , this problem is overcome by using a profile likelihood rather than a full likelihood .",
    "if @xmath50 is the full @xmath51-likelihood , then the profile likelihood for @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 the maximum likelihood estimator for @xmath54 , the first component of the pair @xmath55 that maximizes @xmath50 , is the maximizer of the profile likelihood function @xmath56 .",
    "thus we maximize the likelihood in two steps . with the assumptions on the model , we shall use the gaussian @xmath51-likelihood , @xmath57    generally , the problem of minimization on a large set is solved by the consideration of a parametric subset . here",
    ", the semiparametric problem is reduced to a parametric one : @xmath58 is approximated by its truncated fourier series .",
    "thus the profile likelihood is approximated by minimizing the likelihood @xmath59 on a subset of trigonometric polynomials .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath60 be an increasing integer s sequence , and let @xmath61 be the subspace of @xmath62 of trigonometric polynomials whose degree is less than @xmath63 in order to preserve the orthogonality of the discrete fourier basis , @xmath64 we choose @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that @xmath67 after some computations , the likelihood maximum is reached in the space @xmath61 by the trigonometric polynomial @xmath68 where for @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 finally , using the orthogonality of the discrete fourier basis , the following equality holds : @xmath72 where @xmath73 let @xmath74 be the function of @xmath75 defined as @xmath76 with the identifiability constraints of the model , the profile log - likelihood @xmath77 is equal to @xmath78    [ remq : quadrature : formula ] the estimation method requires the estimation of the fourier coefficients of the common shape .",
    "a natural approach for estimating an integral is to use a quadrature formula which is associated with the observation times @xmath79 in this paper , the observation times are equidistant .",
    "therefore the quadrature formula is the well - known newton ",
    "cotes formula .",
    "even if another choice of the observation times is possible ( see @xcite , chapter  2 ) , this formula defines the discrete fourier coefficients @xmath80 which are an accurate approximation of @xmath81 : @xmath82 moreover , the stochastic part of the coefficients ( [ likelihood : coefficients ] ) are linear combinations of the complex variables @xmath83 @xmath84 due to cochran s theorem , these variables are independent centered complex gaussian variables whose the variance is equal to @xmath85 this property is related to the convergence rate of the estimators ( see @xcite , chapter  2 , for more details , and @xcite to compare ) .",
    "consequently , the maximum likelihood estimator of the finite - dimensional parameter is defined as @xmath86 then , the estimators of the common shape are the trigonometric polynomials , which maximize the likelihood when @xmath87 : @xmath88 first , we study the consistency of the estimator of ( @xmath15 ) .",
