    "reactions between ions and simple molecules have been invoked in the chemistry of comets  @xcite , dense interstellar clouds  @xcite , as well as in the atmospheric chemistry of planet - like objects , such as io  @xcite and titan  @xcite . since the late 1990s ,",
    "the na@xmath1x collisions ( with x an atmospheric ligand ) have been recognized to be responsible for the formation of sporadic sodium layers in earth s upper mesosphere  @xcite .",
    "the species that take part in the reactions in the upper atmosphere and in interstellar space are exposed to electromagnetic radiation of varying intensity .",
    "when polarized , this radiation may create directional molecular states in which the spatial distribution of the molecular axis is itself polarized .",
    "this axis polarization arises from the nonresonant interaction of the radiation with the anisotropic molecular polarizability @xcite . here",
    "we examine how such polarization may affect the differential and integral cross sections of the ion - molecule collisions .",
    "in particular , we investigate the effect of an intense nonresonant radiative field on the rotationally inelastic collisions of na@xmath2 ions with n@xmath3 molecules at ev collision energies .",
    "this collision system is of paramount importance in generating sporadic sodium in the mesosphere  @xcite .    in our investigation , we make use of a recently developed quantum model of collisions in fields @xcite , which we here adapt for the case of an induced - dipole interaction of a nonresonant radiative field with molecular polarizability @xcite .",
    "we limit our considerations to the scattering of @xmath4 molecules by ground - state atomic ions .",
    "the model is based on fraunhofer scattering of matter waves @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and is analytic in both its field - free and field - dependent variant .    in section",
    "[ sec : fraunapprox ] , we briefly describe the fraunhofer model of matter - wave scattering and its extension to the case of scattering in nonresonant radiative fields . in section  [ sec",
    ": na - n2 ] , we apply the model to the @xmath0 rotationally inelastic collisions , and evaluate their differential and integral cross sections and the steric asymmetry as a function of the intensity of the radiative field .",
    "the main conclusions of this work are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "inherent to the fraunhofer model of matter - wave scattering is the energy sudden approximation and the assumption of an impenetrable , sharp - edged scatterer @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the fraunhofer amplitude for scattering into an angle @xmath5 from an initial , @xmath6 , to a final , @xmath7 , state is given by @xmath8 with @xmath9 the amplitude for fraunhofer diffraction as observed at a point of radiusvector @xmath10 from the scatterer , see fig .",

    "@xmath11 is the polar angle of the radius vector @xmath12 which traces the shape of the scatterer , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 with @xmath15 the initial wave vector .",

    "[ fig : fraunhofer ] .",
    "we note that the notion of a sharp - edged scatterer comes close to the rigid - shell approximation , widely used in classical  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , quantum  @xcite , and quasi - quantum  @xcite treatments of field - free molecular collisions , where the collision energy by far exceeds the depth of any potential energy well .",
    "in optics , fraunhofer ( i.e. , far - field ) diffraction  @xcite occurs when the fresnel number is small , @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the dimension of the obstacle , @xmath21 is the distance from the obstacle to the observer , and @xmath22 is the wavelength , cf . fig .",

    "this interaction , governed by the molecular polarizability , results in an induced dipole moment .",
    "while for the experimentally feasible static fields such induced moments are very weak , sizable dipole moments can be induced by a radiative field .",
    "if the induced - dipole interaction is anisotropic and sufficiently strong , the molecular rotational states undergo _ hybridization _ ( coherent linear superposition ) which aligns the molecular axis along the field vector  @xcite .",

    "the degree of alignment depends on the values of @xmath65 , @xmath55 , and @xmath48 . in such states ,",
    "the molecular axis librates about the field direction like a pendulum , and so the hybrid states are referred to as _ pendular_. it is the directionality of the pendular states that enters the field - dependent fraunhofer model and distinguishes it from the field - free model , which assumes an isotropic distribution of the molecular axes .",
    "the directional properties of pendular states are exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : pendstate ] , which shows polar diagrams of both field - free and pendular wave functions at @xmath70 .",

    "this pendular state may be changed by the collision in the field into another pendular state , @xmath72 .",
    "as the molecule leaves the field , the latter pendular state is adiabatically transformed into a free - rotor state @xmath73 .",

    "furthermore , if we fix the initial molecular state to the ground state , @xmath84 , and restrict the polarization of the radiation in the space - fixed frame to a particular geometry , the problem simplifies as follows :    \\(i ) for a polarization vector _ collinear _ with the initial wave vector , @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 , @xmath87 . as as result , only the @xmath88 term yields a nonvanishing contribution and so @xmath89 we see that the angular dependence of the scattering amplitude for the parallel case is simple , given by a single bessel function , @xmath90 .",

    "we can also see that , for either geometry , only the partial cross sections for the @xmath98 collisions with @xmath99 even contribute to the scattering .",
