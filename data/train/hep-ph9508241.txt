    "after the celebrated discovery of the top quark @xcite , the higgs boson is the last missing link in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the detection of this particle and the study of its characteristics are among the prime objectives of present and future high - energy colliding - beam experiments .",
    "following bjorken s proposal @xcite , the higgs boson is currently being searched for with the cern large electron - positron collider ( lep1 ) and the slac linear collider ( slc ) via @xmath20 . at the present time",
    ", the failure of this search allows one to rule out the mass range @xmath21  gev at the 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "the quest for the higgs boson will be continued with lep2 by exploiting the higgs - strahlung mechanism @xcite , @xmath22 . in next - generation @xmath5 linear supercolliders ( nlc ) ,",
    "also @xmath23 via @xmath24 fusion and , to a lesser extent , @xmath25 via @xmath26 fusion will provide copious sources of higgs bosons .",
    "once a novel scalar particle is discovered , it will be crucial to decide if it is the very higgs boson of the sm or if it lives in some more extended higgs sector . to that end , precise knowledge of the sm predictions",
    "will be mandatory , _",
    "i.e. _ , quantum corrections must be taken into account .",
    "the status of the radiative corrections to the production and decay processes of the sm higgs boson has recently been summarized @xcite .",
    "since the top quark is by far the heaviest established elementary particle , with a pole mass of @xmath27  gev @xcite , the leading high-@xmath28 terms , of @xmath15 , are particularly important , and it is desirable to acquire information on their quantumchromodynamical ( qcd ) corrections . during the last year , a number of papers have appeared in which the two - loop @xmath14 corrections to various higgs - boson production and decay processes are presented .",
    "these processes include @xmath29 , with @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath23 via @xmath24 fusion @xcite , @xmath32 @xcite , and more @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall take the next step and tackle with three - loop @xmath0 corrections . to keep matters as simple as possible",
    ", we shall restrict our considerations to light higgs bosons , with @xmath33 , and to reactions with colourless particles in the initial and final states .",
    "such reactions typically involve the @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 couplings together with gauge couplings of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 bosons to leptons .",
    "we are thus led to incorporate the next - to - leading qcd corrections in the low-@xmath36 effective @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 interaction lagrangians .",
    "this will be achieved in section  2 .",
    "recently , the @xmath0 correction to @xmath4 has been calculated and found to be sizeable @xcite .",
    "this is relevant for present and future precision tests of the standard electroweak theory .",
    "it is of great theoretical interest to find out whether the occurrence of significant @xmath0 corrections is specific to @xmath4 or whether this is a common feature in the class of electroweak observables with a quadratic @xmath28 dependence at one loop . in the latter case",
    ", there must be some underlying principle which is able to explain this phenomenon .",
    "our analysis will put us into a position where we can investigate this matter for four independent quantities .",
    "we shall return to this issue in section  5 .",
    "the complete evaluation of the one - loop electroweak correction to a process which involves more than four external particles is enormously intricate . to our knowledge",
    ", the literature does not contain a single example of such a calculation .",
    "however , the so - called improved born approximation ( iba ) @xcite allows us to conveniently extract at least the dominant fermionic loop corrections . as a by - product of our analysis",
    ", we shall illustrate the usefulness of the iba for higgs - boson production and decay in high - energy @xmath5 collisions .",
    "the appropriate formalism will be developed in section  3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we shall extend the low-@xmath36 effective @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 interaction lagrangians to @xmath0 . in the @xmath12 formulation of the electroweak on - shell scheme , knowledge of the qcd - corrected @xmath3 coupling",
    "is sufficient to control the related four- and five - point higgs - boson production and decay processes which emerge by connecting one or both of the @xmath34 bosons with lepton lines , respectively .",
    "contrariwise , the corresponding processes involving a @xmath2 coupling receive additional qcd corrections from the gauge sector , which we shall evaluate by invoking the iba in section  3 . in section  4",
    ", we shall quantitatively analyze the phenomenological consequences of our results .",
    "section  5 contains our conclusions .",
    "throughout this paper , we shall work in the electroweak on - shell renormalization scheme @xcite , with @xmath12 as a basic parameter , and define @xmath37 @xcite .",

    "the self - energies of the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and higgs bosons to @xmath0 for zero external four - momentum squared will be the basic ingredients of our analysis .",
    "while the results for the @xmath34 and @xmath35 bosons are now well established @xcite , the higgs - boson self - energy requires a separate analysis , which will be performed here .",

    "we shall suppress terms containing @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is euler s constant .",
    "these terms may be retrieved by substituting @xmath44 . in the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath13 ) scheme @xcite ,",
    "these terms are subtracted along with the poles in @xmath45 .",
    "this is also true for the relation between the @xmath13 and pole masses of the quarks , so that these terms are also absent when the quark masses are renormalized according to the on - shell scheme . since we wish to extract the leading high-@xmath28 terms , we may neglect the masses of all virtual particles , except for the top quark . as usual",
    ", we shall take @xmath46 to be anticommuting for @xmath47 arbitrary .",
    "we shall choose a covariant gauge with an arbitrary gauge parameter for the gluon propagator .",
    "this will allow us to explicitly check that our final results are gauge independent .",
    "the requirement that the expressions for physical observables be renormalization - group ( rg ) invariant will serve as a further check for our calculation .    large intermediate expressions will be treated with the help of form 2.0 @xcite .",
    "the tadpole integrals which enter the one- and two - loop calculations may be solved straightforwardly , even for arbitrary powers of propagators .",
    "the three - loop case is more involved . after evaluating the traces ,",
    "the scalar integrals may be reduced by decomposing the scalar products in the numerator into appropriate combinations of the factors in the denominator .",
