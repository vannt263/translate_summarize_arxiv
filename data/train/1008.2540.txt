    "for a gauge system like general relativity , there exist two ways of quantizing .",
    "( i ) the dirac method @xcite starts with quantization of all the degrees of freedom of the configuration space of e.g. the hilbert - einstein action .",
    "then the gauge freedom is removed from the quantum theory by solving the constraint operator equation . on the other hand , ( ii ) the reduced phase space method ( see e.g. @xcite ) begins with canonical formulation of the classical theory and then the gauge freedom is removed by identification of all dirac s observables through the following weak equality : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a constraint , @xmath4 is a dirac s observable and the equality is weak in the sense that it holds on the constraint surface @xmath5 ( it excludes the solutions of the type @xmath6 ) .",
    "then the dirac observables , which are physical degrees of freedom , are mapped into quantum operators .    in this paper",
    "we take yet another route : we remove the gauge freedom already at the level of lagrangian .",
    "then we move to a hamiltonian formulation and subsequently we quantize the canonical system using the schrdinger representation . the analysis is restricted to the compact , flat frw universe .    in section [ ct ] , starting with a given lagrangian , we show that it describes the system under consideration and arrive at canonical formulation in convenient basic variables . in section [ sq ] ,",
    "we map the phase space functions into operators and study their self - adjointness .",
    "next , in section [ eoevopc ] we compute the evolution of mean values of the relevant operators .",
    "we conclude in section [ d ] .    in appendix [ rp ]",
    "we make conjecture that the reduced phase space method is closely related to the reduced lagrangian method .    in appendix [ b ]",
    "we report on an unsuccessful attempt at resolving the singularity . it is discussed and compared with approach used throughout this paper in concluding section [ d ] .",
    "the metric of the flat frw universe in the comoving coordinates and with respect to the cosmological time @xmath7 reads : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a scale factor and @xmath10 is a distance measure in a space - like leaf @xmath11 . instead of the scale factor @xmath12 , we are going to consider the dynamics of the physical length between two unspecified points in @xmath11 and we denote it by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the length at the moment @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , for each value of @xmath7 , the length @xmath16 is a physical quantity , i.e. the dirac observable .",
    "now let us see how one can introduce the dynamics of @xmath17 .",
    "let us examine the following action integral : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a constant of the length dimension and will be specified later .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is a real constant .",
    "variation with respect to @xmath17 gives the equation of motion : @xmath21 which has the solutions : @xmath22 satisfying the initial conditions : @xmath23 let us turn to the friedman equations : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is hubble s parameter , @xmath26 is the energy density and @xmath27 is the pressure of the matter in the universe .",
    "now , making use of @xmath28 , we find out that : @xmath29 and we easily conclude that our system given by the action integral ( [ action ] ) is the flat frw universe with @xmath30 and @xmath0 .    hence , we have succeeded in the gauge - fixed lagrangian formulation of the dynamics of the flat frw universe filled with matter satisfying the equation of state @xmath0 .",
    "the connection of this reduced lagrangian with the reduced phase space procedure , which begins with the introduction of the kinematical phase space ( consisting of both gauge and physical degrees of freedom ) , is commented in appendix [ rp ] .",
    "the energy of matter contained in a fiducial cubic cell of the edge length changing with time as @xmath16 , reads : @xmath31 and , for @xmath32 , is clearly not conserved .",
    "for instance , the matter may consist of particles , which move with respect to the comoving reference frame , then the particles loose / gain their kinetic energy as the spacetime expands / shrinks and the energy of matter changes with the evolution of the universe .",
    "however , one may introduce a conserved quantity , the total energy : @xmath33 which is equal to the energy of matter at the moment when the value of the length of the fiducial cubic cell is equal to @xmath20 . if the moment happens to be @xmath15 , then @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "we perform the legendre transformation : @xmath36 so that @xmath37 hamilton s equations : @xmath38 can be integrated and we obtain : @xmath39 where @xmath3 is any real constant .",
    "the solutions split into three cases : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "they respectively correspond to the momentum of space blowing up , being constant and vanishing as the universe approaches the singularity @xmath43 .",
    "we are going to study physically interesting quantities like hubble s parameter or energy density , which take the following form , respectively : @xmath44 the hamiltonian @xmath45 is a conserved quantity like the total energy of the system defined in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) .",
    "the comparison of these two leads to the condition : @xmath46 and hence @xmath47 which is in accordance with our prior definition and explains the physical meaning of @xmath20 .      in what follows",
    "we will look for a more convenient conjugate pair .",
    "we assume that :    1 .",
    "the canonical transformation is valid globally 2 .   the stationary universes in ( [ sol1 ] ) are included in the system and thus well - mapped by the transformation 3 .",
    "canonical transformation does not extend the phase space , in particular it preserves the topology of the phase space under consideration    now , let us break the above rules in the following example : @xmath48 the map is singular for @xmath49 and thus the stationary universes being the points at the axis @xmath49 , are excluded now .",
    "instead , the closure of the range of the map covers a new region of the space of parameters , @xmath50 . as a consequence , the trajectories in the phase space are complete and the singularities are absent ! but this is not a good way to resolve the singularity , since , apart from the lack of quantum physics , the procedure has a drawback in that it is non - unique and here are further examples : @xmath51 therefore , making use of a ` regular ' map , we introduce the following new canonical pair : @xmath52 now , the hamiltonian reads : @xmath53 the hubble parameter : @xmath54 the energy density : @xmath55 and the length : @xmath56",
    "in the schrdinger representation : @xmath57 and we get the following formally self - adjoint operators that are relevant in the cosmological context and will be studied below : @xmath58 the range of @xmath59 is @xmath60 . thus , the problem of evolution across singularity is formulated in terms of a freely moving quantum particle on a half - line .",
    "the theory of the operator @xmath61 on half - line may be found in @xcite . in short , there are infinitely many ways , in which one may define the operator @xmath62 to be essentially self - adjoint on @xmath63 and we will denote these options by @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to the neumann and dirichlet conditions , respectively . ] . in order to calculate the evolution of a given state one may apply the appropriate fourier transform , denoted by @xmath67 , and multiply the resultant wave - function by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the momentum .",
    "the important point to be made here is that we * do * introduce an evolution operator . in the quantization scheme proposed in @xcite , one only quantizes the dirac observables enumerated by a classical evolution parameter - one does not introduce a generator of change in this parameter , called the true hamiltonian , in order to quantize it .",
    "however , in our model of universe this approach would not work - it would not give any sensible solution to the singularity problem .",
    "the crucial difference is that in the model presented in @xcite the classical dynamics was already non - singular , whereas in the model considered here the dynamics ends at the point @xmath43 .",
    "the quantization of the evolution may give some hopes to resolve the singularity .",
    "the following heuristic argument shows that the closer to the singularity the more the quantum universe departures from the classical one : @xmath70 & \\sim &    -2\\hat{h}^2+\\frac{1}{2}x^{-4}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we observe that at the classical level ( [ cl ] ) the value of the hubble parameter @xmath25 goes to minus infinity as the universe approaches the singularity , whereas at the quantum level ( [ qu ] ) the term @xmath71 opposes the unbounded decrease of the operator @xmath72 . from the form of @xmath72 given in ( [ h ] )",
    ", one sees that the ` closer ' the wave - function to @xmath73 , the bigger the value of @xmath74 .",
    "but at the same time , the closer the wave - function to @xmath73 , the bigger the value of the opposing term @xmath71 .      we will study the formally self - adjoint hubble operator : @xmath75 let us consider the following inverse mapping @xmath76 : @xmath77 let us see that this mapping is isometric , and hence unitary : @xmath78 application of the mapping ( [ isomap ] ) to the operator @xmath72 gives : @xmath79 which is a simple derivative operator .",
    "analogically , under the same mapping the energy density operator @xmath80 is transformed into laplacian @xmath81 .",
    "again , there are infinitely many inequivalent ways , in which one may define a self - adjoint @xmath80 , and we will denote these options by @xmath82 .",
    "however , the hubble operator , being a momentum operator , can not be self - adjoint on the half - line .",
    "therefore , we will redefine @xmath83 .",
    "the spectrum of these operators reads @xmath84 for any @xmath85 .",
    "the volume operator @xmath86 is a self - adjoint operator on @xmath87 and its spectrum for @xmath88 reads @xmath89 .",
    "let us restrict to the study of the evolution that preserves the dirichlet condition ( i.e. generated by @xmath64 for @xmath66 ) .",
    "we pick the following family of wave - functions : @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92=[x]^{-1}=m^{-\\frac{3w+3}{2}}$ ] , @xmath93=m^{3w+3}$ ] and evolve them in time : @xmath94 applying the fourier sine transform @xmath95 renders : @xmath96      let us calculate the expectation value of the operator corresponding to the classical invariant @xmath97{e_{tot}}$ ]  : @xmath98{e_{tot}}~\\rangle:=\\langle\\tilde{\\phi}_a(k)|\\sqrt[w+1]{\\hat{\\mathbb{h}}}~\\tilde{\\phi}_a(k)\\rangle=\\sqrt[w+1]{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{\\alpha}}|n|^2      \\int_0^{\\infty}e^{-2ak^2}k^{\\frac{2w+4}{w+1}}~dk\\\\ \\label{einv }      = \\sqrt[w+1]{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\alpha}\\bigg(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\gamma\\bigg(\\frac{5 + 3w}{2 + 2w}\\bigg)\\bigg)^{w+1 }      \\cdot\\frac{1}{a}}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it will turn out to be useful for linking the classical trajectories with quantum states @xmath99 .",
    "the expectation value for the volume operator for the state @xmath100 equals : @xmath101 one observes that at @xmath102 the volume acquires its minimal value @xmath103 let us study the asymptotic behavior in ( [ volume ] ) for @xmath104 : @xmath105 on the other hand , the classical solution in ( [ sol ] ) tells that the volume of the fiducial cubic cell with the edge @xmath17 evolves as : @xmath106 which for @xmath107 reads : @xmath108{\\frac{e_{tot}}{\\alpha}}\\bigg(\\frac{3w+3}{2}\\bigg)^{\\frac{2}{w+1}}t^{\\frac{2}{w+1}}.\\ ] ] the comparison of ( [ cv ] ) with ( [ qv ] ) gives the following relation : @xmath109 which is in accordance with ( [ einv ] ) , if we substitute @xmath110 for @xmath111{e_{tot}}\\rangle^{w+1}$ ] . plugging this relation into the formula ( [ volcrt ] )",
    "we find out that at the bounce the critical volume of the cubic cell reads : @xmath112{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{\\alpha e_{tot}}}~.\\ ] ] first , notice that @xmath113 depends only on the classical invariant of motion @xmath110 , so it does not depend on the particular moment of evolution of the classical universe , at which we calculate @xmath113 .",
    "next , notice that it is proportional to @xmath114{e_{tot}}}$ ] , hence _ _ the more massive the universe the smaller its critical size__. the formula ( [ v ] ) knows nothing about planck scale and combined with the knowledge of the early universe evolution , can lead to the bounds on the mass of the whole universe .    , @xmath115 .",
    "]      first we make use of the unitary mapping @xmath76 and map the state @xmath100 accordingly to ( [ isomap ] ) .",
    "we find : @xmath116 we assume that the action of @xmath72 and @xmath80 on @xmath117 preserves the dirichlet condition ( i.e. we set @xmath118 ) .",
    "we perform the fourier sine transform @xmath95 on @xmath119 : @xmath120 where @xmath121 and hence we have @xmath122 where @xmath123 . now , in the momentum representation ,",
    "the operators @xmath72 and @xmath80 are proportional to @xmath69 and @xmath124 , respectively . since the function ( [ psi2 ] ) for large @xmath69 behaves like @xmath125 only the operators @xmath126 such that @xmath127 for large @xmath69 , a constant @xmath3 and @xmath128 , are well defined on the states that we consider in the sense that : @xmath129 however , we can still consider the expectation values @xmath130 for operators @xmath131 .",
    "the reason is that the integral @xmath132 is convergent and since the states @xmath133 may be approximated by states from the domain of the operator @xmath134 up to arbitrary accuracy , the integral ( [ expval ] ) keeps the physical meaning of the expectation value of this operator .    in particular , we may obtain the integral formula for the expectation value of the hubble parameter ( but not the energy density ) : @xmath135 we have already learnt from the study of the volume that the bounce occurs for the states @xmath133 at @xmath102 , hence we may calculate the expectation value of the operator @xmath136 at the bounce : @xmath137 after plugging the value of @xmath12 from ( [ qini ] ) into ( [ hcrit ] ) , we have : @xmath138 one immediately sees that the value of hubble parameter at which the universe ` reverses ' is proportional to the total energy of this universe .",
    "therefore , _ the more massive the universe , the higher the value of @xmath139_. moreover , one may safely assume that the energy density at the bounce @xmath140 is proportional to the square of the total energy @xmath141 .    , @xmath115 .",
    "just after the big bounce the quantum universe is shown to expand faster than the classical one , @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the quantum universe seems to undergo a kind of inflationary phase . ]",
    "it is a very interesting conjecture to think that our phase space with the physical quantities like the hubble parameter and the hamiltonian is in one to one correspondence with the reduced phase space arising from the identification of dirac s observables in the full canonical gauge - symmetry formulation ( for a short comment see appendix [ rp ] ) .",
    "if so , then our hamiltonian corresponds to a true hamiltonian in the reduced phase space formulation .",
    "this conjecture is investigated in @xcite and a special attention is given to the freedom in fixing an evolution parameter .",
    "our analysis shows a way to resolve the singularities of classical theory .",
    "it started with a lagrangian that was free from gauge symmetries .",
    "the evolution parameter @xmath7 was treated as a real , absolute time in which the system evolves .",
    "this cosmological clock does not exist outside the universe and should be connected with some measurements or change that we observe on cosmological scales .",
    "nevertheless , no matter which quantization method one uses for a gauge system with a hamiltonian itself being a constraint , one needs an evolution parameter .",
    "we argue that the choice of the evolution parameter in such a way that the singularity occurs at its finite value is crucial .",
    "thus a popular free scalar field is not a good choice and we encourage the reader to go through appendix [ b ] to see this .    in our approach we managed to express the dynamics of the frw universe in terms of a freely - moving non - relativistic particle on half - line .",
    "the classical dynamics ends when the particle hits the boundary of half - line and the evolution parameter ( i.e. the cosmological time ) can not be extended beyond this moment .",
    "however , we can promote the hamiltonian to a self - adjoint operator in quantum theory . due to the stone theorem ,",
    "the self - adjoint hamiltonian can be exponentiated to a unitary operator , which gives the evolution of the system for the unbounded values of the evolution parameter .",
    "thus , the half - line of the cosmological time is extended to the whole real domain and the singularity is resolved .",
    "we have studied the evolution of quantum states @xmath99 , where @xmath143 .",
    "how much of the hilbert space is covered by @xmath144 ?",
    "we study this question and others concerning the evolution of unbounded operators @xmath80 and @xmath72 in @xcite .",
    "we observe in the evolution of the hubble parameter and the volume of the universe no fixed scale , and in particular planck scale is irrelevant .",
    "the critical values @xmath113 and @xmath139 depend on how massive the universe is in the classical phase of its evolution , which corresponds to the value of @xmath12 .",
    "however , we can calculate the value of @xmath145 at the bounce : @xmath146 which is clearly independent of the parameter @xmath12 , i.e. of a particular quantum state . although this quantity is energy dimensionally it is not the same with the energy of the system .",
    "notice that the mean value of energy of the system obtained in ( [ einv ] ) depends on a state via the value of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , ( [ funsca ] ) may signal the existence of some fundamental energy scale not connected with any particular universe .",
    "the existence of such scale may enable to fix the value @xmath147 .",
    "this brings us to the problem of determining the value of @xmath147 .",
    "first , notice that the choice of @xmath147 is connected with the choice of time and to this extent it is arbitrary .",
    "one may suspect that the study of the conjectured correspondence ( appendix [ rp ] ) may shed light on this issues and thus we postpone the investigation to @xcite .",
    "another indeterminacy of the system is connected with the fact the addition of a total derivative to the lagrangian in ( [ action ] ) leads to the same dynamics .",
    "more importantly , there is an infinite number of ways in which one may define the self - adjoint hamiltonian .",
    "we have restricted to a single choice , preserving the dirichlet condition .",
    "but other choices seem to be equally good and are studied in @xcite .",
    "i want to thank prof .",
    "w. piechocki for his comments and questions concerning the ideas presented in this paper .",
    "suppose one has constructed the reduced phase space equipped with the induced poisson bracket and a true hamiltonian @xmath148 . in principle , one may now construct an action integral , that is an integral of the lagrangian @xmath149 defined as a function of the dirac observables : @xmath150 where @xmath151 denote the canonical conjugates to @xmath152 ( notice that the number of the dirac observables is always even ) and @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , one may begin with a reduced form of lagrangian @xmath149 , which encodes the dynamics of the system in a gauge fixed in correspondence with @xmath148",
    ". this formulation should also enjoy a freedom in choice of evolution parameter , hence there should be a class of @xmath149 and a corresponding class of @xmath148 .",
    "the metric of frw universe reads : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is an evolution parameter .",
    "the choice of the shift function @xmath156 corresponds to the choice of the evolution parameter .",
    "the rest of the notation as well as the meaning of the variable @xmath17 used below were explained in section [ ct ] .      for the flat frw universe with massless scalar field the action reads ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath157 which leads to the euler - lagrange equations : @xmath158 to which the solutions in the cosmological time ( @xmath159 ) read : @xmath160{\\big(8\\pi g \\omega_1\\big)(t+t_0)},~~~~\\phi=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{24\\pi g } }",
    "\\ln(t+t_0)+\\frac{3\\omega_2}{\\sqrt{24\\pi g}}.\\ ] ]      the legendre transformation followed by dirac s analysis gives : @xmath161 where the phase space is 4d : @xmath162 , where @xmath163 , @xmath164 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath165 is a constraint and @xmath156 is a non - zero coefficient corresponding to the choice of gauge .",
    "let us look for the dirac observables via fixing the gauge @xmath166 and solving : @xmath167o_i=0.\\ ] ] we introduce the new geometrical variables @xmath168 so that the equation ( [ dir ] ) reads now : @xmath169o_i=0,\\ ] ] and the solutions are easily found to be : @xmath170 which are not independent on the constraint surface due to the identity @xmath171 and for which the poisson bracket is now modified as follows @xmath172 .",
    "so the complete set of independent elementary dirac observables consists of two elements , say @xmath173 and @xmath174 , satisfying the algebra : @xmath175 we redefine @xmath176 and @xmath177 , so that @xmath178 and we restrict the analysis to the ` expanding universe ' solutions @xmath179 and on the constraint surface we have @xmath180 . from ( [ phi ] ) we have that : @xmath181{8\\pi g \\omega_1e^{-3\\omega_2}}e^{\\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi      g}{3}}\\phi}.\\ ] ] this quantity is now the dirac observable for a fixed value of @xmath182 , since it does not depend on the value of @xmath7 that one ascribes to the moment of measurement .",
    "the evolution of length is defined as the flow through the parameter @xmath182 , which parameterizes the family of dirac s observables @xmath183 .",
    "let us identify the generator of the change in @xmath182 : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is arbitrary .",
    "how to get rid of this indeterminacy ?",
    "note that to parameterize the reduced phase space one needs two independent dirac s observables .",
    "the first choice was @xmath183 and what is to be the second ?",
    "let us obtain from ( [ phi ] ) the hubble parameter : @xmath186 so that @xmath187 where @xmath188 is arbitrary",
    ". now , comparing ( [ h1 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) , removes the indeterminacy and the true hamiltonian is @xmath189 .",
    "thus , instead of considering the whole family of @xmath183 and @xmath190 , which of course produce redundancy in parameterizing the reduced phase space , one fixes the value of @xmath182 and includes the @xmath191 as a dynamics generator .",
    "one only needs to include that : @xmath192 where @xmath193 .",
    "now , let us identify @xmath194 , the conjugate of @xmath183 : @xmath195 where @xmath185 is arbitrary but we put @xmath196 .",
    "now , let us collect the information on the system in the form convenient for quantization : @xmath197 where @xmath198 , we have dropped the index @xmath199 for convenience and thus @xmath17 , @xmath45 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the length , the hamiltonian , the hubble parameter and the energy density , respectively .",
    "we do the following canonical transformation : @xmath200 where the new canonical pair @xmath201 is also defined on @xmath202 and @xmath203 now , the schrdinger quantization , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , renders the following formally self - adjoint operators : @xmath206 let us consider the following unitary mapping : @xmath207 and we find that the hamiltonian operator in this new hilbert space reads : @xmath208 now we should ensure that the hamiltonian is a positive operator , but we will ignore it for it will not alter the fate of the singularity .",
    "now , we can obtain the evolution of wave - functions : @xmath209 hence the inverse mapping back to the start hilbert space gives : @xmath210 now , we are ready to study the evolution of the expectation value of @xmath80 : @xmath211 and the expectation value of @xmath212 : @xmath213 the classical behavior is reproduced in the quantum theory , which includes the unbounded growth of energy density and the vanishing size of the universe",
    ".    one may think that this shows that the singularity can not be resolved in the above system .",
    "in fact , however , the singularity problem was not addressed at all due to the peculiar choice of the evolution parameter @xmath182 . in order to study",
    "the structure of the singularity one has to ensure that the classical singularity occurs at finite value of an evolution parameter .",
