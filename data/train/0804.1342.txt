    "spin - glass systems @xcite continue to challenge many researchers in the area of magnetism . > from the theoretical point of view , its simplest version defined in terms of ising spin variables , the so - called ising spin glass ( isg ) , represents one of the most fascinating problems in the physics of disordered magnets .",
    "the isg mean - field solution , based on the infinite - range - interaction model , as proposed by sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) @xcite , presents a quite nontrivial behavior .",
    "the correct low - temperature solution of the sk model is defined in terms of a continuous order - parameter function @xcite ( i.e. , an infinite number of order parameters ) associated with many low - energy states , a procedure which is usually denominated as replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) .",
    "furthermore , a transition in the presence of an external magnetic field , known as the almeida - thouless ( at ) line @xcite , is found in the solution of the sk model : such a line separates a low - temperature region , characterized by rsb , from a high - temperature one , where a simple one - parameter solution , denominated as replica - symmetric ( rs ) solution , is stable .",
    "the validity of the results of the sk model for the description of more realistic systems , characterized by short - range - interactions , represents a very polemic question @xcite .",
    "recent numerical simulations claim the absence of an at line in the three - dimensional short - range isg @xcite , as well as along the non - mean - field region of a one - dimensional isg characterized by long - range interactions @xcite . however , these results , obtained with rather small lattice - size simulations , do not rule out the possibility of a crossover to a different scenario at much larger lattice sizes , or also for smaller fields ( and/or temperatures ) .",
    "one candidate for alternative theory to the sk model is the droplet model @xcite , based on domain - wall renormalization - group arguments for spin glasses @xcite . according to the droplet model",
    ", the low - temperature phase of any short - range spin glass should be described in terms of a single thermodynamic state ( together , of course , with its corresponding time - reversed counterpart ) , i.e. , essentially a rs - type of solution .",
    "many important features of the isg still deserve an appropriate understanding within the droplet - model scenario , and in particular , the validity of this model becomes questionable for increasing dimensionalities , where one expects the existence of a finite upper critical dimension , above which the mean - field picture should prevail .",
    "some diluted antiferromagnets , like @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , have been the object of extensive experimental research , due to their intriguing properties @xcite .",
    "these systems are able to exhibit , within certain concentration ranges , random - field , spin - glass or both behaviors , and in particular , the compounds @xmath6 and @xmath7 are characterized by large crystal - field anisotropies , in such a way that they may be reasonably well - described in terms of ising variables .",
    "therefore , they are usually considered as good physical realizations of the random - field ising model ( rfim ) , or also of an isg . for the @xmath6 ,",
    "one gets a rfim - like behavior for @xmath9 , an isg for @xmath10 , whereas for intermediate concentrations ( @xmath11 ) one may observe both behaviors depending on the magnitude of the applied external magnetic field [ rfim ( isg ) for small ( large ) magnetic fields ] , with a crossover between them @xcite . in what concerns @xmath7 ,",
    "one gets an isg - like behavior for @xmath12 , whereas for @xmath13 one has a typical rfim with a first - order transition turning into a continuous one due to a change in the random fields @xcite .",
    "even though a lot of experimental data is available for these systems , they still deserve an appropriate understanding , with only a few theoretical models proposed for that purpose @xcite . within the numerical - simulation technique",
    ", one has tried to take into account the basic microscopic ingredients of such systems @xcite , whereas at the mean - field level , a joint study of both isg and rfim models has been shown to be a very promising approach @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the effects of random magnetic fields , following a continuous probability distribution , in an isg model .",
    "the model is considered in the limit of infinite - range interactions , and the probability distribution for the random magnetic fields is a double gaussian , which consists of a sum of two independent gaussian distributions .",
    "such a distribution interpolates between the bimodal and the simple gaussian distributions , which are known to present distinct low - temperature critical behavior , within the mean - field limit @xcite .",
    "it is argued that this distribution is more appropriate for a theoretical description of diluted antiferromagnets than the bimodal and gaussian distributions . in particular , for given ranges of parameters , this distribution presents two peaks , and satisfies the requirement of effective random fields varying in both sign and magnitude , which comes out naturally in the identification of the rfim with diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform field @xcite ; this condition is not fulfilled by simple discrete probability distributions , e.g. , the bimodal one , which is certainly very convenient from the theoretical point of view .",
    "recently , the use a double - gaussian distribution in the rfim @xcite yielded interesting results , leading to a candidate model to describe the change of a first - order transition into a continuous one that occurs in @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the use of this distribution in the study of the present model should be relevant for @xmath7 with concentrations @xmath14 , where the isg behavior shows up . in the next section we study the sk model in the presence of the above - mentioned random magnetic fields ; a rich critical behavior is presented , and in particular , one finds a critical frontier that may present one , or even two , tricritical points .",
    "the instabilities of the rs solution are also investigated , and at lines presenting an inflection point , in concordance with those measured in some diluted antiferromagnets , are obtained .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present our conclusions .",
    "the infinite - range - interaction ising spin - glass model , in the presence of an external random magnetic field , may be defined in terms of the hamiltonian    @xmath15    where the sum @xmath16 applies to all distinct pairs of spins @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "7 we compare typical results obtained for the ising spin - glass model in the presence of a double gaussian distribution characterized by @xmath138 with those already known for such particular cases . in these comparisons , we have chosen qualitatively similar phase diagrams , mainly taking into account the critical frontier that separates the regions with @xmath77 and @xmath121 . in fig .",
    "7(a ) we exhibit the phase diagram of the present model [ @xmath124 ] together with the one of an isg in the presence of random fields described by a single gaussian distribution ; both phase diagrams are qualitatively similar to the one of the standard sk model . in fig .",

    "typical situations for the cases of the bimodal and double gaussian distributions , where two tricritical points appear along the critical frontier that separates the regions with @xmath77 and @xmath121 , are shown in fig .",

    "next , we analyze the at instability for @xmath140 ; in this case , eq .  (",
    "[ 15 ] ) may be written as    @xmath141    which corresponds to the same instability found in the case of a single - gaussian random field @xcite . in fig .",
    "8 we exhibit at lines for two typical values of distribution widths ; in each case the at line separates a region of rs from the one characterized by rsb .",
    "one notices that the region associated with rsb gets reduced for increasing values of @xmath2 ; however , the most interesting aspect in these lines corresponds to an inflection point , which may be identified with the one that has been observed in the experimental equilibrium boundary of the compound @xmath6 @xcite . up to now , this effect was believed to be explained only through the isg in the presence of a single - gaussian random field , for which the phase diagrams in the cases @xmath142 are much simpler , with all phase transitions being continuous , typically like those of the sk model .",
    "herein , we have shown that an inflection point in the at line may also occur in the present model , for which one has a wide variety of phase diagrams in the corresponding case @xmath142 , as exhibited above .",
    "therefore , the present model would be appropriate for explaining a similar effect that may be also observed experimentally in diluted antiferromagnets characterized by first - order phase transitions , like @xmath7 .",
    "we have studied an ising spin - glass model , in the limit of infinite - range interactions and in the presence of random magnetic fields distributed according to a double - gaussian probability distribution .",
    "such a distribution contains , as particular limits , both the single - gaussian and bimodal probability distributions . by varying the parameters of this distribution ,",
    "a rich variety of phase diagrams is obtained , with continuous and first - order phase transitions , as well as tricritical points .",
    "the condition for the existence of a single finite - temperature tricritical point at the critical frontier paramagnetic - ferromagnetic ( i.e. , in the region of stability of the replica - symmetric solution ) , characterized by a first - order line at low temperatures , is derived analytically .",
    "besides that , we found an inflection point in the at line ( in the plane magnetic field versus temperature ) , which may correspond to the one observed in the compound @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this effect , which has already shown up in the ising spin - glass model in the presence of a gaussian random field @xcite , is herein obtained for a more general probability distribution for the magnetic fields .",
    "hence , the present model is appropriate for explaining a similar effect that could be observed also in diluted antiferromagnets characterized by first - order phase transitions , like @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , with this random - field distribution , one may adjust the model to given physical situations , in order to reproduce a wide diversity of effects that occur in real systems .",
    "the double - gaussian probability distribution , defined above , is suitable for a theoretical description of random - field systems , being a better candidate for such a purpose than the two most commonly used distributions in the literature , namely , the bimodal and single - gaussian distributions , due to the following reasons : ( i ) in the identifications of the rfim with diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform magnetic field , the local random fields are expressed in terms of quantities that vary in both sign and magnitude @xcite .",
    "this characteristic rules out the bimodal probability distribution from such a class of physical systems .",
    "the double - gaussian probability distribution is appropriate for a description of diluted antiferromagnets for a large range of magnetic concentrations , like in the rfim , as well as in the isg regimes .",
    "( ii ) although the rfim defined in terms of a single - gaussian probability distribution for the fields is physically acceptable , it usually leads to a continuous phase transition at finite temperatures , either within mean - field @xcite , or standard short - range - interaction approaches @xcite .",
    "such a system is not able to exhibit first - order phase transitions and tricritical points , that may occur in some diluted antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior was obtained for an isg in the presence of random magnetic fields following a single - gaussian probability distribution , where all phase transitions were found to be continuous @xcite . the present model , defined in terms of a double - gaussian probability distribution , is expected to be relevant for @xmath7 ( which is known to exhibit a first - order phase transition in the rfim regime @xcite ) with concentrations @xmath14 , where the isg behavior shows up ."
