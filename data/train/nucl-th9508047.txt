    "note that our choice of the coordinate system is different from that introduced in the born approximation calculations of @xcite in which @xmath74 denotes the polar angle of the intermediate photon .",
    "however , since the coulomb field disturbs the momentum balance we can not determine the momentum of the intermediate photon from the momenta of the outgoing leptons , which would be necessary to calculate the photon polar angle .    depending on the experimental setup and reactions various coordinate systems",
    "may be established in which the statistical tensors are determined .",
    "here we concentrate on the coulomb excitation of heavy ions in collisions with beam energies at or below the coulomb barrier . in this case",

    "the @xmath117 axis is then chosen such that the @xmath117 component of the projectile velocity is positive @xcite . in the sudden approximation",
    "it can be shown that the nuclear states are excited with a population of the magnetic substates reaching a maximum around @xmath118 , i.e. , the nucleus is aligned in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath1 axis ( asymptotic recoil direction of the target ) @xcite . this is called oblate alignment .",
    "taking into account the de - excitation of the nucleus by @xmath0 cascades starting from high - spin the oblate alignment changes into a prolate alignment with respect to the @xmath1 axis for the low - spin states .",
    "if the collision energy is increased the nuclear alignment changes to a polarization with respect to a reference axis perpendicular to the scattering plane @xcite .",
    "classically this corresponds to the situation where the drag caused by surface friction puts the nuclei into a spinning motion .",

    "one recognizes a strong dependence of the pair conversion probability on the polar angle of the positron with respect to the reference axis .",
    "this behaviour resembles the anisotropic emission of the intermediary photon @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution depends weakly on the dihedral angle @xmath41 of the electron - positron pair ( fig .  4 ) .",

    "angular correlations are very sensitive to the underlying process",
    ". they may reveal a plethora of signatures for nuclear transition which allow for an identification of the transition as well as for the study of the properties of excited nuclei . especially for large-@xmath119",
    "nuclei one can not rely on the validity of the born approximation which becomes exact in the limit @xmath121 .",
    "one rather has to perform the calculations with the relativistic scattering wave functions for both electron and positron .",
    "these wave functions take the coulomb distortion caused by the nuclear charge into account .    for magnetic transitions of large-@xmath119 nuclei one",
    "has also to account for the finite - size effects .",
    "especially m1 transitions are very sensitive on the extension of the nucleus . in order to study magnetic ipc we approximated the nucleus undergoing the transition by a homogeneously charged sphere .",
    "the angular correlation of electron - positron pairs with respect to a given axis in space depend on the statistical tensors which reflect the population of the nuclear magnetic substates .",
    "the conversion probability changes drastically when either the opening angle of the pair or the polar angle of the positron is varied while the dependence on the dihedral angle is rather weak .",
    "our calculations allow to make quantitative predictions of this behaviour which qualitatively might have been anticipated from the @xmath0-ray spectroscopy performed in heavy - ion collisions .",
