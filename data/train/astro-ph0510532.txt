    "scattering of ambient light by fast moving flows has been recognized as a conceivable mechanism operating in different classes of objects .",
    "this process quite likely contributes to the linear polarization of initially unpolarized soft radiation up - scattered in blazar jets @xcite , winds from accretion discs @xcite and in gamma - ray bursts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a significant level of intrinsic linear polarization of @xmath0% was reported in a microquasar gro j1655 - 40 @xcite and similarly for ls5039 @xcite in the optical band . a model of magnetized fireball polarization",
    "was discussed by @xcite , who demonstrate that the expected polarization lightcurve should exhibit two peaks .",
    "variations of the galactic centre linear polarization were reported in the millimetre band @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite brought the attention to strong - gravity effects in polarimetry of accreting millisecond pulsars .",
    "the idea of x - ray polarization studies providing clues to the physics of accreting compact objects was discussed in seminal papers ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . here",
    "we study a simple model with thomson scattering on electrons ejected outwards from the centre or falling back ; a novel point is that we consider strong gravity effects .",
    "the source of seed photons can be identified with the surface of a central star lying in arbitrary ( finite ) distance from the scatterer .",
    "alternatively , it can represent an axially symmetric accretion disc near a black hole , a quasi - isotropic ( ambient ) radiation field , or a combination of all these possibilities . in order to avoid numerical complexities",
    "we do not discuss other radiation mechanisms that also produce polarization , namely , we do not consider synchrotron self - compton process , which is the most likely process wherever magnetic fields interact with relativistic particles ( see @xcite ; @xcite for discussion and for further references ) .",
    "in the non - relativistic regime , a conceptually similar problem was examined by @xcite and @xcite , who considered polarization of light of a finite - size star due to scattering on free electrons in a fully ionized circumstellar shell .",
    "these works showed non - negligible solid angle of the source subtended on the local sky of scattering particles has a depolarizing influence on the observed fractional polarization .",
    "this result was discussed by various authors , because the scattering of stellar continuum is a probable source of net polarization of visible light in early - type stars , for which polarimetry has become a standard observational tool ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "general relativity effects are negligible in these objects , however , even the newtonian limit is complex enough : the observed signal does not easily allow to disentangle the contribution of a circumstellar shell , the primary radiation of the star and the effect of interstellar medium . in our case the situation complicates further , because the system is highly time - dependent and mutual time delays along different light rays must be taken into account .",
    "the general relativity signatures , which we discuss in this paper , reach maximum in a system containing a compact body with radius less than the photon circular orbit , i.e.  @xmath1 .",
    "this can arise either as a result of a non - stationary system with @xmath2 , presumably during a gravitational collapse , or it can represent a static ultra - compact star if such exist in nature . here",
    "we impose spherical symmetry of the gravitational field , and so both situations are identical as far as the form of spacetime metric is concerned .",
    "the schwarzschild vacuum solution describes the external gravitational field of all types of compact objects within general relativity , provided that their rotation is negligible and self - gravity of accreting matter does not contribute significantly to the gravitational field .",
    "we will assume that these constraints are fulfilled .",
    "a sequence of @xmath3 situations can be employed in order to model a collapsing case .",
    "the formalism that we apply works for a system with arbitrary compactness , even if the case of @xmath4 seems to be an unrealistically large compactness per se , likely violating the causality condition for neutron stars .",
    "such a high compactness would thus be normally excluded , however , the situation has not yet been definitively settled ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . according to astrophysically realistic equations of state",
    ", neutron - star sizes do not reach ultra - compact dimensions ; their typical radii should exceed the photon circular orbit ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and so the gravitational effects are constrained accordingly .",
    "however , the possibility of @xmath5 being slightly less than @xmath6 persists , and there seems to be a growing awareness now of the fact that the very high density regime needs to be explored further .",
    "the interest in ultra - compact stars has been recently revived mainly in connection with gravitational waves in general relativity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one may consider also more exotic options .",
    "strange quark stars ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) can have their radii extending down to the buchdal limit ( see @xcite for a recent review on other forms of quark matter and their relevance for compact stars ) . if nucleons can be confined at the density lower than nuclear matter density , then q - stars could exist with a relatively high mass of @xmath7 and the radius as small as @xmath8 ( e.g.  @xcite ) . on a more speculative level",
    "is the idea of gravastars @xcite , compactness of which can exceed the buchdal limit .",
    "options for detecting the thermal radiation from different kinds of ultra - compact stars have been recently discussed by @xcite . in the case of transiently accreting neutron stars ,",
    "the crustal heating has been nominated as one of relevant mechanisms generating thermal emission from the surface ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the issue of realistic equations of state for ultra - compact star matter is beyond the scope of the present paper , likewise the actual observational information on masses and radii of compact stars ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". it will be convenient to introduce a dimensionless parameter , @xmath9 , which maps the whole range of radii above the star surface onto @xmath10 interval , so that the form of graphs does not change with the star compactness .",
    "we consider the whole range of @xmath11 allowed by general relativity .",
    "it is worth noticing that the formalism used below could be readily applied also to the case of an accretion disc as a source of light near a black hole .",
    "obviously , a black hole represents a body with the maximum compactness and , at the same time , it is the most conservative option for such an ultra - compact object ( lower , axial symmetry of the disc radiation field limits the possibility of exploring the problem in an analytical way ) .",
    "our paper takes general relativity effects into account , including the effect of higher - order images if they arise .",
    "although the signal is usually weak in these images , favourable geometrical arrangements are possible and , even more importantly , photons of the higher - order image experience a characteristic delay with respect to photons following a direct course .",
    "this delay ( examined in detail by @xcite ; @xcite ) could help revealing the presence of strong gravitational field in the system .",
    "our model provides a useful test bed for astrophysically more realistic schemes . in the next section",
    "we formulate the model and describe calculations .",
    "then we show comparisons with previous results of other authors .",
    "we build our discussion on the approach of beloborodov ( @xcite , for polarization ) and abramowicz et al.(@xcite , for the motion in combined gravitational and radiation fields in general relativity ) . in these papers",
    "the individual components of the whole picture were treated separately , while we connect them together in a consistent scheme .",
    "a reader interested only in the main results on polarization of higher - order images from light scattered on a moving cloudlet can proceed directly to section  [ sec : cloudlet ] .    as a final point of the introduction",
    ", it is worth noticing that @xcite propose a model of aborted jets in which colliding clouds and shells occur very near a black hole and are embedded in strong radiation field . according to their scheme , most of energy dissipation should take place on the symmetry axis of an accretion disc .",
    "this would be another suitable geometry , in which a fraction of light is boosted in the direction to the photon circular orbit and eventually redirected to the observer .",
    "one may fear that the thomson scattering approximation is not adequate to describe a turbulent medium in which electrons become very hot @xcite , however , the accuracy should be still sufficient for energies of several kev , at which planned polarimeters are supposed to operate . also the seed photons have different distribution when they originate from an accretion disc , but we examined the variation of the polarization that an observer can expect from this kind of a system @xcite , and our calculations confirm that the expected polarization has magnitude smaller but roughly similar to values predicted by a simple model adopted here .",
    "we assume fully ionized optically thin medium distributed outside the source of seed photons . these primary photons follow null geodesics until they are intercepted by an electron , which itself is moving under the mutual competition between gravity and radiation",
    "( we do not consider the effect of magnetic fields on the particle motion and radiation in this paper ) .",
    "hence , we adopt the approximation of single scattering and we assume schwarzschild metric for the gravitational field of a compact body .",
    "we consider frequency - integrated quantities .",
    "polarization vector of scattered light is propagated parallelly through gravitational field to a distant observer and , as consequence , the polarization magnitude @xmath12 and the redshifted intensity @xmath13 ( expressed here in terms of the redshift @xmath14 ) are invariant .",
    "polarization is described in terms of stokes parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite : @xmath15 has a meaning of intensity along a light ray , @xmath16 and @xmath17 characterize the linear polarization in two orthogonal directions ( say @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) in the plane perpendicular to the ray , and @xmath18 is the circularity parameter .",
    "the polarization angle is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "it gives the orientation of major axis of the polarization ellipse with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "one can form a polarization basis in the local space by supplementing @xmath19 and @xmath20 with another unit vector , @xmath22 , pointed in the direction of the light ray .",
    "three parameters are necessary to describe a monochromatic beam , for which the condition @xmath23 holds . in case of partially polarized light",
    "the whole set of four parameters is generally required .",
    "it is then customary to define the degree of elliptical polarization , @xmath24 , which satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "a four - dimensional tetrad can be constructed by extending the three base vectors and supplementing them with a purely timelike four - vector .",
    "a suitable choice of the tetrad is described below .",
    "let us consider a simple case when the incident radiation field is axially symmetric in the laboratory frame , lf , with the basis @xmath26 .",
    "indices of four - vectors with respect to a local - frame basis are manipulated by the flat - space metric , @xmath27 .",
    "we orient @xmath28 along the symmetry axis ; other two spatial vectors , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , lie in a plane perpendicular to @xmath28 .",
    "further , we assume that scattering electrons are streaming along the symmetry axis with four - velocity @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is lorentz factor , @xmath35 is velocity in lf divided by speed of light ) . later on we carry out a lorentz boost to the co - moving frame ( cf ) of the scatterer , @xmath36 , which is equipped with timelike four - vector @xmath37 and three space - like four - vectors @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "spatial part of @xmath40 is oriented in the direction of relative velocity of both frames .",
    "each incident photon of the ambient unpolarized radiation gets highly polarized when scattered by a relativistically moving electron .",
    "the total polarization is eventually obtained by integrating over incident directions and the distribution of scattering electrons . in order to describe propagation of scattered photons ,",
    "we denote four - vectors @xmath41 ( with respect to lf ) and @xmath42 ( with respect to cf ) , where @xmath43 is the photon four - momentum ( a null four - vector ) . due to the axial symmetry we can assume @xmath44 .",
    "in addition to the above - defined reference frames lf and cf , we introduce two ` polarization ' frames : the lab polarization frame ( lpf ) with basis @xmath45 , and the co - moving polarization frame ( cpf ) with the basis @xmath46 .",
    "lpf is defined in such a way that @xmath22 is the three - space projection of the propagation four - vector @xmath47 , @xmath19 lies in the @xmath48-plane , and @xmath20 is identical with the lf tetrad vector @xmath30 .",
    "cpf is defined analogically and indicated by bars over variables .",
    "our definition of the reference frames is apparent from figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we start by calculating the polarization of the scattered radiation in cpf .",
    "conceptually the model of local polarization is equivalent to the one employed by @xcite .",
    "the incident radiation is unpolarized with intensity @xmath49 .",
    "it can be imagined as a superposition of two parallel beams of identical intensities , @xmath50 , propagating along @xmath51 four - vector .",
    "the two beams are completely linearly polarized in mutually perpendicular directions and the scattered radiation is a mixture of both components . in the adopted choice of reference frames",
    "( see the figure  [ fig1 ] ) , the spatial projection of the propagation vector @xmath52 is identical with the spatial projection of @xmath53 .",
    "unequal contributions @xmath54 and @xmath55 to the total intensity @xmath56 result in net linear polarization of the scattered beam . according to this , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58",
    "are non - zero , whereas the circularity parameter @xmath59 vanishes .    assuming that each scattered photon experiences one scattering event in an optically thin medium ( @xmath60 ) , non - zero contributions to stokes parameters are @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the scattering angle between @xmath63 and @xmath47 , @xmath64 .",

    "we obtain @xmath71 this form is useful , as it allows integrating conveniently the partial contributions over incident directions to obtain @xmath72 for the total stokes parameters of scattered light .",
    "we denoted @xmath73 the stress - energy tensor of the incident radiation field .",

    "the scattered radiation is partially polarized either in the @xmath83-plane , or perpendicularly to it .",
    "the former and the latter case will be referred as longitudinal and transverse polarization , respectively . later on , in sec .",
    "[ sec : relstar ] , we will demonstrate that this change can occur also with a group of cold electrons , whose bulk motion is determined by the radiation and gravitational fields of a star and recorded in the lab frame .",

    "firstly , of particular interest is the velocity at which the polarization of scattered radiation vanishes @xcite .",
    "the condition for velocity follows from the requirement @xmath94 performing the lorentz boost to lf we obtain @xmath95 this is a quadratic equation for @xmath35 , which has two roots , @xmath96 where @xmath97 clearly , eq .  ( [ eq : pi00 ] ) can be satisfied independently of the direction of observation . for @xmath98",
    "the polarization changes from longitudinal to transversal .",
    "secondly , we introduce the saturation velocity @xmath99 @xcite . as was shown by various authors under different approximations about the particle cross - section and the form of gravitational field ( see e.g.@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the saturation velocity plays an important role in the dynamics of relativistic jets : particles moving at velocity smaller / greater than the saturation velocity gain / lose their momentum at the expense of the radiation field .",
    "in absence of other acceleration mechanisms and neglecting inertia of particles , the effect of radiation pressure eventually leads to @xmath100 as terminal speed of the particle motion .",

    "the critical velocities are @xmath111 in this case .    figure  [ fig : iso ] shows the dependence of @xmath112 on observing angle according to equation  ( [ eq : pi1 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that we explore the frequency - integrated model , because this assumption is adequate for the purpose of clarification of the role gravitational lensing ( discussed in the next section ) .",
    "the same dependency of stokes parameters on the scatterer velocity and observer viewing angle is obtained in frequency - dependent calculation with the spectral index of the incident radiation equal to @xmath113 ( the case adopted originally by @xcite ) .",
    "our results are consistent with @xcite provided that appropriate averaging over energy is adopted",

    "in particular , the curves are identical for @xmath114 and they approach the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath115 ( originally examined again by @xcite , and invoked more recently e.g.  by @xcite ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to the case of a head - on collision , when all photons are impinging at incident angles @xmath116 because of aberration in cf .    for moderate lorentz factors",
    "there is some difference between our profile of @xmath117 and the corresponding numerical values plotted in @xcite . for example , checking the @xmath118 curve , we notice that relative difference amounts to roughly @xmath119% .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is explained by realizing that our eq .",

    "one can modify the previous example by considering a constant ratio of energy density , i.e.  by replacing @xmath157 with another parameter , @xmath158 this definition captures better the case when the ambient light originates from scattering of the central component ( perhaps on clumps being accreted onto the star ) , so that both contributions are linked to each other and their energy density decreases at identical rate with the distance .",

    ". these can be classified into different categories ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) according to the behaviour of saturation curves in @xmath188-plane .",
    "notice that we already examined one of these solutions , i.e.  the saturation curve ( [ eq : beta0 ] ) for very high luminosity of the star and negligible mass of the particle , i.e. , @xmath189 .",
    "the motion is then governed solely by radiation drag .",
    "we select this condition because it is particularly relevant for the discussion of the resulting polarization of scattered light .",
    "its role can be inferred also from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the @xmath99-curve for this case passes through the critical point of contour lines of @xmath190 .",
    "the limit of @xmath189 is an extreme case .",
    "different profile @xmath155 applies to moderate values of the luminosity parameter , @xmath191 , when particles do not strictly maintain the saturation velocity because of inertial effects acting on them .",
    "different categories of the particle motion then provide a natural framework also for the discussion of the resulting polarization .",
    "three most important cases are recorded in figure  [ fig : trajectories ] . in this example",
    "only the stellar radiation is taken into account , whereas the component @xmath192 for simplicity .",
    "the cases shown here correspond to the situation when ( i )  the radiation field dominates over gravity and the electron is therefore pushed away to an infinite radius ( see the left panel ) ; ( ii )  a moderate value of the luminosity allows the scattering electrons to reach an equilibrium position at @xmath193 ( middle ) ; ( iii )  the luminosity is very small and the particles are almost free - falling in the gravitational field ( right ) .",
    "particles start from @xmath194 and they quickly adhere to the saturation curve @xmath195 , provided that radiation is dynamically important , i.e.  in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "this occurs independently of initial velocity ; then the motion follows a curve adjacent to but slightly different from the saturation curve . on the other hand , in the case ( iii )",
    "the gravitation governs the motion ; the trajectory @xmath196 is only slightly asymmetric with respect to @xmath181 line by the weak influence of radiation .    by coupling the equations of particle motion with the polarization equations of sec .",
    "[ sec : scattered ] we obtain stokes parameters of scattered light along each particle trajectory .",
    "bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] show the resulting magnitude of polarization . notice how it crosses zero level at certain distance of the scatterer from the stellar surface .",
    "at this point polarization changes direction from transverse to longitudinal .",
    "points of intersection of curves @xmath160 with the particle motion @xmath196 determine the radial location of the point of vanishing polarization ( indicated by dotted vertical lines in the plot ) .",
    "we will now assume that a small cloudlet is formed by a group of electrons .",
    "we can distinguish three cases , depending on the bulk velocity of the cloudlet .",
    "these are discussed in subsections [ sec : outward][sec : inward ] below .",
    "the predicted time dependence offers a way to test the model .",
    "let us denote @xmath197 radius of the cloud and @xmath198 its angular radius as seen from the center .",
    "we assume that the cloud has small optical depth , @xmath199 , and it is ejected along @xmath200-axis , with bulk velocity @xmath201 directed approximately toward an observer ( inclination angle of the observer is denoted @xmath202 ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath114 implies the scattered photons are boosted in the direction of motion .",
    "although light bending increases the apparent size of the star on the particle local sky , general relativity effects are quite negligible on scattered photons moving straight away from the center .",
    "only few photons are scattered backwards , and therefore the direct image greatly dominates the signal received by an observer .        the measured radiation flux @xmath203 has two components : the primary unpolarized flux @xmath204 and the flux of partially polarized radiation scattered in the cloud @xmath205 .",
    "their ratio can be given in terms of redshifted intensities @xmath206 and @xmath207 of the star and of the cloud , and by the ratio of solid angles occupied by the cloud and by the star on observer sky .",
    "this provides us with the estimation of the expected fractional polarization of the total signal .",
    "the ratio of fluxes is @xmath208 intensity arriving from the cloud @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the locally emitted intensity , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : isc ] ) .",
    "the scattered component is polarized with the magnitude @xmath211 , as derived in the previous section .",
    "the total flux and the total polarization are @xmath212    substituting equation ( [ eq : isc ] ) into ( [ eq : s ] ) one can verify that the flux ratio @xmath213 does not depend on the star intensity @xmath214 , and hence @xmath215 where @xmath216 depends on the size and density of the cloud , and @xmath217 includes the geometry of the radiation field and the beaming / aberration effects arising from the cloud motion .",
    "we consider situations when @xmath218 is small ; then the two contributions to the radiation intercepted by the observer become comparable only in case of strong beaming , which leads to @xmath219 for small observing angles .",
    "the moment of observation , i.e.  the arrival time of photons @xmath220 , is related to the moment of emission @xmath170 by @xmath221\\cos\\theta,\\ ] ] where we set @xmath222 for the initial time and @xmath223 for the moment when the signal arrives to the observer . notice that this estimate is sufficient for direct image photons discussed in this subsection , but it would not be appropriate for higher - order image photons in the next subsection ( in schwarzschild geometry one can express time of arrival in terms of elliptic integrals , proceeding in the same analytical manner as above in the calculation of the ray trajectory ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the temporal behaviour is shown in figure  [ fig : frac ] .",
    "we assume that the cloud has been pre - accelerated to large initial speed @xmath224 near the star surface .",
    "the graph captures the subsequent phase of gravitational and radiative deceleration .",
    "the scattered light contributes significantly to the total signal only for a short initial phase ( a peak occurs in the graph ) .",
    "the local maxima of the radiation flux ( at @xmath225 ) and of polarization ( at @xmath226 ) can be understood in terms of beaming : most of radiation from the cloud is emitted in a cone with the opening angle @xmath227 about the direction of motion . for small viewing angle ( @xmath228  deg ) the observer",
    "was initially located outside this cone but , as time goes , the electron decelerates , the cone opens up and the observer intercepts more radiation .",
    "the maximum observed polarization occurs with a certain delay @xmath229 ( proportional to @xmath124 ) after the peak of radiation flux .",
    "subsequent decay of the signal is connected with a diminished scattering power of the cloud and the overall dilution of the radiation field . the observed polarization and the flux",
    "are lagged with each other and sensitive to the angle of observation .",
    "this behaviour is clearly seen also in figure  [ fig : frac3 ] , where we assumed several different viewing angles",
    ".     reaches up to @xmath230% for suitable view angles .",
    "values of @xmath202 ( in degrees ) are given with the curves .",
    "other parameters are the same as in previous figure.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we selected large initial velocity in this example , otherwise the effects of aberration and the doppler boosting would be less prominent , time - scales longer , and the effect of fractional polarization crossing zero point would disappear .",
    "the time span of this plot can be scaled according to the light - crossing time in physical units , @xmath231},\\ ] ] i.e.  proportionally to the central mass .",
    "the polarization magnitude is correlated with the intensity ( this correlation was already noticed for the isotropic radiation in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : iso ] ) .",
    "an interplay between gravity and the ambient radiation stalls the bulk motion , @xmath232 .",
    "scattered photons are then no longer boosted in the outward direction , and so the higher order ( highly bent ) rays can provide a non - negligible contribution to the observed light after encircling the star .",
    "this of course requires large compactness ; we set @xmath233 hereafter .",
    "again we assume an observer near @xmath200-axis and a cloudlet with a small size , @xmath234 .",
    "unlike a more traditional application of the lense geometry , the cloudlet is placed at an arbitrary finite distance @xmath235 above the star and the deflection angle does not have to be small .",
    "let us consider rays making a single round ( by the angle @xmath236 ) , with a radial turning point at pericenter @xmath237 tightly above the photon circular orbit . as mentioned in subsect .",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] , the equilibrium radius depends on the star luminosity .",
    "once the cloudlet settles at the equilibrium point @xmath238 , scattered photons are no more boosted to high energy and the collimation effect disappears .",
    "in this situation relatively more light is backscattered in the direction toward the photon orbit .",
    "part of these photons form a retrolensed image @xcite , which may also reach the observer .",
    "we thus now calculate ( de)magnification of light also for the two first - order images , which give the most significant contribution and may influence the net polarization at infinity . to this aim",
    "we need to consider rays starting near above the star , passing through pericenter and eventually escaping to infinity ( the retrolensing geometry ; see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and references cited therein ) .",
    "two arcs are formed which merge together in the einstein ring ( with radius just above @xmath239 ) if the observer is aligned with the source . by integrating null geodesics , expanding the elliptic integrals near the pericenter @xmath240 , assuming the deflection angle close to @xmath241 , and keeping only the leading terms we obtain the desired width of the two retrolensing images , @xmath242 where @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 , and @xmath246 we remark that @xmath241 was assumed for simplicity only .",
    "the case of arbitrary @xmath247 can be treated in similar way .",
    "time dependency of the arcs is caused by the scatterer motion , @xmath248 .",
    "we integrate over the cross - section of the arc images to derive their total luminosity and polarization at each time moment .",
    "higher - order images suffer from the de - magnifying influence of the light bending , which reduces their luminosity , unless a special geometrical alignment of the source and the observer occurs and favours the opposite effect of a caustic .",
    "this can be quantified by the gain factor , @xmath249 , which determines the ratio of fluxes received in retrolensed / direct images .",
    "the problem translates to evaluating the ratio of solid angles , @xmath250 , where indices `` i / o '' refer to the angular size of the source with / without taking the light bending into account . in the case of a small ( but finite ) size cloudlet",
    ", we find @xmath251 where the term @xmath252 , \\label{eq : phim}\\ ] ] arises from the integration over the einstein arcs .",
    "for @xmath253 the gain function is @xmath254 formula ( [ eq : mu ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( 21 ) of @xcite for @xmath255 , @xmath256 .",
    "in our situation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) requires that the cloudlet is sufficiently small in size and its motion is directed somewhat sideways with respect to the observer view angle .",
    "figure [ fig : mu ] compares @xmath257 with the corresponding result of a numerical integration , showing that the approximation is sufficiently accurate for our purposes .",
    "adding the contributions from different parts of the source has a depolarizing effect on the final signal , which we illustrate in figure  [ fig : static ] .",
    "for the total magnitude of polarization of the retrolensing images we find @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the polarization magnitude of light scattered in the direction towards the photon circular orbit and @xmath260 functions @xmath261 and @xmath262 were defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phim ] ) .",
    "function @xmath263 determines the shape of retrolensing images in the observer plane ; see figure  [ fig : static2 ] ( we resolve a narrow trace of these arcs on observer sky by enlarging their separation @xmath264 from the critical radius @xmath265 ) .",
    "polarization vectors of all three images have the same orientation , but they experience different time delays and lensing along each trajectory .",
    "the contribution of the retrolensed images is now evident , and quite significant .",
    "notice that the angle @xmath266 is the apparent angular size of the photon orbit as seen on the local sky of the cloudlet .",
    "it enters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : piret ] ) because higher - order images are formed almost exclusively by light scattered on the photon circular orbit . in our case , @xmath267 .",
    "the polarization magnitude drops sharply if the observer inclination is less than the angular size of the cloudlet .",
    "now we consider an intermediate situation with moderate velocity of the bulk motion ( both an outflow or an inflow , i.e.  @xmath268 ) . for a moderate outflow velocity",
    ", the result is shown in figure  [ fig : ael1 ] .",
    "we consider a particle on the decelerating branch of the trajectory in a weak radiation field , @xmath269 , which eventually reaches the turning point ( and starts falling afterwards ) .",
    "the two retrolensed images contribute about @xmath270% of the scattered flux at maximum and the trajectory crosses @xmath271 curve , where the polarization vector swings its direction .",
    "the outcome is quite different for matter infalling onto the star , because scattered photons are boosted in the downward direction and a considerable amount of light is then directed on the photon orbit . as a result ,",
    "the retrolensed images are more pronounced and they cause a brief flash of light .",
    "the resulting signal is shown in figure  [ fig : ael2 ] .",
    "the effect of retrolensed images is clearly visible in the polarization curve ; see figure  [ fig : ael3 ] .",
    "the case shown in the left panel exhibits a brief drop of the polarization magnitude when velocity crosses @xmath272 ( the direct image arrives at @xmath273 in dimensionless units ) . at this moment",
    "the polarization changes its orientation between transversal and the longitudinal one .",
    "then the signal restores back to a non - zero value and the same behaviour repeats when the retrolensed image arrives after a certain delay ( at @xmath274 ) .",
    "the case shown in the right panel exhibits a similar flash , also caused by the contribution of the retrolensed photons .",
    "however , now we observe a single fluctuation , which is actually an increase of the polarization magnitude ; this is because the case shown here corresponds to transversal polarization during the whole observation and the trajectory does not cross any of the critical curves @xmath275 .",
    "our calculation here is self - consistent in the sense that the motion of the blob and of photons , and the resulting polarization are mutually connected .",
    "we concentrated ourselves on gravitational effects and neglected other intervening processes , first of all the effect of magnetic fields to which polarization is sensitive ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "this allowed us to compare polarization magnitudes of direct and retrolensed images , which could point to the presence of a highly compact body .",
    "we have noticed the mutual delay between the signal formed by photons of different order .",
    "the delay is characteristic to the effect and has a value proportional to the central mass .",
    "polarimetric properties are susceptible to large changes depending on detailed physics and geometry of the source , and this is not only the advantage , which could help us to trace how different objects are functioning , but also a complication . in particular , the polarization is sensitive to the source orientation and its magnitude fluctuates from case to case .",
    "our results are useful for testing more complex and astrophysically realistic models with up - scattering of soft photons in jets and fast flows around black holes . in the black hole case",
    "the primary photons would be provided by an accretion disc rather than the star surface and , hence , one can no more take advantage of its spherical symmetry , which helped us to simplify our calculations here .",
    "nonetheless , the same formalism can be employed and similar features of time - dependent polarization lightcurves are expected ; strong gravity plays a vital role again . putting this in another way : provided a ` realistic ' equation of state implies neutron star radii greater than the photon circular orbit , detection of the signatures of retrolensing images , which we discussed above , would exclude a neutron star as a candidate on the central body .",
    "the authors thank john miller for his advice on the current status of neutron star modelling , and an anonymous referee for critical comments on the first version of the paper .",
    "vk appreciates fruitful discussions with participants of the aspen center for physics 2005 workshop revealing black holes .",
