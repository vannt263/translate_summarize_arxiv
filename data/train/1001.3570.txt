    "the information - based framework developed by brody _",
    "et al_.  ( 2007 , 2008a ) is a method to price assets based on incomplete information available to market participants about the cash flows of traded assets . in this approach the value of a number of different types of assets",
    "can be derived by modelling the random cash flows defining the asset , and by explicitly constructing the market filtration that is generated by the incomplete information about independent market factors that build the cash flows .",
    "this principle has been used in brody _",

    "et al_.  ( 2009 ) to price assets in a market with asymmetric information .",
    "however , for simplicity , in this framework it is typically assumed that interest rates are deterministic .",
    "one of the earliest generalizations of the models developed in brody _",
    "et al_.  ( 2007 ) to include stochastic interest rates can be found in rutkowski & yu ( 2007 ) . here",

    "pricing kernel models for interest rates have been studied in flesaker & hughston ( 1996 ) , hunt & kennedy ( 2004 ) and rogers ( 1997 ) , among others . in such models , the price @xmath3 at time @xmath4 of a sovereign bond with maturity @xmath5 and unit payoff ,",

    "term structure models with positive interest rates are generated by requiring that @xmath11 is a positive supermartingale . a more recent approach to constructing interest rate models in an information - based setting , presented in hughston & macrina ( 2009 ) ,",
    "develops the notion of an information - sensitive pricing kernel .",
    "the pricing kernel is modelled by a function of time and information processes that are observed by market participants and that over time reveal genuine information about economic factors at a certain rate . in order to obtain positive interest rate models ,",
    "this function must be chosen so that the pricing kernel has the supermartingale property .",

    "the brownian bridge information process considered in hughston & macrina ( 2009 ) and , more generally , the subclass of the continuous lvy random bridges , recently introduced in hoyle _ et al_.  ( 2009 ) , are examples of time - inhomogeneous markov processes .    in this paper",
    "we describe how credit - risky securities can be priced within the framework considered in brody",

    "we recall the result in akahori & macrina ( 2010 ) that can be used to obtain the explicit dynamics of the pricing kernel by use of so - called `` weighted heat kernels '' with time - inhomogeneous markov processes . in section 4",
    ", we derive the price process of a defaultable discount bond and compute the yield spreads between digital bonds and sovereign bonds .",
    "section 5 considers a number of random recovery models for defaultable bonds , and in the following section we derive a semi - analytical formula for the price of a european option on a credit - risky bond . in section 7",
    "we demonstrate how to price credit - inflation securities as an example of a hybrid structure .",
    "we investigate the valuation of credit - risky coupon bonds in section 8 and conclude by considering a pricing kernel that reacts to the level of debt accumulated in a country over a finite period of time .",

    "the defaultable bond pays a principal of @xmath100 units of currency , if there is no default , and @xmath101 units of currency in the event of default ; we call such an instrument a `` binary bond '' . in particular , if @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we call such a bond a `` digital bond ''",
    ". the price of the digital bond is @xmath104    we can generalize the above situation slightly by considering a pricing kernel @xmath11 of the form @xmath105 by following the technique in equations ( [ markovprop ] ) to ( [ credit risky bond ] ) , and by using the fact that at time @xmath5 we have @xmath106 , we can show that @xmath107 here we model the situation in which the pricing kernel in the economy is not only a function of information at that time about the macroeconomic variable , but is also dependent on noisy information about potential default of the firm leaked in the market through @xmath73 .",
    "this is relevant in light of events occurring in financial markets where defaults by big companies can affect interest rates and the market price of risk .",
    "a measure for the excess return provided by a defaultable bond over the return on a sovereign bond with the same maturity , is the bond yield spread .",
    "this measure is given by the difference between the yields - to - maturity on the defaultable bond and the sovereign bond , see for example bielecki & rutkowski ( 2002 ) .",
    "that is : @xmath108 for @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the yields associated with the sovereign bond and the credit - risky bond , respectively .",
    "we have : @xmath112 in particular , the bond yield spread between a digital bond and the sovereign bond is given by @xmath113 for bonds with payoff @xmath97 , we see that the information related to the macroeconomic factor @xmath15 does not influence the spread .",
    "thus for @xmath114 , the spread at time @xmath4 depends only on the information concerning potential default . in this case",
    ", the bond yield spread between the defaultable discount bond and the sovereign bond with stochastic interest rates is of the form of that in the deterministic interest rate setting treated in brody _",
    "et al_.  ( 2007 ) .    figure 1 shows the bond yield spreads between a digital bond , with all trajectories conditional on the outcome that the bond does not default , and a sovereign bond .",
    "the maturities of the bonds are taken to be @xmath115 years and the a priori probability of default is assumed to be @xmath116 .",
    "the effect of different values of the information flow parameter is shown by considering @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "since the paths of the digital bond are conditional on the outcome that default does not occur , we observe that the bond yield spreads must eventually drop to zero .",
    "the parameter @xmath119 controls the magnitude of genuine information about potential default that is available to bondholders . for low values of @xmath119 ,",
    "the bondholder is , so to speak,in the dark \" about the outcome until very close to maturity ; while for higher values of @xmath119 , the bondholder is better informed .",
    "as @xmath119 increases , the noisiness in the bond yield spreads , which is indicative of the bondholder s uncertainty of the outcome , becomes less pronounced near maturity .",
    "furthermore , if the bondholders in the market were well - informed , they would require a smaller premium for buying the credit - risky bond since its behaviour would be similar to that of the sovereign bond ; this is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the information - based asset pricing approach , an increased level of genuine information available to investors about their exposure , is manifestly equivalent to a sort of `` securitisation '' of the risky investments .",
    "the case for which the paths of the digital bond are conditional on default can also be simulated . here",
    ", the effect of increasing the information flow rate parameter @xmath119 is similar .",
    "however , the bondholder now requires an infinitely high reward for buying a bond that will be worthless at maturity .",
    "thus the bond - yield spread grows to infinity at maturity .",
    "the a priori probability of default is taken to be @xmath116 .",
    "we use ( i ) @xmath120 , ( ii ) @xmath121 , ( iii ) @xmath122 , and ( iv ) @xmath123 . ]",
    "let us consider the case in which the credit - risky bond pays @xmath124 where @xmath64 is a discrete random variable which takes values @xmath125 $ ] with a priori probabilities @xmath126 , where @xmath127 .",
    "such a payoff spectrum is a model for random recovery where at bond maturity one out of a discrete number of recovery levels may be realised .",
    "we can also consider credit - risky bonds with continuous random recovery in the event of default .",
    "in doing so , we introduce the notion of `` market - dependent recovery '' .",
    "suppose that the payoff of the defaultable bond is given by @xmath128 where @xmath64 takes the values @xmath129 with a priori probabilities @xmath130 .",
    "the recovery level @xmath131 is dependent on the information at time @xmath5 about the macroeconomic factor @xmath15 . in this case , if the credit - risky bond defaults at maturity @xmath5 , the recovery level of the bond depends on the state of the economy at time @xmath13 that is perceived in the market at time @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , if the sentiment in the market at time @xmath5 is that the economy will have good times ahead , then a firm in a state of default at @xmath5 may have better chances to raise more capital from liquidation ( or restructuring ) , thus increasing the level of recovery of the issued bond .",
    "we can price the cash flow ( [ h ] ) by applying equation ( [ credit risky bond ] ) , with @xmath132 and @xmath103 .",
    "the result is : @xmath133 where @xmath3 is given by equation ( [ hm ] ) . as an example",
    ", suppose that we choose the recovery function to be of the form @xmath134 in this case , it is possible to have zero recovery when the value of the information process at time @xmath4 is @xmath135 , thereby capturing the worst - case scenario in which bondholders lose their entire investment in the event of default .",
    "the latter consideration is apt in the situation where the extent of recovery is determined by how difficult it is for the firm to raise capital by liquidating its assets , i.e. the exposure of the firm to the general economic environment .",
    "however , this model does not say much about how the quality of the management of the firm may influence recovery in the event of default .",
    "this observation brings us to another model of recovery .",
    "default of a firm may be triggered by poor internal practices and ( or ) tough economic conditions .",
    "we now structure recovery by specifying the payoff of the credit risky bond by @xmath136 + ( 1-x_c)\\left[x_er_c + ( 1-x_e)r_{ce}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are random variables taking values in @xmath129 with a priori probabilities @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "we define @xmath137 and @xmath138 to be indicators of good management of the company and a strong economy , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath141 to be a continuous random variable assuming values in the interval @xmath142 .",
    "we take @xmath143 to be a function of @xmath144 , and @xmath145 to be a function of @xmath144 and @xmath141 , where both @xmath146 and @xmath145 assume values in the interval @xmath142 .",
    "the payoff in equation ( [ recovery ] ) covers the following situations : first , we suppose that despite good overall management of the firm , default is triggered as a result of a depressed economy . here , @xmath147 and @xmath148 which implies that @xmath149 .",
    "therefore the recovery is dependent on the state of the economy at time @xmath5 and thus , how difficult it has been for the firm to raise funds .",
    "it is also possible that a firm can default in otherwise favourable economic conditions , perhaps due to the management s negligence . in this case",
    "we have @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "thus @xmath152 and the amount recovered is dependent on the level of mismanagement of the firm .",
    "finally we have the worst case in which a firm is poorly managed , @xmath151 , and difficult economic times prevail , @xmath148 .",
    "recovery is given by the amount @xmath153 , which is dependent on both , the extent of mismanagement of the firm and how much capital the firm can raise in the face of an economic downturn . the particular payoff structure ( [ recovery ] ) is used in macrina ( 2006 ) to model the dependence structure between two credit - risky discount bonds that share market factors in common .",
    "further investigation may include the situation where one models such dependence structures for bonds subject to stochastic interest rates and featuring recovery functions of the form ( [ recovery ] ) .",
