    "light beam with subwavelength confinement and propagation beyond diffraction limit is highly desirable for many optical integration applications . to enable the subwavelength optical confinement ,",
    "optical materials supporting ultra - high wave vectors are necessary .",
    "since the refractive indices of natural materials are quite limited at optical frequency , metamaterials with artificially engineered subwavelength meta - atoms are designed to exhibit ultra - high refractive indices so as to achieve large wave vectors @xcite . to obtain diffraction - free deep subwavelength beam propagation , a nearly flat ifc curve over a broad range in @xmath0-space is required , so that all spatial components will propagate with the same phase velocity along the longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "extremely anisotropic metamaterials with infinite real part of permittivity have been theoretically proposed to achieve flat ifc and consequently the subwavelength beam propagation without diffraction @xcite .",
    "recently , metal - dielectric multilayer metamaterials with indefinite permittivity tensor have been utilized to demonstrate intriguing applications of negative refraction @xcite , subwavelength imaging @xcite , enhanced photonic density of states @xcite , and broadband light absorbers @xcite , together with ultra - high refractive indices for subwavelength optical waveguides @xcite and indefinite cavities @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we propose the concept of extreme loss - anisotropy in metal - dielectric multilayer metamaterials , where the longitudinal component of the permittivity tensor has ultra - large imaginary part .",
    "diffraction - free deep subwavelength beam propagation and manipulation is demonstrated in such loss - anisotropic metamaterial , due to the nearly flat ifc .",
    "the inset of fig .   shows the metal - dielectric multilayer structure , where titanium oxide ( @xmath1 ) with dielectric constant of @xmath2 and silver ( ag ) are chosen @xcite . when the thickness of each layer is infinitely small , the multilayer structure can be regarded as an anisotropic effective medium with permittivity tensor of @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the permittivity of titanium oxide and silver , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are the filling ratios of titanium oxide and silver , respectively .",
    "the silver filling ratio @xmath7 is 0.45 , and its permittivity is from the experimental results @xcite .",
    "the dependence of permittivity tensor on wavelength @xmath9 is shown in fig .  , which is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : emt ] ) according to the effective medium theory .",
    "it is found that the longitudinal permittivity component @xmath10 shows a strong resonance at @xmath11 ( at position slowromancap2@ ) , where @xmath12 has a peak more than 230 , while @xmath13 flips its sign quickly across the resonance from negative maximum ( at position slowromancap1@ ) to positive maximum ( at position slowromancap3@ ) .",
    "previously , ultra - large @xmath13 ( at position slowromancap3@ ) has been utilized to realize subwavelength beam propagation without diffraction @xcite .",
    "however , the behavior of ultra - high @xmath12 has not been considered before .",
    "it is intuitively thought that a large @xmath12 will increase the beam propagation loss . on the contrary",
    ", it will be demonstrated that the extreme loss - anisotropy with ultra - large imaginary part can enable low - loss diffraction - free subwavelength beam propagation . for tm - polarized light with non - vanishing @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 field components ,",
    "the corresponding ifc is determined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the transverse @xmath0-vector and @xmath19 is the propagation @xmath0-vector .",
    "figure   shows that an ultra - flat ifc over a large @xmath18 range is supported at the resonance wavelength @xmath11 ( position slowromancap2@ ) , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the propagation @xmath0-vector @xmath22 remains a constant for all different @xmath18 . while the imaginary part of the propagation @xmath0-vector @xmath23 is quite small . to understand the behavior of the flat ifc , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ifc ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath24 where the approximation @xmath25 has been used to derive the above formula . since @xmath26 is dominated by its real part , and @xmath10",
    "is dominated by its imaginary part at the resonance wavelength , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which shows that @xmath22 is independent of @xmath18 and @xmath23 is weakly proportional to @xmath29 . moreover ,",
    "the propagation loss @xmath23 is inversely proportional to @xmath12 and the large material loss @xmath12 actually enables the low - loss beam propagation .",
    "the ultra - large @xmath12 in extremely loss - anisotropic metamaterial not only gives rise to an ultra - flat ifc over a broad @xmath18 range , but also results in ultra - small beam propagation loss .",
    "to further illustrate the importance of large @xmath12 , the comparisons of ifc curves at three different wavelengths of slowromancap1@ , slowromancap2@ and slowromancap3@ are shown in fig .  , which corresponds to negatively maximized @xmath13 , maximized @xmath12 and maximized @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "it indicates that the maximized @xmath12 case results in the flattest ifc with almost zero curvature , while the other two ifcs show positive and negative curvatures , respectively .",
    "these behaviors can be clearly understood using eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx - ifc ] ) , in which a purely real @xmath10 will contribute to @xmath22 and influence the curvature of the ifc ( a positive @xmath30 leads to a negative curvature and vice versa ) .",
    "it is clear that the maximized @xmath12 case with zero curvature will achieve diffraction - free subwavelength beam propagation .",
    "next , diffraction - free deep - subwavelength beam propagation will be demonstrated from the numerical simulation based on finite element method ( fem ) .",
    "here it is worthwhile to define the minimal waist size of light beam which can propagate inside the multilayer structure without diffraction .",
    "it is known from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ifc ] ) that @xmath31 is required to obtain a nearly flat ifc , then the minimal beam waist size @xmath32 turns out to be @xmath33 .",
    "figure   shows the propagation of ultra - narrow gaussian beams ( with a waist size of @xmath34 ) inside the loss - anisotropic metamaterials with different geometries at the resonance wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "the effective medium results and the realistic multilayer results are shown in fig .   and fig .",
    ", respectively .",
    "figures   and show that ultra - narrow gaussian beams can propagate over a long distance without any wave - front distortion . two subwavelength beams with @xmath35 center - to - center distance",
    "remain well - defined as the beams propagating across the multilayer from the bottom to the top .",
    "it is emphasized that the subwavelength beam confinement is entirely due to the unique loss - anisotropic property , and the beam path is solely determined by the launching location .",
    "this is distinguished from the situation in a subwavelength waveguide , where the mode is confined by the waveguide boundary .",
    "besides the straight beam propagation , the flow of light can be flexibly modeled through controlling the local metamaterial properties .",
    "for instance , the beam path can be manipulated by gradually varying the direction of multilayers , since the direction of beam propagation is always vertical to the multilayer interface .",
    "the designed geometries for achieving @xmath36 and @xmath37 bending of subwavelength beams are shown in figs .   and , for both the effective media and the multilayer structure .",
    "in the effective medium calculation , the anisotropic permittivity tensor depends on the tilted angle of the multilayer interface . in the local coordinate @xmath38",
    ", the components of the permittivity tensor can still be determined by the mixing formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emt ] ) .",
    "the permittivity tensor expression in the global coordinate @xmath39 is related to that in the local coordinate as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the local tilted angle of multilayer with respect to the @xmath42 axis , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the local permittivity tensor components along and normal to the multilayer , respectively .",
    "the simulation results indicate that the flow of light can indeed be manipulated while maintaining the deep - subwavelength beam confinement and diffraction - free propagation . for the results of @xmath37 bending shown in figs .   and",
    ", it is noted that the wave - front becomes tilted at the output section ( but the energy flow is still vertical to the interface as a result of the flat ifc ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the light traveling at the inner side undergoes less optical path than the light traveling at the outer side .",
    "the phase difference arising from the light path difference leads to the beam wave - front tilting .",
    "figure   shows that the multilayer structure simulation results agree very well with the emt results , indicating that the multilayer structure with period @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) can represent the loss - anisotropic effective medium well .",
    "however , the fabrication of such thin layers is very challenging in reality ( but possible @xcite ) .",
    "it will be interesting to study the property of metal - dielectric multilayer with a large period @xmath47 , where the nonlocal effect has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the dispersion relation describing the realistic multilayer structure for tm - polarized light is @xmath48 = \\cos(k_{m}a_{m})\\cos(k_{d}a_{d } )          -\\gamma_{\\scriptscriptstyle\\mathrm{tm}}\\sin(k_{m}a_{m})\\sin(k_{d}a_{d}),\\ ] ] which is derived by treating the layered structure as a one - dimensional photonic crystal .",
    "here @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the ifcs corresponding to the realistic multilayer structure with @xmath52 are shown in fig .  .",
    "it is found that the ifc curve at @xmath11 is no longer flat due to the nonlocal effect .",
    "that is to say , the effective permittivity tensor becomes strongly wave vector dependent , so that the permittivity components @xmath26 and @xmath10 will be functions of not only the frequency but also the @xmath0-vector .",
    "the frequency corresponding to the flattest ifc will then be shifted . for the multilayer structure with @xmath52 , it turns out that the flattest ifc occurs at @xmath53 ( which can be mathematically determined by finding the working wavelength with zero ifc curvature ) , as shown in fig .  .",
    "the propagation of subwavelength gaussian beams at the two wavelengths in the multilayer structure with @xmath52 are shown in fig .  .",
    "as can be expected from the ifc curves in fig .  , the gaussian beams at @xmath11 suffer strong diffraction , resulting in distorted beam profiles . in comparison ,",
    "the beam profiles remain well - defined for the gaussian beams at @xmath53 .",
    "in conclusion , extremely loss - anisotropic metamaterial is designed using metal - dielectric multilayer structures .",
    "the ifc corresponding to such metamaterial turns out to be ultra - flat over a broad @xmath0-vector range .",
    "this unique property is then utilized to obtain diffraction - free deep subwavelength beam propagation .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the propagation of light beams can be manipulated flexibly by tuning the direction of multilayer structure . moreover ,",
    "the nonlocal effect occurring in multilayer structures with large multilayer period is investigated .",
    "it is found that diffraction - free beam propagation is still possible after taking into account the nonlocal effect .",
    "the current study is very attractive for many applications such as optical imaging , optical integration , on - chip optical communication .",
