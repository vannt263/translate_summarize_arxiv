    "before physics can be extracted from the numerical solution of the non  linear equations of motion that result from the actions we write , we must remove any systematic numerical effects that can occur in regimes where accuracy is compromised by cancellation among very large or very small numbers .",
    "typically , these manifest themselves at high bare quark mass in the condensate _ vs. _ mass curve , since in that regime we are near the ads boundary , where the conformal factor naturally grows rapidly .",
    "we know from the previous section that the condensate should fall to zero in this regime .",
    "the raw numerical results plotted in figure  [ fig : c_vs_m_k=001 ] show that this is masked by an offset .",
    "it is purely numerical and unphysical ( it is very similar to the deviation from zero seen for probe d7branes in pure ads in global coordinates  @xcite ) , and may be consistently subtracted from all subsequent computations .",
    "the deviation from zero occurs for all values of @xmath143 , and therefore , in order to isolate the purely numerical piece to use as a regulator , we choose to subtract off the curve for small @xmath143 ( here we use @xmath239 ) . after the appropriate rescaling given in equation  ( [ eqt : scaling ] ) , this curve can be used to extract the physical condensate at higher @xmath143 .",
    "we stress again that this subtraction is not physical in the sense that it is _ not _ akin to a contribution of an unknown counterterm .",
    "we have treated those fully in section  [ sec : counterterm ] .    .",
    "the deviation from zero for increasing mass is a numerical artifact , which we subtract in all later computations .",
    "recall that @xmath240.,width=240 ]    using this procedure , we calculate the physical condensate in figure [ fig : c_vs_m_unscaled ] .",
    "it is important to test that we have not damaged the physics , and to that end we rescale each curve according to equation ( [ eqt : scaling ] ) and find they exactly match as shown in figure [ fig : c_vs_m_scaled ] .",
    "we also present results for @xmath205 , where we see that the absence of the states below a minimum mass ( see section  [ sec : embeddings ] ) simply removes a piece from the condensate curve ( see figure [ fig : c_vs_m_gamma ] ) .    .",
    "recall that @xmath241.,width=268 ]",
    "an important quantity to compute is the constituent quark mass .",
    "this is given by the energy of a fundamental string stretching from the d7brane to the core of the geometry ( made of d3branes ) , starting at the place the d7brane ends .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the bare quark mass , which is the asymptotic separation of the d7brane from the d3branes , extracted in the uv .",
    "the two types of mass are readily visualized on figures  [ fig : zeromass ] and  [ fig : gammaembedding ] . far to the right",
    "the vertical distance from embedding to the horizontal axis gives the bare quark mass .",
    "far to the left , on the @xmath140 axis , the vertical distance from where the embedding ends to the singular locus gives the constituent quark mass .",
    "for the constituent quark mass , we calculate the energy of a string that hangs from the point where the @xmath82 has shrunk to zero size ( let us denote this point as @xmath242 ) to @xmath243 . in order to do this , we consider the nambu ",
    "goto action for the fundamental string ( in einstein frame ) given by : @xmath244 working in static gauge , we take as coordinates for the string worldsheet @xmath245 and @xmath246 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the string does not couple to the ns ",
    "ns 2form potential of the background .",
    "the physical energy ( the constituent quark mass ) is then given by the action ( per unit time ) multiplied by a factor of two to remove the factor of 1/2 from @xmath247 near the ads boundary ) : @xmath248 it is convenient to use @xmath11 as an integration variable to write ( with the help of equations  ( [ eq : firstorder ] ) and  ( [ eq : newz ] ) ) this equation as : @xmath249 we present the results for this in figure  [ fig : conmass ] , for the case @xmath250 .",
    "the key result here is that the constituent mass is always greater than the bare quark mass , and it is significantly greater as the d7brane approaches the singular locus .",
    "this result suggests that the embeddings experience a repulsive force from the background , as we observed earlier .    .",
    "recall that @xmath241.,width=268 ]",
    "we proceed to calculate part of the meson spectrum by calculating the quadratic fluctuations associated with the field @xmath174 @xcite : @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the solution we found in the previous section . substituting this form into the lagrangian and keeping only terms quadratic in @xmath253",
    ", we can calculate the equations of motion for the field @xmath254 . assuming a time dependence of the form : @xmath255 the asymptotic form @xmath256 means that @xmath257 is related to the mass of the meson via : @xmath258 following a similar scaling analysis to that done in section  [ sec : analytics ]",
    ", we find that @xmath257 scales linearly with  @xmath143 , and therefore the relevant quantity for us will be the ratio of the two .",
    "we plot our results for the spectrum ( extracted using fairly standard techniques presented for example in ref.@xcite ) in figure  [ fig : meson ] .",
    "as the figure indicates , the spectrum approaches that of pure ads as the bare quark mass increases .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the meson is consistently above that of pure ads , which is consistent with our previous result that the d7brane feels a repulsive force . finally , we find that the behavior of the curve near zero mass is well approximated by a function of the following form : @xmath259 where @xmath260 are constants .",
    "this is reminiscent of the form of the gmor relation  @xcite , although there is no spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking here .",
    "it is worth exploring further the origin of this behaviour , including how strongly it depends upon us having restricted to @xmath261 .",
    "we consider separately the calculation of the meson spectrum for our zero mass embedding .",
    "we only need to consider the fluctuations of the @xmath262 embedding to extract this .",
    "following the same procedure as before ( but now in terms of the coordinate @xmath74 ) , we find near the singular locus the solution for the fluctuation goes as : @xmath263 where @xmath264 .",
    "this behavior is exactly the ingoing / outgoing wave behavior we would expect for fluctuations near the event horizon of an extremal black hole @xcite .",
    "since we want our field to satisfy ingoing wave boundary conditions ( the plus sign ) , we can define a new field : @xmath265 near the ads boundary , @xmath266 behaves as : @xmath267 and we require that @xmath268 such that we only have a normalizable mode .",
    "we find that for a starting position of @xmath269 , the value of @xmath270 that satisfies the normalizibility condition is given by @xmath271 ( starting with @xmath272 .",
    "sending @xmath203 to zero gives us @xmath273 , which means we have a ( stable ) zero mass meson for zero bare quark mass .",
    "the results for our d7brane probe analysis fit nicely with what had already been established for this background using d3brane probes @xcite .",
    "the enhanon locus , the special place the d3branes become massless , is also the place where the d7branes that are massless quark flavours end .",
    "all other d7branes end above that locus , and in fact are somewhat bent away from it in their profile .",
    "it this way we have confirmed the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite that there is no chiral symmetry breaking in this background ( although they seem to have thought that this form of the embedding would depend on one of the angles of the @xmath82 , which we show is not necessary ) , since the zero mass embedding is not repelled by the enhanon ( hence no chiral condensate ) .",
    "the higher mass embeddings do have a condensate associated with them of course , and we have explored the dependence on mass , finding it to be smooth , regardless of the value of the adjoint mass . much the same can be said about the accompanying spectrum of mesons we explored .",
    "we have not addressed the meaning of our particular choices for the value of @xmath104 , which allowed us to find the solutions .",
    "@xmath104 is related to the phase angle of the mass matrix in the dual theory @xcite , and so it seems that this particular choice may have some physical meaning , but we have not yet explored that .    an important question to address is whether these choices are stable under fluctuations . unfortunately , due to the complicated nature of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we are not able to address this question by considering fluctuations of the field @xmath104 around our special values . however , it is important to note that the massless embedding is special here .",
    "the @xmath104dependence simplifies even further at @xmath212 , vanishing entirely .",
    "this suggests that the zero mass embedding persists for any value of @xmath104 , as might have been expected , and that there are additional symmetries in that case .",
    "possibly the embedding itself is supersymmetric , but in addition there is probably a continuous symmetry ( translations in @xmath104 ) that appears for that sector .",
    "this may also be connected to the gmor  like behaviour that we observed for the meson mass dependence as the bare quark mass approaches zero , although that meson is from the @xmath159 fluctuations , and we do not have a spontaneous symmetry breaking here .    there appears to be some qualitative similarities between features of our solution and that of solutions in global ads .",
    "it seems that our parameter @xmath144 , the adjoint mass , plays a similar role to the inverse radius of the @xmath82 on which the dual theory lives .",
    "a similar modification to the asymptotics in the field @xmath159 occurs , so we find a similar counterterm is needed .",
    "it would be nice to understand this further .",
    "the type of counterterms that can arise seem connected to the way in which the ( non - thermal ) parameter / deformation under discussion is introduced .",
    "sometimes it is at the level of the background itself ( such as in the global case , of the case here ) while in the case of a finite magnetic field @xcite or chemical potential @xcite where there is no logarithmic behavior , the parameter is introduced at the level at the level of the d7brane action itself .",
    "this is worth further exploration .",
    "this work was supported by the us department of energy and the usc college of letters , arts , and sciences .",
