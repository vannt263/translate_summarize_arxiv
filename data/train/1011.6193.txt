    "in the ensemble of macroscopically identical wires disorder fluctuates from wire to wire and so does the conductance .",
    "hence it is meaningful to evaluate for the ensemble of wires and to study the ensemble - averaged conductance @xmath57 , variance @xmath58 , resistance @xmath59 , etc .",
    "we now discuss a few important results of such studies .",
    "for simplicity we use the variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    , @xmath62 coming in the wire and the amplitudes @xmath63 , @xmath64 coming out the wire . ]",

    "for @xmath65 the formula gives the ballistic conductance @xmath66 .",
    "as @xmath7 increases , the formula first shows the classical transmission law @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the q1d localization length . if @xmath70 , the wire is in the diffusive regime . for @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "we obtain from the standard expression @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the diffusive conductivity , @xmath75 is the 2d fermi wave vector , and @xmath76 is the 2d electron density . however , the mesoscopic diffusive conductance is also affected by weak localization .",
    "hence , one in fact obtains from a slightly modified version of , namely @xcite @xmath77 where the term @xmath78 is the weak localization correction typical of the q1d wire .",
    "the mean free path @xmath10 in the above formulae coincides with the mean free path derived from the semiclassical boltzmann transport equation , i.e. , the quantum conductance captures the boltzmann transport limit exactly .",

    "the diffusive resistance and diffusive conductance thus coexist in a standard way : @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "if we include the weak localization by means of , then @xmath85 the conductance fluctuates in the diffusive regime as @xcite @xmath86 where the numerical factor @xmath87 is typical of the q1d wire .",

    "the formulae - hold for the wires with impurity disorder .",
    "do they hold also for the wires with rough edges ?",
    "in our present work we address this question from the first principles : we calculate the amplitudes @xmath56 by the scattering - matrix method @xcite for a large ensemble of macroscopically identical disordered wires , we evaluate the landauer conductance , and we perform ensemble averaging .",
    "in fact , a few serious differences between the wires with rough edges and wires with impurity disorder were identified prior to our work . in the wire with impurity disorder",
    "the channels are equivalent in the sense that @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the diffusive regime @xmath92 for all channels @xcite .",
    "in the impurity - free wires with rough edges @xmath93 decays fast with rasing @xmath46 , because the scattering by the rough edges is weakest in the channel @xmath94 and strongest in the channel @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "this is easy to understand classically : in the channel @xmath94 the electron avoids the edges by moving in parallel with them , while in the channel @xmath95 the motion is almost perpendicular to the edges , resulting in frequent collisions with them . as a result ,",
    "@xmath93 shows coexistence of the quasi - ballistic , diffusive , and strongly - localized channels @xcite . due to this coexistence , the work @xcite reported absence of the dependence @xmath96 , suggesting that the wire with rough edges does not exhibit the diffusive conductance .",
    "however , according to @xcite , the wire with rough edges seems to exhibit the diffusive resistance . in our present work",
    "these findings are examined again , but for significantly larger @xmath0 as in previous works .",
    "first we study the impurity - free wire whose edges have a roughness correlation length comparable with the fermi wave length . for @xmath97 we observe the quasi - ballistic dependence @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the quasi - ballistic resistivity .",
    "as @xmath7 increases , we observe crossover to the diffusive dependence @xmath100 , where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the effective contact resistance due to the @xmath103 open channels .",
    "we find the universal results @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath68 .",
    "as @xmath7 exceeds the localization length @xmath88 , the resistance shows onset of localization while the conductance shows the diffusive dependence @xmath106 up to @xmath107 and the localization for @xmath108 only .",
    "finally , we find @xmath109 the fluctuations differ from and were already reported in the past @xcite . for the smooth wires with impurities",
    "our calculations confirm the formulae - .",
    "moreover , we derive the wire conductivity from the semiclassical boltzmann equation @xcite , and we compare the semiclassical mean - free path with the mean - free path obtained from the quantum resistivity @xmath110 . for the impurity disorder we find that the semiclassical and quantum mean - free paths coincide , which is a standard result .",
    "however , for the edge roughness the semiclassical mean - free path strongly differs from the quantum one , showing that the diffusive transport in the wire with rough edges is not semiclassical .",
    "we show that it is semiclassical only if the roughness - correlation length is much larger than the fermi wave length . for such edge roughness",
    "the conductance behaves like the conductance of the wire with impurities ( formulae [ land - ballist - dif ] - [ varga ] ) , also showing the fluctuations .",
    "the next section describes the scattering - matrix calculation of the amplitudes @xmath56 for the impurity disorder and edge roughness . in section iii ,",
    "the impurity disorder and edge roughness are treated by means of the boltzmann equation and the semiclassical q1d conductivity expressions are derived . in section",
    "iv we show our numerical results . moreover ,",
    "the crossover from @xmath98 to @xmath100 in the wire with rough edges is derived by means of a microscopic analytical theory .",
    "the theory neglects localization but nevertheless captures the main features of our numerical results .",

    "we introduce the variable @xmath555 and simplify as @xmath556 to obtain the second line in , we have replaced the limits @xmath557 and @xmath558 in the first line by @xmath559 and @xmath560 , respectively . except for very small @xmath561 , such replacement is justified because @xmath562 decays with increasing @xmath563 to zero on the distance ( correlation length ) much smaller than @xmath7 .",

    "it might seem that the scattering has to be weak if @xmath7 is sufficiently small .",
    "however , the quasi - ballistic ( not ballistic ) regime is a meaningfull concept only if the length @xmath7 involves at least one edge step .",
    "even one edge step can scatter strongly if the step size is large .",

    "<S> we study electron transport in quasi - one - dimensional metallic wires . </S>",
    "<S> our aim is to compare an impurity - free wire with rough edges with a smooth wire with impurity disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the electron transmission through the wires by the scattering - matrix method , and we find the landauer conductance for a large ensemble of disordered wires . </S>",
    "<S> we first study the impurity - free wire whose edges have roughness with a correlation length comparable with the fermi wave length . simulating wires with the number of the conducting channels ( @xmath0 ) as large as @xmath1 - @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the roughness - mediated effects which are not observable for small @xmath0 ( @xmath3 - @xmath4 ) used in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> first , we observe the crossover from the quasi - ballistic transport to the diffusive one , where the ratio of the quasi - ballistic resistivity to the diffusive resistivity is @xmath5 independently on the parameters of roughness . </S>",
    "<S> second , we find that transport in the diffusive regime is carried by a small effective number of open channels , equal to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this number is universal - independent on @xmath0 and on the parameters of roughness . </S>",
    "<S> third , we see that the inverse mean conductance rises linearly with the wire length ( a sign of the diffusive regime ) up to the length twice larger than the electron localization length . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a theory based on the weak - scattering limit and semiclassical boltzmann equation , and we explain the first and second observations analytically . for impurity disorder </S>",
    "<S> we find a standard diffusive behavior . finally , we derive from the boltzmann equation the semiclassical electron mean - free path and we compare it with the quantum mean - free path obtained from the landauer conductance . </S>",
    "<S> they coincide for the impurity disorder , however , for the edge roughness they strongly differ , i.e. , the diffusive transport in the wire with rough edges is not semiclassical . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes semiclassical only for roughness with large correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> the conductance then behaves like the conductance of the wire with impurities , also showing the conductance fluctuations of the same size . </S>"
