    "massive stars form in associations or clusters together with hundreds of intermediate and low - mass stars @xcite . although it is still not conclusively proven that high - mass stars form the same way as low - mass stars , i.e. with accretion disks supporting accretion and driving outflows , recent theoretical models show that high accretion rates and the pressure from surrounding massive cloud cores are sufficient to overcome radiation pressure from a newly formed high - mass star , therefore allowing the stellar mass to increase far above the theoretical limit of 8  @xcite .",
    "recent surveys of high - mass star formation regions @xcite show that molecular outflows are common in high - mass young stars .",
    "accretion disks , however , are far more difficult to detect , because high - mass protostars are more distant and deeply embedded than low - mass stars , and since they form in clusters or small groups it is difficult to isolate and image disks around high - mass protostars , because of confusion and poor spatial resolution . yet , there are several results that show rather convincingly that high - mass protostars are surrounded by rotating accretion disks @xcite .",
    "the mass distribution of protostellar clumps in high - mass star forming regions also appears to be consistent with the stellar initial mass function @xcite , strongly supporting accretion as the dominant mechanism for forming high - mass stars .",
    "the molecular cloud bordering the large region ngc7538 to the se is known to contain several centers of active and on - going high - mass star formation @xcite . in the following",
    "we have adopted the distance to ngc7538 as 2.8 kpc @xcite , which is the most commonly used distance estimate , although we note that two photometric studies @xcite place ngc7538 at a distance of 2.2 kpc .",

    "irs9 is located @xmath3 2  se of the well studied hyper compact region irs1 .",
    "the source is associated with a large reflection nebula @xcite , drives a powerful extreme high velocity outflow @xcite , and shows only weak free - free emission @xcite , suggesting that it has not yet developed an region .",
    "there are several indications that irs9 may not be the only young stellar object in the irs9 cloud core .",
    "deep ccd imaging @xcite in r , i , and z filters revealed a diffuse nebula @xmath3 50  w of irs9 , which they identified as an hh object .",
    "@xcite found several knots of shocked h@xmath17 emission at 2.12 @xmath12 m , including a 40  collimated jet .",
    "neither the hh object nor the h@xmath17 jet appear to point back towards irs9 , suggesting that these are powered by other active young stellar objects embedded in the irs9 molecular cloud core .",
    "in this paper we present high angular resolution spectral line and continuum imaging of ngc7538irs9 with bima at 3.4 mm .",
    "we also present deep continuum imaging at 3.6 cm and additional data obtained from the vla archive .",
    "images in hco@xmath0 21 show that irs9 drives a compact bipolar high velocity outflow observed almost pole on .",
    "by re - analyzing published co 21 data together with our hco@xmath0 data , we detect at least two additional molecular outflows .",
    "one coincides with the h@xmath17 jet and is highly collimated ( axial ratio @xmath3 9 ) in blue - shifted hco@xmath0 emission .",
    "the second outflow is located in the dense cloud core south of irs9 and crosses the h@xmath17 jet .",
    "we derive properties of the outflows and discuss what this implies for the star formation activity in the seemingly isolated irs9 cloud core .",

    "the deep 3.6 cm vla observations with an angular resolution of 121 @xmath4 047 show a clear detection of a faint , marginally resolved source centered on irs9 ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "there are no other sources within 100  of irs9 . at 6  cm",
    "the free  free emission from irs9 is only a 3@xmath28 detection .",
    "however , since the 6  cm emission agrees well in position with the 3.6  cm emission , we consider it to be realiable .",
    "the flux density at 6  cm is comparable to the 3.6  cm data , suggesting a flat spectral index .",
    "such a flat spectral index is also found for the protostar ngc7538s ( sandell et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and most likely due to free - free emission from a well - collimated ionized wind @xcite .",
    "at 3.4  mm we find the continuum emission from irs9 to be a point - source surrounded by weak extended emission .",
    "the continuum peak agrees extremely well with our vla position ( fig .",
    "[ fig - cont ] , table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "since the free - free emission is very weak and has a spectral index @xmath3 0 , essentially all the emission at 3.4  mm must arise from thermal dust emission .",
    "the observed size of the dust emission is about twice as large as @xcite determined from single dish observations at 1.3  mm , 850 and 450 @xmath12 m , suggesting that most of the dust emission at 3.4 mm originates from the dense cloud core in which irs9 is embedded .",
    "we note that our results disagree with the results reported by @xcite , who found the dust emission to be unresolved in high spatial resolution ( @xmath3 2  beam ) ovro observations at 107 and 115 ghz ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "their flux densities , 43 and 95 mjy , at 107 and 115 ghz , respectively , are at least a factor of two higher than the current bima observations .",
    "if we extrapolate from the results quoted by @xcite , who derived a dust emissivity index , @xmath29 @xmath3 2 , the single dish observations predict a integrated flux density of @xmath3 18 mjy , much less than our integrated flux density of 85 mjy at 3.4  mm ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath29-index derived by @xcite is therefore likely to be overestimated .",
    "most protostellar sources have an apparent @xmath29-index of 1 to 1.5 @xcite , and a @xmath29-index of @xmath32 is not expected . in the following",
    "we assume that the @xmath29-index is 1.5 .",
    "if we assume that the dust emission is optically thin and that the bulk of the gas is at an average temperature , t@xmath30 , the total mass of gas and dust , m , can be expressed as @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the planck function , @xmath33 is the dust mass opacity , @xmath34 is the distance , and s@xmath35 is the integrated flux density at the frequency @xmath36 . for @xmath29 = 1.5 and a gas to dust ratio of 100",
    "we get @xmath37= 0.002 @xmath38 @xcite . a dust temperature , t@xmath30 of @xmath3 40  k seems to be appropriate , based both on the results by @xcite and the average gas temperature in the vicinity of irs9 , which is @xmath3 30  k @xcite . with these assumptions we find a total mass from the 3.4  mm dust emission of @xmath3 180 .",
    "if the @xmath29-index was as high as 2 , the mass would be about four times larger . since we find that irs9 drives a well - collimated molecular outflow ( section [ sect - flow ] ) , we assume that irs9 is surrounded by an accretion disk . in this case",
    "the disk is most likely represented by the unresolved point - source emission at 3.4  mm ( @xmath3 8 mjy ) , and not by the extended emission , which originates from the surrounding dense cloud envelope .",
    "our continuum observations therefore predict a disk  mass of @xmath320 .",
    "this estimate is quite uncertain , both due to the uncertainty in the flux density assigned to the disk , and because of the limited knowledge of the dust properties and dust temperature of the proposed disk .",
    "h@xmath1cn 10 and so 2@xmath2 are good tracers of high density gas , i.e. densities @xmath39 10@xmath40 cm@xmath9 . h@xmath1cn is a chemically robust molecule , i.e. its abundance is not strongly affected by shocks or temperature conditions",
    ". the emission should be optically thin and therefore provide an accurate image of the column density distribution of a dense molecular core as long as the gas temperature is fairly constant in the core .",
    "so , although quite abundant in molecular clouds , often shows a different column density distribution relative to other high density tracers , presumably due to chemical effects @xcite .",
    "the so abundance is also enhanced in molecular outflows @xcite , and can be significantly enhanced even in low - velocity shocks @xcite .",
    "hco@xmath0 traces somewhat lower gas densities , @xmath3 10@xmath7 cm@xmath9 , than h@xmath1cn and is expected to be optically thick .",
    "it is therefore not a reliable column density tracer , at least not for the very dense molecular cloud cores that surround young high - mass stars .",
    "furthermore the hco@xmath0 abundance is often enhanced in high - velocity outflows @xcite , and the high velocity gas may completely dominate , as is the case towards irs9 , see section [ sect - flow ] .",
    "nh@xmath17d 1@xmath42 traces primarily cold , pristine molecular gas @xcite .",
    "sandell et al .",
    "( 2005 , in preparation ) have detected nh@xmath17d in the ngc7538 molecular cloud towards the high - mass protostar ngc7538s and in the dust filaments east and west of ngc7538s .",
    "no nh@xmath17d emission is detected in the molecular cloud core near irs9 ; the irs9 core is therefore not likely to have a significant amount of cold , pristine gas .",
    "our observations show several regions of dense gas in the irs9 field ( fig .",
    "[ fig - h13cn - so ] ) .",
    "there is an extended cloud core se of irs9 .",
    "the star itself is embedded in a `` compact '' cloud core almost detached from the larger cloud . to the west , near the edge of our primary beam , there is a region of very strong , narrow so emission .",
    "high resolution images of nh@xmath21 @xcite show a very similar distribution , except that nh@xmath21 is largely absent towards irs9 , whereas we detect the strongest h@xmath1cn emission towards irs9 .",
    "the h@xmath1cn and so emission peak within @xmath3 1   of irs9 .",
    "the so emission appears more compact , and shows a fainter secondary peak @xmath3 5  w of irs9 ( fig [ fig - h13cn - so ] ) .",
    "the size of the h@xmath1cn emission , excluding high velocity gas , is @xmath3 18  @xmath4 8  extending ew , i.e. similar to the extent of the dust emission at 3.4  mm ( c.f .",
    "section [ sect - cont ] ) .",
    "the radial velocity determined from the main hyperfine transition of h@xmath1cn ( f = @xmath43 ) , @xmath3 @xmath2057 km  s@xmath11 , agrees well with that determined from observations of a number of transitions of cs and h@xmath17co @xcite .",
    "we resolve the hyperfine structure in h@xmath1cn and in addition to the f = @xmath43 transition we also observe the upper hyperfine transition , f = @xmath44 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - irs9-spectra ] ) , which for optically thin emission has a line intensity of 0.6 times the f = @xmath43 line .",
    "the f = @xmath45 hyperfine component may also be present , but is generally weak ( @xmath3 0.2 times the intensity of the f = @xmath43 transition for optically thin emission ) .",
    "since the f = @xmath44 hyperfine transition is only separated by @xmath194.9 km  s@xmath11 from the f = @xmath43 transition , the two lines often appear partially blended .",
    "we observe no obvious velocity gradient in either h@xmath1cn or so .",
    "both h@xmath1cn and so show high velocity wings ( fig .",
    "[ fig - irs9-spectra ] ) , confirming that the extreme high velocity outflow driven by irs9 has very high densities , at least at low and moderate velocities .",
    "the high velocity emission completely dominates in hco@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - irs9-spectra ] ) , which will be discussed in more detail in section [ sect - extreme - flow ] .    the single dish jcmt h@xmath17co data ( fig .",
    "[ fig - h2co ] ) give t@xmath25(@xmath27)/t@xmath25(@xmath26 ) = 3.5 @xmath46 0.3 , integrated over the central 3 km  s@xmath11 , suggesting a gas temperature @xmath14 60  k @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite derive a lower temperature of 32 @xmath46 8 k from analysis of the 32 and 43 transitions of hco@xmath0 and h@xmath1co@xmath0 , while @xcite , using absorption lines of the fundamental vibrational band of @xmath1co at 4.7 @xmath12 m , derived 26 k. the latter two studies therefore suggest that the temperature of the dense gas surrounding irs9 is @xmath3 30  k , while the h@xmath17co data suggest a substantially higher temperature .",
    "the other position observed in h@xmath17co , at ( @xmath1912,@xmath2035  ) in the southern cloud core gives t@xmath25(@xmath27)/t@xmath25(@xmath26 ) = 7.0 @xmath46 0.4 , corresponding to a gas temperature of @xmath3 30  35 k , in good agreement with the temperature derived by @xcite from hco@xmath0 data at the same position .",
    "however , since both h@xmath17co transitions show clear line wings towards irs9 , the emission from the hot outflow at near - cloud velocities add a substantial contribution to the line integral , causing an incorrect line ratio for the core emission .",
    "if we fit the h@xmath17co spectra with a two - component gaussian , one for the cloud emission and one for the broad wing emission , we find that a ratio of @xmath38 for the cloud core , corresponding to an average gas temperature of 30 k. in the follwing we adopt 30 k as the excitation temperature for h@xmath1cn , resulting in a column density towards irs9 of @xmath3 3.6  10@xmath1 @xmath47 . if we assume an abundance ratio for hcn similar to the omc-1 extended ridge @xcite , i.e. [ hcn]/[h@xmath13 = 5 10@xmath48 , and an isotope ratio , [ @xmath49c]/[@xmath1c ] = 85 @xcite , we find a total h@xmath17 column density of 6.1  10@xmath50 @xmath47 towards irs9 .",
    "if we assume that the relationship between color excess and total hydrogen column density @xcite is valid also for dense molecular gas , the observed column density suggests that irs9 is obscured by a visual extinction of more than 300@xmath51 , yet @xcite derived a visual extinction of only @xmath3 75@xmath51 from observations of the co absorption band at 4.67 @xmath12 m .",
    "these two estimates are not necessarily discrepant , because as we will show in section [ sect - extreme - flow ] , irs9 drives a well collimated high velocity outflow observed almost pole - on , clearing away enough of the foreground cloud to allow the star to be detectable in the near ir .",
    "if we integrate the h@xmath1cn emission over the irs9 cloud core we derive a total mass @xmath3 350 .",
    "this mass estimate is in good agreement with the value based on our continuum observations , 180  ( section [ sect - cont ] ) , especially considering that the the abundance ratio of [ h@xmath1cn / h@xmath13 is uncertain by at least a factor of two or three .",
    "our observations therefore show that irs9 is still surrounded by a very dense cloud core with a mass of @xmath39 100 .",
    "the molecular cloud core se of irs9 dominates the emission in h@xmath1cn and so .",
    "the core has a diameter of @xmath3 40   and shows several emission peaks .",
    "h@xmath1cn shows a ridge of emission in p.a .",
    "@xmath3 25  , with a strong peak at an offset @xmath3 ( 6 , @xmath2022 ) from irs9 ( fig [ fig - h13cn - so ] ) .",
    "another extended emission peak is observed at the se boundary of the h@xmath1cn cloud and is also distinctly visible on the 450 @xmath12 m scuba image ( fig .",
    "[ fig - h13cn+450 ] ) .",
    "it is barely detected in so , which otherwise exhibits a similar morphology ( fig .",
    "[ fig - h13cn - so ] ) .",
    "both h@xmath1cn and so show red- and blue - shifted wings towards the dominant emission peak at ( 6 , @xmath2022 ) ( fig [ fig - irs9-spectra ] ) , while hco@xmath0 shows deep red - shifted self - absorption .",
    "even h@xmath1cn is strongly affected by self - absorption .",
    "strong red - shifted self - absorption in hco@xmath0 is usually interpreted as evidence for infall or accretion towards a central protostellar object .",
    "since we also observe a bipolar outflow originating from this position ( section [ sect - flow ] ) , there must be a young protostar deeply embedded in this cloud core .",
    "a gaussian fit to the h@xmath1cn peak gives a size of 14  @xmath4 6   ( p.a .",
    "@xmath3 20 ) .",
    "if we assume the same gas temperature and h@xmath1cn abundance as used for the cloud core surrounding irs9 , a mass of @xmath5 250  for the compact cloud core surrounding the protostar is suggested .",
    "this is a lower limit , since we have made no correction for the self - absorption , which virtually blocks all emission at the cloud velocity ( fig [ fig - protostar ] ) .",
    "the average gas density of this protostellar core is therefore @xmath5 6  10@xmath52 cm@xmath9 .",
    "the large cloud core , in which this protostellar core is embedded , has a mass of @xmath5 900 , providing a large mass reservoir for additional star formation .",
    "we have have examined the h@xmath1cn and so data to see if there is any evidence for a rotating disk , which would be expected around such a young , heavily accreting protostar . however , based on the position velocity plot in fig .",
    "[ fig - protostar ] , the dense surrounding cloud core effectively obscures the protostar ; it is thus impossible to observe the central protostar in these molecular transitions .",
    "an improved  disk probe \" is therefore required , which is not obscured by the cold cloud envelope or the outflow , which may mask any kinematics of the disk .",
    "such a disk maybe observable in ch@xmath21cn or in higher rotational transitions of h@xmath1cn or dcn .",
    "however , since one can see high velocity emission from the dense outflow in h@xmath1cn 10 , and since the outflow appears to be hot ( sect .",
    "[ sect - temp ] ) , the outflow is likely to dominate , making h@xmath1cn a poor choice .",
    "dcn is usually not seen in outflows , but appears to be a good disk tracer ( sandell et al .",
    "2005 , in prep . ) and may therefore be a better choice than h@xmath1cn .",
    "h@xmath1cn and so avoid irs9s , the southern sub - mm source , which @xcite suggest might host another protostar .",
    "both h@xmath1cn and so seem to form almost a semi - shell around the eastern boundary of this sub - mm source ( fig .",
    "[ fig - h13cn+450 ] ) .",
    "the absence of molecular emission from irs9s is puzzling .",
    "one possibility is that this is an extremely dense , cold protostellar core , in which most molecules are frozen onto interstellar dust .",
    "however , if this is the case , we would expect to see nh@xmath17d emission , which is absent .",
    "if irs9s were a cold source , strong emission strong source at 1.3 mm and 850 @xmath12 m is expected .",
    "however , @xcite found it to be faint at these wavelengths .",
    "the other possibility is that irs9s is a hot source .",
    "we note that @xcite detected nh@xmath21 towards irs9s , and remark that the nh@xmath21 emission shows larger velocity dispersion and higher optical depth than the emission in the vicinity of irs9 .",
    "a plot of the line ratios of the ( j , k ) inversion transitions ( 2,2 ) and ( 1,1 ) presented by @xcite indicates that the gas is hotter towards irs9s .",

    "the irs9 outflow is also known to be very hot @xcite and since the column density of a molecule is approximately linearly dependent on the gas temperature , the mass of an outflow can be seriously underestimated if the outflow temperature is assumed to be the same temperature as the surrounding molecular cloud ; an assumption often made in outflow studies @xcite .",
    "below we discuss in more detail how we determined the temperature and the mass of the outflows , which have been used to derive most of the outflow parameters given in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "@xcite used their co 32 and 21 observations to deduce the gas temperature of the irs9 high velocity outflow .",

    "the apparent weakness of the blue - shifted co wing compared to the red - shifted wing is easily explained if we assume that the hot gas in the blue outflow is self - absorbed against colder high velocity gas , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "if the blue - shifted outflow was as cold as 40  k , we would not see any blue - shifted wing in the @xmath26 transition . for estimating outflow masses we will therefore adopt an excitation temperature of 180  k for the red- and the blue - shifted high velocity emission",

    "however , in this case the h@xmath17co hpbw is larger , 22 , and the high velocity emission seen in h@xmath17co must originate from the protostellar outflow , not the h@xmath17 jet , because only the protostellar outflow has outflow densities which are high enough to excite h@xmath17co in the outflow . for the h@xmath17 jet we therefore adopt an outflow temperature of 40  k , while we use 80  k for the protostellar outflow .",

    "the calibration of hco@xmath0 abundance relative to co is still subject to some uncertainty , especially since we compare high spatial resolution hco@xmath0 data to co , which is observed with a much larger beam ( 22 ) .",

    "inverse p cygni line profiles or line asymmetries consistent with a centrally condensed infalling cloud have been observed towards several massive star forming regions @xcite . in the earliest stages of the formation of a massive protostar",
    ", the central core may be colder or about the same temperature as the infalling envelope .",
    "the line profiles will therefore be more symmetric or even stronger on the red - shifted side .",
    "however , if the massive protostar drives a hot molecular outflow , self - absorption may be observed against the high velocity gas .",
    "both irs9 and the southern protostar show red - shifted self - absorption against the hot hco@xmath0 outflows driven by these stars .",
    "since irs9 drives an almost pole - on outflow , the outflow is expected to largely fill in any signature of accretion , and the self - absorption in hco@xmath0 is indeed much less pronounced than for the southern protostar ( fig .",
    "[ fig - irs9-spectra ] ) . towards the southern",
    "protostar we observe a deep , narrow , @xmath3 0.8 km  s@xmath11 wide self - absorption feature with a broad , @xmath3 4  5 km  s@xmath11 red - shifted shoulder ( fig .",
    "[ fig - irs9-spectra ] ) .",
    "examination of spectra and channels maps show that the narrow absorption feature is still detectable @xmath3 7 10  from the protostar , although it becomes even narrower in width , 0.5  0.8 km  s@xmath11 , while the fainter broad absorption is only detectable in the immediate vicinity of the protostar . at the position of the protostar the broad red - shifted absorption component is @xmath3 8.9 k  km  s@xmath11  beam@xmath11 , while the narrow component has an integrated intensity of 1.7  2 k  km  s@xmath11  beam@xmath11 .",
    "since the fwhm of the narrow component is @xmath3 10 , the total intensity is 7  8 k  km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the integrated intensity of the observed self - absorption gives an estimate of the mass of the infalling gas .",
    "if we assume optically thin gas with a temperature of 30 k , the mass is @xmath3 1.9 .",
    "this is a lower limit , since the optical depth of the infalling gas must be @xmath14 1 to be seen in absorption .",
    "if we assume that the time scale for accretion is about the same as for the outflow , i.e. @xmath3 9,300 yrs , the accretion rate for the southern protostar is @xmath14 2 10@xmath8 m@xmath10  yr@xmath11 .",
    "irs9 may have an even higher accretion rate , but at near cloud velocities the hco@xmath0 profile is completely dominated by the pole - on outflow . at the position of irs9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - irs9-spectra ] ) there is a narrow self - absorption feature centered on @xmath2053 km  s@xmath11 , i.e. red - shifted by @xmath3 4 km  s@xmath11 from the cloud core .",
    "inspection of spectra in the vicinity of irs9 show that the absorption is even broader ( @xmath3 4 km  s@xmath11 wide ) 5  to the east , corresponding to an integrated intensity of @xmath3 8 k  km  s@xmath11  beam@xmath11 .",
    "the velocity of the self - absorption at this position is @xmath3 @xmath2054 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "there is still some self - absorption 10  east of irs9 , but here the self - absorption is narrower and less red - shifted .",
    "the self - absorption profiles suggest higher infall velocities for irs9 than for the southern protostar .",
    "the absorption profiles also show some acceleration of the infalling gas near irs9 , but not as pronounced as towards the southern protostar .",
    "we can also get an estimate of the accretion rate using the observed mass outflow rates using the arguments outlined by @xcite .",
    "@xcite assume that the outflows are jet - driven and that the momentum of the outflow is equal to that of the internal jet .",
    "they also assume that the ratio of the mass loss rate and the accretion rate is about 0.3 , and are therefore able to derive mass accretion rates from the observed mass outflow rates . for irs9 and the southern protostar",
    "we derive mass accretion rates of 1.5 10@xmath8 and 7.9 10@xmath8 m@xmath10  yr@xmath11 .",
    "if the h@xmath17 jet also originates in the irs9 core , the accretion rate for irs9 would be considerably higher .",
    "both methods therefore suggest that the mass accretion rate is @xmath5 10@xmath8 m@xmath10  yr@xmath11 and is probably closer to 10@xmath9 m@xmath10  yr@xmath11 for irs9 and the southern protostar .",
    "such high accretion rates are more than sufficient to quench the formation of an ultra compact region @xcite , see also @xcite , explaining why we did not detect any vla sources in the irs9 region except irs9 .",
    "@xcite found a good correlation between centimeter continuum emission ( s@xmath35 ) and momentum flux ( f@xmath61 ) in low - luminosity outflow sources , with f@xmath61 @xmath62 s@xmath35@xmath63 .",
    "although the observed relationship appears valid for the irs9 outflow , it would predict even higher flux densities for the h@xmath17 jet and the protostellar outflow , both of which are non - detections at 3.6 cm . our observation suggest that this correlation is no longer valid for young high - mass outflows .",
    "h@xmath17o masers pinpoint the location of low and intermediate luminosity protostars , because the masers are excited in the protostellar disk or in dense clumps in the outflow in the immediate vicinity of the star .",
    "the irs9 field contains 3 h@xmath17o masers ( table [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "the first two coincide within 1  with irs9 and are most likely dense clumps of shocked gas in the high velocity outflow near irs9 .",
    "the third h@xmath17o maser is not associated with any known source in the irs9 region , nor is there any molecular outflow or shocked h@xmath17 emission at the position of the h@xmath17o maser .",
    "this h@xmath17o maser is probably excited by a low - mass protostar , which is too deeply embedded to be observed in the near - ir and too compact and faint to be detectable in dust - continuum .",
    "the class i or class ia methanol masers like ch@xmath21oh 7@xmath22 @xmath23 6@xmath24 a@xmath0 at 44 ghz , are thought to be associated with outflows from massive stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out high resolution studies of the ch@xmath21oh 8@xmath22 @xmath23 7@xmath24 a@xmath0 class ia masers in dr21 and dr21(oh ) and found these masers to be located along the interfaces between the outflows and cold dense ambient clouds .",
    "@xcite mapped the ch@xmath21oh 6@xmath17 @xmath23 6@xmath24 and 5@xmath17 @xmath23 5@xmath24 e transitions near 25 ghz in orion with the vla and found the ch@xmath21oh masers to be located near the interface of the high - velocity outflow and the surrounding dense gas , i.e. very similar to the results of @xcite for the dr21 complex .",
    "@xcite suggested that the methanol masers are formed behind shock fronts , and that these shock fronts are moving at right angles to the line of sight .",
    "the methanol masers in the irs9 region are all definitely associated with massive outflows , but the location and radial velocities of the masers suggest that they originate in the shearing layer between the outflow and the surrounding dense cloud , rather than in the bow - shocks driven by the outflow .",
    "the two masers , irs9-ch@xmath21oh(1 ) & ( 2 ) ( table [ tbl-2 ] ) are both located in the pole - on irs9 outflow ; one in the red and one in the blue outflow lobe .",
    "the third one , irs9-ch@xmath21oh(3 ) coincides with the h@xmath17 jet , also seen as a very highly collimated outflow in hco@xmath0 ( section [ sect - h2-jet ] ) .",
    "since their velocities are close to that of the ambient gas , it appears that they are excited in the shearing layer between the outflow and the surrounding molecular cloud .",

    "most oh 1720 mhz masers are found to be coincident with regions , where they often coincide with oh 1665-mhz and oh 1667-mhz masers as well as with class ii methanol masers @xcite .",
    "oh 1720  mhz masers , however , are also known to be associated with shock fronts from supernova remnants @xcite , and are in rare occasions observed in shocks associated with outflows from young stars @xcite .",
    "we detected a new oh 1720  mhz maser in the irs9 field ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .",
    "this oh 1720  mhz maser is located in the red - shifted outflow lobe of irs9 and appears to be one of the rare oh 1720  mhz masers excited in the outflow of a young star . even though both class ia ch@xmath21oh masers and oh 1720  mhz masers are found to be excited by outflows from young stars ,",
    "they are not known to be spatially coincident , suggesting that the masing conditions must be different .",

    "we also detected irs9 in dust continuum at 3.4 mm as an extended ( @xmath315 ) source centered on irs9 .",
    "\\3 ) we resolve the previously known high velocity emission into at least three separate bipolar outflows .",
    "irs9 drives a highly collimated extreme high - velocity outflow observed nearly pole - on .",
    "the second outflow , the h@xmath17 jet , is equally highly collimated and jet - like and even more massive and energetic than the irs9 outflow .",
    "this outflow is most likely powered by an unseen object close to irs9 .",
    "the third outflow is the most massive outflow in the irs9 region and has an outflow mass of @xmath3 75 .",
    "the outflow has very high gas densities ; the outflow is observed even in h@xmath1cn .",
    "the center of symmetry for this outflow coincides with a strong , relatively compact h@xmath1cn peak in the southern core with a mass @xmath14 250 , which appears to host a very young massive protostar .",

    "\\7 ) the three class i methanol masers discovered in the irs9 region all coincide with massive , high velocity outflows .",
    "since the methanol masers have radial velocities close to the cloud velocity , it seems that they are most likely excited in the shearing layer between the high velocity gas and the ambient cloud .",
