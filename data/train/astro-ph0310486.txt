    "the particles are constrained to move strictly along the field lines , owing to the super - strong magnetic field that the gyration of the particles are almost suppressed .",
    "the equation of motion for a charged particle moving along the rotating field line is given by gangadhara ( 1996 ) .",

    "the equation of motion of a charged particle along a rotating magnetic field line is given by ( gangadhara 1996 ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the relativistic electron mass , @xmath2 is the rest mass , c is the speed of light , @xmath3 is the lorentz factor , @xmath4 is the effective angular velocity of the particle , and @xmath5 we have solved this equation and obtained the analytical solution : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the jacobian elliptical cosine function ( abramowitz @xmath8 stegun ) , @xmath9 @xmath10 the initial particle injection point , @xmath11 the distance between magnetic pole and rotation axis in the projected 2d plane , @xmath12 the initial injection angle with respect to meridional plane , @xmath13 the angular velocity of the pulsar , k is an integration constant , @xmath14 is a dummy variable , @xmath15 is the angle that the line of sight makes with the 2d plane . using the expression for the r an approximate value for @xmath16",
    ", the radius of curvature of the particle in the lab frame , is found out to be @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the light cylinder radius .    for a pulsar with period of 1 s , we estimated the components of the electric field of radiation and hence the stokes parameters . in fig .  1a ,",
    "we have plotted the intensity @xmath19 , linear polarization @xmath20 and in fig .",
    "1b circular polarization @xmath21 is plotted .",
    "due to aberration - retardation phase shift the profile is asymmetric about the center @xmath22 of the profile",
    ". it also shows that leading part of the profile is stronger than trailing part . since line of sight stays above or below the plane of particle trajectory ,",
