    "in quantum phase space methods , operators in a hilbert space are mapped to functions in a `` mock '' phase space  @xcite .",
    "one example is the wigner representation which is particularly useful for establishing quantum - classical correspondence . in the wigner representation ,",
    "the wigner function represents a density matrix operator @xmath1 with a quasi - probability distribution in classical phase space .",
    "the wigner functions are conveniently applied in semiclassical methods  @xcite , to visualize or characterize quantum states , and experimentally allows one to recover information of quantum systems through tomographic measurements of their phase - space distributions  @xcite .    in the related weyl function representation",
    "@xcite , the hilbert space operators are mapped to functions in a `` reciprocal phase space '' where each function is simply a fourier transform of those in the wigner representation . in particular ,",
    "weyl function @xmath2 is the fourier transform of the wigner function @xmath3 over the phase space coordinates  @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the weyl function can also be expressed as : @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the position and momentum operators , and @xmath8 is the displacement operator  @xcite , that shifts the density matrix by @xmath9 in momentum and @xmath10 in position . thus the weyl function @xmath2 is a phase - space correlation function that measures the coherence of matter - waves . though both weyl and wigner functions completely specify any density matrix operators , application of weyl function , or the fourier transform of the wigner function , has been much less discussed before  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate the power of the weyl function technique by applying it to an important class of wave interference phenomena , the talbot - lau effects associated with matter - waves in quadratic or periodic potentials .",
    "various examples of talbot - lau type interference , including those closely related to recent experiments  @xcite , are discussed . to our knowledge",
    ", this work gives the first vectorial and diagrammatic formula of talbot - lau effects .",
    "apart from the expected application in matter - wave optics , the formula may also provide a convenient framework for the design of various lens - less imagine systems  @xcite .",
    "periodic light wavefronts can repeatedly reconstruct themselves during free propagation .",
    "the phenomena is known as the talbot effect that was discovered by henry f. talbot  @xcite in 1836 .",
    "a demonstration of the talbot effect usually starts with a collimated monochromatic light with wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "the light passes through a transmission grating with a grating constant @xmath12 to generate a periodic wavefront .",
    "full or partial re - constructions of the transmission wavefront at integer or fractional multiples of the talbot distance @xmath13 are observed downstream .",
    "many intricate and elegant features of the talbot phenomena have been discussed in the literature  @xcite . instead of using a collimated or spatially coherent input , in 1948 ernst lau  @xcite found that spatially incoherent light , propagating through two gratings with same grating constant @xmath12 separated by a distance @xmath14 , can generate an interference pattern at the focal plane of a lens ( fraunhofer diffraction ) placed downstream from the second grating .",
    "the contrast of the interference is maximized if @xmath14 takes integer multiples of @xmath15 .",
    "more general than fraunhofer diffraction , in the lau effect the interference pattern appears at a distance @xmath16 downstream from the second grating where @xmath17 are two integers .",
    "lau s original discovery corresponds to @xmath18  @xcite .    instead of using light waves , both the talbot  @xcite and the lau effects",
    "@xcite have been demonstrated using matter - waves and in particular using neutral atoms .",
    "interferometry with multiple gratings using the lau effect is referred to as talbot - lau or talbot - vonlau interferometry ( tli ) .",
    "the lau effect is of particular interest for observing matter - wave interference in the circumstances where a bright and collimated matter - wave input is not available .",
    "talbot - lau interferometers are used to demonstrate wave properties of atoms and molecules  @xcite , to study decoherence  @xcite and to measure the polarizability of large molecules  @xcite .",
    "talbot - lau interferometers have also been explored to sense inertial forces with matter - waves  @xcite .    based on fresnel diffraction",
    ", matter - wave talbot and lau effects can also happen in the time domain instead of in the spatial domain , due to the equivalence of schdinger s equation and the paraxial wave equations .",
    "matter - wave talbot  @xcite and lau  @xcite effects in the time domain have been observed with atoms cooled down to a thermal velocity of centimeters per second or lower . in the time domain , spatially",
    "separated gratings are replaced by successive pulses of optical standing waves acting as either phase or amplitude gratings for the matter - waves .",
    "time - domain interferometry using optical standing wave pulses with laser - cooled atoms were pioneered by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite . in that experiment ,",
    "off - resonant standing wave pulses act as thin phase gratings to an atomic cloud . after each standing wave pulse the atoms bunch to the potential minima of the standing wave to form a density grating .",
    "the density grating washes out due to velocity spreading of atoms . however , with two successive standing wave pulses separated by time @xmath19 applied to atoms , the atomic density grating revives around time @xmath20 if @xmath21 and more generally if @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an integer .",
    "the contrast of the revived density grating is a periodic function of @xmath19 , similar to the spatial lau effect .",
    "the revived atomic density grating is probed using a bragg - scattering of a probe light to induce a grating echo  @xcite , and the interferometry based on this setup is referred as a time - domain grating echo interferometer  @xcite .",
    "experiments and the theory of the interferometry were further developed in ref .",
    "@xcite that generalizes the technique to include multiple standing wave pulses .",
    "recently a direct spatial image of sub - wavelength spatial interference pattern due to the lau effect after two standing wave pulses ( act as either amplitude or phase gratings ) is achieved using an on - resonant standing wave mask  @xcite .",
    "developed theories of matter - wave talbot - lau effect ( tle ) usually simplify the analysis by making particular assumptions on the coherence properties of input matter - waves .",
    "closely related to the spatial ( beam ) talbot - lau setup with amplitude transmission gratings , in the first approach  @xcite the atom flux through each opening of the first grating are treated essentially as individual point sources , from which the fresnel diffraction on the image plane is calculated .",
    "an incoherent sum of the contribution from all the openings at the @xmath24 grating gives the final interference pattern .",
    "instead of incoherent summation of point sources , the second approach  @xcite assumes the input atoms as an incoherent sum of plane waves .",
    "however , a general theory of talbot - lau interferometry applicable to matter - waves with arbitrary initial spatial coherence hasnt been presented in the literature .    the approach to tle in this work",
    "is motivated by an obvious link between the weyl function [ eq .",

    "2 ) as we will see , the equation of motion for @xmath33 due to pulsed periodic potentials , during free - propagations and due to a quadratic potential can be integrated easily . since our analysis",
    "is generally applied to different types of interferometers using tle , we shall generally consider an interferometry configuration using tle as a talbot - lau interferometer , that will be referred to with the abbreviation tli in this work .      in what follows",
