    "the brownian motion of a particle in a confined system represents an essential model used in description of stochastic transport through quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems , e.g. channels in nanomaterials , pores or fibers in biological structures . in a 1d system ,",
    "the trajectory @xmath3 of a brownian particle is described by the langevin equation @xmath4 here , @xmath0 denotes mass of the particle , @xmath5 represents the driving potential , @xmath6 is an effective friction coefficient and @xmath7 is the stochastic force , satisfying the usual conditions on averaged values , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is the temperature and @xmath11 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the corresponding phase space density @xmath12 of the particle satisfies the fokker - planck ( fp ) , or kramers ( kinetic ) equation , @xmath13 where @xmath1 is the spatial coordinate , @xmath14 denotes its velocity and @xmath15 is the inverse temperature .",
    "solutions of the langevin equation , as well as the corresponding kinetic equation , are studied over almost a century @xcite .",
    "still , motion of a particle in confined geometries represents usually a complicated problem , requiring next reductions of the used description . due to simplicity , and often for relevance , mainly the overdamped limit is studied . the mass dependent term in eq . ( [ 1.1 ] ) , @xmath16 ,",
    "is then considered negligible and the particle s spatial density @xmath17 is governed by the smoluchowski equation , @xmath18 containing no information about the mass of the particle ; @xmath19 denotes the diffusion constant . instead of the full phase space ,",
    "one works with only the spatial coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "of course , the question is the price for this simplification , as well as possibility of also including properly inertia of the massive particles in the reduced ( real space only ) description of the brownian dynamics .",
    "recent studies showed its importance in understanding rectification of the transport in ratchets @xcite , or its influence on the effective diffusion coefficient @xcite in a narrow channel .",
    "for our purpose to demonstrate the phase space reduction , we will deal here with only the 1d fp ( kramers ) equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) is reducible to the smoluchowski eq .",
    "( [ 1.3 ] ) in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "the reduction procedure @xcite is based on an instant thermalization of the particle s velocity after any move in the @xmath1 direction in the case of an infinitely small mass .",
    "the situation resembles derivation of the fick - jacobs ( fj ) equation @xcite , @xmath20 appearing as the result of the dimensional reduction of the diffusion equation in a 2d channel with varying cross section @xmath21 , onto the longitudinal coordinate @xmath1 , if equilibration in the transverse ( @xmath22 ) direction is instant . the function @xmath17 denotes the linear ( 1d ) density of the particle",
    "of course , as in reduction of diffusion to the fj equation , that of ( [ 1.2 ] ) to ( [ 1.3 ] ) as @xmath2 is a singular limit , and must be handled with care , but from the viewpoint of the reduction of ( [ 1.1 ] ) , no such caveat is needed .    recently , an exact mapping procedure was proposed @xcite , enabling us to also derive the corrections to the fj equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) , which are necessary , if the transverse equilibration is not instant .",
    "the key was to introduce anisotropy of the diffusion constant in the diffusion equation , @xmath23 governing the 2d ( spatial ) density @xmath24 . for @xmath25 , the infinitely fast transverse diffusion immediately flattens the @xmath22 profile of @xmath26",
    ". then integration of eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) over the cross section , together with the reflecting boundary conditions satisfied at the hard walls , results in the fj eq .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) . in the case of a slower transverse diffusion ,",
    "the mapping procedure generates a series of corrections to the fj equation controlled by @xmath27 , developing the @xmath22 profile of @xmath24 , which is already curved depending on the flux and geometry of the channel .",
    "the procedure was extended to mapping of diffusion in an external field @xmath28 , e.g. for diffusion in a channel with soft walls @xcite , where the particle is kept near the @xmath1 axis by the parabolic potential , @xmath29 ; @xmath30 represents the varying stiffness of the walls .",
    "the equation to be mapped onto the @xmath1 coordinate is the 2d smoluchowski equation , @xmath31 integrating over @xmath22 and applying the mapping scheme gives the mapped 1d equation in an extended smoluchowski form , @xmath32\\partial_xe^{v(x)}p(x , t),\\ ] ] governing the 1d density @xmath17 , where @xmath33 stands for an effective potential and @xmath34 is the correction operator sought as an expansion in the small parameter @xmath35 .",
    "the potential @xmath33 and the coefficients of @xmath34 depend on @xmath30 and both are fixed unambiguously within the recurrence mapping procedure .",
    "the central idea of this paper is a conjecture that the fp eq .",
    "( [ 1.2 ] ) can be reduced to an extended smoluchowski - like 1d form , governing the spatial density @xmath17 , after integration over @xmath14 and applying a similar mapping scheme .",
    "the velocity @xmath14 thus represents a `` transverse '' coordinate instead of @xmath22 , with the mass @xmath0 playing the role of the small parameter @xmath35 . then the smoluchowski equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) should be obtained in the limit @xmath2 @xcite . performing the recurrence procedure , a series of corrections to this equation in powers of @xmath0",
    "would be derived .",
    "then the final mapped equation would also respect inertia of the brownian particles , although working only in real space .",
    "use of the mapping procedure developed for diffusion @xcite is not straightforward ; the left - hand side operator of the fp equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) has a different structure than that of the diffusion ( [ 1.5 ] ) or smoluchowski equation ( [ 1.6 ] ) .",
    "still , there is a way to apply the general scheme of the mapping in this case and to perform reduction of the phase space onto the real space in the way described above .",
    "presentation of this algorithm is the primary aim of this study .",
    "the result of the mapping of the fp equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) is again an equation of the form ( [ 1.7 ] ) with @xmath36 and @xmath35 replaced by @xmath0 . in the limit of stationary flow",

    "iii , our considerations are verified on an exactly solvable model , the fp equation with no field , @xmath43 .",

    "finally , the complete mapping procedure for an arbitrary potential @xmath5 is presented in sect .",
    "the mapped equation of type ( [ 1.7 ] ) , as well as the formula ( [ 1.9 ] ) is derived , and checked on the damped linear harmonic oscillator .",
    "the key points of the mapping procedure , as formulated for diffusion @xcite , are recalled in this section . based on physical considerations , we adjust the general scheme of the mapping for dimensional reduction of the fp equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) to this situation .",
    "the mapping procedure represents a consistent transition from a fine grain to a coarse grain description of some evolution process .",
    "the process is described in details by some partial differential equation ( pde ) , governing the density of particles @xmath44 in the full space , defined by the coordinates @xmath45 .",
    "the dimensional reduction projects this equation onto another pde , which governs the density @xmath17 in the reduced space of the coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath1 is one of the coordinates of the full space , @xmath46 , and the mapping accomplishes integration over the transverse coordinates @xmath47 . in the case of the fp equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) , phase space @xmath48 represents the full space and the dimensional reduction integrates over the `` transverse '' coordinate , the velocity @xmath14 .",
    "hence we have the defining relation between the densities @xmath49 and @xmath50 : @xmath51 the phase - space density @xmath12 is expected to be near the thermodynamic equilibrium and so approximately proportional to @xmath52 , which provides convergence of the integral in eq .",

    "this relation enables us to complete integrations in eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) and get the evolution equation for @xmath61 , together with the 1d mass conservation , in closed form .",
    "the initial task is to find the zeroth order approximation , valid in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "our first proposal for such a relation between @xmath12 and the reduced space quantities @xmath50 and @xmath57 is based on the following physical construction :    for an infinitely small mass of the particle , the stochastic force thermalizes its velocity @xmath14 almost immediately after any move along the spatial coordinate @xmath1 . similar to the transverse equilibration of the 2d density of a particle diffusing in a narrow channel with biasing transverse force @xcite , one could try the formula with separated boltzmann factor in the fast relaxing `` direction '' @xmath14 , @xmath62 .",

    "the calculation presented shows that the smoluchowski equation ( [ 1.3 ] ) is related to the fp equation ( [ 1.2 ] ) in the same way as the fick - jacobs equation @xcite to the diffusion equation valid in a narrow 2d channel .",
