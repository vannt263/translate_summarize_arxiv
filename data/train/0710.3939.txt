    "the skyrme model @xcite is an su(2)valued non - linear theory for pions in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions with topological soliton solutions called skyrmions . apart from a kinetic term",
    ", the lagrangian of the model contains a ` skyrme ' term which is of the fourth order in derivatives , and is used to introduce scale to the model @xcite .",
    "the existence of stable solutions in the skyrme model is a consequence of the nontrivial topology of the mapping @xmath7 of the physical space into the field space at a given time , @xmath8 where the physical space @xmath9 is compactified to @xmath10 by requiring the spatial infinity to be equivalent in each direction .",
    "the topology which stems from this one - point compactification allows the classification of maps into equivalence classes , each of which has a unique conserved quantity called the topological charge .",
    "the skyrme model has an analogue in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions known as the baby skyrme model , also admitting stable field configurations of a solitonic nature @xcite . due to its lower dimension",
    ", it serves as a simplification of the original model , but nonetheless it has a physical significance on its own , having several potential applications in condensed - matter physics @xcite .",
    "the target manifold in the baby model is described by a three - dimensional vector @xmath11 with the constraint @xmath12 . in analogy with the @xmath13d case ,",
    "the domain of this model @xmath14 is compactified to @xmath15 yielding the topology required for the classification of its field configurations into classes with conserved topological charges .",
    "the lagrangian density of the baby skyrme model is given by : [ eq : babylag ] = 12 _ ^ - -u(_3 ) and consists analogously of a kinetic , the skyrme and a potential term .",
    "while in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions the latter term is optional @xcite , its presence in the ( 2 + 1)d model is necessary for the stability of the solutions . aside from the requirement",
    "that the potential vanishes at infinity for a given vacuum field value ( normally taken to be @xmath16 ) , its exact form is arbitrary and gives rise to a rich family of possible baby - skyrme models .",
    "three specific potentials have been studied in detail in the literature .",
    "the simplest is the holomorphic model with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "it is known to have a stable solution only in the charge ",
    "one sector . the model with the potential @xmath18 ( commonly referred to as the ` old ' model ) has also been extensively studied .",
    "this potential gives rise to very structured non - rotationally - symmetric multi - skyrmions @xcite .",
    "another model with @xmath19 produces ring - like multi - skyrmions @xcite .",
    "other double  vacuum potentials which give rise to other types of solutions have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the brief review given above indicates that the form of the potential term has a decisive effect on the properties of the minimal energy configurations of the model . to gain better insight into this matter , in this paper",
    "we study the multisolitons of the baby skyrme model for the one ",
    "parametric family of potentials @xmath1 with @xmath2 which generalizes previously studied cases . setting @xmath3 yields the  old  model ,",
    "whereas @xmath4 corresponds to the holomorphic model .",
    "although at this time the physical motivation for these generalizations is not yet fully clear , we show that it nonetheless yields interesting results .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath5 has dramatic effects on the static solutions of the model , both quantitatively and qualitatively , in the sense that it can be viewed as a ` control ' parameter responsible for the repulsion or attraction between skyrmions .",
    "in the present work , we find the static multisolitons of the baby skyrme model whose lagrangian density is given by : [ eq : babylagfamily ] = 12 _ ^ - ( ( _ ^ ) ^2 - ( _ _ ) ( ^ ^ ) ) -^2 ( 1-_3)^s .",
    "the model contains three free parameters , namely @xmath20 and @xmath5 .",
    "since either @xmath21 or @xmath22 may be scaled away , the parameter space of this model is in fact only two dimensional .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to study the effects of these parameters on the static solutions of the model within each topological sector .    the multi  skyrmions of our model are those field configurations which minimize the static energy functional within each topological sector . in polar coordinates the energy functional is given by [ eq : o3energy ] e = r r ( 12 ( _ r _ r + 1r^2 _ _ ) + + ^2 ( 1-_3)^s ) .",
    "the euler  lagrange equations derived from the energy functional ( [ eq : o3energy ] ) are non  linear _ pde _ s , so in most cases one must resort to numerical techniques in order to solve them . in our approach , the minimal energy configuration of a baby skyrmion of charge b and a given set of values @xmath23",
    "is found by a full  field relaxation method , described in more detail below .",
    "one of our objectives is the study of spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry by the static solutions . to avoid a possible bias from the use of a rectangular grid in cases in which the rotational symmetry of the solution is broken ,",
    "a polar grid has been used ",
    "@xmath24 grid points for the radial coordinate and @xmath24 points for the angular coordinate . for numerical convenience , the physical @xmath14 plane is further compactified into the unit circle by transforming to a truncated radial coordinate [ eq : truncr ] = ^-1(r/ ) with @xmath25 .",
    "the relaxation process begins by initializing the field triplet @xmath11 to a rotationally  symmetric configuration [ eq : initconfig ] _",
    "= ( f(r ) b , f(r ) b , f(r ) ) , where @xmath26 is the topological charge of the baby ",
    "skyrmion in question and the profile function @xmath27 is set to @xmath28 .    the energy of the baby ",
    "skyrmion is then minimized by repeating the following steps : a point @xmath29 on the grid is chosen at random , along with one of the three components of the field @xmath30 .",
    "the chosen component is then shifted by a value @xmath31 chosen uniformly from the segment @xmath32 $ ] where @xmath33 initially .",
    "the field triplet is then normalized and the change in energy is calculated .",
    "if the energy decreases , the modification of the field is accepted and otherwise it is discarded .",
    "the procedure is repeated while the value of @xmath34 is gradually decreased throughout the procedure .",
    "this is done until no further decrease in energy is observed .",
    "one undesired feature of this minimization scheme is that it can get stuck at a local minimum .",
    "this problem can be resolved by using the `` simulated annealing '' algorithm @xcite , which in fact has been successfully implemented before , in obtaining the minimal energy configurations of static two and three dimensional skyrmions @xcite .",
    "the algorithm comprises of repeated applications of a metropolis algorithm with a gradually decreasing temperature , based on the fact that when a physical system is slowly cooled down , reaching thermal equilibrium at each temperature , it will end up in its ground state .",
    "this algorithm , however , is much more expensive in terms of computer time .",
    "we therefore employ it only on a representative sample of the parameter space , just as a check on our results , which correspond to a metropolis algorithm of zero temperature .    as a further verification",
    ", we set up the minimization scheme using different initial configurations and grids of different sizes ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) for several @xmath37 and @xmath5 values .",
    "this was done to make sure that the final configurations are independent of the discretization and cooling scheme .",
    "accuracy was also verified by checking conservation of the topological charge @xmath26 throughout the minimization process , yielding @xmath38 .",
    "using the minimization procedure presented in the previous section , we have found the static solutions of the model for @xmath0 . since the parameter space of the model is effectively two dimensional ( as discussed in section [ sec : method ] ) , without loss of generality we fixed the potential strength at @xmath39 throughout , and scanned the @xmath5@xmath21 parameter space in the region @xmath2 and @xmath40 .      in the charge ",

    "three skyrmions was also found to be @xmath5 dependent . for any tested value of @xmath21 in the range @xmath40 , we have found that above @xmath6 , no stable charge ",
    "three solutions exist ; in this region the skyrmion breaks apart into individual skyrmions drifting further and further away from each other .    in the @xmath55 region , where stable solutions exist , the energy distribution of the charge ",
    "three skyrmion was found to be highly dependent on both @xmath5 and @xmath21 . keeping @xmath21 fixed and varying @xmath5 , we have found that in the small @xmath5 regime , ring  like rotationally  symmetric configurations exist .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath5 resulted in stable minimal energy configurations with only @xmath56 symmetry , corresponding to three partially  overlapping charge ",
    "one skyrmions in a row , as shown in figures [ fixedkappab3b ] and [ fixedkappab3c ] .",
    "the energy of the charge - three skyrmion also has a minimum in @xmath5 , at around @xmath57 ( as shown in figure [ fig : s123 ] ) . at @xmath6 the energy of",
    "the skyrmion becomes larger than three times the energy of a charge ",
    "one skyrmion and stable configurations are no longer obtainable .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fixedkappab3 ] which shows contour plots of the energy distribution of the @xmath58 skyrmion for different values of @xmath5 and fixed @xmath21 .",
    "for @xmath43 ( figure [ fixedkappab3a ] ) , the solution is rotationally symmetric and for @xmath59 and @xmath3 ( figures [ fixedkappab3b ] and [ fixedkappab3c ] respectively ) the rotational symmetry of the solution is broken and only @xmath56 symmetry remains . at @xmath60 , no stable solution exists .",
    "the latter case is shown in figure [ fixedkappab3d ] which was taken while the distance between the individual skyrmions kept growing .",
    "the dependence of the skyrmion solutions on the value of @xmath21 with fixed @xmath5 has also been studied .",
    "qualitatively , for small @xmath21 the minimal energy configurations are rotationally  symmetric . increasing its value results in an increasingly larger rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fixedsb3 ] .",
    "to better appreciate the effects of the parameters of the model on the obtained solutions , we introduce the following measure for the breaking of rotational symmetry : ^2= ( 12 b ( r , ) r r ) ^2 -1 , where @xmath61 is the charge density of the skyrmion with rotationally  symmetric configurations corresponding to @xmath62 . in terms of this measure ,",

    "an illustrative example is given in figure [ contour45 ] , which shows the stable solutions that have been obtained in the @xmath71 case and the splitting of these skyrmions into their constituents in the @xmath4 case .",
    "we have studied the static solutions of the baby skyrme model for the one  parametric family of potentials @xmath72 . while skyrmions with charge one were found to be stable and rotationally ",
    "symmetric for all tested values of @xmath21 and @xmath5 , the symmetries and stability of the minimal energy configurations of skyrmions with higher charge were found to be strongly dependent on the parameter of the potential .",
    "the charge  two skyrmion was found to be ring  like and rotationally  symmetric but only for @xmath50 , implying that in this regime , there exists a strong attraction between the individual skyrmions . above @xmath6 , the two ",
    "skyrmion breaks apart into one  skyrmions which repel each other and as a result drift infinitely apart .    for the @xmath73 skyrmions , small values of @xmath5 yielded in general rotationally symmetric configurations ; implying that the attraction between the individual skyrmions is strong .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath5 resulted in stable configurations with broken rotational symmetry .",
    "this type of solutions implies only a moderate attraction between the constituent skyrmions , as this configuration may be viewed as three partially  overlapping charge ",
    "one skyrmions in a row . as in the @xmath49 case , for @xmath74",
    "no stable configurations exist .",
    "this is a consequence of a very strong repulsion between the skyrmions which drives them infinitely apart from each other .",
    "altogether , it seems that @xmath5 may be viewed as a ` control ' parameter for the strength of the attraction ( small @xmath5 values ) or repulsion ( large @xmath5 values ) between individual skyrmions .",
    "we also note here the locally stable solutions that have been obtained in the @xmath49 sector .",
    "we particularly note the locally stable two  skyrmion solution that has been found in the ` holomorphic ' @xmath4 case .",
    "this result stands in contradiction with previously known results @xcite where it has been found that no stable solutions exist in this case .",
    "this discrepancy is not fully understood and might be due to the differences between the method used in @xcite which is based on the time evolution of a system of two well separated skyrmions sent towards one another , and the current one , in which multisolitons are obtained in a rather different approach , namely , by minimizing the energy functional of the system .",
    "bearing in mind that the initial configuration in our minimization scheme is rotationally symmetric , it is possible that the minimization procedure ends up at a local rotationally ",
    "symmetric minimum , provided such a local minimum exists .",
    "we verified that the results of our minimization procedure are robust with respect to changes in the grid size and in the initial configuration .",
    "they were also verified using the `` simulated annealing '' . in most cases ( with some notable exceptions as discussed above ) , our results were also found to agree with previously known results whenever a comparison was available .",
