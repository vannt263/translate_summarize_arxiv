    "<S> when dealing with macroscopic objects one usually observes quasiclassical phenomena , which can be described in terms of quasiclassical ( or classical ) equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> recent development of the theory of quantum computation is based on implementation of the entangled states which do not have a classical analogy . using a simple example of a paramagnetic spin system </S>",
    "<S> we show that the entangled states can be detected in standard macroscopic experiments as a sharp deviation from quasiclassical motion .    </S>",

    "<S> 44420 , guadalajara , jalisco , mxico + @xmath2department of applied mathematics and physics , polytechnic university , + six metrotech center , brooklyn ny 11201    in this paper , we show that quantum entangled states which are used for quantum computation @xcite-@xcite can be observed , at low temperature , in a macroscopic system as a sharp deviation from a quasiclassical motion . </S>",
    "<S> consider , as an example , a solid which contains a dilute concentration of ions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which have nuclear spins , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , with different gyromagnetic ratios , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> ( those also can be electron spins with different @xmath9-factors , or electron and nuclear spins of the same ion . ) in a permanent magnetic field , @xmath10 , these two spins have different resonant frequencies , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the system can be approximately considered as an ensemble of of two - spin molecules , @xmath13 , and that the spins in each molecule interact via a weak ising interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of an individual molecule can be written as , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the interaction constant . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider the evolution of this system under the action of the electromagnetic pulse with the frequency @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of interaction between a molecule and the rotating magnetic field can be written as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the rabi frequencies of spins @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function of a two - spin molecule can be represented in the form , @xmath20 the evolution of the system is described by the schrdinger equation , @xmath21 ( we assume that the temperature is small in comparison with the zeeman splitting . ) in the rotating reference frame , we derive the time - independent equations of motion for complex amplitudes , @xmath22 , in ( 3 ) @xcite .    assume that the system is initially in the state , @xmath23 in this state , we have the following values of the average spins , @xmath24 @xmath25-direction , and the right spin ( 2 ) points in the positive @xmath26-direction ( the direction of the permanent magnetic field ) . </S>",
    "<S> so far , this is a quasiclassical state which corresponds to two spins positing in definite directions . </S>",
    "<S> now , we apply a @xmath27-pulse with the frequency @xmath28 which drives the transition @xmath29 . as a result of the action of this pulse , the system is transformed into the simplest entangled state , @xmath30 this state </S>",
    "<S> does not have a quasiclassical analogy . </S>",
    "<S> the average values of both spins are equal to zero in this state , @xmath31 in figs 1 and 2 ( on left side , labeled `` quantum '' ) we show the time evolution of average spins under the action of a @xmath27-pulse obtained from the equations for the amplitudes @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see in fig . 1 a monotonic decrease of the amplitude of precession of the left spin ( 1 ) from the initial value 0.5 to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the @xmath26-component of the left spin is very small ( less than @xmath32 ) but it also remains near zero at the end of a @xmath27-pulse . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , one can see that the @xmath26-component of the right spin ( 2 ) decreases monotonically from 0.5 to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath33-component reaches its maximum value , 0.25 , in the middle of the pulse , and then approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34-component is very small ( @xmath35 ) , and its amplitude sharply decreases at the end of the @xmath27-pulse . </S>",
    "<S> note , that extremely small oscillations of the @xmath34-component of the right spin remain after the action of the @xmath27-pulse , indicating that the @xmath27-pulse does not produce a perfect entangled state .    </S>",
    "<S> now we show that the quasiclassical evolution of a two - spin molecule drastically differs from the quantum evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion for the quasiclassical two - spin molecule can be written as , @xmath36 where the quasiclassical hamiltonian has the form , @xmath37 the right ( indicated as `` classical '' ) sides in figs 1 and 2 show the evolution of quasiclassical spins under the action of a @xmath27-pulse , for the initial conditions ( 6 ) of the average quantum spins , @xmath38 @xmath39 in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , one can see a stable precession of the left ( 1 ) spin in the @xmath40 plane of the rotating frame . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , one can see a very small deviation of the second spin from its initial position ( 11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so , for the classical two - spin molecule a @xmath27-pulse with the frequency @xmath28 does not influence significantly the dynamics of the spins . </S>",
    "<S> this situation can be easily understood . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for the initial conditions ( 11 ) , the frequency @xmath28 is not a resonant frequency . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the first spin is in the @xmath40 plane , and it does not produce an effective field for the second spin . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the resonant frequency for the second spin is @xmath41 rather than @xmath28 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the entangled states can be observed in the experiments with macroscopic systems by indicating a sharp deviation from the quasiclassical behavior . for a considered case of two - spin molecules a @xmath27-pulse with a sertain frequency does not influence significantly a classical dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> but in a quantum case , this @xmath27-pulse leads to the total vanishing of the longitudional and transversal magnitization of a macroscopic sample . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments on creation of entangled states in considered in this paper macroscopic systems require application only one @xmath27-pulse with a proper frequency . </S>",
    "<S> such kind of experiments can significantly improve our understanding of the properties of entangled states , their stability and effects connected with decoherence . </S>"
