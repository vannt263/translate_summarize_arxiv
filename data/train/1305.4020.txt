    "the large hadron colllider ( lhc ) announcements on discovery of the higgs boson ( ) like particle as analyzed by the cms@xcite and atlas@xcite collaborations have been highly encouraging for particle physicists who had been in search of the higgs boson through several decades . additionally , cdf and d0 experiments of the tevatron at fermilab also announced a result on @xmath22 where higgs boson is produced in the associated vector boson mode @xmath23/@xmath24@xcite . within the standard model ( sm)@xcite one can compute higgs production",
    "cross sections via different means as well as consider decay of higgs to various final products@xcite . for the production mode ,",
    "the main contributing sources are ( i ) gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) , ( ii ) vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and ( iii ) associated production with vector bosons ( v ) , where v generically stands for w and z - bosons .",
    "the decay channels which are directly concerned with detection and prediction of higgs mass , are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 etc . here",
    "@xmath30 refers to off - shell vector boson indicating @xmath31 .",
    "the two photon @xmath32 final state refers to loop induced processes involving w - boson and heavy fermions like @xmath33-quarks and @xmath34-lepton in the loop .",
    "the dominance of a heavier fermion rather than a lighter one is of course due to larger @xmath35 coupling .",
    "the recent lhc observations of higgs are associated with the following channels : @xmath28 , @xmath25  @xmath36 , @xmath26  @xmath37 .",
    "lhc observations in the di - photon and the 4-lepton decay channels indeed lead to the discovery of higgs boson with mass @xmath38125  gev at around @xmath39 level @xcite .",
    "the ongoing higgs search at lhc is very important because it may successfully probe the origins of electroweak symmetry breaking and it may also provide valuable information for scenarios beyond the standard model ( bsm ) of particle physics . undoubtedly , low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) has been a promising direction to travel in order to look for bsm effects in particle physics .",
    "the modest @xmath40 supersymmetric extension of sm , namely the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite has two higgs doublets and this leads to several higgs scalars .",
    "the mssm higgs states are : two cp - even neutral higgs scalar bosons @xmath41 and @xmath42 , one cp - odd neutral higgs scalar boson @xmath43 , and two charged higgs scalar bosons @xmath44  @xcite . although mssm has a large number of parameters , the higgs sector , while not considering any radiative corrections can be described by only a few parameters .",
    "apart from the experimentally determined mass of z - boson @xmath45 , these are : i ) @xmath46 , the pseudoscalar higgs mass parameter and ii ) @xmath47 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 give masses to down type of quarks and leptons and up type of quarks respectively",
    ". however , there can be a significant amount of radiative corrections to the masses of the higgs bosons and this causes a few other mssm parameters to be relevant like the parameters that are involved in top squark and to some extent bottom squark or even tau - slepton masses@xcite .",
    "mssm has a nice prediction of a 135  gev upper limit for the mass @xmath51 of the lightest higgs boson@xcite .",
    "finding the observed higgs boson to have a mass in the vicinity of @xmath52  gev at lhc is very exciting for pursuing susy as a scenario beyond the sm .",
    "the mssm higgs sector can be broadly divided into a decoupling and a non - decoupling zone@xcite .",
    "the former region corresponds to pseudoscalar mass @xmath46 becoming very large ( in practice above 300 gev or so ) . in this limit",
    ", @xmath53 becomes vanishingly small ( consequently @xmath54 ) .",
    "here , @xmath55 refers to the higgs mixing angle .",
    "the couplings like @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 are all proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 couplings are all proportional to @xmath69 . in the decoupling limit ,",
    "an obvious possibility is to interpret the newly observed state at around 125 gev as the light @xmath70-even higgs boson having sm - like couplings ( for details see refs.@xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "all other higgs bosons become much heavier than @xmath41 .",
    "the non - decoupling region on the other hand is specified by @xmath71 or @xmath72 becoming very small . in the lhc context",
    ", the non - decoupling region with @xmath53 becoming close to unity would mean larger coupling strength of @xmath42 with the electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "thus here we may explore the possibility of @xmath73   125 gev , instead of considering the lighter counterpart @xmath41 to correspond to the discovered boson . here the heavier higgs field @xmath42 would have sm - like couplings whereas the lighter higgs @xmath41 would have much weaker couplings to w and z - bosons , for details see ref.@xcite .",
    "we further consider @xmath51 to be in the vicinity of 98  gev in the light of an old result from lep collaborations in regard to @xmath74  with @xmath22 where the result indicated a possibility of seeing an excess of higgs - like events@xcite near the above value of mass .",
    "this excess came with a significance level of 2.3 times the standard deviations in the combined analysis of all the four lep experiments .",
    "it could not be explained via an sm - like higgs boson because of a low production cross section .",
    "considering the discovered higgs boson to be @xmath42 with @xmath75  gev rather than @xmath41 , mssm in principle , in its non - decoupling domain can accommodate @xmath51 at 98 gev .",
    "smaller @xmath72 , consequently smaller @xmath64 or @xmath76 couplings would be consistent with the lep data whereas @xmath42 with its sm - like couplings to vector bosons would provide us with consistent @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the four - lepton decay channels . in a pre - lhc period ,",
    "such a possibility of having @xmath79  gev in the context of the lep data was analyzed in ref.@xcite . in the recent time , in the ",
    "_ post - higgs at 125 gev ",
    "_ scenario the above inclusive lep - lhc higgs perspective of assuming @xmath51 at 98 gev along with @xmath80 at 125 gev in the context of mssm was analyzed in refs .",
    "we will refer the above as `` * inclusive lep - lhc higgs * '' ( * illh * ) scenario in this analysis .",
    "after the higgs discovery announcement in the summer of 2012 , there have been a few studies on nmssm@xcite which could easily accommodate the above illh physics@xcite .",
    "there also have been a few analysis that reported results in multiple higgs bosons near 125 gev@xcite or a combined lhc plus tevatron scenario of a 125  gev plus a 136  gev higgs bosons@xcite , both in the context of nmssm .    after the analyses of the refs.@xcite , stronger constraints came from cms@xcite and atlas@xcite for the decay of neutral higgs bosons @xmath81 to @xmath82 pairs . in mssm ,",
    "cms data excludes parameter zones with @xmath83  gev for @xmath47 approximately above 5.5 . as pointed out in ref.@xcite",
    "there is a drastic reduction in the above limit of @xmath47 for the same range of @xmath46 in comparison to the older result of 2011 @xcite .",
    "this forces us to concentrate our search of the illh scenario for @xmath84 . on the other hand",
    ", we must take into account the atlas analyzed constraint coming from @xmath85 events , where @xmath86 with @xmath87@xcite .",
    "this analysis indicates that , approximately for @xmath47 between 2 to 6 , parameter regions satisfying @xmath88  gev become disallowed . thus focusing on the two constraints from @xmath89 and @xmath87",
    ", we look for the illh scenario for a small range of @xmath47 namely @xmath90 . the lower limit of @xmath91 is chosen so as to be consistent with ref.@xcite , @xmath47 can indeed be smaller than 3 .",
    "thus a much general analysis may probe smaller values of @xmath47 than 3 . ] . with the range of @xmath47 to be searched becoming restricted as mentioned above in the aforesaid non - decoupling region of mssm for the illh scenario",
    ", one would require i ) @xmath92 to be sufficiently small so as to have a small @xmath93 coupling in order to account for the 98  gev data from lep and ii ) the heavier cp - even higgs bosons @xmath42 to be sm - like and be consistent with the lhc signals in di - photon , 4-lepton and @xmath26 channels .",
    "we also consider various low energy constraints .",
    "one of the most important constraints is @xmath94@xcite simply because of its inverse quartic relationship with the pseudoscalar mass @xmath46 .",
    "besides , we explore the role of other relevant constraints like @xmath95@xcite and @xmath96@xcite .",
    "we will also impose the cold dark matter ( cdm)@xcite constraint from planck experiment@xcite and compute the direct detection cross section of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) for scattering with a proton in relation to the results of the xenon100 experiment@xcite .",
    "however , we ignore the constraint due to muon @xmath97 in this analysis because although the deviation from sm is large , there are uncertainties in the evaluations of the hadronic contributions leading to significantly varying final limits@xcite .",
    "we plan our analysis to proceed in the following way . in section-[mssmdesc ] we discuss the mssm parameter scan strategy along with discussing different constraints to be imposed . in section-[alltheresults ] we show the results of our scanning in mssm parameter space in the light of the illh scenario along with a discussion on the most significant constraints on the mssm higgs sector . in the same section ,",
    "we then move on to discuss the possibility of having 98 gev as well as 125 gev higgs bosons in nmssm . in section-[collidersection",
    "] , we discuss the collider implications of this scenario and finally in section-[conclusionsection ] we summarize our results .",
    "as mentioned earlier , although the mssm higgs sector is specified only by a few parameters like @xmath46 and @xmath47 , it is due to the large radiative corrections to the higgs boson masses several mssm parameters , particularly the ones associated with the stop sector become important .",
    "the radiative corrections to @xmath98 is quantified as follows@xcite . @xmath99 . \\label{higgscor}\\ ] ] here , @xmath100 , @xmath101  gev , @xmath102 and @xmath103 refers to the running top - quark mass .",
    "@xmath104 stands for trilinear coupling for top - quark given at the electroweak scale .",
    "the running top - quark mass also includes qcd and electroweak corrections .",
    "one must however include the radiative corrections from sbottom and stau sectors for cases with large @xmath47 and/or very large @xmath105 .",
    "the importance of the latter comes from a @xmath106 dependence@xcite .",
    "we will particularly scan mssm parameter space reaching up to large values of @xmath107 without being concerned with any fine - tuning issue .",
    "hence , the contributions at least from the sbottom sector are hardly negligible .",
    "expressions of radiative corrections for heavier neutral higgs bosons and charged higgs bosons may be seen in ref.@xcite .    with the above importance of higgs related parameters of mssm connected to radiative corrections for higgs masses and the fact that we also would like to explore the parameter space that satisfy the xenon100 data@xcite , we select the following parameter ranges for scanning of mssm parameter space .",
    "we point out that many of the parameters that are important to satisfy the cdm relic density@xcite constraints do not have significant effects on the higgs sector or strongly interacting sectors that are relevant for higgs@xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the squark masses of the first two generations as well as slepton masses of all the three generations sufficiently heavy .",
    "this will obviously not affect the higgs masses whereas it will only avoid the possibility of lsp - slepton coannihilation scenarios for cdm constraint without any loss of generality .",
    "we generate approximately 70 million random points in the following combined range of parameters .",
    "@xmath108 among the sm parameters , we consider @xmath109  gev and @xmath110  gev .",
    "@xmath111 is varied within the above range following the argument of ref.@xcite .",
    "we scan the parameters within the above ranges of eq.[parameterranges ] while imposing lower limits on the sparticle masses@xcite and eliminating the possibility of having any charge and color breaking ( ccb ) minima@xcite .    while sketching out the valid parameter space we also consider the errors in the masses of two cp - even neutral higgs bosons .",
    "we consider a theoretical uncertainty amount of 3  gev in the higgs mass computation that arises out of uncertainties in the renormalization scheme , scale dependence , the same in higher order loop corrections up to three loops or that due to the top - quark mass@xcite .",
    "thus , we isolate the parameter space with the following limits for the higgs boson masses .",
    "@xmath112 we further require @xmath41 to have non - sm like couplings by demanding @xmath72 to be small .",
    "the observed lep excess@xcite approximately results into : @xmath113 we now focus on the primary production channels of higgs boson at the lhc and define the following ratios related to the gluon - gluon fusion and the vector boson fusion channels . @xmath114 and @xmath115 where , @xmath116 or @xmath117 and @xmath118 or @xmath29 . as we know that the production of higgs at the lhc is dominated by gluon - gluon fusion both in the context of sm , as well as in our parameter zone of interest of mssm",
    "however , detection of higgs bosons via @xmath119 and @xmath120 decays becomes nearly impossible when the higgs boson is produced via gluon - gluon fusion since it is likely to be overshadowed by di - jet events from qcd interactions . on the other hand , when higgs boson is produced in association with a vector boson ( @xmath121 ) ,",
    "also known as higgs - strahlung ( hs ) , with the gauge bosons decaying leptonically , it is relatively easy to tag the two @xmath122-jets to reconstruct the higgs mass .",
    "both atlas and cms have probed higgs signatures in this channel but with large uncertainties , which one would expect to be modified with enough data collected at the 14  tev lhc run .",
    "hence , we consider the higgs - strahlung process when computing @xmath123 for higgs boson signals decaying into pair of bottom quark . because of large uncertainties in these channels we refrain ourselves from imposing any limit on @xmath124 or @xmath125 in our analysis . rather , we only set a lower limit for @xmath126 : @xmath127 we now consider various low energy constraints .",
    "the experimental data from @xmath128 almost saturates the sm value that comes from @xmath129 loop@xcite . within mssm ,",
    "the dominant contributions come from @xmath130 and @xmath131 loops@xcite , the former having the same sign as that of the @xmath129 loop of sm .",
    "the chargino loop contribution is proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath133 , there can be cancellation or enhancement between the above loop contributions within mssm@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that in susy , @xmath95 may have an indirect but important contribution from a gluino - squark loop at the next - to - leading order level .",
    "this is primarily connected to the renormalization of yukawa couplings to down type of fermions .",
    "the corrections that can be summed to all order in perturbation theory relates to the supersymmetric quantum chromodynamic ( sqcd ) corrections to the mass of the bottom quark @xmath134 and this is proportional to @xmath135@xcite .",
    "this leads to alteration of the @xmath136 vertex leading to a correction to @xmath128 that comes with an opposite sign with respect to the leading order contribution of the @xmath130 loop@xcite .",
    "typically , the correction is seen as a required one for large values of @xmath137 .",
    "but in spite of @xmath47 being small in our analysis , the same correction is also very important because of large possible values for @xmath105@xcite .",
    "this next - to - leading order effect can potentially cancel the leading order effects from chargino or charged higgs loops@xcite . ] .",
    "the experimental result is @xmath138@xcite which at 3@xmath7 level leads to : @xmath139 next , as mentioned before , we must explore the effect of the limits from @xmath140 particularly because of its @xmath141 dependence while we probe a light @xmath46 scenario .",
    "the experimental ( lhcb ) and sm values are given by @xmath142@xcite .",
    "this is to be compared with the sm result @xmath143  @xcite . as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we combine the errors of lhcb data and sm result to obtain the following @xmath144 limits .",
    "@xmath145 we also take into account the combined constraint from @xmath146 from babar@xcite and @xmath147 from belle@xcite . with @xmath148",
    ", we find @xmath149 ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "typically , the above constraint may be effective for large @xmath47 and smaller charged higgs boson mass .",
    "the limits of @xmath150 however do not impose any significant constraint on the parameter space of our study .    finally , we take into account the cdm relic density limits recently provided by the planck@xcite collaboration , which at @xmath151 level reads , @xmath152 we also compute spin - independent direct detection lsp - proton scattering cross - section and compare with the xenon100 data@xcite .",
    "the spin - independent cross section depends on t - channel higgs and s - channel squark exchanges of which the former dominates unless the squark masses are close to that of the lsp@xcite .",
    "we note that in a thermal production scenario of dark matter we may have the following possibilities : i ) either the lightest neutralino constitutes the entire cdm relic density while corresponding to correct relic abundance satisfying planck data or ii ) it is just one of the candidates of a multicomponent dm combination with obviously a smaller relic density contribution from its own , below the lower limit of eq.[planckdata ] . for the latter scenario one has @xmath153 , where @xmath154 refers to the lower limit of eq.[planckdata ] . here",
    ", we should multiply with the fraction @xmath155 the lsp contributes to the total local density of dm to obtain the true event rate where @xmath156 denotes the local total dm density and @xmath157 means the dm density contributed by the lsp .",
    "thus , one conveniently defines the ratio as @xmath158@xcite .",
    "@xmath159 by definition is unity for scenarios with right abundance ( single component ) or over - abundance of dm .",
    "we search for the illh scenario within the phenomenological mssm parameter space corresponding to eq.[parameterranges ] .",
    "we use the code suspect ( version 2.41)@xcite for generating sparticle spectra and micromegas ( version 2.4.5 ) @xcite to compute neutralino relic density , lsp - nucleon direct detection cross - section as well as various b - physics related quantities .",
    "we compute relevant higgs decays by using the code susy - hit@xcite .    in fig.[ma - tanbeta ] we show the result of our parameter space scanning in @xmath160 plane .",
    "the results show parameter points in the above plane that satisfy i ) the sparticle mass lower limits including those from lhc , ii ) the two neutral cp - even higgs boson masses @xmath51 and @xmath80 to be within the ranges of eq.[lep - lhc - masslimits ] , iii ) the lep specified limits for @xmath41-boson to be non - standard model like as in eq.[lepcriterion ] and iv ) the chosen value @xmath161 .",
    "besides the above , the parameter points also satisfy limits for @xmath95 as shown in eq.[bsgammalimits ] and the lhcb limits of @xmath94 of eq.[bsmumulimit ] .",
    "we have also verified the validity of the range of @xmath150 as mentioned in the last section .",
    "the scattered points that satisfy the above limits are shown with diamond label ( in blue ) .",
    "the red circles ( enclosing diamonds ) additionally show the points that satisfy the dm relic density constraint .",
    "in this analysis we consider the possibility of lsp to be also a sub - dominant candidate of dark matter .",
    "thus consistency with the cdm relic density constraint here means satisfying only the upper limit of eq.[planckdata ] .",
    "there is a general absence of valid points in the region of @xmath162  gev .",
    "we will come back to this point in the discussion of fig.[ma - tanbeta - constraints ] .",
    "the recent results of decay of heavy neutral higgs bosons @xmath163 to @xmath82 pairs from cms@xcite and atlas@xcite keep only the small @xmath47 zone to be allowed for small @xmath46 region ( @xmath164  gev ) . because of the above data there is no allowed zone for @xmath165 for @xmath166  gev as shown by the black solid line of fig.[ma - tanbeta ] .",
    "the dashed line , on the other hand , shows the indirect effect of @xmath87@xcite constraint from atlas when translated into the @xmath160 plane by using the tree level relationship between the masses of pseudoscalar and charged higgs bosons in mssm , namely @xmath167 .",
    "the latter constraint eliminates @xmath46 below 120  gev .",
    "the regions marked by i , ii , iii and iv are thus discarded via @xmath168 and @xmath87 data .",
    "hence , the surviving @xmath46 range for @xmath169 , as shown in fig.[ma - tanbeta ] is given by , @xmath170        we now discuss the details of the interplay of the most important constraints of our analysis in the illh scenario of mssm in the @xmath160 plane in regard to the blanck intermediate zone @xmath162  gev as mentioned above .",
    "the lightest ( cyan ) scattered points of fig.[ma - tanbeta - constraints ] correspond to parameter points that at least satisfy the two higgs mass constraints of eq.[lep - lhc - masslimits ] .",
    "the points in general span the @xmath160 plane , albeit with varying degree of existence for different zones . imposing the lep higgs information regarding @xmath72 from eq.[lepcriterion ] ( shown as darker ( red ) circles )",
    "drastically reduces the available parameter space in the aforesaid intermediate zone of @xmath46 .",
    "further reduction of parameter points in the same region occurs via the constraint of @xmath94 from eq.[bsmumulimit ] .",
    "the star ( maroon ) shaped points refer to parameter points in @xmath160 plane that satisfy eq.[bsmumulimit ] in addition to eqs.[lep - lhc - masslimits ] and [ lepcriterion ] .",
    "thus the above step - by - step imposition of various constraints shows that requirement of @xmath41-boson to be non - sm like via eq.[lepcriterion ] and the stringent limits from @xmath94 ( eq.[bsmumulimit ] ) in combination cause the absence of valid points in the intermediate @xmath46 zone ( fig.[ma - tanbeta ] ) .",
    "+ fig.[mch - tanbeta ] shows a scatter plot in @xmath171 plane from same analysis .",

    "the indirect effect of @xmath168 as seen in fig.[ma - tanbeta ] is additionally drawn as a dashed ( maroon ) line by using the tree level relationship between @xmath46 and @xmath172 .",
    "the region of @xmath173  gev becomes entirely disallowed via @xmath87 from atlas .",
    "the combined disallowed zones are shown as regions i to iv .",
    "the valid zone of charged higgs mass is seen to be @xmath174  gev that falls below the line corresponding to @xmath168 data from cms@xcite .",
    "we now consider studying the parameters connected to the higgs mass radiative correction , that becomes highly relevant for the illh scenario .",
    "as discussed before , important corrections come from the top - stop as well as bottom - sbottom loops .",
    "the latter loops become important because of large range of values of @xmath105 considered in this analysis ( eq.[parameterranges ] ) .",
    "we will also see that effect of considering large @xmath105 has an important consequence on the constraints of @xmath95 .",
    "+ fig.[ma - at - forconstraints ] shows scattered points in the @xmath175 plane .",
    "all the lightest ( cyan ) points satisfy at least the higgs mass limits of eq.[lep - lhc - masslimits ] .",
    "these points include both positive as well as negative values of @xmath104 .",
    "we see that there are parameter points satisfying just the two higgs mass limits for negative values of @xmath104 when @xmath46 spans approximately up to 130 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "only positive solutions of @xmath104 are available that satisfy the two constraints for @xmath176 and @xmath177 for larger values of @xmath46 that are consistent with eq.[survivingma ] .",
    "further imposition of the lep higgs information regarding @xmath72 from eq.[lepcriterion ] results into darker ( red ) circles which are also understood to coexist with star ( maroon ) marked points that additionally obey the constraints of @xmath95 and @xmath94 ( eqs.[bsgammalimits ] and [ bsmumulimit ] ) .",
    "fig.[ma - mu - forconstraints ] shows the effect in @xmath178 plane while constraints are imposed step - by - step as in fig.[ma - at - forconstraints ] with the symbols having the same meaning .",
    "clearly , satisfying the two higgs limits is possible both for small and large values of @xmath105 .",
    "however like fig.[ma - at - forconstraints ] constraints from @xmath95 and @xmath94 discard a large region of parameter space . for the surviving zone of eq.[survivingma ] the above selects a zone with relatively small values of @xmath105 ( up to 6  tev ) ( fig.[ma - mu - forconstraints ] ) as valid parameter range .",
    "investigation reveals that it is indeed the limits from @xmath95 that disallow a large region of parameter space and we try to explain this in a brief _ qualitative _ detail by dividing the span of @xmath46 into two distinct zones * ( i ) below * and * ( ii ) above * 130 gev for both the subfigures of fig.[at - mu - forconstraints ] .",
    "the above is same as dividing into smaller and relatively larger @xmath172 zones .",
    "we remind that @xmath130 loop contributes to @xmath95 with the same sign as that of @xmath129 loop of sm@xcite .",
    "+   + focusing on the smaller half side of @xmath46 ( i.e. below 130 gev ) of fig.[ma - at - forconstraints ] , analysis revealed that @xmath95 typically becomes larger than the upper limit of eq.[bsgammalimits ] when @xmath179 ( but there are some cases where the value goes below the lower bound too in our multi - dimensional parameter space of mssm , as we will see below ) .",
    "it turns out that the same smaller @xmath46 region of fig.[ma - mu - forconstraints ] ( i.e. the lower half side ) that is also associated with negative values of @xmath104 and for which @xmath95 exceeds the allowed limit typically corresponds to smaller values of @xmath105 . thus combining the results of the two subfigures of fig.[at - mu - forconstraints ]",
    "we find that for most of the parameter zones corresponding to the lower half of @xmath46 and negative @xmath104 , the values of @xmath180 are relatively small since both the components namely @xmath105 and @xmath181 are individually on the smaller side .",
    "thus in spite of having @xmath182 , an apparently favorable situation for cancellation of diagrams in @xmath95 analysis , the chargino - stop loop contribution is not sufficient to overcome the large charged higgs contribution which is typically larger in the smaller @xmath46 zone than what it would be for the larger @xmath46 zone as described above .",
    "thus @xmath95 limit is violated in its upper bound .",
    "+   + as mentioned before , in the low @xmath46 zone , additionally there are small regions of parameter space with negative @xmath104 where @xmath95 may become lesser than the lower limit of eq.[bsgammalimits ] in the region of a sufficiently large @xmath105 . thus chargino contribution may significantly neutralize the charged higgs contribution but as mentioned in section-[mssmdesc ] there may be an important gluino - squark loop contribution which comes with an opposite sign wrt the charged higgs contribution . the latter contribution which goes in tandem with the negative contribution from the chargino loop ( while @xmath179 ) causes @xmath95 to go below the lower limit of eq.[bsgammalimits ] .",
    "+   + here the chargino and the charged higgs loop contributions add up but the gluino contribution which is important for large @xmath105 and/or large @xmath183 has an opposite sign .",
    "even with varying stop , chargino and gluino masses , parameter points with very large and positive values of @xmath104 typically have exceedingly large values of @xmath95 unless @xmath105 becomes sufficiently large to cause a large degree of cancellation via the gluino loop .",
    "such cancellations are indeed indicated in both the panels of fig.[at - mu - forconstraints ] for the low @xmath46 zone when the cluster of star marked points span from @xmath184  tev whereas @xmath105 varies from 6 to 12 tev satisfying both the limits of @xmath95 of eq.[bsgammalimits ] .",
    "+ here the parameter points that satisfy the two higgs mass limits are such that @xmath104 is essentially always positive ( except an insignificant number of parameter points ) .",
    "the charged higgs mass goes higher , hence its contribution is relatively small .",
    "although @xmath104 is in the larger side , @xmath105 is relatively in the moderate zone .",
    "thus the combined chargino plus charged higgs contribution which have the same signs is not exceedingly large and is balanced by the gluino contribution which comes with a negative sign . thus in this zone of @xmath46 , @xmath95 constraint is likely to be satisfied a fact which is consistent with the figures .",
    "it is also quite likely to have adjacent parameter points that would fall below or above the limits of @xmath95 of eq.[bsgammalimits ] in this zone of @xmath46",
    ".     + finally , fig.[ma_mu_actual ] shows the possible values of the higgsino mixing parameter @xmath105 in @xmath178 plane when all the constraints ( eqs.[lep - lhc - masslimits ] to [ planckdata ] ) are imposed . for the valid @xmath46 zone of eq.[survivingma ]",
    "most of the scattered points correspond to values of @xmath105 between 3.5  tev to 6  tev .",
    "fig.[ma_vs_mstop_actual ] shows the spread of the lighter top - squark mass in @xmath185 plane . for the valid @xmath46 zone satisfying eq.[survivingma ]",
    "we find the value of lighter top - squark mass to spread within @xmath186 , a significant part of the range may indeed be probed in the lhc .",
    "now we compute few higgs decay ratios of interest in our analysis .",
    "the latest results as announced in moriond conferences in la thuile ( march 2013 ) may be seen in table  [ higgsdecaytabledata]@xcite .    .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us survey the discovery potential of another production mode : the associated production of the 98 gev higgs with top quarks when the higgs decays to a pair of bottom quark ( @xmath187 , @xmath188 ) .",
    "the production cross - section in this channel for a @xmath38 100 gev standard model higgs is @xmath38 1 pb at the 14 tev run of lhc@xcite . in a boosted regime , the decay products of both the top quarks and the higgs would be highly collimated and jet substructure algorithm can be a very useful tool to tag top quarks and higgs . instead of reconstructing the individual top decay products , in _ top tagging _ which is a technique to identify boosted hadronic top quarks , one uses a jet algorithm and performs a subjet analysis to reconstruct the top quark mass .",
    "we would like to remind our readers that production cross section of this channel is highly parameter space dependent . performing a random scan of the mssm parameter space",
    ", we obtain @xmath189 to be within 20 to 60% where @xmath41 refers to the 98  gev higgs boson of mssm .",
    "however , with a conservative standpoint we choose @xmath190 .",
    "we do not perform any detailed analysis in this mode . here",
    "we refer the results of an analysis already performed in this direction for a @xmath38 115 gev standard model higgs boson at 14 tev lhc @xcite .",
    "while translating the results of ref.@xcite for our choice of higgs mass , we expect an enhancement of @xmath191 and @xmath192 in the higgs production rate and the background estimation respectively .",
    "both these enhancements simply come from the difference in the choice of higgs boson mass considered in ref.@xcite and ours .",
    "hence , in our analysis we scale the signal and background by 1.6 and 1.2 respectively for a 98 gev higgs boson decaying to a pair of bottom quarks .",
    "it turns out that for an integrated luminosity of 300 @xmath6 and a 98 gev higgs boson , with two tagged b - jets the statistical significance of this channel is @xmath38 3.1@xmath7 . on the other hand , for a three b - tag sample",
    "the significance is @xmath38 2.6@xmath7 .",
    "again , we remind that the systematic uncertainty has not been taken into account .    apart from these direct production mechanisms , the 98 gev higgs boson may be produced from the cascade decay of susy particles . from our scan of mssm and semi - constrained nmssm it comes out that squarks / gluinos are sufficiently heavy leading to very small strong production cross section .",
    "however , in a more general framework squark / gluinos can be light , just above the lhc specified limits . in that case , the decay of gauginos can produce highly boosted higgs bosons which may be probed using the jet substructure technique ( for details see@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "besides , a 98 gev higgs production from the decay of heavy higgses may play an important role at the lhc@xcite .",
    "the proposed @xmath8 international linear collider ( ilc ) is an ideal machine to study this illh scenario due to its clean environment and relatively less background contamination .",
    "the possibility to verify this illh scenario in the context of nmssm in the linear colliders have already been discussed in ref.@xcite . here , the authors studied all the possible production / decay modes of nmssm higgs bosons in the context of linear collider , photon collider as well as muon collider . however , our goal is to probe this scenario in a model independent way .",
    "here we consider ilc with @xmath193= 250 gev and integrated luminosity = 100 @xmath6 .",
    "the golden channel for the higgs production in the context of ilc is @xmath194 , where , @xmath24 can decay both leptonically or hadronically .",
    "the final state would involve jets and/or leptons depending upon the decay of the @xmath24-boson while we assume higgs always decays into a pair of bottom quark .",
    "we use madgraph5@xcite to estimate the cross - section for both the signal and the sm background for @xmath195 luminosity .",
    "the production cross - section of a 98 gev standard model higgs boson at the ilc with 250 gev center of mass energy is about 350 @xmath196 .",
    "the most dominant background comes from the @xmath24-pair production which is about 1.1 pb . in order to satisfy the lep bounds , we assume a @xmath197 lep excess for the 98 gev higgs boson .",
    "we further assume @xmath198 @xmath122-tagging efficiency while calculating the statistical significance @xmath199 .",
    "we find that a 98 gev higgs boson can be easily discovered / excluded at the 250  gev ilc with a 100 @xmath6 luminosity which is easily achievable within the first few years of its run .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the possibility that both the lep excess in @xmath200 final state with a 98 gev higgs boson and the lhc di - photon signal for a 125 gev higgs - like object can be simultaneously explained in the general mssm framework .",
    "it turned out that the mssm parameter space where such scenario is valid is also consistent with several low energy constraints obtained from the heavy flavour sector , the cold dark matter constraints obtained from the recent planck collaboration , limits from xenon100 experiment on the dark matter direct detection cross - section . in our mssm higgs parameter space scan we have also implemented the recent results on the heavy mssm higgs boson search via @xmath201 mode from cms and atlas collaboration and the search of charged higgs boson from atlas via @xmath202 mode .",
    "after all these constraints , we have finally obtained the following allowed ranges of @xmath46 and @xmath203 : @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "we have also shown that for the above ranges of @xmath46 and @xmath172 , @xmath47 is confined in a very narrow window @xmath206 from the higgs searches at the lep and the lhc .",
    "we have also pointed out that parameters related to radiative corrections to the higgs spectrum have significant impact on our whole analysis .",
    "additionally , @xmath128 limits discard a large region of parameter space and this we tried to explain in a reasonable detail .",
    "particularly , this causes @xmath207 to vary between @xmath208  tev for all the allowed points .",
    "we have also studied the correlation between different decay modes @xmath209 of the heavy higgs boson of mssm ( @xmath210 gev ) and our results showed that these rates are consistent within @xmath211 of the latest data on the higgs signal from 7 tev and 8 tev lhc run . moreover , we have also discussed briefly the prospect of the illh scenario in the context of nmssm . indirect exclusion of a 98 gev higgs boson in nmssm is possible though it depends on the choice of the model parameters and the particle spectrum .",
    "we studied the possibility of observing the 98 gev higgs boson at the 14 tev run of lhc .",
    "we focused on the 98 gev higgs production via higgs - strahlung : @xmath212 , followed by @xmath213 decay . because of the large @xmath214 of such higgs boson at the 14 tev lhc",
    ", the decay products of the higgs boson will form a highly collimated jet and we performed our analysis using the technique of jet substructure .",
    "our analysis showed that the statistical significance for observing the above higgs boson signal at the 14 tev lhc run with 300 @xmath215 luminosity is at most @xmath216 .",
    "moreover , when the higgs boson is produced in association with top quarks one can achieve a 3.1@xmath7 ( 2.6@xmath7 ) level of statistical significance with two ( three ) tagged @xmath122-jets . here",
    ", we would like to stress that throughout the analysis we have not taken into account the systematic uncertainties in the sm background estimation which certainly would modify the signal significance .",
    "we hope that the experimental collaborations would perform more dedicated analysis in this direction using the real data of the 14 tev run of lhc .",
    "we have also attempted to explore the prospect of ilc to probe illh higgs scenario . even with a very conservative estimate",
    ", ilc would have a much better sensitivity to exclude or discover the 98 gev higgs boson within a few years of its run .",
