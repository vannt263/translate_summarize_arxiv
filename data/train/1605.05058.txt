    "recent remarkable developments in information systems require higher density magnetic storage devices .",
    "however , research and development in this field has faced a serious problem regarding information instability . according to numerous studies ,",
    "memory bits need to satisfy the thermal stability condition given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the uniaxial ( or first - order ) anisotropy constant , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the volume of bit and the temperature , respectively .",
    "thus , the realization of high density memory by decreasing @xmath6 is accompanied by instability of this condition .    despite this serious issue in the finite - temperature nature of the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae )",
    ", few studies were conducted for 3d transition - metal systems before the precise studies of okamoto et al.@xcite and thiele@xcite et al . in 2002",
    ", these studies experimentally demonstrated that the uniaxial mae of epitaxial fept films exhibit the relation of @xmath8 in the low - temperature region .",
    "they additionally showed that the callen ",
    "callen low@xcite @xmath9 relation is missing . shortly thereafter",
    ", skomski et al.@xcite theoretically showed @xmath10 dependence in l10-type copt with a classical mean - field two - sublattice model .",
    "similarly , mryasov et al.@xcite demonstrated that the @xmath8 relation can be reproduced from the effective two - ion anisotropy term or from anisotropic exchange interactions between fe spins mediated by induced pt spins .",
    "mryasov et al.@xcite considered the following model hamiltonian : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the fe and pt spins at the @xmath14th and @xmath15th site in each sublattice , respectively .",
    "the first term represents the exchange interaction between fe spins , and the second and third terms are the single - ion anisotropy terms of fe and pt spins , respectively .",
    "the key feature in this model is that the pt spin moment @xmath13 is induced through the exchange field @xmath16 from the surrounding fe spins .",
    "thus , the third term can be rewritten in the form @xmath17 by using the relation @xmath18 . here",
    ", @xmath19 implies the spin susceptibility of pt , and @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "this term corresponds to the two - ion anisotropy energy consisting of two different fe spins . in this sense , the resultant form of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : saisho ] ) becomes a generalized anisotropic exchange hamiltonian , which is usually known as the xxz spin model .",
    "based on this scheme , the @xmath8 relation could be successfully realized for the fept system using the langevin dynamics simulation.@xcite in 2006 , staunton et al.@xcite attempted a first - principles calculation for the mae of fepd at a finite temperature .",
    "staunton et al . also demonstrated the relation @xmath10 and proposed that the anisotropic exchange interaction is responsible for the @xmath10 relation .    according to the above theories ,",
    "an effective two - ion anisotropy term is realized in the two - sublattice systems : one sub - lattice has a strong ferromagnetic character and the other sub - lattice has a large spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) . in the present work , to confirm the above scenario , we calculate the mae as a function of @xmath0 for the tetragonally distorted ( @xmath22 ) feco disordered alloy@xcite , which was theoretically proposed by burkert et al.@xcite to have large mae .",
    "the feco disordered alloy is not a two - sublattice system , and it is completely different from the fept system . for reference , we also calculated mae of fept , copt , and mnal l10-type ordered alloys .",
    "we selected mnal because al does not have strong soi like pt . furthermore ,",
    "as suggested by kota et al.,@xcite the mechanisms of mae occurrence for these systems differs . in this sense , the mnal and feco alloys are adequate systems for investigating whether the model proposed by mryasov et al .",
    "is feasible .",
    "consequently , we observed that these systems exhibit @xmath1 relation with the exponent @xmath23 approximately 2 . from these results",
    ", we expect that the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) relation is a general feature in ferromagnetic metals .",
    "a standard method for performing practical calculations of the finite - temperature magnetism of itinerant electron systems is to adopt the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) in terms of the thermally fluctuated spins as scattering potentials for electrons.@xcite to obtain the mae , the soi is further required in the hamiltonian , as demonstrated by staunton et al.@xcite although the inclusion of soi requires considerable computer resources and time , this approach is unavoidable for realizing the direct dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath5 on temperature .",
    "however , by concentrating only on the relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , this expensive approach can be avoided by employing the disordered local moment ( dlm ) picture as follows .",
    "first , we assume a certain spin configuration @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is a unit vector at the @xmath14th site ) in real space so that the average direction points to @xmath28 ( unit vector ) . by artifically arranging the configuration @xmath26 to vary the summation @xmath29 from 1 to 0",
    ", we can realize the states between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( curie temperature ) .",
    "next , under this configuration ( @xmath32 ) as a molecular field distribution , we calculate the electronic total energy and magnetization defined by @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath23 component of the magnetization ) , respectively . from the relation between ( @xmath35 and @xmath34",
    ", we get @xmath25 versus @xmath24 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 imply the directions of the a- and c - axis , respectively . to further reduce computational resources , we assume that the direction @xmath27 is restricted to be parallel or antiparallel to @xmath28 , which means that the spin configuration is always collinear in the line parallel to @xmath28",
    ". this strongly influences the temperature dependence of @xmath0 and then @xmath5 .",
    "however , we believe that this assumption does not seriously affect the relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath0 .    to confirm this model , we calculated the case for fept and compared our results with those obtained by mryasov et al.@xcite and staunton et al.@xcite we adopt cpa for the random arrangement of spins @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the models we considered here are given as @xmath39 for fept ( see fig . 1 ) and @xmath40 for feco alloy with @xmath41 , and so on . here , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) describes an fe atom whose moment points in the @xmath28 ( @xmath44 ) direction .",
    "therefore , @xmath45 implies a completely ferromagnetic state at @xmath30 , and @xmath46 implies a non - magnetic state at @xmath47 . for each @xmath48 and @xmath28",
    ", we calculate both @xmath49 and @xmath50 by means of the cpa .",
    "the systems we considered here are fept , copt , mnal , and feco alloys which have large @xmath5 values . for the electronic structure calculations",
    ", we employed the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) method@xcite including the soi under the local density functional approximation . for the disordered feco alloy",
    ", we applied another cpa for the random configuration of the fe and co atoms in the bct - lattice .",
    "in fig . 2 , we show the calculated total magnetic moments @xmath0 per unit cell of each alloy as a function of @xmath48 . in every alloy ,",
    "@xmath0 decreases linearly with increasing @xmath48 .",
    "this suggests that the magnetic moments in these alloys have similar properties to the local moment model described by the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , we confirmed that the amplitude of the local moment in these alloys remains constant in the whole range of @xmath48 .",
    "figure 3 shows the calculated values of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath48 .",
    "all @xmath5 values monotonically decrease with an increase of @xmath48 or a decrease of @xmath0 .",
    "this behavior is understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "generally , in magnetic systems , the magnetic easy direction and energy anisotropy originate from the connection of the orbital moments with the crystal axis .",
    "note that the orbital moments are induced by the spin moments through the soi , and the average orbital moment determines the anisotropy energy rather than the local orbital moment .",
    "therefore , when the spin moments fluctuate spatially , the average orbital moment decreases , resulting in a decrease of the anisotropy energy .",
    "as we will show in a separate paper , @xmath5 is expressed by the spatial correlation function of orbital moments , which implies that @xmath5 is determined by the expectation value of the orbital moment corresponding to the average orbital moment .    in fig .",
    "3 , we note that the @xmath5 values remain finite at @xmath46 corresponding to the curie temperature .",
    "this behavior is due to the assumption that restricts the spin moments to be aligned collinearly , from which there remains an energy difference between the cases for @xmath51 and @xmath52 even at @xmath46 .",
    "this result is incorrect because , at @xmath31 , the spin configuration is completely random , yet the spin configuration is the same for these two cases .",
    "thus , we consider that the mae possesses a certain constant value in addition to the @xmath53 term .    by comparing fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , @xmath5 decreases more rapidly than @xmath0 with increasing temperature , if @xmath48 is regarded as temperature .",
    "this implies that the exponent @xmath54 of @xmath53 is larger than unity . actually , the curves of @xmath5 versus @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "4 clearly exhibit @xmath54 value larger than unity . to determine the exponent , we generate log - log plots as shown in fig .",
    "the exponents clearly remain around the value of 2 .",
    "we should emphasize that the exponent for fept is @xmath55 , which is almost the same as that given by experiments and theories .",
    "apart from the constant value , the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath0 can be well reproduced by the present approach based on several assumptions .",
    "in addition , the cases for the mnal alloy and bct - feco disordered alloy also exhibit an exponent of approximately 2 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , these systems are different from the model proposed by mryasov et al .",
    "to introduce the two - ion anisotropy term in the heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "this leads us to believe that the relation @xmath56 ( @xmath2 ) is a general relationship in itinerant electron systems . even though the amplitude of local moments remains constant in the whole range of @xmath48 ( temperature ) as shown in fig .",
    "2 , this is apparently different from the case for localized spin systems where the exponent is around 3.@xcite as mentioned previously , this difference comes from the difference in the mechanisms : @xmath5 of a metallic system is determined through the spatial correlation function of orbital moments while that of a localized spin system is expressed by the single - ion anisotropy energy .",
    "in the disordered local moment picture , we calculated the magnetization and magnetic anisotropy energy of fept , copt , and mnal ordered alloys and the bct - feco disordered alloy using a first - principles approach combined with cpa . here , we assumed spatially fluctuated spin configurations as a thermal effect at finite temperatures .",
    "all alloys exhibit a relation @xmath1 with the exponent @xmath57 .",
    "this is consistent with the two - ion anisotropy model , in contrast to the case for the single - ion anisotropy model exhibiting @xmath3 .",
    "from the fact that these systems have different mechanisms of mae , we suggest that the relation @xmath56 ( @xmath2 ) is general and robust in itinerant electron systems .    20    s. okamoto , n. kikuchi , o. kitakami , t. miyazaki , y. shimada , and k. fukamichi , phys . rev .",
