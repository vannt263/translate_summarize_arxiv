    "our experiments were carried out using a custom - fabricated swarm of bristle - bots   ( bbots ) ( murphy 2009 , bobadilla _ et al_. 2011 ) , simple self - propelled automata with similarities both to natural mechanical ratchets ( kuli _ et al_. 2009 ) and their artificial analogs ( mahadevan _ et al_. 2004 ) .",
    "our system has three controllable features : ( i ) a tunable ratio of linear speed and rate of turning for individual agents ; ( ii ) a collective ability to exert aligning forces and torques on each other by means of shape dependent contact interactions ; ( iii ) confinement induced by soft or hard boundaries .",
    "the design of our bbots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : design ] ) is optimized to be small , light , stable and modular . an elliptical plastic chassis ( major axis 7.92 cm , minor axis 1.85 cm ) serves as a container for a 1.2v varta rechargeable battery which can slide inside the chassis to adjust the position of the center of mass and thus change the relative ratio of translational and rotational speed .",
    "the battery is connected to a motor ( commonly used in cell phones ) housed on the top side of the chassis , with a mass of 0.5 g and an eccentricity of 0.8 mm , designed to rotate at 150 rounds per second .",
    "two rows of nylon bristles , obtained from a commercial toothbrush , form the legs of our bbots .",
    "the bristles are cut to 5 mm length to prevent tipping without compromising their flexibility and are attached to the chassis via a removable wedge .",
    "this allows us to control the inclination of the bristles relative to the chassis .",
    "the total mass of the object is 15.5 g.    principle of motion of a single bbot",
    ". the bristles act as legs that are periodically flexed under the action of the eccentric motor . over a cycle , the bending and unbending of",
    "the tilted bristles causes them to slip , resulting in forward motion.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    performance of a bbot , i.e. its velocity when confined to a channel , as a function of ( a ) motor frequency , ( b ) total mass , ( c ) bristle length and ( c ) inclination with respect to the vertical.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    bbots move when the eccentrically loaded motor drives the legs of the machine , the bristles , which flex periodically .",
    "the bending of the tilted bristles on the substrate causes them to move more easily in the forward direction relative to the rear , leading to a rectification of the periodic driving and thus directed movement . over each period of rotation of the eccentric motor",
    "the sequence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : locomotion ] is followed ( see also [ sec : appendix - a ] and supplementary movie 1 ) : 1 ) the bristles are loaded by a force @xmath0 ( @xmath1 weight of the bbot , @xmath2 eccentric mass , @xmath3 lever arm , @xmath4 angular frequency of the motor ) ; 2 ) as the eccentric mass rotates , the load on the bristles decreases , causing the bristles to recoil ; 3 ) the bristles slip forward on the underlying substrate , producing a net displacement of the object . to quantify the motion of an individual bbot",
    ", we analyzed the shape of a row of bristles treated as a single elastic beam subject to a periodic tip load as well as a frictional force in the horizontal direction ( see [ sec : appendix - a ] ) and showed how the linear velocity of a bbot and its turning rate depend on the design parameters of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : single - bot ] , we show how the motor speed , bristle position , length and angle and the system mass leads to changes in the speed of an individual bbot confined to a narrow channel to prevent lateral drift . we see that the bristle inclination and length have a strong effect on bbot locomotion ; increasing the angle @xmath5 of the bristle with respect to the vertical direction causes the bbots to slow down substantially when @xmath5 is varied from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the length of the bristles affects the motion of a bbot in two ways : longer bristles cause the center of mass to be displaced further in each step , leading to a linear increase in the velocity ( fig .",
    "1c-3 ) , while short stiff bristles lead to a noisier dynamics associated with rebounds and jumps driven by the eccentric forcing . furthermore , because long bristles cause the bbots to spend a longer time in contact with the substrate ( where the transverse component of the eccentric force is balanced by friction ) , they move primarily along a straight line , while bbots equipped with short bristles are prone to move in a circle .",
    "this sensitive dependence on the bristle parameters allows us to tune the locomotion of individual subunits and study its role on the collective behavior of the community .",
    "in particular , by choosing 5 mm bristles and varying @xmath5 from @xmath8 ( upright bristles ) to @xmath9 , we obtained two distinct types of individuals : 1 ) spinners , which are bbots with @xmath10 and @xmath6 that tend to spin clockwise with an angular velocity of up to 30 rad / s while moving slowly ; 2 ) walkers , which are bbots with @xmath11 that move in a straight or weakly curved orbit ( supplementary movie 2 ) .",

    "( b-1 ) a spinner with @xmath12 and ( b-2 ) a walker with @xmath13 in a hard - boundary arena . for a soft boundary ,",
    "a consequence of the shallow bowl - shaped curvature is that the bbot is reflected toward the interior . for a hard boundary ,",
    "the bbot gets aligned with the edge of the arena and moves along it.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "in most prior studies of collective behavior , the boundary is not considered ; indeed theoretical studies routinely treat only the case with periodic boundaries , while the few experimental studies that exist aim to minimize the role of boundaries . in our study , the boundaries play a most important role as we now discuss .",
    "our arena consists of a circular plate of 44 cm in diameter , with a single bbot taking up approximatively 0.8% of the total available area .",
    "we first consider the interaction of a bbot with the boundary that causes it to be reflected back from the edge , into the middle , using an arena with a gentle upward sloping edge , fabricated by oven - forming an acrylic disc over a frisbee - shaped aluminum mold . here",
    ", we see that surface topography plays a role normally reserved for the boundary by influencing the motion of a bbot via environmental changes . with this _ soft boundary _ setup , our bbots either turn back into the middle ( behavior typical of spinners , i.e. @xmath14 ) or they oscillate back and forth in a periodic motion that causes them to remain in the neighborhood of a particular location at the boundary ( behavior typical of walkers , i.e. @xmath15 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory]a ) .",
    "this pendulum - like effect follows from the fact that the walker s path is never perfectly radial , so that as a bbot climbs the edge it also turns sideways . on the steepening gradient near the edge",
    ", the bbot typically slips backwards , as it rotates by about @xmath7 , and sisyphus - like , tries to climb up the edge again only to be kicked back to where it started .",
    "these oscillations may be repeated a few times for an individual bbot before it eventually moves back into the center of the arena , and then onto another part of the edge where the same phenomena is repeated .",
    "strong walkers with @xmath16 do not experience the oscillatory motion at the boundary because their forward propulsion dominates the role of sideways spinning motion and tends to align the bbots to be normal to the edge independent of how they initially approach the boundary .      to see what happens when we change the environment in which the bbots operate , we replaced the boundary of the arena with a gently curved edge with a flat circular disc of the same 44 cm diameter , bounded by a thick ( vertical ) strip of acetate @xmath17 cm high that is held firmly in place by a ring of thick translucent tubing .",
    "the most salient feature of this _ hard boundary _ system is that the boundaries are not reflective , so that a bbot that hits the edge will begin to circulate in a particular direction around the arena , traveling always parallel to the edge ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectory]b ) .",
    "we observe stable motion in both a clockwise and counterclockwise direction , the determining factor being the angle of initial contact with the wall .",

    "summarize the three behaviors observed in the experiments with bbots : ( a ) disordered ( random ) motion of spinners at low density ; ( b ) swirling motion of spinners at high density , and ( c ) stasis of walkers at high density .",

    "the resulting movies were processed with tracking software to compute the position , orientation and the translational and rotational velocity of each bbot and thus quantify their individual behavior .",
    "this allows us to calculate the following two order parameters to characterize the collective behavior of the putative swarm : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total number of bbots and @xmath22 the velocity of the @xmath23th bbot at time @xmath24 .",
    "we see that @xmath18 is the average velocity of the bbots , while @xmath19 is their average speed .",
    "when they move in a disordered fashion , @xmath25 ( becoming exact in the infinite particle limit ) and @xmath26 ; bbots moving coherently in space have both @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while if a cluster of bbots is dynamically arrested , @xmath29 .    in our experiments",
    "we used a paperboard template that initially arrested the motion of the bbots . when this was removed , the bbots moved and eventually reached a statistical steady state ( supplementary movie 3 ) .",
    "alternatively , we progressively increased the bbot population from 2 to 16 , adding a new one every 30 seconds and then removing them one at a time , to measure the hysteresis in the transition between states of collective behavior .    in fig .",

    "the order parameter @xmath18 increases and saturates once the swirling cluster is formed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : collective - behavior - ex]b-2 ) .",
    "walkers at low density have a different behavior than spinners ; they move to the edge , stay for a while before they turn around randomly , eventually reaching an approximately antipodal point where this behavior is repeated . as the number of walkers",
    "is increased , they form ephemeral clusters along the edge ( supplementary movie 4 ) that eventually break up . however ,",

    "phase diagram and hysteresis in collective behavior .",
    "( a ) a phase diagram summarizes the three types of collective behavior observed as a function of the number of bbots ( which is equivalent to their density ) and the bristle angle ( which is proportional to the inverse of the velocity ) confined to an arena with a soft boundary .",

    "newly added bbots are eventually collected by the swirling cluster . when bbots are withdrawn from the trailing edge of the swirling cluster the behavior switches from coordinated to disordered only when the population is below 6 bbots.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    to understand how confinement and topography lead to these behaviors , we first use bbots with an intermediate bristle inclination to observe the assembly and disassembly of clusters at a soft boundary ; for example , bbots with @xmath39 resist the sideways motion necessary for swirling but they do not get trapped at the edge as easily as bbots with larger @xmath5 .",
    "the result is that clusters can form orthogonal to the circular boundary , but if the cluster is too small in number it will eventually disassemble due to the growth of coordinated oscillations of the entire cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster]a ) .",
    "indeed clusters of four or five bots remain stable for over a minute before disassembling .",
    "the stasis or jamming region in our phase diagram describes the formation of clusters at even higher densities when they become stable over very long times .",
    "in contrast , collective behavior in the presence of a hard - boundary leads to contact with the vertical wall and aligns the bbots along the boundary thus limiting their motion and reducing the interactions between bbots ( fig . [",
    "fig : trajectory]b ) .",
    "bbots sliding along the boundary of the arena eventually form groups due to the small variations in the velocity of individuals .",
    "however , as the number of bbots in a group increases , it becomes less stable and can abruptly self - arrest .",

    "this force between the @xmath47-th particles and its @xmath46 neighbors is given by @xmath48 with @xmath49 a virtual _ spring length _",

    "the magnitude of the force is controlled by the spring - length @xmath49 obtained by intersecting the line @xmath50 with the perimeter of the region where the two ellipses overlap ( shaded in the figure ) .",

    "when a particle is in proximity of the boundary [ i.e. @xmath67 , this boundary torque has the effect of rotating the particle toward the interior .",
    "the non - locality of the boundary torque @xmath68 in mimics the distributed gravitational torque produced by the curvature of the dish in which the particles move and appears to have a significant role for the clustering of the particles at the boundary . compared with its local - analog ( i.e. a torque of the same form that acts only when @xmath69 ) , the torque has the effect of producing more densely packed clusters of particles along the boundary and thus fundamentally changes the collective behavior of the bbots .",
    "being curved , the boundary of the arena has the effect of getting the particles to form densely packed clusters .",
    "extending the range of the particle - boundary interaction is equivalent to increasing the curvature and thus accentuates the focusing effect .",
    "this is also the simplest situation where we see how the physical environment can control the behavior of these autonomous agents .",
    "our system differs fundamentally from those studied in the past by accounting correctly for orientational effects using torque balance rather than an ad - hoc alignment term , while also exploring the role of non - local interactions using topography and finite size boundaries .",
    "the dynamical system is characterized by four dimensionless parameters : the scaled density @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the minor and major semi - axes of the ellipses ) , the spinning to walking ratio @xmath73 , the orienting parameter @xmath74 and the scaled noise parameter @xmath75 . in our experiments ,",

    "the primary interactions of these automata are with the boundary and so one sees random uncoordinated movements ( fig .",
    "[ fig : collective - behavior - th]a ) . at higher densities , as more ellipses simultaneously cluster in the same region of the boundary , the aligning force exerted on the ellipses by each other can overcome the action of the boundary provided the cluster is large enough .",
    "thus walkers for whom @xmath83 tend to aggregate into a static structure at the boundary at high enough density ( fig . [",
    "fig : collective - behavior - th]c ) .",
    "however , spinners for whom @xmath84 form clusters at the boundary that are tilted , and this broken symmetry together with the effect of the weak topography ( boundary curvature ) keeps them confined to the neighborhood of the boundary and causes the automata to eventually synchronize their velocities resulting in a collective swirling motion of the entire cluster ( fig .",

    "illustrates the origin of the three observed behaviors in a broader context .",
    "analogously to the simple self - propelled particles , bbots tend to migrate to the boundary , which depending on the local density of the bbots and their angular velocity , can either play the role of an obstacle that causes the objects to jam , or a confining channel that collects and aligns the bbots into a coordinated moving cluster . for a cluster of walkers at the boundary , each bbot in the cluster",

    "bbots that are spinners have a relatively small translational velocity and so are easily trapped by their neighbors at the boundary once their density is large enough and they unable to reverse direction and escape . however , the finite spinning torque leads to a global tilt of the bbots leading to a global swirling motion of the entire cluster along the edge of the arena .",

    "while the geometric structure of the clusters depends significantly on the shape of the particles , the occurrence of these three collective behaviors observed in the experiment is rather general . to demonstrate this we have run an additional set of simulations using self - propelled polar disks in place of elliptical particles ( see [ sec : appendix - b ] )",

    "analogously to the ellipses , the dynamics of the polar disks is also characterized by three regimes : random motion at low densities , jamming at the boundary for large densities when the angular velocity of the disks vanishes , and the formation of a compact cluster that circulates along the boundary for large densities when the disks have a finite angular velocity ( see [ sec : appendix - b ] ) .",
    "the similarity between our experimental system and the two models described above suggests that the coordinated circulation and jamming in a system of confined agents is generic .",
    "this form of collective behavior relies on simple but crucial features of the individual agents as well as the environment : the ability to translate and rotate , and the ability to interact with each other and with the environment , here including the boundary and the local topography .",
    "while the spatial structure of the clusters crucially depends on the shape and the packing properties of the particles , their collective motion is very robust , and depends on simple non - specific principles .    in living systems , where similar behaviors such as the density - driven transitions are seen in confined _ macrotermes michaelseni _ ( turner 2011 ) ,",

    "our study suggests that particle motion , shape and spatial interactions are sufficient and might in fact play equivalent roles . in a biological setting such as termite swarms , one might test these ideas by controlling the confinement of termites by varying the substrate curvature and slipperiness , gluing circular discs on their backs to make the interactions more isotropic , etc . in an artificial setting , the collective abilities of spinner and walker bbots to convert environmental interactions into dynamical behavior may allow us to explore functional swarms that can search and sense environments .",

    "<S> we show that when bristle - bots are confined to a limited arena with a soft boundary , increasing the density drives a transition from a disordered and uncoordinated motion to organized collective motion either as a swirling cluster or a collective dynamical stasis . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is regulated by a single parameter , the relative magnitude of spinning and walking in a single automaton . </S>",
    "<S> we explain this using quantitative experiments and simulations that emphasize the role of the agent shape , environment , and confinement via boundaries . </S>",

    "<S> theoretical attempts to understand these behaviors use putative models of interactions between organisms as a function of their density in periodic domains ( vicsek & zafeiris 2012 ) , while a practical approach circumvents the question of mechanism and implements workable strategies to actively direct the collective dynamics of ensembles of agents ( rubenstein _ et al_. 2011 , mellinger _ et al_. 2010 ) using feedback control in individual agents ( braitenberg 1984 ) . </S>",
