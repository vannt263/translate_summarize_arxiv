    "it is the low value of @xmath81  mev which points to a slight quantitative tension with our imagination of a hadronization temperature of @xmath82  mev ( or slightly above ) to apply the thermo - statistical model for hadrons with vacuum masses .",
    "given the simple structures of our anstze it seems not too surprising that the available parameter space is rapidly exhausted in accommodating such vastly different aspects as the thermodynamics of the strongly interacting medium and the fate of selected individual constituents thereof .",
