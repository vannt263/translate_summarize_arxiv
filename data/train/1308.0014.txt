    "the first color measurements of kbos found that they exhibited a surprising diversity of colors .",
    "if kbos were formed in situ , they would have nearly identical compositional properties and weathering histories because the region between 34 au and @xmath260 au is characterized by a single set of stable volatile materials @xcite .",
    "color measurements of kbos , however , show a range from very red ( @xmath3 ) to neutral or blueish ( @xmath4 ) , compared to a solar @xmath1 of 1.03 .",
    "there is little consensus on the origin of the kbo color heterogeneity .",
    "the effects of collisional processing and weathering on kbo colors have been considered .",
    "@xcite performed numerical simulations which incorporated a reddening component from irradiation and a collisional erosion process which exposed neutral material on the objects surfaces .",
    "this model successfully reproduces the range of colors observed in kbos , but also predicts objects with large photometric light curves due to surface color variations and partial resurfacing from impacts .",
    "this was later found to be inconsistent with the small magnitude variations for kbos , regardless of @xmath1 color @xcite .",
    "the model also does not predict the correlated colors of binary kbos @xcite .",
    "a balance of collisional resurfacing and weathering processes was found to be incompatible with the observed properties of kbos .",
    "space weathering may still have a measurable impact on the apparent colors of kbos .",
    "@xcite used a two component model of kbo composition and investigated the effects of weathering due to solar wind ions .",
    "their lab experiments showed that irradiation caused reddening in the carbon - bearing material , but further exposure resulted in a darkening and flattening of the spectra .",
    "their model incorporated a component with a flat spectrum and a silicate material with a carbon - bearing layer .",
    "the varying combination of these components with different amounts of irradiation reproduces the range of colors seen in the outer solar system .",
    "if the colors of kbos are a result of solar wind irradiation , the entire evolutionary history , as well as original composition , would affect the apparent color of kbos .",
    "different kbo colors may primarily reflect compositional variation during formation .",
    "@xcite argue that when objects form outside of approximately 20 au , methanol ice ( ch@xmath5o ) is stable and expected to be the most abundant component .",
    "the irradiation of this ice will result in a red object with a high albedo @xcite .",
    "inward of approximately 20 au , the surfaces of objects are composed of water ( h@xmath6o ) , carbon dioxide ( co@xmath6 ) , and small amounts of hydrogen sulfide ( h@xmath6s ) , creating a dark , neutral surface color when irradiated @xcite .",
    "transport of this assortment of kbos from their different source regions to their current locations in the kuiper belt may explain the distribution of neutral and red kbos observed .",
    "at least two scenarios of kbo color distribution have been proposed .",
    "@xcite found that the cold classical kbos ( ckbos ) were red while the hot ckbos were gray .",
    "hot and cold objects were differentiated using perihelion , @xmath7 , and inclination , @xmath8 , and they found two different unimodal color distributions .",
    "different color distributions for different dynamical classifications suggests that the hot and cold ckbos have different histories , perhaps different formation locations .",
    "a recent paper by @xcite performed a detailed statistical analysis of kbo colors based on @xmath0 magnitude , a proxy for size , searching for a correlation with @xmath1 color distributions .",
    "data were compiled from previous surveys , and 253 objects were included in the analysis .",
    "the colors of small objects ( @xmath9 6.8 ) were found to be well described by a bimodal distribution .",
    "the larger objects ( @xmath10 ) were also found to follow a bimodal distribution , but with slightly different peak values .",
    "the intermediate objects were found to be unimodal , covering the full range of @xmath1 values seen in the other @xmath0 ranges .",
    "if this @xmath0 magnitude dependency is true , new models will be required to understand the physical processes that create this effect . resolving the nature of the color diversity",
    "is a necessary step in understanding the global evolution of the kuiper belt .",
    "kbo discoveries and followup observations have had limited success because of the challenges presented by several observational biases .",
    "the discovery of kbos in a survey results in predicted observational arcs . depending on the prediction algorithm ,",
    "assumptions are made about the objects orbits , such as an energy constraint , a circular orbit , or the detection location ( perihelion or aphelion ) .",
    "these different assumptions have different recovery rates for different dynamical classes of object @xcite .",
    "the size of the recovery field also has a significant impact on the likelihood of successfully detecting the kbo during followup observations .",
    "these challenges are reflected in the minor planet center database , which often includes objects that were `` lost '' or have ambiguous orbital parameters .",
    "kbos with poorly predicted orbits may even have incorrect orbital classifications .",
    "it can require years of observations to constrain an orbit accurately enough to determine if an object is in a resonance @xcite .",
    "the discovery wavelength can also have an impact on the colors of discovered objects ; redder objects are easier to find in an @xmath11 band survey , but extremely red objects are difficult to measure in a range of photometric colors .",
    "the effect of these biases becomes more difficult to quantify when data are combined from multiple surveys .",
    "we investigated the @xmath1 color distributions of ckbos using two sample populations .",
    "we used a sample from the canada - france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a known discovery method , and a sample from the meudon multicolor survey ( 2ms ) photometric measurements @xcite , which has unknown selection effects .",
    "the kbos were classified into hot and cold populations in two different ways : based on their @xmath7 and semi - major axis , @xmath12 , as well as by an @xmath8 cut .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath7 cuts appear to provide a better division between the hot and cold ckbo populations in the cfeps l7 model @xcite .",
    "we created synthetic ckbo populations with color distributions based on object classifications and @xmath0 magnitudes and attempted to account for the biases introduced by photometric followup observations .",
    "the ckbo model populations were compared to the real ckbo samples using the anderson - darling ( ad ) statistical test .",
    "we find that an @xmath0 magnitude based color distribution is statistically rejected by the observations , but color distributions purely based on dynamical classification appear to be insufficient to describe the color distribution of ckbos .",
    "to distinguish between competing models for kbo color distributions , we compare published kbo color measurements with model based distributions .",
    "we consider two independent samples of kbo colors ; a sample derived from the cfeps l7 release @xcite , and one based on the 2ms data @xcite .",
    "the cfeps l7 sample was cross referenced with the mboss database of photometric kbo observations @xcite to determine the photometric properties of the sample . selecting only the classical cfeps l7 objects that have high - quality photometric measurements in the mboss database results in a sample of 8 objects , shown in figure [ cfeps_obj ] .",
    "the 2ms sample is a survey of photometric observations , and those values were used directly .",
    "the 2ms sample is considerably larger ( 21 objects ) , however the selection criterion of the data are unknown .",
    "the @xmath1 colors of the 2ms sample are shown in figure [ 2ms_obj ] .",
    "each of these kbo color sample populations is compared to a set of synthetic detections .",
    "two sets of criterion were used to classify the sample objects into hot and cold subpopulations .",
    "one classification scheme is based on their @xmath7 and @xmath12 values and the other is based on a cut in @xmath8 . for the @xmath7 criterion , ckbos with @xmath13 au are placed in the hot subpopulation and those with @xmath14 au and @xmath15 au in the cold . for the @xmath8 criterion ,",
    "hot ckbos have @xmath16 and cold ones have @xmath17 .",
    "a gap in the inclination cuts for this criterion minimizes possible contamination between the subpopulations .",

    "different synthetic kbo populations were created for the cfeps and 2ms observations .",
    "the synthetic objects were assigned colors based on color distribution models to create the @xmath0-model and the class - model .",
    "we also included the effect of photometric biases , resulting from observing the intrinsic population , into our synthetic detection models .",

    "the selection biases introduced in the 2ms discovery methods are not known . because the objects were not discovered in a systematic survey",
    ", the 2ms objects did not have a representative distribution of @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "the synthetic detections were created by resampling the actual objects from within their @xmath0 magnitude uncertainties .",
    "this generated a large model population for comparison , which could be assigned colors based on @xmath0 magnitude and orbital parameters representative of the 2ms data .",
    "the ckbos were selected from the synthetic populations , and classified into hot and cold objects .",
    "( resonant objects are highly sensitive to survey characteristics and are excluded from our analysis . ) different classification schemes for the cfeps and 2ms synthetic detection models were required because of the different methods used to create the models . for the cfeps synthetic objects , we used the known model classifications @xcite .",
    "the 2ms synthetic objects were classified in the same way as the 2ms data , based on their @xmath7 , @xmath12 , and @xmath8 values .",
    "these theoretical model populations provide a good match to the kuiper belt orbital distribution as sampled by the data and were used as our hot and cold comparison populations for modeling the various @xmath1 color distributions .",
    "the @xmath1 color distribution of the @xmath0-model depends on the @xmath0 magnitude of the objects , as described in @xcite .",
    "three different @xmath0 magnitude ranges were identified .",
    "@xcite determined that objects with @xmath19 and the objects with @xmath10 were bimodal , while the intermediate @xmath0 magnitude objects were found to be unimodal .",
    "the bimodal low and high @xmath0 magnitude populations also had different @xmath1 peak values defining their distribution .",
    "for the @xmath19 objects we used a bimodal @xmath1 color distribution with peaks at 1.2 and 1.8 , each represented by a gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.125 mag .",
    "the intermediate @xmath0 objects were modeled as a single broad distribution centered at @xmath1 of 1.6 with a standard deviation of 0.33 mag .",
    "the @xmath20 objects had peak @xmath1 values of 1.05 and 1.6 with standard deviations of 0.1 mag .",
    "@xmath1 colors were generated randomly from these distributions , and assigned to the synthetic objects in the model populations based on their @xmath0 magnitudes to create the @xmath0-model .",
    "the second @xmath1 color model assumes that the color distribution of the kbos is based on the objects dynamical classification .",
    "we used a color distribution with a red peak at @xmath1 of 1.55 with a standard deviation of 0.1 , and a blue peak at @xmath1 of 1.15 with a standard deviation of 0.12 mag .",
    "these parameters were selected to match the color distribution of 2ms objects in figure [ hist ] .",
    "the 2ms data have two peaks , however , the data in figures [ cfeps_obj ] and [ 2ms_obj ] suggest that the cold population lacks a blue component .",

    "panel 3 : the class - model with color measurement bias.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      in addition to a survey detection bias , the precision of the measured @xmath1 magnitudes will introduce an observational bias because of the brightness of the target objects .",
    "color surveys of kbos generally select objects that appear bright enough in @xmath11 band for photometry .",
    "however , for two equally bright objects in @xmath11 , redder objects have higher @xmath21 magnitudes , and are therefore more difficult to measure .",
    "the 2ms data were used to derive a relationship between larger magnitude uncertainties and increasing @xmath11 magnitude , and these model uncertainties were then applied to the class - model and @xmath0-model synthetic colors .",
    "a @xmath20.4 mag separation of the two color peaks in the model suggests that photometric precision is required to successfully detect the bimodality of the intrinsic population .",
    "the kbos with @xmath22 were considered un - measurable due to their large photometric uncertainty and removed from both of the color models .",
    "the remaining objects were assigned magnitude values within their error bars from the @xmath11 magnitude error model .",
    "these observable objects and colors with photometric error included were used to create new color models for both the @xmath0-model and class - model , and are referred to as the color measurement biased ( cmb ) models .",
    "once the photometric uncertainty cut is applied to the model , the new cmb models show a clear correlation between classification and @xmath0 magnitude , for both the @xmath0 and class -model samples .",
    "the different physical locations of the different classes of objects make larger-@xmath0 objects in some classes easier to detect than others .",
    "this is evident even in the 2ms data in figure [ 2ms_obj ] , where the larger-@xmath0 objects are all centaurs . in the models",
    ", the faintest objects predicted , with @xmath0 magnitudes greater than 7.5 , are almost entirely resonant objects . a mix of resonant and hot objects are found between @xmath0 magnitudes of 6.75 to 7.5 , and the detectable cold objects almost all have @xmath0 magnitudes below 6.75 .",
    "the observing biases caused by photometric detection limits and @xmath0 magnitude dependence make it more difficult to understand the nature of the underlying population .",
    "we used the ad test to compare the samples , as in cfeps @xcite .",
    "similar to the kolmogorov - smirnov test , the ad statistic computes the maximum distance between two distributions , however , the ad statistic ( @xmath23 ) is weighted . in order to determine the significance of the ad statistic value , a bootstrapping method was used .",
    "the significance of rejection of the null hypothesis , where the distributions are identical , was calculated by comparing the real object @xmath23 statistics with the input model @xmath23 statistics .    to mitigate the effect of precise sample values in our observational data , the ad @xmath23 value was calculated for photometric measurements consistent with the uncertainty associated with the data .",
    "for each object , the magnitude measurements were randomly assigned a value within their reported uncertainty range , and then the ad @xmath23 values was computed .",
    "this process was then repeated 1000 times .",
    "the mean and the standard deviation of the range of @xmath23 statistic values generated from the resampled data were compared to the @xmath23 statistic range found using the synthetic models .",
    "this gave the probability that the observations , with measurement uncertainties , could be from the synthetic color models .",

    "the results for the color models are given , with and without the addition of the cmb . both the @xmath0-model ( color distributions based on @xmath0 magnitude ) and the class - model ( colors based on object type ) were compared to the cfeps objects and the 2ms data , using both orbital subpopulation classification criteria .",
    "the @xmath1 distributions of hot and cold objects observed were compared separately against the model hot and cold objects .",
    "the use of @xmath7 or @xmath8 classification scheme is as indicated in tables [ adtest ] and [ adtestc ] .",

    "we have used two independent approaches to classification of ckbos into hot and cold subpopulations : a @xmath7 based selection criterion and an @xmath8 based criterion .",
    "these two approaches classify the majority of objects into the same subpopulations , with a few sources moving between categories .",
    "the @xmath7 criterion was chosen to reflect the orbit model generation process as described in the appendix of @xcite while the @xmath8 selection criterion is common in the literature .",
    "we also explored various @xmath8 cuts and boundaries , none of which resulted in a significant variation in our results .",

    "however , the 2ms data appears to reject the @xmath0-model , with and without the inclusion of the cmb .",
    "we also find that while the classification scheme does not change the overall rejection or acceptance of the models , the @xmath7 based classification sharpens the rejection of the @xmath0-model . a classification based model is not rejected for the hot objects , and , with the inclusion of the cmb , the class - model is an excellent match with the data .",

    "the cmb improves the acceptability of the class - model , however this model still does not provide a satisfying match to these data .",
    "the lack of goodness of fit of the unimodal distribution in the class - model is likely due to the four kbos with @xmath24  1.3 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the inclusion of the color measurement bias expands the expected color range to include half of these objects , but these four color measurements have acceptable photometric uncertainties , which suggests that the unimodal idea for the cold objects may require revision .",
    "the cold kbos have a steep size distribution , and bluer kbos have lower average albedos than red kbos .",
    "this could introduce an additional sampling bias , that would cause a bimodal population of small objects to appear primarily red .",
    "the difficulty in understanding the inherent cold object color distribution may be primarily a selection effect .",
    "the application of combined datasets of kbo colors to understand inherent relationships between different kbo properties is a complicated process .",
    "understanding the selection effects and biases introduced by different survey procedures is difficult , if not impossible , and assumptions about these effects can influence the apparent acceptability of color distribution models .",
    "the effects of kbo albedo may also result in an oversampling of red objects , and with the combination of these unknown effects we believe it is premature to claim conclusive trends in size - color relationships of kbos ."
