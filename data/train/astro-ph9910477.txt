    "almost all well - localized gamma - ray burst ( grb ) sources have shown afterglow emission in x - rays for several hours ( see piran 1999 for a review ) .",
    "often the emission persists on longer timescales at lower photon energies , peaking in the optical on a timescale of days and in the radio on a timescale of weeks or longer .",
    "this long - lasting afterglow emission is most naturally explained as synchrotron emission from a relativistic blast wave , produced by the grb explosion in an external medium ( see e.g. , paczyski & rhoads 1993 , katz 1994 , mszros & rees 1993 , 1997 , waxman 1997a , b ) .",
    "the emission frequency declines with time due to the deceleration of the shock wave ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) and the corresponding reduction in the characteristic electron energy and magnetic field amplitude behind the shock .",
    "the external medium could be either the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy ( waxman 1997a ) or a precurser wind from the grb progenitor ( chevalier & li 1999 ) .",
    "previous theoretical models of the afterglow emission have assumed for simplicity that the density profile of the external medium is smooth , i.e. uniform in the case of the ism or power - law with radius in the case of a progenitor wind . however , this simplifying assumption is not expected to hold in realistic situations .",
    "the ism is known to exhibit inhomogeneities due to turbulence , and stellar winds may vary in time and in solid angle . since the emitted afterglow flux depends on the instanteneous number of shocked electrons , any density inhomogenties are expected to induce temporal fluctuations in the afterglow lightcurve .",
    "observations of these fluctuations could provide additional constraints on the nature of the surrounding medium and the grb progenitor .    in this paper",
    "we derive the relation between the spatial power - spectrum of density fluctuations in the ambient medium surrounding the grb source and the fourier transform of temporal fluctuations in the afterglow flux .",
    "we focus on small - amplitude ( linear ) inhomogeneities , as those provide the minimal source of afterglow flux fluctuations .",
    " 2 presents the formalism used in our derivation , and  3 describes our numerical results .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in  4 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case where the unperturbed ambient medium is uniform , as for a background ism .",
    "the particle density inferred from detailed modeling of some grb afterglows is in the range @xmath3@xmath4 ( e.g. wijers & galama 1998 ; waxman 1997a , b ) , as expected for the ism of their host galaxies .",
    "the relativistic fireball produced by a grb explosion starts to decelerate at the radius where the energy of the ambient gas swept by the fireball is comparable to its energy output ( e.g. waxman 1997a , b ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hydrodynamic energy release in units of @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the duration of the grb in units of 10  s , and @xmath9 is the proton density of the ambient medium in units of @xmath10 . at larger radii",
    ", the shock follows the adiabatic self - similar evolution ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) whereby its lorentz factor declines with radius as @xmath11 and @xmath12    the global spectral characteristics of grb afterglows are naturally explained in terms of synchrotron emission by shock - accelerated electrons from this decelerating relativistic shock ( see e.g. , wijers , rees & mszros 1997 ; waxman 1997a , b ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the geometry of the emission from an infinitesimal volume element in spherical coordinates @xmath13 at a distance @xmath14 from the observer . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 along the line - of - sight .",
    "we define the emission coefficient @xmath17 to be the power emitted per unit frequency per unit volume per steradian in the rest frame of the outflowing material .",
    "we use prime to denote quantities in the local rest frame of the emitting material , while unprimed quantities are measured in the rest frame of the ism .",
    "note that @xmath18 is lorentz invariant ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) . for a spherically - symmetric expansion of material which emits isotropically in its local rest frame",
    ", we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the lorentz factor and the velocity of the emitting matter , respectively .",
    "a photon emitted at time @xmath23 and place @xmath24 in the ism frame will reach the detector at a time @xmath25 given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cosmological redshift of the grb and @xmath25 is chosen such that a photon emitted at the origin at @xmath28 will arrive at the detector at @xmath29 .",
    "thus we have ( granot , piran & sari 1999 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the luminosity distance to the grb , and @xmath32 are evaluated at the time @xmath23 implied by equation  ( [ eq : time ] ) .",
    "most of the shocked material is concentrated in a thin shell behind the shock front .",
    "the characteristic thickness of the shell is @xmath33 in the ism frame , where @xmath34 is the lorentz factor of the material just behind the shock . in the following",
    ", we will assume that the observed radiation originates from the thin shell of thickness @xmath35 behind the shock , inside of which the lorentz factor , the particle density , and the energy density of shocked ism obtain the following values , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number density of the unshocked ambient ism in its local rest frame , and @xmath38 is the proton mass .",
    "the actual value of @xmath39 depends not only on the hydrodynamics but also on the behaviour of the magnetic field and the shock - accelerated electrons which determine the local emissivity .    the volume integration expressed in equation  ( [ eq : flux ] )",
    "should be taken over the region occupied by the emitting shell at a given observed time , as illustrated in figure  2 .",
    "because of relativistic beaming , the observed radiation originates from a small angle along the line of sight , @xmath40 .",
    "hence , we can set the upper limit in the integration over @xmath41 to be @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the lorentz factor of the shell at point b on the plot .",
    "for a given observed time @xmath25 , the outer boundary @xmath44 of the integration region is defined by the relation ( granot et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "photons originating at this boundary are emitted from the front of the shell and arrive at the detector at the same time @xmath25 ( although they are emitted at different times ) .",
    "similarly , the inner boundary of the integration region is described by @xmath47 with @xmath48 , and where the associated photons are emitted from the back of the shell . note that although the emitting shell is thin , the region contributing to the observed flux at a given time is rather extended ; _ this has important consequences with respect to the spatial scale over which density fluctuations could affect the observed flux_. furthermore , consider a point @xmath49 inside the integration region .",
    "a photon emitted from this point at time @xmath50 will arrive at the detector at time @xmath25 .",
    "since the emitting shell is very thin , the point @xmath51 is very close to the shock front at time @xmath23 .",
    "thus the radius of the shock at time @xmath23 is approximately equal to @xmath52 .",
    "this fact will be used in our calculation .",
    "next , we derive the local emissivity due to synchrotron radiation .",
    "we assume that the energy densities of the shock - accelerated electrons and the magnetic field are fixed fractions of the internal energy density behind the shock front , @xmath53 , and that the shock produces a power law distribution of accelerated electrons with a number density per lorentz factor of @xmath54 for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 then the emissivity can be approximated as @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the synchrotron frequency of an electron with the minimal lorentz factor , and @xmath60 @xmath61 are constants .",
    "also note that the peak frequency at which the observed flux peaks is @xmath62 .",
    "subtituting equations  ( [ eq : power_2_left ] ) and ( [ eq : power_2_right ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : flux ] ) respectively , and making use of the fact that for a highly relativistic system , @xmath63 , and so @xmath64 we get the afterglow flux at a frequency @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath67 all emission frequencies under consideration are assumed to be below the cooling frequency , @xmath68 ( i.e. not affected by the rapid cooling of the high - energy tail of the electron distribution ) , and also well above the synchrotron self - absorption frequency , @xmath69 ( see sari et al .",
