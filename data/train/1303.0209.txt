    "_ in previous studies of nb the diffusion of a light interstitial particle such as a positive muon is possible.@xcite as a result a muon probes the magnetic field not at a specific site in the sample but the field is averaged over a diffusion trajectory . in order to study a possible effect of muon diffusion on tf @xmath0sr experiments presented in the main text",
    "we first determine the muon diffusion coefficient @xmath132 from zero field ( zf ) @xmath0sr experiment on the nb sample studied here .",
    "then we simulate the effect of muon diffusion on tf spectra using generalized bloch equations for a diffusing magnetic probe .",
    "muon hopping rate of @xmath133 mhz was determined at 2.5 k by grasselino _",
    "et al . _ from zf @xmath0sr experiments.@xcite in zero field the muon experiences a spin depolarization due to nuclear magnetic fields which for a static case is described with the kubo - toyabe function:@xcite @xmath134 the strong collision model was used in ref .   for estimate of the hopping rate @xmath135 .",
    "muon spin polarization within this model is described as follows:@xcite @xmath136 the result of zf @xmath0sr measurement at 1.6 k is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : zf ] .",
    "time dependent asymmetry spectra are analyzed with the expression : @xmath137 and is shown with the solid line .",
    "the model describes the measured spectrum well . for comparison with dotted line the spectrum for @xmath138",
    "is also shown .",
    "above , the first term describes the signal of the nb sample while the second term is the silver background signal .",
    "initial asymmetries are found to be @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "zf nuclear depolarization rate and muon hopping rate are @xmath141 @xmath0s@xmath42 and @xmath142 mhz , respectively .",
    "this hopping rate is somewhat smaller than that reported in ref .  .",
    "however , as we can see from comparison of zf spectra measured in the present work and that of ref .  ,",
    "6(a ) the relaxation is indeed smaller .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of a particle in classical statistical physics is related to its mean velocity @xmath143 and its mean free path @xmath144 through the following relation : @xmath145 the lattice constant of metallic nb and consequently the maximal distance between neighboring muon stopping sites is 0.33 nm .",
    "therefore , for a muon hopping rate of 0.13 mhz and a mean free path of the order of lattice constant we obtain the diffusion coefficient @xmath146  nm@xmath147@xmath0s@xmath42 at 1.6 k. this value is two orders of magnitude smaller than the tf @xmath0sr sensitivity to muon diffusion due to the finite muon lifetime:@xcite 1  nm@xmath148s@xmath42 and it is four orders of magnitude smaller than 80(20 )  nm@xmath147@xmath0s@xmath42 reported by schwarz _",
    "et al._@xcite this discrepancy can be explained by number of effects which were not considered in the analysis of the field distribution smearing around a vortex core field in ref .  .",
    "namely , at present it is well established that in tf @xmath0sr besides muon diffusion the smearing of @xmath106 is substantially influenced by a large number of other factors , such as : gradients and fluctuations of applied field and temperature , various kinds of vortex disorder , and nuclear fields.@xcite this led to a substantial overestimate of muon diffusion rate and consequently @xmath149  nm@xmath147@xmath0s@xmath42 ( at 4.6  k ) can be considered as the uppermost limit of a possible muon diffusion in nb .",

    "we simulate the influence of the muon diffusion on @xmath106 and compare with our measured field distribution .",
    "only the bcs - gorkov model can explain the measured field distribution , in particular the high - field tail .",
    "we proceeded as follows .",
    "first the magnetic field and its gradient was computed [ @xmath51 and @xmath159 using numerical solution of gl for @xmath160  nm and @xmath161  nm as obtained for spectrum measured at 1.6 k and @xmath162 mt in the main text ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : brders ] ) . then the tf muon spin polarization was computed using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : polarization1 ] ) and ( [ eq : blochsolutiontf ] ) .",
    "finally , the field distribution was obtained by fourier transformation of the apodized polarization function , as explained in the main text .",
    "the results of the computations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcbdiff ] . in solid line",
    "we show the curve for @xmath163 nm@xmath148s@xmath42 .",
    "as expected the curve is not a proper description of the measured distribution .",
    "note that this curve differs from that shown for 1.6 k in the main text , since here the gaussian smearing originating from nuclear fields and vortex disorder is set to zero .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig : dcbdiff ] demonstrates an effect of smearing solely due to muon diffusion . with increasing @xmath164 smearing of the field distribution increases .",
    "but still none of the computed distribution approaches closely the measured distribution . interestingly",
    ", a linear high - field tail is predicted at @xmath165  nm@xmath148s@xmath42 .",
    "however , as deduced from our zero - field measurements , it is not justified to consider large @xmath164 values .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that important is not only a linear tail but also the spectral weight of the field distribution close to @xmath107 .",
    "muon probes vortex lattice space randomly .",
    "thus , the probability to find a muon at a distance @xmath166 from the vortex core is proportional to the circular area : @xmath167 . for @xmath86 and @xmath168 the bcs field profile along the line crossing two neighboring vortex cores has a sawtooth - like shape while for the ngl model it is a cosine function ( see these profiles e.g. in ref .  ) . with a good approximation",
    "the field in the vicinity of the vortex core depends only on @xmath166 and can be expanded in taylor series : @xmath169 ( for bcs ) and @xmath170 ( for ngl ) .",
    "here , derivatives @xmath171 and @xmath172 , with @xmath173 . inverse of these functions are : @xmath174 here we denote @xmath175 .",
    "consequently the probability field distributions in the vicinity of a vortex core can be approximated as follows : @xmath176 note that above we consider that a positive d@xmath177 corresponds to a negative @xmath178 .",
    "consequently the ratio of probability field distributions is @xmath179 . for an intervortex distance @xmath180 the first derivative of the conically shaped vortex lattice @xmath181 , while for the cosine second derivative @xmath182 .",
    "here @xmath183 denotes difference between maximal and minimal fields along the line between the neighboring vortices .",
    "therefore the ratio of spectral weights of probability field distribution in the vicinity of vortex core can be expressed as : @xmath184 . since @xmath185 close to the vortex core",
    "the spectral weight of the ngl model is appreciably larger than that of the bcs model . considering next terms in the taylor expansion",
    "this is valid for @xmath186 .",
    "the region of the field distribution close to @xmath107 is a direct fingerprint of the spatial field profile close to the vortex core .",
    "reduction of @xmath187 spectral weight in the field range marked with @xmath188 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcbdiff ] directly points to the narrowing of vortex core towards the conical - like shape .",
    "as can be seen a smearing does not reduce appreciably this spectral weight .",
    "experimentally the smearing strength can be estimated from the sharpness of the cut - off in @xmath187 near @xmath107 ( indicated by the arrow in fig . [",
    "fig : dcbdiff ] ) .",
    "thus , the reduction of the spectral weight in the experimental spectrum is basically determined by the field profile in the vicinity of vortex core .",
    "it is known that a vortex lattice may be pinned on local defects of the crystal lattice .",
    "the pinning strength substantially depends on concentration and character of pinning centers . for dirty nb superconducting samples with a large concentration of pinning centers and a large upper critical field ( @xmath189 mt ) small angle neutron scattering ( sans )",
    "experiments showed a bragg glass state with a diffraction pattern which depends on the history of applied field and temperature.@xcite enhanced pinning of the vortex lattice may occur on the surface due to usually larger defect concentration at the surface of a sample.@xcite these effects may be even more pronounced in the vicinity of @xmath4 due to the peak effect . in order to exclude vortex lattice distortions due to pinning and",
    "measure a sample in a condition close to thermodynamic equilibrium , a field cooling procedure is usually used .",
    "measurements are performed after relaxation of the vortex lattice to its equilibrium state .",
    "extreme deviation of vl from its equilibrium state may be obtained in zero field cooling ( zfc ) condition . in this case the sample is cooled in zero field and afterwards a field is applied .",
    "vortices cross the surface and travel across the sample ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "if there are even moderate concentration of pinning centers the vl will be far from its equilibrium state ( see e.g. ref .  ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zfcufc ] we show zfc and fc measurements of @xmath190 for our nb sample at the lowest temperature ( 1.5 k ) and 360 mt carried out on the dolly instrument at the paul scherrer institute .",
    "note that the pinning is expected to be strongest at the lowest temperatures due to the reduction of the thermal excitations of vl . within experimental uncertainties",
    "these two field distributions coincide confirming the high purity of the sample and its low concentration of pinning centers .",
    "this experiment demonstrates that deviations from ginzburg - landau predictions summarized in the main text can not be ascribed to pinning effects in the sample .",
    "as described in the main text in the clean limit a form factors and consequently a field distribution depends on the three parameters @xmath191 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
