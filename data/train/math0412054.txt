    "the symbolic method , nowadays known as _ umbral calculus _ , has been extensively used since the nineteenth century although the mathematical community was sceptic of it , maybe owing to its lack of foundation .",
    "this method was fully developed by rev .",
    "john blissard in a series of papers beginning from 1861 @xcite@xmath1@xcite , nevertheless it is impossible to attribute the credit of the originary idea just to him since the blissard s calculus has a mathematical source in the symbolic differentiation . in @xcite lucas even claimed that the umbral calculus has its historical roots in the writing of leibniz for the successive derivatives of a product with two or several factors .",
    "moreover lucas held that this symbolic method had been subsequently developed by laplace , by vandermonde , by herschel and augmented by the works of cayley and of sylvester in the theory of forms .",
    "lucas s papers attracted considerable attention and the predominant contribution of blissard to this method was kept in the background .",
    "bell reviewed the whole subject in several papers , restoring the purport of the blissard s idea @xcite and in 1940 he tried to give a rigorous foundation of the mystery at the ground of the umbral calculus @xcite .",
    "it was gian - carlo rota @xcite who twenty - five years later disclosed the umbral magic art@xmath0 of lowering and raising exponents bringing to the light the underlying linear functional .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite the ideas from @xcite led rota and his collaborators to conceive a beautiful theory originating a large variety of applications .",
    "some years later , roman and rota gave rigorous form to the umbral tricks in the setting of the hopf algebra .",
    "on the other hand , as rota himself has written @xcite : ... although the notation of hopf algebra satisfied the most ardent advocate of spic - and - span rigor , the translation of classical@xmath0 umbral calculus into the newly found rigorous language made the method altogether unwieldy and unmanageable .",
    "not only was the eerie feeling of witchcraft lost in the translation , but , after such a translation , the use of calculus to simplify computation and sharpen our intuition was lost by the wayside ...",
    "@xmath0 thus in 1994 rota and taylor @xcite started a rigorous and simple presentation of the umbral calculus in the spirit of the founders .",
    "the present article refers to this last point of view .",
    "as it sometimes happens in the practice of the mathematical investigation , the subject we deal with does not develop the originary idea from which our research started in the spring of 1997 , but this paper is closely related to it . in that period",
    ", gian - carlo rota was visiting professor at the university of basilicata and , during one of our latest conversations before his leaving , he shared with us his close interest for a research project : a combinatorial random variable theory . the delicate question arising from the underlying foundation side and the left short time led us to protract the discussion via e - mail intertwining it with different activities for several months . the following year , gian - carlo rota held his last course in cortona and we did not miss the opportunity to spend some time with him .",
    "we resumed the thread of our conversations and presented him with the doubts that gradually took hold of us .",
    "as usually , his contribution disclosed new horizons that have led us to write these pages .",
    "our starting point is the umbral notion of the bell numbers .",
    "many classical identities relating to these numbers are expressed in umbral notation attaining up to a new umbra , the partition umbra , connected with the so - called partition polynomials@xmath0 generated by expanding the exponential function @xmath2 into an exponential power series .",
    "the hereafter developed theory of the bell umbrae is not only an example of the computational power of the umbral calculus but it offers , we would like to believe , a natural way to interpret the functional composition of exponential power series tested by a new proof of the lagrange inversion formula . here",
    "the point operations extended with a new one play a central role . from a probabilistic point of view , the functional composition of exponential power series is closely related to the family of poisson random variables so that these random variables have found a natural umbral interpretation through the bell umbrae . in particular the probabilistic counterpoint of the partition umbra is the compound poisson random variable .",
    "also the less familiar randomized poisson random variable unexpectedly find an umbral corresponding and in turn the umbral composition gives the way to generalize this last poisson random variable .",
    "what s more , we believe that the probabilistic interpretation of the partition umbra and of the umbral composition could give a probabilistic meaning to the joyal species theory @xcite , namely a combinatorial random variable theory that we hope to deal in forthcoming publication .",
    "we take a step forward in the program of the rigorous foundation of the classical umbral calculus initiated by rota and taylor @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath3 a commutative integral domain whose quotient field is of characteristic zero and by @xmath4 a set whose elements are called _",
