    "in finite - temperature field theory it is known that a naive implementation of perturbation theory for the calculation of feynman diagrams is ill - defined in the presence of massless bosons .",
    "this is due to the appearance of severe infrared divergences , brought about by the vanishing bosonic matsubara mode in thermal propagators .",
    "these divergences plague the entire series , which becomes essentially meaningless @xcite . as a result ,",
    "one is forced to resort to resummation techniques that reorganize the perturbative series , and resum certain classes of diagrams , in order to extract sensible results .",
    "there are several ways of performing resummations and rewriting the degrees of freedom more efficiently in terms of quasiparticles ; we refer the reader to the reviews @xcite and to ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion and a list of specific references .",
    "all such techniques are designed to partially tame the infrared divergences , creating a non - zero domain of validity for weak - coupling expansions .",
    "nevertheless , the zero - mode problem remains , and the region of validity of resummed perturbative treatments can not be indefinitely enlarged .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have proposed an alternative approach to thermal field theories , denoted by boundary effective theory ( bet ) .",
    "the central idea of the method is to respect the double integral structure of the partition function in the functional integral formalism ,    [ eq : z ] @xmath0\\;\\rho[\\beta ; \\phi_0,\\phi_0]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 = \\int\\limits_{\\phi(0,\\x)=\\phi(\\beta,\\x)=\\phi_0(\\x)}[d\\phi(\\tau,\\x)]\\ ; \\;\\;\\;\\ ; e^{-s[\\phi]}\\;\\ ] ]    is the diagonal element of the functional density matrix and @xmath2 $ ] is the euclidean action of the theory .",
    "this approach , based on the calculation of the density matrix , was already used in @xcite to construct dimensionally reduced effective actions , and in @xcite to study the thermodynamics of scalar fields based on a semiclassical approximation .",
    "the functional density matrix formulation of quantum statistics was discussed in @xcite .",
    "as it will be clear in the sequence of this article , the double integration approach is essentially different from the one where a single functional integration over periodic configurations @xmath3 is performed . in the bet approach ,",
    "the protagonist is the quantity @xmath4  the field eigenvalue in the functional schrdinger field - representation : @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , any thermal observable can be constructed by integrating the appropriate functional of @xmath4 over the fields @xmath4 weighted by the corresponding diagonal element of the density matrix .",
    "the imaginary time evolution can be viewed as an intermediate step which calculates the weights for the effective theory of static @xmath6-fields .",
    "that effective theory defines a quantum statistical problem which encodes all information about thermalization ; one is led to compute correlations of the field @xmath4 , connecting the theory to physical quantities .",
    "the field @xmath4 has still another remarkable property : it is the zero ( static ) component of the dynamical field @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , to each dynamical configuration @xmath3 there corresponds a static configuration @xmath7 .",
    "we say that @xmath4 is the ( time ) boundary value of @xmath3 .",
    "the difference @xmath8 vanishes at @xmath9 , and so it can be expanded in a sine - fourier series with non - zero frequencies @xmath10 . from these considerations",
    ", we conclude that the effective theory encoded in @xmath11 $ ] also contains all the infrared physics , and the double integral structure of @xmath12 naturally separates the potentially divergent modes .    the main result of ref .",
    "@xcite was the analytic calculation of the one - loop effective action for the boundary field in a scalar theory .",
    "following the standard recipe , we used the saddle - point approximation , but in two steps : first , we kept @xmath4 fixed , and expanded the action around the classical configuration @xmath13 $ ]  that has @xmath4 as its boundary value , and integrated over quadratic fluctuations vanishing at @xmath9 ; then , we expanded the resulting expression around the saddle - point @xmath14 , and took into account quadratic fluctuations of the boundary field .",
    "we showed that the one - loop effective action at finite temperature has the same expression as at zero temperature if written in terms of the classical field @xmath15 and if we trade free propagators at zero temperature by their finite temperature counterparts .",
    "besides , we explained how to obtain a renormalized effective action in the case of a @xmath16 theory .",
    "now we address the problem of computing the pressure of the single - well quartic theory in the ( problematic ) massless limit and testing the aforementioned advantages of our framework .",
    "the weak - coupling calculation of the pressure for the massless hot scalar theory is an enterprise of about twenty years so far @xcite , with recent results to order @xmath17 given in ref .",
    "moreover , attempts to reorganize the perturbative series have followed different paths , generally introducing one or more variational parameters in the pressure , to be maximized in the end . among these non - perturbative methods",
    "we find screened perturbation theory ( spt ) , introduced in thermal field theory in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can also be implemented in the framework called optimized perturbation theory ( opt ) presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the linear @xmath18-expansion ( lde ) @xcite , and the so - called 2pi or @xmath19-derivable methods @xcite .",
    "all these methods , when applied to the thermodynamics of the scalar field , are remarkably more stable than the weak - coupling expansion ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for results using spt , refs .",
    "@xcite for lde , and refs .",
    "@xcite for 2pi ) .    due to the crucial role played by classical solutions",
    "@xmath13 $ ] in the present approach ( they are supposed to satisfy the euler - lagrange equation for arbitrary values of the coupling constant ) , the resulting pressure is essentially non - perturbative .",
    "some technical difficulties arise , though . decomposing the field as @xmath20(\\tau,\\x ) + \\eta(\\tau,\\x)$ ] , where @xmath21 , introduces ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in the calculation . in order to obtain a finite result , we use the renormalized effective action as derived in ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition , spurious uv divergences appear if one naively performs the saddle - point approximation and ignores higher order terms in the fluctuation @xmath22 and in the fluctuations of the boundary field .",
    "a finite expression for the pressure is obtained by taking into account the first term in the expansion of the self - interaction .",
    "the procedure to avoid uv divergences can , in principle , be extended , allowing for a systematic calculation of higher order corrections .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ fixedbnd ] , we discuss the saddle - point approximation for the functional integration with fixed boundary configuration @xmath4 , and how to implement corrections to that approximation ; besides , we write the partition function in terms of the effective action for the boundary field ; in section [ bnffluctuation ] , we perform the second functional integration using , again , the saddle - point method , and a renormalized expression for the pressure is obtained ; finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "let us consider the euclidean action , @xmath23= \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\beta } ( d^4x)_{_e}\\ , \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial^\\mu\\phi+ \\frac{m_0 ^ 2}{2}\\phi^2 +   u(\\phi)\\right]\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is a shorthand for @xmath25 . in this paper , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for single - well potentials like @xmath28 , the unique saddle - point of the action",
    "@xmath29 is the trivial vacuum @xmath30 .",
    "however , in the density matrix approach , the functional domain of integration is partitioned in classes where all field configurations have the same time boundary .",
    "the restriction of @xmath29 to one of those classes ( for instance , the one with boundary value @xmath4 ) has a non - trivial saddle - point @xmath13 $ ] , solution of    [ eqmotion ] @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the euclidean dalembertian operator and @xmath33 denotes @xmath34 .",
    "the first functional integration , being performed over configurations inside a certain class , will be dominated by fluctuations in the vicinity of the saddle - point of that class .",
    "in particular , the correspondence @xmath35 $ ] is 1:1 for single - well potentials .",
    "therefore , one obtains an optimized spanning of the domain of integration in the calculation of @xmath12 by collecting the contributions from quadratic fluctuations around a line of saddle - point configurations , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig : partition ] .",

    "we have to be careful to identify the good propagator to represent the contraction of two @xmath6 fields .",
    "we know that such a propagator should be calculated at the saddle - point @xmath77 . however , it is not obvious if the interacting mass should enter or not its definition .",

    "a pragmatic argument in favor of using lines of @xmath78 ( or @xmath80 ) to build 2-loop corrections is that it solves the problem of uv divergences of the saddle - point approximation , reproducing the correct result for the @xmath75 perturbative contribution .",

    "however , in that range the spt curves are not reliable either . in fig .",
    "4 , we add the @xmath85 weak - coupling curve to the comparison . around @xmath89 ,",
    "spt curves present quite a large oscillation as one goes from two to three , and then to four loops .",
    "we conclude that in the range where spt shows convergence , the curve from bet seems to behave remarkably well .",
    "the boundary effective theory ( bet ) was introduced as an alternative approach to quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "one of its main features is providing a natural separation of the zero mode ( static ) sector , leading to the construction of its effective theory which results from integrating over all the ( imaginary time ) dynamical modes . in previous work",
    ", the one - loop effective action for the zero mode had been calculated . in the present article , we have shown that bet is also a powerful method to attack a crucial problem of the thermodynamics of bosonic fields : infrared divergences .",
    "the different strategies currently known to deal with such ir problems rely on some sort of resummation of diagrams of naive perturbation theory .",
    "the present calculation of the pressure using bet has the advantage of performing a highly nontrivial resummation in the scope of a natural and systematic procedure .",
    "in fact , the effective theory for the zero mode generated the whole series of daisy diagrams very naturally .",
    "besides , in contrast with those built from thermal field theory , the daisy diagrams built in the context of bet fit quite well recent results in the literature obtained using rather involved techniques of screening perturbation theory at 4-loops .",
    "a distinctive feature of bet is the role played by field configurations which are not strictly periodic in the imaginary time .",
    "indeed , following the double integral scheme for the partition function , we have shown that there is a line of saddle - point configurations dominating the functional integral and all of them , but the trivial one , are non - periodic .",
    "we saw that the separation of the the field in its static and dynamical parts could lead to problems in the ultraviolet limit .",
    "this technical point has already been addressed in the calculation of the one - loop effective action .",
    "the solution is to perform a parallel calculation of the two functional integrations in the definition of the partition function . that led to a prescription for",
    "the present calculation which , we hope , can serve as a guide to extend the method to higher orders .",

    "<S> we use the boundary effective theory ( bet ) approach to thermal field theory in order to calculate the pressure of a system of massless scalar fields with quartic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the method naturally separates the infrared physics , and is essentially non - perturbative . </S>",
    "<S> to lowest order , the main ingredient is the solution of the free euler - lagrange equation with non - trivial ( time ) boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a resummed pressure , which is in good agreement with recent calculations found in the literature , following a very direct and compact procedure . </S>"
