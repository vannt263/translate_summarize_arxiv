    "many large photometric surveys were recently published : ogle - iii @xcite , asas @xcite , nsvs @xcite , hatnet @xcite , tres @xcite , superwasp @xcite , _ corot _",
    "@xcite , _ kepler _",
    "@xcite , etc . after reaching the survey s original purpose ,",
    "the huge photometric data - sets collected by these surveys were released for the community and allowed to extract ( as a by - product ) a great number of light curves of known and newly discovered variable stars . some of them were objects of study using automated pipelines but only a small part of them were targets of follow - up by precise observations and analysis .",
    "searching for binary systems for follow - up observations with periods below 0.23 d in the photometric surveys we noted the object t - and0 - 10518 in the list of 773 eclipsing binaries @xcite found on the basis of the tres data .",
    "it was classified as `` ambiguous eb '' with coordinates @xmath1=01@xmath2 and @xmath3=+@xmath4 .",
    "its period of 0.1935761 d ( see table 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fulfills our criterion for a short - period binary appropriate for follow - up observations .",
    "we began these at the beginning of 2011 and found this binary to be a new nova - like system .",
    "the paper presents the results from this study .",
    "our ccd photometric observations in @xmath0 bands were carried out at rozhen national astronomical observatory with the 60-cm cassegrain telescope using the fli pl09000 ccd camera ( 3056 x 3056 pixels , 12 @xmath5m / pixel , field of 27.0 x 27.0 arcmin with focal reducer ) .",
    "the average photometric precisions per data point in b , v and i bands are 0.020 , 0.010 and 0.008 mag respectively .",
    "the spectra of the target were obtained by the 2-m rcc telescope equipped with versarray ccd camera ( 512 @xmath6 512 pixels , 24 @xmath5 m pixel , field of 6 @xmath6 6 arcmin ) and focal reducer forero-2 .",
    "the resolution of our spectra is 5.223  / pixel and they cover the range 50007000   using a grism with 300 lines / mm .",
    "table [ tab : log1 ] presents the journal of our observations .",
    ".journal of the photometric and spectroscopic observations [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the criteria for the subtype classification of the nova - like stars are not firm and a given star may belong to several subtypes @xcite .",
    "we tried to determine the subtype of 2mass j01074282 + 4845188 on the basis of several considerations .",
    "\\(a ) the presence of broad h@xmath1 emission excludes its classification as a ux uma subtype .",
    "\\(b ) the single - peaked shape of the h@xmath1 emission line and its fast variability are typical for sw sex - subtype stars .",
    "\\(c ) the fwhm and fwzi of the h@xmath1 line fall into the ranges for sw sex stars for which balmer and hei emission lines have a relatively narrow fwhm ( around 1000 km s@xmath7 ) but large fwzi ( 2000 - 3000 km s@xmath7 ) .",
    "\\(d ) the sw sex stars are intrinsically very luminous due to high mass transfer rate .",
    "2mass j01074282 + 4845188 is also a quite luminous source ( @xmath8=4.5 mag ) .",
    "\\(e ) although the orbital period of 4.65 h of the target is slightly above the period range 3  4.5 h for most sw sex subtype stars it does not exclude the sw sex - subtype classification of 2mass j01074282 + 4845188 because there are several other exceptions from this criterion ( see table 6 in @xcite ) .    hence , the rozhen data directed us to sw sex - subtype classification of 2mass j01074282 + 4845188 . due to the lack of prolonged photometric observations and high - resolution spectra we are not able to check the further criteria of this subtype classification .    the depth of the light minimum of the rozhen curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rozhen ] ) is 2.7 mag in @xmath9 band while the light amplitudes of tres and superwasp light curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tres ] ) are considerably smaller .",
    "the situation is very similar to the false positives of exoplanet candidates in the tres survey ( for instance exoplanet candidate t - cyg1 - 14777 , see fig . 5 in * ?",
    ".    it should be noted that among around 2000 known cataclysmic stars only several hundred are nova - like and only several tens of them are eclipsing .",
    "usually the eclipse depths of nova - like variables are @xmath10 1 mag .",
    "the deepest eclipses belong to the sw sex stars .",
    "only nine sw sex stars in the list of @xcite have eclipse depths above 2.0 mag but smaller than that of 2mass j01074282 + 4845188 ( 2.7 mag ) .",
    "deeper eclipses of 3.2  3.4 mag have been registered for two sw sex stars , dw uma @xcite and v1315 aql @xcite , but only during time intervals of 2  3 days whereas normally their eclipse depths are below 2.0 mag .",
    "thus our study not only added a new member to the small family of eclipsing nova - like stars but 2mass j01074282 +",
    "4845188 turned out to have one of the deepest eclipses .",
    "it is possible for the big depth of its eclipse to be transient effect as in the cases of dw uma and v1315 aql .",
    "the main results of our investigation are :    ( 1 ) : :    the v - shape of the eclipse , the phase behaviour of the colour indices    as well as the presence of standstill , pre - eclipse hump and flickering    allow us to conclude that 2mass j01074282 + 4845188 is a nova - like    cataclysmic variable . ( 2 ) : :    the broad emission h@xmath1 line of 2mass    j01074282 + 4845188 is typical for a fast - rotating accretion disk of the    nova - like cataclysmic stars . the single h@xmath1 profile    with a relatively narrow fwhm but",
    "large fwzi is typical for the sw sex    subtype of the nova - like variables .",
    "( 3 ) : :    the deep eclipses observed at the beginning of 2011 make the newly    discovered cataclysmic star 2mass j01074282 + 4845188 an interesting    object for future observations and investigation .",
