    "<S> the evidence of a large cp phase has been shown by cdf and d collaborations in the time - dependent cp asymmetry ( cpa ) of @xmath0 decay , where the nonvanished cpa clearly implies the existence of a non - kobayashi - maskawa phase in @xmath1 transition . </S>",
    "<S> we study the new phases originated by the extra family dependent @xmath2 model and examine their impact on @xmath3 or @xmath4 violating observables in @xmath5 decays with @xmath6 . adopting the constraints from the current data of @xmath7 and the branching ratios for @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we find that @xmath10 and the t - odd observables of above @xmath11 in the decay chain @xmath12 ) \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ ] can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we demonstrate that the longitudinal and transverse polarizations of @xmath13 and the up - down asymmetry of @xmath14 in the same decay chain are also sensitive to the @xmath15-mediated effects .    </S>",
    "<S> although three generations of the standard model ( sm ) provide a unique cp violating phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite to interpret the observed cp violating phenomena in @xmath14 and @xmath16 systems , due to the failure of the km phase in the explanation of matter - antimatter asymmetry , some new source of cp violation ( cpv ) is expected . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is an important issue to probe and find the new cp violating effects . by the @xmath17 production in tevatron run </S>",
    "<S> ii , cdf and d have observed the @xmath17 oscillation of @xmath18 ps@xmath19 @xcite and @xmath20 ps@xmath19 @xcite , respectively , and the large direct cp asymmetry ( cpa ) of @xmath21 for @xmath22 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , surprisingly both detectors have also shown an unexpected large cp phase in the mixing - induced cpa for @xmath23 with the average value given by @xcite ^j/_s=-2_s + ^np_s= -2[0.10 , 1.42][eq : phis ] at the @xmath24 confidence level ( cl ) , where @xmath25 @xcite is the cp phase of the sm while @xmath26 is a phase from new physics . if the measurement of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : phis ] ) indicates the existence of a new cp phase in @xmath1 transition @xcite , it is interesting to expose the effects in other @xmath1 related phenomena , such as the puzzles of cpas in @xmath27 and of polarizations in @xmath28 . nevertheless , as known that owing to the inevitable large uncertainty of nonperturbative qcd effects , it is difficult to definitely uncover the new cp phase from the cpas of the nonleptonic exclusive decays . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the best environment to look for new phase is that qcd effects are less involved and sm contributions are highly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we propose that the large cp violating phase in @xmath1 transition can be directly probed by measuring t - odd observables in @xmath29 decays with @xmath30 .    to understand the property of @xmath3 violating approach for probing the new cp phase , we briefly discuss the characters of cp - odd and t - odd observables . in a decay process </S>",
    "<S> , the direct cpa or cp - odd observable is defined by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the partial decay rate of the ( cp - conjugate ) process . due to @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , it always needs weak cp phase @xmath35 and strong phase @xmath36 simultaneously to get the nonvanished cpa . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the prediction efficiency on such cpa is mainly dictated by the uncertain calculations of strong phase . </S>",
    "<S> another way to probe cp phase is through the spin - momentum triple correlation of @xmath37 @xcite , where @xmath38 is the spin carried by one of outgoing particles and @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote any two independent momentum vectors . </S>",
    "<S> the triple momentum correlation is t - odd observable since it changes sign under the time reversal ( @xmath41 ) transformation of @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath43 is used to distinguish from real time - reversal transformation which also contains the interchange of initial and final states . by the cp@xmath44 invariant theorem , @xmath43 violation ( tv ) implies cpv . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , study of the t - odd observable can also help us to understand the origin of cpv . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the triple correlation is proportional to @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads that the strong phase in t - odd observable is not necessary . to satisfy the criteria of a small qcd uncertainty with the high suppression in the sm for the @xmath1 transition mentioned earlier </S>",
    "<S> , we find that tv in @xmath46 with polarized vector meson could provide a good chance to directly observe the new phase revealed by cdf and d .    to search for the new cp phase in the extension of the sm , a model independent analysis is not suitable for the current study . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we investigate the minimal extension in the gauge sector by including one family dependent @xmath2 to the sm gauge symmetry , i.e. the considered gauge symmetry is @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> although lots of extensions of the sm predict additional @xmath2 gauge symmetry , such as string theory @xcite , grand unified theories @xcite , little higgs models @xcite , light u - boson model @xcite , etc , a well - motivated @xmath15 model for low energy systems is the so - called nonuniversal @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> besides the @xmath2 charges carried by the fermions are family dependent @xcite , the model also leads to flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) at tree level and provides the solution to the puzzles in @xmath16 physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent progress of the nonuniversal @xmath15 on the phenomenological applications could be referred to refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we start to set up the relevant interactions with the new @xmath15 gauge particle . following the convention in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we write the couplings of the @xmath15-boson to fermions as ^z&= & -g_2 j^f_z z _ , with j^f_z&= & |f ^ f , [ eq : jf ] where @xmath48 and the indexes @xmath49 ( i=1,2,3 ) denote the same type of quarks ( qs ) or charged leptons ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 are diagonal @xmath52 matrices in flavor space with @xmath53 and are represented by @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath55 could be different for different generations in the nonuniversal @xmath15 model . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter , @xmath55 are taken as free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> although the third component of @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the sm also provide two neutral gauge bosons , we will not show them explicitly since they involve only flavor conserved processes and are well known . to obtain the interactions in physical states </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce @xmath58 to diagonalize the associated yukawa matrix of fermion . in terms of mass eigenstates , eq .  ( [ eq : jf ] ) could be written as j^f_z&= & |f ^ f , [ eq : intzp ] + l^f & = & v^l_f v^l_f ,  r^f = v^r_f v^r_f . </S>",
    "<S> due to the unequal elements in @xmath59 , obviously , flavor misaligned effects in @xmath60 and @xmath61 will lead to fcncs at tree level .    in order to display the new physics effects with more compact form in the processes , we use vector and axial - vector currents instead chiral currents . thus , eq .  ( [ eq : intzp ] ) is rewritten by j^f_z&= & |f ^ f , + & = & + ,   = - . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the @xmath15-mediated interactions for @xmath1 are given by ^z_bs & = & -g_2 |s ^ ( c^q_vsb + c^q_asb _ 5 ) b z _ + h.c . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : int_bs ] for semileptonic decays , the couplings to the leptons are taken as ^z _ & = & -g_2 |^ ( c^_v + c^_a _ 5 ) z_. [ eq : int_ll ] since we will concentrate on the @xmath62-pair production , to avoid the problem on the lepton flavor violation and nonuniversality and simplify our analysis , we assume that @xmath63 are the same for different families , i.e. @xmath64 . in the following analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that the impacts of @xmath15-mediated fcncs on the processes of @xmath17 mixing , @xmath65 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> note that since we do nt have any information on @xmath66 except the ckm matrix defined by @xmath67 , the elements in @xmath68 should be regarded as free parameters . therefore , the parameters associated with the processes for @xmath69 and @xmath70 transitions could be independent of those associated with the @xmath1 transition .    </S>",
    "<S> based on the new effects , we now formulate the related phenomena for @xmath71 and @xmath72 processes . in terms of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : bsll_int ] the direct application of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : bsll_int ] ) , we need the hadronic effects for the @xmath92 transition . as usual , </S>",
    "<S> the form factors associated with various current operators are parametrized as @xmath93 with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 . here </S>",
