    "we shall not deal with type i hermite - pad approximants in this work and therefore henceforth we will drop the `` type ii '' modifier . such approximants were introduced by hermite @xcite for the vector of exponentials @xmath9 , with the interpolation taking place at the origin rather than at infinity , as a tool in proving the transcendence of @xmath10 .",
    "later , his student pad systematically studied the scalar case @xmath11 @xcite and such approximants are now called _",
    "pad approximants_.    from our perspective interpolating at infinity is more convenient than interpolating at the origin in the following sense .",
    "any holomorphic function can be written as a cauchy integral of its boundary values on any curve encircling a domain of analyticity . for a holomorphic function on a domain",
    "we will use the terminology _ trace _ to mean the boundary values of the function on the boundary of the domain .",
    "when the function is holomorphic at infinity , such an integral representation can in some important cases be deformed analytically into an integral over a `` one dimensional '' set .",
    "a particular fruitful example of this principle is when we deal with markov functions .",
    "let @xmath12 be a positive measure and take @xmath13\\subset{\\mathbb{r}}.\\ ] ] the vector @xmath3 is called an _ angelesco system _ if @xmath14\\cap[a_i , b_i]=\\varnothing$ ] for @xmath15 ( such systems were initially considered by angelesco @xcite and later rediscovered by nikishin @xcite ) .",
    "angelesco has shown that @xmath6 has exactly @xmath16 zeros on @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this means that an angelesco system is an example of a _ perfect _ system , i.e. , a system for which every multi - index is _ normal _ , that is , @xmath18 .",
    "as far as the asymptotic behavior of @xmath19 is concerned , convergence properties are not as straightforward as one could hope . given an angelesco system and a sequence of multi - indices such that @xmath20 , @xmath21 , gonchar and rakhmanov @xcite have shown that for each @xmath22 the complement of @xmath23 $ ] is separated by a system of analytic arcs into two domains , say @xmath24 , containing the point at infinity , and @xmath25 , possible empty , such that @xmath19 converges to @xmath26 in @xmath24 and diverges to infinity in @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , the polynomials @xmath6 can have an asymptotic zero distribution ( in the sense of weak@xmath27 convergence ) on a strict subset of @xmath28 ( _ pushing effect _ ) .",
    "the pushing effect always implies existence of a divergence region but the reverse implication is not true .",
    "more detailed ( strong ) asymptotics for hermite - pad approximants to angelesco systems when @xmath29 and the weights @xmath30 satisfy the so - called _ szeg condition _ , was obtained by the first author in @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite . the functions @xmath31 in form a nikishin system if they all are supported on the same interval @xmath32 $ ] and the radon - nikodym derivatives @xmath33 , @xmath34 , form a nikishin system of order @xmath35 with respect to some interval @xmath36 $ ] such that @xmath36\\cap[a , b]=\\varnothing$ ] .",
    "nikishin himself @xcite has shown that such systems are perfect when @xmath29 and the hermite - pad approximants converge uniformly outside of the interval @xmath32 $ ] in this case .",
    "this puts nikishin systems more in line with the pad case @xmath11 ( markov theorem @xcite ) as neither the pushing effect nor the possibility of non - empty divergence regions appears for them .",
    "however , nikishin systems do possess one new phenomenon , namely overinterpolation .",
    "it turns out that @xmath37 has zeros on @xmath36 $ ] that are dense on this interval .",
    "it took 30 years to prove that nikishin systems are perfect for any @xmath38 @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "fidalgo prieto and lpez lagomasino also proved uniform convergence for multi - indices close to the diagonal .",
    "strong asymptotics in the case of diagonal multi - indices and szeg weights was derived by the first author in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the first result on strong asymptotics of hermite - pad approximants was obtained by kalaygin @xcite for the case of two touching symmetric intervals ( the limiting case of an angelesco system ) .",
    "as often happens in mathematics , the treatment of angelesco and nikishin systems can be unified under the umbrella of _ generalized nikishin systems _",
    "( gn - systems ) as introduced in @xcite , where gonchar , rakhmanov , and sorokin defined a system of markov functions with the help of a rooted tree graph and considered the question of uniform convergence of hermite - pad approximants to such a system . in such a set - up",
    ", an angelesco system corresponds to a tree where the root is connected by @xmath38 edges to @xmath38 leaves and a nikishin system corresponds to a tree in which every node except for the final leaf has exactly one child .",
    "strong asymptotics of hermite - pad approximants to gn - systems of markov functions generated by more general ( than rooted tree ) graphs ( admitting cycles ) was derived by the first author and lysov in @xcite .",
    "an example of gn - system from @xcite is a pair of two markov functions in where the support of one of them is strictly included in the support of the other , i.e. , @xmath39 \\subset { \\mathsf{supp}}(\\mu_1)=[a_1,b_1 ] $ ] and the radon - nikodym derivative @xmath40 along @xmath41 $ ] is a markov function with support @xmath42 $ ] where @xmath43\\cap[a_1,b_1]=\\varnothing$ ] .",
    "weak asymptotics of hermite - pad approximants to this example of markov functions was derived by rakhmanov in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in all the results we listed above the _ geometry _ of the problem is _ real _",
    ", i.e. , the supports of the limiting distributions of the poles of the approximants and the overinterpolation points belong to @xmath44 .    in this paper",
    "we consider hermite - pad approximants to a pair of cauchy transforms ( markov functions ) of generally speaking complex measures with overlapping supports and aim at strong asymptotics .",
    "the set up does not fall into the framework of gn - systems , even when the measures are positive , as their supports overlap ( for gn - systems the supports are either disjoint or one coincides with or contains the other ) .",
    "it turns out that both phenomena , the pushing effect and overinterpolation , appear in this case .",
    "hermite - pad approximants to a pair of markov functions with overlapping supports were first considered by stahl with the goal of proving weak asymptotics @xcite .",
    "he had the important insight that the geometry of this problem is complex , i.e. , the overinterpolation points are distributed on analytic arcs in the complex plane ( later , a similar effect was observed in @xcite ) .",
    "this discovery was very unusual at the time because the input geometry ( i.e. , the supports of the measures generating the markov functions ) is completely real .",
    "unfortunately , stahl s results have never been published .",
    "this work was strongly motivated by the desire to provide a detailed proof of his findings ( in an even more delicate setting of strong asymptotics ) .",
    "opting here for complex measures is natural from the point of view of complex analysis .",
    "however , many techniques , like those in @xcite , do not apply as they use positivity in an essential way .",
    "an approach that does not rely on positivity was outlined by nuttall in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "there nuttall conjectured that the main term of the asymptotics of hermite - pad approximants is a function solving of a certain _ explicit _ boundary value problem on some _ unknown _ riemann surface .",
    "he identified this surface only in a handful of special cases .",
    "elaborating on nuttall s approach , the first two authors and kuijlaars @xcite pinpointed the algebraic equation which defines the appropriate riemann surface in the case of two cauchy transforms of complex measures supported on two arcs joining pairs of branch points in the complex plane ( the simplest example is a complexified angelesco system ) and derived formulae of strong asymptotics in the case when the riemann surface has genus zero .",
    "below , we build upon the ideas developed in @xcite and extend the results of @xcite to the cases when the appropriated riemann surface has positive genus ( elliptic and ultra- elliptic case ) .    in section  [ sec : rs ] we identify the riemann surface in nuttall s program by an algebraic equation , discuss its realization as a ramified cover of @xmath45 , and construct a certain function on this surface whose level lines will geometrically describe convergence and divergence domains of the approximants . in section  [ sec : ns ]",
    ", we construct the nuttall - szeg functions that will provide the leading term of the asymptotics of the hermite - pad approximants .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : hp ] we state the main result of this work .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is devoted to the proofs of all the stated results .",
