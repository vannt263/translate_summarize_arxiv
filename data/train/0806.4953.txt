    "the final event in the life of a massive star is the catastrophic collapse of its central , electron - degenerate core composed of iron - peak nuclei .",
    "when silicon shell burning pushes the iron core over its effective chandrasekhar mass , collapse is initiated by a combination of electron capture and photo - disintegration of heavy nuclei , both leading to a depletion of central pressure support .",
    "massive stars in the approximate mass range of about @xmath0 to @xmath1 solar masses ( @xmath2 ) experience such a collapse phase until their homologously contracting  @xcite inner core reaches densities near and above nuclear saturation density where the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) stiffens , leading to an almost instantaneous rebound of the inner core ( core bounce ) into the still supersonically infalling outer core .",
    "the hydrodynamic supernova shock is born , travels outward in radius and mass , but rapidly loses its kinetic energy to the dissociation of infalling iron - group nuclei and to neutrinos that deleptonize the immediate postshock material and stream off from these regions quasi - freely .",
    "the shock stalls , turns into an accretion shock and must be revived to produce the observable explosion associated with a core - collapse supernova",
    ". mechanisms of shock revival are still under debate ( a recent review is presented in  @xcite , but see also  @xcite ) and may involve heating of the postshock region by neutrinos , multi - dimensional hydrodynamic instabilities of the accretion shock , in the postshock region , and/or in the proto - neutron star , rotation , magnetic fields , and nuclear burning .",
    "if the shock is not revived , black - hole formation ( on a timescale of @xmath3  @xcite ) is inevitable and the stellar collapse event may remain undetected by conventional astronomy or , perhaps , appear as a gamma - ray burst if the progenitor star has a compact enough envelope and sufficiently rapid rotation in its central regions  @xcite .",
    "conventional astronomy can constrain core - collapse supernova theory and the supernova explosion mechanism via secondary observables only , e.g. , the explosion energy , ejecta morphology , nucleosynthesis yields , residue neutron star or black hole mass and proper motion , and pulsar magnetic fields .",
    "neutrinos and gravitational waves , on the other hand , are emitted deep inside the supernova core and travel to observers on earth practically unscathed by intervening material .",
    "they can act as messengers to provide first - hand and live dynamical information on the intricate multi - dimensional dynamics of the proto - neutron star and postshock region and may constrain directly the core - collapse supernova mechanism .",
    "importantly , core - collapse events that do not produce the canonical observational astronomical signature or whose observational display is shrouded from view can still be observed in neutrinos and gravitational waves if occurring sufficiently close to earth .",
    "gravitational waves , in contrast to neutrinos , have not yet been observed directly , but an international array of gravitational wave observatories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is active and taking data . since gravitational waves from astrophysical sources",
    "are expected to be weak , their detection is notoriously difficult and involves extensive signal processing and detailed analysis of the detector output .",
    "chances for the detection of an astrophysical event of gravitational wave emission are significantly enhanced if accurate theoretical knowledge of the expected gravitational wave signature from such an event is at hand .",
    "theoretical predictions of the gravitational wave signature from a core - collapse supernova are complicated , since the emission mechanisms are very diverse . while the prospective gravitational wave burst signal from the collapse , bounce , and",
    "the very early postbounce phase is present only when the core rotates  @xcite , gravitational wave signals with sizeable amplitudes can also be expected from convective motions at postbounce times , instabilities of the standing accretion shock , anisotropic neutrino emission , excitation of various oscillations in the proto - neutron star , or nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities  @xcite .    in the observational search for gravitational waves from merging black hole or neutron star binaries , powerful data analysis algorithms such as matched filtering",
    "are applicable , as the waveform from the inspiral phase can be modeled with high accuracy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and gravitational wave data analysts already have access to robust template waveforms that depend only on a limited number of macroscopic parameters .",
    "in contrast , the complete gravitational wave signature of a core - collapse supernova can not be predicted with template - level accuracy as the postbounce dynamics involve chaotic processes ( turbulence , [ magneto- ] hydrodynamic instabilities ) that are sensitive not only to a multitude of precollapse parameters , but also to small - scale perturbations of any of the hydrodynamic variables .    while the complete supernova gravitational wave signature may remain inaccessible to template - based data analysis , a number of individual constituent emission processes , in particular those involving coherent global bulk dynamics and/or rotation , allow , in principle , for accurate and robust waveform predictions that may be applied to template - based searches . rotating core collapse and core",
    "bounce as well as pulsations or nonaxisymmetric rotational deformations of a proto - neutron star constitute this group of processes . among them",
    ", rotating collapse and bounce is the historically most extensively studied case ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a historical review ) and may be the most promising for becoming robustly predictable in its gravitational wave emission .",
    "yet , to date , the gravitational wave signal from rotating stellar core collapse and bounce has not been predicted with the desired accuracy and robustness .",
    "these deficiencies of previous simulations result from the fact that the physically realistic modeling of core collapse requires a general relativistic description of consistently coupled gravity and hydrodynamics in conjunction with a microphysical treatment of the sub- and supernuclear eos , electron capture on heavy nuclei and free protons , and neutrino radiation transport . only very few multi - dimensional general relativistic codes have recently begun to approach these requirements  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the properties of the eos around and above nuclear density are not very well constrained by theory or experiments .",
    "the same applies to the rotation rate and angular velocity profile of the progenitor core , which are also not directly accessible by observation and very difficult to model numerically in stellar evolution codes .",
    "furthermore , variations with progenitor structure and mass are to be expected .",
    "therefore , the influence of rotation and progenitor structure on the collapse and bounce dynamics and thus the gravitational wave burst signal must be investigated by extensive and computationally expensive parameter studies .",
    "previous parameter studies have considered a large variety of rotation rates and progenitor core configurations , but generally ignored important microphysical aspects and/or the influence of general relativity .",
    "mnchmeyer et al .",
    "@xcite performed axisymmetric newtonian calculations with progenitor models from stellar evolutionary studies .",
    "they employed the microphysical nuclear eos of hillebrandt and wolff  @xcite and included deleptonization via a neutrino leakage scheme and electron capture on free protons .",
    "capture on heavy nuclei was neglected , which resulted in a too high electron fraction @xmath4 at core bounce and a consequently overestimated inner core mass  @xcite . in that study a limited set of four calculations was computed and two qualitatively and quantitatively different types of gravitational wave burst signals were identified .",
    "their morphology can be classified alongside with the collapse and bounce dynamics : _ type  i _ signals are emitted when the collapse of the quasi - homologously contracting inner core is not strongly influenced by rotation , but stopped by a _ pressure - dominated bounce _ due to the stiffening of the eos near nuclear density @xmath5 , where the adiabatic index @xmath6 rises above @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to a bounce with a maximum core density @xmath8 . _",
    "type  ii _ signals occur when centrifugal forces , which grow during contraction owing to angular momentum conservation , are sufficiently strong to halt the collapse , resulting in consecutive ( typically multiple ) _ centrifugal bounces _ with intermediate coherent re - expansion of the inner core , seen as density drops by sometimes more than an order of magnitude ; thus here @xmath9 after bounce .",
    "type  i and  ii dynamics and waveforms were also found in the more recent newtonian studies by kotake et al .",
    "@xcite , who employed a more complete leakage / capture scheme , but still obtained too high @xmath4 at bounce , and by ott et al .",
    "@xcite , who performed an extensive parameter study and for the first time also considered variations in progenitor star structure , but neglected deleptonization during collapse .",
    "zwerger and mller  @xcite carried out an extensive two - dimensional newtonian study of rotating collapse of idealized polytropes in rotational equilibrium  @xcite with a simplified _ hybrid _ eos , consisting of a polytropic and a thermal component  @xcite .",
    "electron capture during collapse was mimicked by an instantaneous lowering of the adiabatic index @xmath6 from its initial value of @xmath7 to trigger the onset of collapse . at @xmath10",
    ", the adiabatic index was raised to @xmath11 to qualitatively model the stiffening of the nuclear eos .",
    "zwerger and mller also obtained the previously suggested signal types and introduced _",
    "type  iii _ signals that appear in a pressure - dominated bounce when the inner core has a very small mass due to very efficient electron capture ( approximated in  @xcite via a @xmath12 in their hybrid eos ) .",
    "obergaulinger et al .",
    "@xcite also employed the hybrid eos , but included magnetic fields .",
    "they introduced the additional dynamics / signal _ type  iv _ , which occurs only in the case of very strong precollapse core magnetization .",
    "they found that weak to moderate core magnetization in agreement with predictions from stellar evolution theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) has little effect on the collapse and bounce dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave signal .",
    "this finding is in agreement with  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , where magneto - rotational collapse simulations were performed , a smaller model set was considered , but the neutrino leakage scheme of  @xcite was employed and it was made use of two different microphysical eoss to study the eos dependence of the collapse dynamics and gravitational wave signal .",
    "the first extensive set of general relativistic simulations of rotating iron core collapse to a proto - neutron star were presented by dimmelmeier et al .",
    "@xcite , who employed an analytic hybrid eos and polytropic precollapse models in rotational equilibrium as initial data ( but see also the pioneering early work of  @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations were subsequently confirmed in  @xcite .",
    "dimmelmeier et al .",
    "studied a subset of the models in  @xcite in the same parameter space of rotation rate and degree of differential rotation , and found that general relativistic effects counteract centrifugal support and shift the occurrence of type  ii dynamics and wave signals to a higher precollapse rotation rate at a fixed degree of differential rotation .",
    "recently , new general relativistic simulations of rotating core collapse in two and three dimensions were carried out by ott et al .",
    "@xcite who included the microphysical eos of shen et al .",
    "@xcite , precollapse models from stellar evolutionary calculations as well as an approximate deleptonization scheme  @xcite .",
    "the results of these calculations indicate that the gravitational wave burst signal associated with rotating core collapse is _ exclusively of type  i_. in addition , the simulations showed that rotating stellar iron cores stay axisymmetric throughout collapse and bounce , and only at postbounce times develop nonaxisymmetric features .    in a general relativistic two - dimensional follow - up study ,",
    "dimmelmeier et al .",
    "@xcite considerably extended the number of models and comprehensively explored a wide parameter space of precollapse rotational configurations .",
    "even for this more general setup they found gravitational wave signals solely of type  i form , although for rapid precollapse rotation some of their models experience a core bounce due to centrifugal forces only , which however is always a _",
    "single centrifugal bounce _ rather than the multiple ones observed in earlier work ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "they identified the physical conditions that lead to the emergence of this generic gravitational wave signal type and quantified their relative influence .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the waveform of the gravitational wave burst signal from the collapse of rotating iron cores in a core - collapse event is much more generic than previously anticipated .    in this work ,",
    "we extend the above study of the gravitational wave signal from rotating core collapse and consider not only variations in the precollapse rotational configuration , but also in progenitor structure and nuclear eos . in this way",
    ", we carry out the to - date largest and most complete parameter study of rotating stellar core collapse that includes all the ( known ) necessary physics to produce reliable predictions of the gravitational wave signal associated with rotating collapse and bounce .",
    "all our computed gravitational wave signals are made available to the detector data analysis community in a freely accessible waveform catalog  @xcite .",
    "we perform a large number of two - dimensional simulations with our general relativistic core - collapse code coconut  and employ @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( masses at zero - age main sequence ) precollapse stellar models from the stellar evolutionary studies of heger et al .",

    "we study the prospects for nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities in our postbounce cores , which could lead to an enhancement of the gravitational wave signature .",
    "furthermore , we set our model gravitational radiation waveforms in context with present and future detector technology and assess their detectability .    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section : physical_model ] we introduce our treatment of the general relativistic spacetime curvature and hydrodynamics equations .",

    "imposing cfc in a spherically symmetric spacetime is equivalent to solving the exact einstein equations . for nonspherical configurations",
    "the cfc approximation may be roughly regarded as full general relativity without the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field that correspond to the gravitational wave content  @xcite . however , even spacetimes that do not contain gravitational waves can be not conformally flat .",
    "a prime example are the spacetime of a kerr black hole  @xcite or rotating fluids in equilibrium .",
    "for rapidly rotating models of stationary neutron stars the deviation of certain metric components from conformal flatness has been shown to reach up to @xmath59 in extreme cases  @xcite , while the oscillation frequencies of such models typically deviate even less from the corresponding values obtained in full general relativistic simulations  @xcite . in the context of rotating stellar core collapse the excellent quality of the cfc approximation has been demonstrated extensively  @xcite .",
    "due to its fully constrained nature , the cfc approximation permits a straightforward and numerically more robust implementation of the metric equations in coordinate systems containing coordinate singularities ( e.g. , spherical polar coordinates ) compared to a cauchy free - evolution scheme .",
    "furthermore , by definition it allows no constraint violations , which is a significant benefit in cases where a perturbation is added to the initial data .",
    "more details on the cfc equations can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .      in our simulations",
    "we employ two tabulated nonzero - temperature equations of state , the one by shen et al .",

    "the microphysical eos returns the fluid pressure ( and additional thermodynamic quantities ) as a function of @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the temperature .",
    "since the hydrodynamic equations  ( [ equation : conservation_equations ] ) operate on the specific internal energy @xmath68 , we determine the corresponding temperature @xmath67 iteratively with a newton  raphson scheme and the eos table .",
    "all interpolations are carried out in tri - linear fashion and the tables are sufficiently densely spaced to lead to an artificial entropy increase in an adiabatic collapse by not more than @xmath69 .",
    "electron capture on free protons and heavy nuclei during collapse reduces @xmath4 ( i.e. , `` deleptonizes '' the collapsing core ) and consequently decreases the size of the homologously collapsing inner core that depends on the average value of @xmath4 in a roughly quadratic way ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the material of the inner core is in sonic contact and determines the dynamics and the gravitational wave signal at core bounce and in the early postbounce phases .",
    "hence , deleptonization has a direct influence on the collapse dynamics and the gravitational wave signal , and thus it is essential to include deleptonization during collapse .    since multi - dimensional radiation - hydrodynamics calculations in general relativity are not yet computationally feasible , in our simulations we make use of a recently proposed approximative scheme  @xcite where deleptonization is parametrized based on data from detailed spherically symmetric calculations with boltzmann neutrino transport , for which ( as in  @xcite ) we take the latest available electron capture rates  @xcite .",

    "the peak of the waveform spectrum , however , shifts to higher frequencies in the case of a softer eos . for the models considered here ,",
    "this frequency shift amounts to @xmath695 on average for models undergoing pressure - dominated bounce .",
    "it is significantly smaller for models bouncing at subnuclear densities under the influence of centrifugal effects .",
    "if situated within our galaxy , a large fraction of our models are comfortably detectable by current gravitational wave detectors with a signal - to - noise ratio of up to 6 in the most optimistic case ( which is obtained for the most rapidly rotating models that still undergo pressure - dominated core bounce ) .",
    "advanced detectors could observe them easily out to @xmath696 and up to several @xmath697 for third - generation detectors .",
    "while such a gravitational wave signal may per se be detectable , the extraction of detailed physical information from the signal ( i.e. , solving the `` inversion problem '' ) from the signal will be a formidable task .",
    "the very generic morphology of the burst waveforms and the clustering in frequency space of most models make it seem unlikely that a pure waveform - template - based inversion ( as , e.g. , carried out in  @xcite using the waveforms of  @xcite ) can be successful for determining key physical parameters to significant precision .",
    "our results , however , suggest that based on @xmath260 and the peak frequency @xmath592 of the waveform spectrum alone , it should be possible to discriminate between purely pressure - dominated bounce ( small to large @xmath260 at frequencies @xmath592 significantly above @xmath698 ) and centrifugal bounce ( large @xmath260 at frequencies @xmath592 significantly below @xmath698 ) . furthermore , we find that for not too rapid rotation @xmath260 can be directly used to extract the rotation rate @xmath261 at bounce to good precision .",
    "making use of the extensive set of postbounce rotational configurations obtained with our simulations , we have also studied the prospects for the development of nonaxisymmetric rotational instabilities in nascent proto - neutron stars .",
    "we find that the rotational barrier imposed by centrifugal forces prohibits the spin - up to rotation rates necessary for the classical dynamical bar - mode instability at high values of @xmath83 .",
    "we find , however , that a large subset of our postbounce models exhibits sufficiently differential and rapid rotation to become subject to the recently discovered low-@xmath83 instability .",
    "still , three - dimensional simulations as in  @xcite will be necessary to provide conclusive tests of our predictions .",
    "furthermore , the interaction and competition of the low-@xmath83 instability and other instabilities operating on the shear energy of differential rotation , for instance the magneto - rotational instability ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , remain to be studied .",
    "finally , we point out that this study may be regarded as part  with the presently highest level of sophistication  of a multi - decade effort of our groups  @xcite to provide reliable estimates for the gravitational wave burst emission associated with rotating core collapse and core bounce .",
    "the waveforms presented here are for the first time not only accurate ( i.e. , numerically converged ) , but reliable and robust , since our calculations take into account all the necessary physics , including general relativity , deleptonization and a microphysical eos .",
    "all waveforms are available for download in various formats in a publicly accessible waveform catalog  @xcite .",
    "we point out that the gravitational wave emission process considered in this work operates at measurable strength only if the progenitor core is rotating a lot more rapidly than expected for ordinary iron cores ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in slowly rotating core - collapse supernovae ,",
    "turbulent convective overturn , instabilities of the accretion shock , and , possibly , proto - neutron star pulsations are likely to be the dominant emission processes of gravitational waves . the characteristics of these emission processes are not as well understood and will require more extensive and precise modeling to provide accurate estimates of the complete gravitational wave signature of core - collapse supernovae .    it is a pleasure to thank shizuka akiyama , david arnett , adam burrows , luc dessart , pablo cerd - durn , ian hawke , alex heger , ewald mller , shangli ou , jos pons , erik schnetter , ed seidel , bernard schutz , todd thompson , joel tohline , and burkhard zink for helpful comments and inspiring discussions .",

    "<S> we present results from detailed general relativistic simulations of stellar core collapse to a proto - neutron star , using two different microphysical nonzero - temperature nuclear equations of state as well as an approximate description of deleptonization during the collapse phase . investigating a wide variety of rotation rates and profiles as well as masses of the progenitor stars and both equations of state , we confirm in this very general setup the recent finding that a generic gravitational wave burst signal is associated with core bounce , already known as type  i in the literature . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that it is still possible to constrain the progenitor and postbounce rotation based on a combination of the maximum signal amplitude and the peak frequency of the emitted gravitational wave burst . </S>",
    "<S> our models include to sufficient accuracy the currently known necessary physics for the collapse and bounce phase of core - collapse supernovae , yielding accurate and reliable gravitational wave signal templates for gravitational wave data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we assess the possiblity of nonaxisymmetric instabilities in rotating nascent proto - neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong evidence that in an iron core - collapse event the postbounce core can not reach sufficiently rapid rotation to become subject to a classical bar - mode instability . </S>",
