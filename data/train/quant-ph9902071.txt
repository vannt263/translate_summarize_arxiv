    "the problem of how the classical macroscopic world emerges from the quantum substrate is an important point in the interpretation of quantum mechanics and it is still the subject of an intense debate @xcite .",
    "this problem is well illustrated by the possibility , opened by quantum mechanics , of having linear superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable states , the so - called `` schrdinger cat '' states .",
    "an explanation of why we never observe these paradoxical states is proposed by the _ decoherence _ models , i.e. , the rapid transformation of these linear superpositions into the corresponding classical statistical mixture , caused by the unavoidable entanglement of the system with uncontrolled degrees of freedom of the environment @xcite .",
    "the decoherence time depends on the form of system - environment interaction @xcite but , in most cases , it is inversely proportional to the squared `` distance '' between the two states of the superposition @xcite . for macroscopically distinguishable states ,",
    "the decoherence process becomes thus practically instantaneous @xcite .",
    "decoherence is experimentally accessible only in the _ mesoscopic _ domain . in this case , one is able to monitor the progressive emergence of classical properties from the quantum ones .",
    "a first important achievement has been obtained by monroe _",
    "@xcite , who prepared a trapped @xmath0 ion in a superposition of spatially separated coherent states and detected the quantum coherence between the two localized states .",
    "however , the decoherence of the superposition state has not been studied in this experiment .",
    "the progressive decoherence of a mesoscopic schrdinger cat has been observed for the first time in the experiment of brune _",
    "et al_. @xcite , where the linear superposition of two coherent states of the electromagnetic field in a cavity with classically distinct phases has been generated and detected .    with the impressive development of quantum information theory in the last years @xcite",
    ", the study of decoherence has become important not only from a fundamental , but also from a more practical point of view .",
    "all the quantum information processing applications rely on the possibility of performing unitary transformations on a system of @xmath1 quantum bits , whose decoherence has to be made as small as possible .",
    "for this reason , decoherence control is now a rapidly expanding field of investigation . in this respect ,",
    "quantum error correction codes @xcite have been developed in which the entangled superposition state of @xmath1 qubits is `` encoded '' in a larger number of qubits .",
    "assuming that only a fraction of qubits decoheres , it is then possible to reconstruct the original state with a suitable decoding procedure , provided that errors affect different qubits independently",
    ". these codes always require the entanglement of a large number of qubits , and will become practical only if quantum networks of tens of qubits become available . up to now , the polarization states of three photons have been entangled at most @xcite .",
    "entangled states of two rydberg atoms @xcite or of two trapped ions @xcite at most can be generated .",
    "therefore , in the present experimental situation , it is more realistic to study complementary and more `` physical '' ways to harness decoherence , based on the knowledge of the specific process causing decoherence , which could be applied with very few degrees of freedom .",
    "this is possible , in particular , in quantum optics , when information is encoded in the quantum states of an electromagnetic mode ( see for example @xcite ) . in this case",
    "decoherence is caused by photon leakage .",
    "it could therefore be possible to develop experimental schemes able to face photon leakage and the associated decoherence .",
    "a series of papers @xcite have shown that a possible way to control decoherence in optical cavities is given by appropriately designed feedback schemes . refs .",
    "@xcite show that a feedback scheme based on the continuous homodyne measurement of an optical cavity mode is able to increase the decoherence time of a schrdinger cat state . in ref .",
    "@xcite a feedback scheme based on continuous photodetection and the injection of appropriately prepared atoms has been considered .",
    "this scheme , in the limit of very good detection efficiency , is able to obtain a significant `` protection '' of a generic quantum state in a cavity . in @xcite",
    "this photodetection - mediated scheme has been adapted to the microwave experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite in which photodetectors can not be used .",
    "the cavity state can only be indirectly inferred from measurements performed on probe atoms which have interacted with the cavity mode . under ideal conditions , this adaptation to",
    "the microwave cavity case leads to a significant increase of the lifetime of the schrdinger cat generated in @xcite .",
    "it suffers however from two important limitations , making it very inefficient when applied under the actual experimental situation .",
    "it first requires the preparation of samples containing _ exactly _ one rydberg atom sent through the apparatus . up to now , the experimental techniques allow only to prepare a sample containing a random atom number , with a poisson statistics .",
    "two - atom events are excluded only at the expense of a low average atom number , lengthening the feedback loop cycletime @xcite .",
    "the original scheme requires also a near unity atomic detection efficiency , which is extremely difficult to achieve even with the foreseeable improvements of the experimental apparatus .    in this paper",
    "we present a significant improvement of the microwave feedback scheme described in @xcite . this new version , using a direct transmission of the quantum information from the probe to the feedback atom , does not require a large detection efficiency , removing one of the main difficulties of the previous design .",
    "it however also requires sub - poissonian atom statistics .",
    "we show briefly how such atomic packets could be in principle prepared with standard laser techniques .",
    "finally , our scheme improves the efficiency of the feedback photon injection in the cavity by using an adiabatic rapid passage .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the feedback scheme of @xcite is reviewed and critically discussed ; in section iii the modifications of this scheme are introduced and in section iv the map describing the feedback cycle is derived . in section",
    "v the dynamics in the presence of feedback is studied and the protection capabilities of the new proposal are illustrated , while section vi is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us briefly review the original `` stroboscopic '' feedback scheme for microwave cavities proposed in @xcite .",
    "this proposal is based on a very simple idea : whenever the cavity looses a photon , a feedback loop supplies the cavity mode with another photon , through the injection of an appropriately prepared atom .",
    "however , since there are no good enough photodetectors for microwaves , one has to find an indirect way to check if the high - q microwave cavity has lost a photon or not . in the experiment of brune _",
    "@xcite , information on the cavity field state is obtained by detecting the state of a circular rydberg atom which has dispersively interacted with the superconducting microwave cavity .",
    "this provides an  instantaneous \" measurement of the cavity field and suggests that continuous photodetection can be replaced by a series of _ repeated _ measurements , performed by non ",
    "resonant atoms regularly crossing the high - q cavity , separated by a time interval @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental scheme of the stroboscopic feedback loop is a simple modification of the scheme employed in ref .",
    "the relevant levels of the velocity - selected atoms are two adjacent circular rydberg states with principal quantum numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ) and a very long lifetime ( @xmath7 ms ) .",
    "the high - q superconducting cavity is sandwiched between two low - q cavities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in which classical microwave fields resonant with the transition between @xmath6 and @xmath5 can be applied .",
    "the high - q cavity @xmath10 is instead slightly off - resonance with respect to the @xmath11 transition , with a detuning @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the cavity mode frequency and @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the atom - microwave cavity mode system is the usual jaynes - cummings hamiltonian , given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vacuum rabi coupling between the atomic dipole on the @xmath11 transition and the cavity mode . in the off - resonant case and perturbative limit @xmath17",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ jc ] ) ( under an appropriate redefinition of level phases ) assumes the dispersive form @xcite @xmath18    the schrdinger cat state is generated when the cavity mode is initially in a coherent state @xmath19 and the rydberg atom , which is initially prepared in the state @xmath20 , is subjected to a @xmath21 pulse both in @xmath8 and in @xmath9 . in fact , when the atom has left the cavity @xmath9 , the joint state of the atom - cavity system becomes the entangled state @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the interaction time in @xmath10 .",
    "a cat state , i.e. a linear superposition of two coherent states with different phases , is then conditionally generated in the microwave cavity as soon as one of the two circular atomic states is detected .    as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the stroboscopic feedback scheme works only for schrdinger cat states with a definite parity , i.e. even or odd cat states , and therefore we shall restrict to @xmath25 from now on .",
    "in fact , when the cavity field initial state is a generic density matrix @xmath26 , the state of the probe atom - field system after the two @xmath21 pulses and the @xmath27 conditional phase - shift can be written as @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the projections of the cavity field state onto the subspace with an odd and even number of photons , respectively , and the operators @xmath30 ( whose expression is not relevant here ) are given in @xcite .",
    "( [ 2at3 ] ) shows that there is a perfect correlation between the atomic state and the cavity field parity , which is the first step in an optimal quantum non demolition measurement of the photon number @xcite .",
    "it is possible to prove that this perfect correlation between the atomic state and a cavity mode property holds only in the case of an exact @xmath27-phase shift sandwiched by two classical @xmath21 pulses in cavities @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the entangled state of eq .",
    "( [ 2at3 ] ) allows to understand how it is possible to check if the microwave cavity @xmath10 has lost a photon or not and therefore to trigger the feedback loop , using atomic state detection only .",
    "the detection of @xmath31 or @xmath32 determines the parity of the field and , provided that the probe atomic pulses are frequent enough , indicates whether a microwave photon has left @xmath10 or not .",
    "in fact , let us consider for example the case in which an odd cat state is generated ( first atom detected in @xmath31 ) : a probe atom detected in state @xmath31 means that the cavity field has remained in the odd subspace .",
    "the cavity has therefore lost an _ even _ number of photons . if the time interval @xmath2 between the two atomic pulses is much smaller than the cavity decay time @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the probability of loosing two or more photons is negligible and this detection of the probe atom in @xmath31 means that no photon has leaked out from the high - q cavity @xmath10 . on the contrary , when the probe atom is detected in @xmath32 , the cavity mode state is projected into the even subspace .",
    "the cavity has then lost an _",
    "odd _ number of photons .",
    "again , in the limit of enough closely spaced sequence of probe atoms , @xmath34 , the probability of loosing three or more photons is negligible .",
    "a detection in @xmath32 means that one photon has exited the cavity .",
    "therefore , for achieving a good protection of the initial odd cat state , the feedback loop has to supply the superconducting cavity with a photon whenever the probe atom is detected in @xmath32 , while feedback must not act when the atom is detected in the @xmath31 state .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been proposed to realize this feedback loop with a switch connecting the @xmath32 state field - ionization detector with a second atomic injector , sending an atom in the excited state @xmath31 into the high - q cavity .",
    "the feedback atom is put in resonance with the cavity mode by another switch turning on an electric field in the cavity @xmath10 when the atom enters it , so that the level @xmath31 is stark - shifted into resonance with the cavity mode .    as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the probe atomic pulses are sufficiently frequent , this stroboscopic feedback scheme becomes extremely efficient and one gets a good preservation of an initial schrdinger cat state .",
    "however , if we consider the adaptation of this scheme to the present experimental apparatus of ref .",
    "@xcite , we see that it suffers from two main limitations , which significantly decrease its efficiency .",
    "first of all the scheme is limited by the non - unit efficiency of the atomic state detectors ( @xmath35 ) , since the feedback loop is triggered only when the @xmath32-detector clicks .",
    "most importantly , the above scheme assumes one has perfect `` atomic guns '' , i.e. the possibility of having probe and feedback atomic pulses with _ exactly one atom_. this is not experimentally achieved up to now .",
    "the actual experiment @xcite has been performed using atomic pulses with a probability of having exactly one atom @xmath36 , close to the mean atom number in the sample .",
    "this low mean atom number has been chosen to minimize two  atom events .",
    "in this experimental situation , the proposed stroboscopic feedback scheme would have an effective efficiency @xmath37 , too low to get an appreciable protection of the schrdinger cat state .",
    "we show here how this scheme may be improved and adapted to the experimental apparatus employed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the limitations due to the non - unit efficiency of the atomic detectors could be avoided if we eliminate the measurement step in the feedback loop and replace it with an `` automatized '' mechanism preparing the correct feedback atom whenever needed .",
    "this mechanism can be provided by an appropriate conditional quantum dynamics .",
    "we need a  controlled - not \" gate between the probe atom and the feedback atom , because the feedback atom has to remain in an `` off''state if the probe atom exits the cavity of interest @xmath10 in the @xmath31 state , while the feedback atom has to be in the excited state @xmath31 when the probe atom leaves @xmath10 in the @xmath32 state ( we are still assuming the initial generation of an odd cat state ) .",
    "this conditional dynamics can be provided by a second high - q microwave cavity @xmath38 , similar to @xmath10 , replacing the atomic detectors , crossed by the probe atom first and by the feedback atom soon later . a schematic description of the new feedback scheme , with the second cavity @xmath38 replacing the atomic state detectors is given by fig .  [ appa ] .",
    "the cavity @xmath38 is resonant with the transition between an auxiliary circular state @xmath39 , which can be taken as the immediately lower circular rydberg state @xmath40 , and level @xmath32 .",
    "the interaction times have to be set so that both the probe and the feedback atom experience a @xmath41 pulse when they cross the empty cavity @xmath38 in state @xmath32 ( or when they enter in state @xmath39 with one photon in @xmath38 ) .",
    "this interaction copies the state of the probe atom onto the cavity mode and back onto the feedback atom .",
    "@xmath38 acts thus as a `` quantum memory '' @xcite , transferring directly the quantum information between the two atoms without need of a detection .",
    "this removes thus any need for a unit detection efficiency .",
    "this fine tuning of the interaction times to achieve the @xmath41spontaneous emission pulse condition can be obtained applying through the superconducting mirrors of @xmath38 appropriately shaped stark - shift electric fields which puts the atoms in resonance with the cavity mode in @xmath38 only for the desired time . in this way , since @xmath38 is initially in the vacuum state , one has @xmath42 when the probe atom crosses @xmath38 ; soon later a feedback atom enters @xmath38 in the state @xmath43 and one has @xmath44 ( the cavity has a very high q and therefore the probability of photon leakage in the meanwhile is negligible ) . in this way the cavity @xmath38 is always left disentangled in the vacuum state .",
    "the feedback atom exiting @xmath38 in @xmath45 can be promoted to @xmath20 before entering @xmath10 , as required by the feedback scheme , by subjecting it to a @xmath41 pulse in the classical cavity @xmath9 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the conditional dynamics provided by @xmath38 eliminates any limitation associated to the measurement and leads to an `` automatic feedback '' scheme with unit efficiency in principle .    as mentioned above",
    ", an important limitation of the stroboscopic feedback scheme of @xcite is that it requires exactly one probe and one feedback atom per loop .",
    "this condition is still needed in the new scheme with the cavity @xmath38 replacing the atomic detectors . with two or more probe atoms simultaneously in @xmath10 and in @xmath38 , one gets a wrong phase shift for the field in @xmath10 and also an incomplete excitation transfer from the probe atom to the field in @xmath38 .",
    "the same condition holds for the feedback atoms . with two or more feedback atoms in the sample , the excitation transfers in @xmath38 and @xmath10 are incomplete .",
    "a better control of the atom number , providing single atom events with a high probability , could be achieved by a modification of the rydberg atoms preparation techniques .",
    "we outline here briefly the method , which could be implemented in a future version of the experimental set  up .",
    "the rydberg atoms preparation would start from a very low  intensity velocity  selected rubidium atomic beam .",
    "the ground state atom density is so low that the average distance between the atoms in the beam is of the order of a few millimeters .",
    "it means that a section of the beam a few millimeters long contains on the average only one atom ( with a poisson statistics ) .",
    "this section could be driven by a laser resonant on the 5s to 5p transition ( see fig .",
    "[ levels ] for a schematic diagram of the relevant @xmath46rb energy levels involved ) .",
    "the fluorescence signal should make it possible to distinguish easily the situations where the probed section of the beam contains zero , one , two or more atoms , implementing an _ atom counter_. when the section contains zero , two or more atoms , it is discarded .",
    "the system waits then for a time @xmath2 ( a few microseconds to twenty microseconds , depending upon the atomic velocity and the precise length of the atomic beam section ) until a fresh section of the beam comes in the probe laser beam . at variance ,",
    "if the fluorescence level corresponds to exactly one atom , the circular state preparation is started . using only adiabatic rapid passages",
    ", it should be possible to promote the single ground state atom to the desired circular state with a high probability .",
    "the circular state preparation @xcite proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , a laser excitation of an  ordinary \" rydberg state , then a transfer to the circular state .",
    "the latter step already uses adiabatic rapid passages and has a very high efficiency . the former step could also be adiabatic , by using higher laser powers readily available .    instead of preparing a random atom number at a given time ,",
    "one thus prepares with a high probability a single rydberg atom after a random delay ( since the preparation step is triggered only when the atomic counter gives a count of exactly one ) .",
    "the average value of this random delay is minimal when the probability to have exactly one atom is maximized . with a poissonian statistics , the optimal mean",
    "number of atoms in the probed section is 1 .",
    "the average random delay could be of the order of 25 @xmath47s in realistic experimental conditions .",
    "this is short enough at the scale of the cavity field lifetime to play no major role in the experiment .",
    "the unavoidable imperfections of the circular state preparation could be easily taken into account by assuming that the sample contains one atom with a probability @xmath48 and no atoms with a probability @xmath49 .",
    "two - atom events are excluded , a considerable improvement compared to other preparation methods .",
    "the timing of the whole experiment should be conditioned to the operation of the atomic counters .",
    "when the cycle starts , the system idles until a probe atom has been counted and prepared in the circular state . after it has crossed @xmath38 , the preparation cycle of the feedback atom",
    "is started .",
    "the system also idles until this atom is counted and prepared in the circular state .",
    "the feedback is complete when this feedback atom has crossed the cavity @xmath10 .",
    "let us now determine the map of a generic feedback cycle , that is , the transformation connecting the states @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the cavity field in @xmath10 soon after the passage of two successive feedback atoms in @xmath10 . from the previous section it is clear that a new cycle begins",
    "only when one is sure to have one probe atom with certainty and therefore one has to wait a random time @xmath52 before the new probe atom enters @xmath10 .",
    "the atomic counter operate with a cycle time @xmath2 . the average number of atoms per probed packet being one , the probability of having exactly one atom is @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the random waiting time can be written as @xmath54 , @xmath55 , where the probability distribution of the discrete random variable @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 the first step of the feedback loop is simply the standard dissipative evolution with damping rate @xmath58 for a random time @xmath59",
    "@xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and where @xmath62 will denote the state after the @xmath39-th step of the cycle .",
    "the second step is determined by the probe atom crossing the cavity @xmath10 and interacting with it via the dispersive hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "since the probe atom has been already prepared in the circular state @xmath31 and it has already crossed the classical cavity @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ appa ] ) , it enters @xmath10 in the state @xmath63 . due to the @xmath21 phase shift ,",
    "the cavity mode in @xmath10 gets entangled with the probe atom and , after the second feedback step , one has @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the cavity mode parity operator .    as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ appa ] , the probe atom flies then from the cavity @xmath10 to the second high - q cavity @xmath38 . during this time of flight one has to consider the effect of standard vacuum damping on the @xmath10 cavity mode and also the effect of the @xmath21 pulse in @xmath9 on the probe atom , yielding @xmath66 note that we shall always neglect the spontaneous decay of the circular levels , since the lifetime of the involved level ( about @xmath67 ms ) is much larger than the mean feedback cycle duration time ( of the order of @xmath68 ms ) .",
    "the two actions do not interfere and therefore , rearranging the terms , one has an expression connected to eq .",

    "the cavity @xmath38 is initially in the vacuum state , and therefore , using the stark tuning mechanism described in the preceding section to determine the effective interaction time @xmath76 , it is possible to impose the @xmath41 pulse condition for @xmath76 @xmath77 so that the conditional dynamics described by eqs .",

[ appa ] ) in their internal ground state , which is decoupled from all the microwave cavities of the experimental arrangement",

    "it would be preferable to have a way to perfectly release the photon in @xmath10 whatever the state of the cavity mode is . as explained in @xcite this possibility is provided by _",
    "adiabatic transfer _",
    ", which can be realized in the present context using a stark shift electric field in @xmath10 able to change adiabatically the atomic frequency @xmath107 through the resonant value @xmath108 .",
    "let us see in more detail how it is possible to use the stark effect to realize the adiabatic transfer of the excitation .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of the jaynes - cummings model ( [ jc ] ) in the interaction picture and with a time - dependent detuning @xmath109 because of the adiabatic time dependence of the atomic frequency @xmath107 , @xmath110 this hamiltonian couples only states within the two - dimensional manifold with @xmath111 excitations spanned by @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where @xmath106 denotes a fock state of the cavity mode .",
    "within this manifold one has the adiabatic eigenvalues @xmath114 and the corresponding adiabatic eigenstates @xmath115|e , n\\rangle + \\omega \\sqrt{n+1}|g , n+1\\rangle \\right\\ } \\;.",

    "the interesting adiabatic eigenstate is @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , if we assume that the detuning @xmath120 is varied adiabatically from a large negative value @xmath121 to a large positive value @xmath122 , with @xmath123 , it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ vadia ] ) that @xmath119 will consequently show the following adiabatic transformation @xmath124 thereby realizing the desired excitation transfer regardless of the cavity mode state , which , in terms of cavity mode density matrices can be written as @xmath125 to be more precise , each adiabatic eigenstate gets its own dynamical phase factor @xmath126 during the adiabatic evolution @xcite and therefore the transformation ( [ trasfe2 ] ) exactly holds only if this dynamical phase factor does not depend on @xmath106 .",
    "assuming a linear sweep of the stark - shift electric field , that is , @xmath127 , for @xmath128 and using eq .",
    "( [ autova ] ) , one has @xmath129 \\;. \\label{fasen}\\ ] ] therefore one has in general a photon number dependent phase - shift ; however in the particular adiabatic transformation we are considering , for which @xmath123 for all the relevant values of @xmath106 , this phase factor can be well approximated , at the lowest order in @xmath130 , by the constant phase factor @xmath131 and therefore eq .  ( [ trasfe2 ] ) holds exactly .",
    "finally we have all the ingredients to determine the last step of the feedback cycle .",
    "one has to consider the transformation ( [ trasfe2 ] ) when the feedback atom is in state @xmath31 , while nothing happens when the feedback atom passes @xmath10 in state @xmath39 and then one has to trace over the feedback atom because it is not observed .",
    "we have therefore the map connecting the state of the @xmath10 cavity mode after two successive cycles , which is @xmath132 a_{k}(t_{0}+q \\tau_{fb})^{\\dagger } \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + e^{-\\gamma ' ( q   \\tau_{fb}+t_{pr}^{cr}+t_{fb}^{cr } ) } a^{\\dagger } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a a^{\\dagger } } } \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_{k}(t_{0}+q \\tau_{fb})\\rho_{g}^{i }   a_{k}(t_{0}+q \\tau_{fb})^{\\dagger } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a a^{\\dagger } } } a\\ ; , \\label{step8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the projected matrices @xmath70 and @xmath71 are obtained from the cavity mode state after the preceding feedback cycle @xmath50 by inserting eqs .",
    "( [ odd ] ) and ( [ even ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ step1 ] ) .    in the determination of the map ( [ step8 ] ) we have assumed that the rydberg state preparation for both probe and feedback atoms has unit efficiency . in a realistic situation",
    ", the circular state preparation will have a non - unit efficiency @xmath133 .",
    "this implies that the feedback map of eq .",
    "( [ step8 ] ) is realized with a probability @xmath134 only .",
    "in fact , when either the probe or feedback atom rydberg state preparation fails , the feedback does not effectively take place , because either the probe or the feedback atom is not in the correct state and the photon transfer in @xmath10 can not take place .",
    "this effect can be taken into account modifying the feedback map of eq .",
    "( [ step8 ] ) in this way @xmath135 where",
    "@xmath136 is the map operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ step8 ] ) and @xmath137 describes the standard dissipation acting during the feedback cycle time @xmath138 .",
    "as we have observed above , the triggering of the feedback cycle only when the atomic counters have counted exactly one probe and one feedback atom makes the time evolution random .",
    "in fact , the feedback cycle map ( [ stepind ] ) we have determined in the preceding section is a random map , that is , it depends upon the two discrete random variables @xmath83 , @xmath56 .",
    "it is evident that if we want to study the dynamics of the microwave mode within @xmath10 , two different strategies are possible to determine the averaged evolution : i ) repeat the experiment many times up to the same , fixed , elapsed time @xmath139 ; ii ) repeat the experiment many times by fixing the number of feedback cycles instead of the elapsed time .",
    "we shall consider this second possibility , in order to better understand the effect of the autofeedback scheme .",
    "in fact , fixing the elapsed time would have meant averaging over experimental runs characterized by _",
    "different _ number of feedback cycles . using eq .",
    "( [ stepind ] ) , we have that in a single run , the state after @xmath1 feedback cycles is @xmath140 in the limit of a very large number of experimental runs , one gets the average cavity mode state @xmath141 where the probability distributions @xmath142 are given by eq .",
    "( [ prol ] ) . since @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145",
    "are independent random variables , it is evident that the average state @xmath146 after @xmath1 feedback cycles can also be written as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the averaged feedback cycle map operator , determining all the dynamics of the microwave mode .",
    "the expression of this operator can be determined using ( [ stepind ] ) , but it is cumbersome and not particularly interesting .",
    "one relevant aspect of this averaged feedback cycle operator is that , since it involves only the even and odd projections @xmath88 and @xmath87 , and the cavity mode state is initially confined within the odd subspace , it never populates the fock subspace without a definite parity , i.e. , @xmath149 , whenever @xmath150 is odd , at all times . in other words",
    ", it is possible to write @xmath151 at any time .",
    "let us finally discuss the optimal values of the various experimental parameters involved .",
    "it is evident that the protection capabilities of the proposed scheme essentially depend upon the ratio between the mean feedback cycle time @xmath152 and the schrdinger cat decoherence time @xmath153 . for smaller and smaller values of this ratio ,",
    "one gets a longer and longer protection of the initially generated cat state .",
    "this average cycle time @xmath152 is determined by the spatial dimensions of the apparatus ( which can not be too miniaturized since we are using microwaves ) and by the probe and feedback atom velocities , which have to be therefore as large as possible . however , the probe atom velocity is fixed by the @xmath21 phase shift condition which is needed to have a cat state with a definite parity , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the effective transverse length of the @xmath10 cavity mode . in the actual experimental situation",
    "@xmath156 khz , @xmath157 cm and the smallest possible value of the detuning , compatible with the non - resonant interaction , is @xmath158 khz , so that we get @xmath159 m / s .",
    "there is no similar constraint for the feedback atom which can be taken therefore as fast as possible ; we choose @xmath160 m / s , since the rydberg atoms used are thermal rb atoms and this velocity corresponds to the fastest usable part of the maxwellian distribution .",
    "once we have chosen the two atom velocities , one has to check that these values are compatible with the @xmath41 pulse condition of eq .",
    "( [ pipul ] ) for both probe and feedback atom in @xmath38 and also with the conditions for adiabatic transfer for the feedback atom in @xmath10 .",
    "in fact it is possible to use the stark tuning mechanism to determine the interaction times in @xmath38 satisfying the @xmath41 pulse condition only if the cavity crossing time @xmath161 in @xmath38 is _ larger _ than @xmath162 [ see eq .",
    "( [ pipul ] ) ] .",
    "since the cavities @xmath10 and @xmath38 are resonant with the two adjacent transitions @xmath163 and @xmath164 , they can be assumed to be of similar design , so that @xmath165 khz and @xmath166 cm and this implies @xmath167 @xmath47sec , @xmath168 @xmath47sec which are in fact larger than @xmath169 @xmath47sec .",
    "the condition for the adiabatic passage of the feedback atom in @xmath10 is instead that the feedback atom crossing time in @xmath10 @xmath168 @xmath47sec has to be larger than @xmath170 @xmath47sec and therefore this condition is verified too .",
    "the probe and feedback atom velocities determine the overall time of flight @xmath102 of eq .",
    "( [ step7 ] ) ; in fact a reasonable estimate of the apparatus length from @xmath10 to @xmath38 is @xmath97 cm and therefore one has @xmath171 @xmath47sec .",
    "however , the duration time of a feedback cycle is determined not only by @xmath102 , but also by the random waiting times @xmath172 and @xmath92 due to the atomic counters and also by the non - unit efficiency of the rydberg state preparation @xmath48 which we can assume to be @xmath173 . in fact the probe and feedback atoms are prepared in the correct circular rydberg state with a probability @xmath134 and therefore the photon is effectively released into the cavity @xmath10 only after a random number of cycles @xmath174 , with probability @xmath175 , @xmath176 . as a consequence , the effective mean duration time of a feedback cycle , that is , the mean time between two successful photon transfers in @xmath10 , is given by the mean loop time multiplied by the mean number of `` attempts '' , @xmath177 , @xmath178 \\;.      \\label{meanci}\\ ] ]    the sampling time of the probe and feedback atomic counters @xmath2 and @xmath80 corresponds to a probed section of the beam of the order of few millimeters and therefore we can assume @xmath179 @xmath47sec , so that we have @xmath180 @xmath47sec .",
    "this mean duration time has to be smaller than the decoherence time of the schrdinger cat state initially generated , otherwise the correction of the autofeedback scheme would be too late to get a significant protection .",
    "however , from the above discussion it is evident that the experimental conditions put many constraints on the possible parameter values and that this value for @xmath152 can not be significantly decreased .",
    "therefore the only way to achieve a significant schrdinger cat state preservation is to increase the decoherence time , i.e. , increase the relaxation time @xmath181 of the cavity @xmath10 or decrease the cat state initial mean photon number @xmath182 .",
    "in fact we can say that a cat state @xmath183 is protected by the present autofeedback scheme as long as @xmath184 alternatively , if we consider a given mesoscopic value for @xmath185 , as for example @xmath186 as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one begins to increase the `` lifetime '' of the generated cat state as long as @xmath187 ms .",
    "relaxation times of this order of magnitude will be hopefully obtained in the near future and for this reason we have plotted in fig .",
    "2 the wigner functions and the density matrices describing the averaged time evolution in the presence of the autofeedback scheme for an initial odd cat state with @xmath188 and for a cavity relaxation time @xmath189 ms . the cavity @xmath38 is assumed to be equal to @xmath10 and the values of all the other parameters are the same as discussed above , so that @xmath190 .",
    "2(a ) shows the wigner function and the density matrix elements of the initial odd cat state ; fig .",

    "2(c ) refers to the state of the cavity mode after @xmath193 feedback cycles , corresponding to a mean elapsed time @xmath194 .",
    "this figures show the impressive preservation of all the main aspects of the initial odd cat state up to 13 decoherence times . to better appreciate the performance of the proposed scheme we show in fig .  3 the corresponding time evolution of the same initial odd cat state in the absence of the autofeedback scheme .",
    "3(a ) shows again the initial wigner function and density matrix , fig .",
    "3(b ) refers to the cavity field state after one relaxation time @xmath195 and fig .",
    "3(c ) describes the cavity field state after two relaxation times ( in absence of feedback time evolution is no more random and therefore these are actual elapsed times ) . in this case , after one relaxation time , the cat state has already turned into a statistical mixture of two coherent states , with no quantum aspect left , and it approaches the vacuum state after two relaxation times [ fig .",
    "3(c ) ] .    another important aspect of the feedback - induced dynamics shown by fig .",
    "2 is the `` distortion''of the cat state which becomes more and more `` rounded '' as time passes .",
    "this is due to the slow unconventional phase diffusion associated to this feedback scheme and which has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "in fact the present autofeedback scheme is an improvement of the original scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the main physical aspects are essentially the same : the fed back photon has no phase relationship with the photons already present in @xmath10 and this leads to the above mentioned phase diffusion .",
    "this phase diffusion turns out to be very slow ; in fact the present model is essentially a stroboscopic version of the continuous photodetection feedback scheme studied in @xcite , which is characterized in the semiclassical limit by a diffusion term @xmath196\\right ]   \\leftrightarrow \\frac{\\gamma}{8 \\bar{n}}\\frac{\\partial   ^2}{\\partial \\theta ^2 } w(r,\\theta ) \\ ; , \\label{derise2}\\ ] ] for the wigner function in polar coordinates @xmath197 ( @xmath198 is the mean photon number ) and which is analogous to the phase diffusion of a laser well above threshold .",
    "it is possible to see ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the asymptotic state of the cavity mode is the rotationally invariant mixture of the vacuum and the one photon state @xmath199 , which is however reached after many relaxation times .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a method to significantly increase the `` lifetime '' of a schrdinger cat state of a microwave cavity mode .",
    "the scheme uses `` probe '' and `` feedback '' atoms and a second high - q microwave cavity to transfer quantum information between these two atoms without need for a detection stage .",
    "this scheme avoids some of the pitfalls of previously published ones .",
    "in particular , its efficiency does not rely on a perfect rydberg atom detection . even though it relies on an efficient preparation of a single atom , this is not critical since standard laser techniques can be used to fulfill this requirement .",
    "we have shown that the method is quite efficient , with realistic orders of magnitude for the experimental parameters .",
    "we have focused on the case of a schrdinger cat state which , thanks to its well characterized quantum features , plays the role of the typical quantum state ; however , as it can be easily expected , most of the techniques presented here could be applied to the case of a generic quantum state of a cavity mode ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this decoherence control scheme is less general than quantum error correction methods because it exploits from the beginning the specific aspects of the physical mechanism inducing decoherence .",
    "however there are similarities between the present autofeedback scheme and quantum error correction codes . the second cavity @xmath38 detects the error syndrome during its interaction with the probe atom and sends the necessary correction to @xmath10 via the feedback atom .",
    "after the first experimental evidences of decoherence mechanisms , decoherence control is bound to be a rapidly expanding field in quantum physics .",
    "first , it is important as an illustration of a very fundamental relaxation process",
    ". it would be extremely interesting to tailor decoherence , as spontaneous emission in the past .",
    "this should lead to a deeper insight into relaxation theory and into the border between the microscopic and the macroscopic world .",
    "decoherence control is also important for quantum information processing schemes , since decoherence is the main problem to manipulate large quantum systems .",
    "an experimental realization of this feedback scheme , which is quite realistic , would be an important step in this direction .",
