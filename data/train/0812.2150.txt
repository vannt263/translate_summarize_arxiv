    "recent deep observations of polarized radio - continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths of edge - on spiral galaxies @xcite revealed characteristic x - shaped magnetic field structure .",
    "many galaxies showed magnetic field oriented in the halo at a large angle to the galaxy disk .",
    "earlier observations , mostly limited by sensitivity to narrow area along the major axis , demonstrated mainly plane - parallel component ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the polarization vectors of ngc  5775 close to the galactic plane are parallel to the disk , but in the halo they extend up to 10  kpc above the disk forming so called @xmath0-shaped structure in all four quadrants .",
    "such picture most probably reflects the quadrupole configuration of magnetic field in ngc  5775 @xcite .",
    "the observed degree of polarization is very high ( locally reaching even up to 50% ) .",
    "it resembles high regularity of magnetic field there .",
    "such structures seem to be common among edge - on spiral galaxies ( ngc  5775 , ngc  4666 , ngc  4217 ngc  3628 , ngc  253 , ngc  891 , ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , @xcite detected that ngc  5775 shows differential rotation in the direction perpendicular to the disk .",
    "so far , there is no physical explanation for those extended structures .",
    "an attempt to explain the structure of polarized vectors by the dipolar dynamo wave in the ngc  5775 was made by @xcite .",
    "he used a solution of the dipolar classical turbulent dynamo equation and as a result he got structures not confirmed by the observations so far @xcite .",
    "the principle of the action of the cr - driven dynamo @xcite is based on the cosmic ray ( cr ) energy supplied continuously by supernova ( sn ) remnants . due to the anisotropic diffusion of cosmic rays along the horizontal magnetic field lines , cosmic rays tend to accumulate within the disc volume . however , the configuration stratified by the vertical gravity is unstable against the parker instability .",
    "buoyancy effects induce the vertical and horizontal motions of the fluid and the formation of undulatory patterns  magnetic loops in the frozen - in , predominantly horizontal magnetic fields .",
    "the presence of rotation in galactic disks implies a coherent twisting of the loops by means of the coriolis force leading to the generation of the small - scale radial magnetic field components .",
    "the next phase is merging the small - scale loops by the magnetic reconnection process which forms the large scale radial magnetic fields .",
    "finally , the differential rotation stretches the radial magnetic field amplifying the large - scale azimuthal magnetic field .",
    "the coupling of amplification processes of the radial and azimuthal magnetic field components results in exponential growth of the large scale magnetic field with timescales of galactic rotation period ( 140  myr ) as shown by @xcite .    in this paper we present the results of galactic disk modeling which is constructed from a set of local volumes placed at different distances from the galactic center .",
    "we show the results of integration of synchrotron emissivities ( stokes parameters i , q and u ) along the line of sight ( los ) , and compare them to the observed radio images of the galaxy ngc  5775 .",
    "our results are compared to polarized radio continuum observations made at 6 cm @xcite .",
    "the first complete 3d numerical model of the cr - driven dynamo has been demonstrated by @xcite .",

    "the present models gas motions arise only from the cosmic - ray pressure gradients .",
    "we neglect any shock effects , like gas heating .",
    "it is caused by limitations of currently used explicit algorithm for cosmic ray difusion , although we plan to incorporate shock effects in our future papers . a complementary work incorporating affects of dynamo powered directly by supernova - driven turbulence , but without taking into account the cosmic rays , has been recently published by @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we attempt to examine observational properties of our model of cosmic ray - driven dynamo .",
    "the system of coordinates @xmath1 corresponds locally to the global galactic cylindrical system @xmath2 .",

    "the boundary conditions for cosmic rays are fixed ( @xmath3 ) on the z - boundaries .",
    "we present a new set of numerical models of the cr - driven dynamo computed in cubes situated at different distances from the center of the galaxy ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we intend to obtain the picture of the whole galaxy from these local cubes . in the inner part of the galaxy",
    "a variety of different physical mechanisms occur ( such as central activity , bulge influence etc . ) , most of which are not taken into account by our model . for this reason ,",
    "we start our calculations at 2  kpc radius .",
    "the physical parameters used in the calculations are assumed according to the paper of @xcite which refers to the milky way ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "the resolution of our local calculations is given by 25 @xmath20 50 @xmath20 400 grid points .",
    "however , we are primarily interested is in the large scale magnetic field amplification and structure . because cr gas propagates diffusively and gas dynamics does not involve shock waves , the currently assumed grid resolution is sufficient",
    "this statement is verified by resolution studies - simulations performed with the cell size @xmath21 up to @xmath22 lead to convergent results .",

    "as the result of our local calculations we obtained 3d rectangular cubes of the magnetic field and the cosmic - ray energy density .",
    "since the cr component is described as adiabatic relativistic gas instead of the full momentum distribution function , the energy density of cosmic rays can be considered as proportional to the number density of cr nucleons .",
    "the number density of cosmic ray electrons @xmath38 is typically assumed to be of the order of 1  % of the number density of cosmic ray nucleons @xmath39 . therefore @xmath38 can be assumed proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "the local cubes at given radius and chosen time - step are replicated into subsequent cylinders , and cylinders are combined together into the full galactic disk ( at the radii 2  10kpc , and of 8kpc thickness ) .",
    "the synthesized disk can be oriented according to the inclination and position angle of any real galaxy ( in the case of ngc5775 it is 86@xmath41 and 145@xmath41 , respectively ) .",
    "after computing the magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight @xmath42 and relativistic - electron density @xmath38 from the simulation data we calculate the synchrotron emissivity at each point . following the standard formula ( see e.g. * ? ?",

    "we set @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , assuming that the distribution of thermal electrons @xmath48 is proportional to the gas density , we can account for the faraday rotation of polarized emission along the line of sight .",

    "the evolution of the magnetic field energy , the cosmic ray energy and the mean values of the magnetic pitch angles calculated in the subsequent rings for five chosen distances from the galactic center is presented in fig .  [ timedep ] .    in all local models with nonvanishing differential rotation ( @xmath52 ) i.e. at the radii @xmath53 , a fast growth of the total magnetic field energy",

    "the growth time gradually increases with the radius up to about 0.3gyr for the outermost distance from the galactic center @xmath58kpc .",
    "the fastest growth of the magnetic energy at 4.5kpc coincides with the largest sn rate and high shear in comparison with other disk areas . for the smallest radii ( @xmath59kpc ) , with assumed rigid rotation , the magnetic field is not amplified .",
    "this justifies our decision of not taking into consideration rings close to the center of the galaxy .",
    "after the exponential amplification phase the magnetic field energy enters the saturation phase  the earlier , the quicker growth rate was observed .",
    "the fastest growth of the cr energy ( see fig.[timedep ]  middle panel ) is present at the radius 4.5kpc ( solid line ) due to the presence of the highest sn rates there , similarly to the magnetic field energy behavior at this galactocentric distance . in our simulations",
    "we do not obtain the energy equipartition between the cosmic rays and the magnetic field .",
    "the cr energy exceeds the magnetic energy by @xmath60 orders of magnitude .",

    "the bottom graph in fig .  [ timedep ] shows the time evolution of the mean magnetic pitch angles at the same radii as for the magnetic field and the cosmic ray energies . in the beginning stage of evolution ( until 0.2  gyr ) all curves exhibit maxima up to @xmath61 .",
    "then , at two distances from the galactic center , 4.5  kpc and 6  kpc , the values of the mean magnetic pitch angles change sign to the negative ones .",

    ", the cr energy maxima are connected with the largest rate of sn between 4 and 5kpc ( see fig .  [ input ] .    due to small shear in the central part ( see fig .",

    "the smallest or negative pitch angle values are obtained at time 0.5  gyr at the radius 4.5  kpc ( like in fig .",

    "we can conclude that when the dynamo is still under development the pitch angles are low or even negative .",

    "the polarization vectors in the central part of the bodies are parallel to the disk in both modeled and real galaxies .",
    "the extended structures , polarized perpendicularly to the disk plane , are visible in both maps as well . however , in the real ngc  5775 the extensions are separated less than in our model .",
    "the depolarized canals , clearly seen in the model map are barely visible in eastern and western extensions in the real galaxy .",
    "this suggests that in the real galaxy the magnetic field changes its orientation more smoothly than in the model .",

    "narrow depolarized channel is seen on the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "it can be explained by relatively strong faraday effects caused by non - axisymmetric magnetic field configuration present in the front side ( the south - western side ) close to the disk plane @xcite .",
    "another reason for this behavior could be connected to a local enhancement of magnetic field and/or thermal electron density due to the influence of a spiral arm .",
    "our model does not include any non - axisymmetric features .",
    "furthermore we do not include the very central part in our modeled galaxy .",
    "this results in dumping magnetic field at the radii @xmath59kpc . in real galaxies",
    "any non - axial ( vertical ) motions can strongly affect magnetic field configuration .",
    "we compare our model with observations at relatively high frequency ( 4.86ghz ) , where faraday effects usually are small .",
    "nevertheless we include such effects in our calculation of stokes parameters ( eq .",
    "9 ) . calculating model maps of polarized emission ( intensity and directions ) at two frequencies we were able to construct the synthetic maps of rotation measures ( rm ) as well . in the rm calculations we apply the density of gas taken directly from our simulations .",

    "the deviations  most prominent jumps around 6kpc of both sides coincide with the narrow depolarized canals on the polarized intensity map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ]  upper panel ) , where the polarization vectors change their direction rapidly ( that leads to large uncertainties of rm determination ) .",
    "other differences between the model and observations ( in the center and at the peripheries ) are possibly caused by non - axisymmetries in magnetic field and thermal gas distribution ( such as spiral arms ) , certainly present in ngc  5775 and not included in our model .",
    "the extended structures appear in the modelled galaxy as a result of variety of physical processes .",
    "first of all , the buoyancy driven by crs transports the magnetic field together with cr gas to the halo .",
    "we find that the winds in halo build the vertical magnetic component .",
    "those winds reach speeds up to 100km / s ) and form quickly at the beginning stage of ( see * ? ? ?",
    "our local - box simulations show excessive energy density of crs with respect to to the magnetic energy .",
    "possible reasons of this deviation from equipartition are the reduced cr parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients and the assumed horizontal periodicity of the computational domain .",
    "the latter assumption leads to trapping of crs by the horizontal magnetic field .",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    nevertheless , for the first time we apply the modeled cr distribution to perform calculations of the polarized emission in our modeled galaxy .",
    "the obtained results are in large extent in agreement with observations .",
    "the model presented in this paper demonstrates that , even if the modeled disk starts from 2kpc from the center of the galaxy , the magnetic field still can take the form of x - shaped structures in the halo .",
    "the maps of face - on model show that the pitch angles of the polarization vectors are about 5@xmath63 .",
    "this value is a bit smaller than the angles usually observed in the spiral galaxies .",
    "we underline the fact , however , that our model does not take into account effects of spiral arms in the galaxy .",
    "the arms understood as manifestation of density waves are known to influence the magnetic field structure in galactic disks significantly @xcite .",
    "our model calculates polarized intensity only .",
    "it does not include any turbulent structures below relatively large grid size ( 20 , pc ) .",
    "this results in lack of total power emission map comaprable with real observations .",
    "it does not allow any reasonable discussion of depolarization other than caused by beam smoothing and/or faraday effects .",
    "the faraday effects computed in our model does not influence the overall results .",
    "differences between the rotation measure model and observations are certainly due to limitations of axisymmetric model imposed by extending the local - box into the global galactic model .",
    "one could make the final picture more realistic via the incorporation of supernova remnants .",
    "the incorporation of heat output from supernovae may lower the cosmic ray excess .",
    "we suggest that global simulations of cosmic ray - driven dynamo may solve the problem as well , however both mentionned solutions of the cr excess problem require much larger computational resources and other numerical algorithms than those currently available for our project .",
    "it seems however that the large - scale qualitative features , namely the x - type structures can be succesfully reproduced with the present setup .",
    "therefore we would prefer to demonstrate the observational properties of our present incomplete model of cosmic - ray driven dynamo , rather than to mix quantitative solutions with parametrized effects of supernova remnants . in the present simulations with the shearing box approximation ,",
    "it is not yet possible to model the vertical shear presumably taking place in the case of ngc  5775 galaxy @xcite . therefore the global cr - mhd simulations of galactic disks free of limitations of the shearing box should be addressed in the next step of development of our models .",
    "five galaxies ngc  891 , ngc  3628 , ngc  4217 , ngc  4666 , and ngc  5775 out of six shown in @xcite characterized by the x - shaped structures of magnetic field configuration , have flat rotation curve @xcite .",
    "one case ( ngc  4631 ) exhibits different magnetic field orientation with field lines crossing the disk plane .",
    "this galaxy also is different when the rotation curve is taken into consideration .",
    "it rotates rigidly to the large radii @xcite .",
    "the lack of differential rotation favors development of vertical structures at all galactic altitudes and reduces the speed of transformation of the radial component of magnetic field into the azimuthal one @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the peculiar structure of the polarized emission which is observed in ngc  4631 , where vectors cross the disk plane , can result from the cosmic - ray driven dynamo .",
    "this statement is supported by a number of observations @xcite .",
    "the galaxy ngc  4631 drew our attention and we plan to consider it in our future research .",
    "in the present paper we compare the maps of polarized synchrotron radio emission of galaxy ngc  5775 with those constructed from the numerical model of the cosmic ray driven dynamo .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follow :    * all models of the local cosmic - ray driven dynamo computed at the galactic radii between 4kpc and 10kpc indicate the fast growth of the magnetic flux and the total magnetic energy . * the synthetic radio maps of polarized emission computed on the basis of our local models exhibit vertical magnetic field structures similar to those observed in numerous edge - on galaxies . * the polarization vectors in the disk plane ( face - on ) form a spiral pattern with the pitch angles about 5@xmath63 .",
    "the pitch angles from the model are slightly smaller than we normally observe in galaxies .",
    "however , the pitch angle of the mean magnetic field depends to some extent on the actual parameters like e.g. the magnitude of the cr diffusion coefficients . *",
    "as it was expected for observation at relatively high frequencies , the faraday effects considered in our model have no significant importance on the final results . *",
    "the major simplification of our model is caused by assumed axial symmetry , which is necessary for construction of the global model from local - box simulations .",

    "<S> in the present paper we construct maps of polarized synchrotron radio emission of a whole galaxy , based on local models of the cosmic ray ( cr ) driven dynamo . </S>",
    "<S> we perform numerical simulations of the dynamo in local cartesian domains , with shear - periodic boundary conditions , placed at the different galactocentric radii . </S>",
    "<S> those local solutions are concatenated together to construct the synchrotron images of the whole galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the main aim of the paper is to compare the model results with the observed radio continuum emission from nearly edge - on spiral galaxy .    on the basis of the modeled evolution of the magnetic field structure </S>",
    "<S> , the polarization maps can be calculated at different time - steps and at any orientation of the modeled galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time a self - consistent cosmic - ray electron distribution is used to integrate synchrotron emissivity along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our maps are convolved with the given radiotelescope beam . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to reconstruct the extended magnetic halo structures of the edge - on galaxies ( so called x - shaped structures ) . </S>"
