    "a geometric transition between a pair of smooth varieties is the process of deforming the first variety to a singular one and then obtaining the second one by resolving the singularities .",
    "the first variety is called a smoothing and the second one a resolution . in @xcite",
    ", morrison conjectures that , in certain circumstances , mirror symmetry should map a pair of smooth calabi - yau manifolds , related by a geometric transition , to another pair , also related by a geometric transition but with the roles reversed , so that the mirror of a smoothing should be a resolution and viceversa .",
    "this idea is supported by evidences and examples .",
    "morrison also suggests that a new understanding of this phenomenon could come from the syz interpretation of mirror symmetry as a duality of special lagrangian torus fibrations .",
    "building on ideas of hitchin , kontsevich - soibelman and others on the syz conjecture @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , gross and siebert show that mirror pairs of calabi - yau manifolds can be constructed from a legendre dual pair of affine manifolds with singularities and polyhedral decompositions , also called tropical manifolds @xcite . in this article",
    "we consider the special case of conifold transitions .",
    "we introduce the notion of tropical conifold , i.e. of tropical manifold with nodes , and we show that the smoothing / resolution process also has a natural description in this context . indeed the smoothing of a tropical conifold simultaneously induces a resolution of its mirror , but in general the process is obstructed . to study global obstructions we introduce the notion of tropical cycle . in terms of the original calabi - yau varieties , we prove that the existence of tropical cycles containing the nodes implies the simultaneous vanishing of the obstructions to the smoothing of one variety and to the resolution of its mirror .",
    "we conjecture that the existence of such cycles containing the nodes should also allow the resolution / smoothing of the tropical conifold .",
    "this would show that the smoothing and the resolution are themselves mirror pairs in the sense of gross - siebert .",
    "we prove the conjecture for some special configurations of nodes and we apply the results to some interesting examples . in terms of the lagrangian fibrations constructed by the authors @xcite",
    ", these results also determine criteria to establish if and how a lagrangian fibration  survives \" a conifold transition .",
    "a node is the @xmath1-fold singularity with local equation @xmath2 .",
    "a small resolution of a node has a @xmath3 as its exceptional cycle , with normal bundle @xmath4 .",
    "the smoothing of a node ( i.e. @xmath5 ) produces a langrangian @xmath1-sphere as a vanishing cycle .",
    "a conifold transition is the geometric transition associated with a @xmath1-fold with nodal singularities ( i.e. a  conifold \" ) .",
    "it was proved by friedman and tian @xcite , @xcite that a compact complex conifold can be smoothed to a complex manifold if and only if the exceptional cycles of a small resolution satisfy a",
    " good relation \" in homology ( see equation ( [ cx_goodrel ] ) ) . similarly , on the symplectic side , it was shown by smith , thomas and yau @xcite that a  symplectic conifold \" has a symplectic ( small ) resolution , with symplectic exceptional cycles , if and only if the vanishing cycles of a smoothing satisfy a good relation .",
    "these two results are a manifestation of the idea that the mirror of a complex smoothing should be a symplectic resolution .",
    "indeed this idea has been used to find the mirror partner of one of the calabi - yau s involved in a conifold transition from the knowledge of the mirror of the other calabi - yau ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "mirror symmetry is usually computed when the calabi - yau manifold is the generic fibre of a family @xmath6 , where the special fibre @xmath7 is highly degenerate .",
    "more precisely one requires that @xmath8 has maximally unipotent monodromy ( or @xmath8 is what the physicists call a large complex structure limit point ) .",
    "the strominger - yau - zaslow ( syz ) conjecture @xcite claims that mirror calabi - yau pairs @xmath9 and @xmath10 should admit `` dual '' special lagrangian fibrations , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this original idea has been revised by gross - wilson @xcite , @xcite and kontsevich - soibelman @xcite , who claimed that special lagrangian fibrations should exist only in some limiting sense as the fibre @xmath13 approaches the singular fibre @xmath8 ( see also the survey paper @xcite ) .",
    "this  limiting fibration \" can be described in terms of a certain structure on the base @xmath14 of the fibration . here",
    "@xmath14 is a real manifold and the structure on @xmath14 should contain information concerning the complex and symplectic structure of the calabi - yau manifold .",
    "moreover , this data contains intrinsically a duality given by a legendre transform .",
    "the important fact is that the structure on @xmath14 should allow the  reconstruction \" of the original calabi - yau .",
    "this is known as the reconstruction problem .",
    "therefore , finding the mirror of a given family @xmath6 of calabi - yau s becomes the process of constructing @xmath14 , with its structure , applying the legendre transform to obtain the dual base @xmath15 , with dual structure , and then reconstructing the mirror family via some reconstruction theorem .",
    "for instance , in dimension @xmath0 , kontsevich and soibelman @xcite , construct a rigid analytic @xmath16 from an affine structure on @xmath17 with @xmath18 punctures .      in all dimensions ,",
    "this program has been completed by gross and siebert in a sequence of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "on @xmath14 they consider the structure of an integral affine manifold with singularities and polyhedral decompositions .",
    "roughly this means that @xmath14 is obtained by gluing a set of @xmath19-dimensional integral convex polytopes in @xmath20 by identifying faces via integral affine transformations ( this is the polyhedral decomposition , denoted @xmath21 ) .",
    "then , at the vertices @xmath22 of @xmath21 one defines a fan structure , which identifies the tangent wedges of the polytopes meeting at @xmath22 with the cones of a fan @xmath23 in @xmath20 .",
    "there are some additional compatibility conditions required by the fans defined at vertices belonging to a common face of @xmath21 . for a certain codimension @xmath0",
    "closed subset @xmath24 , this structure determines an atlas on @xmath25 such that the transition maps are integral affine transformations ( this is the integral affine structure ) .",
    "the set @xmath26 , called the discriminant locus , is the set of singularities of the affine structure .",
    "an additional crucial piece of data is a polarization , which consists of a so - called  strictly convex multivalued piecewise linear function \" @xmath27 on @xmath14 .",
    "such a @xmath27 is specified by the data of a strictly convex piecewise linear function @xmath28 defined on every fan @xmath23 , plus compatibility conditions between @xmath28 and @xmath29 for vertices @xmath22 and @xmath30 belonging to a common face .",
    "all these data , which we denote by the triple @xmath31 , are also called a polarized tropical manifold .",
    "the  discrete legendre transform \" associates to @xmath31 another triple @xmath32 .",
    "essentially , at a vertex @xmath22 of @xmath14 , the fan @xmath23 and function @xmath28 provide an @xmath19-dimensional polytope @xmath33 , by the standard construction in toric geometry .",
    "two polytopes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , associated to vertices @xmath22 and @xmath30 on a common edge of @xmath21 , can be glued together along a face using the compatibilities between the pairs @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this gives @xmath15 and the polyhedral decomposition @xmath37 .",
    "the fan structure and function @xmath38 at the vertices of @xmath39 come from the @xmath19-dimensional polytopes of @xmath21 essentially using the inverse construction .    in order to have satisfactory reconstruction theorems",
    "it is necessary to put further technical restrictions on @xmath31 .",
    "gross and siebert define such conditions and call them `` positivity and simplicity '' . for convenience , we will say that a polarized tropical manifold is smooth if it satisfies these nice conditions .",
    "in particular , in the @xmath1-dimensional case smoothness of @xmath14 amounts to the fact that @xmath26 is a @xmath1-valent graph and the vertices can be of two types :  positive \" or  negative \" , depending on the local monodromy of the affine structure .",
    "the gross - siebert reconstruction theorem @xcite , ensures that given a smooth polarized tropical manifold @xmath31 , it is possible to construct a toric degeneration @xmath6 of calabi - yau varieties , such that @xmath14 is the dual intersection complex of the singular fibre @xmath8 .",
    "this means that @xmath8 is the union of toric varieties glued along toric divisors .",
    "the toric varieties are precisely those given by the fans @xmath23 .",
    "the compatibility between the fans allow the toric varieties to be glued together to form @xmath8 .",
    "the difficult part in the gross - siebert theorem consists in the reconstruction of the whole family @xmath6 .",
    "the mirror family @xmath40 is obtained by applying the reconstruction theorem to the legendre dual @xmath41 .",
    "gross and siebert give various evidences that this construction coincides with mirror symmetry .",
    "the integral affine structure on @xmath42 implies the existence of a local system @xmath43 , whose fibres @xmath44 are maximal lattices in @xmath45 .",
    "then one can form the @xmath19-torus bundle @xmath46 over @xmath47 .",
    "the standard symplectic form on @xmath48 descends to @xmath49 and the projection @xmath50 is a lagrangian torus fibration . in @xcite",
    ", we proved that if @xmath14 is a @xmath1-dimensional smooth tropical manifold then one can form a symplectic compactification of @xmath49 .",
    "this is a symplectic manifold @xmath51 , containing @xmath49 as a dense open subset , together with a lagrangian fibration @xmath52 which extends @xmath53 .",
    "this is done by inserting suitable singular lagrangian fibres over points of @xmath26 .",
    "topologically the compactification @xmath51 is based on the one found by gross in @xcite .",
    "it is expected that @xmath51 should be diffeomorphic to a smooth fibre @xmath54 of the family @xmath6 in the gross - siebert reconstruction theorem , whose dual intersection complex is @xmath41 .",
    "this result has been announced in @xcite , theorem 0.1 . a complete proof for the quintic @xmath1-fold in @xmath55 is found in @xcite .",
    "we also expect that @xmath51 should be symplectomorphic to @xmath54 with a suitable khler form , although there is no proof of this yet .      in dimension @xmath1 ,",
    "smoothness of @xmath14 ensures that the general fibre @xmath54 of @xmath6 is smooth . in this article",
    "we introduce the notion of ( polarized ) tropical conifold , in which the discriminant locus is allowed to have @xmath56-valent vertices .",
    "such vertices , which we call ( tropical ) nodes , are of two types : negative and positive .",
    "away from these nodes , a tropical conifold is a smooth tropical manifold .",
    "we believe that the gross - siebert reconstruction theorem can be extended also to tropical conifolds , but the general fibre @xmath54 should be a variety with nodes .",
    "this is hinted by the fact that the local conifold @xmath57 has a pair of torus fibrations which induce on the base @xmath14 the same structure as in a neighborhood of positive or negative nodes .",
    "in fact , we show that if @xmath14 is a tropical conifold , then @xmath49 can be topologically compactified to a topological conifold @xmath51 ( i.e. a singular topological manifold with nodal singularities ) .",
    "an interesting observation is that the legendre transform of a positive node is the negative node .",
    "in particular we also have the mirror conifold @xmath58 .",
    "this extends topological mirror symmetry of @xcite to conifolds .",
    "then we give a local description of the smoothing and resolution of a node in a tropical conifold ( see figures [ transition ] and [ transition2 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the legendre dual of a resolution is indeed a smoothing . at the topological level",
    "this was already observed by gross @xcite and ruan @xcite , who also discusses a global example .",
    "the interesting question is global : given a compact tropical conifold , can we simultaneously resolve or smooth its nodes ? we give a precise procedure to do this .",
    "it turns out that the smoothing of nodes in a tropical conifold simultaneously induces the resolution of the nodes in the mirror .",
    "what are the obstructions to the tropical resolution / smoothing ?",
    "for this purpose we define the notion of tropical @xmath0-cycle inside a tropical conifold .",
    "these objects resemble the usual notion of a tropical surface as defined for instance by mikhalkin in @xcite .",
    "a tropical @xmath0-cycle is given by a space @xmath59 and an embedding @xmath60 with some additional structure .",
    "the space @xmath59 has various types of interior and boundary points .",
    "for instance at the generic points , @xmath59 is locally euclidean , at the codimension @xmath61 points @xmath59 is modeled on the tropical line times an interval and at codimension @xmath0 points @xmath59 is modeled on the tropical plane ( see figure [ tdomain ] ) and so on . in theorem [ good_rel_pos ] we prove that if @xmath62 contains tropical nodes , then both the vanishing cycles associated to the nodes in @xmath51 and the exceptional curves associated to the nodes in @xmath58 satisfy a good relation . thus obstructions vanish on both sides of mirror symmetry .",
    "the results of friedman , tian and smith - thomas - yau then lead us to conjecture [ trop_cycle_conj ] , which states that a set of nodes in the tropical conifold @xmath14 can be resolved if and only if it is contained in the union of tropical @xmath0-cycles .",
    "we give a proof of this conjecture for certain special configurations of nodes in theorems [ resolve_nodes_1 ] , [ resolve_nodes_2 ] , [ resolve_-ve_nodes ] and in corollary [ resolve_nodes_cor ] .",
    "we expect that , if unobstructed , then the resolution / smoothing of a set of nodes should give a tropical manifold whose associated gross - siebert family is the resolution / smoothing of the nodes in the family associated with the tropical conifold .",
    "this is true for the topological reconstruction .",
    "finally we apply these results to specific examples .",
    "we consider the case of schoen s calabi - yau @xcite , which is a fibred product of two rational elliptic surfaces .",
    "a corresponding tropical manifold has been described by gross in @xcite .",
    "it is possible to modify the example in many ways so that we obtain a tropical conifold with various nodes .",
    "we show how these nodes can be resolved / smoothed and thus obtain new tropical manifolds .",
    "the interesting fact is that this procedure automatically produces the mirror families via discrete legendre transform and the reconstruction theorems .",
    "we denote the convex hull of a set of points @xmath63 in @xmath20 by @xmath64 . given a set of vectors",
    "@xmath65 the cone spanned by these vectors is the set @xmath66",
    "we give an informal introduction to affine manifolds with singularities and polyhedral decompositions .",

    ", we use the same model for the generic singular fibration .",
    "but since we are working on the tangent bundle one can see that condition @xmath1003 of definition [ tropical_cycle ] implies that the vector field @xmath22 corresponds to the class @xmath318 .",

    "it is clear though that in all such cases the sections used can be interpolated with the aid of usual bump functions .",
    "also , in the cases where the choice of the @xmath337 or @xmath285 fibres are not canonically given as an orbit of an action ( e.g. in the case of a negative node or negative vertex ) , then we can interpolate choices via some isotopy along the edge .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "we point out that our construction of @xmath713 and the fibration @xmath1006 is very similar to the fibration constructed by g. mikhalkin in @xcite of a hypersurface in @xmath1007 over its `` non - archimedean '' amoeba .",
    "we discuss here the problem of simultaneously resolving a set of nodes in a tropical conifold @xmath31 .",
    "more precisely , given a set of nodes in @xmath14 and hence in @xmath51 , the topological conifold associated to @xmath14 , we want to construct a new tropical manifold @xmath594 such that the topological compactification @xmath1008 is homemorphic to the resolution of the corresponding nodes in @xmath51 . to achieve this we need to change the affine structure on @xmath14 so that a neighborhood of the node is replaced by a neighborhood which is ( locally ) affine isomorphic to its tropical resolution described in  [ trop_res_+ve ] and  [ trop_res_-ve ] .",
    "this is not a local problem .",
    "in fact we should expect that in the compact case , this problem has global obstructions . intuitively , resolving",
    "a node implies the insertion of an extra @xmath0-dimensional face ( in the positive case ) or an extra @xmath1-dimensional polytope ( in the negative case ) , causing a modification of nearby polytopes which propagates away from the node .    as we have discussed in  [ trop_res_+ve ] and  [ trop_res_-ve ] , the local resolution of a node can be achieved by smoothing the mirror node and then applying discrete legendre transform .",
    "therefore , the problem of tropically resolving a set of nodes is equivalent to the one of tropically smoothing the mirror ones . in this sense",
    "the phrase `` simultaneously resolving / smoothing a set of nodes '' also means simultaneously resolving the nodes on @xmath14 _ and _ smoothing the mirror nodes on @xmath15 . in theorem [ good_rel_pos ] we have proved that the existence of tropical @xmath0-cycles in @xmath14 containing the nodes guarantees that the topological obstructions to resolve the nodes in @xmath664 and to smooth the mirror ones in @xmath58 vanish simultaneously .",
    "this suggests the idea that the existence of tropical @xmath0-cycles could imply the vanishing of the obstructions to the tropical resolution of nodes .",
    "so , let @xmath1009 be a set of nodes of @xmath15 , where @xmath420 are negative and @xmath1010 are positive .",
    "the negative ones are the barycenters of square @xmath0-dimensional faces @xmath1011 and the positive ones are barycenters of @xmath61-dimensional edges @xmath1012 .",
    "then , to simultaneously smooth these nodes we want to do the following :    * find a refinement @xmath242 of @xmath232 inducing a diagonal subdivision of @xmath1011 and the barycentric subdivision of @xmath1012 ; * define a suitable fan structure , compatible with @xmath242 , at the barycenters of the edges @xmath1012 which has the effect of changing the discriminant locus as in  [ trop_res_-ve ] ; * construct an mpl - function @xmath590 , strictly convex with respect to @xmath596 .",
    "this has to be done so that we obtain a new tropical manifold ( or conifold , if there are other nodes ) @xmath1013 and the corresponding manifold ( or conifold ) @xmath1014 is homeomorphic to the smoothing of @xmath58 at the nodes corresponding to @xmath1009 .",
    "if this can be done , then the mirror @xmath594 of @xmath1013 gives the simultaneous resolution of the mirror nodes .",
    "we remark that in point @xmath251 the subdivision of the edges @xmath1012 does not have to be necessarily barycentric , it may simply be a subdivision given by adding one vertex at an interior integral point . during the process , in order to preserve integrality , it may be necessary to rescale all polytopes by some common factor    [ pos_nodes_rel ] a given set of nodes @xmath420 of a tropical conifold @xmath31 is said to be _ related _ if there exist tropical @xmath0-cycles @xmath1015 such that @xmath1016 contains the nodes @xmath420 and no other nodes .    in view of this definition and theorem  [ good_rel_pos ]",
    "we can conjecture the following    [ trop_cycle_conj ] a set of nodes @xmath420 in a tropical conifold @xmath31 can be simultaneously resolved by the above process if and only if they are related .",
    "although we believe this conjecture to be morally true , we do not exclude that some refinement in our definition of tropical @xmath0-cycle will be necessary . in the following",
    "we prove this conjecture for certain configurations of nodes which are related .",
    "suppose that there is a polytope @xmath1017 of the type @xmath1018 $ ] , where @xmath1019 is a @xmath0-dimensional convex integral polytope in @xmath167 and consider @xmath1020 .",
    "we assume that @xmath834 and that the vertices @xmath420 of @xmath59 are positive nodes .",

    "[ resolve_nodes_1 ] if positive nodes @xmath420 in a tropical conifold @xmath31 are in a configuration as above , then they can be tropically resolved .",
    "we smooth the mirror nodes . first observe that since the positive nodes coincide with the vertices of @xmath59 and @xmath1021 , then @xmath1019 ( and therefore @xmath59 ) must be a delzant polytope .",

    "for instance on the first cone of the list ( [ fan_cj ] ) , we would get @xmath1361 which may not be an integer . similarly on the second cone @xmath1362 .",
    "one can check that if we let @xmath458 be a common multiple of @xmath1321 and @xmath1322 for all @xmath428 , then @xmath588 will be integral .    verifying that @xmath588 is well defined is a tedious calculation similar to the one carried out in theorem [ resolve_nodes_1 ] and we therefore omit it .",
    "also the argument to show that the function @xmath590 defined in ( [ new_function ] ) is strictly convex for large @xmath914 is the same .",
    "we discuss some examples of tropical conifolds where various sets of nodes can be simultaneously resolved / smoothed giving rise to new smooth tropical manifolds . we know that some of these examples are associated to batyrev and borisov s examples of calabi - yau threefolds as complete intersections in toric fano manifolds .",
    "some others probably are not , but we are not sure .      as the set @xmath21 of polytopes we take @xmath1363 copies of a triangular prisms , i.e. of @xmath1364 we divide @xmath21 in two families of nine prisms each and label prisms in each family by @xmath1365 and @xmath1366 respectively , where @xmath1367 are cyclic indices from @xmath61 to @xmath1 .",
    "the vertices of @xmath1368 and @xmath1369 are labeled like in figure  [ prism1 ] .",
    "notice that some polytopes will have vertices with the same label .",
    "we glue polytopes along @xmath0-dimensional faces by matching vertices with the same label .",
    "for instance , figure  [ prism3 ] shows the result of gluing @xmath1370 , @xmath1371 , @xmath1372 .",
    "the result of identifying polytopes with this rule gives two ( polyhedral ) solid tori , one from each family .",
    "now glue the boundaries of these solid tori along @xmath0-dimensional faces by matching the vertex @xmath1373 with the vertex @xmath1374 , for every @xmath1375 .",
    "this gives the manifold @xmath14 , homeomorphic to a @xmath1-sphere , and the polyhedral decomposition @xmath21 .",
    "we now describe the fan structure at vertices .",
    "there are two types of vertices , those labeled @xmath1376 ( or @xmath1377 ) , lying in the interior of the solid tori , and those labeled @xmath1378 ( which are the same as @xmath1379 ) lying on the boundary of the solid tori .",
    "we take as representatives of each type , the vertices @xmath1380 and @xmath1381 respectively , and describe the fan structure there .",
    "vertices of the same type will have the same fan structures , in the obvious sense .",
    "for the vertex @xmath1380 , take the fan corresponding to @xmath1382 , whose three dimensional cones are @xmath1383 @xmath1384 the vertex",
    "@xmath1380 belongs to six @xmath1-dimensional faces of @xmath14 .",
    "three of these are @xmath1385 , which intersect on the edge from @xmath1380 to @xmath1386 .",
    "identify the tangent wedges at @xmath1380 of these three polytopes with the first three cones , in such a way that the the tangent direction to the edge from @xmath1380 to @xmath1386 is mapped to @xmath318 .",
    "the other three @xmath1-dimensional faces containing @xmath1380 are @xmath1387 , which intersect on the edge from @xmath1380 to @xmath1388 .",
    "identify the tangent wedges at @xmath1380 of these three polytopes with the last three cones , in such a way that the tangent direction to the edge from @xmath1380 to @xmath1388 is mapped to @xmath354 .",
    "for the vertex @xmath1381 , take the fan corresponding to @xmath1389 , whose @xmath1-dimensional cones are the octants of @xmath184 .",
    "notice that there are eight @xmath1-dimensional faces containing @xmath1381 : @xmath1390 , @xmath1391 , @xmath1392 , @xmath1393 , @xmath1394 , @xmath1395 , @xmath1396 and @xmath1397 .",
    "the fan structure at @xmath1381 identifies the tangent wedges of these eight polytopes respectively with : @xmath1398 , @xmath1399 , @xmath1400 , @xmath1401 , @xmath1402 , @xmath1403 ,  @xmath1404 and @xmath1405 .",
    "this determines the fan structure in the neighborhood of @xmath1381 and similarly for each vertex of the same type .",
    "the discriminant locus @xmath26 , also depicted in figure [ monodromy ] , can be described as follows . inside square faces with vertices @xmath1406 and @xmath1407 ( or @xmath1408 and @xmath1409 ) , @xmath26 consists only of the segment joining the barycenter of the edge from @xmath1410 to @xmath1378 ( resp . from @xmath1377 to @xmath1379 ) to the barycenter of the edge from @xmath1411 to @xmath1407 ( resp . from @xmath1412 to @xmath1409 ) , see figure [ monodromy ] ( a ) .",
    "monodromy around this component of @xmath26 is given by the matrix @xmath1413 observe that all these segments together give six disjoint circles , three in the interior of each solid torus .",
    "moreover each circle has multiplicity @xmath1 , as can be seen from the monodromy .",
    "it can be shown that the structure can be modified slightly so that each circle splits into three , each one with the monodromy of generic - singularities .",
    "we will ignore this issue here .",
    "inside square faces with vertices @xmath1378 , @xmath1414 , @xmath1415 and @xmath1407 , @xmath26 has a quadrivalent vertex ( see figure [ monodromy ] @xmath928 ) . in fact it can be checked that this vertex is a negative node .",
    "overall there are @xmath1416 negative nodes .",
    "there are no other components of @xmath26 .",
    "finally we define a strictly convex piecewise linear function @xmath27 on @xmath662 .",
    "it is enough to specify the function on the fans associated to each vertex . at vertices of type @xmath1376 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1377 ) the fan is the fan of @xmath1382 .",
    "we only need to specify the values of @xmath27 at primitive generators of one dimensional cones .",
    "so we define @xmath27 to have value @xmath61 at @xmath1417 and at @xmath318 , and zero at the remaining ones . at vertices of type @xmath1418 ,",
    "the fan is the fan of @xmath1389 .",
    "here we take @xmath27 to have value @xmath61 at @xmath1419 , @xmath355 and @xmath354 and zero at the remaining ones .",
    "one can check that @xmath31 is a well defined tropical conifold with @xmath1416 negative nodes .",
    "the discrete legendre transform of the previous example gives its mirror @xmath1420 .",
    "the polytopes dual to the vertices @xmath1410 or @xmath1377 are six triangular prisms ( i.e. @xmath1421 ) , which we label @xmath1422 and @xmath1423 respectively .",
    "the polytopes dual to the other @xmath1416 vertices are cubes ( i.e. @xmath1424 ) .",
    "let us denote the nine cubes by @xmath1425 .",
    "we label the vertices of these polytopes by the letters @xmath1426 and @xmath1427 as in figure  [ prism4 ] .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional faces of these polytopes are glued by matching the vertices with the same labeling .",
    "notice that by first gluing together @xmath1428 and @xmath608 on the one hand and @xmath1429 and @xmath1430 on the other , we obtain a pair of solid tori .",
    "then , in figure  [ prism4 ] , the front faces of the cubes @xmath1425 are glued to the square faces of @xmath1422 and the back faces are glued to the square faces of @xmath1423 . the final result is again a @xmath1-sphere .",
    "we now need to specify the fan structure at vertices .",
    "the fan at every vertex is the fan of @xmath1382 . in the fan structure at @xmath1431 the primitive tangent vectors to the five edges going to @xmath1432 , to @xmath1433 , to @xmath1434 , to @xmath1435 and to @xmath1436 are mapped respectively to @xmath173 , @xmath349 , @xmath1437 , @xmath318 and @xmath354 . similarly ( and symmetrically ) we have the fan structure at the vertex @xmath1438 . by inspection one can see that the discriminant locus @xmath26 is as depicted in figure  [ prism4 ] .",
    "in fact monodromy around the edges of @xmath26 contained in the union of the @xmath1422 s ( or in the union of the @xmath1439 s ) is conjugate to ( [ mon1_ex ] ) .",
    "the remaining edges of @xmath26 , those which do not intersect the triangular prisms , have standard generic - singular monodromy . notice that each edge going from @xmath1431 to @xmath1434 contains a positive node .",
    "so that @xmath250 has @xmath1416 positive nodes , which are mirror to the @xmath1416 negative ones in @xmath662 .",
    "we also have a strictly convex piecewise linear function @xmath38 .",
    "we now apply the results of section [ simult_res_sm ] to simultaneously resolve and smooth certain sets of nodes in these two examples . in @xmath15 , let us denote by @xmath1440 the edge from @xmath1431 to @xmath1434 , which contains a positive node . notice that we can cut each cube with the unique plane passing through the four nodes ,",
    "this gives us a tropical @xmath0-cycle @xmath59 containing the nodes .",
    "thus every quadruple of nodes contained in a cube is related in the sense of definition [ pos_nodes_rel ] , moreover they are also in a configuration where we can apply theorem  [ resolve_nodes_1 ] , thus they can be resolved .",
    "in fact any subset of the @xmath1416 nodes which is a union of quadruples of nodes contained in a cube is in a configuration which can be resolved with the criteria of section [ simult_res_sm ] .",
    "for instance if we take the six nodes inside two cubes sharing a common face ( e.g. @xmath1441 and @xmath1442 ) , then these are in a configuration like in theorem  [ resolve_nodes_2 ] .",
    "similarly the seven nodes inside a pair of cubes sharing an edge can be resolved using corollary [ resolve_nodes_cor ] .",
    "we can also resolve all @xmath1416 nodes , by observing that we can find tropical @xmath0-cycles @xmath1443 , @xmath1444 and @xmath1445 which are the squares obtained by cutting the cubes @xmath1446 , @xmath1447 and @xmath1448 .",
    "the pairwise intersection of the @xmath1449 s is just a point , and therefore corollary  [ resolve_nodes_cor ] applies .",
    "the last case is given by @xmath1450 nodes .",
    "these can also be resolved with a slight refinement of the arguments above .",
    "let us now discuss the smoothing of the nodes in @xmath15 . by mirror symmetry",
    ", smoothing nodes corresponds to resolving the mirror ones .",
    "so let us look at @xmath662 .",
    "consider for instance the polytopes @xmath1451 as in figure [ prism3 ] .",
    "then the three square faces of these polytopes which do not contain the vertices @xmath1452 and @xmath1453 have a negative node in their barycenter ( see also figure [ monodromy ] ( b ) ) .",
    "we now construct a tropical @xmath0-cycle containing these three nodes ( see figure [ sim_smooth ] ) . inside the triangular prism",
    "@xmath544 , given by ( [ prismt ] ) , consider the triangle @xmath1454 , obtained by cutting @xmath544 in the middle by a plane parallel to the triangular faces",
    ". then define the tropical @xmath0-cycle @xmath59 as the union of the copies of this triangle contained in @xmath1455 and @xmath1456 . as the vector field @xmath22 of definition [ tropical_cycle ]",
    "we take the parallel transport along @xmath59 of the tangent vector to the edge from @xmath1452 to @xmath1453 .",
    "notice that @xmath1457 consists of the boundary of @xmath59 and three other points in the interior .",
    "it can be easily verified that the latter points satisfy condition @xmath1003 of definition [ tropical_cycle ] .",
    "also all other conditions of definition [ tropical_cycle ] are satisfied . it can be also verified that theorem [ resolve_-ve_nodes ] applies to this configuration .",
    "the same thing can of course be said about the three nodes in the union of @xmath1458 and @xmath1459 .",
    "thus the sets of three nodes in these configurations can be resolved and the corresponding mirror nodes in @xmath15 can be smoothed .",
    "notice that the mirror nodes are those which are in the barycenters of the edges @xmath1460 , @xmath1461 or @xmath1462 ( or @xmath1463 , @xmath1464 or @xmath1465 ) .",
    "inside @xmath14 , let us consider the nine square faces containing the nine nodes .",
    "these form the boundary of the solid torus formed by the polytopes @xmath1366 ( or @xmath1365 ) . represent the boundary as a big square subdivided in nine small ones . then figure [ re_sm ]",
    "represents the various possibilities we have of resolving and smoothing nodes in order to obtain a smooth tropical manifold .",
    "the families of nodes which can be resolved are those which lie on the horizontal or vertical lines of the grid and these are represented by nodes which are circled ( in blue ) .",
    "the nodes which are being smoothed are the ones whose faces are subdivided by ( blue ) diagonal lines .",
    "in fact these lines represent the subdivision given by theorem [ resolve_nodes_2 ] .",
    "as we can see we have @xmath56 cases : we can resolve all nine nodes ; smooth 4 and resolve 5 ; smooth 6 and resolve 3 or smooth all 9 nodes .",
    "thus we have four different , smooth tropical manifolds . the gross - siebert reconstruction theorem gives four different calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "let us denote them respectively by @xmath398 , @xmath1466 , @xmath1467 and @xmath1468 .",
    "now let us consider the mirror manifolds @xmath1469 , @xmath1470 , @xmath1471 and @xmath1472 .",
    "these are obtained from @xmath15 respectively by smoothing all nine nodes ; resolving @xmath56 and smoothing @xmath281 ; resolving @xmath284 and smoothing @xmath1 or resolving all @xmath1416 nodes .",
    "we know that @xmath1469 corresponds to an example of schoen s calabi - yau @xcite .",
    "this can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath1473 and @xmath1474 be two rational elliptic surfaces with a section such that for no point @xmath1475 , @xmath1476 and @xmath1477 are both singular",
    ". then schoen s calabi - yau is the fibred product @xmath1478 .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that this calabi - yau can be represented as a complete intersection inside @xmath1479 of hypersurfaces of tridegree @xmath1480 and @xmath1481 .",
    "later gross showed in @xcite that the associated tropical manifold is precisely @xmath15 with all nine nodes smoothed ( see also @xcite for similar methods ) .",
    "so we expect that @xmath1469 is homeomorphic to schoen s calabi - yau ( see theorem 0.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath1482 , @xmath1483 and @xmath1484 .",
    "now @xmath1470 , @xmath1471 and @xmath1472 are related to @xmath1469 by a conifold transition at respectively @xmath56 , @xmath284 and @xmath1416 lagrangian spheres in @xmath1469 .",
    "therefore , applying ( [ contran_top ] ) , we obtain @xmath1485 , @xmath1486 and @xmath1487 .    applying the method described in @xcite , we have computed that the tropical manifold obtained from @xmath14 by smoothing all nodes corresponds to a complete intersection in @xmath1488 of polynomials of bidegree @xmath1489 , @xmath1490 and @xmath1491 .",
    "therefore we expect @xmath1468 to be homeomorphic to such a manifold .",
    "we have @xmath1492 , @xmath1493 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "obviously its mirror @xmath1472 has @xmath1494 and @xmath1495 .",
    "since @xmath1472 is related to @xmath1469 by a conifold transition at @xmath1416 lagrangian spheres in @xmath1469 , from ( [ contran_top ] ) we obtain @xmath1496 and @xmath1497 .",
    "therefore the vanishing cycles span a space of dimension @xmath281 in @xmath1498 .",
    "we believe , although we have not proved it , that five linearly independent lagrangian spheres correspond to the nodes ( in the mirror @xmath15 ) which are marked by a thick circle in figure [ re_sm ] .",
    "indeed , in the previous discussion , we observed that four nodes contained in a square ( of the dashed grid in figure [ re_sm ] ) are related by one relation .",
    "therefore we expect that their vanishing cycles span a space of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "observe that all @xmath1416 vanishing cycles can be obtained from the given @xmath281 using these relations .",
    "using these facts and ( [ contran_top ] ) , we conjecture that @xmath1499 @xmath1500 moreover we also have the mirrors @xmath398 , @xmath1466 , @xmath1467 and @xmath1468 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath1470 , @xmath1471 and @xmath1472 can be obtained as conifold transitions by classical methods from the equations defining @xmath1469 .",
    "however we do not know if the corresponding tropical manifolds can be obtained from known toric degenerations , such as in toric fano manifolds .",
    "moreover we do not know if the mirrors have ever been computed by more standard methods .",
    "here we generalize the above example .",
    "for every pair of integers @xmath1501 , ranging from @xmath1 to @xmath284 , we construct a tropical conifold as follows .",
    "take @xmath1502 copies of the triangular prism @xmath544 considered in ( [ prismt ] ) and divide them in two families each containing @xmath1503 copies .",
    "we denote the two families by @xmath1365 and @xmath1366 where @xmath1367 are cyclic indices of order @xmath1019 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "now , to form @xmath14 we do the same as above : we label the vertices of these prisms like in figure [ prism1 ] and we glue the @xmath0-dimensional faces by matching the vertices with the same labels .",
    "clearly , for @xmath1504 we obtain the same as above .",
    "observe that assembling @xmath1505 with the above rule looks like the pictures represented in figure [ triangles ] multiplied by the interval @xmath1506 $ ] .",
    "similarly we can say about @xmath1507 , with @xmath1019 in place of @xmath71 .",
    "as above , the union of all the @xmath1365 s on the one hand and of all the @xmath1366 s on the other gives two solid tori which are again glued together to form a @xmath1-sphere .",
    "the fan structures at vertices are defined in a very similar way to the example above .",
    "in fact at points of type @xmath1378 , @xmath1508 , the fan structure is exactly the same as in the example above , i.e. it is the fan of @xmath1389 . at a point of type @xmath1377 ( or @xmath1410 )",
    "it is also like in the example above if @xmath1509 ( resp . if @xmath1510 )",
    "otherwise we define it as follows . for integers @xmath1511 , consider the fan @xmath1512 in @xmath167 which can be seen at the common point ( i.e. the origin ) of all simplices in figure [ triangles ] .",
    "clearly @xmath1512 has @xmath1019 @xmath0-dimensional cones . denote them in clockwise order by @xmath1513 , where @xmath1514 is the one generated by @xmath1515 . then form the fan in @xmath184 whose cones are @xmath1516 and @xmath1517 $ ] .",
    "now , the @xmath1-dimensional polytopes which contain the point @xmath1377 are @xmath1518 and @xmath1519 , with @xmath1520 .",
    "the fan structure at @xmath1377 identifies the tangent wedge of @xmath1518 with @xmath1521 and of @xmath1522 with @xmath1523 .",
    "similarly we can define the fan structure at points of type @xmath1410 but with @xmath71 in place of @xmath1019 and the roles of @xmath710 and @xmath235 inverted .",
    "then we can also define a strictly convex piecewise linear function @xmath27 , just by suitably choosing one on each of the two types of fans .",
    "this defines our tropical conifold @xmath31 , depending on the choice of integers @xmath1524 .",
    "notice that we can not go beyond @xmath284 in this construction , because the polytopes in figure [ triangles ] would lose convexity at the point @xmath1525 and the tropical manifold would not be smooth in the sense of  [ gsreconstruction ] .",
    "discrete legendre transform gives the mirror @xmath32 .",
    "notice that again @xmath14 has a negative node on every square face that does not contain a point of type @xmath1410 or @xmath1377 , i.e. square faces that are on the boundary of the solid tori .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath1503 negative nodes .",
    "notice that in @xmath32 , the polytope mirror to a point @xmath1378 , @xmath1508 , is a cube .",
    "just as in the above example , this cube contains @xmath56 positive nodes which are related in the sense of definition [ pos_nodes_rel ] and can be simultaneously resolved using theorem [ resolve_nodes_1 ] .",
    "the negative nodes in @xmath14 which are mirror to these @xmath56 nodes are those contained in the prisms @xmath1368 , @xmath1526 , @xmath1527 , @xmath1528 . these can be simultaneously smoothed .",
    "notice that for every fixed @xmath710 ( or @xmath235 ) the @xmath71 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1019 ) nodes contained in the prisms @xmath1529 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1530 ) are also related ( see the example above ) , therefore they can be simultaneously resolved . depending on the choices of nodes to be simultaneously smoothed",
    "/ resolved we get diagrams similar to those in figure [ re_sm ] , but on an @xmath1531 grid . in figure [ re_sm2 ]",
    "we have represented the diagram for three new examples in the cases @xmath1532 is the pair @xmath1533 or @xmath1534 . in @xmath14",
    "these correspond to smoothing @xmath1450 , @xmath1535 or @xmath1536 nodes respectively and resolving the others .",
    "we believe that by smoothing all nodes in @xmath15 we still get schoen s calabi - yau .",
