    "the study of the mixed state in type - ii superconductors has a long history and revealed a wide variety of physical phenomena.@xcite in the clean limit , low - energy bound states , dubbed andreev bound states , are formed in the vortex core due to the spatial profile of the superconducting pair potential .",
    "@xcite the bound states manifest themselves as an enhancement of zero - energy quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) in the core , observable as a zero - bias conductance peak by scanning tunneling microscope.@xcite recently , the andreev bound states have been revisited from the viewpoint of _ the odd frequency pairing . _",
    "@xcite    generally , superconducting pairing is classified into even - frequency or odd - frequency state according to a symmetry with respect to time .",
    "due to the fermi statistics , even - frequency superconducntors belong to the symmetry class of spin - singlet even - parity or spin - triplet odd - parity pairing state , while odd - frequency superconductors belong to the spin - singlet odd - parity or spin - triplet even - parity pairing state .",
    "although the possibility of the odd - frequency pairing state in various kinds of uniform systems was discussed in the literature , @xcite its realization in bulk materials is still controversial . on the other hand ,",
    "the realization of the odd - frequency pairing state has recently been pointed out in inhomogeneous even - frequency superconducting systems such as ferromagnet / superconductor junctions,@xcite normal metal / superconductor interface,@xcite abrikosov vortex@xcite or a diffusive normal metal attached to a spin - triplet superconductor.@xcite    in ref .",
    ", pairing symmetry in an isolated vortex is elucidated .",
    "it is found that at the center of the core , purely odd frequency pairing state exists . since single vortex",
    "is considered in ref .",
    ", this theory is applicable to the low field regime . on the other hand , at high magnetic fields ,",
    "the distance between vortices becomes short , and hence the overlap effect of the vortex cores can not be neglected . in this situation ,",
    "the local dos around a vortex core is expected to break cylindrical symmetry and show sixfold symmetric structure when the vortex lattice forms a triangular lattice.@xcite also , at high field regime , fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) vortex state may be realized under some conditions.@xcite these states are also inhomogeneous systems , which may provide rich structure of superconducting correlation , in particular odd frequency pairing .",
    "the fflo state  @xcite is realized by cooper pairs with non - zero center of mass momentum when the fermi surfaces for up - spin and down - spin electron bands are largely split by the zeeman effect , thus inducing the spatial modulation of the pair potential .",
    "@xcite several experiments support the realization of the fflo state in a high field phase of a quasi - two dimensional ( q2d ) heavy fermion superconductor @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite there , it is supposed that the fflo nodal planes of the pair potential run perpendicular to the vortex lines . in general , we have to include the vortex structure in addition to the fflo modulation , because the fflo state appears at high fields in the mixed states.@xcite the vortex and fflo nodal plane structures in the fflo state were studied in refs .  .",
    "it is found that the topological structure of the pair potential plays important roles to determine the electronic structures in the fflo vortex state .",
    "the pair potential has @xmath1-phase winding around the vortex line , and @xmath2-phase shift at the nodal plane of the fflo modulation .",
    "these topologies of the pair potential structure affect the distribution of paramagnetic moment and low energy electronic states inside the superconducting gap .",
    "another aspect of the fflo state is the parity mixing . in the fflo state , in addition to the breakdown of the translational symmetry , zeeman field breaks the su(2 ) symmetry in spin space . as a consequence , singlet - triplet mixing state emerges as a stable phase in the fflo state .",
    "@xcite therefore , quite gerenally , in the fflo state mixture of even - odd frequency and singlet - triplet pairings is expected to emerge .    in this paper ,",
    "based on the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity , we investigate pairing symmetry in the fflo vortex and vortex lattice , and explain the electronic structure in these states in terms of pairing symmetry .",
    "we show analytically that at the intersection point of fflo nodal plane and vortex line , only even frequency pairing is present if the zeeman splitting is negligibly small . with increasing zeeman splitting ,",
    "odd frequency pairing emerges there .",
    "this makes it possible to interpret the gap structure of the density of states at the intersection point as a manifestation of the even frequency pairing . in the vortex lattice , at the core centers ,",
    "only odd frequency pairing is present while at the midpoint of the vortex lines , only even frequency pairing appears irrespective of the energy .",
    "therefore , the odd and even frequency pairings also form the lattice in the vortex lattice state .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we study the fflo vortex state , and show the electric structure and superconducting correlation of the system .",
    "iii is devoted to the study of the vortex lattice .",
    "the summary is given in sec .",
    "the electronic structure of the vortex core in an inhomogeneous clean superconductor can be described by the quasiclassical eilenberger equations @xcite based on the riccati parametrization@xcite . along a trajectory @xmath3 with unit vector @xmath4 parallel to fermi velocity @xmath5 ,",
    "the eilenberger equations are generally represented in 4@xmath6 matrix form@xcite , which , in terms of the ricatti parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , reduces to:@xcite @xmath9 with the self energy of the zeeman splitting @xmath10 and pauli matrix @xmath11 . here , we have defined 2@xmath12 matrix @xmath7 and @xmath8 in spin space via the 4@xmath6 green s functions @xmath13 : @xmath14    there are two possible spatial modulation of the pair potential @xmath15 in the fflo states .",
    "one is the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) state  @xcite with phase modulation such as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the modulation vector of the fflo states .",
    "the other is the larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) state  @xcite with the amplitude modulation such as @xmath18 , where the the pair potential shows the periodic sign change , and @xmath19 at nodal planes .",
    "we discuss the case of the lo states in this paper , since some experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite works support the lo state ( at least in low temperature region ) for the fflo states in @xmath0 .",
    "when we consider vortex structure in the lo state , there are two possible choices of the configuration for the vortex lines and the fflo modulation : the modulation vector of the fflo state is parallel  @xcite or perpendicular  @xcite to the applied magnetic field . in this paper",
    ", we study the former case by the quasiclassical theory as shown in fig .",
    "@xcite    as a model of fermi surface in @xmath0 , we use a q2d fermi surface with rippled cylinder - shape , and the fermi velocity is given by @xmath20 at the fermi surface @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite in our calculation we set @xmath24 , so that the anisotropy ratio @xmath25 .",
    "here , @xmath26 is an averaged fermi velocity on the fermi surface .",
    "@xmath27 indicates the fermi surface average .",
    "a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath28 axis direction in our calculation .",
    "thus , the coordinate @xmath29 for the vortex structure corresponds to @xmath30 of the crystal coordinate .",
    "we consider @xmath31-wave fflo vortex state , and choose the following form of the pair potential : @xmath32 with @xmath33 . here",
    ", we introduce the coherence length @xmath34 , the vortex line is situated at @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the phase factor which originates from the vortex .    for the calculation of the local dos",
    "normalized by its value in the normal state , the quasiclassical propagator has to be integrated over @xmath37 and @xmath38 which define the direction of the fermi velocity .",
    "the normalized local dos in terms of functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 is given by    @xmath39_{\\omega _",
    "n   \\to e + i\\delta } \\label{angularaverage}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 denotes the quasiparticle energy with respect to the fermi level and @xmath41 is an effective scattering parameter . in numerical calculations throughout this paper",
    ", we will fix this value as @xmath42 .",
    "we obtain singlet ( triplet ) pair amplitude @xmath43 as @xmath44 its even ( odd ) frequency component , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , is obtained as @xmath47 note that due to the fermi statistics , for singlet pairing , even ( odd ) parity state should be even ( odd ) frequency pairing , while for triplet pairing , even ( odd ) parity state should be odd ( even ) frequency pairing .",
    "their average in momentum space is defined as @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the magnitude of the even ( odd ) frequency pairing can be repesented as @xmath50      in the fflo vortex state , along the trajectory through the intersection point of a vortex and a nodal plane , the gap function does not change sign , because the phase shift is 2@xmath2 by summing @xmath2 due to the vortex and @xmath2 due to the nodal plane.@xcite consequently , the dos at the intersection point does not have the andreev bound state which is seen in the conventional vortex state or fflo nodal plane .",
    "our analysis presented below makes it possible to understand these features of dos from the viewpoint of the symmetry of superconducting correlations .",
    "first , we discuss the general property of the symmetry in the fflo vortex state .",
    "consider a trajectory passing through the intersection point of vortex line and fflo nodal plane . by setting @xmath51 at the intersection point",
    ", we obtain @xmath52 from the eilenberger equations since the gap function does not change sign at @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "thus , at the intersection point @xmath51 , we have @xmath54 , and hence @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this means that at the intersection point , only even - frequency spin - singlet even - parity and odd - frequency spin - triplet even - parity parings are allowed to exist [ note that even ( odd ) frequency singlet ( triplet ) pairing should have even parity in accordance with the fermi statistics ] .",
    "in particular , at @xmath57 since spin is conserved , at the intersection point only even - frequency spin - singlet even - parity pairing exists . with increasing @xmath58 , odd - frequency spin - triplet even - parity pairing emerges there . in a similar way",
    ", we can show that at the center of the fflo nodal plane ( vortex core ) without vortex ( the fflo modulation ) , @xmath59 is satisfied since the gap function changes sign at @xmath51 and @xmath60 .",
    "hence , only odd - frequency spin - singlet odd - parity and even - frequency spin - triplet odd - parity pairings are allowed there .",
    "in particular , at @xmath58=0 , only odd - frequency spin - singlet odd - parity pairing is present .",
    "the suppression ( enhancement ) of the local dos at zero energy is related to the presence of even ( odd)-frequency pairing.@xcite it has been shown that the emergence of the odd - frequency pairing is a physical reason of zero energy peak of the local dos inside the vortex core.@xcite    next , we show the results of dos and pair amplitudes by numerically solving the eilenberger equation . in the following we set @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows ( a ) the local dos , ( b ) magnitude of even frequency pairing and ( c ) magnitude of odd frequency pairing as a function of the energy at the intersection point @xmath63 . at @xmath57 , local dos shows a gap structure , which reflects that at the intersection point , only even frequency pairing exists at @xmath57 as seen in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] ( b ) and ( c ) . with increasing @xmath58 ,",

    "[ f2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) . as @xmath58 increases , these structures are shifted and even frequency pairing emerges there . note that here spin singlet ( triplet ) state dominates spin triplet ( singlet ) state in even ( odd ) frequency pairing . this can be understood by considering the vortex without the fflo nodal plane . in this case , only odd parity pairing is allowed at the core center .",
    "therefore , at the core center far away from the fflo nodal plane , we can also expect that odd parity pairing dominates .",
    "figure [ f3 ] depicts the results at the fflo nodal plane , @xmath65 .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar to those in fig .",
    "quantitative difference may originate from the dimensionality of the andreev bound states : 1d in vortex line and 2d in the fflo nodal plane .",

    "[ f3 ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",

    "[ f3 ] ( b ) is physically due to the penetration of the even frequency pairing at the intersection point into the fflo nodal plane .",

    "correspondingly , large magnitude of the odd frequency ( spin singlet odd parity ) pairing is seen at the fflo nodal plane and vortex line , while at the intersection point or far away from both the fflo nodal plane and vortex line , only even frequency ( spin singlet even parity ) pairing exists .",

    "[ f6 ] ( c ) is rather different from that in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ( f ) .",
