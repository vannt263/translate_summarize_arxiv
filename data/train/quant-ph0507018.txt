    "the problem of reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity is one of the task of modern theoretical physics which , until now , has not yet found a consistent and satisfactory solution . although a full description of quantum gravity is not yet available , there are some general features that seem to go hand in hand with all promising candidates for such a theory where one of them is the existence of a minimal length scale . in other words ,",
    "one of the most interesting consequences of unification of gravity and quantum mechanics is that in resulting quantum gravity there exists a minimal observable distance on the order of the planck length , @xmath0 , where g is the newton constant .",
    "the existence of such a fundamental length is a dynamical phenomenon due to the fact that , at planck scale , there are fluctuations of the background metric , i.e. a limit of the order of planck length appears when quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field are taken into account . in the language of string theory",
    "one can say that a string can not probe distances smaller than its length .",
    "the existence of such minimal observable length which is motivated from string theory[1 - 7],loop quantum gravity[8 ] , quantum geometry[9 ] and black holes physics[10 ] , leads to a generalization of heisenberg uncertainty principle to incorporate gravitational induced uncertainty from very beginning .",
    "this feature constitutes a part of the motivation to study the effects of this modified algebra on various observables .",
    "consequences of such a gravitational uncertainty principle ( gup ) , have been studied extensively[11 - 20 ] .",
    "the generalization of schrdinger equation has been considered by hossenfelder _",
    "et al_[21 ] . also generalized schrdinger equation and hydrogen spectrum in the framework of gup",
    "have been considered by brau[22 ] and akhoury and yao[23 ] .",
    "momentum space representation of quantum states has been considered by kempf _",
    "et al_[24 ] . here",
    "we proceed some more step in this direction .",
    "we consider some well - known topics in usual quantum mechanics and re - examine them in the framework of gup .",
    "the problems of a particle in an one - dimensional box and momentum space wave function(in a different view relative to kempf _",
    "et al _ point of view ) are considered and their generalization in gup are discussed .",
    "the emergence of a minimal observable distance yields to the generalized uncertainty principle @xmath1 where @xmath2 is gup parameter which can be determined from fundamental theory(maybe string theory!)[6 ] . at energy much below the planck mass , @xmath3 , the extra term in right hand side of equation ( 1 ) is irrelevant and the heisenberg relation is recovered , while , as we approach the planck energy , this term becomes relevant and , as has been said , it is related to the minimal observable length .",
    "a simple calculation gives @xmath4 for this minimum length scale .",
    "now the generalized commutation relation becomes , @xmath5=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^2),\\ ] ] where @xmath6 ( related to @xmath2 ) is a constant restricted to the condition : @xmath7 .",
    "the case @xmath8 gives the usual quantum mechanics regime while @xmath9 is extreme quantum gravity limit .",
    "it is important to note that gup itself has a perturbational nature and one can consider its more generalized form[24 ] .",
    "since we are dealing with dynamics , the present form of gup as equation ( 1 ) is more suitable as our primary input .",
    "consider a spinless quantum particle with mass @xmath10 confined to the following one - dimensional box @xmath11 ordinary schrdinger equation for such a particle is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is momentum operator .",
    "in gup , existence of minimal length scale leads to the following generalization of momentum operator[22,23 ] @xmath14,\\ ] ] up to first order of @xmath6 .",
    "now the schrdinger equation generalizes to @xmath15 where can be written as @xmath16 now we want to solve this eigenvalue problem .",
    "existence of minimum observable length means that one can not have localized states .",
    "the very notion of locality and position space representation breaks down in gup .",
    "however as kempf _",
    "et al _ have shown[24 ] , when there is no minimal uncertainty in momentum , one can work with the convenient representation of the commutation relations on momentum space wave function .",
    "then one can define states with maximal localization which are proper physical states .",
    "one can use them to define a quasi - position representation .",
    "this representation has a direct interpretation in terms of position measurements , although it does not diagonalize position operator . here ,",
    "since we are dealing with ( 1 ) which has no minimum uncertainty in momentum , we can use such quasi - position states , @xmath17 which are maximally localized .",
    "+ now the general solution of equation ( 7 ) is @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are constant coefficients .",
    "the general solution is a superposition of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "considering boundary condition in @xmath26 leads to the result that @xmath23 and @xmath27 should not be considered in physical solution .",
    "on the other hand , boundary condition in @xmath28 implies that @xmath22 should not be present in final solution since in @xmath28 wave function should be vanishing .",
    "therefore , to satisfy boundary conditions only @xmath24 is physically reasonable .",
    "it is important to note that in the framework of quantum mechanical perturbational approach , one recovers only @xmath24 as leading order solution , which approves the above statement . in other words ,",
    "considering the term proportional to @xmath6 in generalized schrdinger equation as perturbation , one recovers @xmath29 as the leading order wave function .",
    "therefore , the solution of generalized schrdinger equation with the prescribed boundary conditions is @xmath30x.\\ ] ] defining @xmath31 boundary condition in @xmath26 leads to @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "therefore @xmath34 .",
    "after normalization one finds @xmath35 now the energy condition @xmath36 leads to @xmath37 up to first order in @xmath6 .",
    "note that in the framework of gup up to first order in @xmath6 there is no change in eigenstates of the quantum particle in box but we have a shift of energy levels equal to @xmath38 .",
    "when @xmath9 , that is , in extreme quantum gravity limit , this energy shift plays very important role .",
    "figure 1 shows the corresponding situation .",
    "as this figure shows increasing @xmath6 leads to increasing shift in energy levels .",
    "in ordinary quantum mechanics it is often useful to expand the states @xmath39 in the position eigenbasis @xmath40 as @xmath41 . as has been indicated , in gup due to the existence of minimal length scale which can not be probed ,",
    "there are no physical states to perform a position eigenbasis .",
    "although there is a one parameter family of @xmath42-eigenbases , related to the minimal uncertainty in position , but these bases consists of no physical states .",
    "furthermore they could not even be approximated by physical states of increasing localization .",
    "however we can still project arbitrary states @xmath43 on maximally localized states @xmath44 to obtain the probability amplitude for the particle being maximally localized around the position @xmath42[24 ] .",
    "in which follows we consider these maximally localized wave functions .",
    "+ the eigenvalue equation for momentum space wave function in ordinary quantum mechanics is @xmath45 which @xmath13 stands for momentum operator with @xmath46 as its eigenvalue and @xmath47 as its eigenfunction .",
    "position space representation of @xmath13 is as follows @xmath48 therefore one finds @xmath49 which has solution such as @xmath50 now we consider gravitational induced uncertainty which leads to the following generalized form for @xmath13 @xmath14\\ ] ] up to first order in @xmath6 .",
    "eigenvalue equation in this case should be modified as follows @xmath51u_{p}(x)=pu_{p}(x),\\ ] ] which can be written as @xmath52 this equation has a complicated solution @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are complex quantities @xmath56\\beta^{2 } \\big)^{2/3}\\ ] ] and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "a lengthy calculation gives the following result for momentum space wave function up to first order of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath58 it is important to note that this wave function reduces to ( 17 ) in the limit of @xmath8 as a consequence of correspondence principle .",
    "although position space representation fails to be valid in the case of gup due to existence of a minimal observable length , one can consider maximally localized states to obtain the probability amplitude for the particle being maximally localized around the position @xmath42 . in this paper , following such a viewpoint , we have calculated eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a spinless particle confined in an one - dimensional potential box .",
    "we have shown that up to first order in gup parameter , there is no change in eigenfunctions , but there is a shift to energy levels which has considerable effect in the extreme quantum gravity limit@xmath9 . following the maximally localized picture ,",
    "we have found momentum space wave function for a free particle . actually some care should be taken into account regarding the notion of `` free particle '' , since now due to gravitational effect the particle is no longer free .",
