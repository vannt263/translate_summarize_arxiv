    "supersolidity is a unique state of matter that simultaneously displays both superfluidity and crystalline order .",
    "much of our understanding of this exotic state is based on the pioneering work of penrose and onsager,@xcite andreev and lifshitz,@xcite chester and reatto,@xcite leggett,@xcite and anderson.@xcite recently , anderson and coworkers revisited this problem .",
    "@xcite current developments in this field , presented at a kitp workshop at santa barbara , are available online.@xcite    @xmath0he  has long been thought to be the most likely candidate for the supersolid state .",
    "torsional oscillator experiments by kim and chan @xcite generated renewed interest in this possibility .",
    "@xcite in addition to the work of kim and chan , @xcite there is now an independent confirmation of the anomalous behavior of solid @xmath0he , as presented by the groups of reppy and shirahama.@xcite all of these groups use torsional oscillators similar to those employed by kim and chan.@xcite rittner and reppy @xcite report history dependence of the signal , when annealing the sample , to the extent of no observation of any mass decoupling in the torsional oscillator experiment . on the other hand , rapid freezing of helium leads to disorder and a drastic increase of the signal.@xcite taken at face value ,",
    "these torsional oscillator experiments indicate an anomalous mechanical behavior of solid @xmath0he  at low temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , the connection between the mechanical measurements and the suggested supersolidity remains tenuous .",
    "the case for supersolidity entails a certain assumption , which we will discuss at length below , for the interpretation of the oscillator data .    the measurements by refs .",
    "monitor the period of torsional oscillators in the presence of an applied torque .",
    "the purpose of our work is to examine the mechanical properties of the torsional oscillator",
    ". we will only allude to linear response theory and causality ( the kramers - kronig relations ) .",
    "we show that the change in torsional oscillator period may be triggered by a change in damping and other oscillator parameters .",
    "such a change may result from a low - temperature quench of residual topological defects in the solidification into a glass . here",
    ", we will use the term `` liquidlike '' component to describe elastic defects that are not pinned above a glass transition at high temperatures . in ref .",
    ", we first explained how a low - temperature pinning of elastic defects ( two - level tunneling systems ) can account for the reported excess low - temperature specific heat with regards to a perfect debye crystal .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "are at odds with a _",
    "simple _ uniform supersolid transition , but can also occur in an exotic glassy supersolid state as discussed by boninsegni et al .",
    "@xcite or wu and phillips@xcite .",
    "the effects described in this paper may account for the observed change of the torsional oscillator period .",
    "the central thesis of our current work is that there is no imperative to adduce a supersolid fraction which depends very sensitively on a host of external parameters in order to explain the reduction in the torsional oscillator period as temperature is lowered .",
    "rather , the observed trends might be a very natural and quite universal outcome of a glass transition ( regardless of its classical or quantum nature ) .",
    "a direct proof of superfluidity would be the observation of persistent current . in this regard ,",
    "we note a recent experimental search for superflow by day et .",
    "al.,@xcite who found no mass flow of any kind to very high accuracy . relying on these results and , most notably , on a new thermodynamic analysis , we recently concluded @xcite that the effect first observed @xcite is likely not an intrinsic property of solid @xmath0he .",
    "this is so because the low - temperature behavior depends critically on the @xmath1he  concentration , shows annealing and rapid freezing dependence , @xcite and , most importantly , has a specific heat which is inconsistent with a simple supersolid transition of a 1% condensate fraction.@xcite however , our earlier work @xcite does not rule out a supersolid fraction of order @xmath2 .",

    "we conclude in sec .",
    "( [ conc ] ) with a brief summary of our results and their relevance to the torsional oscillator data of refs .  .",
    "in the appendix ( sec .  [ alts ] ) , we illustrate that other , non - glass , response functions can also account for the data without assuming a supersolid transition .",
    "we will address the linear response theory of a driven torsional oscillator and derive our key results in sec .",
    "( [ glass_section ] ) .",
    "a general treatment of the problem involves the analysis of possible modes in the vessel which are excited by the external torque and their influence on the torsional oscillator . depending on their character",
    ", such modes can easily be disrupted by the insertion of barriers and lead to a far smaller difference between the response of a liquidlike component and that of a glasslike component . to make the discussion clear , we will focus on a simple form for these modes , which are characteristic of glass formers . here",
    "we will show :    a glass transition , irrespective of whether or not it appears in a normal solid or supersolid , leads to specific testable predictions for the oscillator period and dissipation.@xcite unlike a _ simple _ supersolid transition , i.e. , a transition where only a change in the inertia of the oscillator occurs , our key result eq .",
    "( [ gfinalg ] ) predicts that , as the temperature is lowered , two principal trends will be noted : ( i ) a monotonic decrease in the oscillator period and ( ii ) a peak in the dissipation . a uniform , mean - field type , supersolid transition can not account for phenomenon ( ii ) .",
    "it is important to stress , that unlike all of the works to date , we do not assume that only a supersolid can account for the observed decrease in the oscillator period [ feature ( i ) ] . indeed , as we show for the first time , glassy relaxations mandate the current observations of features ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "this occurs universally and is independent of the specific microscopic mechanism by which relaxation processes occur or the detailed character of the glass .",
    "it is nevertheless encouraging to note that samples in which the most pronounced anomalous behavior is observed contain defects.@xcite    we considered other ( non - glass ) `` freezing '' transitions that can also account for the empirical trends . to make this concrete , in the appendix a",
    ", we will detail how a decrease in damping ( as a result of a freezing transition ) can also account for the observed tendencies . unlike for the results discussed above",
    ", here we can not provide a specific functional form to fit to . to provide the simplest qualitative form",
    ", we invoke gaussian distributions for the quantities in question .",
    "finally , we note that throughout our work , our general form for the angular response allows for a dependence on external parameters such as the initial oscillator velocity .",
    "these parameters , e.g. stiffness and density and cell torsional frequency , which parameterize the external torques , are convolved with the intrinsic angular response .",
    "a _ liquidlike _",
    "component in the cell may respond differently to different initial oscillator velocities .",
    "such a dependence is observed experimentally .",
    "aside from other possible effects , external parameters [ whether in a supersolid , a glass , or in any other phase ] will also always appear via their incorporation in the external torques in the general form for the angular response .",
    "the basic idea underlying the torsional oscillator measurements is a test of the non - classical rotational inertia ( ncri ) - the inability of a superfluid to rotate under an applied torsional drive .",
    "the analog of this experiment on liquid @xmath0he  was performed by andronikashvili .",

    "however , if the oscillator is stopped abruptly and let go at temperatures above the glass transition , then the vessel contains a liquidlike component and the torsional oscillator will wobble due to the motion of the residual liquidlike component . here , the liquidlike component will still move even after the container is stopped .",
    "this internal liquidlike motion will lead to a momentum transfer to the outer torsional oscillator once the container is let go .",
    "hence , the oscillator will wobble .",
    "in conclusion , we report on a simple alternate proposal of the origin of the decrease in the torsional oscillator period in solid helium .",
    "@xcite we argue that changes in the oscillation period are triggered by changes in damping and the effective stiffness in the susceptibility and are not due to a supersolid state formation .",
    "we point out that the torsional oscillator mechanical properties can be controlled by a number of effects such as damping , stiffness coefficient and moment of inertia changes . the supersolid interpretation ,",
    "if such a state exists , would lead to changes in moment of inertia .",
    "this was the interpretation taken in refs .  .",
    "on the other hand , low - temperature quenching of residual topological defects in the solidification into a glass can also account for the current observation of a drop in the torsional oscillator period as the temperature is reduced .",
    "this effect not only accounts for the decrease in the rotation period ( fig .",
    "[ figp ] ) , but also predicts a peak in the dissipation , see fig .  [ figq ] , as indeed observed .",
    "@xcite furthermore , our alternate glass scenario can account for the observed dependence of the oscillator dynamics on external parameters .",
    "we have developed a basic understanding of how a simplified response of a glass can account for the essential physics results of the torsional oscillator experiments .",

    "this collapse follows from eqs .",

    "the more accurate detailed predictions [ albeit with more phenomenological glass parameters ] follow from eqs.([central_glass ] , [ gfinalg ] , [ vft ] ) .",
    "we leave this analysis for a separate discussion when more data are available .    * ( 3 ) * the blockage of the annulus in the torsional oscillator cell may drastically change the strain field and dynamics inside the cell .",
    "such changes of the boundary conditions can inhibit the presence of various elastic modes relative to those which are present in a system with no blockage .",
    "for instance , azimuthal elastic modes which may be present in an `` o - type '' cylindrical geometry can not appear in a blocked `` c - type '' cylindrical configuration .",
    "more generally , any modification to the boundary conditions , e.g. , oscillator velocity or amplitude , sample surface or roughness , would shift the freezing - out temperature and damping .",
    "for instance , large amplitude vibrations may thwart the quench of a liquidlike component into a glass .",
    "such an avoidance of the glass transition will , consequently , lessen the low temperature variations in the oscillator dynamics .",
    "all of these effects will necessarily lead to different experimental observables without a need for invoking a supersolid fraction which somehow depends very sensitively on all of these parameters .    as a matter of principle",
    ", our glass picture explains the data even if a glass transition accompanies the transition into a supersolid state .",
    "@xcite what we show is that whether or not a tiny supersolid fraction is present- the changes in the dynamics can be naturally ascribed to a glass transition rather than to a non classical rotational inertia ( ncri ) effect .",
    "our results demonstrate that a low - temperature glass can very naturally account for the current data .",
    "what our analysis suggests is whether or not a very small supersolid fraction is present , what triggers the change in period may ( very naturally ) be a hallmark of the transition into a glassy state .",
    "the changes in the torsional oscillator period need not be accounted for by only a non clasical rotational inertia effect .",
    "a glass transition ( whether it is classical or quantum is immaterial on this level of our analysis ) may further naturally account for the observed subtle dependence of the effect on external parameters as well as the concurrency of the peak in the damping with the change in oscillator period .",
    "it is worth noting that a decrease in the rotational period along with a peak in the dissipation can be triggered by a host of many other related effects - none of which relies on a ncri effect . as an example , in the appendix we detail an alternate model in which the dissipation decreases by the solidification of liquidlike ( topological ) defects into a non - glassy low - temperature phase .",
    "similarly , any other effect which leads to a decrease in the oscillator period with decreasing temperature and exhibits a peak in @xmath41 can account for the current data .    finally , an experiment in which a torsional oscillator holding @xmath0he  is first cooled when it is at rest , then set in motion and abruptly stopped and let go , might allow further comparison with the glass origin that we propose here for the anomalous low temperature dynamics .",
    "for a glass transition scenario , we expect ( 1 ) that at temperatures above the glass transition , the liquidlike component will cause the torsional oscillator to wobble . while ( 2 ) the same experiment performed sufficiently below the glass transition temperature , the glass and container will stop in unison without wobbling .",
