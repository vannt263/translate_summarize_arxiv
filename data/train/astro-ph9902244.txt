    "it has been proposed that molecular outflows , at least from low and intermediate mass young stars , may be driven by highly collimated jets ( see , for example , padman , bence & richer @xcite ) .",
    "although the likely mechanism by which such jets transfer their momentum to the ambient medium remains unknown , a number of ideas have been put forward ( for a review of models the reader is referred to cabrit , raga & gueth @xcite ) . of these",
    "the most promising seems to be the so - called `` prompt entrainment '' mechanism . according to this model the bulk of the molecular outflow",
    "is accelerated ambient gas near the head of the jet or more precisely along the wings of its associated bow shock .",
    "observational support for prompt entrainment comes from the spatial coincidence of shocked molecular hydrogen bows with peaks in the co outflow emission ( e.g.  davis & eislffel ) .",
    "smith , suttner & yorke ( @xcite ) and suttner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have carried out a number of 3-d simulations of dense molecular jets propagating into a dense medium in order to test the prompt entrainment hypothesis .",
    "these authors found that their simulations reproduced many of the observational characteristics of molecular flows including the so - called ` hubble law ' ( see , e.g. padman et al .",
    "@xcite ) and strong forward , as opposed to sideways , motion ( lada & fich @xcite ) .",
    "while such results are encouraging for jet - driven models , it is still fair to say that no individual model has yet been able to plausibly account for all the observations ( lada & fich @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , alternatives to the jet model may be better at explaining the observational characteristics of some molecular flows ( e.g.  padman et al .",

    "@xcite ) .    the limited resolution of the 3-d jet simulations of smith et al .   ( @xcite ) , and suttner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , along with the high densities used by these authors , meant that they could not resolve the post - shock cooling regions in the flow .",
    "in addition it was not possible to explore parameter space as only a few such simulations could be performed .",
    "here we take a somewhat different approach by assuming low density atomic / molecular jet mixtures , a low density ambient medium and cylindrical symmetry .",
    "although such an approach obviously has it limitations , it does allow us to explore parameter space more fully and to resolve post - shock cooling regions ( this might be important , for example , if one is to gauge the importance of certain instabilities ) .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to investigate the efficiency of yso jets in accelerating ambient molecular gas _ without causing dissociation _ of its molecules .",
    "an additional question we address in this paper is whether velocity variations ( pulsing ) of the jet might enhance transfer of momentum from the jet to its surroundings and thus help to accelerate ambient gas .",
    "pulsing induces internal shocks which can squeeze jet gas sideways ( raga et al .",
    "this gas does not interact with the ambient medium directly , but is instead squirted into the cocoon of processed ( post - shock ) jet gas , which separates the jet from the `` shroud '' of post - shock ambient gas .",
    "chernin & masson ( ) however argue that , through the cocoon , momentum from the jet may be continuously coupled to the ambient flow .",
    "the properties of the simulated systems in which we are interested are as follows :    * how much momentum is transferred to the ambient molecules ?",
    "* is there a power - law relationship predicted between mass in the molecular flow and velocity ?",
    "* what are the proper motions of the molecular ` knots ' , and how does their emission behave with time ?",
    "* is the so - called ` hubble law ' of molecular outflows reproduced under reasonable conditions ?",
    "* is there extra entrainment of ambient gas along the jet due to velocity variations",

    "the dissociation coefficient @xmath13 is obtained from dove & mandy ( ) and the ionization rate , @xmath23 , is that used by falle & raga ( ) .",
    "these equations are solved in a 2d cylindrically symmetric geometry using a temporally and spatially second order accurate muscl scheme ( van leer @xcite ; falle @xcite ) . the code uses a linear riemann solver except where the resolved pressure differs from either the left or right state at the cell interface by greater than 10% where it uses a non - linear solver ( following falle 1996 , private communication ) .",
    "non - linear riemann solvers allow correct treatment of shocks and rarefactions without artificial viscosity or entropy fixes . applying them only in non - smooth regions of the flow",
    "means that , while the benefits are the same , the computational overhead is minimised .",
    "this code is an updated version of that described in downes & ray ( ) .",
    "sometimes negative pressures are predicted by simulations involving radiative cooling .",
    "typically these are overcome by simply resetting the calculated pressure to an arbitrary , but small , positive value .",
    "however , this involves injecting internal energy into the system and this is undesirable . a fairly reliable way of overcoming this problem is discussed in appendix a.      initially the ambient density and pressure on the grid are uniform and defined so that the ambient temperature on the grid is @xmath24 k. the jet temperature is set to @xmath25 k. the function @xmath21 is set to zero below this latter temperature as the data used in the cooling functions becomes unreliable and cooling below this temperature is not dynamically significant anyway .",
    "in most cases the ratio of jet density to ambient density ( @xmath26 ) is set to 1 ( see table [ list_sims ] ) . the ratio @xmath27 both inside and outside the jet , unless otherwise indicated ( again , see table [ list_sims ] ) . in all cases",

    "we find that the efficiency of momentum transfer is sensitive to the grid spacing .",
    "we performed a number of simulations with different spacings and concluded that this is the absolute minimum necessary to get reliable results .",
    "this length should be reduced with increasing density .",
    "incidentally this means that examining this property at the densities used by , for example , smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is impractical .",

    "here @xmath40 is effectively an amplitude for the velocity variations where present .",
    "the jet is initially given a small shear layer of about 5 cells ( @xmath41 cm ) in order to avoid numerical problems at the boundary between the jet and ambient medium .",
    "in this layer the velocity decays linearly to zero .",
    "nine simulations were run with varying values of density and velocity perturbation .",
    "these are listed in table [ list_sims ] which also gives the key we will use to refer to the simulations . in addition simulations of a purely atomic jet , and of a jet with a wide shear layer of almost 25 cells ( @xmath42 cm ) were run .",

    "although this is very young compared to the observed age of stellar jets , it was felt that the qualitative behaviour of the system at longer times could reliably be inferred from these results .",
    "the densities chosen are rather low to ensure adequate resolution of the system as described above .",

    "if we write @xmath46 then we find that @xmath1 lies between 1.58 and 3.75 and that @xmath1 tends to increase with time , in agreement with smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "table [ fractions ] shows the values of @xmath1 at @xmath47 yrs for all the models .",
    "these values are consistent with observations ( e.g.   davis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and also with the analytical model presented in the appendix of smith et al . ( @xcite ) for the variations of mass with velocity . however , it is important to emphasise that what is actually observed is a variation in co line intensity with velocity .",
    "co line intensity is directly proportional to mass , in the relevant velocity channel , providing we are in the optically thin regime and the temperature of the gas is higher than the excitation temperature of the line ( see , e.g. mckee et al.@xcite ) .",
    "note that smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) incorrectly state that the channel line brightness scales with @xmath48 .",
    "[ m - v ] shows a sample plot of the molecular mass versus velocity for the jet moving at an angle of @xmath49 to the plane of the sky .",
    "we do not see the jet contribution in the velocity range chosen here .",
    "the molecular fraction in the jet has a marked influence on the value of @xmath1 predicted by these models as we can see by comparing the results for simulations g and g2 .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 increases with decreasing molecular abundance in the jet .",
    "this is due to the reduction in strength of the high velocity jet component .",
    "it appears that @xmath1 does not depend in a systematic way on the amplitude of the velocity variations .",
    "note also that the introduction of a wide shear layer dramatically reduces @xmath1 .",
    "this is due to the fact that more gas is ejected out of the jet beam ( because of the more strongly paraboloid shape of the internal working surfaces ) and this accelerates the cocoon gas , leading to a stronger high velocity component .",
    "in addition , a wide shear layer causes the bow shock to be more blunt .",
    "it can be seen from the analytic model of smith et al.(@xcite ) that this also leads to a lower value of @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that lower values of gamma , which may be more common in molecular outflows from lower luminosity sources ( see davis et al .",
    "@xcite ) could result from such flows having a higher molecular fraction in their jets and perhaps a wide shear layer .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath1 with viewing angle is the same as that noted by smith et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the actual values of @xmath1 obtained by these authors are somewhat lower than those obtained here . however , since our initial conditions are so different , and since @xmath1 is dependent on the shape of the bow shock , this discrepancy is not disturbing .",
    "we measured the apparent motion of the emission from the internal working surfaces .",
    "near the axis of the jet this emission moves with the average jet speed ( i.e.  @xmath50 ) , as would be expected from momentum balance arguments .",
    "however , there are knots of emission arising from the bow shock itself and these move much more slowly ( @xmath51515% of the average jet speed ) with the faster moving knots being closer to the apex of the bow .",
    "this is in agreement with the observations of micono et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .    fig .  [ h2_em ] shows the emission from the s(1)10 line of h@xmath20 for model g. there is little emission from the cocoon since the cocoon gas has been strongly shocked in the jet shock and so is mostly atomic .",
    "we can also see that the emission becomes more intense as we move away from the apex of the bow shock , as reported by many authors ( e.g.  eislffel et al .",
    "it is also clear that the internal working surfaces in the jet are giving rise to emission in this line .",
    "we can see that the emission begins to die away as we move away from the jet source .",
    "this is in agreement with observations of , for example , hh 46/47 ( eislffel",
    "@xcite ) where the emission from the knots appears close to the jet source and then fades away .",
    "this decrease in emission happens for two reasons .",
    "the first is that the shocks in the jet become weaker as they move away from the source simply because the velocity variations , which give rise to the shocks in the first place , are smoothed out by the shocks ( see , for example whitham ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the mass flux through an individual shock decreases with time due to the divergent nature of the flow ahead of each internal working surface .",
    "this means that the emission will decrease because there is less gas being heated by the shock .",
    "we have found that the so - called ` hubble law ' ( e.g.  lada & fich @xcite ) is reproduced in these simulations .",
    "[ hub_law ] shows a position velocity diagram calculated from simulation g assuming that the jet makes an angle of @xmath49 to the plane of the sky .",
    "this diagram is based on the mass of h@xmath20 rather than intensity of co emission .",
    "there is a gradual , virtually monotonic , rise in the maximum velocity .",
    "it is also worth noting that near the apex of the bow shock the rise in the maximum velocity present becomes steeper .",
    "these properties are related to the shape of the bow shock as gas near the apex of the shock is moving away from the jet axis at higher speed than that far from the apex .    as a very basic model of this , suppose we represent the contact discontinuity between the post - shock jet and ambient gas to be an impermeable body moving with velocity @xmath52 through a fluid whose streamlines will follow the surface of the body . see fig.[schematic ] for a schematic diagram of the system .",
    "let this surface be described by the equation @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the position of the apex of the bow shock on the @xmath56 axis ( see , e.g. , smith et al .",
    "since the contact discontinuity is a streamline of the flow we get that the ratio of the @xmath56-component to the @xmath57-component of the velocity is simply @xmath58^{\\frac{s-1}{s}}\\ ] ] note that this is the negative of the slope of the bow shock .",
    "this is because of our choice of the bow shock pointing to the right , and hence the @xmath56 component of the velocity will be negative . if we assume the post - shock velocity to be @xmath59 ( related to @xmath52 by the shock jump conditions ) , it is simple to show that @xmath60 finally , after some simple algebra , we can write down the velocity along the line of sight as a function of @xmath56 by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the angle the bow shock makes to the plane of the sky .",
    "in fact we can write down @xmath59 if we assume that the bow shock is a strong shock everywhere , thus yielding a compression ratio of 4 ( from the shock conditions ) .",
    "it is easy to derive that @xmath63    this formula yields a shape for the position - velocity diagram which suggests the hubble - law and is similar to diagrams generated from these simulations assuming that the flow is in the plane of the sky .",
    "this indicates that the ` hubble - law ' effect is , at least partly , an artifact of the geometry of the bow shock .      as is clear from fig .",
    "[ tau_mol ] there is not much extra entrainment of ambient gas resulting from the velocity variations .",
    "if the velocity variations were to involve the jet ` switching off ' for a time comparable to the sound crossing time of the cocoon then we would expect ambient gas to move toward the jet axis and probably be driven into the cocoon when the jet switches on again .",
    "this does not happen in these simulations where the maximum period of the variations is 50 yrs and the amplitude is at most 60% of the jet velocity .",
    "however , there is a small amount of acceleration of molecular gas at the left - hand boundary of the grid .",
    "this effect is quite small , but may grow over time .",
    "it is also possible , however , that this effect is due simply to the reflecting boundary conditions .",
    "these simulations show very little mixing between jet and ambient gas except very close to the apex of the bow shock .",
    "this means that the high velocity component of co outflows often observed along the main lobe axis ( bachiller @xcite ) is difficult to explain without invoking the presence of co gas in the jet beam itself just after collimation .",
    "it is now generally agreed that low velocity molecular outflows represent ambient gas that is somehow accelerated by highly collimated and partly ionized jets , at least in the case of low and intermediate mass ysos .",
    "most of this acceleration is thought to be achieved at the head of the jet through the leading bow shock ( the so - called prompt entrainment mechanism ) . in this paper",
    "we have examined through many axially symmetric simulations the efficiency of the prompt entrainment mechanism as a means of transferring momentum to ambient molecular gas without causing dissociation .",
    "it is found , as one would expect , that the fraction of jet momentum transferred to the ambient environment depends on the jet / ambient density ratio .",
    "more importantly , we see that cooling , which is particularly important at higher densities , decreases the fractional jet momentum that goes into _ ambient molecules_. it would seem on the basis of the simulations presented here that both heavy and equal density ( with respect to the environment ) jets with radiative cooling have very low efficiencies at accelerating ambient molecules without causing dissociation . in part",
    "this is because cooled jets have more aerodynamic bow shocks than the corresponding adiabatic ones ( i.e.  they present a smaller cross sectional area to the ambient medium ) .",
    "the actual shape , however , of the bow shock also seems to to be important as the decrease in momentum transferred to the ambient medium seems to affect the acceleration of molecules more so than atoms / ions .",
    "we have also tested whether pulsed jets are more efficient at transferring momentum to the ambient medium than the corresponding steady jet with the same average velocity .",
    "somewhat surprisingly we found that even relatively large velocity variations do not give rise to significant changes in the amount of momentum being deposited in ambient gas .",
    "fundamentally this is because in high mach number jets , even with cooling , there is very little coupling between the jet s cocoon and the `` sheath '' ( i.e.  the post - shock ambient gas ) .",
    "this lack of coupling is also the reason why turbulent entrainment is not significant in yso jets .",
    "our simulations were also used to model the expected variation of mass with velocity in molecular flows .",
    "we found relatively large @xmath1 values , i.e.  mass should decline steeply with velocity , in line with observations .",
    "interestingly we found that a wide shear layer and an increasing molecular component in the jet _ reduced _ @xmath1 . if , as one might expect , such conditions are common among outflows from low luminosity ysos , this could explain their observed lower values for @xmath1 .",
    "finally we have shown that the so - called hubble law for molecular outflows is almost certainly a local effect in the vicinity of a bow shock .",
    "as noted in  [ num_method ] it is common for conservative numerical codes to predict negative pressures under certain conditions .",
    "flows giving rise to such problems are usually highly supersonic , and diverging .",
    "the difficulties occur because the ratio of internal to total energy goes like @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the mach number of the flow .",
    "therefore , in a highly supersonic flow , the fractional error required to predict a negative pressure is rather small .",
    "the introduction of energy losses exacerbates this problem .",
    "this is due to the fact that relatively weakly diverging flows , for example , can become supersonically diverging when the system is cooled because the sound speed is reduced .",
    "schemes which are second order accurate in space tend to produce more negative pressures than first order ones .",
    "this is because first order schemes dissipate strong features quickly so that strongly diverging flows rarely occur .",
    "it seems reasonable , then , to invoke a scheme which is first order in space whenever a negative pressure is produced as this will introduce extra dissipation .",
    "this extra dissipation may eliminate the negative pressure by moving some extra energy from neighbouring cells into the problem one . the scheme used by the code in this work",
    "can be summarised as follows : @xmath66\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the state vector and second order flux calculated at @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively , and @xmath71 .",
    "if this scheme produces a negative pressure at @xmath72 then simply apply eq .",
    "[ scheme ] using the first order fluxes @xmath73 instead of the second order ones .",
    "note that it is necessary to adjust the neighbouring cells also so that overall conservation is maintained .",
    "while this fix does not work for all problems , it was found to be rather effective in the simulations presented here where very strong rarefactions are produced both at the edge of the jet at the @xmath29 boundary , and within the jet itself where the enforced velocity variations can cause problems .",
    "this fix can be implemented very easily by ensuring that the flux vectors around problem cells are stored .",
    "it has the advantage that it does not involve losing conservation of any of the physically conserved quantities .",
    "reducing the scheme to first order in certain regions of the grid is not a significant problem because this happens around shocks anyway in order to maintain monotonicity .",
