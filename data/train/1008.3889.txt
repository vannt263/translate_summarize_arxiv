    "this guarantees coverage of the entire plane . in terms of connectivity ,",
    "note that the nodes within each pair @xmath80 and @xmath81 can communicate directly in both directions . since @xmath82 , both @xmath14 and @xmath15 can see @xmath68 , and @xmath38 can see @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( recall that @xmath66 is the longer side of @xmath76 , therefore @xmath83 is acute , which implies that @xmath38 sees @xmath15 ) .",

    "note that the maximum pairwise distance between nodes in @xmath29 is @xmath93 for the subtree depicted in figure  [ fig : nodegroups]a , and @xmath94 for the subtrees depicted in figure  [ fig : nodegroups](b , c , d ) .",
    "we use theorem  [ thm : fourpoints ] on @xmath29 to determine an orientation of the antennas at nodes in @xmath29 that strongly connects @xmath29 , for @xmath95 .",
    "then @xmath96 enables any node in @xmath29 to reach any hop within unit distance , because the antennas at nodes in @xmath29 collectively cover the entire plane .",
    "the inductive hypothesis is that there is an orientation of antennas at the nodes of @xmath19 consisting of @xmath34 or fewer groups , that satisfies the theorem .",
    "in addition , the inductive hypothesis requires that the root of @xmath19 can reach any hop within a unit distance .",
    "this additional requirement was already established for the base case .    to prove the inductive step , consider a tree @xmath19 with @xmath42 groups .",
    "assume first that the root group contains at least four nodes , so they are arranged in a subtree @xmath97 topologically equivalent to one of the trees from figure  [ fig : nodegroups ] .",
    "as in the base case , we orient the antennas at the representative nodes of @xmath50 as in theorem  [ thm : fourpoints ] , to establish coverage of the plane and strong connectivity between these nodes , for @xmath95 .",
    "for each non - representative node @xmath11 , orient the antenna at @xmath11 to point towards a closest representative node @xmath33 . a simple analysis of the tree topologies from figure  [ fig : nodegroups ] indicate that , in order to establish a connection from @xmath11 to @xmath33 , a radius of @xmath98 for the antenna at @xmath11 suffices for the cases depicted in figure  [ fig : nodegroups](a , d ) , and a radius of @xmath3 suffices for the cases depicted in figure  [ fig : nodegroups](b , c ) . summing up these values with @xmath99 , we obtain that @xmath100 establishes full connectivity between the nodes of @xmath50 ( since one of the nodes in @xmath29 can reach @xmath11 in this case as well ) .",

    "( b ) the root subtree with three nodes ( boxed ) viewed as part of a child subtree . ]",
    "the inductive hypothesis , along with the fact that each child in @xmath19 is within unit distance from its parent , implies that each subtree attached to a node @xmath102 can send messages up to @xmath11 ( see the circular arcs in figure  [ fig:90induction]a ) .",
    "we have established that a setting of @xmath100 enables strong connectivity between the nodes of @xmath50 .",
    "it follows that @xmath101 enables each node @xmath102 to reach each child @xmath33 of @xmath11 , because with this setting at least one of the nodes in @xmath29 can reach @xmath33 ( since their antennas cover the entire plane ) , and @xmath11 can reach any node in @xmath29 .",
