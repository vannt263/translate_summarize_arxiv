    "the modeling of equilibrium figures is one major goal in astrophysics . in the case of compact objects ,",
    "relativistic effects become relevant and it is necessary to treat them using general relativity . exact solutions in this field",
    "are rare , and one is generally required to resort to approximation or numerical methods . a detailed treatment of these issues can be found in meinel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , friedman & stergioulas ( 2013 ) , where the latter includes important discussions of stability .",
    "although it is the numerical approach , with its many possibilities for taking into account the properties of matter , that provides the most accurate means of modeling real astrophysical objects , it is essential that one pursues analytic methods in order to gain deeper insight into the nature of the theory of relativity and how it differs from newtonian theory .",
    "one of the most fruitful avenues of research has always been the treatment of homogeneous matter , where it is precisely the extreme simplification that has permitted great headway . here",
    "we consider one such object , the post - newtonian ( pn ) dedekind ellipsoid , in some depth , since we believe that doing so provides new insights by correcting previous errors and by setting out along a path that may provide new answers concerning the nature of stationary solutions within relativity",
    ".    in newtonian gravity , closed form solutions are known for various ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium including the maclaurin spheroids ( rigidly rotating , axially symmetric , and stationary ) , the tri - axial jacobi ellipsoids ( rigidly rotating , non - axially symmetric , and time independent in a rigidly rotating frame ) , the tri - axial dedekind ellipsoids ( non - axially symmetric and stationary ) , and the tri - axial riemann ellipsoids ( in general : non - axially symmetric and time independent in a rigidly rotating frame ) . for a summary of their properties see @xcite .",
    "the fluids described by these solutions are homogeneous and have a velocity field , which is linear in cartesian coordinates .",
    "moreover , they allow for the ratio of two half axes of the ellipsoid to be adjusted arbitrarily giving rise to one parameter families of solutions . for tri - axial ellipsoids ,",
    "the third semi - axis is uniquely determined by choosing this ratio . the jacobi sequence and the dedekind sequence branch off from the maclaurin sequence thereby allowing an axially symmetric and rigidly rotating limit .    in the search for analogous figures of equilibrium in general relativity ,",
    "there is still much work to do .",
    "however , for all of the aforementioned newtonian families of figures of equilibrium , a post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation was found in the sequence of papers @xcite",
    ". hereafter we call these articles papers i and , if we refer only to the last one , paper ii .",
    "the maclaurin sequence was also studied in @xcite . in the latter paper",
    ", an algorithm was given that allows one to obtain the pn approximation to the maclaurin ellipsoids to arbitrary order .",
    "since the newtonian jacobi ellipsoid has a time dependent quadrupole moment , the energy loss due to gravitational wave emission can be estimated .",
    "this was done in @xcite .",
    "thus , they can not describe figures of equilibrium in general relativity , assuming that the newtonian limit exists .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the non - radiating final state is the maclaurin ellipsoid at the bifurcation point assuming that the jacobi ellipsoids evolve along the jacobi sequence .",
    "similarly , the riemannian ellipsoids also lose energy due to gravitational wave emission .",
    "the irrotational riemann ellipsoids were investigated to 1 pn order in @xcite .",
    "however , the newtonian dedekind ellipsoids are stationary .",
    "although they are non - axially symmetric they keep their form due to internal motion  each fluid element moves along an ellipse in a plane perpendicular to the total angular momentum of the configuration . thus , they are a good starting point to investigate the question if _ stationary but not static relativistic stars are necessarily axially symmetric _ , cf",
    "if dissipative effects are not neglected , it was shown in @xcite that this is always true , but in case of perfect fluids it is still an open question .",
    "before we start deriving pn dedekind ellipsoids , we should state which properties should be satisfied by such a sequence . obviously , they should yield the newtonian dedekind ellipsoids in an appropriate limit , which is guaranteed if they are used as starting point of a pn approximation .",
    "moreover , the pn dedekind ellipsoids should generalize as many properties of the newtonian dedekind ellipsoids as possible .",
    "this includes the reflection symmetry with respect to the coordinate planes and they should approach the 1 pn maclaurin spheroids close to the bifurcation point .",
    "the first property is respected in paper ii but not the second . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that both requirements can be satisfied with a generalization of the ansatz for the 1 pn dedekind ellipsoids of paper ii . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the entire sequence of these figures of equilibrium and discuss their properties .",
    "all 1 pn sequences of figures of equilibrium studied in papers i admit singularities at certain axis ratios .",
    "this implies that in a neighborhood of these points , the 1 pn approximation is not applicable any longer .",
    "interestingly , these singularities along the pn maclaurin and pn jacobi sequences appear at axis ratios , where the newtonian sequence has special properties . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the singularity along the 1 pn maclaurin sequence coincides with the first bifurcation point along the newtonian maclaurin sequence of a sequence of axially symmetric , stationary , rigidly rotating and homogeneous figures of equilibrium . a conjecture stating that all the bifurcation points of such sequences are reflected by a singularity in the pn approximation , cf .",
    "@xcite , was proven in @xcite .",
    "there it was pointed out that , if the bifurcation points are ordered appropriately , then there appears a singularity in the @xmath0th pn order for the @xmath0th bifurcation point .    for the pn jacobi sequence ,",
    "see @xcite , the singularity at the 1 pn order is related to the onset of a fourth - harmonic neutral mode of deformation of the newtonian jacobi ellipsoids ; also here the singularities in the pn approximation of jacobi ellipsoids is intimately tied to physical properties of the newtonian sequence .",
    "however , the axis ratio , where the singularity obtained for the 1 pn dedekind ellipsoids appears in paper ii , could not be identified with a special point along the newtonian sequence by the authors of that paper . with our generalization of the ansatz for the dedekind ellipsoids , see @xcite , we are able to show that this singularity can be removed completely , suggesting that it is only due to an ansatz , which is too restrictive .",
    "surprisingly , chandrasekhar & elbert already considered such a generalization in footnote 2 of paper ii , but discarded it because it was not helpful in curing the singularity in their opinion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will first discuss the newtonian solution . on the one hand , this is done to fix our notation , but will also enable us to motivate certain limits and properties for the 1 pn generalized dedekind ellipsoids .",
    "we will also determine the exterior solution in an explicit form using ellipsoidal harmonics . in section [ sec:1 pnapproach ] ,",
    "we give the field equations for a 1 pn self - gravitating perfect fluid solution .",
    "these are solved for the newtonian dedekind ellipsoids as starting point .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the properties of this 1 parameter family in detail , in particular the singularities in parameter space . some explicit formulae , lengthy calculations , and figures are moved to the appendices for readability .",
    "the newtonian dedekind ellipsoids describe rotating and tri - axial ellipsoids with a homogeneous mass density .",
    "they are stationary in an inertial frame and are solutions to the coupled poisson and euler equations : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the newtonian gravitational potential , @xmath3 the homogeneous mass density ( i.e. , a constant ) and @xmath4 the newtonian velocity of the particles .",
    "the surface of vanishing pressure , i.e. , the surface of the configuration , is that of a tri - axial ellipsoid : @xmath5 we have chosen @xmath6 without loss of generality .",
    "the three axes @xmath7 have to satisfy the relation @xmath8 the index symbols @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , see @xcite , are defined by @xmath12 it is also convenient to define @xmath13    these index symbols satisfy various identities that allow one to express any @xmath9 and @xmath10 as a linear combination of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , see @xcite .",
    "we introduce the dimensionless axis ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the index symbols are homogeneous functions in @xmath18 : @xmath19 the dimensionless index symbols @xmath20 and @xmath21 will be denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "thus , equation in dimensionless form is given by @xmath24 .",
    "it can be solved numerically and determines @xmath25 as a function of @xmath26 independently of @xmath18 ( see @xcite for a table of values for @xmath25 given @xmath26 ) .",
    "hence , the free parameters of this solution are @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath18 and the mass density @xmath3 or , alternatively , the total mass of the configuration @xmath28 .",
    "we further introduce a dimensionless constant @xmath29 and a constant @xmath30 via @xmath31    the solution of equations with a surface given by equations and reads in the interior , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xmath32      several limits are possible in the parameter space of this family of solutions . focusing on the axis ratio @xmath26 , there are the limits @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the latter case",
    ", we have @xmath35 , too . in the first case , the dedekind ellipsoid approaches the maclaurin ellipsoid with @xmath36 marking the well - known bifurcation point along the maclaurin sequence . at this point , both the jacobi and the dedekind ellipsoids branch off . in this limit",
    ", the free parameters @xmath18 and the mass density @xmath3 can be prescribed as an arbitrary function of @xmath26 leading to several qualitatively different possibilities depending on the behavior of these functions .",
    "for instance , if @xmath37 , which implies @xmath38 as well as @xmath39 , and if moreover @xmath40 , then the maclaurin ellipsoids contract to a point particle with mass @xmath41 . in this limit",
    ", the velocity fields vanish as well .",
    "if on the other hand , @xmath42 , which implies @xmath43 , and @xmath3 approaches some value @xmath44 the entire space is filled with a rigidly rotating perfect fluid .",
    "of course , this solution becomes unphysical for radii , where the fluid elements have an orbital velocity greater than the velocity of light . in the limit , where both , @xmath18 and @xmath3 , approach some finite and positive values @xmath45 and @xmath46 , a maclaurin ellipsoid is obtained . here",
    "as well , @xmath45 is restricted by the physical requirement of subluminal motion .",
    "let us turn our attention to @xmath34 . in order to discuss this limit , we shall need to use the following expansions and @xmath47 we have @xmath48 , if @xmath49 .",
    "if the dependent variable is clear from context we drop the index of the landau symbol . ] @xmath50 the expansions of the other index symbols can be inferred from the recursion relations given in @xcite , cf .  the comment after equation .    in the most interesting case , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 implying @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the ellipsoids degenerate to a rod .",
    "then the velocity field of equation always diverges logarithmically , which follows from equations .",
    "in fact , two anti - parallel , non - interacting streams in the @xmath55-direction with infinite velocity emerge such that the solution is static .",
    "the same holds true for the case @xmath56 . in these cases ,",
    "the global solution is not admissible for a pn approximation sufficiently close to the limit @xmath57 . however , if @xmath58 is approached sufficiently fast , the limit describes a newtonian solution that can be interpreted as two anti - parallel streams of massless particles with a finite velocity .",
    "hence , a pn approximation might be possible .",
    "we present the details of this in appendix [ sec : limit_rod ] .    if @xmath59 and @xmath54 , we obtain again a point mass .",
    "if the limit of @xmath60 is sufficiently small for @xmath34 , then the velocity is subluminal during the limiting process .",
    "we describe here the formalism with which the exterior solution of the 1 pn equilibrium figures is obtained in closed form in section [ sec:1 pnapproach ] . as a practical example , we apply the algorithm to the newtonian dedekind ellipsoids .",
    "we introduce ellipsoidal coordinates @xmath61 with @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , see e.g.  @xcite : @xmath65 these coordinates cover the octant @xmath66 , which is sufficient since the problem is reflection - symmetric with respect to the surfaces @xmath67 .",
    "we assume that the pn configuration has this symmetry as well .",
    "the surface of the ellipsoid is characterized by @xmath68 . using these coordinates ,",
    "a separation of variables in the poisson equation with a density @xmath69 the support of which is an ellipsoid is possible .",
    "the solution @xmath70 of @xmath71 will be of the form @xmath72 where the functions @xmath73 are the lam functions of the first kind .",
    "their definition and the first few members of this complete set of functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath74 will be obtained as a solution of the inhomogeneous lam equation @xmath75=\\tilde g_m^n\\left(\\lambda^1\\right)$ ] , where the lam operator @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 the characteristic values @xmath78 of the lam functions are also defined in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath79 are the expansion coefficients of the density @xmath3 with respect to the ellipsoidal harmonics : @xmath80 since @xmath69 vanishes outside of the ellipsoid , the equation becomes homogeneous and the sole solution with the correct asymptotics is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the lam functions of the second kind , see again @xcite .",
    "these follow from the lam functions of the first kind via @xmath83 to the orders , which appear in the present paper , the @xmath84 can be given explicitly in closed form in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "in general , we have to solve the inhomogeneous lam equation .",
    "however , we can rely for all potentials that we have to calculate on a result by @xcite . there",
    "the interior solution of the poisson equation with a density that is polynomial in cartesian coordinates inside an ellipsoid is given .",
    "it is also established that this solution can be connected to an exterior solution , which vanishes at infinity , such that the solution is continuously differentiable everywhere .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath85 for @xmath86 simply by a coordinate transformation of ferrers interior solution from cartesian to ellipsoidal coordinates .",
    "since the interior solution is polynomial in cartesian coordinates , the expansion of this in ellipsoidal surface harmonics @xmath87 terminates at finite order and we can simply read the @xmath74 off .",
    "hence , @xmath88 can afterwards be obtained by @xmath89 and the potential @xmath2 is completely determined .",
    "we illustrate this method for the dedekind ellipsoids , which are of the type considered by @xcite .",
    "the interior solution can be written after a transformation to ellipsoidal coordinates as @xmath90 @xmath91 this implies that the exterior solution has the form @xmath92 where the constants @xmath88 are obtained from equations and .",
    "in fact , this procedure allows us to obtain the exterior solution for mass densities of the form @xmath93 in closed form .",
    "this enables us to determine the 1 pn metric in the exterior region in closed form for the dedekind ellipsoids as well as the jacobi ellipsoids in exactly the same way .",
    "higher order ellipsoidal harmonics will be necessary in this scheme .",
    "however , the calculations are tedious and will not be presented in detail here .",
    "we will only repeat the form of the higher moments in the interior of the ellipsoid , which are the starting point for the straightforward calculations , in appendix [ sec : higher_moments ] .",
    "in @xcite , a set of field equations was discussed whose solutions describe perfect fluids dynamically to first order in @xmath94 in general relativity . in a subsequent series of papers @xcite , solutions to these equations",
    "were constructed using different newtonian configuration as a starting point namely maclaurin ellipsoids , jacobi ellipsoids and dedekind ellipsoids .",
    "although these are all equilibrium figures , the field equations in @xcite allow for non - stationary solutions , too .",
    "thus , one always has to determine and to solve the equations belonging to the dynamical aspects of the fluid .",
    "in contrast , the projection formalism described in @xcite and the field equations derived therein implement the stationarity from the beginning and can be used only in the description of equilibrium figures . in our case , where we are primarily interested in stationary solutions the latter equations are more advantageous especially if one goes to higher pn orders .",
    "however , to the 1 pn order both approaches yield the same result in the case of stationarity ; discrepancies will become apparent only at higher orders . for equations describing higher order pn corrections ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we use the same expansion of the metric as in @xcite : @xmath95 where greek indices run from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , @xmath98 denotes the kronecker delta , @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath2 is the newtonian gravitational potential , which we assume here to be that of a dedekind ellipsoid as discussed in section [ sec : newtonian solution ] .",
    "the contribution @xmath100 is defined momentarily .",
    "the shape of the pn configuration is no longer that of the newtonian ellipsoid @xmath101 ( cf",
    ".  equation ) and we denote it by @xmath102 let us introduce a potential @xmath103 that is a solution of the poisson equation for this perturbed ellipsoid , i.e. , @xmath104 with @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "the symbol @xmath100 in equation is then defined by @xmath107 note that we use the expansion parameter @xmath108 to retain the compatibility with papers i and ii .",
    "however , one could transform the results easily to a more physical expansion parameter , e.g. , @xmath109 .",
    "the pressure and the velocity field are also expanded @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the newtonian velocity is defined as in paper ii and does not refer to the spatial components of the four - velocity @xmath112 , but is instead defined as @xmath113 . ] and @xmath114 is the newtonian pressure , cf .  equations .",
    "we assume that the homogeneous mass density does not change to any pn order .",
    "the 1 pn equations of a self - gravitating perfect fluid read , see @xcite ,    [ eq:1 pn_equations ] @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the square of the newtonian velocity field . since the spatial part of the metric is easily obtained and already incorporated in equation the sole equations that remain to be solved in order to obtain the metric to 1 pn are the first two and the one which determines @xmath100 .",
    "the other equations determine the 1 pn corrections to the pressure , velocity field and the surface .",
    "for the 1 pn correction of the surface we choose the following ansatz    [ eq : ansatz ] @xmath117 and for the velocity @xmath118    in paper ii , both , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , were not considered . in @xcite , we showed that these linear contributions can be used to allow a rigidly rotating axisymmetric limit of the 1 pn dedekind ellipsoids coinciding with the 1 pn maclaurin ellipsoids .",
    "moreover , it seems natural to allow a 1 pn contribution to the newtonian constant @xmath30 analogous to the angular velocity in the case of rigid rotation , see papers i. furthermore , we introduced the constant @xmath121 and @xmath122 compared to paper ii .",
    "the ansatz for the surface is the same as in paper i , i.e. , it originates from a lagrangian displacement of all fluid elements such that the coordinate volume remains constant .",
    "the lagrangian displacement reads , cf .",
    "equation ( 41 ) in paper ii , @xmath123    as was pointed out in @xcite , it is more physical to fix parameters with an immediate physical interpretation like the mass instead the coordinate volume .",
    "however , by following paper ii , it is easier to compare our results with theirs .",
    "as it was discussed in @xcite and in paper ii , an arbitrary contribution to the coordinate volume can be achieved by an additional displacement of the form @xmath124 , whose divergence does not vanish .",
    "alternatively , one can arrive at the same result by considering a different underlying newtonian configuration , i.e. by substituting in our final results @xmath18 by @xmath125 while keeping @xmath26 and @xmath25 fixed .",
    "note that higher order polynomials could also be allowed in the ansatz , which would eventually lead to a homogeneous system for their coefficients .",
    "the form of the solution we use here is the minimal one needed to satisfy the inhomogeneous equations and get a configuration that is dedekind - like in the sense discussed in section [ sec : introduction ] .      in this section",
    ", we will repeat the interior solution for the metric components to an extent that is necessary to construct the exterior solution as well . since the changes in the ansatz do not affect equations and their solutions are the same as obtained in paper ii .",
    "the equations are of the type treated in @xcite , namely they have a polynomial density due to the form of the newtonian solution .",
    "thus , they can be expressed in terms of the higher moments of the homogeneous density @xmath126 , cf .",
    "appendix [ sec : higher_moments ] . with these , the solutions to equations and read @xmath127,\\\\    u_1&=-\\frac{a_1}{a_2 } \\omega   d_2,\\quad u_2=\\frac{a_2}{a_1 } \\omega   d_1,\\\\    u_3&=0 . \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a similar approach can be taken for @xmath100 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath128 cf .",
    "equation ( 58 ) in @xcite , i.e. , as the sum of derivatives of poisson integrals . as such @xmath100 is not continuously differentiable across the surface , which is a problem inherent to this coordinate system .",
    "using surface adapted cartesian coordinates @xmath129 the metric components are continuously differentiable .",
    "but we do not use them here but rather follow paper ii .",
    "the densities in the poisson integrals are polynomial for the lagrangian displacement @xmath130 .",
    "thus , the algorithm described in section [ sec : exterior_solution ] is applicable . taking the derivatives afterwards yields @xmath131 note that only six of the ten third order moments @xmath132 and only the diagonal terms of the second order moments @xmath133 are necessary , cf",

    ", we solve the bianchi identity in equation in the next section .",
    "although the changes in the ansatz will not change the calculations fundamentally , we will describe it in more detail and give also intermediate solutions and analytic expressions .",
    "the main reason is that we were unable to reproduce the numerical data given in paper ii for the case @xmath135 ( see the discussion in @xcite for further details ) .",
    "thus , it might prove helpful for rectifying this discrepancy or at the very least make our calculations repeatable .",
    "the formulae , which are too lengthy for the text here , can be found in appendix [ appendix : explicit_results ] .",
    "inserting our ansatz in the integrability condition for the gradient of the pressure , i.e.  equation , and using the polynomial structure for a comparison of coefficients yields the following solution : @xmath136 thus , the constant @xmath137 is already determined completely and independently of the parameters @xmath138 .    repeating the same for the continuity equation and using the results gives further constraints on the constants @xmath139    a further simplification is achieved by requiring the necessary condition that the normal component of the velocity vanishes at the surface up to 1 pn .",

    "the importance of singularities in 1 pn approximations of equilibrium figures and the issues with the 1 pn dedekind sequence of that paper was discussed in section [ sec : introduction ] .",
    "since we are able to introduce singularities in our 1 pn dedekind solutions at arbitrary points @xmath26 via @xmath162 , it is obvious that not all singularities are necessarily at physically distinguished points . that we can use the @xmath162 to remove the singularity at @xmath163 for _ all _ physical quantities",

    "whose results are obtained by setting @xmath135 , equation could not be satisfied . hence",

    ", higher orders have to be taken into account .",
    "however , as one can readily check numerically , the equation @xmath173 is well - defined in the limit @xmath172 if @xmath174 .",
    "thus , this equation can be used instead of , for instance , @xmath175 .",
    "the resulting coefficient matrix is now regular and the solution finite .",
    "let us introduce instead of @xmath119 a new parameter defined by @xmath176 , where @xmath177 and @xmath120 are arbitrary .",
    "then , the surface coefficients at @xmath170 evaluate to @xmath178 since these parameters enter the velocity field linearly and their coefficients in equations  are well - defined at @xmath164 , the entire solution is regular .",

    ", the angular momentum reads under this constraint @xmath180 in contrast to figure [ fig : angularmomentum ] , this is finite .",
    "equation is not a good parametrization if @xmath34 or @xmath33 . for the axially symmetric limit , a good parametrization close to @xmath181",
    "was discussed in @xcite and the limit @xmath34 is treated in detail in appendix [ sec : limit_rod ] .",
    "these two limits yield additional constraints for @xmath150 in the neighborhood of the respective points that can be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "which shapes can we expect for the 1 pn dedekind ellipsoids if no additional constraints are given ?",
    "the gravitomagnetic effect , i.e. , parallel matter streams repel each other , is already included in a 1 pn approximation .",
    "thus , one should find that the 1 pn dedekind ellipsoid is elongated in the @xmath154-direction compared to the newtonian figure , since all the newtonian streams are along ellipses in the same direction in parallel planes .",
    "this qualitative argument is corroborated by the maclaurin ellipsoids , which are also elongated in this direction close to the bifurcation point , see @xcite .",
    "moreover , the matter streams in the @xmath182-direction for @xmath183 are all parallel and anti - parallel to those in @xmath184 .",
    "the latter are on average at a larger distance .",
    "thus , the repulsive effect should prevail and in this direction too we have an elongation . in the @xmath55-direction , a similar argument holds .",
    "which effect is stronger , the repulsion in the @xmath182-direction or in the @xmath55-direction , depends on the choice of @xmath138 .",
    "however , this conclusion disregards the pressure entirely and can only provide a rough idea for the resulting 1 pn shape .",
    "more importantly , the lagrangian displacement yields a vanishing 1 pn contribution to the coordinate volume and , thus , it does not allow for an elongation of the ellipsoid in all directions .",
    "in fact , we always observe elongations in the @xmath154-direction , and deformation in the other directions can be adjusted with different choices of the @xmath138 .",
    "the three qualitatively different case are depicted in figure [ fig : surface ] in appendix [ appendix : solution_plotted ] .      to explicate the inner motion of the 1 pn dedekind ellipsoids , we integrated the velocity field of the fluid numerically and discuss here the trajectories of a generic fluid element . in the newtonian dedekind ellipsoid , all fluid elements move along ellipses that are in planes with constant @xmath154 .",
    "the time of revolution coincides for all fluid elements . in the 1 pn approximation to these figures of equilibrium ,",
    "the trajectories are distorted ellipses that are still closed and the motion is not any longer confined to planes with constant @xmath154 .",
    "the latter follows directly from our ansatz in equation .",
    "the velocity in the @xmath154-direction vanishes at the coordinate planes so that no fluid element moves from the upper half of the 1 pn ellipsoid ( @xmath185 ) to the lower ( @xmath186 ) and vice versa .",
    "it also changes sign when the particle crosses the other coordinate planes .",
    "moreover , the motion in the @xmath154-direction is periodic with half the time of revolution as period .",
    "furthermore , the time of revolution of the fluid elements depends now on the starting point .",
