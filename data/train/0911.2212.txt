    "this is a continuing study of the narrow - line region ( hereafter nlr ) of the seyfert galaxy ngc4151 using data obtained with the gemini near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) .",
    "the data comprise spectra of the inner@xmath12pc@xmath13 , at a spatial resolution of@xmath14pc at the galaxy , covering the wavelength range@xmath15@xmath16 m at a spectral resolving power r@xmath17 . in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paperi ) we have used these data to map the nlr intensity distributions of @xmath18 emission lines , as well as their ratios .",
    "the main results were the distinct flux distributions and physical properties observed for the ionised , molecular and coronal gas .",
    "the ionised gas is co - spatial with the ionisation bi - cone observed in the optical ]  emission at position angle ( hereafter pa)@xmath19 @xcite , and seems to trace the outflow along the bi - cone @xcite . in the inner region",
    ", the nir ionised - gas emission extends beyond the borders of the cone , which does not have a sharp apex as noted also by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath20  molecular gas intensity distribution , on the other hand , avoids the region of the bi - cone and seems to originate in the galaxy disc , while the coronal gas emission is barely resolved . in another recent work @xcite",
    ", we have studied the unresolved nuclear continuum showing that its origin is emission by hot dust within @xmath44pc from the nucleus  as expected from the dusty torus postulated by the unified model @xcite .",
    "the origin of this structure is probably a dusty wind that originates in the outer parts of the accretion disk .",
    "this wind is probably clumpy , as suggested by recent models @xcite , and necessary in order to allow the escape of radiation along the equatorial plane of the bi - cone in order to ionize the gas and produce the observed flux maps of paperi .    in the present paper",
    "we use the nifs data to map the nlr kinematics of ngc4151 .",
    "although many papers have been devoted to such a study , most of them are based on long - slit spectroscopy obtained in the optical with the hubble space telescope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the present study was performed in the near - ir , a waveband which is less affected by dust , and using integral field spectroscopy , which allows a full two - dimensional ( hereafter 2d ) coverage of the nlr kinematics . with our data and analysis",
    "we aim to examine previous claims of acceleration of the gas along the nlr , quantify the mass outflow rate and the corresponding feedback power , as well as investigate the origin of the nlr gas . as ngc4151 harbors the closest bright agn ,",
    "its nlr is one of the best suited for this type of study .",
    "our approach for the analysis of the nlr kinematics of ngc4151 is as follows .",
    "first we map the centroid velocity and velocity dispersion of the ionised , molecular and coronal gas , obtained from fits to the emission - line profiles and compare our results with those of previous studies .",
    "then we use an alternative approach to map the nlr kinematics , made possible by integral field spectrographs : a `` velocity tomography '' of the emitting gas , obtained by slicing the line profiles in velocity bins of@xmath21kms@xmath6 , producing channel maps which provide a clearer view of the velocity distribution in the different gas phases .",
    "we have grouped the channel maps together in a sequence of velocity bins , generating movies which can be recovered at the authors website.thaisa/ifu_movies/ngc4151 ]    we adopt in this paper the same distance to ngc4151 as in paperi:@xmath22mpc , corresponding to a scale at the galaxy of@xmath23pcarcsec@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in  [ data ]",
    "we provide a quick description of the data , in  [ results ] we present the centroid velocity and velocity dispersion measurements , in  [ tomography ] we present the emission - line `` tomography '' , in  [ discussion ] we discuss our results , in  [ feed ] we estimate the mass outflow rate along the nlr and compare with the mass accretion rate and in  [ conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the observations comprise three pointings obtained with the gemini north telescope with the nifs instrument @xcite operating with the altair adaptive optics module , each covering a square field of view of@xmath24arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "one of the nifs fields was centred on the ngc4151 nucleus and the others were offset by@xmath25arcsec along position angle@xmath26 , resulting in a total field of view of@xmath27arcsec@xmath13 , with the longest extent oriented approximately along the radio jet @xcite .",
    "the spectra cover the z , j , h , and k spectral bands at two - pixel resolving powers of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the angular resolution , as determined from the fwhm of the psf , ranges from @xmath31arcsec in the h and k spectral bands to @xmath32arcsec in the z and j bands .",
    "this corresponds to a spatial resolution at the galaxy of @xmath33 pc at h and k bands , and @xmath34pc in the z and j bands .",
    "more details about the data and the data reduction can be found in paperi , as well as flux measurements of 61 emission lines from three characteristic locations along the nlr . in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the kinematics measured for the strongest emission lines of the ionised and molecular gas , namely : ] @xmath35 m , @xmath36 m , ] @xmath37 m , pa@xmath38@xmath39",

    "we have also measured the kinematics for the coronal lines of ] @xmath42 m and ] @xmath43 m .",
    "we first present and discuss the centroid velocity and velocity dispersion maps and then present the velocity tomography .",
    "centroid velocity and velocity dispersion  ( @xmath44 ) maps were obtained by fitting gaussians to the emission - line profiles .",
    "the velocities were obtained from the central wavelength of the gaussians ( after subtraction of the systemic velocity of @xmath45kms@xmath6 , and applying a heliocentric correction of @xmath46kms@xmath6 ) while the velocity dispersions were obtained from the full width at half maximum ( hereafter fwhm ) of the gaussians as @xmath47fwhm@xmath48 .    in many locations along the nlr of ngc4151 , the strongest ionised gas emission lines ",
    "those of ]  and   show two kinematic components , with a mean velocity separation between them ranging from @xmath49 to @xmath50kms@xmath6 .",
    "we were successful in fitting two gaussian components to both these lines , although the  line has a broad component and a nuclear absorption component which introduces uncertainties in the fitting procedure for regions close to the nucleus .",
    "in a few regions , we observe double components also in ] , pa@xmath38 , and br@xmath51 .",
    "elsewhere , these lines are broader at locations where double components are observed in ]  and . this suggests that the ] , pa@xmath38 , and br@xmath51   emission lines are also double . the lower signal - to - noise ratio ( hereafter s / n ) of these lines , the presence of a broad component for the  emission - lines close to the nucleus , and the fact that the ]  emission line appears to be intrinsically broader contribute to blend together two distinct kinematic components .",
    "double components have been previously observed in the ] @xmath52  emission - line profiles by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "@xcite using higher resolution ( r@xmath53 ) spectra , showed that in some locations there are even three or four components .",
    "our lower spectral resolution did not allow us to resolve more than two components .",
    "typical fits to the ]  emission - line profile are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - profile ] , corresponding to locations ( a , b , c , d and e ) identified in the ]  radial velocity maps which are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - doublevel ] . because the s / n is not high enough to allow the fit of each component with the necessary number of free parameters , we had to constrain the width of the two gaussian components to the same value .",
    "the implication of this assumption is that there will be some uncertainty in the gas kinematics derived in this way , mainly in the velocity dispersions , as discussed bellow .",
    "although in the next section we derive the kinematics in terms of channel maps , with no assumptions , we decided to include the kinematics in terms of two components in order to be able to compare our results with those of previous studies , in which this was the method used to derive the gas kinematics .",
    "in addition , the separation in two components helps in the identification of the origin of the gas emission .            in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ f - doublevel ] we show velocity maps in the emission lines of ]  and  of regions with one kinematic component , after subtraction of the systemic velocity . in the middle and bottom panels we show the velocity maps of the regions with two kinematic components : the middle panel shows the high velocity component , corresponding to negative ( blueshifted ) velocities to the sw and positive ( redshifted ) velocities to the ne , while the bottom panel shows the low velocity component .    for the ]  emission , the lowest velocities are observed along the galaxy minor axis ( pa@xmath54 ) in the upper panel of fig.[f - doublevel ] ( single component ) , and in neighboring locations where two components were fit to the data .",
    "this low velocity component , essentially at zero velocity , probably originates in the galaxy disc , while the redshifted and blueshifted velocity components originate in the outflow along the bi - cone .",
    "the highest blueshifts are observed in the bottom part of the strip labelled  c \" in the middle left panel of fig.[f - doublevel ] , while the highest redshifts are observed in the region labelled  b \" .    in order to better illustrate the magnitude of the velocity variations , and to investigate further the origin of the different gas components , we show in fig .",
    "[ f - pv ] the velocities as a function of distance from the nucleus along pa@xmath55 .",
    "the black dots represent the single components and the red dots represent the double components , while the labels allow the comparison with fig.[f - doublevel ] .",
    "[ f - pv ] suggests the presence of a @xmath4 zero velocity component observed between @xmath56 and @xmath57 from the nucleus along pa@xmath58 , whose origin is probably the galaxy plane , as pointed out above . then there is a sequence of blueshifts at @xmath59kms@xmath6  to the sw ( positive distances in fig.[f - pv ] ) which probably originates in the far side of the approaching cone ( see fig.[f - geom ] and discussion in sec.[geom ] ) .",
    "a similar sequence of redshifts at somewhat lower velocities , up to @xmath60kms@xmath6  to the ne can be identified with the near side of the receding cone .",
    "the highest blueshifts to the sw and highest redshifts to the ne can then be identified with the near side of the approaching cone and the far side of the receding cone , respectively .",
    "these highest velocities thus originate in the walls of the bi - cone that are most inclined relative to the line - of - sight .",
    "velocity dispersion ( @xmath44 ) maps of the ]  and  emission lines for the single and two - component fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - doublesig ] .",
    "we note again that the measured velocity dispersions are upper limits to the intrinisic gas velocity dispersion in regions where a single gaussian component has been fit , possibly to multiple unresolved components .",
    "for example , in region e in fig .",
    "[ f - doublesig ] , the velocity dispersion is @xmath2150kms@xmath6 . but this large velocity dispersion is probably due to the blending of at least two components , as it surrounds a region with two components ( region d ) .",
    "similarly , the measured values are only indicative of the gas velocity dispersion in regions where two components have been fit , as their widths have been constrained to the same value .",
    "this is the case of region e , where there are a component at zero velocity and a blueshifted component , which do not necessary have the same velocity dispersion .",
    "nevertheless , these @xmath44 values should not be too far off because they are of the order of the @xmath44 value of the zero velocity single component along the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "the lowest @xmath44 values for the single components are @xmath0 100kms@xmath6 .",
    "these are seen mostly along the minor axis of the galaxy .",
    "the low velocity dispersion suggests that the emitting gas in these regions is not disturbed and probably lies close to the galaxy plane . the velocity dispersion is larger in other regions",
    "this could be due to turbulence caused by the outflow or to multiple velocity components .",
    "the @xmath44 values for the double components are in some regions ( e.g. region  d \" ) almost as low as the lowest values of the single components , suggesting that at least one of the components originates in the galaxy plane .",
    "regions of higher @xmath44 values in the two components are those labelled ",
    "b \"  in the ne outflow  and the bottom part of the strip  c \" , where the highest blueshifts are seen in the centroid velocity maps , supporting an origin in the front side of the sw cone , as discussed above .    the centroid velocity distribution of h@xmath20  emission lines is dominated by velocities close to systemic .",
    "this emission is concentrated along the minor axis of the galaxy , whose orientation approximately coincides with that of the galaxy bar .",
    "there are some redshifts to the ne mainly along the galaxy major axis and some blueshifts to the sw along both the galaxy major axis and the cone axis ( see fig.[f - chmh2 ] ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions are mostly constant at @xmath480kms@xmath6 supporting an origin for this gas in the galaxy plane .",
    "the coronal line flux distributions are just barely resolved and their centroid velocities are also close to systemic , while their velocity dispersions are @xmath4100kms@xmath6 .",
    "we have also mapped the gas kinematics by integrating the fluxes within wavelength slices extracted along the emission - line profiles corresponding to velocity bins of @xmath61kms@xmath6 .",
    "these  channel maps \" display the distributions of the gas emission at different velocities , which occur at different depths along the line of sight . in this sense , they can be described as velocities  tomography \" of the nlr using emission - line scanning .",
    "the channel maps are shown in figs .",
    "[ f - chmsiii ] , [ f - chmfeii ] , [ f - chmbrg ] and [ f - chmh2 ] for the emission lines of ] , ] , br@xmath51  and h@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "channel maps in the other ionised gas emission lines , such as  and pa@xmath38 , are similar to those in ]  and thus are not shown here .",
    "the lowest flux shown in the channel maps is @xmath62 times the root mean square variation of the surrounding sky flux . the bi - cone axis at pa@xmath55 as determined by @xcite",
    "is represented by a dashed line in the figures , while the major axis of the galaxy at pa@xmath63 is represented by a continuous line .",
    "the contours of a radio merlin image ( kindly made available by c. mundell ) have been overplotted on the central velocity bins ( velocities close to systemic ) .                    in the channel maps of the ]  emission line , shown in fig .",
    "[ f - chmsiii ] , the most blueshifted gas at @xmath64kms@xmath6  lies very close to the nucleus . for blueshifts of @xmath65kms@xmath6",
    "the emission extends further out , and for lower velocities broadens in the shape of a projected cone extending from the bi - cone axis towards the galaxy major axis . at the slice corresponding to @xmath66kms@xmath6  there seems to be a spatial association between the line emission and the radio structure .",
    "in particular , both of them broaden towards the major axis . at velocities close to zero , and up to redshifts",
    "@xmath67kms@xmath6 , the emission is extended in all directions around the nucleus , evidencing the absence of a sharp cone apex .",
    "the largest elongation of this emission occurs along the horizontal axis , which is approximately the orientation of the radio axis .",
    "the overplotted radio contours show that , although there is not a detailed correspondence between the ]  and radio image , the brightest regions of the ]  image coincide with the two inner knots of the radio image . for redshifts larger than @xmath68kms@xmath6 ,",
    "the gas is observed mostly to the ne in the opposite direction to that of the blueshifted gas , showing also a similar flux distribution : for the lowest redshifts the emission is distributed in a fan structure extending from the major axis of the galaxy to the bi - cone axis , while for the intermediate and the highest redshifts the emission is more elongated and concentrated closer to the bi - cone axis to the ne .",
    "channel maps for the ]  emission line are shown in fig .",
    "[ f - chmfeii ] . in the high - velocity blueshifted channels",
    ", this emission seems to be more collimated along the bi - cone axis than for other emission lines .",
    "some blueshifts from @xmath69kms@xmath6  to zero velocity are observed also to the ne , unlike the slices in the other emission lines .",
    "the flux distributions for velocities close to zero and redshifted gas are similar to those in ] , although the highest redshifts are as high as the highest blueshifts and are observed up to similar distances from the nucleus . in all velocity channels , there seems to be more structure in ]   than in ] , in the form of knots of emission in closer association with the radio knots .",
    "this is particularly clear at the velocity bins from @xmath69 to @xmath70kms@xmath6 : at @xmath66kms@xmath6  the strongest emission traces the `` flaring '' of the radio structure to sw towards the galaxy major axis ; between velocities of @xmath71 and @xmath72kms@xmath6 , the strongest emission approximately traces the two central radio knots and , for higher redshifts , there is an enhancement of the ]  emission at @xmath73arcsec ne , at the location of another radio knot .",
    "fig.[f - chmbrg ] shows the channel maps in the br@xmath51  emission line .",
    "these show similar morphologies to those seen in ] , but with more structure .",
    "this can be attributed , at least in part , to the better spatial resolution achieved by the adaptive optics system in the k band relative to the z band .",
    "the channel maps in the h@xmath20  emission line , shown in fig .",
    "[ f - chmh2 ] , are completely different from those of the ionised gas , in support of a distinct origin for the molecular gas , as already pointed out in .",
    "most of the emission occurs in the @xmath0 zero velocity channels .",
    "a small excess of blueshifts to the sw ( from @xmath74kms@xmath6 ) and similar redshifts to the ne suggest rotation around the minor axis .",
    "the flux distributions show a hollow core around the nucleus , and beyond this region the emission surrounds the minor axis of the galaxy in the shape of two arcs extending up to @xmath75arcsec to nw and se of the nucleus .",
    "a comparison with the channel maps in the ionised gas at the same velocity bins ( around zero velocity ) shows that the molecular gas emission avoids the innermost region of ionised gas , and the hollow structure can thus be explained by the presence of ionised gas surrounding the nucleus at zero velocity .",
    "in the centroid velocity maps for the ionised gas emission ( fig.[f - doublevel ] ) , the lowest velocities are observed at the nucleus , while the highest are observed away from the nucleus .",
    "this is the case for ngc4151 and also for 6 other seyfert galaxies for which we have recently obtained kinematic data with the ifu of the gemini multi - objetct spectrograph ( gmos ) @xcite .",
    "the channel maps , on the other hand , show a different behavior : the highest velocities are usually observed at the nucleus @xcite . in the case of ngc4151 , blueshifts of @xmath76kms@xmath6  in ]  and ]   are observed at the nucleus and in a narrow region along the bi - cone axis extending from the nucleus almost to the outer edge of the nlr ( figs .",
    "[ f - chmsiii ] and [ f - chmfeii ] ) .",
    "lower velocity blueshifted gas appears to fill the bi - cone and extend into the region of the radio jet near the systemic velocity .",
    "a similar structure is seen in redshifted gas with the emission at moderate redshifts appearing to fill the receding bi - cone .",
    "emission at the highest redshifts of @xmath77kms@xmath6  occurs at the nucleus and in a localised region @xmath0 0@xmath109 to the ne of the nucleus that is offset from the bi - cone axis .",
    "this morphology differs from that of the highest velocity blueshifted gas and may simply reflect the clumpy nature of the nlr emission .",
    "we attribute the difference between the kinematics probed by the centroid velocity and channel maps to the fact that the centroid velocity probes the brightest emission , while the channel maps also probe fainter emission ( in the wings of the line profiles ) . in the vicinity of the nucleus",
    "the brightest component is the one originating in the galactic disc , while away from the nucleus the brightest component is the outflowing one . as a consequence ,",
    "the centroid velocities show an apparent increase in velocity outwards , that mimics acceleration along the nlr . in the channel maps we see high velocity gas at the nucleus , showing that the outflow does not leave the nucleus at zero velocity .",
    "we interpret this high velocity gas as an outflowing wind from the agn or ambient gas more directly interacting with this wind .",
    "as this highest velocity gas moves away from the nucleus , it pushes and accelerates the gas from the disc .",
    "the small amount of high velocity gas thus transfers momentum to a large reservoir of low velocity gas from the disc , causing the observed emission - line profiles and velocity structure along the bi - cone .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the one proposed by @xcite who , after verifying the failure of various wind models to reproduce the observed outflows in ngc4151 , suggested that the interaction of an outflowing nuclear wind with the ism could explain the observed velocity profile .",
    "some of the previous studies of the nlr of ngc4151 have suggested that there is no relation between the radio jet and the bi - conical outflow @xcite .",
    "the distinct orientations of the two outflows do support distinct origins for them : the radio jet ( oriented at pa@xmath475@xmath3 ) originates in the funnel of the accretion disc , while the bi - conical outflow originates further out , probably still in the accretion disc .",
    "the disc should also be warped , in order to produce a wind with a distinct orientation ( pa=60@xmath3 ) from that of the radio jet .",
    "the channel maps of figs .",
    "[ f - chmsiii ] , [ f - chmfeii ] and [ f - chmbrg ] confirm that the flux distributions at high velocities show no relation with the radio jet .",
    "but at velocities close to systemic the flux distributions become oriented along the radio axis instead of along the bi - cone .",
    "in addition , a comparison between the channel maps for velocities close to systemic and the contours of the radio map reveals line flux enhancements at the locations of radio knots .",
    "our proposed interpretation is that the radio jet has been launched close to the plane of the galaxy , and does interact with the circumnuclear gas pushing it out approximately along the plane and introducing the flux enhancements mostly due to gas density enhancement which are observed at velocities close to systemic .",
    "the observed flux enhancements could also be due to extra ionization by shock - induced x - rays in the nlr clouds interacting with the jet .",
    "recent chandra x - ray observations of the nlr of ngc4151 @xcite have shown extended emission along the nlr with x - ray flux enhancements in association with radio knots .",
    "they show that the radio - jet parameters are only consistent with the x - ray flux beeing due to thermal emission associated with the radio jet .",
    "the presence of shock heating is supported by the results of paperi , namely the increase of the [ feii]1.257/[pii ] line ratio to values larger than @xmath42 in association with the radio knots .",
    "values larger than @xmath42 imply the presence of fast shocks to destroy dust grains and release the fe .",
    "we also find , in paperi , a high temperature (  16 000k ) in the flux - enhanced regions , as derived from the [ feii ] line ratios , in agreement with this scenario . in the channel maps ,",
    "the relation of the gas emission with the radio jet seems also to be strongest for ] , as can be observed in fig .",
    "[ f - chmfeii ] : at velocities from @xmath78 to @xmath79kms@xmath6 , there is enhanced ]  emission at the locations of most radio knots",
    ". there seems also to be an association between a `` flared structure '' to the sw observed in the radio map with the line emission at velocities of up to @xmath80kms@xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the radio jet has been deflected towards the line - of - sight at this location .",
    "some spatial association between optical and radio emission in the nlr of ngc4151 has also been observed by @xcite .",
    "comparing high resolution radio images to an hst ]  image , they found a number of bright ]  clouds that seem to bound a number of knots observed in the radio image , which they interpret are due to shocks of the radio jet with the circumnuclear ism as the jet moves through the nlr and encounters gas clouds .",
    "@xcite studied the ]  kinematics of the nlr of the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy , ngc1068 , using a long - slit spectrum obtained at pa 202  with stis on hst .",
    "they found a distribution of line centroid velocities along the slit that resembled a `` figure of eight '' , with prominent high - velocity redshifted and blueshifted emission clumps and relatively few low - velocity clouds at intermediate distances from the nucleus .",
    "this distribution led them to infer a highly inclined conical geometry for the nlr of ngc1068 , with the emission arising from clouds outflowing radially along the cone walls .",
    "the cloud outflow velocities increase approximately linearly with radial distance on both sides of the nucleus to @xmath81kms@xmath6  at distances of @xmath82arcsec from the nucleus , and then decline back to zero by @xmath83arcsec .",
    "@xcite were forced to hypothesise a gradual acceleration of the nlr clouds over @xmath84pc followed by gradual deceleration to @xmath85pc to account for this velocity structure .",
    "@xcite used a more extensive set of stis spectra to develop this model for ngc1068 further .",
    "@xcite applied the same model to stis spectra of the nlr of ngc4151 .",
    "the nlr of ngc4151 is far less inclined to the line of sight than ngc1068 ",
    "@xcite infer @xmath86 compared to @xmath87 for ngc1068  so radial flows along the cone walls do not separate as cleanly into high - velocity redshifted and blueshifted structures .",
    "consequently , the fit to the ngc4151 data is less compelling than for ngc1068 .",
    "@xcite revisited the ngc4151 nlr kinematics by fitting a similar model to spectra from five adjacent stis slit positions .",
    "their comprehensive analysis provides strong evidence that the nlr of ngc4151 is inclined by @xmath88 to the line of sight , with a hollow bi - conical outflow occupying cone half - angles between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "@xcite conclude that the outflow along the walls of the bi - cone is best reproduced with a velocity law : @xmath91 valid for distances @xmath92 from the nucleus up to a turnover point at @xmath93pc ( @xmath94 ) , from where the gas starts to decelerate and reaches the systemic velocity at @xmath95pc ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the sw side of the bi - cone is tilted toward us , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f - geom ] . in this geometry and orientation",
    ", we view the nucleus just outside the outer wall , at an angle of @xmath97 with respect to the nearest part of the sw cone .",
    "this geometry and orientation has led to the idea that we see ngc4151 as a seyfert 1 galaxy because the blr can be viewed directly through a clumpy medium defining the cone walls .",
    "the angle between the bi - cone axis and the normal to the galaxy disk is @xmath98 @xcite , and thus , for a total opening angle of the bi - cone of @xmath99 , one side of the cone exits the galactic disk steeply , with the outer wall making an angle of 87@xmath3 with the galaxy plane , while the other outer wall leaves the plane at only 21@xmath3 , impacting a larger area of the disk ( for a typical scale height for the disc of several tens of pc ) , as illustrated in fig.[f - geom ] .",
    "@xcite argue that the intersection of the cone with the disc produces the observed geometry of the extended narrow - line region as shown by @xcite .",
    "if we now inspect our centroid velocity maps of fig .",
    "[ f - doublevel ] and fig.[f - pv ] in light of the geometry proposed by @xcite , we conclude that , in most regions where we see two velocity components , there is always one component at the systemic velocity plus an outflowing component in blueshift to the sw and in redshift to the ne .",
    "we attribute the systemic velocity component to emitting gas from the galaxy disc , in which case we are led to the conclusion that the agn ionizes a region of the galaxy disc comparable in extent to that of the outflowing gas emission we detect along the bi - cone axis ( @xmath415 , or @xmath4100pc ) and somewhat less extended perpendicular to it ( @xmath41 , or @xmath465pc ) .",
    "blueshifted components are observed to the sw at @xmath100kms@xmath6  and at higher velocities of up to @xmath5kms@xmath6  ( fig.[f - doublevel ] for ]  and fig.[f - pv ] ) .",
    "we interpret the component with blueshifts @xmath100kms@xmath6  at the position labelled _ d _ in fig.[f - doublevel ] , together with the single component surrounding it ( region _ e _ in fig.[f - doublevel ] ) , as originating in the back surface of the sw cone . in the bottom part of the region we labelled _ c _ in fig.[f - doublevel ] , we observe a few points with higher blueshifts of up to @xmath5kms@xmath6  ( see also fig.[f - pv ] ) .",
    "these components probably originate in the front part of the sw cone , which we see at a small angle ( @xmath97 ) and thus with a large velocity component along the line - of - sight .",
    "there is less emission from this front part of the sw cone than from the back , and our hypothesis to explain this is that the cone walls are formed by gas entrained from the galaxy disk .",
    "the front wall is thus likely to be comprised of more tenuous gas than the back wall , as there is less gas to be entrained at high angles to the galactic disk .",
    "redshifted components are observed to the ne at somewhat lower velocities than to the sw ( region labelled _",
    "b _ in fig.[f - doublevel ] ) .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in fig.[f - pv ] : there is a sequence of redshifts of up to @xmath60kms@xmath6 , which can be attributed to the front of the ne cone and then some higher redshifts of up to 400500kms@xmath6 , which can be attributed to the back of the ne cone . in fig.[f - doublevel ] , there is more emission from gas at the highest redshifts than emission from gas at the highest blueshifts .",
    "this result , together with the lower redshifts to the ne than blueshifts to the sw , suggest that the ne cone has its axis somewhat tilted towards the line of sight , instead of being aligned with the axis of the sw cone .",
    "this tilt would allow us to see more of the back wall of the ne cone and would result in lower observed velocities for both its front and back walls .    in the model proposed by @xcite , the nlr",

    "the gradual acceleration over the inner @xmath101pc and then deceleration required by the model remain unexplained .",
    "@xcite noted that radiative and magnetic acceleration from the region of the accretion disk both accelerate gas on length scales of the order of the launch radius , so winds driven by these mechanisms should reach their terminal velocities by @xmath102pc from the central source , not the @xmath103pc required by the model fits to the data .",
    "thermal winds also fail in this regard @xcite .",
    "dynamical models including various acceleration and deceleration mechanisms have been developed @xcite . while these models fail to identify the acceleration mechanism",
    ", they do demonstrate that gravitational forces alone can not produce the required deceleration , while drag forces from the interaction of nlr clouds with a diffuse , hot , x - ray - emitting ambient medium could be responsible .",
    "the difficulty in identifying a suitable wind acceleration mechanism leads to the question of whether some of the nlr kinematics are due to gradual global wind acceleration or whether they result from the local interaction of an already accelerated wind with its ambient medium , as we have proposed above on the basis of the channel maps .",
    "this scenario has been proposed by @xcite , who realised that the interaction of an outflowing nuclear wind with the ism could reproduce the apparent acceleration of the nlr following the works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors showed that a protostellar hydromagnetic wind expanding into the surrounding gas produces a bipolar outflow with velocity proportional to the distance to the star until a maximum radius beyond which the gas starts to decelerate .      in order to be able to compare our data with those of previous works ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) ,",

    "another significant difference between the model and the near - infrared pv data is that the model predicts that pseudo - slits offset from the nucleus will show no emission near the slit centre  fig .",
    "[ f - daspv ] .",
    "this is the equatorial region away from the nucleus and between the two oppositely - directed cone `` lobes '' .",
    "most of the actual emission at off - nucleus slit positions arises in this region that is excluded by the model ",
    "c.f . , fig .",
    "[ f - pvfeii ] .",
    "there is also emission at zero velocity  mainly observed in the ]  pv diagram which is not included in the model .    finally , the model predicts that the channel maps should show ridges of emission perpendicular to the cone axis at high positive and negative velocities  fig .",
    "[ f - daschm ] .",
    "this morphology arises because outflowing material in the hollow cone essentially emits from an annular region perpendicular to the cone axis ",
    "convolved with other orientation factors .",
    "in contrast , the channel maps in figs .",
    "[ f - chmsiii ] and [ f - chmfeii ] show that the highest - velocity emission is confined to positions close to the cone axis , and is possibly extended along the cone axis towards the nucleus .",
    "we now investigate modifications to the hollow - cone , radial - outflow model that attempt to address the above differences .",
    "the simplest modification is to hypothesise that the cone wall that is steeply inclined to the plane of the sky does not emit strongly in near - infrared lines .",
    "this could occur because this cone wall is more inclined to the galactic disk . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ centroid ] , under the hypothesis that the cone walls are formed by gas entrained from the galaxy disk , this wall is likely to be comprised of more tenuous gas , as there is less gas to be entrained at high angles to the galactic disk .",

    "the pv diagrams in fig.[f - modpv ] do not provide a perfect fit to the data ( in particular to the highest spatial resolution ]  data in fig.[f - pvfeii ] ) .",
    "however , they serve to illustrate the following points : firstly , the emission from the cone ( blue regions in fig.[f - modpv ] ) is a better fit to the data in the linear plots ( showing the strongest emitting gas ) if only the section of the cone wall closest to the plane of the sky , and hence closest to the galactic disk , is included . this may be due to interaction of the nlr gas in the cone wall with the galactic disk , possibly by the entrainment of disk material into the nlr outflow . given that this material is moving in a direction closer to the plane of the sky , we are less sensitive to its true velocity so can not make strong claims about the length scale on which it is accelerated .",
    "fig.[f - modpv ] is drawn for the gradual acceleration and subsequent deceleration proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , the data permit virtually any velocity law , including constant velocity outflow , on the length scales to which they are sensitive . the second point illustrated by fig.[f - modpv ]",
    "is that emission from gas interaction with the radio jet is significant .",
    "this is modeled as nuclear and off - nuclear clumps , but in reality other emitting gas forms a bridge between the main clumps and the nucleus .",
    "this is seen in the channel maps shown in fig.[f - chmfeii ] .",
    "finally , the galaxy component at systemic velocity reproduces the data at pa=60@xmath3 for pseudo - slits at negative offsets and at pa@xmath136for pseudo - slits at positive offsets , supporting the presence of a disc component , as concluded also from the centroid velocity maps of fig.[f - doublevel ] .",
    "simulated channel maps are shown in fig.[f - modchm ] .",

    "the mass outflow rate can be compared with the accretion rate to feed the supermassive black hole .",
    "the accretion rate can be estimated from :    @xmath189    where @xmath190 is the speed of light , and the bolometric luminosity is @xmath191ergs@xmath6 @xcite , which is 0.012 times the eddington luminosity for a black hole mass of @xmath192m@xmath8 @xcite . for this eddington ratio",
    "we adopt an efficiency factor for the conversion of rest mass energy into radiation of @xmath193 , a typical value for an optically thin geometrically thick accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath194yr@xmath6 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the mass outflow rate , indicating that the origin of the outflowing gas is not the agn but could be surrouding gas from the galaxy ism accelerated by a nuclear outflow , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "our data also allows us to estimate the kinetic power of the outflow , including both the radial and turbulent components of the gas motion . assuming that the velocity dispersion of the hii emitting gas is due to turbulence , the kinetic power can be estimated as :    @xmath195    from fig .",
    "[ f - doublesig ] we obtain @xmath196kms@xmath6 , and adopting as above , @xmath197kms@xmath6and using @xmath198 ( considering the outflows in both cones ) , we obtain @xmath9ergs@xmath6 , which is @xmath199l@xmath200 . thus , from the power that can be extracted from the accretion rate of @xmath194yr@xmath6 , @xmath40.3% is transformed in kinetic power in the nlr outflows .",
    "we note that this fraction is of the order of the agn feedback derived in simulations for co - evolution of black holes and galaxies ( 0.5% ) , in order to match the m-@xmath44 relation @xcite .",
    "this kinetic power is somewhat larger than those we have recently derived for a sample of 6 nearby seyfert galaxies showing nlr outflows @xcite , which are in the range @xmath201 .    in order to gauge the impact that the above kinetic power may have in the galaxy",
    ", we estimate the total kinetic energy released if the outflow as now observed lasts for at least @xmath160yrs ( as an estimated duration for the activity phase of the galaxy ) to be @xmath202erg .",
    "this energy can then be equated to the binding energy of the gas mass that could be pushed away from the central region of the galaxy ( following the reasoning in @xcite ) @xmath203 . for @xmath204erg , @xmath205m@xmath8 ( estimated from the galaxy absolute magnitude ) and @xmath206pc ( just beyond the observed outflow ) , we obtain @xmath207m@xmath8 , which is @xmath4 5 times the mass which outflows through the nlr in 10@xmath208yrs .",
    "it is interesting to note that this mass is of the order of the estimated molecular gas mass present in the nuclear region of ngc4151 , as discussed above , being also the typical value observed in the nuclear region of active galaxies in general @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that in the case of ngc4151 the molecular gas reservoir that is needed to trigger the nuclear activity can be blown away by the nlr outflow by the end of the activity cycle .",

    "<S> we have used the gemini near - infrared integral field spectrograph ( nifs ) to map the gas kinematics of the inner @xmath0 200@xmath1500pc of the seyfert galaxy ngc4151 in the z , j , h and k bands at a resolving power @xmath25000 and spatial resolution of @xmath08pc . </S>",
    "<S> the ionised gas emission is most extended along the known ionisation bi - cone at position angle pa=60240@xmath3 , but is observed also along its equatorial plane . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the agn ionizes gas beyond the borders of the bi - cone , within a sphere with @xmath41  radius around the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the ionised gas has three kinematic components : ( 1 ) one observed at the systemic velocity and interpreted as originating in the galaxy disk ; ( 2 ) one outflowing along the bi - cone , with line - of - sight velocities between @xmath5 and 600kms@xmath6  and strongest emission at @xmath7kms@xmath6 ; ( 3 ) and another component due to the interaction of the radio jet with ambient gas . the radio jet ( at pa=75255@xmath3 ) is not aligned with the nlr , and produces flux enhancements mostly observed at the systemic velocity , suggesting that the jet is launched close to the plane of the galaxy ( @xmath0 plane of the sky ) . the mass outflow rate , estimated to be @xmath41m@xmath8yr@xmath6 along each cone </S>",
    "<S> , exceeds the inferred black hole accretion rate by a factor of @xmath0100 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood if the narrow - line - region ( nlr ) is formed mostly by entrained gas from the circumnuclear interstellar medium by an outflow probably originating in the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> this flow represents feedback from the agn , estimated to release a kinetic power of @xmath9ergs@xmath6 , which is only @xmath00.3% of the bolometric luminosity of the agn .    </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence in our data for the gradual acceleration followed by gradual deceleration proposed by previous modelling of the [ oiii ] emitting gas . </S>",
    "<S> our data allow the possibility that the nlr clouds are accelerated close to the nucleus ( within 0@xmath101  @xmath46pc ) after which the flow moves at essentially constant velocity ( @xmath11kms@xmath6 ) , being consistent with nir emission arising predominantly from the interaction of the outflow with gas in the galactic disk .    </S>",
    "<S> the molecular gas exhiibits distinct kinematics relative to the ionised gas . </S>",
    "<S> its emission arises in extended regions approximately perpendicular to the axis of the bi - cone and along the axis of the galaxy s stellar bar , avoiding the innermost ionised regions . </S>",
    "<S> it does not show an outflowing component , being observed only at velocities very close to systemic , and is thus consistent with an origin in the galaxy plane . </S>",
    "<S> this hot molecular gas may only be the tracer of a larger reservoir of colder gas which represents the agn feeding .    </S>",
