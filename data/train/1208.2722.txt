    "extragalactic radio sources comprise both star - forming ( sf ) galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite . in order to understand the history of the universe we must unravel the cosmic evolution of both classes .",
    "the galaxies that host radio sources display a range of different optical spectra .",
    "sf galaxy spectra are made up of direct emission from starlight and emission lines from hii regions , and are quite easily identified at low redshifts .",
    "some radio - loud agn galaxies display strong high - excitation lines , either broad or narrow depending on obscuration and the orientation @xcite , while others have weak or no emission features ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these spectral differences have been attributed to different accretion modes @xcite .",
    "sources without high - excitation lines are fuelled by the accretion of hot gas ( ` hot mode ' ) while high - excitation sources require fuelling by cold gas ( ` cold - mode ' ) .",
    "the radiatively inefficient ` hot - mode ' accretion is driven by the gravitational instability @xcite , and results in a geometrically thick , optically thin accretion disk within the hot broad - line region .",
    "on the other hand , the radiatively efficient ` cold - mode ' accretion results in a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk within the broad - line region , and a narrow - line region further out . `",
    "cold - mode ' accretion may be triggered by a merger event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can also trigger star - formation within the galaxy .",
    "consequently , sources undergoing ` cold - mode ' accretion may appear as ` hybrid ' objects , that is , objects whose radio emission results from both star - formation and an agn component ( e.g. prongs , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite find that the extreme ulirg , f00183 - 7111 , is such an object .",
    "early radio surveys such as the 3c and 3cr radio surveys @xcite had rms levels of a few janskys and detected predominately powerful radio galaxies and quasars , allowing the cosmic history of these sources to be determined .",
    "subsequent studies found that powerful radio galaxies and quasars evolve very strongly with redshift and the space density of these sources at z @xmath5 2 is orders of magnitude higher than in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recent wide - field radio surveys such as nvss @xcite , sumss @xcite and first @xcite have reached rms levels of a few mjy . at these flux densities",
    "the radio source population is dominated by radio galaxies and quasars powered by agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the most powerful of these can be seen out to the edge of the visible universe .",
    "source counts show a well - characterised upturn below 1mjybeam@xmath1 , which is above that predicted from the extrapolation of source counts for agn with high - flux densities .",
    "some studies attribute this to strong evolution of the sf galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while others find a significant contribution from lower - luminosity agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that low - luminosity agn undergo significant cosmic evolution out to z = 0.7 , consistent with studies of the optical luminosity function for agn ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the deepest radio surveys now reach rms levels below 10@xmath6jybeam@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but cover very small areas on the sky .",
    "the distribution of agn and sf galaxies at low flux densities is not well known , with some studies finding the proportion of agn declining with decreasing flux density and emission due to star - formation ( sf ) dominating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while other studies find the distribution is closer to a 50/50 split between sf galaxies and agn down to @xmath550@xmath6jybeam@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of consensus of the distribution of agn and sf at low flux densities is due to the small areas of sky surveyed at these sensitivities . @xcite",
    "provide a brief comparison of the various studies and , in their figure 4 , show that the fraction of sf galaxies at @xmath7100@xmath6jybeam@xmath1 could range from 30 - 80 per cent .    to date , understanding the evolution of the faint radio source population has been limited by the availability of sufficiently deep wide - area radio surveys . with the aim of imaging approximately",

    "the two fields were chosen to coincide with the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ) survey program @xcite , so optical and mid - infrared identifications exist for most of the radio objects .",
    "cdfs also encompasses the southern great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) field @xcite .    the first data release ( data release 1 , or dr1 ) from atlas consists of the preliminary data published by @xcite and @xcite and reaches an rms sensitivity of @xmath530@xmath8jybeam@xmath1 .",

    "the aaomega spectrograph was used in multi - object mode @xcite and nod+shuffle mode @xcite .",
    "while the sensitive principle component analysis ( pca ) based approach for deep observations with aaomega @xcite would likely have resulted in enhanced sensitivity , the technique was still under development at the time of our observations .",
    "we used the dual beam system with the 580v and 385r volume phase holographic gratings .",
    "the 2007 and 2010 observations used the 5700  dichroic beam splitter and covered the spectral range between 3700  and 8500  at central resolutions in each arm of r@xmath51300 per 3.4 pixel spectral resolution element .",
    "the 2008 observations used the 6700  dichroic beam splitter and covered the spectral range between 4700  and 9500 , which allows detection of h@xmath20 to z  @xmath5  0.4 .",
    "each of the three observing sessions over three years was compromised by poor weather , with only @xmath21 of scheduled time able to be used , severely restricting the sensitivity of the observations .",

    "the observations are summarised in table [ obs ] .    the sensitivity limit ( snr@xmath233 per - pixel ) with aaomega for our estimated exposure times was @xmath24 .",

    "optimising the placement of the fibres still resulted in ` spare fibres ' that could not be placed on atlas radio sources .",

    "in the course of measuring the redshift , each spectrum was inspected visually to determine whether the dominant physical process responsible for the radio emission was star - formation ( sf ) or an agn .",
    "this method is similar to that used by previous studies ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite reported that visual classifications can be used with confidence to analyse spectra from 2df , the precursor to aaomega .",
    "sf galaxy spectra are typically dominated by strong , narrow emission lines including the balmer series .",
    "we classified these spectra as ` sf ' .",
    "agn , on the other hand , can have pure absorption - line spectra ( ` e ' ) , absorption - line spectra with some low - ionisation emission lines such as [ oii ] ( 3726 , 3729 ) ( ` e+oii ' ) , emission - line spectra whose line ratios are indicative of agn activity ( ` agna ' ) and broad - line spectra ( ` agnb ' ) . figure [ spec ] provides examples of each type of spectrum .",
    "ten sources had stellar spectra and , upon visual inspection of the field , we attribute this to chance alignments and discard these data from further analysis in this work .",
    "although whether the source is detected is both a function of the source s position in the field , and its luminosity , the actual volume available to the source is dependent only upon its luminosity . that is to say , the source may be distributed anywhere within the total volume .",
    "this is because the volume available to the source is bound by the flux density limits presented in table [ elaisrmstab ] .        where @xmath37 is the solid angle ( in steradians ) subtended by the image x , and d@xmath38 is the maximum comoving distance in mpc for image x. in this way , each source",
