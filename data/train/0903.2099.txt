    "predicting the movement of prices in financial markets is an important problem , more so in the light of the global financial crisis we find ourselves in right now . if we have the means to detect market undercurrents that do not have clear signatures on the surface , we might be able to steer clear of trouble , and perhaps even defuse financial landmines before things get out of hand",
    ". however , there are at present no reliable schemes for short- or long - term predictions , despite the fact that past information on all financial instruments are wholly available @xcite .",
    "this stands in stark contrast to our ability to predict solar and lunar eclipses to very high precision , starting from newton s laws of motion , and much less voluminous initial data .",
    "we believe this is due to the fact that financial markets are complex systems , whose dynamics follow self - organizing principles we do not yet understand .",
    "clearly , an important first step towards writing down any predictive models of financial market dynamics would be to identify the important degrees of freedom . _ a priori _",
    ", we have no clue whether these are individual financial instruments , or specific collections of instruments .",
    "we hence look to the physical sciences for inspiration .      in the physical sciences , we talk about atoms and molecules as if they are real entities .",
    "quantum - mechanically , all atomic and molecular systems must be described by a single many - body wave function @xmath0 whose dynamics is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath1 .",
    "if we admit that the wave function @xmath0 furnishes a sufficient description of the problem , then atoms have no real existence inside a molecule , and molecules have no real existence within an interacting collection of molecules .",
    "nevertheless , it is very useful to continue speaking of them , because they simplify our mental models of the processes that take place within the collection of nucleons and electrons .",
    "this is admissible , and in fact physically meaningful , because the dynamical structures that atoms and molecules participate in evolve over time scales significantly longer than the intrinsic time scales set by nuclear and electronic motion , i.e. there is a separation between nuclear / electronic time scales and atomic / molecular time scales .    to better illustrate how our association of certain collections of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom with atoms , and other collections of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom with molecules arise naturally from this separation of time scales ,",
    "let us imagine a universe containing a single water molecule @xmath2h@xmath3@xmath4o , consisting of ten protons , eight neutrons , and ten electrons . under ordinary conditions , the @xmath4o nucleons and the two @xmath2h protons",
    "are always very well separated spatially , so in principle we have no problem telling them apart . for the ten indistinguishable electrons , however , we can not simply assign eight labeled electrons to @xmath4o , and one labeled electron each to the two @xmath2h .",
    "nevertheless , if we make a movie of the time evolution of electronic densities within the water molecule , we will find an electronic distribution close to @xmath4o nucleus that evolves pretty much independently of the electronic distributions between the @xmath4o nucleus and @xmath2h nuclei .",
    "we think of the former as the density of @xmath4o core electrons , and the latter as the density of the bonding electrons . unlike the @xmath4o core electrons ,",
    "the bonding electrons can not be associated with either the @xmath4o atom or the @xmath2h atom alone .",
    "instead , they must be associated with the two chemical bonds  another conceptual tool we invent to help us understand the nature of stable bound states between atomic species  in the water molecule .",
    "now let us imagine actually producing such a movie , through direct integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the water molecule .",
    "if we assume that the nucleons are static , we can solve this problem in the basis of all possible 10-electron configurations .",
    "some of these configurations will contribute predominantly to the core density , while others will contribute predominantly to the bond density .",
    "because of the nucleon - electron and electron - electron coulomb interactions , the quantum - mechanical amplitudes of these configurations will evolve with time , sometimes rapidly , and sometimes slowly . as a result of these variable rates of time evolution ,",
    "if we examine the configurations contributing predominantly to the @xmath4o core electronic density , over a time interval that is on the order of the electronic time scale , we might find their amplitudes to be sometimes correlated , and sometimes uncorrelated .",
    "in fact , over electronic time scales , some core electronic amplitudes might even be more correlated with bonding electronic amplitudes than with other core electronic amplitudes .",
    "nevertheless , based on our intuitive picture of distinguishable core and bonding electronic densities , and the separation of electronic and atomic / molecular time scales , we expect the long - run averages of core - core short - time correlations , as well as the long - run averages of bond - bond short - time correlations , to tend towards some nonzero values , while the long - run averages of core - bonding correlations tend towards zero .",
    "the understanding that emerges from this dynamical picture is that core and bond amplitudes should not be treated as objects with immutable labels .",
    "instead , they ought to be identified as clusters emerging from a statistical learning procedure , where we repeatedly calculate correlations at the electronic time scale ( the short time scale ) , and examine how the patterns of short - time correlations look like over a much longer duration ( the long time scale ) .",
    "given a collection of unlabeled time - dependent amplitudes , we can always make use of this procedure of statistical clustering at two different ( separated ) time scales to discover the compound objects , things that we would go on to call _ atoms _ and _ molecules_. more generally , if we are given a large number of time - dependent variables , determining how short - time correlations are themselves correlated over longer times would allow us to determine which sets of variables are strongly correlated over long time scales . these strongly - correlated set of variables then serve as good candidates for effective degrees of freedom at the long time scale .",
    "ultimately , for dynamical features as robust as the core electronic densities and the bonding electronic densities , we expect their statistical signatures to be generally insensitive to specific choices of the short and long time scales , so long as the short time scale is comparable to electronic time scales , and the long time scale is comparable to the atomic / molecular time scale . in addition , it should not matter what short - time correlations we evaluate , and what long - time correlations of these we further determine . for some choices of short - time correlations , statistical signatures of the core and bond clusters of amplitudes might emerge fairly quickly during the long - time clustering . for other choices of short - time correlations",
    ", we might have to cluster over a longer time to detect these statistical signatures .",
    "recast as a learning problem , the extraction of robust , and therefore physically meaningful , dynamical features boils down to a simple problem of statistics and statistical significance .",
    "the simplest scheme that implements the two - time - scale statistical clustering procedure outlined above is based on the sign of the rate of change , as shown in figure [ fig : twotimescale ] . in this scheme ,",
    "two scalar variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 are correlated over a short - time window if they are both increasing or decreasing .",
    "otherwise , the two variables are considered to be uncorrelated . over the long time scale , we define their long - time correlation @xmath7 to be the number of times they are correlated with each other at short time scales .",
    "these pairwise correlations can be organized into a long - time correlation matrix @xmath8 , which is the starting point for our identification of strongly - correlated compound objects .",
    "variables are examined within a long - time window , which consists of a large number of short - time windows . in short - time window @xmath9 ,",
    "variable @xmath10 is assigned to the ` @xmath11 ' cluster if @xmath12 , and to the ` @xmath13 ' cluster if @xmath14 , as shown in the middle panel . in the bottom panel ,",
    "we compute long - time correlation matrix @xmath8 , such that @xmath7 is the number of times variables @xmath10 and @xmath15 are assigned to the _ same _ short - time cluster . ]",
    "armed with this understanding , we analyzed five financial markets , the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) , the london stock exchange ( lse ) , the tokyo stock exchange ( tse ) , the hong kong stock exchange ( hkse ) , and the singapore stock exchange ( sgx ) over a two - year period from january 2006 to december 2007 ( see table [ tab : markets ] ) .",
    "these markets are chosen specifically for contrast : the nyse , lse , and tse are mature markets in g7 countries , whereas the hkse and sgx are emerging markets .",
    "presumably , the dynamics in emerging markets should be different from that in mature markets , and thus one might naively expect structurally different self - organizations in these two classes of markets . to keep the datasets manageable , we restricted our analysis to only stocks and stock related securities . since stocks are important components in any financial market , we believe their dynamics alone would offer us valuable insights into the inner workings of the financial world .",
    "lccccc & nyse & lse & tse & hkse & sgx + total number of stocks & 6743 ^ 1^ & 8820 ^ 2^ & 2636 ^ 2^ & 1070 ^ 3^ & 546 ^ 1^ + total number of market sectors & 10 ^ 3^ & 10 ^ 5^ & 39 ^ 5^ & 12 ^ 4^ & 12 ^ 6^ +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +      for each financial market , we looked at the daily price movements @xmath16 of the @xmath17 stocks making up the market . here ,",
    "@xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the price of stock @xmath10 on day @xmath9 . for this choice of data frequency ,",
    "we have effectively selected a short time scale of one day .",
    "our long time scale , chosen to ensure statistical significance @xcite , is the two - year observation period , consisting of 500 + short time windows .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind that for all financial markets , there is a microscopic time scale set by the average trading interval , which can be anywhere between @xmath20 s to @xmath21 s. following the two - time - scale clustering procedure outlined above , we assign stocks @xmath10 and @xmath15 to the same short - time cluster at time @xmath9 , if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are of the same sign . a stock @xmath24",
    "whose price does not change from day @xmath9 to day @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 , is left unassigned . in the long - time correlation matrix @xmath8 that emerges from this procedure",
    ", we find a background correlation level @xmath27 reflecting market - level drifts , experienced by all stock prices , that results from rallies and crashes .",
    "this background correlation level @xmath27 varies from market to market . in general , the larger @xmath27 is , the more liquid the market .    to get a rough sense of the dynamical structures having long - time correlations over and above market - level drifts , we zero matrix elements in @xmath8 below a threshold @xmath28 . as @xmath29 is raised , we go from a dense matrix , telling us that each stock is correlated with a large number of stocks ( though not equally strongly ) , to a sparse matrix , telling us that each stock is correlated only with very few other stocks ( but very strongly so ) . just as surfaces of high constant electronic density frequently reveal the atomic constituents of a molecule , very large matrix elements in @xmath8",
    "reveal the atomic constituents of the given financial market .",
    "we call these small clusters of very strongly correlated stocks",
    "_ financial atoms_. the correlation levels within financial atoms rise significantly above the background level @xmath27 , because the dynamics of atomic stocks are coherent over time scales much longer than the average trading interval , which plays the role of the ` nuclear / electronic ' time scale .",
    "the existence of such financial atoms is evident from earlier studies @xcite , where they are referred to as _",
    "synchronized clusters_. however , the separation of ` nuclear / electronic ' and atomic time scales was not recognized .",
    "the potential of using financial atoms as effective variables to describe real financial markets is also not widely appreciated .    to properly identify these financial atoms in a given market , we need to be careful : just as core electronic densities are different for different atoms , we suspect the correlation levels may also be different for different financial atoms .",
    "this suggests the need for multiple thresholds , instead of a single threshold @xmath29 , if we use agglomerative hierarchical clustering to discover the financial atoms . in order for the association between clusters in the hierarchical clustering tree and atomic / molecular components in the financial market to be statistically robust ,",
    "we require the clusters to be insensitive to variations in the individual thresholds . to accomplish this , one can imagine a sophisticated algorithm starting out with a large number of thresholds , which are progressively merged as they are slowly raised , based on how sensitive the clusters are to these thresholds .",
    "such an algorithm , however , is difficult to implement , and thus we adopt a simpler approach , where we start from a _ seed cluster _ , i.e. a core set of two very - strongly - correlated stocks , and grow the hierarchical cluster outwards .",
    "we call this procedure _ partial hierarchical clustering _ , and the sequence of correlation levels at which new members are admitted into the growing cluster its _ partial hierarchical clustering history_. figure [ fig : phctlinkages ] shows the typical partial hierarchical clustering histories obtained using different linkage algorithms . with all linkage algorithms , the statistical signature to look out for is a sharp change in slope of the correlation level as a function of cluster size .",
    "this can take the form of sharp spikes , sharp drops , or simply kinks .",
    "these statistical signatures have different interpretations for the different linkage algorithms .",
    "we pick the complete link algorithm for our analysis proper , because the sharp drops and kinks in the correlation level can be most naturally interpreted as cluster boundaries .",
    "compared to the statistical signatures used by most existing statistical learning algorithms @xcite , we believe ours is more intuitive .        since the total number of financial atoms in a given market is not known , we discover them iteratively as follows .",
    "first , let us use @xmath30 to denote our long - time correlation matrix , and find the maximum matrix element , @xmath31 .",
    "using @xmath32 as our first seed cluster for complete - link partial hierarchical clustering , we look for the sharpest change in the slope of the correlation level as a function of cluster size , which marks the ` boundary ' of the first candidate financial atom @xmath33 ( see figure [ fig : phctatom ] ) . to find the second financial atom , we zero the @xmath33 rows and columns of @xmath34 , so that the partial hierarchical clustering can proceed independently of constituents of the first candidate financial atom .",
    "we call this modified correlation matrix @xmath35 . again , we find @xmath36 , and use @xmath37 as our second seed cluster for complete - link partial hierarchical clustering . from the sharpest change in the slope of the correlation level , we identify the second candidate financial atom @xmath38 , and proceed to zero the @xmath39 rows and columns of @xmath35 to get @xmath40 .",
    "this iterative procedure mimics a full hierarchical clustering having different thresholds , which we can use to find as many candidate financial atoms as we like .        for a candidate to qualify as a true financial atom",
    ", the constituent atomic stocks must be more strongly correlated with each other than they are with stocks outside of the financial atom .",
    "this ` self - consistency ' criterion defines an _ upper atomic correlation level _ , and if we are to adhere to this ` self - consistency ' criterion strictly , only clusters of stocks with maximum long - time correlation rising above the upper atomic correlation level can be considered to have dynamically self - organized into _",
    "strong _ financial atoms .",
    "this criterion is somewhat restrictive , so we looked for an alternative criterion compatible with the self - organization observed . inspecting the various partial hierarchical clustering histories of the most strongly - correlated seed clusters , we find the correlation levels at which the _ first _ non - atomic stock was admitted into the growing clusters to be tightly clustered around a small number of _ lower atomic correlation levels_. we can therefore define _ weak _ financial atoms to be those candidate financial atoms whose maximum correlations are greater than the average of the lower atomic correlation levels . in table",
    "[ tab : numatoms ] , we show the upper atom correlation level , the average lower atomic correlation level , and the number of financial atoms based on the two criterions , in each of the five financial markets . the compositions of strong financial atoms found in the five equity markets are shown in appendix a.      .the number of strong and weak financial atoms discovered in the five equity markets . also shown",
